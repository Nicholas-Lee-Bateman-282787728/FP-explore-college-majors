2212203,5,B0007IF19K,"As most know, Ray is a biopic of Ray Charles with Jamie Foxx in the starring role.  He does a wonderful job, with a great script telling the story of just how great a musical talent Ray Charles was, balanced with his personal failures.  It does not hide the fact that he was hard to work with, a womanizer, and drug addict.  It tells the story of his life with the scenes from his childhood and how he went blind in flashbacks, and his rise to fame in the ""present"".  Foxx did a great job with the role, playing the part ""blind"" by wearing prosthetics over his eyes so he could try and experience what Ray did.  Interestingly he did not meet with Ray Charles much because he did not want to play the old Ray, trying instead to channel as much of what Ray Charles was like in the 50s and 60s.

The rest of the cast was made up of actors and actresses who, at the time, were still relatively unknown but have risen to various levels of prominence like Kerry Washington, Terrance Howard, Regina King, Bookiem Woodbine etc.  While I will not profess to know anything about the young Ray Charles and the people in his life, I think all the actors did a great job in their respective roles, and while I am sure some liberties with events were taken, it seemed authentic, especially since Ray Charles was involved at least to some extent in the project.

I have the original DVD version of the film, which is a two disc version.  On disc one there are two versions of the movie, the theatrical and extended.  The extended is actually kind of a pain to watch because the scenes are not really blended into the movie.  It plays the theatrical version then all the sudden will cut to an extended scene or deleted scene, then jump back to the theatrical version.  I am not sure if newer releases corrected that, but it made watching the theatrical version much preferable.  Disc 2 are where the bulk of the features are, including two full length musical performances from the film, deleted scenes and then a handful of behind the scenes and making of features.  There are also actor profiles for all the main characters.  All in all good for what is there.",1460764800,,2146,4.411167512690355
2212204,4,B0007IF19K,Jamie Foxx? No words can express or describe his work here.  It is so realistic.  Ray Charles lived a messed up life.,1460419200,,117,4.2727272727272725

The director directed the important moments very well such as when Jamie suffers from drug edict when he tries to overcome from not having drug from the hospital.

I had the DVD version before and it enabled me to watch the extra 25 minutes together with the theatrical verion.
Maybe I don't know how but this bluray version so far won't let me.
It has bonus feature include deleted scenes but doesn't tet me watch together with the main feature.
The only thing I don't like about this film is flash backs. Whenever it goes back to the childhood days, this disturbing visual effects comes along which makes me annoyed. It's just cliche.",1447545600,,753,4.611940298507463

2212273,4,B0007IF19K,"By this point it's pretty hard to do something original with a biopic, and now that I've seen several of them (particularly the musical kind) a pattern has emerged. Typically, they will pick a time period in a person's life/career and focus on a certain personal struggle and how they overcome it. With musicians, this often involves women and substance abuse. 'Tis the same story with Ray Charles. RAY focuses on Ray Charles' beginnings in the music business up through the point at which he came clean off of heroin (around 1966). To round out the narrative, there are flashbacks to his childhood and an extended coda which ties up a significant plot point from before and serves as an epitaph to his life and career (the film came out several months after his death). Because so many biopics follow the same formula, what distinguishes them from one another (other than the subject) is the quality of the performances and the ingenuity with which they are put together, and RAY certainly stands out from the rest thanks in large part to an excellent central performance by Jamie Foxx. The way he inhabits Ray Charles is uncanny at times, although the straightforward dramatic scenes verge on mimicry in a way that stands out more when juxtaposed with the performance scenes. For me, the performance scenes work better because Jamie Foxx was able to capture a realness and immediacy that comes from someone who is intimately familiar with performing music on the stage (as Foxx is also a singer). Beyond that I thought that the editing, particularly in the musical sequences had a certain kinetic energy that brought the performances to life. However, I found it a little distracting that Ray Charles' voice was coming out of Jamie Foxx's body when there was a few early scenes where Jamie Foxx used his own voice to sing. Even still, I got used to it after a while. In general, I thought that everyone gave a good performance, and the film had an excellent ensemble cast. One thing I also thought was done rather well was the hallucinogenic nature of the flashback scenes, which added a layer of artfulness as inner turmoil, with Ray Charles feeling guilty about how his younger brother died. What I felt didn't always work was the general formula and obligatory dramatic moments which hit again and again just how dependent Ray became on heroin. I got a little tired and frustrated with it in WALK THE LINE (although that came out the following year, and followed RAY's playbook) and felt the same way here. Yes, it was a compelling arc to have in a general sense, but it's something that's been played out a little bit too much, in my opinion. Despite the formulaic nature of the plot and story, I had a great time with RAY because of the talented actors who brought it to life, and the energetic and soulful musical numbers. RAY might rely a little too heavily on formula, but at least it's a winning one.",1430006400,,2911,4.698630136986301

2212336,4,B0007IF19K,"Ray created his own distinct sound by blending R&B with gospel. Margie, a background vocalist, was enamored, in awe of his innate musical ability. She was, no doubt, in love with him and when she initiated physical intimacy, he unequivocally informed her from the outset that under no circumstances would he divorce or leave his wife, Della Bea. Stating that, it is not meant to absolve or exculpate him for getting involved, nor did he think so, because it take two to dance the tango. She genuinely believed she could draw him away from Della Bea, becomes pregnant, and had the child. She was crushed when Ray lived up to standing by his wife. Ray also loved her and provided monthly pecuniary support for her and the infant. Della Bea had knowledge of the illegitimate birth (unbeknownst to Ray). If she felt rancor, she quelled it, did not confront him about it, or make an issue of it, because she regarded him with obeisance and deference; sentiments that were mutually shared between them. While on tour, in 1961, Ray refused to play before a segregated audience in Augusta, Georgia. He was sued for breach and barred for life from performing in the state. In 1979, Georgia redressed and abrogated this ban. The elected representatives of the state proclaimed his song ""Georgia on My Mind"" the official state song and issued him a public apology.

2212393,3,B0007IF19K,"Anchored by some powerful performances but ultimately a middling and formulaic biopic, the filmmakers behind Ray should have learned a thing or two from their titular and innovative subject. Based on the life of a man who made his living by daring to be different, too often the film just feels too familiar. And while Foxx's performance represents only the best of Hollywood mimicry, it succeeds only on a surface level and is unable to get to the roots of Charles' signature mannerisms.

2212396,5,B0007IF19K,"Ray is a compelling drama chock-full of some of the best performances of 2004. The film is a trip down the rabbit hole into the life of a legendary American icon whose career had a tremendous impact on musicians of all ages, races, and musical persuasions. Ray chronicles Ray Charles journey from a poor Southern boy raised by a hard-working single mother, to the man who would develop a style imitated but not improved upon to this day. Ray Charles' youth was filled with tragedy, from watching his younger brother drown to losing his sight at the age seven. His no-nonsense mother taught him to take care of himself and not to depend on anyone for help. Ray grew up strong and independent, and his passion for music, which was a strong influence in his life before the loss of his eyesight, never faded. The movie follows his career to the very end.

My wife picked this movie, and I willingly watched it because I was in the mood for a musical biography.  I found this story to be very moving, perfectly and powerfully portraying many dimensions of the human condition.  It was uplifting to see how he was able to achieve so much success despite having to overcome so much adversity.  But we also see just how humanly flawed he was, struggling with heroin addiction during the years when he made his best music, being quite the womanizer, and not much of a father (according to Wikipedia, he had 12 children with 9 women).

2212535,4,B0007IF19K,"Review written by Avery C

Ray Charles Robinson, a pianist phenomenon. The forerunner of soul music and one of the best artists the world will ever see. He died at a fairly old age and has been through everything anyone could possibly think of. He has been through a heroin addiction, affairs with other women, betrayal from his closest manager, becoming blind and a traumatizing childhood. His amazing life of breaking through drug addiction and slowly integrating both whites and blacks in the community was accurately documented in Ray. While some docudramas may stray from what actually happened, this movie does not. Ray depicts his life most extremely accurately, from when he was a child to when he died.

Despite the fact that Jamie Foxx, had to act blind, he performed it extremely well. I was astounded when I saw Jamie Foxx perform that well. Although the screenplay was very average, the performance by the actors was superb. His flashbacks were obvious so not confusing to the audience. The docudrama was thoroughly well done. Even though Ray Charles' actual recording was played on top, it was as if Jamie Foxx was playing it. I thought the music Ray Charlies composed was remarkable and it emphasized the scene harmoniously.

Through Rays' music, he was able to do one unimaginable thing many people can't do--fight against segregation and succeed. When Ray was going to go to Georgia, he refused to play there because of the segregated theater. Even though he was banned, once Georgia became a fully integrated state, he was awarded recognition for being morally strong in his views. Amidst all the Grammy's he won, he announced that his proudest moment was in fact becoming part of the Georgian community. It was very emotional for me to see Ray do this since you needed to be so courageous to do something out of the expectations of others.

Other than the producers showing black people's breakthrough in segregation, this docudrama showed the interaction between blacks and white for celebrities. While I knew most of the interactions that went on between normal civilians, I did not know what the interactions between celebrities and their producers were like. In fact, it wasn't very different. The white people took advantage over Ray's talent. He was given less money than everyone else, not only because he was blind but also because he was black. They didn't think Ray would be smart enough to know that he's being cheated. However, Ray was very strong and left the people that were unfair to him. Although the white people took advantage of Ray, there are a few instances when Ray got back at them. Since the manager's own popularity was derived from Ray's amazing talents in piano, they didn't want to risk losing Ray, giving him anything he wanted; ranging from his own orchestra to his own style and music. This gave Ray a lot of freedom to do whatever he wanted to do which was unusual for an African American. Ray was a very special exception to how blacks were treated in the music industry. When the African Americans weren't as prized as Ray, it was immensely cut throat and if they didn't perform to the manager's expectations, they would be kicked out.

Another interaction that I found extremely interesting in this docudrama was Ray being traded in and out of record labels as easily as black slaves were being traded in the slave markets in the 1800s. Ray went in and out of record labels; when they offered more money to Ray, Ray would go to him, like a dog following the dog treat. This went on and on throughout the whole movie and I didn't like it one bit. However, I had to come to the conclusion that that was the way it was and there was nothing they could do about it.

Ray was a wonderful movie to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were some parts of the movie that I was very shocked by. However, it made me think about how blacks interacted with whites in a new celebrity and musical perspective which not many movies give.",1355011200,,3981,4.720863309352518

2212555,5,B0007IF19K,"The late night movie for yesterday was ""Ray,"" the story of Ray Charles. I found it in my DVD shelves and I must have had it for a while. My wife and I (about 6 years ago) used to buy used (pre-viewed) discs from Blockbuster Stores. Remember them? Well, this one has a sticker and shows the price as 14.99 for a used disc! Hard to believe.

In any case, it's a very good movie and I watched the version that was shown in theaters. Perhaps some day I'll also watch the extended version and the rest of the extra material that comes with the movie. There's two packed discs. The movie follows the life and career of Ray Charles from childhood to death. One is the story of his childhood which runs from his birth up to about when he becomes an entertainer. The other story is of his history as an entertainer. The two stories are overlapped such that the viewer will switch back and forth. It's a little unusual, but works rather well.

I had a major part of my personal musical development in the span from about 1952 to 1959. It was the time of the birth of Rock and Roll and I just loved it! R & R was not a genre as yet during those early days and it was kinda a loose collection of things that didn't fit too well anywhere else. There were elements of gospel, country, rhythm and blues, pop, jazz and novelty tunes all bunched together. If it was somewhat brash, had a strong beat and was offensive to the common populace, it was called Rock and Roll and played only in limited places and on limited radio stations. You had to be a R & R fan to keep track of  what was going on. But it was worth it.

Ray Charles fit into this early R & R grouping and he became renowned for his wonderful songs such as ""Baby, What I'd Say"" and ""Hit The Road Jack"" and many others. It was a wonderful period and living it helps a lot. I liked Charles 50s music best. When he drifted into country and pop and had difficulties with drugs and his record company, my interest fell off and I was enjoying other artists.

I enjoyed the early part of the movie the most, the part that covered the fifties. When it went into the change of record companies and change in style to country, and all the marital and drug problems, my interest in the movie fell off, just as my interest in his music had done decades earlier. However, it's an essential part of the movie and well worth viewing if you want the whole story of Ray Charles.

In any case, it was an excellent movie. Very well done. And the music is wonderful. Surely this one must have picked up a bundle of awards and other accolades. It's one of those kinds of movies, without question.

Ray teaches us to see the ability of a blind man. This movie shows the
struggles and triumphs of Ray Charles.

Ray starts as a young, African American boy growing up on a sharecropping
plantation. Already Ray was born into struggles and on top of that Ray
Charles became blind at age 7. Ray was taught to play the piano at a young
age and it grew to be his passion. Throughout the movie Ray ages and
progresses in the music world and he ended up revolutionizing the industry.
Along with music Ray also fought segregation and combined the cause with
the music industry. A large chunk of the film also revolves around Ray's drug
addiction as he struggled with heroine. That movie also dabbles into Ray's
personal life and his relationship with women as a blind man.

The cast contained many unique characters but they all supported the main
character, which of course, was Ray Charles. Ray Charles was played
by Jamie Foxx who did an outstanding job. After doing research on what
Charles was really like it has been discover that Foxx portrayed the character
of ray perfectly and he completely captured the charismatic character that
Ray Charles is. Foxx also won an Academy Award for best actor. Some of
the great supporting characters include Ray Charles' mother and his wife
who were played by Sharon Warren and Kerry Washington. These women
really added to the movie and helped the viewer understand the character
of Ray Charles when they were with him. The director of this movie was
Taylor Hackford who did a great job on capturing the role of Ray Charles and
everyone who revolved around him. This director really had a passion for
making this movie because with searching for finance, casting and shooting it
took him 15 to make this film. The storyline was very intriguing as they made
the life of a blind man intriguing. Scenes like when Ray Chares' brother dies
and how Ray judges if a girl is beautiful (by touching her wrist) really give the
viewer a deeper understanding into Ray's life.

Based on other reviews this movie is actually very accurate to the actual
life Ray lived. Also based on research this movie is quite accurate. There
have been some names, places and event that had been slightly altered but
overall the movie is realistic. Certain scenes have been found out not to be
completely true like the scene where Ray's brother was drowning and Ray

just stood there, but in real life Ray Charles said he remembered trying to
pull his brother out but couldn't. The key of ""mess around"" in the movie is a G
when in reality it is an E flat. Besides these little things that have a very small
impact on the movie, Ray is historically accurate.

Overall the unknown story of Ray Charles and his ability to overcome his
struggles and rise to triumph make Ray the inspiring docudrama that it is.",1332892800,,2832,4.642714570858283
2212560,4,B0007IF19K,"During the middle of Ray, the highly anticipatory Ray Charles docudrama, he encounters his wife, Della Bea. Innocent and well mannered, Della Bea (Kerry Washington) refuses a first kiss attempt by Ray (Jamie Foxx). Ray, interested, understands that this girl isn't afraid to speak her mind. Indeed, instead of praising him several hours earlier after hearing his record, she wanted him to discover his true sound.

A few weeks late when Ray returns from a road trip with his band, Della Bea decides to pick up the pace in their relationship. After a moment of romance, Ray trusts her enough to take off his signature sunglasses, revealing his eyes, blind from glaucoma at the age of seven. Ray asks if he can call her ""Bea"", and after she agrees, suddenly jumps to the nearby piano to begin singing to her. Bea is astounded by the lyrics of his song, ""I Got A Woman"", claiming turning a gospel song into a song about women is sacrilegious.

At this point as well as others, Ray overdramatizes events, which are often accompanied by a hit song. The film suggests that this was the moment when Ray combined R&B and gospel music, ultimately leading to popularity, but also astonishment and resentment from some of the Christian community. They claimed that his use of religious music to depict sexual themes and make profit was offensive. Yet, the movie proposes that Ray had been brought up in Georgia, where he learned from a variety of musical genres, and encouraged listeners to not be so conservative in their taste.

However, the film is indeed interesting. Depicting Ray's career in episodes his first performances with the McSon Trio; companionship with aspiring jazz musician Quincy Jones; refusal to play in front of a segregated audience in Georgia (causing his banishment from the state for over a decade); issues of trust with his manager, Jeff Brown; a short affair with backup singer Marry Ann; his growing relationship with Ahmet Erteger and Atlantic Records; then his monumental contract with ABC records, where Ray earned seventy five percent of all the earnings.

While these moments in Ray's life need to be noted, the movie tends to over simplify and depict them as one-by-one events. However, the extraordinary talent and excellence of the music helps Ray through its flaws. What's most intriguing is the way the movie continuously offers little inventions, such as how Ray improvised ""What'd I Say"" with his band and singers on the spot, and how it's suggested that the influence from ""Hit the Road"" came from an argument with his second lover, Margie. Yet, the simplicity of Ray's thinking process does not detract, but in fact makes the film all the more enjoyable.

Less enjoyable are the movie's representations of Charles' childhood and emotional troubles, often seen as repetitive flashbacks that over dramatize and under explain the real causes to his despair. The young Ray is shown looking at colored bottles hung on a tree outside of his home in Georgia. The scene is then cut to the image of the bottles blurred, to represent his loss of sight and longing for childhood. Even less successful is the film's depiction of Ray's guilt and death of his brother, George. Factually, Ray attempted to save his brother from drowning in the tub; instead of simply standing there thinking it was all a joke. The movie's false depiction only leads viewers to misinterpret Ray's personality, only to attempt to show his sincerity through overdramatized and tedious hallucinations in the future.

Furthermore, Aretha, Ray's mom, gives Ray strength by constantly telling him to ""never let nobody or no nothing make [him] a cripple"". Aretha encourages him to use his other senses to get around, and always ""stand on his own two feet"". While this makes sense because Ray ends up pursuing a musical career, the film often overuses the devices, as he overcomes a serious heroin addiction by specifically remembering his mother's words, then has a dream in which he regains his vision and meets his brother and mother, who lovingly reinforces that George's death wasn't his fault. Although Jamie Foxx has a perfect imitation of Ray's blindness throughout the film, this scene suggests that literal vision is the path to psychological insight.

As this scene suggests, the movie's struggling with blindness as a metaphor is not always clear. The movie often worries about the limitations from blindness, and uses Ray's flirtatious interest in women to enforce his apparently lost manliness. Moreover, when Ray auditions for a white country band in Georgia, the bandleader borrows a pair of white, feminine sunglasses to cover Ray's eyes because they might ""scare"" customers. The picture then lingers on Ray in these ridiculous glasses, forming a joke that connects his blindness, sexuality, and race in strange ways.

Similarly, the film allows Ray to create a connection between his addiction to efforts to deal with his own personal darkness and problems. However, his addiction is reduced to the conventional movie scene, where someone discovers his drug use and consequently is the betrayal of a loved one.

The film's need for women characters and overused movie techniques to create a dramatic storyline was a bit disappointing. Yet, Jamie Foxx's performance truly shines, and the magnificence of Ray Charles himself leaves any docudrama on his achievements and troubles in my good books.",1332806400,,5404,5.042553191489362

Of course he rises above it, kicks the drugs (with perfunctory tough love from a doctor in the clinic).

2212593,5,B0007IF19K,"Jaime Foxx gives a sensational performance during his portrayal of the musical legend Ray Charles.  As someone who often focuses on non-verbal communication, I was most impressed by Foxx's mannerisms.  With Foxx's acting and musical talents (he went to college on a classical piano scholarship), he truly is by far and away the best actor for this role!  Foxx's tone, voice infliction, and commitment to be blind (his eyelids were shut using silicon synthesis during all shooting days) during the role were also astounding.

Taylor Hackford (director and producer) shows you Ray at his most vulnerable times (addiction, possible loss of family) and at his most successful times (Ray inked a record deal that was better than Frank Sinatra's at the time).  In the bonus footage, Hackford comments that the film was 15 years in the making; more directors would gladly wait 15 years if they were certain to make a film as memorable as Ray.  The music is astounding and the supporting characters are memorable.  Overall, this film is as enjoyable to watch on the 9th time as it is on the 1st.",1269734400,,1087,4.875

I had no idea he was involved in such shameful scandal.  But what's even more interesting is that at least one of his scandals was based on a noble cause instead of a shameful one.

Ray is a perfect picture of humanity.  Struggling through through neverending internal and external obstacles, and always on the verge of total collapse no matter how high his talent and hard work had taken him.  In fact, the higher he went, the closer to collapse he seemed to get.  Why is it that so often no blessing or curse deters us from loving the very things that kill us?

This is one of those movies I watch on a regular basis, even though I know exactly what's going to happen. Because it feels like visiting an old friend. ABOUT THE HD-I feel that any movie that you want to watch repeatedly is worth owning on HD or Blue-Ray. If...you have a TV that is capable of showing the difference. The one thing I was hoping for was that the vintage footage from the late 40's and early 50's would be sharper. No. And thinking on it it shouldn't be. The hi-def format does just what it's supposed to do. Reveal the old film for what it is...old film. But the rest of the movie does benefit greatly.

This is a slick-looking film/DVD that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I only wish there was more music in here. When it's inserted, it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it.

The only negative I had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of Charles' problems being blamed on one early childhood event.  That tragedy was used as cop-out for all Ray's misdoings as an adult.

2212618,4,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"" is what I would describe as a standard Hollywood version of a high budget biography film.  What makes this movie special is the subject; Ray Charles.  We get a somewhat complex picture of Ray Charles with interspersed flash backs to give us ""deep background"".  It was generally known that Mr. Charles had his weakness for drugs but I didn't realize how strong the addiction was.  The acting is very good but I had a real problem understanding much of the dialogue of Jimmie Foxx; the actor who plays Mr. Charles.  I don't recall Ray Charles as a mumbler although I don't know that I saw him all that much in interviews or talk shows.  However, if it was the was he spoke, there was no need to put that into the movie and leave many in the audience scratching their heads and wondering what he said.  For this he won the Best Actor Oscar?  What is the key to ""Ray"" is the music.  It was well presented and I was singing to myself for days after.  Enjoy the music and see if you can get subtitles.",1220140800,,1001,4.304812834224599
2212619,2,B0007IF19K,"In the opening scene of the 2004 docudrama ""Ray"" we see a tree hung with bottles to trap evil spirits, and Ray's mom Aretha telling him ""Don't let nothin' or nobody make you no cripple."" He didn't, but director Taylor Hackford did. It's certainly tough for anyone to tranform the 73 year life of the genius of Ray Charles into a two hour movie and make it work. Still, a whole lot more of that great music and a whole lot less of his failings would have gone a long way toward fixing a movie more interested in the evil in the bottles than the beauty of their sound.

 Through a series of flashbacks, done in the vivid color of the then-seeing Ray, we learn about his personal ""demons"". Well, the first of them anyway. At the age of 5 he saw his brother drown, although in autobiographies he tells of trying to get him out unsuccessfully. Water seems to follow screen Ray everywhere after that, done to death at the mercilessly artful hands of Hackford. In an autobiography, Mr. Charles said that although the tragedies of losing his brother and then his mother were the worst things in his life, they were ""strangely enough, extraordinarily positive for me."" Typical, remarkable Ray. It wasn't the guilt, but the humility and drive that made Ray, RAY.

 There are scenes of great courage and strength, especially those involving his mother, Aretha, played with amazing poise by actress Sharon Warren. These scenes go a long way to helping the movie because we get a sense of where Ray got his inner voice, the voice that helped him become and play and sing and ""see"". Jamie Foxx is totally believable in his role as Ray Charles. It's his fingers we see playing, and his eyes we believe really cannot see. Curtis Armstrong gives a fine performance as Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records, the man who saw the spark and encouraged the originality of the flame in Charles's music.

 Ray Charles had some remarkable people in his life. He was a magnet for them through his music and his can-do attitude. Hackford, however, tries to convince us that he was much more a magnet for his vices: heroin and women. We're shown the sweet Ray and talented Ray, then lots and lots of the broken, addicted, nasty Ray. Oh, and then there's some music, too. The great songs are in there, of course, ""Hit the Road, Jack"", ""What'd I say"", ""It's All Right"" and some others. But we're talking about an original inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, creator of over 250 albums, and the inventor of Soul. Hollywood moral: Music is nice, but drugs sell tickets.

 Taylor Hackford describes the movie he has made as an ""odyssey"" with ""certain events fictionalized"" and ""condensed"". To those, I'd have to say ""for whom?"", ""no kidding"" and ""miniaturized"". It sugar-coats the ending with kicking his drug habit, dealing with his brother's death and making up with his wife (who he later divorced) all in the last five minutes. And the last 40 years of his life, when some of his best work was produced? Read about it in the blurbs at the bottom while you watch the credits.

 In truth, this docudrama serves to introduce Ray ""The Genius"" Charles to people who, bizarrely, may not know of him. While he overcame the potentially crippling effects of tragedy, blindness, racism, drug abuse, and infidelity, a proper ""life story"" of this man should focus on his real triumph--his music. Mr. Hackford should remember Aretha's words to Ray at the end of the movie: ""You may be blind, but you ain't stupid."" Neither are we.",1212364800,,3494,4.63915857605178
2212620,2,B0007IF19K,"Joel Siegel from Good Morning America calls Ray ""One of the best films I ever saw."" I couldn't disagree more. Ray is an attempt to present the life story of the musical genius, Ray Charles Robinson. His career all begins in Seattle; his journey to the city from North Florida 1948 served as the movie's opening scene. The plot revolves how a black man was able to become a star in a segregated America. Blind since the age of seven, Ray shows how the musician was able to overcome this disability, and become one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century. However, after the two and a half hours of pure story-telling, viewers of Ray are unable to grasp a unique message. Instead, they are left with the same clich theme of finding happiness not with fame nor drugs, but within family.
Ever since the beginning of the film, Ray seemed to be a submissive man. He listened to whites, answered questions, and was not afraid of being ridiculed. ""We all gotta play Jim Crow down here [in Georgia]"" was one of his quotes that depicted him as a passive character that accepted black inferiority. In fact, it seemed like Ray hardly knew who he was. When asked ""who is the real Ray Charles"", he replied with a simple ""Who's he?"" and nothing more. Ray eventually strengthens his sense of individuality through the style of his music over the course of the movie.
Ray's blindness serves as his weakness in that it makes him dependent to an extent, but he never fails to give up his ambitions. He tries hard to be a present father, but is often caught up with the inability to live his career and family life at the same time. To the audience, Ray's career may have seemed too easy for him. The only difficulty he faces are the difficulties he inflicts on himself, like getting involved with drugs and affairs. ""If I can feel the music, that means it's real"" is his excuse for continuing the use of heroine. Offers and contracts are made to him so frequently that he could come and leave whenever he wanted. The racial struggle is not emphasized to the intense point where the audience can see what blacks went through at that point of history.
At the same time of being the subservient yes-man, Ray is presented as almost supernatural. His paranormal hearing skills, making hits off his fingertips, and his overall smooth impression is simply unreal. He is such a suave gentleman that he seems to talk in lines of poetry and never minds about anything. Even when his wife found the drugs in his cabinet, seriousness was the last thing he embraced; he simply dismissed his wife's concern, and left the house for another tour with his band. He is nave, modest, but most of all unconvincing. In addition, the biography is more from an objective point of view, as opposed to telling his story from one character's eyes. This affects the audience in that viewers may fail to make a connection with Ray's deeper persona because that link was not made accessible.
A notable component of the movie is the incorporation of flashbacks to Ray's childhood. The flashbacks are shot with a more mellow and warm light, indicating a more harmonious atmosphere and nostalgia every time Ray reminisces about his childhood. The scenes sometimes seemed a bit random. The lack of smooth transitions makes portions of the movie choppy, but this may have been intentionally done to portray the incoherence of Ray's life. Specific details include the death of his younger brother that never stops to haunt him, but more importantly, the teachings of independence from his mother, which highly impact his life as Ray faces his challenges. ""You won't be no cripple. Won't be no charity case"" is the reoccurring message that Ray remembers from his mother, and drives him to stay strong at multiple scenes of the movie.
 Ray portrays Ray Charles as a bigger hero than he actually was. In the modern society, overcoming drug addictions are seen as a duty, not deserving respect or recognition. We don't see teenage girls checking into rehab being applauded by the community, but this was not the case with Ray. Ray should not have gotten into his heroine addiction in the first place, but the movie makes the success of him breaking his habit like it was a big feat that he was able to conquer; it as if his blindness becomes a legitimate excuse for his drug use. Apart from the recollection of overcoming substance abuse, the movie is generally able to select the more pivotal moments of Ray's life. These mostly include the entering and leaving of various music deals, and memories with his mother.
The jazz scene during this time period was filled with illicitness. Many whites entered jazz clubs to escape from their realities and immerse into a world of sex and drugs. This guilty pleasure is not clearly portrayed by the movie, as scenes of Charles' performances are always cheerful and in good spirits. The ""Rocking Chair"" nightclub had performers who seemed like amateurs and didn't have anything better to do. The Chitlin' Circuit and Halfmoon Club were like black hangouts, places to dance and have fun. The true reality of the jazz clubs is not accurately portrayed, and unfortunately lost most of the sensation of forbidden bliss.
The weakest quality of the movie is that it fails to leave a mark on its audience. It is forgettable as the story is developed through the recycled and overused story of any individual. His journey revolves around the same clich theme of pursuing happiness and not being able to find it in fame or drugs, and finally realizes it's in his family. But even after this subtle realization, the message is conveyed poorly. All his happiness that he found towards the end of the movie was external, such as buying his wife a new house and showering children with presents. The film shows no apparent ""internal revelation"" that could have been well developed into an inspiring point to the audience.
 Despite the overwhelming of unoriginal, repetitive themes, one especially laudable quality of the movie is Jamie Foxx's performance. Through the making of the movie, Foxx actually spent time with Ray Charles, learning of his mannerisms and tones of speech. Without a doubt, Foxx is able to portray a Ray Charles very closely to the real individual. His lip-synched performances highly deserve commendation for being strikingly believable.
Overall, Ray is a movie that was produced with great effort and good intentions. To compress seventy years of life into two and a half hours is indeed a challenge, but the inability of the producers to present an inspiring, distinctive journey of the musician makes the movie dull and insipid. Even with rushed scenes and conversations, the banal idea of internal struggle of searching one's identity and being content with life made the film tedious to watch.",1211932800,,6813,4.802385008517888

2212638,4,B0007IF19K,"A lot of love circulates around Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning performance here, and yes he did do a wonderful imitation of the real thing, but to me `Ray' has a lot more deserving areas to give consideration and appreciation.  For one, the set designs are brilliant, the lighting and mood of just about every scene is fantastic and the musical numbers, while all actual recordings, are choreographed in such a way that you could swear Foxx did all his own singing.  Case in point, there is a scene where Ray is singing in a club and in the recording some of the first words out of his mouth are mumbled and so to make it authentic Jamie knocks the microphone off balance for a moment.  It's the little touches like that one that make this movie authentic, accurate and worth while.

I did enjoy Foxx, so don't get me wrong, but I did feel that his work in `Collateral' was more deserving of the praise.  The main problem I have with Foxx's performance is that he invests so much time and energy into getting Ray down that he forgets to infuse enough of himself into the performance to make Jamie the actor stand out aside from Ray the character.  But, with that little jab of criticism I will admit that he's a force on screen and demands you pay attention.

That said, to me the real star of this film is the man behind the camera, Taylor Hackford.  His acute eye for detail is fantastic here, and is a huge step up from his previous work.  Technically `Ray' is far from my favorite biopic, even in the year of the biopic it falls short of perfection and or utter brilliance, but when `Ray' hits its mark it hits it with such beautiful depth and clarity that it makes up for its minor shortcomings.  Did it deserve a `Best Picture' Oscar nomination?  Not really, but I'm not going to whine about that too much.

Another aspect of the film that shines like a diamond among pearls is the impressive female supporting cast, all of which deserved any and all recognition and praise for they all were essential in not only developing the man that was Ray into a full blown character study but they were also pertinent in making `Ray' the film a film entertaining and relatable from beginning to end.  Kerry Washington, an actress I've just fallen in love with over the years, gives such a brutally honest performance as Charles wife, the woman who stands by her man and supports him despite his addictions to drugs and loose women.  Regina King gives probably the most explosive performance of the bunch as Margie, one of Ray's backup singers and his obsessive secret lover.  Her brilliance on screen is matched only by her spunk and heart and it's a true pleasure to watch her chew each and every scene she encounters.  Sharon Warren also does a splendid job as Ray's mother and is sure to stand out as a remembered favorite.

The life of Ray Charles was a hard one, full of deceit, drugs, women and pressure.  He was abused, taken advantage of and used and on the other side he abused, took advantage of and used others in the process, but the true story of Ray Charles is a story about overcoming our weaknesses and growing into the person we knew we had in us all along, the person who has been dying to come out but just needed to opportunity.  My one big disappointment with this film is that it never truly shows us the recovery Ray made.  We see his struggles, his problems and his faults.  We see him finally realize he needs help but we never see him truly change, we just read about it in a montage of newspaper clippings that litter the final frames of the film.  It's a small quaral I know, but it's one I'm not ready to let go of.  If the ending had only added as much depth as the beginning and middle had then maybe this would have been a more deserving film to me, but in the end, even with my issue included, `Ray' is still a wonderful biopic, one that I'm happy to have seen and will most definitely see again.",1182384000,,3922,4.394190871369295
2212639,4,B0007IF19K,"The movie ""Ray"", directed by Taylor Hackford, is a compelling drama about the journey of a man battling against poverty, racism, and of course, overcoming his blindness, in order to express his talent. It is based on a true story about the life of a black musician named Ray Charles.

Ray Charles' youth was filled with tragedy, from watching his younger brother drown to losing his sight at the age seven. His mother taught him to take care of himself and not to depend on anyone for help. Ray grew up strong and independent, and his passion for music, which was a strong influence in his life before the loss of his eyesight, never faded. As a teenager, Ray set out on his own shortly after his mother's death and made his way across the United States from Florida to Seattle. Soon after arriving in Seattle, Ray's real journey of making himself renowned began.

Jamie Foxx holds the challenging role of Ray Charles and greatly depicts the latter's life in this movie. ""Ray"" is an interpretation of the extraordinary life of Ray Charles who, in spite of his inability to see, became a wonderful musician and internationally renowned performer. The task of playing the role of a person the whole world knows is very difficult, but doing so and playing the role of a blind person at the same time seems impossible! Well, Jamie did it. During the whole span of the movie, it feels as if Ray Charles is really back with us. As the movie unfolds, we discover a character so full of life and passion that it seems real. Foxx's musical abilities further complete the portrait, not imitation, of Ray Charles. Indeed, the film features many of Ray Charles songs and it does a good job of tracing his music career.

However, Jamie Foxx's acting skills are overshadowed by the length of the movie, which is 150 minutes long and holds a lot of repetition. Also, we are under the impression that the director is trying to cram every important fact of Ray's life into the whole 2  hours. It would have been possible to remove from 10 to 20 minutes of scenes that render us impatient and seem unnecessary, however this would have made it hard for the director to input many of Ray Charles' hits in the movie, which somewhat makes up for the waiting.

In addition to the lengthiness of the movie, the large emphasis on Ray's personal life, instead of showing us more of the making of his music, was exasperating. Alright, it doesn't hurt to know that Ray was a womanizer who often got high on heroin, but brutally showing a side of Ray Charles that is unknown to most people may not be what every audience is looking for. What's more the film is supposed to captivate our attention, not bore us. A lack of suspense and drama would certainly be the cause for that: I felt my attention weaving on and off during the whole movie.

As a whole, I think that ""Ray"" is an excellent movie which reveals many of the problems our society faces today and shows the competitiveness present in the world, notably in the music realm. The long length of the movie is forgiven thanks to the outstanding acting of Jamie Foxx. However, I still believe that naming ""Ray"" as best movie of the year 2004 is a stretch. At least we were able to relive the numerous hits that Ray Charles wrote during his successful career.",1181088000,,3285,4.549915397631134

2212641,5,B0007IF19K,"It took me a long time to finally get round to watching 'Ray'. The wait was well worth it - this is a terrific biopic - but not just a biopic, this is an outstanding movie on any terms.

Whether a fan or not (I wasn't) most everyone will be aware at some level of Ray Charles' music. He's made that big an impact. This movie endeavours to show two periods of his life. The principal part of the movie follows his rise to fame, and corresponding fall into drug use and infidelity, climaxing in his redemption, kicking the habit, and recommitting his lfe as a husband and an entertainer. The second strand is told in flashback, showing Ray as a boy, before and during the process of him becoming blind - explaining (perhaps a little too neatly for some peoples taste) his need to escape into drugs, and how he managed to overcome the constraints of blindness with the help of his mothers tough guidance. His mother is clearly the key character in his life, teaching him firmly but with love how to enhance his sense of hearing and touch in order to compensate for his blindness. His mothers words echo frequently through the movuie when she says, 'Always remember your promise to me. Never let nobody or nothing turn you into no cripple.'. These two tales interweave almost seamlessly, showing not just the facts but the effects on the older man of the younger mans history. As an adult, the cinematography might be beautiful and the tones warm and rich, but Ray the man is shown warts and all - this is a man who used people shamelessly, not least the women in his life, and the movie does not shirk from showing him in those terms. This has the effect of really drawing you in. Instead of a whitewashed version of his life, you feel you are scratching the surface of a person just a little here, and it makes for fascinating viewing because it rings true.

Taylor Hackford the director has done an incredible job of creating striking visuals, from the dusty ochre coloured streets of his youth, through to smoky bars, and on to the over the top glitz of LA and swanky nightclubs - all the period settings ring true and are shot to perfection. You can tell this was a labour of love - in fact, Hackford bought the rights to the story back in 1987, but could not find a studio release - it was only after independent financing that Universal studio stepped in to facilitate its release. It must be a matter of some satisfaction to him that Ray Charles was able to see the first edit of the movie before he died, before the movie was actually released.

Then there is the acting - much has been said of Jamie Foxx's acting here, and it's all true- he embodies the part in a way which is uncanny - his efforts, going to Braille school, wearing prosthetics which made him blind during shooting, studying Ray Charles himself, have really paid off. However this is a performance made up of more than gimmics and prosthetics, this is the performance of a lifetime, giving the character real depth and depth of reality. Then there is the supporting cast - i cant even name them, because every role in the movie rings ttrue, a credit to the casting and to the actors.

All in all, sure there are bound to be more truths to be told about his life, but this will certainly be the best biopic made of his life, and comes at a most fitting time. terrific cast, script, cinematography and direction - a real winner.

post script - almost left no room to mention - the 2 disc version comes laden with extras on both the movie and ray - with delted scenes and extended musical scenes. Worth watching, when you think that Jamie Foxx did all the piano playing himself!",1171411200,,3649,4.440298507462686

2212653,5,B0007IF19K,"The Oscars have been and gone, and one film has left critics stunned.

Jamie Foxx plays the part of Ray Charles Robinson, and pulls off an astonishing resemblance to the legend who died in late 2004.

The story begins as Ray is standing waiting for a bus to take him on his quest for fame in Seattle, however, when he is introduced to a Jazz band he hopes to work with, they doubt his abilities as he is blind. Despite the fact he is blind and black, he convinces them to give him a chance. They are astonished to see a blind man play the piano so well.

He finally reaches his destination of Seattle, and is forced to play in a talent night when one of the participants falls sick. Despite being unprepared he is persuaded to perform, after being tricked into taking drugs to calm him down. The audience stare in amazement, and immediately, he is snapped up by the owner and becomes his manager... as well as his lover.

Ray and his band start to sell out on every gig they play, however, he is set back by a childhood nightmare. He feels he is surrounded by water, which causes Ray great pain. Despite this, Ray continues to sell out, and before long he is spotted b a big record company, who offer him a deal. However, his manager isn't too kean to let her biggest money earner go. His manager seems to be hiding something from Ray about the deal, so he decides to speak to the record label himself, and finds his manager has been lting to him about the deal. In a moment of fury he leaves and travels the country with his new band and manager. However, drugs get the better of him, and despite recently becoming maried, he still has th urge to sleep with other women, even with a baby on the way. His ever growing heroin use leads the police to raid his room. No the only way for Ray to stay out of prison is to undergo rehabilitation and completely rid himself of heroin use.

During his rehabilitation, we find that the reason for his flashbacks is because his brother drounds as a youngster, and he feels he is to blame as he could have saved his. He continually sobs thinking of how he could have saved his beloved brother, and the constant crying and rubbing his eyes leads to Ray becoming blind.

Ray contyinues to become better and better as an artist, and because of this, his wealth grows and grows. We later find out his secret lover dies.

""Ray"" is a hearwarming story, and his fears of blaming himself for his brothers death is put straight when he sees his mother and his brother in a dream, where his brother denies Ray is to blame. Also, he receives a public apology from his home town of Georgia who abnned him after he refused to perform there due to racist problems.

""Ray"" is an enthrilling movie which is likely to attract all age roups. This true life story is a dedication to Mr Ray Charles who died in 2004, and Jamie Foxx's representation of him is outstanding. I would certainly urge everyone to watch the film, especially those with a musical interest. I personally loved this film, and, if asked to rate it out of five, I would have to rate it 5 out of 5.

I hope you enjoy it.",1170201600,,3108,4.317324185248713
2212654,5,B0007IF19K,"Critics have generally raved about this film, and why not? Jamie Foxx's portrayal of one of the world's greatest singers is marvelous (the soundtracks are Charles's originals). Born into grinding, rural poverty in Albany, Georgia, Charles's mother Aretha moved her family to Florida when he was an infant. By age 7 Charles was completely blind from glaucoma. This film tracks his life from then until 1966 or so when he finally beat a twenty-year heroin addiction. But I had several disappointments. By ending when Charles was only 36, this film neglects the entire last half of his life. His addiction to drugs and women (he fathered 12 children and was divorced twice), the powerful influence of his mother who taught him to avoid self-pity and to be his own person, and his guilt over his failure to save his little brother from a drowning accident when he was five, all figure more prominently than his musical genius. In his fifty-year career Charles performed 10,000 concerts, won 12 Grammys, and charted 85 singles. I wanted to learn more about how this genius fused Gospel, blues, country, jazz, and big band music into a raucous style all his own. Perhaps it is impossible for any film to capture a figure so much larger than life. Charles himself was involved in the making of this film, and at the end of the day, despite the feel of an unoriginal soap opera script (music, drugs, philandering, and racism), it is well worth seeing.",1169596800,,1443,4.7991967871485945
2212655,5,B0007IF19K,"As musical bio-pics go,'Ray' is hard to top. It's up there with,'Amaedaus' with the added challenge of depicting a well-known public image. Foxx is totally convincing and his lip-syncing of his master's voice from 50s and 60s hits is nigh on perfect. It would be easy, on such a mercurial trip, to put the pedal to the floor on Charles's legendary sexual and heroin excesses. Yet, at no point, did I wince at possible gratuitous, myth-making with a sense of overkill. The bonus disc has Charles coaching Foxx on piano, and of course, this is the lynch pin to the success of the movie, the fact that the actor isn't acting the music. He's not Ray Charles. But he is an actual musician and thus gives the director the benefit of being able to pan from keyboard shots to the musicians entranced face which enhances the sense of documentation rather than simulation. Foxx seems to have been born to this role His is a performance of supreme devotion and richly deserves the applaudits it's gathered. Ray's hunger for success and dealing with the administrative moguls is crisp without being condescending. The lads at Atlantic are given very sympathetic portraits. The retrieved early childhood scenes glove well. Whether the guilt trip over his younger sibling's drowning is valid, ostensibly Charles gave it the thumbs up. More likely the discrimination he had to contend with from his music-business buddies, and the ambience of the entertainment world's easy congress, seduced him. That he survived and generated the music he did is the outstanding fact and the balance sheet, for all his considerable foibles, reads in positive ink.",1169337600,,1633,4.963503649635037

It also covers very well how Ray's mother had a positive influence on his life and how she insisted he be strong and assertive in spite of his blindness.

I'm not exactly a huge fan of Ray Charles. I mean, I've heard some of his big hits, but it's not like I own any of his albums. Still, I thought this was a rather interesting insight into the man.

It's a film that's not exactly in chronological order. There are flashes back from Ray's early career to Ray's childhood, glimpses of bits and pieces that don't make sense until Ray comes to terms with them. I'm not really a fan of jumbled chronologies in biographical pictures, but it wasn't too bad here. Jamie Fox played Ray really well, I thought, in his movements, his phrases and his personality. They show some footage of the real Ray Charles toward the end, and I thought they were pretty similar. The way the singing and music was handled was done really well too. I was never sure when it was Jamie Fox doing an impersonation or whether he was miming to an old Ray Charles recording. The sets are also really good, and really evoke the times.

Worth a look for fans of Ray Charles, fans of biographical pictures and lovers of music.",1156636800,,1190,4.47926267281106

I never trust Hollywood to tell the unembelished truth when it comes to fact based movies.  But from this movie Ray does not come across as a very likeable guy.  I never knew he was a heroin addict and a womanizer with fleeting loyalty for friends.  But Jamie Foxx does a great job convincing me he is Ray Charles.

The problem with this movie is that it is just too long and drags in several spots.  How many flashbacks to his childhood do we really need?  The story covers Ray's life up to the 1970's and it feels like it does so in real-time.  At least the HD DVD transfer is very good with great picture quality and an awesome soundtrack.

2212726,4,B0007IF19K,"Ray is the story of the legendary Ray Charles, a man who went blind at the age of 7 but still managed to become of the greatest music icons of jazz and others in the world. Jamie Fox plays Ray and does a great job showing the emotion of how one man went for everything he wanted, managed to get it, but almost lost it when drugs and the need for women entered his life. This is one movie that needs to be seen for someone who wan'ts some inspiration of their own.

Ray Charles was born in a poor African American neighborhood in Florida. After going blind at a very young age, it seemed like he would not accomplish anything at all. But with the help of his strong supporting mother, Ray went on to challenge racism in the music world, became a smash hit, and almost went overboard after realizing that women and drugs offered a lot more excitement than the top of the music world.

Some people compared this to Jonny Cash's movie, Walk the Line. I think both are extremely well done movies, and this is one movie that needs to be seen in order to fully understand what one man had to go through to reach his goals in life.

Extras include:

Commentary by Director Taylor Hackford

14 deleted scenes

""Ray Remembered"" [A look at the real Ray Charles]

9 additional music performances

""The Women of Ray""

And a small booklet showing the life of Ray Charles

2212727,4,B0007IF19K,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was when I watched it.  Whereas I admit that Jamie Foxx does a great job with his portrayal of Ray Charles, I still think he is a much overrated actor who will probably never do anything worthwhile again (thus, he'll always be remembered as the guy that played Ray Charles so well).  At times, it didn't feel natural, like he was trying hard to do an impersonation, but for the most part, you felt like he was Ray Charles.  I loved how he played and sang his own parts, which added to the movie so much more than if he was lipsynching and not really playing the piano.  And I've never been a fan of Ray Charles' music but found myself liking it more as the movie went along because of all the emotion that was put into each song.  As many other reviewers stated, Ray was definitely an imperfect man who struggled with a lot while overcoming so much.  While at times the movie seemed to be repeating itself (girls, drugs, girls, drugs), its pace is excellent and the flashback scenes are extremely powerful.  I think Jamie Foxx had some strong emotional scenes that he tackled well, although I think that he didn't deserve to win best actor that year (Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda and Jim Caveizel in Passion of the Christ - who wasn't even nominated! - seemed to be much stronger.  Even Leonardo DiCaprio had a stronger performance as Howard Hughes).  I think a nomination was all he deserved, but oh well!  Great movie, small flaws, and it served its purpose - it brought you an entertaining movie that held nothing back, taught us a lot about Ray Charles, and had great music.  Not nearly as good and powerful as Walk The Line (which dealt with similar themes - brother's death, addictions, women that stood by their side, and music that lasted decades), but this movie is definitely worth checking out.",1150156800,,1854,4.488095238095238
2212728,5,B0007IF19K,"I really enjoyed watching Jamie Fox play Ray Charles simply because he did such a great job being Ray Charles.  It totally felt like you were watching the life of Ray Charles.  The movie was cool because I learned so much I did not know.  I have listened to a little Ray Charles, as most people have.  I enjoy his innovative R & B and Gospel Sound.  One of the qualities the film promotes well, something I had known, is the excellent versatility and range of styles Charles could play.

I really was not aware how much of how much a junkie and drug abuser the singer really was.  The film really did a great job in capturing the severe faults of the artist as well as capturing the ways he overcame his obstacles.  All of the acting was superb, and Jamie Fox really really shines, showing his amazing talent.  So much of film is pure junk but I no doubt feel this feature adds a lot to the life of Charles and the potential for films.

The actress who played Charles wife and mother also did excellent jobs, as well as the fellow who played Quincy Jones.  Even more could have been added but I also understand the reasons for editing for time.  I liked the scene at the end with the Georgia State Legislators.  Julian Bond is a punk though, too bad he has to be such a political hack.

2212739,5,B0007IF19K,"THE MUSIC SAYS IT ALL: RAY CHARLES

BRIEFLY STATED: GREAT MUSIC BY A MAN WHO LIVED [2-disk WS ed.]

Jammie Foxx is absolutely convincing and possesses the essence of the man, Ray Charles, as much as is possible in a biopic. A great deal about ""Ray"" that we may have been unaware of is exposed on the screen, for better or worse. However, no matter what is happening is his life, Ray's music just keeps getting better and better and more widely heard and appreciated. He transcended barriers of all kinds which with the aid of his perserverance, and personality which was all made possible by his priceless musical gift.

 -----*- AS GOOD A MUSIC VIDEO AS THERE IS *-----*

The biopic about a very special human being who created terrificlly popular, though demonized by some, American music that the entire world came to appreciate. If this film is nothing else, it is a moving emotional music video of the great music. Hpwever, the film is much more than that. ""Ray"" is about the struggle of Ray Charles, from early childhood blindness to the difficulty of coping with the pressures of his ambition and his desires. He also had to deal with being blind and black, as well as the exploitation that this lent itself too. There was also the personal toll on himself, which was considerable and included some of his self-indulgences and his convictions too.

All in all, ""Ray"" depicts that life was not easy for Ray Charles. Yet, he was able to have his music his own way, which of course was the root of his greatness. He had faults, but for the most part he confronted his demons, and kept himself from becoming a tragic figure. In the end, he was winner in every way, and his music will live on forever as will the example he set. He aimed high, and he reached that goal, and then he cleaned-up his act on a personal level, which is very much to his credit.

ABOUT THE DVD: 2-DISK WIDESCREEN EDITION

DVD Features: I like the film so well, that I went through every single feature, including 'extended play', and 'commentary' the very first day I got the DVD set. I can just say that every feature is worthwhile and very concise, but I found myself wishing for more, especially in the area of the life of Ray himself.

-*- Available Subtitles: Spanish, French -*- Available Audio Tracks: English, French

Commentary by: director Taylor Hackford

Original theatrical version and extended version of film with 14 deleted scenes not shown in theaters [I preferred the extended version, but it is a little disjointed when it switches to deleted scenes]

""Walking in his Shoes"" Featurette [tells how Jamie Foxx auditioned for the role and had to play the piano blind and meet Ray of course, who did approve of Jamie]

""Ray Remembered"" Featurette [much too short - but well done]

Theatrical Trailer

9 additional complete and uncut musical performances [these are incredible music videos]

""Soul Mates"" featurette

""A Filmmakers Journey""

Academy Special - ""The Women of Ray""

""Ray: An American Story"" Booklet -interesting but again not enough!

BOTTOM LINE: I WAS AFRAID ""RAY"" WOULD BE A TRAGIC FILM - IT WASN'T - IT WAS INSPIRATIONAL!

The music video that ""Ray"" is steeped in alone, makes this film very well worth watching. But there's more, much more to ""Ray"", chiefly due to Jamie Foxx's inspired performance which lifted the entire cast, and thereby the film, to do it all better.

Jamie Foxx and every other actor on this film did very well. This film is very touching and at some points very sad. Again, I applaud Foxx in his excellent portrayal he is Ray in this film. You feel his joys and also all of his pain. I can see how this film won an Academy Award. I was born and have lived in Georgia all my life and I'm proud that his song is our state song.

2212742,5,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx gives a moving performance channeling the tortured soul of Ray Charles, who passed away in 2004. Foxx gives insight into the life of Ray Charles as he tours the country and becomes one of the most innovative voices ever heard in America. Not only do we see his success, but we also see the roots of Ray's inner demons, the death of his brother that he blames on himself, and his promise to his mother that he ""wouldn't let anybody turn him into no cripple."" His mother told him that just because he was blind, he wasn't stupid. We see these demons come out in Ray's startling addiction to heroin and women. Ray falls into the life of the star, shooting up all the time, and cheating on his wife even more. Ray finds he needs her as his only support in tough times. The genius of Ray is the performance given by Foxx. From the musical performances that are eerily similar to Charles, to the startlingly real example of Charles's detox, Foxx is dead on.

The rest of the supporting cast is good, with an excellent Regina Washington as Ray's wife. All in all, this movie gives viewers a deeper delve into the things that haunted Ray, and how he overcame them to become the great singing sensation who produced ""What'd I Say"", ""Georgia on My Mind"", and ""Hit the Road"". Foxx deserves nothing less than an Oscar nomination, as this performance is the best I've seen in years. The film haunts the audience as we witness Ray finaly lifting the blame off his shoulders for what happened to his brother, and his mother helps him to quit heroin.",1143244800,,1545,4.4787234042553195

2212746,5,B0007IF19K,"It's said Hollywood is the one place where they truly believe ""practice makes perfect"". That's because, whenever somebody stumbles over a format that works, everyone else keeps doing it over and over, milking it down to the last cent.

The recent swell of bio-pics like Walk The Line and Capote can be traced in part to the immense and deserved popularity of Ray. The version I saw included extended ""director's cut"" scenes which could be viewed on demand. They are highly recommended. These scenes add depth and texture to personal demons that plagued Charles. Overall the movie is remarkably accurate and fair, and provides great insight into a larger than life genius and musical innovator.

Ray's portrayal of the early days is particularly interesting, tiny clubs, being paid in ones, the splendid independence and confidence, so much the product of his mother's insistence he be prepared for blindness when it arrived. That the movie stops before wretched musical excesses of the late career is an all-around blessing. But here is the problem.

Foxx did deserve the Oscar, especially for the way he recreated movement, mannerisms, and physical style. He made a newly dead Charles return to life in our minds. But was the Academy rewarding Foxx, or Charles? Ray Charles was a universally loved icon. All Foxx had to do was slip into his suit and immediately he became interesting, sympathetic, and talented - because he was Ray Charles. By achieving his re-creation goal so completely, Foxx drew attention away from the movie's failure, a complete lack of originality.

The creative process involves delivering something that wasn't there before you arrived. The triumph of Ray, as good as it is, is that it delivers something that was already there, the personal and musical legacy of Ray Charles, and doesn't injure it too badly in the process. That Hollywood today relies so heavily on breathing life into recently deceased celebrities for its financial grist succinctly demonstrates its creative bankruptcy and cannibalistic tendencies.",1141257600,,2045,5.169184290030212
2212747,5,B0007IF19K,"There isn't much new to add to all the praise that has been heaped on this movie, all of it richly deserved. Jamie Foxx of course received an Oscar in 2004 for best male actor for his portrayal of Ray Charles. The acting by practically everyone is flawless; the soundtrack, made up of Ray Charles himself singing, is even better.

Born in poverty in rural Georgia, banned from the state for years and finally given the recognition there he deserved, Mr. Charles is a beautiful example of what people can overcome.

The film makes no attempt to whitewash the singer's life and does not shy away from either his drug addiction or his marital infidelities. It was heartening to read on the screen, just before the final credits rolled, that Mr. Charles for the next forty years after the period of his life that this movie covers, had his act together and continued to record one beautiful song after another for a grateful public.

2212758,5,B0007IF19K,"A couple of things I'd like to point out about this film:

=Ray Charles' struggles with heroin, and the effect it had on his personality and those who loved him, is legendary.  In one opportunity to see him and his orchestra perform in New York that I unfortunately had to miss years ago, a friend of mine said you could hear him almost cursing out his band members from several rows away while playing on stage--this I can only assume long after he kicked the heroin habit for good.  The fact that Taylor Hackford chose not to sugarcoat a considerable portion of this attests to not just his respect for his craft, but also to his incredible respect for this legend that was and is Ray Charles.

His touch--literally and figuratively--with women was also magnificently captured, as well as the grief and angst it caused his long suffering but deeply loving--and very smart--wife, who had a better idea of what she was getting into than any woman outside of the circle of such experience could probably understand.

His long standing friendship with the genius Quincy Jones was also well symbolized, as was their mutual evolutions as men and artists.

All of this is so important because, given the context of the breadth of his genius and his unimaginable level of courage, one would otherwise forget that Ray Charles was actually human--partialy thanks to a performance by Jamie Foxx that at times leaves the level of brilliant and goes straight to downright eerie.

The cinematography for this movie was beautiful.  The ensemble cast of actors were incredible--especially Ray's mother, who has this as her first movie role.  The costumes were thrilling; a fact easy to forget considering how well they made you forget you weren't actually in the concert halls and joints where it is taking place.  The screenplay was wonderfully dramatic without being preachy or documentary-like in a sneeky way.

You walk away from this movie in awe of Ray Charles...and then only sometime after you prepare to put this DVD away while reading the credits are you reminded that you were watching Jamie Foxx portraying Ray Charles.

You will want to own this one.",1138492800,,2149,4.857534246575343
2212759,4,B0007IF19K,"Everyone has a favorite scene and I have two favorites. Number one was when Ray (as a child) is newly blind and learning how to cope. He runs into his home and trips on a chair, hurting his toe. He cries out for his mother and she instinctively reaches out for him but thinks the better of it.

This wonderful young female actress shows, in body language and facial expression alone, the full range of emotion and pain and angst a mother would feel in similar circumstances. She forces herself to simply leave the young child to his own devices during this moment of extreme pain and need; to let him learn how to comfort himself.

She grapples with every maternal cell in her body to not run toward the child and scoop him up in her arms and kiss away the hurt. She loved him enough to force him to become independent. To me, that's the pivotal point in this story. Ray's life was hard but he was richly blessed with a mother whose wisdom and sagacity far exceeded her youthful age.

Okay Californians - the really, really cool trivia and my second favorite scene: When Ray is escorting his new girlfriend home, they're walking along a tree-lined street in California. The street is filled with 1920s bungalows. At 49 minutes and 49 seconds into the DVD (49:49), they walk past a little white house with a centered front porch and three windows on either side of that front porch. That house is a kit home from Pacific Ready Cut Homes of Los Angeles, a company that (like Sears) sold entire kit homes through mail order.

Neat, huh?

Great movie. I recommend it. Only reason I gave it four stars instead of five; I thought it focused too much on the drug use and womanizing.

2212761,5,B0007IF19K,"Look...I am so sick and tired of reading reviews from self-proclaimed professional movie critics who think they know it all and that they speak for everyone who hasn't seen the movie.  Although there were many glowing reviews for Jamie Foxx, deservingly by the way, across the board...many reviewers had less than flattering remarks for the filmmakers and the length of the movie.  I've seen the movie twice now and I have made mental ""ignore his/her future reviews"" notes about those ""critics"" who had less than stellar opinions for the film, because they obviously don't know what they are talking about.  And the Academy apparently agrees with me.  This film is exceptional, people...exceptional.  First of all, the film is cinematically breathtaking and well-photographed and it should have been nominated for cinematography.  The acting is nothing short of superb, with Jamie Foxx worthy of every ounce of the Oscar-winning performance he garnered.  Sure, the movie is long but you shouldn't notice as the story is well-crafted and unsparingly honest and unbiased in its protrayal of the imperfect title character.  And despite his drug use and abhorrent womanizing, Ray Charles' genius and humanity is apparent and well-depicted.  His musical icon status is not soiled upon and for me, I actually gained a greater appreciation for his contributions and his opening the door for all those that followed in his footsteps.  I loved the movie and recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone and everyone.  It's movie-film-making at its best and worthy of an addition to any notable movie collection.",1137196800,,1595,5.24015748031496
2212762,3,B0007IF19K,"This movie does an excellent job of clarifying Ray Charles' business arrangements and partnerships. Other than that, there is virtually no depth to any of the characters in the movie whatsoever, which is a crying shame because there were so many strong characters who had significant roles in Ray Charles' life and who more than deserve a closer look. I felt the movie's motive was more to clear Ray Charles' name in any of the dubious matters in his life, to shape the way Ray Charles will be remembered (which, incidentally, is exactly what Milan Kundera describes in his book, Immortality...). The movie is trying to ensure that Ray will be remembered in a positive way, while still maintaining his family's privacy, spinning a positive tone on all of his bad deeds (ie. yes, he was a drug addict, but he kicked the habit; yes, he had an illegitimate son, but he paid his dues in child support, etc.) Instead of throwing a flattering light on the man, it has an opposite effect on me. Perhaps, this movie should not have been completed so soon after his death. Time is needed for tears to be shed and old wounds to heal before the truth can be revealed.

What little that was portrayed of his personal life were outstandingly performed by the actors who played his mother, wife, mistress and Ray as a child - which is a shame because they did an outstanding job and the reason for my 3 star rating. The actress who portrayed Ray's mother did an amazing performance and if anybody deserved an award, it should have been her. Yes, Jamie Foxx did an outstanding job replicating Ray Charles' outside appearances and all the tics of his behavior, however we all know very well what and how Ray Charles looked like, being that he only just recently passed away. There was very little effort in showing the core essence of the man, which is no fault of Foxx.

An alright movie portraying a very glossy depiction of Ray Charles' life, with special attention in setting the record straight with his business deals and associations, and little effort in revealing who Ray Charles the man is and anyone else in his life.",1135728000,,2112,4.629333333333333
2212763,5,B0007IF19K,"Doing a music film biography can be a pretty tricky thing to pull off. They can either turn out to be triumphs such as ""Whats Love Got to With It"" (the amazing survival story of singer, Tina Turner) or total artistic stink-bombs like Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" (60's rocker, Jim Morrison). Thankfully, Taylor Hackford's Academy Award winning film, ""Ray"", the story of legendary soul singer/musician, Ray Charles, belongs in the former catagory. In fact it's probably one of the best music biographies ever made. The film follows Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) from his childhood in abject poverty to his rise in musical fame & fortune. In his childhood he sees his younger brother accidentally drown (which haunts him) and shortly after he goes blind from glaucoma. Charles' strong willed mother, Della (Kerry Washington) teaches him with ""tough love"" (""I aint gonna be around forever, so you better learn to do it yourself"") to stand on his own two feet and survive in this world. Charles takes the lessons to heart. He has an affinity for music. We follow him on a personally messy but artistically successful, life long trip, that takes him from the juke joints of the segregated, deep rural South to the most famous concert stages of the world. I think one of the reasons this film is so successful is because it presents us with the portrait of a truely conflicted man, who almost has a dual personality. On one hand it shows Ray Charles the ""musical genuis"" of both the stage and the studio. Here was a man who wore the word ""genuis"" like a crown. This was not just hype. The film shows, that he was a musical innovator (meshing gospel & blues together to create his own unique R&B style) consumate professional, a perfectionist and a tough taskmaster, who had high expectations for the musicians, that worked for him. On the other hand, the movie also presents a man with an equally messy personal life, that included heroin addiction, marital problems and numerous sexual affairs. It presents a conflicted man, who had lived a very tough life, with many personal demons, but who eventually perservered. Director Taylor Hackford does a fantastic job of telling this story in a wonderfully dynamic fashion, that keeps the viewer wanting more. But the real key for the artistic success of this film has got to be the mesmorizing, title role performance from Actor, Jamie Foxx. Foxx dosn't just merely mimic or do a slick impersonation (although he does a great job in that respect). Instead its almost as if he becomes Ray Charles himself and reveals in his performance, what the essence of the man was. This truely was the best acting performance of 2004 and Foxx roundly deserved his 'Best Actor' Oscar. Other very good performances from the film included Kerry Washington as Charles' no-nonsense mother, Sharon Warren as his first wife Aretha and Curtis Armstrong as Atlantic Records owner/producer, Ahmet Ertegun. Finally, mention should be made of the wonderfully faithful recreations of Ray Charles' legendary live shows. You really feel like your at one of his concerts. The filmmaker wisely chose to use Ray Charles' original recordings for the soundtrack and Jamie Foxx to lip-synch to. Wise choice, because only Ray Charles could make sounds like that. I wasn't much of a Ray Charles fan before I saw this movie, but I came out of the theatre tapping my toes and humming the tunes.

I don't feel like I gained deep insight into Ray Charles because the movie rolled out cliches and distorted the truth. For example, a scene strongly suggests Ray Charles wrote ""Hit the Road Jack"" during a spat with one of his women. But Percy Mayfield wrote it. The movie lacked a focus, and seemed to end abruptly. It gave a big wet kiss to the record companies, glossing over conflicts that surely must have been there concerning money paid out to artists. Maybe Ray left Atlantic on the rosiest of terms, but it seemed like the movie went to great lengths to tout how wonderful and progressive Atlantic Records was. It's a shame the movie is being taken as gospel when, judging by other reviews I've read, there are other skewed ""facts"" and glaring omissions. It's a pity such a rich subject matter should have been wasted, especially when the producers seemed to have a big budget for the movie. There is no excuse for the poor editing and storytelling. Ray's accomplishments despite being blind, his conquering of addiction, his stands on civil rights are compelling topics that need not have relied on cheap tricks and cliches to pack emotional punch.

The soundtrack, obviously, rocks, and there is some good acting, but it cannot compensate for a lackluster script. Probably worth seeing for the music alone, though.",1133222400,,1457,4.781746031746032

From childhood to fame and fortune, we watch Ray Charles go through struggles and adictions in his life that most of us never knew he endured. Touching, heart wrenching, warm and funny.

But also his way with his family, his other women, the role of his mother, his love of music and also his drug addiction.

The main reason to see this movie is the role that Jamie Foxx played, who got an oscar for this. He looks so much like him that it almost is scary. You really get the feeling you are looking at  Ray and not Jamie Foxx playing Ray.

2212769,5,B0007IF19K,"I saw this movie several months ago and I must say that I was very impressed by it, for many reasons. All the actors and actresses delivered outstanding performances, but especially the one by Jamie Foxx who went above and beyond the call. I can see what all the fuss is about in regards to his performance because he truly shines as one of the greatest legends in music history. Ray Charles was blessed with his gift for music while Foxx was blessed with both acting and singing, talents which he pours his heart and soul into in this film, much like Ray did throughout his career.

The tale weaved in this biography was very moving and seemed rather authentic. His drug addiction was somewhat romantisized I suppose, but at least the audience was given a taste of what it might have been like, a peak into the troubled times, the blues, of the musical genious.

The setting, the cinematography, the costumes, the music and the people really helped bring this amazing tale to life, something which can be rather challenging given the long and tumultuous life that Ray Charles led. Even though the movie did not cover his entire career, it portrayed the most significant parts in an enlightening way, effectively pointing out what made Ray what he was, a soulful, incredibly talented genious who had a passion for music, life and women.

I'd wager to say that Ray Charles' music can move me like no other musician can because it touches my soul, there's just something unique about his voice that brings out that emotion deep within a person, and that's what made Ray one of the greatest.  His music comes to life in this heartwarming tale.

I really like this movie because it manages to accomplish that rare feat of capturing a little bit of that magic that Ray was blessed with, and something that special doesn't come along every day.

His drug use was there and played a huge role in how he grew and to the man that he became. His affairs and wommanizing, despite being married and having children, is right in front of the viewer. The ability to show the beauty of Ray's music alongside his life, both good and bad, is why this movie is so good.

I must say as well that the music is key to making this movie so great, which isn't a surprise considering who Ray was.

Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a lifetime.  He may never get a role like this again, and if not, who cares?  He will always have this.  The story spans most of Ray Charles' life up to the point where the state of Georgia officially apologized to him for banning him from playing in their borders due to his cancellation of a huge concert because it was segregated.

Flashing back to scenes of his childhood, he grew up in a poor working community of blacks in the south.  He took interest in piano as a small boy and was taught by a man in his neighborhood.  Moving swiftly the plot and story shows how he traveled to Seattle and made a name for himself in the blues scene. As he moved up, he encountered racism as well as discrimination for being blind.  Strangely more people seemed to shun him for his blindness rather than his race.

As he gained more popularity he struggled to find his `sound'.  He also married and went on the road making a lot of money.  As his wife kept his home and had his children, he toured the country as he slipped deeper into drug use, infidelity and increasingly haunting memories from his childhood where he witnessed his younger brother die and his sight slowly slip away at an early age.

The story climaxes with his own realization of what his life had become.  Despite his fame and fortune, his drug use and torturing memories were taking their toll.  Salvation comes the hard way.  Despite it's two and half hour running time, Director Taylor Hackford makes sure the movie moves at a steady pace, never getting too slow or bogging itself down in intellectual over thinking of what the character is feeling.  Emotions are displayed and expressed, giving real tangibility to the story.

2212777,3,B0007IF19K,"1. Ray Charles was a once-in-a-lifetime talent.

2. Jamie Foxx does a great imitation of Ray Charles.

3. ""Ray"" is entertaining, but mostly superficial and sometimes silly.

I wanted to love this movie, but except for the incredible soundtrack and Foxx's eerie Ray-ness, ""Ray"" might as well have been a Sunday night network bio-drama. And for all his world-class mimicry, Foxx fails to give life to Charles. Mostly, though, that's the screenplay's fault and not Foxx's. (Check out Tom Hulce's Mozart in the Milos Forman/Peter Shaffer film of ""Amadeus"" if you want to feel the pain and glory of musical genius.)

The overall feel of ""Ray"" calls to mind nothing so much as ABC's sixties retrospective family show, American Dreams. Not surprisingly, my kids really enjoyed ""Ray""; it's easy on the eyes, and there's a comfortable TV-ness about it. Even when Charles is cheating on his wife or shooting up, it's all fairly upbeat; there's a subliminal happy-ending sub-text in just about every frame, and ultimate redemption is pretty much baked into the script. When Charles' demons (and there are plenty) do pop up, they get whack-a-moled well before they can spoil your hand-clappin' fun. And in ""Ray"", blindness isn't just something to overcome; it's almost cool. Drugs, of course, aren't cool, even when they help the artist flower, and the movie's anti-drug message is clear. If you've got kids in the 11 to 15 range, ""Ray"" probably provides as good a reason to just say no as they're likely to get from any of those preachy school programs. The ceiling shots of Foxx squirming through night sweats almost made me want to give up Lipitor. Once Ray breaks the habit, of course, the good times roll yet again.

Parental caveat: you may have a tough time explaining that Ray Charles probably didn't compose ""Hit The Road, Jack"" aloud and on the fly as he was throwing his lover out the door.",1128124800,,1889,4.854037267080745

One of the top films of 2004, ""Ray"" is a stellar biopic that charts the life and career of one of the certified musical legends of the twentieth century.  Ray Charles was a man who battled bigotry, blindness and his own personal demons to find fame, fortune and a place in the history books as one of the world`s premier entertainers, leaving behind him a legacy of great music that is as powerful today as it was when he originally recorded it.

Structurally, the film takes a more or less conventional approach to its subject matter,  starting in 1948 when Charles (then known as Raymond Charles Robinson) headed out on his own to play in seedy, all-black nightclubs, and ending in 1979, on the day when the state of Georgia officially rescinded its ban on Charles and adopted ""Georgia on My Mind"" as its official state song.  Interspersed along the way are frequent flashbacks to Charles' childhood growing up poor and fatherless in rural Florida under the guiding hand of his hardworking, demanding and tough-as-nails mother, who, even after the tragic drowning of her youngest son and Ray's onset of blindness at age seven, never gave up instilling the basic values of perseverance and self-reliance into the young boy (what a contrast to Howard Hughes` mother in ""The Aviator,"" who taught her child to basically fear everything life could possible throw at him!).  Armed with this sense of independence and determination, which helped him to out-maneuver those who would exploit him, Charles eventually made his way to the top, even though, as is often the case with artists and performers, his personal life was often at odds with his success.  The film shows us the good along with the bad, not shying away from the womanizing and heroin addiction that often threatened to derail both his career and his marriage.  Writer James L White and director Taylor Hackford have a fine eye and ear for the period in which the film is set, as we see Charles struggling for recognition in a race-sensitive society, finally achieving crossover success in the 1960's, and even becoming the first major performer to defy Jim Crow laws in the segregated South.

In his superb, Oscar-winning performance, Jamie Foxx literally inhabits the role of Charles, capturing each of the singer's trademark movements and inflections with utmost accuracy and precision.  Yet his is no slavish re-creation of a well-known figure, but rather a full-bodied portrait of a flesh-and-blood human being whose genius and talent often took a back seat to his misdirected obsessions and passions.  The filmmakers have wisely opted to use Charles' own recordings rather than having either Foxx or someone else re-record them.  The entire cast is excellent, but special kudos go to Kerry Washington, Regina King and Sharon Warren as the three key women in Charles' life.

Old-fashioned in the very best sense, ""Ray,"" which was released in the same year that Ray Charles himself passed away, serves as a fitting tribute to a man whose life and talent inspired generations of music lovers past and present.",1128038400,,3082,4.961165048543689
2212799,4,B0007IF19K,"I have revised my judgment of Jamie Foxx as an actor since his earlier work thought he was really convincing as the late Ray Charles.

I am not jazz enthusiast and so did not know much about Ray Charles except perhaps his one or two of his songs. This movie opened my eyes to the possibilities that are available to people who are considered disabled. Take Ray Charles for instance, black, blind and poor. Had he become a beggar I doubt anyone would have blamed him, but thanks to his mother and much later his wife, he became one of the best known musicians in America.

This is an inspirational story about a flawed man. He had addictions - heroine and women, and many times overlooked those who loved him the most. But he overcame these obstacles as well and freed himself from the grips of heroine and (one would like to think since the movie doesn't tell us) from easy women.

Unfortunately, the pace of this movie is quite slow and so may not appeal to everyone. But if you don't mind slowing down, and getting introduced to some great music - this might just be right for you.",1126569600,,1083,4.405

2212803,4,B0007IF19K,"One thing I have to say about the movie about music legend Ray Charles: Jamie Foxx sure as hell portrayed him the best I ever seen, just looking at him, you forget Jamie's in the movie except for a few scenes.

Another: Ray Charles has a RICH BODY OF MUSIC! From jazz (which wasn't covered that much in the film to blues (either swing, gut-bucket or bump-n-grind), from rock & roll to pop, from country to standards, the man knew how to sing a song and play a piano and did both with feeling, grit and revelation. Ray Charles probably was never an activist or a politician or even a man who thought of himself as a renegade, but no one can deny that Ray Charles' WHOLE existence WAS and IS a revolution! Revolutionary for the way he made everyone look at music different.

He just didn't sing a jazz song, he is jazz, he didn't just sing the blues, he LIVED it (as is apparent from his book and the movie), he didn't sing a soul song (he's all full of soul), he didn't just sing a rock & roll song (his whole existence WAS rock & roll!), he didn't just sing country, he was the storyteller to people's lives, he didn't just sing a standard, he became the standard. No one has influenced many as much as Ray Charles Robinson has over the last 50 years of the 20th century and a few years into the new millennium.

Now onto the bad news: this movie just didn't cut it overall. Oh there were fine acting by both the lead actor and some of the leading ladies including several unknowns. For instance, Regina King deserves huge kudos for her role as legendary Raelette Margie Hendricks. Another woman who gets my appreciation is Sharon Warren who played Aretha Robinson, Ray's beloved mother. And last but not least Kerry Washington who played a convincing Della Bee Robinson (Charles' second wife) to the hilt. But the rest of the film and the male actors' roles were off.

For instance, they didn't discuss how Ray learned how to read and write music (through Brailie) and how he studied music through Chopin and Beethoven (though he did play a little of Beethoven in one of the spots of the film), how he played with a lot of bands and his first recorded material - all in Florida before a SIXTEEN-year-old Ray moved to Seattle to continue his professional career as a musician.

They had the brother death scene wrong also. In his book, Ray and his brother were playing when George falls in the tub. Ray of course thought he was playing at first but then realized how serious it was and he tried to pull him out of the water - but the boy was too heavy for Ray and he called out his mother. How come in the movie Ray just stood there and Aretha had to find out by herself? Is Taylor Hackford sure Ray approved of all of this? I'm sure because he was about to go to the Pearly Gates, he didn't care just as long as people remember who he was and what he did for people and the music industry.

Few more scenes that have me shaking my head is who is that woman who first guided Ray and his first trio, the McSon Trio? It was never explained, I don't think, from Ray's perspective. And who was that midget? Nevertheless, he moved on to form his own band and toured with Lowell Fulson. Both of them toured together. And it was around Lowell that Ray started to get noticed. When he moves to Atlantic Records after a stint with Swing Time Records, it takes him a few tries before he began the path where he transformed the music scene. Also, RAY AND QUINCY JONES were working together in the '50s. In the movie, it's like suddenly Quincy wanted to work with him - and the film had it in 1961 when he's perfoming in the Newport Jazz Festival though he was already performing there since the mid-'50s when he got really noticed.

Also Ray played alto sax a few times. It was never covered. And also the managers were a little confusing. I kept hearing Joe or Roy Adams' name all the time but didn't know anything about that Jeff dude but I guess people need to be more open about this. Anyway, the scenes that had me a little mystied, they made Ray's saxophone player and best friend David ""Fathead"" Newman seem like a heartless (least from the surface) and loudmouthed junkie when he was really more. When I heard Fathead was actually shyer than Ray, that's when I raised my fist. Another, where was the other woman that helped raise Ray while his mother was going through a lot of mess? Mary Jane?

And really, why did they have to lie about what happened when Ray refused to play at a segreated Georgia hall? In the movie (and in certain urban legend stories that came out afterwards), after Ray refused to play because the place was segregated, somehow Georgia banned him from playing. According to what I read on the net, Ray wasn't banned from Georgia at all! But he had to pay compensation for his actions. Nevertheless, he wasn't the first artist to refuse to play at segregated places. Do you remember Sam Cooke? The man demanded that both black and white audiences sit in front of him and not so apart. From Ray's view, he wanted the black audience closer to him rather than on top and while that sounds boring, hey, that's what happened. They (the filmmakers) blew it up to proportion (just check out the ending, what a travesty!).

And also, Ray never fully explained WHO or WHY got him into heroin. My guess is that David probably helped him get stoned and he learned on his own. The amazing fact is that when he was stoned and doped, he was making some of the greatest music ever made and he never missed a gig - astounding because most rock star junkies often will think of excuses why they can't go onstage and then later we find out that it was either crack or coke that kept him or her in there. Ray Charles never used an excuse. No matter if he was using during or not, Ray Charles made sure he was there for every studio gig (even if he was late) or rehearsal hall and just on time for a concert. And also astounding is that in 1966 he beat it cold turkey.

Now here's where the movie goes from confusing to downright Disney-appropriate: throughout this movie, Ray flashbacks to his upbringings and it's believed that the reason he fools around with other women, uses smack and dope, and lies to people close to him (his children, wife) is because he can't get over his brother's death. WHAT!?! Or that his mother's advice: ""don't be a cripple"" was what made him depressed. Now I'm sure Ray was depressed (a reason why people use drugs anyway), but Ray himself said that his brother's death never got him feeling sorry for himself, it was still painful to him but that wasn't what made him use it nor was it his mother (who he admitted after his death, he felt lonely and withdrawn until Aretha's old friend encouraged him to move on). No, Ray Charles kicked the habit because he knew it was destroying his life. I would think that he kicked it because he wanted to show people he was INDEED not a cripple. And one thing that is weird about it, Ray was still using recreational drugs: smoking weed and drinking gin after kicking heroin and defiantly told David Ritz ""what I do with my body is my business"". Now I understand that the last few scenes were for Hollywood value but the truth is stranger than fiction points it out to be.

Now that last scene was the real pisser: Julian Bond reads the speech during the Georgia State Legistature thing in 1979 when Ray's ""Georgia on My Mind"" was made into a state anthem (now that's just amazing), it says that Georgia offered him ""an apology""... what did the state had to apologize for if they didn't ban him? Ray was just sick of being at a place where he felt segregation was just stupid that he stopped performing there after probably the mid-'60s. I'm sure he still performed in Georgia after 1961. And also, why is Della still with him? Della in truth divorced Ray in 1976 because she couldn't take more of her husband's philandering. Ray had twelve children, why are just two shown?

Another thing wrong with the Georgia thing was there was NO protestors out there when Ray decided not to play there. From what I got, one protestor sent him a telegram, probably a thank you for ""sticking up to his guns"". Plus, Ray was probably there with one of his sons and we never got to see him perform ""Georgia On My Mind"" there (and there's actual footage of it that I saw in a special about Ray). So as I said, perfect acting part for Jamie Foxx but not-so-good movie if you term out the actual reality of what Ray did and done after the fact. Here's the real truth about Ray Charles Robinson in summary terms:

1.) Ray actually tried to save his brother from drowning and call on his mom, he did not just stand there and watch.

2.) Ray was a child prodigy much like Little Stevie Wonder but you'll never know that from the film considering the number of flashbacks that only show him playing for the hillbilly band.

3.) Ray was still a teen when he moved to Seattle to make a living.

4.) Ray met 14-year-old Quincy Jones at a nightclub and not a street corner.

5.) Ray had ""two"" mothers: his birth mom Aretha (whose death was the most painful thing in his life) and his father's ex, Mary Jane (by the way, what happened to his father?).

6.) Ray married two women - one for just a year, and the other (Della) for 22 years (1955-1977)

7.) Ray had three kids with Della and nine children with other women (most notably Margie's son).

8.) Ray didn't get on heroin because of traumatic things that happened in his childhood, he got on it because he wanted to see how it felt and when it got too bad, he quit cold turkey (the man knew how to stick to his word when things got hectic, i.e., his third arrest for heroin possession).

9.) Ray Charles continued to be a top concert draw and superstar after 1966.

10.) Ray was never banned in Georgia, no protestors picketed the concert, and only refused to play it because he wanted the black audience to come down to the audience and not be so on top.

Other than that, it does cover his musical talents, his great business savvy and his unique sense of himself walking and cavorting alone as a blind individual.

For a man who recorded the edgy ""What'd I Say"" almost by accident, his life was almost off the cliff - that's how edgy he was and he was definitely cutting-edge. What can be understood is that thankfully younger audiences will know who Ray Charles is for better or for worse. He had a great sense of bringing people together. And somewhere in Heaven, the angels are singing ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" with him. Rest in peace, Brother Ray. You're forever a genius!",1125100800,,10582,4.389994895354773
2212804,5,B0007IF19K,"I finally got around to watching this film, and I must say that it was quite amazing.  I learned a lot about Ray Charles' life that I wasn't aware of.  Ray made playing the piano and singing look so easy!  I have gained a newfound respect for him...I loved watching him just come up with lyrics off the top of his head.  The man was a musical genius, no doubt.

I found myself mesmerized by Jamie Foxx's ability to just become Ray...he did such a phenomenal job!  He surely deserved the Oscar win.  I loved the way the story flashed back and forth from the present to his childhood.  The woman who played his mother was so believable, and the kids playing Ray and George were amazing.  The scenes of his childhood were beautifully crafted...the brilliant colors of the red clay and the bottles hanging from the tree were just beautiful.  I wish the movie would have shown Ray's life from his rehab days til 2004...just to watch Ray's popularity grow even more would have been nice.

Overall I was very pleased with this movie.  The music was wonderful, and all the actors and actresses involved did an amazing job.  I definitely recommend this one!",1125100800,,1148,4.541463414634146
2212805,4,B0007IF19K,"Ray, starring Jamie Foxx, chronicles the life and career of Ray Charles, the legendary piano player and jazz/blues/country singer. Charles went blind from glaucoma when he was about seven years old, but the film illustrates how he overcame that obstacle, as well as many others, to forge a very successful career in show business. The movie also tells the story of Charles' triumph over drug addiction.

The film makes liberal use of Charles' recordings, and I found myself dancing around my living room during some of the band scenes! The music is truly so intoxicating that it's difficult to sit still. I also especially loved the flashbacks to Charles' rural childhood, and how all of those scenes seemed to be shot in such bright contrasting colors - the red clay of the earth, the bright green of the grass, the multi-hued bottle trees. It made sense to me that, remembering, Charles would recall the world in such color.

In addition, the period feel of the movie is carefully portrayed. Because all of the movie takes place before 1979 (and most of it takes place in the 50's and 60's), set designers, costumers, and props masters had their work cut out for them. All the visuals in this movie feel very authentic. These people did their homework.

Jamie Foxx won an Oscar for his performance as Charles, and it was definitely well-deserved. I really enjoyed the fact that this movie did not sugar-coat Charles' life. He was a philanderer, a drug addict, and (often) a neglectful husband. But he did love his family, and he was a musical genius. Foxx (and the script) did a wonderful job of rendering him as a whole, and somewhat flawed, character.

The performances of Kerry Washington (who plays Della Charles, Ray's wife) and Regina King (Margie Hendrix, who plays one of the Raylettes that Charles becomes romantically involved with) were both especially notable. I've seen Regina King in several other films, and I've always thought she was one of the most talented actresses around. She proves it in this film.",1124841600,,2023,4.855072463768116

Switching gears,  ""Ray"" had a good screenplay and was directed well because without that, Jamie Foxx would have been just another cookie cut-out of a fallen rock star. Even without knowing about Ray Charles and his legacy left behind, ""Ray""  is a movie that tells his story with style and grace.  It's a movie that's informative and entertaining, and for someone like me who did not grow up listening to Ray Charles, the generation gap was not an issue.

But after seeing the movie and at the end where Ray ""promised"" that he'll stay clean...and did, brings a whole different light of admiration for him. One of the things I remember about him most was when he played on a a few eps on The Nanny and how CUTE he was! I always loved his smile and I always loved on how he would sometimes laugh at his own one-liners he would make. Other than his voice, it's his smile that I'll miss the most. He's definately healed on the other side and I'm sure he's creating his own sold-out concerts there as well.
I just thought it was sad that his passing was over-shadowed with Reagan's passing (someone whom I also adored). Mr. Charles, you are not forgotten and you will never be as well. Thank you for your sacrifice and talents you shared to so many millions here. :)

And as for the movie itself, it was awesome. Jamie Foxx nailed the character right on the head and I couldn't think of another actor playing the legend Ray Charles than with Mr. Foxx. It's a long jump on Jamie's part from a talented comedian to performing such a serious performance. This movie is worth it and 10 times over that. Watch it! :)",1124496000,,1285,4.309917355371901
2212819,5,B0007IF19K,"The fabulous music, and a performance by Jamie Foxx that captures the essence of the complex character that was Ray Charles, override the flaws that may be found in this film. Ray's roots were in the abject poverty of his youth in Greenville, Florida, where he witnessed the drowning of his younger brother, and shortly afterward started to go blind at the age of 5. Many of the events from his childhood are told in flashbacks, and there is a magical scene where he learns to use his ears to replace his eyes, as his mother watches in silence. His life on the road, his many women, and his battle with heroin addiction are depicted, but it's the music that drove his life. Ray was a musical genius who also had an astute instinct for business, and for what songs to add to his repertoire, which often broke new ground and went against the advice of the record industry experts.

Every bit of praise and every award (including the Best Actor Oscar) for Jamie Foxx is justified. Though the soundtrack uses the original recordings dating as far back as the 1953 ""Mess Around,"" Foxx is obviously an accomplished pianist; the actor and his role are like a marriage made in heaven, and this film biography will surely become a classic. The others in the cast that surround him are excellent, with Sharon Warren as his mother, Regina King as Margie Hendricks, and Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun among the standouts.

Director Taylor Hackwood blends the flashbacks and nightmares from the past into the thread of the story in a cohesive manner, and one is never lost in the sequences, as can easily happen with that style of storytelling. The flaws in the film would be in some of the stereotypical characterizations, but they fade into the background quickly as the power of Ray the genius and Jamie the actor rivet out attention to the screen. ""Ray"" also received an Oscar for Best Sound, and nominations for Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Costume Design. The songs include: ""Mess Around,"" ""I Got a Woman,"" ""Night Time is the Right Time,"" ""What'd I Say,"" ""Georgia on My Mind,"" ""Hit the Road, Jack,"" ""Unchain My Heart,"" ""I Can't Stop Loving You,""  ""Born to Lose,"" and much more.

Ray Charles(Jamie Foxx) is undeniebly one of the greatest music legonds of all time.  He started off small time, then a man he considered like a brother to him Jeff Brown(Clifton Powell) helped him to try to get him a national superstar.  But even with his girlfriend who eventually became his wife, Della Bea, Robinson(Kerry Washington), and his newfound success, he couldn't escape his painful past, where he got more than blind. So he needed something to try to take the pain away.  Then one of his friends Fathead Newman(Bokeem Woodbine) gave him some evil in the needle.  What would become of a rising star that had a painful past, and alot of comming afflictions?

This movie does a excellent job of telling Ray Charles life throughout, all he went through, the life problems, the critisism, the past, and, of course, his music.  This movie served the genres of drama, thriller, and biography with a fully loaded punch.  I mean, after watching the film, I couldn't even remember if Jamie Foxx ever did comedy before.  And the supporting cast really added a backup punch as well.  The only funny part was where the girl in the studio told Ray""you wouldn't save me if my @$$ was on fire.""  And he said ""d@mn right I wouldn't.

Ray is unbalivable in a variety of ways, and shows how a blind man in a cold world gave the finger to all the odds, and rose to the heights of greatness. Jamie Foxx definitly deserved the award.  He proved he could do a role like this, and to me, he did a better job than Will Smith in Ali, Denzel Washington in Malcom X, and Samuel L. Jackson in Caoch Narter.  If Ray Charles, God rest his soul, could see this, I'm sure he'd be very proud to see his life reinacted in souch a spectacular way.

to watching it... I thought it was one of the better movies

I've seen this other with the exception of Million Dollar

Baby.  The acting was top notch. It wasn't just Jamie Foxx

either, as it was actually the entire cast.

I thought Ray's mother was second to Jamie, and Kerry Wash-

ington isn't far behind in 3rd place. I hope she makes it as

a big star in the next few years.. Anyway, I thought the

movie was well done. It didn't make it a complete feel good

movie as there are times when you love Ray, and other times

you want to hate him and lying cheating ways.

It's amazing how Ray is so innocent at the start, but the

fame and the attention obviousally became too much, and like

lots of other singers he just got trapped in that type of

life.

I didn't like the fact that movie seem to go for a while and

it seemed at the end it just kind of cut to the chase and

act as if his career died after the 60's, which obviousally

isn't true.... I guess I understand it alittle because the

movie ran 2 1/2 hours as it is, but I'd like for it to have

been finished to atleast the 90's or so.

I see the point of showing his tragic times but to not show the second part of his life, how he recovered from his addiction was so agenda  written that it was sad. I feel this was an incomplete movie. Ray was a great performer but he was also a piece of garbage in this movie. I hope someone out there will remake this movie and show all of Ray's outstanding career. He made mistakes and big ones, but he recovered and became a household name in Jazz and the Blues.

It should have been a better movie. I am very emotional when it comes to movies, which makes me love movies. I like to know that it had an affect on me and it did for a litte bit. After awhile I couldn't wait for it to end. I don't mind sad movies but there is a difference between sad and depressing movies. This movie was depressing!!! You can make it work if it's sad but depressing never works.

Do you want an average movie or are you striving for greatness?????

Jamie Foxx is Ray...He not only acts, he becomes and that makes the movie awesome.  But to me, the real talent is in Sharon Warren, the woman that plays Ray's mother.  Please give this woman work and get her an oscar...She deserves it!",1122940800,,372,4.426470588235294

And if you are a Ray Charles fan, you might be disappointed to learn it only follows his carrer from the late 40's to the early 60's, and along if it, they have his childhood, and just how he became blind. Jammie Foxx does a few of the songs, but pretty much of the Ray Charles songs, is taken from recordings that Ray Charles did, so they did this instead of other musical bigoraphies of singers, of when a person isn't known for singing, they bring in somebody to do the singing for that actor, like in the case of La Bamba, Lou Diamond Phillips did the speaking voice of Ritchie Valens, and Los Lobos did the sing, even through Valens was killed in a plane crash, in 59, Ray Charles played way best that, and even until this centurary, before he died on June 10th, 2004, just weeks before this film came out. When the film begins we see Ray Robinson (Jamie Foxx) waiting for a bus to Seattle, of where he is planning on becoming, a singer. And he is on his way to a tryout that a freind promised him, but when he takes the stage, the aduance thinks it is all a joke, until he starts singing. And right away he is discovered by a recording exctive, and before you know it, he is under contract, but once he gets tired of perfoming he mets a woman, and they get married, and they the marriages begins to get in trouble, and Ray Charles is on drugs. What is idmazing to think, that he could play piano, when he can't see, but he don't have to see to be able to play a musical instrument, I would be one of the male singers, just doing vocals, which you don't see much, because all the guys singers play a muscial instrument from a guitar to a piano.",1122249600,,2141,4.124401913875598

Jamie Foxx did a very good job but I found Don Cheadle to have done better. If you want to watch a true masterpiece, then watch Hotel Rwanda.

But, Ray is a good movie that everyone should see. It portrays Ray Charles's life and showed his many dark secrets. I never knew that he had been like that. He didn't save his brother from death, cheated on his wife, then on the lady who he was cheating with and used many drugs. The movie is hard to watch at times and Jamie Foxx's performance is amazing. It shows all of the downfalls of Ray Charles and his whole life. The movie is also very informative as it informs you on everything in his life. It's kind of like a documentary in a movie form. I find it to be worth a definite rent but I recommend Hotel Rwanda over it. Nevertheless, both are excellent movies, and the performances by Jamie Foxx and Don Cheadle are both remarquable.",1121644800,,1045,4.225
2212827,3,B0007IF19K,"I'll have to say I was pretty impressed by this movie.  I did not know Ray Charles story or even that his real last name was Robinson.  I was impressed with Jamie Fox's acumen in his portrayal of Ray Charles.  I thought at many times throughout the move that I was watching Ray Charles.

Even though he was a blind man he had many did facets in his life and the way that he lead it.  Throughout the story the movie flashes back to the days when he was a young child and could see.  The movie uses the flashback to give the reasons why he acts the way he does.

Everybody tried to take advantage of him from the money that he was paid having to get his pay in singles, the women who took advantage of him because of his talent especially that woman in the beginning in Seattle.  But once he was moving up he changed all that and became a very shrewd businessman.  He was the first to own his master recordings and got to write the music that he wanted in every category.

The movie showed his dual life; his use of heroin and his many women on the road with the dichotomy of his wife and his professionalism on stage.  He was able to keep it together but would not tolerate abuse from anyone else in his band.  He was trying to reach a level of excellence that no one else could achieve.

It took me a long time to realize who the executive from Atlantic records was or where I had seen him before.  I knew I recognized him but could not place him.  He played a great character role.

The reason I did not give this a higher rating was the DVD features are atrocious.  I started by watching the extended version of the DVD.  It goes along then it breaks in the middle of dialog sometimes and after the third time it became really annoying, I thought there was something wrong with my DVD.  In one part it begins repeating the same scene for take after take and you will think your DVD is stuck.  If you watch the extended version and then the deleted scenes you have already seen them.  It was very disappointing that there was nothing new in the deleted scenes.

So overall I thought it was a good movie but maybe you should wait for the next version of the DVD and maybe they will fix these problems.",1121385600,,2201,4.178147268408551

2212839,5,B0007IF19K,"Ray Charles is a myth and here he becomes a friend, a familiar, a human being. That's the first and best aspect of the film we have to emphasize. The music is marvellous and has been in our ears and heads for more than fifty years. The phenomenal mixing and blending of R&B, blues, gospel, country music and jazz turns Ray Charles into a unique prophet of our musical imagination and world, and that will remain true for at least fifty more years. But the film follows Ray Charles practically from his birth till his death. It shows how he got involved in many deep and fundamental social, cultural, musical and racial movements to change the world when necessary. It shows the personal problems he had to face and solve in order to last in his creativity and humanity, particularly his decision to drop heroin in one single weaning session. It shows how he was able to separate his family life from his professional life, and his wife was able to follow him along this line, so that these two lives never mixed, at least not entirely. But he had an admirable wife. It also shows the great changes that occurred in the USA over the last sixty years, the tremendous reduction of racism and segregation, even the important first steps on the road towards repentance and reparations. The road has not reached its destination yet, but it is coming closer. Finally this film shows the absolute blend of the whole life of a man, and every single moment will remain alive for him forever, and his creativity, here Ray's music. When a man creates something he has to invest every single fiber of his muscles and every single cell of his brain into it to make it his truest ever child. That is what Ray was able to do and he did it over and over again in his long professional life. His decision to refuse to perform in a segregated theater in Georgia and his subsequent ban from Georgia for life was a better thought and felt decision than many other decisions of his in his whole entire life, and yet it was taken on the spur of the moment. That is the sign of a great man and a great mind.

2212841,4,B0007IF19K,"Other reviewers have voiced concerns about the rapid recovery Charles makes from crippling heroin addiction. Indeed, after suffering through most of 2 hours worth of watching him shoot up again and again, he goes cold turkey and is done with the stuff in about 10 minutes. It's not the most realistic resolution.

Jamie Foxx does indeed give an almost surreal portrayal of Charles in terms of its dead-on accuracy. It's quite literally spooky. (In a ""making of"" bonus feature, Foxx recounts how he would be up all night learning songs so his hand movements would be right and of committing to ""be"" blind while shooting. They used makeup to cover over his eyes and he would work like that for up to 14 hours a day.) As a testament to it, Ray Robinson Junior (Charles' son) said he had to remind himself it was NOT his father at times.

As far as special features go, besides the making of featurette, there's a ""Remembering Ray"" feature where musicians including Tony Bennett, Quincy Jones, and Reba McIntire offer their praise for the R&B legend. Another ""Inside Ray"" feature is mostly the director touting the story of Charles' rags to riches ascendancy.

BOTTOM LINE:

If you're looking for a ""feel good"" movie, this is probably NOT it. The film shows Charles with all his flaws as a womanizer who got another woman pregnant while his wife stayed home from the road, nearly killed himself with heroin, and attacked bandmembers for frailties he himself was dealing with. (He fires a trumpet player for turning up high.)

What you get here is the tale of Charles' PERSONAL triumphs: over racism in the Jim Crow South, over blindness, over addiction, and over the strictures of the music business. That was good enough for me and all the great music was icing.",1119312000,,1759,4.754098360655738
2212842,3,B0007IF19K,"Ray Charles was a very talented man, theres no getting around that.  Jamie Foxx is a very talented man, theres no getting around that one either...but this movie was just not as good as it should have and could have been.  A bi-opic is tricky, you either have it or you don't.  There are many great ones (A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man & Finding Neverland) and then there are ones that fall short of the mark like 'Ray'.  It's not an understatment to say that Foxx's performance SAVED this movie from becoming critic foder, and there are MANY critics who agree, this movie is really nothing without it's star performer.  Ray's life is intriging all in its own, but Taylor Hackford does a terrible job of piecing it together.  It was choppy and felt out of place, like scenes were thrown together last minute without really thinking about where they should go...(Remember Alexander anyone?)  Kerry Washington does a good job as the supporting wife (we've had an outstanding amount of supporting ladies lately) and I feel she too deserved the oscar nod for supporting actress and was yet robbed.  Really, Ray Charles was not much of a role model.  It's commendable that he overcame his vices (namely drugs and sex) but that is where I felt the movie went wrong.  There was too much focus on secondary things throughout the film that when we get to the end we've exhasted all our time and have no time left to really show us how Ray overcame his obsticles.  We see Ray in a hospital bed trying to recover and we see him go through his withdrawls but it's so quick and before you know it, he's healed.  What I loved about movies like 'A Beautiful Mind' was that it showed how his problems effected those around him BUT it also showed us how he fought to overcome them, and how he succeded.  Ray shows us how he wasted everything and everyone he ever loved and then it just tells us that he overcame his problems by showing us newspaper clippings and such.  Poor choice on Hackfords part.  I give this movie a 3 1/2 stars because Foxx did outstanding.  I just feel bad that with all it's potential it fizzled come the conclution instead of going out with a bang like say 'Cinderella Man' was able to do.",1118966400,,2200,4.503778337531486

The film centers on Ray from the mid-1940's to 1971, interspersed with flashbacks of his childhood, not attempting to sanitize Ray's life. Taylor Hackford (""La Bamba"") is very meticulous in depicting the era covered in the film. The production values are excellent. GREAT performances from the entire cast, especially Mr. Foxx.

The DVD edition features two versions of this heartwarming biography: the theatrical cut and the Extended Edition, featuring 14 additional scenes not shown in theaters. Rated PG for thematic elements, depictions of drug addiction and some language.",1118707200,,829,5.52755905511811
2212844,4,B0007IF19K,"Taylor Hackford's ""Ray"" is one of the best musical biopics, and its core strength comes not from its appreciation of Ray Charles' music or from its command of Ray's life and times (which are definitive strengths, but are common in biopics).  Rather, the key strength of ""Ray"" is its willingness to show the gigantic flaws that haunted the beloved musical genius.

""Ray"" could have easily been a straight rags-to-riches story, where a young boy overcomes racial prejudice, abject poverty, and a little thing called blindness to become one of the world's most famous musicians.  After all, who doesn't love Ray Charles?  The man with the winning smile, irreverent soul, and the talent to make a Diet Pepsi jingle into a hit song could have easily been the subject of a sugary-sweet, sycophantic film.

""Ray"" is not one of those.  While Ray Robinson was born into poverty and grew into the role of Ray Charles, musical deity, he did so in spite of what can only be described as colossal selfishness.  ""Ray"" gives us the man who could be a beloved family man and husband when at home, but could be a womanizing heroin addict when ""on the road.""  It's refreshing to see a movie take such an unvarnished stance towards its hero.

Most revealing is Ray's first exposure to heroin.  Ray is still a bit player in a two-bit band, his blindness is being exploited (folks are stealing his money by falsely telling him the contract terms), and his bandmates refuse to let him tag along with the ladies because they don't want a blind man to cramp their style.  Nevertheless, Ray barges into a bathroom while his mates are shooting up and out of the blue demands, ""a taste.""

This love of heroin follows Ray for several years.  Ray cranks out hit after hit while on the stuff, and the movie really doesn't show Ray suffering from the drug (other than some nervous scratching and a painful stint in rehab).  Still, through Ray's wife we hear about the painful toll the drug is taking on his life, and the movie's treatment of the heroin is probably sufficient.

Another strong point of ""Ray"" is its willingness to show how revolutionary Ray truly was.  Virtually any movie set in the 50s and 60s will have a gratuitous scene of uptight white adults being offended by the ""new music"" - it's like shooting fish in a barrel, and is quite tired.  While ""Ray"" indeed has some of those scenes, ""Ray"" also reminds us that many in the black community were horrified at Ray's music because he had the gall to tweak gospel music into something ""dangerous.""  And that was the Devil's work.  This balance is refreshing.

Any fan of Ray Charles' music will be pleased with the selections from the soundtrack.  While anyone could surely come up with some personal favorites that weren't part of the movie, the high points are definitely met.  ""Ray"" brings to light one of the lesser known aspects of Ray Charles' career - he made a country music album while at the height of his career, risked career suicide to do it, and pulled off one of the best country albums ever made.  Truly, this man was a genius (although my favorite scene showing Ray's virtuosity is the scene where he apparently improvs his way into ""Baby It's Alright"").

Much has been made of Jamie Foxx's performance in the title role.  He won the Oscar, and deservedly so.  In fact, his performance in ""Ray"" is so solid that his other Oscar-nominated performance of the year, as the cab driver in ""Collateral,"" is easily overshadowed.  He won for the right performance.

""Ray"" is a must-see movie for fans of American music.  The man made so many contributions to American music and overcame so many obstacles, both external and self-inflicted, that it's hard to remember that Ray Charles was a real man, not a fictitious character.",1118620800,,3770,4.6955859969558595

2212847,2,B0007IF19K,"I was hugely surprised when I finally had the chance to watch this movie.  I was not expecting an epic, but with all the high praise, I was waiting for something more than what was shown.  I have been a fan of Ray Charles since I was young and saw him perform in California.  He is one singer whose music will always be in style and he gave great interviews.  So what happened to this movie?

The problem with the movie is the same with any characterization of a famous personality who is still so well known to the viewing public.  The movie cannot be done without paying strict attention to impersonating the subject to a tee.  But generally, when the effort is all in the impersonation then the acting suffers.  This was seen with Will Smith as Muhammad Ali.  He tried to get all the theatrics of Ali, but we learned nothing of Ali's character.

Compare Foxx or Smith's performances with say Henry Fonda in Young Mr. Lincoln.  Was Fonda's portrayal of Lincoln perfect?  Who knows, we have no idea how Lincoln sounded or moved.  However, the movie gave us a very interesting idea of what Lincoln may have been like.  And that is how it usually fares for movies of more recent celebrities.  The one exception I know of is Denzell Washington's Malcolm X, who was both lauded for his similarity to his subject and for his acting.

My comments are not necessarily a slight to Jamie Foxx or Will Smith, because the audience wouldn't tolerate a less than complete impersonation of someone with whom the public is already well acquainted.  But, impersonation does not equal great acting, or a great movie.  If not for the movie's music, I would have been completely put off.

Not only did Foxx not give a best male acting job of all movies for the year, but his was not the best male acting in the movie Ray.  C.J. Sanders, who played Ray Charles as a youth was much more effective and provocative with his acting.  With Sanders, I felt something strong for Ray Charles.

2212865,4,B0007IF19K,"At this point, it seems superfluous to say Jamie Foxx gives a brilliant, surprisingly nuanced performance as Ray Charles, as he not only mimics the singer's mannerisms flawlessly but also provides texture and depth to the pained man underneath. It's startling to see Foxx perform at the piano in that idiosyncratic spasmodic style that Charles had, as the actor very often becomes indistinguishable from the legend. In the private moments also depicted here, Foxx is amazingly perceptive about the troubled, hard-shelled, often nasty man Charles apparently was in real life. Hardly the image one remembers from the Pepsi commercials or his other frequent, sometimes ridiculous TV appearances...anyone remember he was in several episodes of ""The Nanny""?

But the movie is not about the deconstruction of Ray Charles. In fact, director/writer Taylor Hackford and co-writer James L. White have written a literate, often powerful screenplay that makes us understand the complexity behind Charles' genius and the reasons for his inner demons. The challenge is that in order to remain true to his life story, Hackford and White have overstuffed the movie with so many milestone moments that it becomes episodic and sometimes rather wearing, especially when it comes to the film's depiction of Charles' two-decade heroin addiction. The sight of Charles shooting up and denying his addiction becomes almost a repetitive plot device, as if to provide melodramatic filler between the triumphant moments when he conquers musical frontiers that initially meet with resistance. That's not to say there aren't strong, compelling moments, as there are many. Ironically, one of the most memorable has nothing to do with Foxx but depicts a moment in Charles' hardscrabble Georgia childhood when little Ray trips over a chair and screams for his mother. Wordlessly, he picks himself up and becomes attuned to the sounds around him, picking up a cricket and realizing his mother is right in front of him. It's a transcendent moment.

Hackford is not the most subtle of filmmakers (he made the over-the-top ""The Devil's Advocate"" among others), and unfortunately his exaggerated sense of melodrama creeps in now and then, in particular, the last section when he decides to go for a 1960's movie-style approach to drug rehabilitation and inserts a fantasy scene back to Charles' childhood that provides pat closure to his long-standing issues.  It's an oddly surreal Hollywood-style scene that I feel betrays the honesty of what was presented before. But sometimes Hackford's excessiveness works in his favor, as in the supposedly improvised way that classics like ""What'd I Say?"" and ""Hit the Road, Jack"" were composed. I also think he does an effective job in making racism an inherent part of the story, not just a pointed plot device, specifically in showing how much of the manipulation Charles experienced in his career was not at the hands of white promoters. The movie also highlights Charles' decision not to play an unsegregated venue in Georgia and revisits that decision in a coda that takes place years later.

Beyond Foxx, there is a gallery of superlative performances, especially by a trio of fine actresses. Kerry Washington is superb as Charles' wife Della Bea providing strength and tolerance in the face of her husband's drug addiction and constant adultery.  Regina King plays backup singer Margie Hendricks, Charles' on-the-road mistress, with her requisite sass but with a penetrating desperation. Best of all is Sharon Warren, who portrays Charles' proud mother Aretha in flashbacks that make you understand where Charles got his courage and unbridled fury. Also providing excellent support are C.J. Sanders as the young Ray, who witnesses his young brother's accidental drowning and faces his impending blindness, and Clifton Powell as Charles' right-hand man Jeff Brown. The more well-known figures are played gamely though less memorably by Larenz Tate as an ambitious, very young Quincy Jones; Curtis Armstrong as an overly measured Ahmet Ertegun; and Richard Schiff as an anxious Jerry Wexler. At 153 minutes, the movie is rather long, and because of its episodic nature, stops rather abruptly in 1966 when Charles' personal and private lives seem to gain equilibrium. Regardless, the wondrous Foxx elevates this film biopic into something quite extraordinary.

The two-disc DVD package has several extras worth noting. On the first disc, the chief addition is fourteen scenes deleted in the theatrical version that have been spliced into the version here and notated accordingly. Some provide interesting context to the story, though they sometimes slow the pacing, a problem coupled by the addition of dead pauses that hurt the overall quality of the viewing experience. All told, the extended version clocks in at a staggering 178 minutes. Taylor Hackford's commentary on the alternate audio track is informative but on the perfunctory side (I only wish Foxx could have added his perspective and can only dream what Charles could have contributed had he lived long enough to ""see"" the film's release.) On the second disc, those fourteen deleted scenes show up individually, and there are also three featurettes. The first is the obligatory making-of short, ""A Look Inside Ray"", which includes comments by the filmmakers and actors on making the film.  The next short, ""Walking in His Shoes"", is about the meeting between Foxx and Charles before his death and discusses how Foxx got under the skin of the character. The last, ""Ray Remembered"", is a quick tribute to the spirit of Charles by those who loved and admired him.",1116201600,,5633,5.245283018867925
2212866,5,B0007IF19K,"Most of us under sixty think of Ray Charles as a perpetually smiling, swaying, grayed old man wearing sunglasses, glued to the piano bench who mumbles out ""Georgia.""  What most do not realize is that Ray Charles had been performing since the 1940's until his death in 2004.  This film shows Ray as a vibrant young man and opens our eyes to a whole new world that many have never known, a world that includes segregation and the civil rights movement.  The movie spans from Ray's childhood up until around 1963.  Considering that Ray's career went on for forty years AFTER that is astounding.

Ray Charles was born in Albany, Georgia, in 1930.  Growing up in poverty in Florida during the Great Depression, he lost his little brother in a tragic accident that would haunt him the rest of his life.  Around age seven, he went blind from glaucoma.  Ray honed his knack for music at the state school for the blind and deaf.

Although a true genius and pioneer of jazz, R&B, and even country western, Ray (Jamie Foxx) was not a perfect human being by any means.  Ray had learned to be fiercely independent from his fiery and dedicated mother Aretha (Sharon Warren), who died when he was fifteen.  Yet he was dependent on a couple of demons - women and heroin.  These addictions had tragic consequences.  The fact that Bea, his long-suffering wife (Regina King), stood by him all those years is an example of the kind of chemistry and love this man inspired.

The movie reminds me so much of The Temptations (1998) as far as how the plot unfolds, that I would have given ""Ray"" four stars if it were not for Foxx's and Warren's performances.  Foxx won Best Male Leading Actor for his sublime performance of a legend and an icon.  Sharon Warren was so intense as Ray's mother.  With her visible biceps on a fragile frame, she embodied the plight of all African Americans during Jim Crow.  I want to see Warren again in a film.  She is absolutely amazing.

The movie has sexuality and drug use, but nothing too graphic.  There is no bad language.  All of the songs in the film are Ray's original recordings, lip-synched very well by Foxx and the backup girls.  When I heard that the songs would be lip-synched, I did not think I would enjoy it, but it works very well and was very entertaining.

The DVD has commentary by the director, and short readable bios of just about all the main and supporting actors in the film.  It is a little annoying to have to read the white font and keep scrolling endlessly through each bio.",1115856000,,2515,4.523281596452328
2212867,5,B0007IF19K,"At Twenty, I look back at my life and I see my life in pictures and more pictures. Ray Charles in contrast sees/saw only that part of his life where he could dream of something real and worth holding onto in pictures. Sadly, it takes him back to the deepest wound he ever suffered. The fact that the story and screenplay on this film made me feel Jamie Foxx is the real Ray Charles is alone for me to rank it high.

Ray Charles was a man of gritty belief in himself but somehow or somewhere he would run back into those days where he could see as a child. The haunt and absolute feeling of worthlessness he felt never really escaped him. What I gained from this film is that childhood memories last a lifetime but it's only the superhuman who get over those. Pardon my lack of faith in humanity.

There were two scenes that made me cry and not surprisingly both were from his sorrowful past. What was however quite amazing about Ray Charles was the lack of any self pity in him. It were the words of his mother that kept him going.

Please note, this film is not for short attention span dilletes. It's not for those seeking Spidermans preventing trains from colliding and neither for those who wish to have a good time. It's one I'd recommend mostly to those who wish to look into another person's life. Jamie Foxx has gained a mountain load of appreciation for this role and deservedly so.

I think I'm gonna go watch more movies based on people's lives. I wouldn't consider buying Ray simply because it's not something I'd like to watch again.

Cheers & a Ray Charle smile..",1115769600,,1577,4.386986301369863
2212888,4,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"" is a better-than-good movie.  Unfortunatly it is merely better than most instead of great.  The acting is incredible as Mr. Foxx IS Ray Charles.  Showing his childhood in a series of flashbacks, as opposed to seeing it all at once at the beginning of the movie, was effective in keeping the viewer wanting more. The only knock against the film in my mind is the lack of theme.  What one thing does his life, in this film, teach us or make us feel? ""Work hard no matter your limits""? ""Treat your loving wife better than your mistress""?  ""Don't do drugs in Canada""? The last few minutes devolve into an ABC Afterschool Special.  Very interesting man.

Sharon Warren, who played Aretha Robinson(Ray's mother) touched my heart, I guess she should have got an oscar too!

2212890,5,B0007IF19K,"So often the biography films lack a certain something -- usually a message or central theme (other than the person).  This movie reminds me of Pollack in being about a very talented person with some personal issues that cause problems for the people in his life.  Ray Charles, as portrayed brilliantly in this movie by Jaime Foxx, was incredibly talented, but he was kind of a jerk in some ways, particularly his womanizing.  What the film doesn't mention is that he actually had 12 children, 1 from his first wife and 3 by his second wife, both marriages ending in divorce.

In my opinion, a more interesting story line involves Ray's mother, who died when Ray was a teenager (after a difficult life, as portrayed in this film).  You get her story ""between the lines"" as the film flashes back on Ray's difficult childhood -- a childhood so poor that it is miraculous that he survived and was able to accomplish so much, thanks to his strong as iron mother.

I highly recommend this film -- I could easily imagine watching it again and again.",1115078400,,1042,4.605405405405405
2212891,5,B0007IF19K,"Director Taylor Hackford parlayed a biography of one of the most uniquely talented singers of the post-World War Two era alongside a commanding performance by Jamie Foxx to propel ""Ray"" beyond the ranks of the traditional biopic into much more, a soul searching reflection of a great performer seeking to overcome the temptations of stardom and overcome an affliction that threatens to kill him.

In the case of musical legend Ray Charles, the superstar that Foxx plays with total conviction and unflagging energy, temptations along with the road to stardom was all the more difficult due to the singer's blindness from youth.  One of the film's most inspiring scenes unfolds when Charles's mother, at the time he is going blind, tells him that she will be his eyes and give him instructions, but only once.  She reasons that this is the way life operates; you get one chance and after that you are on your own.  This is the philosophy she repeatedly drives home when he is confronted with impending blindness.

Using extensive flashbacks, Hackford via Jimmy White's script directs us from Charles's early roots growing up poor in rural North Florida to the pivotal period when he seeks to make his mark in music.  One city where he receives an opportunity to be heard is Seattle, where he meets a young Quincy Jones and they explore the local musical world together.

Another important element of the film is the exploration of how Charles fought back when those around him sought to take advantage of his blindness.  He learned through experience to question the process of counting out bills in payment for his musical services after having been taken advantage of by dishonest music promoters.

Foxx's greatest challenge, which was surmounted with believability, was getting across the tortured side of Charles resulting from his addiction to drugs.  The painful process in which, by film's end, he has thrown off the monkey from his back, is handled deftly with Foxx never going over the edge or underplaying.  The sweating and trembling appear real and one can feel the pain emanating from Foxx as he transports us into the tortured world of a man under the influence of drugs.

The compelling performance of Foxx as a man under the influence of drugs is reminiscent of the brilliant effort of Ray Milland as a man addicted to alcohol in the sober and hard-hitting Billy Wilder 1945 drama, ""The Lost Weekend,"" for which the British actor, like Foxx six decades later, was rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar.  The arresting performance of Foxx was reminiscent of Milland's in that, in each case, we can feel the pain of the burdened individual overcome by a potentially deadly affliction.

Another area where ""Ray"" pulls no punches is in the presentation of the temptations Charles confronts when he moves into the superstar ranks.  While his loyal wife stays home and takes care of their son Charles engages in affairs with singers who perform with him, including one who has his child.

Charles's vital link to the rapidly developing civil rights movement of the sixties is also dramatically presented.  One scene presents Charles at his most admirable when he refuses to cross a picket line and perform before a segregated audience.  Pressures are brought against him afterwards by furious music promoters, including the one on whom Charles walked out, but he admirably refuses to back down even when his career existence is threatened, confident that he is standing on the right side of history.

""Ray"" is a film with heart and soul that, through Foxx's dominant performance, gives us a fascinating look into the life of a genuine performing genius.",1114732800,,3656,4.944444444444445

2212893,2,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx does an excellent impersonation of Ray Charles, but that's only good for about 20 minutes worth of entertainment. The movie goes on long after the novelty wears off, retelling events sequentially with the occasional childhood flashback. Who would've thought a musical legend's life could be so boring? Well, ok, I guess you wouldn't call philandering and drug addiction boring, but watching it repeatedly is another story. Occasionally a caption pops up telling you what year it is (and you really do feel it's been a year since the last one). Then it ends abruptly, almost as if someone said, ""Whoo-boy, this sure getting long. We'd better just stop here.""

As for the story, Ray Charles is not portrayed in a very sympathetic light. Early on he says, ""Don't feel sorry for me because I'm blind."" Not only did I not feel sorry for him, I actually started to like him less because of his callous behavior toward others. He eventually does defeat his demons, but then what? Then the movie's over, that's what.

Instead of a quick blurb about the final four decades of his life, maybe we could've been shown how he matured during that time. Did he regret having treated those close to him so shabbily? Did he do anything to make amends, where possible? Was he able to mend his relationships with his wife and kids? Too many questions were left hanging--and those were the things that might have helped me to understand him better as a person. I guess a lot could be inferred from the ending, but then so could most of the repetition of his seamier activities, which were dwelled upon so heavily. I found the whole thing overrated and disappointing.

By the way, the extended version with added scenes was very poorly done. There was no effort whatsoever to be selective or to blend the addional footage in seamlesslely--it was disruptive to the movie's flow, adding to the overall feeling of disjointedness. At one point there are actually four different ""takes"" of a brief scene, one after the other; it was disturbing and almost comical.

It took a long time to get this movie made, and Palm Springs is partly responsible for its success.  Alise Benjamin and the owners of the Cinemas Palme D'Or in Palm Desert, CA invested in Taylor Hackford's vision.  Thanks to the success of this movie indie movie fans in Palm Desert can ""Ohhh...ohhh..."" over other great movies.  As Ray says, ""Man, you told me if I think pennies, I get pennies. I'm thinking dollars, man.""

I voted for ""Ray"" or ""The Aviator"" to win over ""Million Dollar Baby.""  No disrespect to Clint of course.  But ""Ray"" offered the pursuit of a dream despite obstacles, and added music rather than boxing, with a terrific empowerment message for everyone but especially the African-American community.  I love this exchange between young Ray and his mother:

Aretha Robinson: Somebody'll fetch you when the bus gets to St. Augustine. When your there, show'em this.

Aretha Robinson: Tell them your name is Ray Charles Robinson.
Aretha Robinson: An' the sandwiches I made, don't eat them all at once... ya hear me?
Young Ray Robinson: [starting to cry] Mama... please don't make me go away. I'll keep up with the normal kids. I'll be good, just like George.
Aretha Robinson: This got nothin' to do with George... I've taken you as far as I can, baby. The teachers at St. Augustine know things I can't teach you. An' you need an education in this world.
Young Ray Robinson: I don't want no education!
Aretha Robinson: Shh! don't say that!
Young Ray Robinson: I don't! I wanna stay here with you!
Aretha Robinson: Stop it, Ray! I won't have you livin' hand to mouth like me, you hear?

Aretha Robinson: Now... If you wanna do something to make Mama proud, promise me you'll never let nobody turn you into no cripple... You won't become no charity case. An' you will *always* stand on your own two feet.
Young Ray Robinson: I promise.
Aretha Robinson: I love you baby... I'm so proud of you.

2212908,5,B0007IF19K,"Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Ray is a captivating and inspiring true story about a man beloved by millions around the world. Based on the life and times of Ray Charles Robinson, the film follows the popular singer's life from the earliest days of his youth to the day of his triumph over a heroin addiction. Featuring a soundtrack second to none in the history of cinema, Ray is the total package in terms of a blockbuster film - great characters blended together with an inspirational personal journey and an unforgettable musical score. Actor Jamie Foxx gives an Oscar Award winning performance so lifelike that it's difficult to distinguish his character from the real Ray Charles. In short, Ray is a film that appeals to a wide audience and one that literally transports its viewers into another era...

Jamie Foxx plays the role of Ray Charles Robinson, a black youth growing up in Florida during the Great Depression. Forced to deal with the tragedy of his kid brother's death, and the loss of his own vision at a young age, Ray nevertheless triumphs over his disability when his mother refuses to let him feel sorry for himself. Learning to play the piano from a neighborhood musician, Ray strikes out on his own in the late-1940s for gig in Seattle.

Ray's amazing talents are instantly recognized, and he's never short of a gig. However, while traveling on the road with several jazz bands, Ray begins using drugs, and he eventually becomes addicted to heroin. When Atlantic Records buys Ray's contract, Ray's career accelerates, culminating in several number one hits. Eventually, Ray strikes a deal with NBC worth more than any other performer of his day, and he and his wife Bea buy a luxurious Beverly Hills home with the world spread out before them.

But things aren't as perfect as they seem. Ray's infidelities have taken a toll on his marriage, and his drug addiction threatens to ruin his family, his relationship with his children, and his dealings with longtime friends. Having already accomplished more than most men, Ray Charles must now face the greatest challenge of his life - overcoming his heroin addiction and living a clean life...

Jamie Foxx is simply astounding in his portrayal of the larger than life figure Ray Charles, and his effort was more than acknowledged by his Academy Award victory and widespread critical acclaim. But less attention is given to the outstanding supporting cast that surrounds Foxx. The role of the young Ray Robinson's mother, Aretha, is played by Sharon Warren with such passion that her character leaps off the screen and into one's memory as the second most influential character of the film. Aretha's dedication to her son's future and her demanding, yet loving, attitude toward his self-sufficiency are admirable qualities. And the mother's influence on Ray is apparent in his drive not to be treated by the world as a cripple.

Further adding to the allure of Ray are performances by Kerry Washington (Della Bea Robinson), Regina King (Margie Hendricks), and Clifton Powell (Jeff Brown). Through the interaction of each character, the viewer sees a reflection of the passion and driving life forces that moved Ray Charles toward his musical destiny. Ultimately, Ray is a film about relationships and dreams. The astounding heights of success achieved by a blind man (and a black man in a segregated society) leave the impression that any individual can achieve any feat to which he puts his mind. This is the true gift of Ray, a feel-good film with a happy ending about a man who showed the world that anything is possible. And that's why Ray is an absolute must-see movie...

Movie by itself= mediocre

Jamie Foxx= OH MY GOD!!! HE'S SO FRIGGIN' AWESOME!!

These reviewers weren't too far from the truth. The movie probably won't stand the test of time, but it's one I'm glad I saw. I definitely felt its best picture nomination was uncalled for, especially since more worthy movies such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were ignored.

I got bored about a third of the way through it, and decided to go take a shower, while my family continued watching it. When I was finished and came back to resume viewing, I followed the story perfectly. This proves one thing: It was very, very long and it had too many extraneous parts. A good film, in my definition, will grip you until the very end where the emotion hits you like a cement wall. Shall I bring up the example again of Eternal Sunshine? THAT'S a good movie, if I should say so myself!

I've long been a fan of Ray's music, but knew very little about the man, and herein discovered the many sides to his character. A devoutly religious man, he was also a heroin addict who suffered with habitual infidelity, and many a bad decision along his road to fame and fortune. Many have noted the connection between his drug addiction and his lyrical talents, but the movie delves deeper into how Music was not only his salvation, but also a shield and an extension of his inner self that helped him try to overcome his blindness. Being a black man in racially segregated 1948 America, and coming from very humble beginnings in Florida would have been hard enough; but carrying the disability of no sight also from aged 7 leaves one hardly being able to imagine the difficulties he overcame. The movie centers on the 50's and 60's predominantly, and the period detail and recreation are excellent, as is the supporting cast. Another review has mentioned how you forget that you are watching an actor, such is the strength of Foxx's portrayal, and that in itself is a mammoth task when dealing with any biopic, let alone a musical icon of Charles stature. Well deserving of the Oscar for best actor, Foxx undoubtedly carries the film. The music is great, and the selections chosen for the movie mirror perfectly the era shown before you.

2212915,5,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"" is the story of the life and career of singer/pianist Ray Charles, whose music crossed charts, cultures and generations of fans. This is a straightforward biopic, but it's a good one, driven by an impressive lead performance, bolstered by a talented supporting cast, and punctuated with great music. ""Ray"" follows Charles' professional progress and personal life from 1948, when he played with a jazz trio in Seattle that led to his first record contract, through his emerging career and success with Atlantic Records in the 1950s, to his move to ABC and international fame in the 1960s. Periodic flashbacks reveal the formative events of Charles' childhood in rural Florida, where he was raised by his poor but resolute mother who had the heartbreaking misfortune to lose one child and watch helplessly as the other went blind.

Before settling on a style -or styles- of his own, Ray Charles claimed he could mimic just about anybody. Jamie Foxx's performance would have done him proud. It doesn't just involve mimicry, of course; Foxx gets at Ray Charles' underlying ambitions, fears, and faults. But Ray Charles' mannerisms and voice are distinctive, and Foxx adopts them naturally. Blind since he was 7 years old, but never lacking in wit or ambition, Charles talked himself into opportunities that no one wanted to give him. I found it interesting that being blind put him at a disadvantage, not so much because he couldn't see, but because it caused an inordinate number of people to try to take advantage of him. Ray Charles had great talent and a sharp business sense that served him well. He navigated using his extraordinary hearing instead of a cane or guide dog. He was gutsy when he pioneered a rousing blend of gospel and blues, and then again when he gave the same fans a country & western album. He was that rare musician who could change genres, pursue his artistic impulses, and keep his audience. But the most courageous thing he ever did may have been early in his career: Touring with a band in strange cities, Ray Charles' blindness made him constantly dependent on people whom he couldn't trust. He used heroin to cope with the stress, which eventually became an impediment.

2212917,5,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx was remarkable in his alarmingly accurate portrayal of legendary musical genius Ray Charles, deservedly lip-syncing his way to an Oscar.  So powerful was his performance that is overshadowed some excellent acting performances.  Kerry Washington and Regina King playing respectively Charles' wife Della Bea and his girlfriend Margie were wonderful in their roles.  Clifton Powell playing his personal handler Jeff was excellent in a supporting role.

Taylor Hackford used a good combination of story telling and flashbacks to give us insight into the tumultuous life that Charles lead.  His hardscabble early life was engineered by his hard working and concerned single mom Aretha, played terrifically by newcomer Sharon Warren.  My only criticism of the plot was the blaming of his later life personal demons on the tragic drowning death of his younger brother George.

Charles overcame glaucoma related blindness at the age of 7.  At the urging of his mom, learned music and life skills at a school for the blind.  Taken advantage of due to his disability, his talent ultimately propelled him to musical stardom.  His music, touring on the road and bad peer influence lead him into a life of heroin addiction and promiscuity.  He eventually overcame his dependence on drugs and philandering ways.  With the help of his steadfast and loving wife Della Bea, he re-established a solid family life.

This powerful flick was a honest look into the celebrated life of a musical phenom complete with warts.  Charles himself approved of his portrayal having seen the film shortly prior to his death.",1112572800,,1603,5.186770428015564

2212929,4,B0007IF19K,"It was pretty much the talk of the town after the film came out. That Jamie Foxx, the star of Ray, would win the Oscar. And sure enough, he won it. It is quite a performance but looking at the rest of the film, there's parts where it just unravels slightly and looks like a better editor needed to be on.

Ray Robinson became blind at the age of 7 and had to grow up with not only a loving but kind of stern mother, he had to live with his brother's accidental drowning, since Ray froze and hesitated. He does become quite a piano player so we follow him as people take advantage a bit as he's in a club only to have the manager become his woman and have him being paid less than everyone else.

He starts to come onto his own when he starts to marry rhythm and blues with gospel music(with the not unexpected outcries from religious people) and meets Della, who ends up becoming his wife and mother to his children. However, he's quite a womanizer and has some other women on the road. Not to mention he starts a heroin addiction.

One thing that is quite a watch is seeing Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles. Many people say he's channeling the late legend, but personally it's almost like he becomes the guy a good portion of the time that it practically looks eerie. Kerry Washington is quite good as the wife but her character is a bit unbelievable: she knows her husband has an addiction and has strayed yet she stays with him and doesn't really have that commanding ""don't do that anymore"" that wives like to do with their husbands. Regina King has one of his mistresses and backup singers, well I never did like her in any movies. She always seems to come off as bitchy and needy for some reason.

The other issue I have is the dramatic license that tends to happen. Like the water scenes(you'll see what I mean). It seems a bit too over-the-top and too sappy, especially the rehab scene where he ""confronts"" his demons. Not to mention it's way too long.

As for the music, there's no denying Ray Charles's talent but I just couldn't get to liking his music. That one song he plays after he just sleeps with Della for the first time is good but the rest of it I couldn't get into it. However kudos for putting in my 3nd favorite Beethoven piece Moonlight Sonata(first being Fur Elise and then Ode to Joy).

It's way too long but watch it for the performance. He deserves that Oscar although he's by no means a flawless actor(he did do Booty Call after all).",1112400000,,2468,4.342733188720174
2212930,5,B0007IF19K,"I think that Ray Charles would have been pleased with the quality of this film about his life.  I understand he was involved in the project until shortly before his death.  No wonder Jamie Foxx did such a good job of depicting him.  He really did study the man and seemed to morph into him for the film.  It's not surprising he won an academy award for his performance.

From the very beginning I was drawn into Ray's story which I had expected to be maudlin.  It wasn't.  Yes, he became blind as a child.  And yes, he had a traumatic childhood experience before that in which his little brother drowned in a washtub.  Through his child's eyes, he didn't realize the seriousness of the accident and didn't make any move to save him.  This incident had to effect him for the rest of his life.

Ray's mother, however, wanted her little boy to be strong.  As he was going blind she refused to let him feel pity for himself.  Instead she taught him to cope with his blindness and even sent him off to a school for the blind in order to complete his education in becoming self sufficient.  And he certainly did become self-sufficient, traveling across the country by bus to find work in a club playing piano.  He was great.  And he was also exploited, especially because he was blind.  Eventually, he wised up and his career soared.

He married a sweet woman and started a family.  But she never traveled on the road with him.  And he soon became involved with a whole series of other women.  He also became a heroin addict and fought these demons for most of his life.

This is just the basic story.  How it was put together was what made this film glow.  The director wisely focused on Ray's courage and conflicts.  And, after a while, his being blind became only a part of this complex human being who we saw evolving on the screen.  What an extraordinary life this man had.  And what an extraordinary performance that Jamie Fox did.  The film was perfect.  I wouldn't change a word of it.  Highly recommended.",1112400000,,2008,4.436813186813187
2212931,3,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"" is a decent prestige picture with a piece of excellent, Academy Award-winning mimicry at its center. Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles. The honors are deserved.

But Foxx inhabits the late soul singer instead of interpreting him, making for scenes that approach documentary. But the performance sets a slightly distant emotional tone that renders every flourish from director Taylor Hackford as contrived or sentimental.

Some of them are - a drug rehabilitation sequence, for example, is faux art crap - but some of them probably wouldn't be if Foxx had approached the role with more humor. Though it touches on his flaws - heroin addiction, adultery - ""Ray"" so reveres the man and his struggle that the movie is less a celebratory trip than a two-and-a-half-hour life lesson.

It's kind of edifying. It's kind of a bore.

We watch Foxx bounce from gig to gig, town to town, signing to old recordings of Charles (they sound good but, again, distant, as if heard through a radio filter), getting hooked to smack, collecting mistresses, recalling with horror the death of his younger brother when Ray was boy himself. Kerry Washington and Ragina King play the two most prominent women in Ray's life, wife Della and mistress Margie Hendricks - the homemaker and the artist. One survives the turmoil of Ray's life and the other commits suicide; that juxtaposition alone allows one to see the duality of Ray Charles. The movie sees it, too, in a sobering kind of way, without the joy that accompanied many of Ray's best musical work.",1112313600,,1527,4.884169884169884

Jamie Fox's performance is bizarre in it's believability.  I felt like I was watching the real Ray Charles.  His oscar was well-deserved!

The Bad:

The movie only covered the first half of Ray Charles' life and didn't seem to have any other point other than to show that Ray Charles wrestled with personal demons and overcame his blindness to become successful in life.  I was disappointed that we learned almost nothing about who Ray Charles really was, especially in his later years.

The Ugly:

The movie is WAY, WAY, too long!  Three hours of little more than RC playing in clubs, doing heroine and hitting on women.  If you fast-forwarded past the middle third of the movie you wouldn't miss much.

Overall:

JF's performance makes the movie well worth watching.

I had no clue that Ray Charles had a drug problem early in his career, which, when I was watching the parts where Jamie was putting the drugs into his body, were some of the saddest parts of the movie.

2212938,5,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"", released in 2004, garnered much critical acclaim from the critics.  The quality of this film proves them all as well-deserved, earning seven Oscar nomination including Best Picture and winning two (Best Sound Mixing and Best Actor).  It stars Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell, and others.  This film portrays the life and times of legendary musician Ray Charles.  It shows how he changed music history through his songs, his piano, and his vocals.  Through a grueling work schedule, heroin addiction, multiple sex partners, racism, and blindness, he overcomes every life obsticle wonderfully.  Meanwhile, it portrays his struggling childhood.  These past images haunt him through the whole film, namely his brother's early death.  All of the shown glimpses show how he began his life journey where the film begins.

These scenes and events are written beautifully.  Between the two simultaneous timelines, the film flows smoothly.  It successfully distinguishes his music often played in whole and his personal life without any major distractions.  Therefore, this is not just a musician ""biopic"".  It's a drama.  Few other films have accomplished this difficult task to this magnitude (""Amedeus"", 1984).  This film gives Ray Charles the recognition he deserves as a musician and a person.  Led by director Taylor Hackford, the series of events remain entertaining, yet heartfelt in certain scenes.  Such quality proves that the fifteen years of struggling to create this film was worth the wait.  The emotional stance continually builds, leading to a powerful conclusion.

Words cannot describe Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.  His mannerisms and appearance resemble exactly Charles's, ranging the performances style to the reaction of excitement to the speaking tone to the heroin reaction.  Therefore, watching Foxx is just like watching Ray Charles.  This difficult task proved well researched since he never leaves his ""Ray Charles mode"".  Occassionally does a film feature an actor portraying a real-life figure maintain their preciseness.  Though the actual Charles sings in the film, he expresses his own musical passion through the film.  The crew couldn't have hired a better actor for this role.  This truly was the performance of 2004 and of his career.  His hard work before and during filming paid off.

Though Foxx's performance is the main showcase, the other actors also portray their roles beautifully.  Through drug addiction, heartbreak, financial struggle, and betrayal, the actors' talents take this film to further emotional stance.  Some supporting roles could have received an Oscar nomination without complaints from the critics, namely Kerry Washington and Regina King.

The costume design and the make-up are accurate to the mid-1900's styles.  Jamie Foxx's appearance amazingly resembles Ray Charles to the degree that viewers often difficulty distinguishing the two.  Many characters, especially the women, could be mistaken as actual 1950's footage because of the make-up, the wardrobes, and the hairstyles.  The costumes also resemble Charles's actual suits worn on stage.

Such overall film quality makes ""Ray"" unforgettable viewing experience.  The DVD is a great essential for any Ray Charles or Jamie Foxx fans as it will surely please its audiences for a long time.  Other material that film fans may like are Ray Charles's final album ""Genius Loves Company"" and the ""Ray"" Sountrack.",1111363200,,3448,5.462121212121212

Ray had a serious drug habit and was an unfaithful husband, yet his remarkable talent and determination helped him move from playing in smoky dives to elegant theatres, with numerous gold records and Grammy awards to his credit.

I had heard so much talk about Jamie Foxx's amazing performance I didn't think he could possibly be that good, but his performance was indeed astonishing.  He looks and acts so much like Ray Charles, that I forgot it was an actor playing a part.  Foxx absolutely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor.

On top of Foxx's performance, the movie serves as a very good view of a brilliant man (a genius, indeed) who faced the challenges of heroin dependency (much like most succesful jazz, blues and soul musicians in the bulk of the twentieth century). But most important, it presents him as he was able to overcome that. The power of his upbringing by his single mom cannot be overlooked: that woman left an indelible mark on Ray Charles Robinson, which accompanied him and urged him up and forward until his end.

This film, though, brings so much more to the viewer than what the media has presented.  Foxx played an incredible role, that of Ray Charles Robinson.  Foxx' uncanny ability to become Charles was evident from his introduction in his first scene.  The twitchy smile, the soft spoken way in which Charles spoke, the sway, the pigeoned toed swagger--Foxx had it all!

Charles' affliction and battle with heroin was portrayed powerfully throughout the course of the film, as was his triumphant defeat of the addiction.  His battle with his own conscious, manifested in the self-tortuous memories of seeing his younger brother drown in their mother's wash basin, is stirring and difficult to watch.  Overcoming racism, having women fawn over him (and his apparent addiction to the female gender as well!), and his breathtaking ability to move both white and black audiences was mesmorizing.

Charles defeated many personal deamons; Foxx shows us how he did it.

2212945,4,B0007IF19K,"Never having been a major Ray Charles fan, I did not really think much about whether I should go see this film. Did I really care about a musical genius who was a musical innovator and later a force against segregation (who also happened to be blind) struggled against inferior treatment (first because of his blindness, second because of his race)? Did I care that he succumbed to the same demons that afflict many entertainers (infidelity/womanizing and heavy drug use/addiction)? On the surface, no, none of this is particularly noteworthy. However, Ray Charles, for all his very human faults, loved, lived and breathed music and changed the face of music and was a pioneer in the music industry (both from the standpoint of being a shrewd, cutthroat businessman and from the standpoint of defying musical barriers and traditional lines between musical genres). He started out from humble beginnings but used his talents to climb from this ""station"" and used his hard won experience (being cheated, being treated differently because of his handicap and/or his race). He could easily have been defeated, but he had talent and drive and a shrewdness born of bitter experience and of being wronged one too many times. Unfortunately, his shrewdness crossed over into his indiscriminate choices in his personal life, but this does not appear to have affected his professional life in the least. He succeeded and thrived against all odds, making state of the art deals for himself, forging his own way in the business, doing what he wanted to do. Unfortunately, as this biopic, handled expertly in the hands of director Taylor Hackford, his music did come at a price for others. Charles's long-suffering wife and a long string of other jilted lovers suffered a great deal at his hands.

The truly remarkable part of this film is not only that it tells a story of such a gifted man who had a sense of self and a sense of what he wanted to do (that led to great success) but that it was possible to make a film that so exactly captured the essence of this man. Jamie Foxx was a revelation; his astounding likeness to Ray Charles (in appearance, mannerisms) created a deeply authentic feel, which made one forget they were watching someone else playing Charles. This WAS Ray Charles reincarnated in a sense. Personally I did not know Jamie Foxx had it in him; I knew he was talented as an actor but had no idea he possessed this kind of gravity and versatility. Having seen all the films for which actors were Oscar-nominated for their roles this year, Foxx unequivocally was the hands-down winner with very tough competition.

can now understand why Jamie Foxx won best actor. The role he had to

perform was both physically and emotionally challenging. What I found even more amazing is that I didn't once think 'this is Jamie Foxx and I wonder  what he is thinking,' during the whole movie.

Jamie as Ray was excellent. I also liked how at the end they showed clips of the real Ray Charles and some photographs. One of the things I couldn't help but think about during the movie was how strong Ray's mother was. She lost one son to a horrible, fatalaccident and then her other child went blind. I couldn't even begin to imagine what that was like. She had o act cruel so that Ray could learn how to defend himself, and she said to Ray 'Don't ever let anyone make you become a cripple.'

All of the other actors gave very strong performances as well. I especially loved Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun. For some reason I just thought that he was great to watch, although everyone was good. I didn't know a lotabout Ray but not only did I learn about Ray but I also learned about the time that he lived in. I thought it was so sad at the beginning of the movie, when Ray and the other African Americans had to sit at the back of the bus and how they had a sign with the word 'colored' on it.



I didn't realize how much Ray was so deeply into dope. It was really hard to watch the rehabilitation scenes. This is one of those parts in the movies where I felt the film should had been rated R. These scenes where very graphic and intense.

I hadn't known that Ray was friends with Quincy Jones or the fact that he had a mistress. I thought that was very sad. But I found it even more sad that his mistress O.D.'d and left behind their illegitimate son.

2212952,5,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx more than earned his recent Best Actor Oscar win with this brilliant portrayal of the one and only musical genius of Ray Charles.  Perhaps more than Denzel Washington as Malcolm X, Lawrence Fishburne as Ike Turner, Angela Bassett as Tina Turner, or Will Smith as Mohammed Ali...Foxx's performance made me forget that it was anyone other than Ray Charles himself on the silver screen.  To call it merely an ""impersonation"" is to belittle a skill that many actors can't pull off.  Watch ""Saturday Night Live"" for impersonations of famous people, but can any of those actors carry an entire film, causing the viewer to forget that its merely an impersonation and getting absorbed as though we are watching Ray Charles' life play out before our very eyes.

I read some critiques of this film suffering from the usual bio-pic pitfalls of what angle to present a famous person's life story and where to begin and end such a film.  This film does everything right in terms of how a bio-pic should be made and the creative license that convey a person's inner demons was well done in this film.  The flashback sequences were well done and weren't confusing, and they helped the viewer understand the underlying motives of a childhood tragedy and how it helped create the person Ray Charles came to be.

What I loved most was seeing just why Ray Charles was considered a genius, as he knew when to move on to bigger and greener pastures with an impeccable sense of timing and what he is owed.  He could easily have wasted years if not decades at the hands of some craven club owners in Seattle who knew they had a rare and profitable talent on their hands and weren't thinking in his best interest, but their own greed.  People might have thought they could pull things over a blind man's head, but he always got the last laugh.

That's not to say that he was a perfect man.  The scenes of implied heroin use were heartbreaking, but redemption comes in the end when an arrest and drug treatment forces him to face his demons once and for all to kick his habit.  The scenes of his going cold turkey should be a warning lesson to anyone considering using drugs without regard to aftereffects.  That Ray Charles kicked his habit cold turkey and never relapsed is another testament to his genius.

What got the most laughs and applause in theaters where I saw it, was when Ray Charles refused to perform in a segregated venue in Georgia, causing the state to ban him for life.  The irony of it all as we watch the film in 2004/2005 is that we know that his ""Georgia On My Mind"" is the official state song of our state and he was given the hero's welcome in the state capitol in 1979.

This film is an impressive tribute to one of the greatest musical geniuses of our time and worth seeing and owning in your personal dvd collection.  If you buy this dvd, you'll probably want the cd soundtracks as well...as the first thing I did after seeing this movie was running out to buy a greatest hits cd since I regrettably didn't have a single Ray Charles cd in my collection.  That'll change after seeing the movie.  Ray Charles' music is diverse enough for everyone to like at least some of his songs.",1110240000,,3194,4.523478260869565

When I finally saw the movie, I was very surprised.  Not only did I think the movie was very entertaining, but I thought (like many others) that Jamie Foxx did an excellent job as Ray Charles.  Throughout the movie, I become so involved with the story and the music that I really didn't associate Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles.  The music throughout the movie is the best part.  If you see the DVD on an enhanced sound system, you will not be disappointed.  The DVD also has some touching special features showing Jamie Foxx with Ray Charles rehearsing music at the keyboard.  The music of Ray Charles is really something special.  The movie did a great job of showing the story of how a blind kid from the South rose to become on of the most prominent music figures in American history.

2212957,4,B0007IF19K,"This movie will be remembered for a long time due to two factors. The first one is bringing the music by Ray Charles to the attention of the newer generations, allowing the genre to resurface in its popularity. The second is the outstanding performance of Jamie Foxx, who demonstrates that when you do something from your heart, things usually turn out right. And this is basically what this movie is about, a story that shows us the good and bad moments of one of the most renowned figures in music history, and how he had to follow his heart to liberate himself from the unforgiving clutch of drugs.

The director Taylor Hackford was lucky to wait fifteen years for the right actor to come along, but he also shows that he played an important role in the success of this movie. For example, the way in which he presents the different events in the life of Ray - jumping back and forth in time instead of using a linear sequence - helps the viewer understand better the motivations behind most of the artist's actions. Events like losing his brother, losing his sight, being preyed upon by others due to his blindness and meeting people that introduced him to the drug world affected how Ray Charles lived his life. Those that see him as a flawless man will have a tough time watching some of the scenes in this film. But if you understand that he was not perfect, but someone who learned to overcome adversity, you will likely be pleased with the final result.

Those that love the music of Ray Charles are in heaven with this movie, since it has a myriad of music segments (more than ninety), and one of the most amazing facts is that Foxx plays the piano himself in all of them! This is one of the factors that make his performance something special, but it is not the only one. The actor played the role blind; instead of wearing dark glasses and watching what he was doing, his eyes were shut together with silicone all through the day. I think this helped a lot in achieving a more believable performance, and his ability to imitate the way in which others talk helped a lot too. One thing is undisputable: Jamie Foxx received one of the most deserved Academy Awards of the last few years.",1109894400,,2196,4.4875
2212958,5,B0007IF19K,"I'm fortunate enough to have witnessed a large part of Ray Charles' career, and very fortunate to have seen him perform live in Las Vegas in 2000. At 70 years old, he was still just as captivating and electrifying as ever. He was a brilliant musician, and a brilliant performer, and contributed more to the field of music than many people realize. Truly a stellar name.

As such, when I heard of a movie about him, I figured they would hopefully do at least a fair job, but didn't think they'd ever truly capture him. I was wrong.

The casting of Jamie Foxx is either the luckiest act in the history of movies, or practically deserves an Oscar of its own. What in Foxx's background could possibly have hinted he could pull off a performance of this magnitude?

You've heard people say it -- you forget it isn't Ray up there on the screen. It's true. Frankly it's rather eerie at times. Foxx truly captures Ray -- the look, the mannerisms, everything. If this is truly the level of his ability, I look forward to more.

2212960,4,B0007IF19K,"The most heartfelt compliment I can give to Taylor Hackford's RAY is that it inspired me to seek out more of Ray Charles' music, and thus discover what a truly great and inspiring musician he was. You can only have the greatest respect for a man who dealt with his blindness and a childhood tragedy (the drowning death of his kid brother) by making great music and revolutionizing the sound of R&B in the process (his mixing of R&B with gospel sounds was scandalous at the time). And what versatility!---from early original hits like ""I've Got a Woman"" and ""What I'd Say,"" he eventually put his brilliant interpretive stamp on country music, which is where his classic rendition of ""Georgia on my Mind"" comes from. But, above all, Ray Charles' soulful voice was his calling card; very few musicians feel the words he sings quite the way Brother Ray did.

All of this comes through brilliantly in RAY, as does Charles' manipulative dark side: he ruthlessly switched labels when one couldn't match another's offer, and he had a tendency to coldly cast off friends as quickly as he made them. ""Music is a business, baby,"" Ray (Jamie Foxx) says in the movie, and he certainly treated it that way. And of course there was his drug addiction, which he eventually kicked cold turkey.

The achievement of RAY is that both Hackford and its star, Jamie Foxx, do not shy away from Ray Charles' less savory characteristics, but nevertheless do a good job of depicting the man and the impact he had on music. The only major flaw of the film is that at times it lapses into biopic cliches---especially the ending, which throws in a silly dream sequence that suggests that, only after he was able to move on from the terrible memory of his brother's drowning death was he able to cast off his demons, an explanation that, as most biopic explanations tend to be, seems much too pat. But what RAY gets right---how well it explains what a major impact his music had---is what makes this a cherishable movie.

Among its other achievements, RAY has also made me a believer of Jamie Foxx. Anyone who can pull off such a stunning portrayal of such a musical giant, and do it without a hint of vanity, deserves all the respect he gets. Foxx's performance is not so much an imitation as it is an inhabitation: he gets Ray's famous physical mannerisms right, but he also paints Ray as a flawed but spirited individual who, despite his attitude toward women and the business side of music, loved to perform and loved to live. As you watch the film, you barely feel Foxx there; he is so immersed in Ray Charles that he almost becomes the man (at least, until that silly concluding dream sequence, in which he has to take off his sunglasses and open his eyes). 2004 really was Foxx's year: he not only did justice to Ray Charles; he also nearly acted poor hard-working Tom Cruise off the screen in Michael Mann's COLLATERAL. He now has an Oscar to show for it, and one that is well-deserved.

RAY is not a great movie, but its good points far outweigh its lapses into conventional moralizing. Such a seminal musician as Ray Charles deserves a movie that touches at the heart of why he was so special, and RAY, more often than not, does that admirably.

The music is superb and the recording sessions and live performances come alive with a fly-on-the-wall authenticity. His heroin addiction though, seemed lacking in true dramatic depth but steeped in nobility as he requests no medicinal help during withdrawl and later we're told, as it is written on the screen, ""Ray Charles never did drugs again"". It's not enough to say so, the movie could have continued on showing Charles' basking in the reverence finally awarded him and living the drug-free climate he apparently earned.

2212964,3,B0007IF19K,"Any film adorned with the music of Ray Charles will fill audiences with excitement and awe, and any performance comparable to Jamie Foxx's depiction of Ray Charles warrants viewing. But other than those two elements, this theatrical version of Charles's life is not much better than what could be expected of a made-for-TV biopic of a man who broke conventions and genres and helped shape modern music.

""Ray"" follows the performer from his teenage beginnings through his thirties, climaxing on an important moment in Charles's life when he made a moral declaration. Like many artists, Ray Charles's youth haunted him for years. Once he became blind at seven, his mind replayed one of his last images (the death of his brother), and those constant visions drove the married Ray to dull his pain in the arms of other women and with the euphoric release gained from heroin.

But with those counter-productive outlets, Charles also escaped with his music. He immersed himself in the craft, building on an unexplainable gift for throwing different musical styles together and allowing them to instantly create new, exciting sounds. Sometimes country, sometimes blues, sometimes gospel...but always brilliant.

Maybe the virtuosity of his music and the strength of great acting performances is enough for a film, and if that is true, ""Ray"" works (because that's about all that is to be admired). 2004 will be the year of the biopic (Hughes, Kinsey, Alexander, Jesus, Berrie, etc), and many of these motion pictures could learn lessons from the great depictions of historical figures in past films. ""Ray"" makes the same mistake made by recent films based on Andy Kaufman, Muhammad Ali and others. These movies believe their subject matter's strength is all a film needs, ignoring the potential to use the lives of great individuals as a catapult for statements on important issues or to shed light on the human spirit (see films based on Larry Flynt, Jake LaMotta or Mozart).

""Ray"" fails to become anything more than an attractive telling of the life of an American icon. The immediate critical praise for this film will diminish in years, as the current reviews have no doubt been affected by the recent passing of Charles and the undeniable love for the man and his music by many (including myself). The criticism found here for the film should not be applied to the man or his music, just the lackluster manner in which both were presented on screen.",1109635200,,2448,4.97799511002445

Impossible to take one brilliant man's life and squeeze it into a two and a half hour cinematic spectacle, director Taylor Hackford did an amazing job with what he could conjure into our hearts and minds. Hackford's directing is superb. But beyond even that, one name continues to reasonate in the psyche: Jamie Foxx. Jamie Foxx becomes Ray Charles. This is no imitation. Foxx gets beneath Ray's skin and sinks inside a complicated, unpredictable but beautiful man and makes us feel Ray's joys, pains, angels, and demons. But his is not the only honorable performance in the movie, this movie wouldn't be half of what it is without the powerhouse performance of newcomer Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. The same way she haunts Ray's subconscious, she haunts the audience with her emotional and tough-as-nails portrayal of a poor black woman raising her two boys. Regina King is a fireball as the soulful Margie Hendrix, Ray's long-time mistress and Kerry Washington is remarkable as Ray's incredibly loyal wife. Outstanding performances make this movie so truly captivating. It may sound cliche, but it is a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled. You can't help but feel connected to the life of Ray Charles. He is a great historical figure who provided a soundtrack to the black experience by taking gospel and rhythm and blues and creating soul music, which expressed the existential love and pain of the black experience and it was revolutionary at that time and still revolutionary when you think about it today.

There is a powerful story to be told in Ray Charles life but more than that this movie connects with audiences due to the essence of the music combined with one really powerful and believable performance by Foxx.

What held this back from a five-star review is that the scenes in which Charles' Mom appears come across as too one-dimensional.  The acting between the lady playing Charles' mother and the children seemed forced and put-on.  It reminded me of a made-for-TV movie and too much was made of Ray's demons being tied to his early childhood experiences with the accidental death of his younger brother.  But don't let this minor detractor distract you from the powerfully told tale of a person overcoming seemingly overwhelming odds to make it in the world.

I've always appreciated the music of Ray Charles, but this film took me behind the scenes to experience the heartache and courage that fueled his soul.  Using flashbacks to perfection, the director allows us to feel the guilt of Ray's childhood, as well as the backbone that his mother fostered in him.

2212974,4,B0007IF19K,"I like ""Ray."" The music is strong, using Ray Charles' own tracks for both background and performance shots. The storyline is complex, flashing back to Charles' youth as he reflected on the loss of his eyesight and the death of his brother.

From his days as a child in a poor rural community, through his early days as an unknown musician struggling to get a fair deal, to his mid-career with management problems, affairs, hits, and drugs, and then, finally, as a one of our national heroes, we see Ray Charles in full color.

We learn how he manipulated women, cheated on his wife, became addicted to heroin, found his sound, got his name, and learned to work aggressively as his own musician. He deals with racism at first by avoiding it, and then quickly, takes a harsh stand, shaming the bigots and segregationists. Now, in a state where he was once banned from playing, his work, ""Georgia on My Mind"" is now the state song.

Biopics of celebrities are difficult to describe because of the chronology required to produce the movies. People don't live out plots written by screenwriters, but lives that have events that do not always make sense. Ray Charles' life didn't always make sense, but he lived it.

We have two views of Ray Charles. One is as a fighter, working hard against adversity to become the musician we now know. The other is as a womanizing addict who used his charm, position and trust of his wife to diminish all that was good about him. He eventually beats the drugs, holds onto his marriage, but these failures brought down my respect of him.

Jamie Foxx never impressed me before this. I found his comedy more off-color than I prefer, and expected that his version of Ray Charles would be mediocre. I heard the hype that his performance was Oscar-worthy, and watched the movie with the eyes of a skeptic. Now, I am impressed.

Jamie Foxx has a new fan. I hope he gets roles that allow him to shine like he does in ""Ray.""

The DVD for ""Ray"" adds to the movie. Normally, a DVD brings little extra that is interesting, but watching Jamie Foxx and Ray Charles interact was touching, as was hearing Foxx describe his experience in learning the role. We learn Foxx not only can play piano, but is trained at a high level. Those are his hands on the keys, and not movie magic. He respected Charles and the difficulty of playing an icon, and earned Charles' respect in the process.

2212975,5,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  That's what you would feel after watching Taylor Hackford's bio-pic of late Ray Charles.  Not only Foxx moves like Ray, with his characteristic, jerky body movements, but he represents the soul of the great musician himself.

Despite the long running time (more than 150 minutes), the film never shows lull, covering the life of Ray Charles from his childhood to the stardom.  Despite the too familiar ways of showing the psychological aspects of his life, the film is skillfully edited, and shows his genius as musician and strong will for success, both of which are no surprising matters.  Made with the artist's own  saction, the film is fairly honest about the negative sides of his personality -- about use of substance, womanizing habits, and dubious judgements influenced by money.  But they are also part of Ray.

[MUSIC] But the film's greatest strength lies in the interpretation of Ray Charles' music, or how his style came to be what it is.  It is easy for anyone to portray him as genius, but the director knows rightly that his talent lies in innovation -- fusing gospel music with rhythmn and blues.  And 'Ray' presents us the innovator's way of thinking, or inspiration, by cleverly putting his classic songs in the context of his own history.  How and where did he think of 'I Got a Woman'?  How did people (including his future wife) respond to it?  The music history is never so accurately and succinctly interpreted as in 'Ray.'

For all the hit songs like 'Georgia on My Mind' or 'I Can't Stop Loving You,' the film suggests that the culmination of Ray Charles's career is 'What'd I Say.'  The whole film is great, of course, but that scene showing the birth of that song (my favorite) alone deserves 5 star rating.  At that moment, the music gets irresistible.  From there, the film's latter half is slightly weak, for after all, Ray Charles sitting behind the executive's desk is much less attractive Ray Charles singing in a travelling band.

But all the actors, especially Jamie Foxx and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother are so memorable that you won't just stop watching it.  My only complaint is that Taylor Hackford should not have let Foxx take off the glasses at one scene -- you will know where -- in which he looks like not Ray, but Jamie Foxx, for he revels his own eyes.  You know, Foxx has eyes that remind us of puppy, and in that scene only he stops being Ray.

But for all its small flaws, 'Ray' will remain in your mind as a great tribute to Ray Charles and his music.  Watch and listen to it.",1109289600,,2557,4.610619469026549
2212976,4,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"" is a bit tough to review, but only because I absolutely loved Jamie Foxx's performance. Like Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings, and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, and Marlon Brando as The Godfather, you just can't picture anyone else playing Ray Charles other than Mr. Foxx. His acting was superlative, his knowledge of the material (Ray Charles himself), mind-boggling. It was worth the price of admission just to see how much he ""owned"" this role.

But one great actor does not a great movie make. I will give credit to the filming, cinematography, and the other minor characters in the film. The problem I had, though, was that I felt the psychological impact of Ray's childhood was forced upon me as the viewer. I felt like the screenwriters were saying, ""Okay, here we need to have the audience in tears"", and ""Here we need them to have empathy with Ray for his horrible childhood"". Because of this, the emotional impact on me was negligible.

I will say that I did learn a thing or two about Mr. Charles' life. For instance, I had no idea that he had such a horrible heroin addiction for so long. I remember reading about some of this in the papers years ago but I wasn't aware that it had started so early in his musical career, and how much it affected his life and music much later on.

And here's an interesting thing to me: I actually BOUGHT this film on DVD. Even with the flaws in the script, I just couldn't take my eyes off of Jamie Foxx's portrayal whenever he came on screen. He deserves the Best Actor award at the Oscars, and I'll bet dollars to donuts that he gets it, too.",1109203200,,1637,4.413907284768212

As ""Gladiator"" is with Russell Crowe, ""Top Gun"" is with Tom Cruise, and ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders"" is with Harrison Ford, ""Ray"" will be known as the film where Jamie Foxx made his mark. As good a performance as I have ever seen on a movie screen, bar none. Taylor Hackford's straightforward and purposeful direction is right on target. The pacing of the film couldn't be any better. Simply put, this is a masterpiece of a film, in an age where film excellence in very much on the wane.",1109116800,,499,4.434782608695652
2212978,4,B0007IF19K,"Incidentals: The packaging is classic, just black and white. Get used to hearing ""Georgia On My Mind"" for all of the background music for the menus on both DVDs. Now it's stuck in my head and I don't even like the song that much.

Extended edition: The cover advertised an additional 40 minutes of footage that wasn't in the theatrical release (which I saw a couple months ago).

IMO, they did a very poor job adding it in; it was the exact opposite of Lord of the Rings, where the additional footage was seamlessly added. Here, a little three-note logo would pop up, the movie would freeze for a second or two, then the extended scene would play, then another freeze and cut back to the original. After about three of these, my husband and I said ""Screw it, this is really annoying"" and went back and just watched the theatrical version.

The Movie: The movie itself is fantastic. I loved the early scenes of the rural South -- for me, personally, it was a treat to actually see a bottle tree. It doesn't flinch from showing the truth of those times: Jim Crow, the colored section of the Greyhound bus, segregated concerts, an illiterate woman trying to raise two boys by herself.

It doesn't flinch from showing the truth about the negative side of Ray Charles, either: the womanizing, the heroin, the paranoia (sometimes justified) that people were trying to scam him.

You also see his musical courage and genius, and his hard-earned business savvy. Some of his best-known songs are woven throughout the narrative, along with occasional flashbacks to Charles's traumatic childhood.

The Acting: What can I say about Jamie Foxx that hasn't already been said? You will believe he's Ray Charles. Yes, he's that good. There's an interview with Charles's son Ray Junior who said it was downright spooky; if he caught the light the right way, he thought he was looking at his father instead of Foxx.

Curtis Armstrong, who my generation knows as the sidekick from ""Risky Business"" and ""Better Off Dead"" and as Booger from ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" does an outstanding job of Atlantic Records exec Ahmet Ertegun.

I didn't know any of the other actors by name, but they all gave very convincing performances, especially the unknown who walked in off the street to portray Charles's mother, Aretha.

In fact, it seems to me that this is one of those perfect casts that happen when the stars align just so, and you get a ""Gone With the Wind"" or a ""Casablanca.""

The Extras: Here's where the special edition disappoints, surprisingly. There are five or six featurettes -- yes, they run together so I don't recall the exact number -- and they almost all use some of the same quotes over and over.

Each one has Taylor Hackford talking about it taking 15 years to make the film and how astounded he was to find out that Jamie Foxx could play piano.

Each one talks about the women in Ray Charles's life and how they were muses for him and what a strong influence his mother was on him -- how she taught him to be self-reliant and until the day he died he never used a cane or a seeing-eye dog.

Each one talks about how Hackford and Co. were really nervous the first time they sat down with Charles to show him the film in the making, until he said ""You got it, that's right.""

I would have much preferred they make two longish ""making of"" features instead of all these little ones that repeat themselves endlessly.

That said, there are some real gems in the extras, including footage of Jamie Foxx and Ray Charles meeting for the first time, and sitting down at keyboards beside each other so Charles could hear for himself what Foxx could do. They trade blues licks for awhile, and Foxx talks about how nervous he was, until Charles got up, threw an arm over his shoulder, and said, ""The boy's got it!""

There are interviews with Quincy Jones, Della Bea Robinson (former wife), and Ray Junior. You see how this was obviously a labor of love for many people involved in the project. It's a good behind-the-scenes look, even if it does repeat itself too much.

Overall Grade: B+. Loses points for the ham-handed way the additional footage is added, and for the repetitive extras. Pluses for honesty and kick-butt music.",1109116800,,4210,4.621983914209116

Don't get me wrong...it's a brilliant idea. A blind mans version of seeing shadows. I get it. I just didn't like the way it was interpreted onto film. I would have also liked to see a lot more on the subject of how he learned to play the piano when he was a child, and more story on how he dealt with being blind, rather than his drug usage and extensive love triangles.

Foxx's impersonation is a good one, but I've seen comics doing that blind musician head rolling thing forever.

While Charles' genius is emphasized and his boorishness to his wife, his mistresses and his managers is glossed over.

For too long the film dwells on the obvious, and in a didactic way it goes on and on about the evils of the segregated south and heroin addiction, and the decency of a loving mama and a long suffering wife.

Like a lot of performances detailing the character of real people, the actor puts a lot of time into the physical details and the ""character"" begins to look a little one dimensional--like most portraits (on canvas or film) tend to.

If you know nothing about Ray Charles, this film is really informative and quite touching.  It's touching given the fact that Ray Charles himself was closely involved in making sure that even the ugly truth was told.  It takes a certain courage to lay all that out in the cold light of public judgement...I had to admire that.

Unfortunately, the film is also too long...it could have benefited immensely from more creative editing.  Balancing that out, though, is the wonderful music of the Master.

I am grateful that the director allowed Ray Charles to have input in the film; and that although he had the rights to do this film for about 15 years, he waited for Jamie Foxx to play the part.  I just can't see anyone else doing it.  He will be associated with Ray Charles like Christopher Reeve is with Superman, forever.  Ray Charles invented a style of music from gospel and blues that no one thought possible.  And it can never be duplicated.

Overall, it's a very good biography about a man, as it turns out, I knew very little about.  I knew him only as an old man, a family man, and a music legend.  I didn't know about his younger days: his drug addiction to heroin, his philandering ways, and the careless manner in which he handled his family.  I didn't know that he had been born with sight and lost it at a young age, or that he had had such a strong determined mother.  It was very interesting to see what he went through on his way to stardom, from all the good things that happened to him to all the bad choices he made along the way.  Although I'm not sure if I would deem this movie ""Oscar-worthy,"" I readily admit that it was a moving film - and as I said before, a VERY good biography that shares with us plenty of Ray's music to enjoy along the way.  Jamie Foxx was fantastic - I never knew he could act that well!  This movie was a very good showing of his capabilities as an actor.  Please remember that it is a biography, so it is slow-moving - there is no action packed into it like there are in fictional movies.

Well, I'll say it again: Jamie Foxx is maddeningly good as Ray Charles. Not only does Foxx share an uncanny resemblance to Charles, he gets so deep inside the real Ray Charles, that the two breathe as one. He doesn't imitate Charles's traits and mannerisms: he adopts them as his own, and if there is any justice left (which I doubt) in the acedemy, they will grant Foxx his much deserved academy award for what will be known years from now as a landmark performance.

I'm not usually a fan of biopics. They strike me as insipid, superficial, and pretensious. But ""Ray"" really got to me. It actually told me the story of this legened in an engrossing manner-it was touching without being trite. Ray is a very long film, but it flew by. It is by turns humorous, tragic, and triumphant. Most of all, it successfully does what very few biopics are able to do-it conveys a clear essence of who this man was-Ray the man, not the star. More than that, all of the supporting characters in the film are believable and 3-dimensional.

Superb performances from the ENTIRE cast, and spine-tingling music from the genius himself can't hurt.

But what truly raises Ray to the bar of excellence is Foxx's UNBELIEVABLE performance. His acting alone makes this film worth seeing.",1108944000,,1384,4.710743801652892

Jamie Foxx's performance is a really good imitation of Ray Charles.  But this is not the great performance that critics are falling over themselves to praise.  Like Will Smith in ""Ali"", Foxx's ""depth"" is shown by having him be stoic while all around him better actors perform.
The basis of Ray Caharles' powerful inner demons are revealed through a series of flashbacks, but what the viewer is left with is a feeling that the guy is a basically irredeemable jerk who - for a decade and a half - produced great music.
The movie is way too long and Charles' treatment of those around him left me feeling cold towards him.  What remains is a series of laughably executed scenes (particularly weak is the montage of Ray's ""announcer"" and road manager introducing him in a variety of foreign languages).
Even with the length of ""Ray"", the story ends abruptly.  Ray Charles struggles to kick heroin and then lives happily ever after.  This despite the fact that Ray Charles spent the last 3 decades of his life touring as a ""golden oldie"" type act.
I don't understand the hype on this film.  It has the emotional depth of Tom Hanks' homage to the early 60's ""That Thing You Do"".  And that's no compliment.",1108944000,,1385,4.721991701244813
2212986,5,B0007IF19K,"Taylor Hackford is one of the most gifted and prominent directors of the American Cinema. He has given us previously authentic film jewels as Dolores Clairburne, Proof of life and The devils's advocate. So all the possible ephitets for this movie somehow weren't strange to me but confirmed once more my first imnpression of Hackford and his artistic talents.

The illumination before all is another hidden actor. Tastefully filmed the secure and masterful direction leads us through three decades. The artistic direction and the set up are impeccable. The film is told in documental stylish and thanks to the multiple flashback, the viewer ellaborates his own readings.

The supporting cast is simply superb. The lense never abuses of the close up. Hackford knows to use it as the good conductor with the ""rubato"" figure. In the other hand the script reflects to Ray multidimensionally , this a very remarkable aspect: Ray : the man and his whole circunstamce: many directors could have
given us a tearful reading and a soap melodram but you fortunately are before a mature film crudely described.

Jamie Fox,to my mind, makes an impressive acting and I suspect he will be the real winner the next Sunday in the Academy Award. Fox didn't play Ray Charles character. He simply is Ray , he lived the personae. Evcery little gesture, head movement and nervous tics in challenging and dramatic moments. From the first shot entering to that dark stage in the middle of nowhere in such bar, he asimilated the dramatis personae becoming instantaneously in a model not simply an actor in searc of Charles.

If Fox doesn't win this Award this risky prediction won't affect this towering performance at all because he just signed his name in the immortality.

Please go to the movie and acquire this artwork, because the only complaint I have is perhaps a certain lack of surronding atmosphere in the middle of the sixties with the dramatic facts as Martin Luther's King murder for instance and the raising of prominents artists who grew up under his shadow and influence such Stevie Wonder for instance.

We were all very impressed with the tremendous struggle that Charles had to maintain, with the discrimmination, especially in the south.  Even some Afro-Americans were taking advantage of this blind black man.  Not only was he a musical genius, but also a survivor!

I found it troubling how much Charles got caught in spider webs of drug abuse and unethical women, bound to get a hold of some of his fortune.  I was surprised that he had 12 children, many out of wedlock?  All an all, his life was success, because of the joy of music he brought to millions and millions around the globe.  I will never forget how Charles could deliver the song ""America""...how he could make me shed a tear every time he sang that great song.

Jamie Foxx does like two good movies and people are throwing their panties at him and praising him like he's the best actor ever! I personally think Leo DiCaprio should win the Oscar this year because his performance in 'The Aviator' was so good that it should not be passed up by some comedian.

One thing I would advise first-time DVD viewers: don't watch the extended version first. Those extra scenes are included in a ""deleted scenes"" section on the DVD and most were left out for good reason. I didn't do that, and there was a certain amount of coherence missing.  I've watched it a few times since, it's a wonderfully made film, which FINALLY earned Taylor Hackford a nomination as Best Director. I'm not going to go over the plot, or rehash the fact that this is a ""warts 'n all"" look at Charles' life. The acting is very fine; Foxx does it all, with excellent support from Kerry Washington (wife) and Regina King (mother). Ms. King, in particular, will bring a tear to your eye, a short but powerful display of fine acting. The Oscars are next week, and all indications are that Foxx will win the Oscar. His leading role in ""Collateral"" also garnered him a nomination, but...supporting? He'll definitely win something. Oscar odds-makers are suggesting that Foxx' performance in ""Ray"" was an impersonation. I think it went way beyond that, but who knows what goes through the minds of those idiots?

2212990,5,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx. Taylor Hackford. Ray Charles. Three powerhouse performances in one movie. This film was flawless. Rarely have I seen a film where nearly every actor gave a memorable performance. There are no wasted scenes in this film! What I found particularly interesting is that it shows what people can overcome when they make up their minds to do so. My favorite lines: You're blind not stupid! You're not a cripple! So many Americans could learn from this inspirational film. I loved it!

Jamie Foxx, who also gave an astonishing performance in Collateral opposite Tom Cruise earlier this year, was nothing short of brilliant in this career making film. Foxx has come a long way since his years on the comedy show, In Living Color. Of this, there is no doubt. While I knew it was Jamie Foxx on the screen, I saw Ray Charles. I don't know if Foxx will get another opportunity to shine the way he did in Ray. I think it's safe to say, GIVE THE OSCAR TO MR. FOXX RIGHT NOW. No need to wait!

I was first acquainted with Taylor Hackford in the summer of 1980 in a small California town called Victorville. I was there TDY (temporary duty) at George Air Force Base for 45 days. The hotel I was staying at was showing a film called, The Idol Maker, starring Ray Sharkey, known for his television role in the series Wise Guy opposite Ken Wahl. That film was directed by none other than Taylor Hackford who just two years later went on to direct one of my favorite military films, An Officer and a Gentlemen. Hackford also directed Against All Odds, Delores Claiborne, The Devil's Advocate, White Nights, and Proof of Life. Ray easily blows away all of these career building films. This is his best film to date! GIVE HIM THE BEST DIRECTOR OSCAR!

Ray Charles never sounded better in this biopic. The soundtrack is worth the price of admission. Georgia on my mind, What'd I Say, Hit The Road Jack, I Can't Stop Loving You, and many more are featured in this film.

Other notable performances were given by Kerry Washington, who played Della Bea Robinson and new comer, Sharon Warren, who played Aretha Robinson, mother of the late great Ray Charles. Hopefully, these two women will be nominated for best supporting Oscars along with Foxx and Hackford.

The problem, however is that Hollywood is known for not rewarding people when they've earned it. They tend to give Oscars when they want you to have it, which, I find extremely irritating. Having said that, I'll take mine whenever they give it to me! LOL!

Ray is a 5 star film.

2212991,5,B0007IF19K,"What can I say about this film that has not already been said?  Very little.  I agree with everyone who says that Jamie Foxx ""became"" Ray Charles.  I ""became"" Ray Charles just watching it.  It was an amazing performance.  At the end of it, I felt as though I knew Ray--I felt that he was one of my friends--I felt that I miss him now that he is gone.  The performance was that powerful.  I agree with everyone who says that the sets were dynamite.  The cars.  The clothes.  The hip-cat talk.  The brash Jim Crow.  They took us back, baby.  They took us back.  I agree with everyone who says that the music works in this movie better than in any musician's bio-pic ever, and that includes even the best of them like Buddy Holly, The Doors, Richy Valens, Sweet Dreams, Coal Miner's Daughter, the Countless Elvis attempts, and even the Oscar-winning Amadeus.  And there is a reason: focus.

Love it or hate it, focus makes the difference.  Yes, Ray's life was bigger than addiction, adultery, and adoration. Yes, this narrowness of focus leaves out much that is to be said about one of the musical greats of all time.  It does, however, make for an easier viewing.  It does allow for a man's life to be built around plotpoints, rather than feel like a confusing splash of film images--which is what usually happens in a bio-pic (take Van Peeble's ALI, for example).

So, if we focus on Ray's adultery, there is a natural beginning, middle and end when Marge Hendricks, his longtime lover, meets Ray, becomes entangled in his life and his music, and then dies tragically of an overdose (never mind the truth that Ray's dalliances neither began nor ended with Marge).

If we focus on the drugs, there is a natural beginning, middle and end when Ray is introduced to heroin, becomes a junky, and finally kicks the habit (never mind that the addiction seems to have coincided with the BEST music he ever created; in other words, most of the songs we love him for were all created during his junky days).

Finally, if we focus on the adoration (i.e., the music and the fan), we get the ""rhyme"" that matches the ""reason.""  In other words, Ray's music, fueled by his addiction and lust, is the perfect background music for . . . the movie RAY.  The driving rhythms of HIT THE ROAD JACK and UNCHAIN MY HEART are both heartstrong and drugged-out frenetic.

A final point: My second favorite Ray song of all time is THE NIGHTTIME IS THE RIGHT TIME (my all time favorite was left out of the film, LET'S GO GET STONED).  For about two decades I have associated that song, NIGHTTIME, with a classic episode of THE COSBY SHOW--you know the one I'm talking about: Cosby and family lip-sync a musical tribute to their grandparents before they go off on a sea voyage to renew their vows.  It is a sweet scene, highlighted by cute little Rudy (Keisha Knight Pulliam), five at the time, closing her eyes in a lover's mask and moaning the song's famous call ""Baby, Baaaabay, Babbbbay, Ooh my ba-baaaay"" to Cosby's reponse, ""I say Baby, I say Baby--"" Again, I know that you know the scene and the song--it begins with Dave ""Fathead"" Newman's famous lazy bump-and grind tenor sax intro.  For years when I heard the song, the Cosby scene played in my head.  That little girl belting out those words.  It seemed so cute.  So innocent.  Seeing it in the movie, with Marge Hendricks singing it to her lover Ray Charles,  seeing the look of love and lust in her eyes, seeing her eyes wide open as she sings--there is nothing cute about that scene.  Baby don't mean baby in that scene, if you know what I mean.",1108771200,,3579,4.5062111801242235

Jamie Fox carries this movie.  From every move (down to that Ray Charles swagger), to ever word, to every note sung and played on that piano, there's no doubt about it...he IS Ray Charles.

I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I was rather disappointed in the plot or story of this movie.  It centers around Ray's heroin addiction and adulterous behavior more than the music.  Maybe that's just me.  I understand kicking this habit, and the whole metaphor of the heroin turning him into a ""cripple"" is important...I just know there was more to Ray Charles than that.

His two Oscar nominations this year - Best Supporting Actor for ""Collateral"" and Best Actor for THIS movie - are well deserved.  The man can ACT.  He is so successful at inhabiting a role here - I wouldn't bat an eye if I heard he were playing Ronald Reagan in an upcoming film.

Ray Charles was also a stunning once-in-a-lifetime talent, and the combination of Foxx's ability working with the Charles' material is extremely pleasurable.

Jamie Foxx so completely inhabits the personna of Ray Charles that disbelief is totally suspended.  In our minds he IS Ray Charles.

All that being said - it's impossible to make a coherent ""story"" from 20 years of disconnected interludes and anecdotes from Ray's life.  We see young Ray growing up with a mother who wants more for her son than the poverty he is born into.  She challenges him in ways that border on cruelty after he becomes blind, but the movie suggests that it is the hard lessons he learned while young that drove him to greatness later.

We see the young musician Ray, winning the respect and adulation of fans and musicians alike while playing Country, then blending Blues and Gospel to make Soul music.  We see Ray the long-time heroin addict who doesn't think it is a ""problem"" as long as he keeps his musical engagements.  We see Ray the womanizer who doesn't think it is a ""problem"" as long as it only happens on the road.  We see Ray the astute businessman who learns to accept his early cash payments in ones - so that he won't be underpaid - and later negotiates a recording deal ""better than Sinatra's"".  We see the Ray that understands that his music plays well in the south, and continues to play in venues that more progressive black musicians like Quincy Jones won't play.  We also see the Ray who finally understands the wrongness of segregated music halls and takes a stand that no musician before had made - resulting in him being banned from the big money state of Georgia.  We see the proud Ray who is invited back to the Capital of Georgia for an official apology.

2212997,5,B0007IF19K,"Just about everything about in this movie was impressive.  From scanning side-to-side film shots (camera sliding left and right between actors speaking) to an amazing script, this movie lived up to the hype.

I have to admit that I knew very little about Ray Charles before watching this film.  But after viewing this movie I felt like I couldn't learn enough about the man.  He was as talented a musician as there ever was.  And this story on film does a great job of trying to give us a glimpse of the struggles and roadblocks, some of them self-induced, this man suffered through.

There are so many good parts in the movie that it would be impossible to list them all; besides, I don't want to spoil it for the five or six people who might not have watched the movie yet.

Jamie Foxx manages to portray Ray Charles with such a convincing performance that he deserves all the accolades being sent his way.  He, in fact, is so convincing that at times I wanted to look away during the scenes when Ray was becoming addicted to drugs.  It will be extremely hard for Foxx to ever top this performance.

The flashback scenes to Ray's childhood home and surroundings were inserted at just the right times during the film; I have seen directors totally blow that placement in movies.  Taylor Hackford should get director of the year for this movie.  He managed to add just the right amount of music, history, good dialogue, and extras to make this film a complete success.  I would love for him to direct The Running Girl if it ever becomes a movie; wishful thinking on my part.  Seriously, he is going to have a hard time topping this masterpiece.

All of the actors and actresses in this movie were very convincing in their roles.  Combine that fact with the incredible set designs and atmosphere and you have a film that will still be popular fifty years from now.

If you haven't seen this movie because you thought the hype was probably overdone, I suggest you take a look.  It really is that good.

Jamie Foxx is amazing in channeling Ray. The wonderful period feel of all the scenes drew me into this life and made it completely believable. I lost all sense that Jamie Foxx was playing Ray Charles, and the music, supporting cast, and excellent direction drew me all the way in. Ray's addictions just made him more human, and the movie gives a complete picture of Ray the boy, and Ray the man, although I was left wondering how he developed his musicianship, where he got his first piano, how and where he picked up Nat King Cole's music, etc. But this gap in his development is more than made up for in all the rich details that play out for over two hours, which fly by.

Throughout the movie, I forgot that this was Jamie Foxx....to me it was Ray Charles.  He had the movements down, the talk, the jive and the music.  An emotionally rich story covers from his early childhood and the tragedies and dissapointments that cultivated a natural blues and soul voice and through his successful years.  This is not a sugar-coated biography.  Here we also see Ray as the Heroin junkie and womanizer.  But you come away with an emotionally filled experience and realize that despite his imperfections, God gave him a truly unique voice that rose above all his handicaps to acheive legendary status as one of the major figures and forces in American music.

Jamie inhabits the role so intensely one can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  Under masterful direction from Taylor Hackford, RAY is an excellent biopic, whose only fault in my opinion is its length; it seems to go on forever.  But during the time spent with the movie, you are treated to some of Ray Charles' most endearing songs; a tightly focused script featuring superb performances from the supporting cast including Kerry Washington, Regina King, David Krumholtz, Bokeem Woodbine and countless others.  The period detail is impeccable:  costuming, vehicles, everything seems like it came right out of the fifties and sixties.  I don't know the name of the actress who played Ray's mother, but she is wonderful in a fiercely determined performance.  Ray is a legend, conquering all the major fields of contemporary music, showing that an r&b singer can have pop hits, even country hits as demonstrated in his awesome renditions of I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU and BORN TO LOSE. And the picture doesn't sanitize his faults and weaknesses:  he was a womanizer and his addiction to heroin could have ended his career.  It is ironic that after he conquered this addiction, his stance in the recording industry lessened; seemed he did his best work while high.  But as the movie depicts, Ray's conquering of his personal demons kept his family together, and after tonight's six posthumous Grammys, one can say Ray and his music lives on.  Congrats to Foxx for his uncanny embodiment of this musical giant.",1108252800,,1686,4.960854092526691

Throughout the movie,I just couldn't help but wonder when Mr. Charles was going to check into a rehab center.  The life of Ray Charles was a life that many dream to have but with turmoil that you'd never wish on your worst enemy.

Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles alive again from his walk,talk,and to the way he played the piano.

Though pressed hard by life; blindness, heroin addiction, poverty, and racism; his creativity is all the more greatly squeezed from him like fine wine from the press.

I think if Ray Charles was asked, he would tell us that heorin didn't stimulate his genius, it robbed him of it for many years. God gave him a musical gift, not heroin, as some reviewers suggest. The evil one comes to steal, kill, and destroy - not to create.

I had forgotten that he was such a crossover sensation: his songs topped the charts of R&B, Pop, and Country music. Who is like him in this way?

All in all, though, I am left with an aching emptiness for Ray -the pain and regret from the years of infidelity to his wife, estrangement from his family, being cheated by those he trusted most, tortured by drug addiction. I was left wondering in the midst of his despair, did he ever find the peace and love and joy in the Lord that he longed for?",1108080000,,1048,4.304568527918781

So, the movie focuses on the broad arc of Ray's life.  The themes in the movie are Ray's constant infidelities, his addiction to heroine, and the question - how can a blind man every really trust anybody?

2213009,4,B0007IF19K,"4.5 stars.  It would be hard to imagine any other actor winning the Oscar for the Best Actor this year other than Jamie Foxx.  Not only did he get a nomination for his excellent work in ""Collateral"" for Best Supporting Actor, but I know now that he is a lock for Best Actor in ""Ray.""  From the television previews alone I thought he would get a nomination, but now that I've seen his performance in ""Ray,"" well...there is no doubt at all that he will win.  The best parts of this film include Jamie Foxx in a tour-de-force performance, the music itself (which is elegantly staged), but also the highly underrated direction from Taylor Hackford.  Taylor Hackford richly deserves his Oscar-nomination for Best Director.  While it is true that the film does adhere to conventional storytelling techniques a little too often to make this film a seemless biopic, where the second half of Ray Charles life is basically hashed and fed to the audience in the final ten minutes of the film, what is shown here is often mesmerizing and enthralling.  The only real filmmaking flaw, as far as technical aspects are concerned, come in the form of the stylized film editing.  Some of the cuts include a circle of the next scene gradually becoming larger until it fills the whole screen, or the classic peel-away effect that shows a scene right on the heels of the one that just ended (a technique George Lucas used often in ""Star Wars"").  While these effects work occasionally, if they are used too much, as is the case in ""Ray"" it becomes noticable.  I would lose myself in Jamie Foxx's performance only to be reminded by the director that I am watching a movie via an over-used editing technique.  One edit he uses is actually very effective, where the camera slowly goes dark before the next scene begins.  At those times I felt I was inside Ray's head.  The best parts of the film more than make up for the mistakes; Taylor Hackford has enough inspired moments to merit his Oscar-nomination, the music is rendered beautifully, and Jamie Foxx is simply amazing.  The best compliment any actor can receive, I think, is that while watching his movie you forget he is an actor and completely believe he is the character being portrayed.  In this movie Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  Highly recommended.",1107993600,,2285,4.68922305764411

This is a movie that shows the damages of drugs, sex, and fame-and how a man overcame those challenges. Although it doesn't follow Ray's life as does his autobiography (there are some theatrical embellishments, but again, with Ray's approval) it still has the finesse and great acting to be a superb movie.

Foxx's acting is phenominal in this, however all other actors do their jobs just as well. This is an amazing movie, and I encourage anyone reading this to check it out!",1107907200,,699,4.637096774193548

Jamie Foxx took this project on with great gusto, and what an amazing achievement it is! I often forgot i was watching a movie and really thought it was the Real Ray.
I want to make the movie loving public highly aware just how much RAY truly deserves viewing time.
Be prepared for a truly amazing feat - Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles! Ray Charles was a very hip, cool pioneer of music.
This biographic film version doesn't sugarcoat his life in any way. You see it all here -- why he went blind, what his childhood was like, how he got into music and set off on a whirlwind trip into the musical future he had. Drugs, sex, and Ray Charles' music - Not sure how to classify it, very jazzy/bluesy feeling, and maybe a smidge of country. It's filmed in many flashbacks in his life, as it tries to piece together how his life was mapped out.

I didn't see a lot of the films from 2004 nor have I seen many of the Oscar nominees. Ray is the first of that kind. But I will not forget it, and I will watch it many times as I own the DVD.
You will learn, be amazed, and be blown away! Watch Ray!

 I bought the DVD because a friend, whom we share a lot of musical and history interest, told me how great it was.

 After watching the movie, I realized my friend was exactly right and the movie ""Ray"" was THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.  I truly saw Ray Charles throughout the movie.  Jamie Foxx went all out to transform himself to be brother Ray.  Director Taylor Hackman, who worked with Ray Charles and Ray Charles Jr. for the last 15 years on this project, proves to be a master to deliver such a touching and sometimes shocking history of a man who gave so much to the world through music and passion for life.

If Jamie Foxx doesn't win an acadamy award for his portrail of Ray Charles; it will be a travisty.  This is truly a master piece.",1107907200,,955,4.197802197802198
2213015,4,B0007IF19K,"Ray is outstandingly performed by Foxx, who commands attention and plays to role superbly throughout. The directors have done a superb job on this film by grimly portraying Charles' administrative ruthlessness, his selfishness and his egotism. These are shown to be as important in the course of his life as his music.

This film could easily have been a sugary eulogy to a blind black man who triumphed against all odds. What we get instead is realism, human triumph and disaster and genuine highs and lows-pun intended.

The supporting cast are excellent although Ray's relationship with Fathead is left underdeveloped. Really, though, Foxx steals the show. An Oscar surely beckons.

The directors also should be praised for their graphic depiction of how money and talent- but mainly money- make an otherwise ordinary- even unusual- man very attractive to the opposite sex. This grim view of human materialism is pursued throughout. It is hard to remember any characters in the film who provide a stern moral backbone: Ray's mother, of course, is the main example, but she seems almost an irrelevance in her rustic setting, when Ray he jetsetting around the world. Are we to assume there are no profoundly moral people in the wider world away from Ray's childhood?

His wife is flawed by her dependence on him and his assistant- whom he overlooks before the end- is without an audible voice. Ray is beyond the control of a moral agency after the death of his mother. Is this his fault or the fault of those surrounding him? Blame must lie with both. Eventually, of course, Ray remembers his mother and regains a moral consciousness: but not before coniderable damage is done. The historical situation, of course, may have been rather different in this respect: who can know?

The prevailing message of this material is that Ray's power both focuses the spotlight on him AND isolates him. His blindness is an irrelevance. This is profound stuff, and by the standard of the usual eulogies to which this biopic will be compared, it is outstanding. This film sets a new standard which will leave future producers of biopics of the great, the interesting and the glorious much to ponder.",1107820800,,2185,4.926630434782608

Being a jazz enthusiast, I naturally went out to buy the movie as soon as it came out, which is a rarity for me considering I never got the chance to see it when it was in theaters.  While it was over 2 1/2 hours in length, it was an enthralling 2 1/2 hours as you saw RAY go through psychological issues, inner demons, and relationships. While this movie does feature Ray's musical genius, it encompasses more importantly Ray's social issues and Ray's life and how he ended up cleaning up his life from a long drug habit and etc.  Jamie Foxx did an exceptional job portraying RAY and I think that that is some of the best, most convincing acting 1) Jamie Foxx has ever done and 2) One of the best acting jobs any actor did in the year 2004.  Seeing Ray perform in Jazz documentaries and on television, Foxx nailed Charles's mannerisms with incredible accuracy that stunned me.  I think that Foxx is very oscar worthy as the definition of Best actor should be based on the criteria of an actor/actress going out of their ""comfort zone"" (which is comedy for Foxx).  Excellent movie and it taught me so much that I didn't know about Ray Charles's life.  Furthermore, the flashbacks to Charles's childhood were very, very effective.  This is definitely a classic for years to come and I hope that the Academy recognizes its greatness at the 2005 Academy Awards.  5 stars...one of the year's best!!!!",1107820800,,1450,4.5675675675675675

A classic performance.

My wife made an interesting observation while watching ""Ray"".  It's amazing that Ray Charles never overdosed in all those years of shooting heroin, alone in a hotel room more often than not, probably.  He couldn't see how much he was cooking!  Someone must have been watching over him.

However , an actor is only as good as the actors that surround him or her. Therefore , I take my hat off , to the entire cast. From Terrence Howard to Regina King ( who gives a searing performance as Charles's estranged mistress )everyone seemed to give their charactors a heartbeat and a presence, that moves the entire rhythm of the film. The editing is rather choppy , but the directing is top knotch. As for the film , it's a biopic , that starts with Charles's escape from a blind school , and his pilgrimage to find stardom. It's such an amazing story, that it's hard to imagine, anyone getting through Charles's turmoils and challenges , during that period of time. Especially , if you're blind. However , the great thing about this film is that it doesn't try to to make us believe that Ray Charles was a saint. "" Ray "", cleverly, seperates the musical genius from the problems and addictions that plagued him , for most of his life.  I think the director did an excellent job of "" keeping it real "". By showing us that Ray's life wasn't perfect and neither were some of the decisions that he made , allowed us to see how resiliant, he really was. However , there is one dream sequence scene , in which Ray, has an oppurtunity to rectify things, in his past, that's kinda far-fetched.

Shame on the director for allowing the ruination of this great masterpiece in the extended form!

GREAT FILM RUINED- BY BY BAD EDITING.
Here is what others are saying: ""The big disappointment for me was buying the Limited Edition version with the extended edition of the movie. 25 minutes of additional footage has been added back in for the extended version.  Like someone posted earlier, When viewing the ""extended"" version my player had to pause every time it went to a ""deleted scene."" It had to pause again when it went back to the theatrical version. I have other disks in my collection which have extended versions with deleted scenes cut into the film that were done seamlessly.

Not only was there a pause when switching between versions, but many times there was a shift in color cast and certain chapters (18 & 19 for me)of the movie became unwatchable and just froze up. For 30 Bucks I found this to be disgraceful and I will ask Best Buy for either another copy or just get the standard edition..

You have the option to watch either the original version or this extended version. The image quality, color and clarity vary a bit as it cuts between the theatrical version and the deleted scenes. Clearly, this wasn't recut and retimed for this ""extended"" version. The difference between the finished film and the added scenes are quite noticeable and jarring. A flawed masterpiece, Ray would have been a better film if the 25 minutes of additional footage had been integrated into this DVD in a better fashion than it is. No justice for the consumer, and none for the artists of the film and artist portrayed in the film.""

2213023,5,B0007IF19K,"The buzz about this film centers mainly around the brilliance of Jamie Foxx in the title role. While these accolades aren't unjustified, the movie also benefits from a brilliant supporting cast and a laser sharp attention to detail. Best of all there is an earnest attempt on the part of the late Ray Charles and of the director to tell the story with honesty; this is a trait lacking in many biopics.

While most of the film follows Charles' life in a linear fashion, we get several short episodes from his early life, usually in the form of flashbacks on the part of the main character. The most poignant of these is the musician's recollection of his brother's death, which he witnessed firsthand. This episode, which occurred when Charles was only six, was a major source of guilt for the rest of his life.

Many viewers will appreciate that there are at least four great roles in the movie for women. While his extra-marital affairs are an unfortunate reality of the musician's life, these women are played brilliantly by Regina King and Aunjanue Ellis. Director Taylor Hackford reveals in his commentary that Sharen Warren's only credits before this film were parts in community theatre, which makes her effort as Ray's mother, Aretha Robinson, all the more impressive. Kerry Washington also shines as Della Charles, the gospel singer who would become Ray's wife.

The movie pursues Ray's double life as a man who publicly dazzles with his musical genius, but privately suffers from the demons in his soul. He uses heroin and numerous women to self-medicate and to forget his pain. His drug use continued for some time until Ray he went into rehab and faced some of his issues.

An interesting aspect of the film concerns just how Ray Charles overcame his disability. He gives clues along the way, such as the use of hard-heeled shoes so that he could hear the echoes of his footsteps against walls. He also used a numbering system so that he would always wear the right colored socks with his shirts and trousers.

Finally, for anyone who has studied the progression of popular musicians, the journey of Charles from a sound-a-like, who mimics artists such as Nat King Cole to an innovator, who blends gospel with rhythm and blues to create his own unique sound, is fascinating. One key to his musical progression was surrounding himself with people like his wife Della, who he could always count on to tell it to him ""straight."" Another key was the support of Atlantic Records, whose producers encouraged the young artist to develop his own sound. The lion's share of Charles' journey, of course, is due to his genius as a musician; to get into the mind of such a brilliant man would be amazing. It's a testament to this film's greatness that it can start us on that path, yet be so entertaining.",1107734400,,2804,4.749486652977413

2213025,4,B0007IF19K,"It has been said that this script has been passed around Hollywood for over a decade. Ray Charles, before he died, personally worked on this project. For this film, despite Jamie Foxx's musical abilities, they used Ray Charles' voice and all the original, albeit remastered, recordings.

RAY has been huge at the box office. It did real well at the Golden Globes, and it is expected to do equally as well at the Oscars. The film is more than two and half hours in length, and at times it feels like it. It covered the first turbulent three decades of the life of Ray Charles, from 1933-1966.

Ray Charles Robinson was a fighter, and his adversaries were formidable. He had to fight against ""Racism"", as all black entertainers did in the 40's and 50's. In 1961, Charles refused to perform in his home state of Georgia, because black folks were not allowed into the concerts.  He had to fight ""Blindness"", and he probably had glaucoma. He may not have been totally blind, at least not in those early years. He never used a dog guide, or a long white cane. In addition, he had to fight ""Heroin"". He started out like many musicians in the 40's smoking a little weed, and then he graduated to smack, and real addiction. This battle with drugs colored the whole plot. It was presently unflinchingly, unmasked. Ray Charles must have felt that drug addiction was his greatest demon. He also drank way too much, and he was a legendary womanizer. At one point in the credits to the film, it was pointed out that he had 23 children. Some feel that it was a much larger number.

Jamie Foxx is incredibly good as Ray Charles. At one point in Foxx's life, he had considered being a concert pianist. He played all the music, and all the close-ups himself. Nothing had to be faked; and he did so while wearing occluder prosthetics that simulated blindness. Foxx spend some time with the actual Ray Charles, but mostly he studied film of the younger version of the man.

Foxx did not imitate Ray Charles--he inhabited him. His body movements, far from blindisms or drug-induced twitchs--were more like choreography than mimicry. His swaying and bobbing while playing the music were like using his whole body as a baton, conducting the music. During the musical numbers, one was never aware of lip-synching, because Foxx sang all the songs full out; they just didn't use his voice in the final cuts. So this did not seem like an impersonation. It became almost metaphysical, like the actor was channeling the essence of Ray Charles.

One critic wrote,"" Hackford's film is never as good as Foxx's performance--but it is still an ode to the genius of Ray Charles.""  Without Foxx, cerainly the film would have been more pedestrian--but the film has Jamie Foxx, and this elevated it to some level of greatness.",1107734400,,2788,4.677551020408163
2213026,4,B0007IF19K,"Both my husband and I really enjoyed this film, crying several times and gaining new appreciation for the talents of both Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx.

But I must warn purchasers and viewers away from the TERRIBLE ""extended version"" on the DVD. This version is merely the theatrical film with the deleted scenes added, always choppily and distractingly, with a strange music note icon appearing on and off to add to the confusion. Scenes are cut off, lighting and angles change glaringly, one scene has four or five versions of the same dialogue that play one after the other... it really detracted from our overall enjoyment of the film.

I'm surprised that it was released as a watchable version of ""Ray,"" an otherwise very impressive film.",1107734400,,741,4.873015873015873
2213027,5,B0007IF19K,"I know about this film and how great it was but never got to the theater to see it this past summer. But upon seeing it on DVD I'm amazed. At first I didn't know if comedian Jamie Foxx would not only be able to handle a dramatic role but of RAY CHARLES???Well not only does he do a brilliant job but everything from his walk,smile and dialog make one believe that Rya Charles is starring as himself! I expected a credible performance,just not a brilliant one. Ray's rise from childhood trauma of all sorts,years of serious musical dues paying and ever converging drug addictions and extra marital affairs were all part of the life of this man who,wihin a short ten years or so managed to change the entire course of American music and in doing so delighting and irritating all different kinds of people.

Throughout the film Ray is portrayed as a man dealing the lies and the truth,with the religious and the then profane and with the inner conflicts of himself-often all at once. Thankfully the story (as easy as I understand it could've) never resorted to cheap showbiz/celebrity gossip,instead relying on the successes and failiars of his personal life and the many triumphs of his career. One thing it doesn't do is cover the last two decades of his life-ending with his 1979 recieving of a special acheivment award from the state of Georgia. But for a movie of it's scope,INCREDIBLE directing and acting on the part of all and as the epitaph for the now passed living legend 'Ray' is the ideal portrait for a human being with a unique musical presence within him and how his humanity inhanced and/or got in the way of it. I highly recommend this film to anyone with an interest in great cinema and great music alike!",1107734400,,1721,4.587662337662338

His portrayal was so brilliant that I hardly blinked.  And when it ended I said to myself ""That's it?!""  The thing that makes it great is that it isn't sanitized, they show the good, bad and ugly.  All of the scenery, and costumes reflect the time period, and the acting is superb.  I learned a lot of things I didn't know about him, and he really became successful despite being blind, poor, an addict and a womanizer.  It is very compelling, and the music is excellent.

2213029,3,B0007IF19K,"Ray is a great movie and Jamie Foxx's performance is spectacular.
The DVD, however, lures you with the promise of an extended edition including 25min of additional footage. Well, that is true, but they way it is presented is very annoying. When you choose to play the extended edition, the movie skips back and forth to the deleted scenes at the appropriate points during the movie. Granted, maybe my DVD player is not the fastest one out there, which makes the skips very obvious, but the way the extended scenes are cut you end up seeing bits and pieces of the scenes twice, like Oberon's introduction of Ray in the club. This is extremely annoying and caused me to switch back to the original version after the third ""extended scene"".
The sad part is, that, since this is a 2 DVD edition, there would have been enough room for putting both editions separately on the DVDs with room to spare for the special features.",1107734400,,919,4.609756097560975
2213030,5,B0007IF19K,"After watching the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards I was thinking that Jamie Foxx is going to win the Best Actor Oscar for ""Ray"" because everybody is going to want to hear him do another acceptance speech (he has to be saving the best for last).  Of course, after watching ""Ray"" it becomes obvious the members of the Academy have an even better reason for honoring the performance, even if Foxx is not having a year in which his career has reached the high water mark with another Oscar nomination for his ""Supporting Role"" in ""Collateral and his SAG nomination for his performance in ""Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story"" on television.  True, Foxx does not do his own singing in ""Ray,"" but he does play the piano and why would you want to hear anybody other than Ray Charles sing?  In 20th century American popular music in terms of signers there is Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Ray Charles.  I keep trying to come up with one more for the thumb, but Woody Guthrie or Bob Dylan are more songwriters than singers and everybody else you can name as singers are just not in that league.

The film by director Taylor Hackford and screenwriter James L. White basically tells the story of how Ray Charles came to two pivotal moments in his life.  The first is when he took the emerging sound of Rhythm & Blues and added gospel powered vocals to basically create soul music when ""I Got a Woman"" was released in 1955.  Everything he sings before that point is pretty good, such as ""Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand,"" but it is not great and it all sounds more like Nat ""King"" Cole or Charles Brown that the authentic Ray Charles.  So the first part of the movie has to do with Ray Charles finding his voice.  The rest of ""Ray"" is the load road to the second pivotal point, where Charles kicks his heroin habit.

Except for a choice moment of person redemption from the Georgia State Legislature, the story of Ray Charles is over at that point.  We can then turn from the DVD to CDs of Ray Charles singing all of the songs we heard him sing in the movie from ""Night Time is the Right Time"" (a.k.a. the number from ""The Cosby Show"" for the younger generations) and ""What I'd Say"" to ""Georgia"" and ""Hit the Road Jack.""  But the great irony is that after Charles kicked his drug habit he was never as great.  He was still very, very good, making any song he sang his own, as when he covered ""Yesterday,"" ""Eleanor Rigby,"" ""Look What They've Done to My Song, Ma,"" ""Living for the City"" and ""America.""  But the creative fire was gone.  That is why this film ends where it does.  You would not say that the career of Ray Charles was ever in descent, but clearly the glory days of ascension had ended.

""Ray"" is a reminder of the greatness of Ray Charles as a singer.  It is sad that the singer died shortly after the film was shot because he should be deservedly basking in the glory along with Foxx.  But then there is no doubt that Ray Charles knew he was an American institution.  Still, I wonder if he had to do it over again if Ray Charles would have avoided doing drugs.  In the context of this 2004 biopic Ray's motivation for doing drugs is his feelings of guilt over the accidental death of his younger brother when they were children (and before Charles went blind).  His ability to kick heroin is tied to his coming to terms with that personal tragedy, so the argument is that it was not the drugs that fueled the way he played the piano and sang, but rather guilt.  If you took away that guilt would that destroy his passion?  If you took away the drugs would that passion have simply destroyed him?  Today we live in a world with Ray Charles, but this film suggests the possibility of a world where we never would have known he was alive and convinces us that would have been even worse.",1107734400,,3822,4.3872340425531915

I am glad that the life of Mr. Charles wasn't sanitized for the movie. He wasn't perfect as a man,but he was perfect as a singer. He lifted himself out of the grip of heroin,and never looked back.

I am rooting for Mr. Foxx to win the Oscar. He is a very gifted young man,and deserves all the adulation he has received because of this movie.",1107648000,,616,4.433628318584071
2213032,4,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"" is a remarkable biopic of legendary songwriter/musician Ray Charles. It avoids many of the pitfalls that bedevil most movies of this type. After all, it's difficult to synthesize the life of a very famous person into a movie that doesn't run so long an audience can't sit through it. [""Ray"" runs 2  hours, but doesn't seem long at all.] You have to resort to cliches to keep the dramatic movement going. ""Ray"" does have its cliches and its pop psychology, but these are overwhelmed by a focus on Charles' music and by Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray, which is so good that there simply is not another choice for this year's Best Actor Oscar.

Nominated for 6 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director.",1107648000,,724,4.692913385826771
2213033,5,B0007IF19K,"First of all, I was not a fan of Ray Charles' music, because I haven't listen to his work that much, but I liked his Diet Pepsi commercials. I had no idea that his life was so remarkably painful and inspirational. I also hesitated on seeing this movie at the cinemas, because I was not a fan of Jamie Foxx. After seeing him in this entertaining and emotionally impacting film, I trully admire his performance that is definitely the top five of the year! I don't know if the Oscar people think he's ready  for the gold or not, since it's his first nod. Even though he's very deserving to win, I have a feeling they are going to give it to Leo. My choice is either Jamie Foxx or the non-nominees including Jeff Bridges, Paul Giamatti, and Liam Neeson.

This movie chronicles the life and career of Ray Charles Robinson, starting with his early days doing gigs at a small bar all the way to recording albums, and touring the country when he became increasingly successiful. It also covered his marriage, the affairs with the singers in the band and his fans. More importantly, we get to see flashbacks of his childhood when he was in Florida living in proverty with his mom and younger brother who accidently drown to death, and he felt guilty about it for many years. It was this traumatic event that propelled him to abuse cocain for many years, and it ultimately hurt his career and relationships. It took him some serious rehab time to recover from his addiction. He also learned to let go and forgive himself when his dead brother and mother came into his dreams during his recovery.

We get to hear many of Ray's greatest hits throughout the film, and my favorites are Georgia On My Mind and Hit The Road Again. Ray's had a very hard life, and he's probably the most unlikely person to become a legendary musician, because of his upbringing and being a blind person since early childhood. So many obstacles and people wanted to take an advantage of his talent. That's why his life is so inspirational.

I thought the actress who played Ray's mother was very outstanding compared with the other female leads. She should've gotten a Best Supporting Actress nomination.",1107648000,,2169,4.596899224806202
2213034,5,B0007IF19K,"As you look at this film it maybe Jamie Foxx that you see, but Ray Charles Robinson Sr. is VERY PRESENT!  I was not a fan of Jamie Foxx's BUT NOW with Collateral, Redemption, and Ray... Jamie DESERVES TO CARRY AWAY A TON OF OSCARS!

This isn't a MERE impersonation of Ray Charles.  Jamie Foxx provides one of ""THE BEST PERFORMANCES"" I have ever witnessed!

It's a remarkable summary of Ray's early childhood where he witnessed the death of his younger brother and gradually the loss of his sight; his musical career from 1948 until the mid-1960s; and his heroin addiction.

This eye opening drama shows you Ray Charles strengths as a musical innovator, and also his weaknesses as a womanizer and a heroin addict.

My heart ached, and rejoiced all through this movie.  I cried, laughed, and cheered.  Hurting for how he was mistreated, how he had to suffer.  But then how he himself mistreated people.  Watching as he fought through bigotry being both a blind man as well as a black man along with his increasingly growing drug addiction.  How lonely it must've been for Ray with the nightmares, and being there in the dark!

The ENTIRE CAST was great.  Ellis, and Regina King were both great ""leading ladies"" I also like that Clifton Powell wasn't a bad guy in this one.  The scenes were perfect to that period, the suits, the cars, and furniture.

This story is so compelling, I just can't imagine people not feeling THE FULL EFFECT of Ray Charles!  His music, his life, his battles.  He's a legend in his own rights.  Anyone who disagrees needs to ""HIT THE ROAD JACK!""

2213035,4,B0007IF19K,"I missed ""Ray"" in theaters last fall.  It's entirely my failing, but my mood was just never conducive to a downbeat, two-and-a-half hour dissection of someone I prefer to remain in awe of.

Having seen it now on DVD, I sorely wish I'd seen and heard it in theaters because it's a joltingly good film.  It understands the music and presents it in an absolutely riveting way; it respects the side characters (the Raylettes, Ertegum, Wexler, Fathead, Dowd, et al) and while the film may have a few more glowing sunbeams and moments of boldfaced exposition than I would've preferred, it really gets to the core of its central figure.

What more can be said about Jamie Foxx as Ray?  I'll say that he creates a spooky combination of magic and electricity.  Some complain that he's merely doing an impersonation, and there's a grain of truth to that, but what a tricky and idiosyncratic impersonation it is. Somehow Foxx articulates a crucial by-product of Ray's necessary self-reliance: what must have been an almost purgatorial sense of loneliness. Had Foxx been just a hair or two off, the whole show would've been sunk but he pulls it off gloriously.

His performance is matched by, and married to, the music, which is fantastic.  So many scenes stick out for me -- Ray, ecstatically smacking the lid of his piano during ""Straighten Up and Fly Right"" ; the harmonies of the Raylettes, combined with the faces of the actresses, during ""Leave My Woman Alone"" and ""What Kind of Man Are You?"" ; the furious, kinetic leap into ""The Messaround"" and especially the segue between one of the most devastating scenes in the film (Ray's childhood descent into blindness) and the lilting, electric notes that lead into ""Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand.""

That's one of my favorite moments of the past year; it seems a gently musical way of saying, ""Yes, terrible things happen, but sometimes they lead to beautiful things like this....""",1107648000,,1918,4.787878787878788
2213036,5,B0007IF19K,"It's sad that this film turned out to be a tribute, instead of a celebration of a living legend. Thankfully Ray himself was deeply involved in the production, and knew the love & respect felt for him & his contributions. His musical impact & genius will remain unmatched for a long time, but not unrecognized.

Since the focus of this was Ray's early days, the tunes were AWESOME and many the general public is probably not familiar with. Thank goodness the decision was made to use Ray's original vocal tracks! VERY moving, and hearing his development while watching it portrayed in the context of his life is what really tore me up. VERY well done use of film to add impact to music that already is timeless. Just can't quite guess which Oscar goes to THAT... 'Best Soundtrack' would be a slight, it's such an understatement.

All the reviewers are raving about Jamie Foxx's portrayal. He did an excellent job, no doubt. I feel more strongly about the whole film than the individual performances, though. Very moving, and the story of Ray's development of his musical identity was stirring. All the cast was excellent, certainly Oscar material...

Certainly a MUST SEE for all lovers of GREAT R&B MUSIC!! , thumbs WAY up! (Exercise caution, this is NOT a 'family film' for the kiddies.) Hopefully there will be a sequel going through the rest of Ray's career;, with the buzz about Jamie Foxx in this one, it should be a sure thing.

Did you think Russell Crowe was robbed of the Oscar for ""Beautiful Mind""? Jamie Foxx' performance is the same caliber - if not better. I have never seen a more pitch perfect performance of a legend. It left me wanting more - and more and more.

Kudos (posthumously) to Ray Charles. It takes a lots of guts to let some of this stuff be documented. But it made the film even more rivetting and compellimg. And I can't say enough about his ""training"" of Jamie Foxx (who I have to admit I never was a fan of before this).

Regina King got snubbed by the Oscars as did Kerry washington. the Acting on here is top notch. the Bonus  material is tight especially with Ray Charles&Jamie Foxx during there Jam session. I'm so Proud of Brother Jamie Foxx. He is a Great Example of when you give a Black Man the chance to further enhance Himself His Craft you get huge rewards such as this film. I remember when Bil cosby&others Frowned on Brother Jamie Foxx after he did ""Booty Call""&other so-so to forgetable roles&acted like that was all he could do,but  the Brother proved all Wrong in this Film. RIP Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx  knocked it out the Box from start to finish. I read on Ray Charles as a child&always thought the Music World of Him because as a Musician he was so Versatile. You name the Style&Brother Ray could do it. I still remember reading Billboard Magazine as a child&Being Blowned away that this soul Brother was on almost all of the Charts. he had no Limits to His Creativity. He was a Musical Gumbo without limits. this film deals with many aspects of His Career. Him Owning His Masters&controlling His Masters especially for a Black Artist in the 60's was as Ground Breaking as His Music was. ain't no doubt in my mind that unless the Oscars are fixed there is no way that Jamie Foxx doesn't win for Best Actor. he was the Entertainer of the Year for 2004 bar none. Props to Taylor Hackford for getting this long overdue film out here.the acting was Incredible all the way.all the Actors&Actress;s deserve a extra Bonus for this Film.",1107561600,,1663,4.493377483443709
2213040,5,B0007IF19K,"No matter which name they announce on Oscar night, Jamie Foxx will still be the winner. The only true competition this year would have been Jeff Bridges' searing performance in The Door in the Floor or Paul Giamannti in Sideways and neither one of these actors was nominated. Foxx's performance towers above everyone else nominated this year. He channels Charles' energy, quirks, movements and personality in a performance that doesn't just mimic Charles but goes right to the heart of the man.

Director Taylor Hackford's love of music infuses this film as it has just about every other one he's directed. The difference here is that Hackford truly has found a larger-than-life but very mortal artist that changed the sound of R&B by merging it seamlessly with the emotional power of gospel, country and western and just about any other genre Charles effortlessly tackled. What makes Ray so powerful is its unflincing honesty about Charles' demons and infidelities. It also shows that, regardless of Charles' sins, his salvation always could be found in the emotional core of his music.

Ray looks very good on DVD. The length of the theatrical release along with the inclusion of deleted scenes for the longer DVD release means that the image quality has been compromised just a tad. The colors are rich with remarkable detail and the solid blacks are highlights of this transfer. 25 minutes of additional footage has been added back in for the extended version. You have the option to watch either the original version or this extended version. The image quality, color and clarity vary a bit as it cuts between the theatrical version and the deleted scenes. Clearly, this wasn't recut and retimed for this ""extended"" version. The difference between the finished film and the added scenes are quite noticeable and jarring. The 5.1 soundtrack features a rich full bodied sound that immediately pulls you into the action. Charles' songs (featuring both original and new recordings) sound terrific in the 5.1 format.

The inclusion of the 25 minutes of footage is a welcome addition but there are a couple of problems. Unlike Fox's superb extended branching editions of the Alien films, the disc pauses as it searches for the deleted scenes. This disrupts the continuity and flow of the movie. Personally, I would have preferred this in a 2 disc set featuring both the theatrical cut and the extended version along with extras on the flipside of one of these discs. There IS a two disc edition but it's bogged down by extras many of which are little more than padding. We also get to see the complete uncut performances of Ray & The Raelettes performing Hit the Road Jack and a number of other tracks cut for the film. Walking in His Shoes features Jamie Foxx discussing his performance of Charles and Charles himself performing with Foxx. Luckily Foxx was trained as a classical pianist so he aquits himself very well when they goof around ont he Charles chestnut ""Mess Around"". It's fun to watch and a worthwhile addition to the set. Ray Remembered features interviews with those that worked with him past and present both on his albums and those that observed him while working on the film. The differences between the single disc edition and the double disc are in the extras. The two disc edition features a number of fascinating featurettes on the women in Charles' life, the ""Soulmates"" featurette, a documentary on Taylor Hackford's love of Charles' music and difficulty in getting the project made and an exceptionally good documentary on Charles entitled ""Ray: An American Journey"". If you aren't likely to dip your toe into these feauturettes and documentaries than the extra cost for the two disc set isn't probably going to be worth it for you. There's also a booklet on Charles and the making of the film. The single disc edition of the movie is presented in the dreaded dual sided, dual layered format. Why dreaded? Because this format doesn't stand up to wear and tear as well. Universal probably should have released this two editions; a two disc set (vs. the dual layered, dual sided version) and a three disc set at affordable prices. Surely if other studios can release the two disc sets and make a profit, then Universal can as well.

 Taylor Hackford's incisive commentary track tackles a wide range of topics from the challenges of shooting the film, recreating the past and the wonder and awe he felt working with both Foxx and Charles. Hackford also documents where the film veers from reality and the dramatic reasons why. It's one of the few solo commentary tracks worth listening to from beginning to end.

 A flawed masterpiece, Ray would have been a better film if the 25 minutes of additional footage had been integrated into this DVD in a better fashion than it is. Nevertheless, Hackford's passion for music and interest in the subject along with the terrific performances from Foxx and the rest of the cast makes this an essential purchase for fans of Charles' music. Although the portrait it paints is frequently less than complimentary and unpleasant, it also allows us to understand the passion that drove this singular artist to help create a unique sound in music.",1107561600,,5203,4.892290249433106

Ray Charles had several interesting experiences and the audience is to visually experience a number of them through the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx.  The story begins with how Ray travels across America by Greyhound while facing prejudice not only to his skin color, but also in regards to his blindness.  Through Ray's experiences the film uses flashbacks to where he learned how to handle several of the situations, as his mother urged him to not accept the pity of others.  Instead his mother taught him how to stand on his own two feet, and how to be righteous person with good morals.

The moments when Ray recollects his past and his mother's advice are initially happy with memories of his brother and his mom despite their poverty.  However, these memories slowly turn into a darkness and internal turmoil, as Ray begins to hallucinate about water and wet floors.  This unhappy memory seems to torment Ray in ways that handicaps him from function like a normal human being.  Through his first job as a pianist for a small group he is introduced to pot, which helps him self-medicate his personal issues.  Pot ends up being the key to Pandora's box, as he eventually moves to heavier drugs to deal with his painful memory that seem to burden him beyond reason.

Eventually Ray meets Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) from Atlantic Records, and he is intrigued by Ray's musical skills, and offers him to stop thinking about pennies, and instead focus on making dollars.  Through Ray's partnership with Atlantic Records he is encouraged to develop his own sound, but it is difficult for him, as he has always played what others desired.  After a radio interview in Huston, Texas, Ray meets with Della Bea (Kerry Washington) who he ends up marrying, but she also encourages him to be himself in regards to everything.  This leads to Ray toward making his own first hit, ""I Got a Woman"", which brings out Ray's new and personal sound through a fusion of gospel and rhythm & blues.  The music is an essential portion of the film; as it brings light and color into hearing Ray's way of perceiving the world.

Through hit songs with new sounds such as ""Georgia on My Mind"", ""Hit the Road Jack"", and ""Unchain My Heart"" among many others Ray Charles' popularity grew.  However, the songs became a tool for him to exorcise his own demons that haunted him through the many experiences that he had acquired while being on the road.  Being on the road meant illicit drugs, numerous women, and overwhelming guilt, as he felt ashamed cheating on his wife.  Together the guilt and his self-medicated heroin addiction grew stronger while he developed drug jitters and other drug related behaviors.  The combined affect of his personal life, drug addiction, and the past memories kept haunting him as he could recall the death of his younger brother for which he still felt tremendous guilt.  The world began to close in on him, as the law enforcement was arresting him for drug possession, and his wife was about to leave him while noticing that his musical career were slipping out of his hands.  With the many experiences that Ray had he still reflected over what his mother once taught him, and trusted her life lessons to guide him on the right path.

Ray is a poignant film by Taylor Hackford who made films such as The Devil's Advocate (1997) and An Officer and a Gentleman (1982).  Hackford brings a very authentic feel to the many places that Ray Charles played though the use of good mise-en-scene, an excellent cast, and vivid cinematography.  In addition, the jumps between hallucinations, flashbacks, and reality offer the audience a genuine sense of how Ray must have felt, but this is also enhanced by Jamie Foxx's outstanding performance.  The flashbacks, too, are colorful, which accentuates the importance of his childhood, and especially his mother, but it also flashes some light on how important those moments before blindness might have been.  The flashbacks are also drenched in emotional substance, which the audience gets to experience through Ray in his dark world.  Ultimately, Ray offers the audience a brilliant cinematic experience that should be reflected upon with closed eyes while pondering on our own experiences and those who have affected our life choices.",1107561600,,4878,4.883495145631068
2213042,5,B0007IF19K,"I was blessed to have the opportunity to open for Ray Charles during my freshman year in college as a member of our jazz orchestra.  To actually personally witness this genious was absolutely inexplicable.  After watching the film, I was so ashamed of the state of Georgia (I'm from Atlanta) I had no idea he was treated in this manner (I was 8 years old when the ban was lifted in 1979).

This DVD is a certified masterpiece!  I do wish, however, that there were more extras.  After all, we are talking about someone who has done so much for American music, despite his visual impairment.  The timing for this movie was perfect.  I couldn't imagine anyone else masterfully portraying Ray Charles other than Jamie Foxx.  The supporting cast was awesome as well, full of extremely talented and highly underrated actors and actresses.  This film further immortalizes the ""genious"" as an American legend for many decades to come.

Rest in peace, Ray.  Thank you for approving this film and allowing us to take a peek into your life before you left us.  Jamie did you proud!",1107561600,,1070,4.693548387096774
2213043,5,B0007IF19K,"I know some reviewers are upset with the studio's marketing of this CD, but at least it's not riddled with advertising, trailers and other distracting promos.  And the bonus features are terrific and plentiful.  The DVD market is where they're making their real money these days and it's hard to complain when a movie is this all-around excellent.

Hackford's signature style is everywhere and it works...  The music is stirring and the ensemble cast is truly amazing.  One of the best examples of actors in perfect orchestration that I can name...all masterfully led by Jamie Foxx, who is certainly the breakout star of 2004.  And I thought Johnny Depp could do anything!  Foxx is uncanny, especially if you are already a fan of his diversity through his work in COLLATERAL and in stand-up comedy.

Sure to take home some gold statuettes on Academy Awards night, RAY is a must-see and must-own for film fans and Ray Charles' admirers, as well.",1107561600,,944,4.85625
2213044,5,B0007IF19K,"It's tremendously difficult to portray a celebrity who is so ingrained in our minds and memories as is Ray Charles, but somehow this movie manages to do so.  In every facial expression and bodily movement, Jamie Foxx IS Ray Charles.  One can only imagine the number of hours Foxx must have spent, talking to, watching tape and listening to recordings of this musical phenom in order to prepare for this role.  Foxx is not the only one to turn in a spectacular performance.  He is surrounded with talented actors and actresses whose performances are a perfect complement to his.  Throughout the movie we see flashbacks of his early life, from the wisdom of his poor but proud mother, to the tragic death of his little brother.  The music weaves in and out and reminds the viewer of the talent and versatility of Ray Charles.  The story is not sugar-coated and it portrays the weaknesses of a flawed personality as well as his triumphs.  It is a hugely entertaining film and is well-deserving of the Academy Award nominations which it recently received.",1107475200,,1051,4.767955801104972
2213045,1,B0007IF19K,"This is not a review, but more of a rant on my part as a DVD Collector of 260+ DVD's. Please view this as an individual opinion on Universal, not on the content of the Film, Ray.

  Does anybody else feel how unjust the price of the Limited Edition set is? I mean, how can Universal do this, this is legal crime, and it never ceases to amaze me.

  Take this into consideration: The Schindler's List Limited Gift Set (Also A Universal Title) has the dvd, soundtrack, photo book, book style DVD case, film cell framed in printed cardboard, certificate of authenticity (even though they are meaningless), and a hard plastic sleeve that sits in a giant plexiglass box with metal support rods. Retail price = $34.98.

  Ray Limted Edition has the DVD, pretty standard extras given comparison to DVD's like LOTR, Gone With The Wind, Panic Room, and many others, a book style DVD case with photo album attached within it. Retail Price = $44.98. At Best Buy, I paid $36.99 for my Ray Limited Edition, here on Amazon it was cheaper I remember but at the time I am writing this it is not in stock, Schindler's List Gift Set sells at Best Buy for $32.98, and only $24.49 here on Amazon. Return of the King Extended Edition, I paid $22.99 during the first week of release when it was on sale, on Amazon it's still an affordable $23.99. WHERE IS THE JUSTIFICATION IN THE PRICING??

  Film Distributors are out of line, and will stay that way. You know why? Because we the consumer don't have a choice. Only Universal can sell Ray. So if I want a decent set of extras I have to pay, and I will fork over the cash, because it is the only way to get it. I wish there was a way for consumers to fight back without having to sacrifice our love for our favorite films, films that we want to own.

  Also may I add that the video quality of this DVD is atrocious, very dull and grainy. No justice for the consumer, and none for the artists of the film and artist portrayed in the film.",1107475200,,1966,4.3188010899182565
2213046,4,B0007IF19K,"Look, I'm not going to write about the film ""Ray."" It's impossible to argue against the brilliant performance of Jamie Foxx and the only real problem is, as someone else pointed out, the end which has no real resolution and feels like the project was simply ended with little thought. My real complaint / warning involves the ""limited edition"" package.

I haven't posted reviews here because I have so little free time, but I'm tired of double disk sets that don't meet the expectations they tease. It seems like the studios have realized that we will spend an extra $10 to get more features and are exploiting this fact. Look at this edition of ""Ray."" Of all the supplemental features, only one is substantial. The long documentary, ""Ray:An American Journey"" is really the only bonus feature worth watching. ""Walking in His Shoes,"" ""The Women of Ray,"" and ""Ray Remembered"" each lasts at best 10 minutes and are simply new combinations of interviews and facts already contained in the longer doc. Basically, they are padding, recycled material used to justify a $30+ price tag. There is absolutely no reason that the studio couldn't have done a single disk edition that contained all the features, but by splitting them up, using portions over and over, they con us into spending extra cash. Personally, I would rather have a single, comprehensive doc than a series of repetitive mini features. What a shame. Ray, I'm sorry man.

This movie is amazing not because it tells the true story of a black musician on the rise ... it's amazing because it tells the story of a MAN who overcomes more than one obstical and does so without complaint.  I have also, like many who have written reviews, watched the special features on the DVD and I agree totally that Jamie Foxx not only nailed the performance ... it was almost like destiny for Mr. Foxx.

In short, watch this film.  Even if you hate music and don't even know who Mr. Charles was, the story is worth the time.",1107475200,,671,4.301587301587301

This movie shows me what i missed in that time period. He was a simply amazing man with talent unheard of. Ray Charles is an inspiration to me and should be for everyone in the world.  Jamie Foxx should win Best Performance with his amazing job of acting as Ray. After watching the special features with the real Ray Charles, i realized how good of a job Foxx did. Everything Foxx does is the EXACT same way Ray would have done it. Simply amazing. I was blown away when watching the movie, all the hardships that Ray Charles overcame with his blindness, and his heroin addiction, his flashbacks to his brother's accidental drowning...just inspires me more than i have been ever before.

2213050,5,B0007IF19K,"Like some who have reviewed this movie, I knew little about Ray Charles but after seeing this, I had to witness his incredible music. To be honest, I was surprised to see Jamie Foxx acting as the legendary Ray Charles. His performance in this is what I can only describe as INGENIOUS. If I hadn't seen this movie, I probably wouldn't have even come across Charles' great work of art. I have laid all my eggs in one nest, meaning I have only been listening to one source of music my whole life- rap music. But after seeing this music, I have learnt that you shouldn't lay your eggs in one nest (that goes for everyday life situations too, like relationships etc.). I have now taken the time to settle myself into music like reggae, blues, jazz and funk, and I must say, I have been missing out on incredible things for the last 18 years of my life.

It's the story of a man who was blinded at an early age and faced some horrors of life, including racism. For years, he was doubted because of his skin color but it just goes to show, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Though he was blind, Ray had the gift to make incredible music in his head and play it on the piano. Not only that, but he was given the talent to use such a powerful and incredible voice that soared throughout the whole world. Through his lifetime, Ray experiences many changes- he becomes a father but cheats on his wife with other women (thus, ending up in horrible situations), he becomes addicted to heroin, he smokes every 5 seconds and so on. Also, many record companies had used him for his talent so they could get the money.

Ray Charles was a genius and still is, even through his death. This movie has grown a lot on me since I've seen it and I'd see it again and again. That's how powerful and touching this movie is.

Like I said, Jamie Foxx performs at his VERY best, hell, you could even say Foxx and Charles look like twins with the glasses on and the smile. I wouldn't be surprised if Foxx won an Academy for this, for he deserves it for so much effort.

For all those who have done the same thing as me and have seen this movie, I suggest you should expand your knowledge in music. Ray Charles showed the world that he stood against all odds and won, this fact proves that ""what doesn't kill a real man can only make him stronger"". That's a fact that made Ray what he is today and forever.

2213051,5,B0007IF19K,"Giving life to a character who only exists on the printed page is a challenge to an actor.  Making your performance mimic that of a real life person with as much vitality and genius as Ray Charles would almost be an Olympian endeavor.  Maybe in twenty or so years it wouldn't be, but there are many people who have grown up with Charles' music, seen him live, and on television.

Jamie Foxx worked blindfolded alongside Ray Charles to learn to play piano, walk, move like a blind man.  How he managed to imbue the role with the soul of the man, is comparable in acting to Charles' musical talent.

No, the story isn't pretty.  Charles moved from alcohol to heroin with almost the same rocket-like speed as his career.  He also had affairs with his backup singers.  The movie doesn't gloss over any of this--or the dues he paid as consequences.

The music is wonderful--overseen by Mr. Charles before his death, the acting is superb.  Overall, the movie's an inspiration and very worth having in your collection.

I do not recommend the long version for entertainment's sake.  The added scenes are poorly edited and choppily inserted.  Plus you have an annoying 'helpful' icon to tell you that what you are watching has been added.  In theory, I like the concept of the icon.  In application, I'm glad they give a choice of short or long versions because I actually prefer the short one.",1107388800,,1386,4.6460905349794235
2213062,5,B0007IF19K,"The movie is very touching, but Jamie Foxx's interpretation is what blew me away. Here are some powerful points on his acting:

1. ALL the piano playing was done by him.  So the camera goes from the quick jazz playing shot of Charles' hands to his face, on one shot, and you see it's Foxx.  The actor has been playing the piano since 3.  They couldn't have chosen a better actor.

2. In an interview with Ray Charles Jr, the son of Ray Charles, he says: ""Jamie Foxx plays my dad so well that at times I get goose bumps thinking it's my own father there...""

I guarantee that Jaime Foxx will win at least the Oscar for this movie. It showed how his life really wasn't as great as some people thought it was. He may have seemed happy a lot, but struggling with his brother's death and heroin addiction wasn't exactly a perfect life.

2213069,4,B0007IF19K,"I somehow missed this at the movies but I was determined with all the Oscar buzz and hype Jamie Foxx was receiving, that I'd buy it and form my own opinion. I have to give it up for Jamie Foxx, he just didn't play Ray Charles, he practically was Ray Charles.  His acting was just absolutely flawless.  The supporting cast of Clifton Powell, Regina King, Kelly Washington, Larenz Tate, Bokeem Woodbine, and the newcomer who played his mother (I forgot her name that quick) who's never been in anything outside of a local theatre when discovered, all did a marvelous job as well.  I was never a really big Ray Charles fan but I loved the music in the film.  However, the big disappointment for me was buying the Limited Edition version with the extended edition of the movie.  Like someone posted earlier, When viewing the ""extended"" version my player had to pause every time it went to a ""deleted scene."" It had to pause again when it went back to the theatrical version.  I have other disks in my collection which have extended versions with deleted scenes cut into the film that were done seamlessly.

Not only was there a pause when switching between versions, but many times there was a shift in color cast and certain chapters (18 & 19 for me)of the movie became unwatchable and just froze up.  For 30 Bucks I found this to be disgraceful and I will ask Best Buy for either another copy or just get the standard edition.  The special features on Disc 2 were excellent including the uncut performances that were cut short in the original film and the meeting of Foxx and Charles in a studio in 2002 to see if Foxx met Ray's approval (which it obviously did).  Foxx is not only a talented actor, but an extremely gifted pianist come to find out. The sky's the limit for this brother and I hope he comes away with the Oscar cuz his performance again was flawless.  I'd suggest buying the standard edition just to avoid all the nonsense I had to go through with extended edition.  If not for the sorry DVD transfer this would easily been a five star classic.

Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray is uncanny - it's hard to tell if you are watching Jamie or Ray himself. Jamie's mannerisms, his speech, EVERYTHING is 100% Ray Charles. This is the first time I have seen Jamie in a movie, and he did a spectacular job. I hope Jamie and Ray had a chance to sit down together before Ray passed - if they did, I'll bet they had a lot to talk about.

2213074,5,B0007IF19K,"Making a biography on anyone can sometimes be a tricky thing. But something even trickier is casting the right person in the role to really capture the subject they are documenting. Jamie Foxx, as Ray Charles, may just go down in the history books as one of the all time finest portrayals of a real person. I've seem good ones before, but I haven't seen a job thid good before in a loooong time. After watching him in the movie, you can't see him as being Jamie Foxx. You see Ray Charles. And when the movie is over, you can't see anybody as Ray Charles than Jamie Foxx. When I first saw the trailer in a ""sneak peek exlucisve"" on one of those entertianment shows, I knew right then and there that Jamie would win an Oscar. The film chronicles the life of the legend from 1948 until the mid 60's. There are flashbacks tho to his childhood strewn all thru the film, and a brief moment at the end taken place in 1979, but the majority of the sprawling film is from 1948 to about 1965. So no, it does not take on the last two decades or so of his life, or his saddening death. The film showcases the amazing and sometimes out of control life of this music pioneer. When he first went blind as a young child, to leaving home to Seattle to start his career. Ray worked in clubs, and was the piano man in bands, but always wanted to go slowly. Ray Robinson, as he was born, quickly took his middle name of Charles as his stage name, and went on the road that eventually led to super stardom. The film highlights his highs and lows, and puts together his genius as a performer/singer/musician alongside his problem areas as a philandering husband, and a man with a serious heroin addiction. Foxx is so good in his role it's scary. He has the Ray Charles mannerisms down to perfection. Ray has a distinct walk and a way he holds himself, and Jamie did it as if it were Ray himself. In fact, everything he does is as if it was Ray himself. Becuse that's who you see. Ray Charles. Not Jamie Foxx. And I think that is as big a compliment as you can give. He is utterly stunning. The good news is that the good stuff doesn't end with Foxx. He is surrounded by a strong cast who all put in noteworthy performances. Kerry Washington as his first wife, who he affectionatley called B, is wonderful. As is former ""227"" star Regina King as Margie, one of the Ray-lettes who he had an affair with and later bore one of his children. Clifton Powell is strong and steady as Jeff, Ray's good friend and partner thru many years. Larenz Tate has a small role as a very young Quincy Jones. Richard Schiff from ""The West Wing"" also appears as a producer from Atlantic records. His partner at Atlantic records is none other than ""Revenge Of The Nerds"" star Curtis Armstrong(who played Booger), who appears to have shaved his head for the role. He is not really bald. Director Taylor Hackford directs the proceedings with a firm hand. He re-creates the years and decades with impeccable accuracy. He really gets the right look, clothes, cars, mood, and music. He brings Ray and his surroundings to life. Some say there was a lot more to be told that wasn't included. The movie is two and ahalf hours long as it is. Any more stuff and the film would of been 5 hours long. Then there is the music itself. Most of Ray's most famous recordings are heard and seen when he first did them and they were first heard. Ray's music was one of a kind, and the music you hear in the picture is the real deal. Some people might not of known of Ray's real life, so the film may of come to a sort of a shock to them. But it is so painfully brave and truthful to get Ray and his story out there, that you have to stand up and salute Ray for telling it like it is. Warts and all. And for Jamie Foxx, for bringing to life an extraordinary performance of an extraordinary man. This was a good year for bio pic movies, and ""Ray"" is one of the best in a long time. May Mr. Charles and his music live on in our minds, hearts, and souls, for eternity.",1107216000,,4000,4.257555847568988

It is long and slow at times, but the music picks it right back up whenever it feels to drag. It does a great job showing how there were no limits on Ray Charles talent, and the things that kept his music and his life going.

2213078,5,B0007IF19K,"Rhythm & Blues legend Ray Charles passed away on June 10,2004 shortly after production was completed on this film. Charles definitely would have attended the premiere had he lived. It was only on October 29,2004 that this film was theatrically released and grossed five million dollars in the first week of its release. Jamie Foxx plays Charles who had been blind since early childhood. This film begins set in 1948,where we see Ray on a bus to a performance of a country and western hoedown. Ray is invited to join the band despite his blindness and no knowledge(back then) of C&W music. But in time,Ray learns about the genre which would lead to a hit recording of his,I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU which was covered by many other artists. The song was written by John Gibson and one of the many other artists to cover the song was the late Jim Reeves. This is the beginning of Ray's musical career. Ray would play in various nightclubs before signing his first recording contract. Kurt Fuller(GHOSTBUSTERS 2,WAYNE'S WORLD) plays Ray's business manager. As early as 1957,Ray would be gracing radio airwaves with hit songs like WHAT'D I SAY?. But,he'd never come close to Elvis Presley in many aspects. In 1960,his biggest hit debuted on the radio,that being GEORGIA ON MY MIND. The song was been Georgia's state song since 1979. GOMM was covered by the Righteous Brothers,Willie Nelson and Michael Bolton,to name a few artists. Bolton's cover was a Top 20 hit also. Of course,we also hear HIT THE ROAD JACK and NIGHT TIME IS THE RIGHT TIME. I first heard the latter song on a 1985 Cosby Show episode. In that episode,the Huxtable family lip-sync and dance to the song for Cliff Huxtable's parents who are celebrating 49 years of marriage. Ray's career begins to falter as he turns to drugs. He enters a rehab clinic and eventually recovers. Also from 1964 to 1979,he was banned from performing in Georgia because he refused to play for a certain audience. When GOMM became Georgia's state song,Ray was welcomed back there. This film is only a semi-autobiography since it features no post-1979 events of Charles' life. One of those events was his participation in the 1985 fund-raising recording of WE ARE THE WORLD which was written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson. Charles was one of the all-star ensemble called USA For Africa(Richie and Jackson were part of the ensemble as well). Another is a duet with Billy Joel called BABY GRAND,written by Joel. Joel was part of USA For Africa also. I dedicate this film to the memory of Charles. He was only 74 years old when he succumbed to lung cancer.",1107216000,,2597,4.773333333333333

As the movie progresses, you actually start to believe you are looking at Ray Charles.  That is because Jamie Foxx gives the performance of his life. His mannerisms, voice, and even the way he plays the piano (which he acutally does in the movie) are perfect impersinations.  The movie takes you through most of Mr. Charles big life events, and surprisingly, the director does a good job of being honest.  Ray's less flattering life choices (drugs, etc) are dealt with as much as his triumphs.  The whole fiem does very well in giving the viewer a great idea of what his life was like.  Ths movie was both happy and sad, but very moving at all times.  The whole cast, especially Jamie Foxx and the young woman who played Ray's mom in the early part of the movie, were great.

2213094,5,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx is the actor on the critics' lips. It is worthy praise? Without a doubt. Besides his resemblance to Ray Charles, Foxx embodies the man himself in essence. It is almost eerie how perfectly Foxx becomes Charles from his mannerisms, his strong but stubborn personality and his behaviour. Before seeing the film, I heard all of the hype surrounding Foxx and just thought that he would be good as Ray Charles. Good is an understatement. He was unbelievable. Even if the Oscars do not grant him his ticket to join the elite group of Sidney Poitier, Louis Gossett Jr and Denzel Washington, it doesn't matter because his performance will be remembered as a mile stone in drama.

With Foxx's potent portrayal, the supporting cast had riveting and convincing. This film is different because the whole supporting cast is great. The women of this film are wicked: Regina King (Margie, one of his many mistresses) and Kerry Washington (Della Bea) were outstanding! King and Washington had brilliant screen chemistry with Foxx, their performances had charm, wit and sheer power. Sharon Warren, a newcomer, played Ray's mother, Aretha and proved what an exceptional acting talent she is. Yet, the men of film stood on their own two feet. Famous faces such as Harry Lennix as Joe, Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet, Clifton Powell as Jeff and Larenz Tate as Quincy Jones brought a real edge to the film, equaling the female force.

It was undoubtedly going to be hard to squeeze a 40 year music career, a man's troubles, the pain and effect he had on others in 2 hours but this film works because it aims for the drama and the legend of the man, instead of a point by point narrative. While this may annoy some purists, if it was done too accurately, it would have been too long and thus relegated to the late hours of television. The cinema is the perfect platform to show the life and spirit of Ray Charles and through this, it will introduce more people to him - what could be cooler than that?

When biopics are bad, you can just feel yourself wanting to fall asleep: the incompetence of the actors becomes annoying, the predictable direction of the film from 0 to the end is boring and the tedious nature of the script leaves you feel like you want your dosh back. When biopics are good, they are like `Ray': magnificent drama, engrossing characters, beautiful music, subtle but unforced direction that makes you think.

Last Thought: Has DiCaprio seen this film yet?",1106697600,,2459,4.724941724941725
2213095,4,B0007IF19K,"There's no doubt about it.  Jamie Foxx is the reincarnation of Ray Charles.  Foxx has Ray Charles speech and mannerisms down cold.  The movie retells a portion of Ray's life during the period when he was hooked on drugs.  There was no struggle to remove drugs from his life because it wasn't until very much later in life that he finally decided to kick the habit.  His struggle to attain stardom in the early years is portrayed well by Foxx.  Along with drugs is his uncontrolable appetite for women and his affairs, before and after he was married, were many.  His wife put up with the affairs and the children born out of wedlock.

At times the movie becomes tedious as we watch Foxx contort his face and body to imitate Ray.  One gets a little weary after a while even though Foxx's portrayal is flawless.  We see the loss of his only brother and his mother sending him off to the blind school even though he didn't want to be separtated from his mother.  We learn of the demons that followed and haunted Ray all of his life.

Foxx does not sing but instead lip sincs to tracks.  A wise choice since even the best mimicks of the day have not been able to master Ray Charles voice.  Harry Lennix (The Matrix Reloaded & The Matrix Revolutions) enters the film after Ray's success as his new manager.  Lennix seems to excel at every role he touches.  His performances are always on point.  The cast in general does a good job of portraying Ray's little circle of bandmates.  If you are a Ray Charles fan you  should see this film.  Foxx just may win the Oscar with this performance.  A true test of Foxx's talents though, will be another role in which he has to act more than imitate.  Then we'll see what kind of an actor he really is.",1106524800,,1737,4.3625
2213096,3,B0007IF19K,"I saw this movie when it was first released back in September, and something gave me the feeling that this was the year that the critics and hollywood were going to blow up Jamie Foxx out of proportion. Well, they did and now Foxx has won the Golden Globe award for best actor in a musical/comedy for his performance as the late musician Ray Charles.

First of all, if you are not a fan of Charles or simply do not know who he is or was, then I presume that this film is not for you. The movie was made for Ray's fans in particular and those who appreciated his music. In modern terms for the younger generation, Ray is a long version of a Behind The Music episode on VH1, but instead of interviews, we get dramatic re-enactments of the events surrounding Charles' life from his younger years, how he became blind, rose to fame, and destroyed himself with a heroin addiction. The film successfully details these events, and does it with an eager enthusiasm. The major drive behind of the movie, however, and the true highlight of the entire story is the music. Remember, this is a movie about Ray Charles, the man who sang such classics as You Don't Know Me, Hit The Road Jack, Georgia On My Mind, and Unchain My Heart; all these songs appear in the movie.

Finally, there's the acting. To be honest, I didn't get the whole Jamie Foxx buzz (he was in Held Up for crying out loud, one of the worst films ever made). It will take Foxx the next couple of films to really prove himself, which in my opinion he won't be able to due to the fact that he really isn't the best thing I have seen on the big screen in a long time. I mean he doesn't come close to Denzel Wasington or Will Smith (who's been making some really dumb movies recently) I can't deny, however, that Foxx does an excellent impression of Ray Charles, but I don't think impressions are worthy of any best acting awards, unless of course if the actor added his own into it. If Foxx is getting all this praise, then I guess Jim Carrey should have won about 3 Oscars already, and Dave Coulier should make a comeback very soon!

2213097,5,B0007IF19K,"This film tells us the story of the first 40 years in the life of Ray Charles Robinson (1930-2004), a well-known American musician and composer. The actor that plays Ray Charles is Jamie Foxx, and sincerely, you forget that he is playing a role because after a few minutes of watching the movie you begin to believe that he IS Ray Charles. I guess that nothing better can be said in behalf of an actor...

You might be asking yourself what kind of movie is this. Well, in my opinion it is an excellent one, due to the fact that it entertains but also informs the spectator about another era, and a musician that lived in it. That is specially important in the case of young movie-goers, who aren't necessarily aware of what segregatation was like in the 50's, or what kind of gestures were needed to bring it down. You may have read about it in history books, but seeing it shown in a good film makes you understand segregation in its stark reality, and thank to God (and people like Ray, and many others) that times have changed.

But what about Ray?. Impossible as it may seem to many, some people (me included) didn't know much about him before seeing this film. If that is the case, this movie is the right way to be introduced to this American music legend, because it pictures Ray as a person with lots of virtues, but also many defects. He is shown as brave enough to overcome the difficulties that arose from the fact that he was blind and black (in times when segregation was a reality in the south of USA), and to pursue his dream of becoming a well-known musician. However, we also see his struggles with drug, and the less than stellar way in which he treated the women in his life (for example his wife, played by Kerry Washington, and his mistress, played by Regina King). He is flawed, but capable of gestures that make him great, for instance refusing to sing in places where the audience was segregated. He was somewhat self-absorbed, but he was a musical genius that created his own style and helped to develop soul music..

As we watch ""Ray"", we are allowed to accompany him in a travel through his memories, from his days as a young boy living with his mother (played by Sharon Warren), to the days when he had already achieved great fame but had many problems dealing with it. The director (Taylor Hackford) manages to do that aided by the songs Ray Charles composed at different times in his career, an interesting way to link different events of significance in Ray's life.

On the whole, I can say that this is the kind of movie you must see. If you are already a Ray Charles' fan, you will love this movie about his life. If you aren't, you are highly likely to become one. In any case, you will enjoy it enormously :)

2213098,5,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx initially broke into the business as a comedian, but he really wanted to be a singer. In ""Ray"", he gets his wish. After a stint on the shows ""In Living Color"" and ""Roc"", his own TV sitcom and appearances in several film comedies (some good, others not so good), we got to see what he was really made of. He began to be cast in dramatic roles in big-budget films like ""Any Given Sunday"", where he played an egotistical football star to the hilt. Later on we caught Foxx as Bundini Brown in ""Ali"", and he gave yet another noticeable, showstopping performance in that role. Then came his role last year in ""Collateral"" with Tom Cruise, and we just knew it: Jamie Foxx could definitely be taken seriously as an actor. He had landed the part of the late R&B pioneer and legend Ray Charles, but there were some doubters out there as to if Jamie was the right person for the role...his past in comedy came back to haunt him. But he proves the nay-sayers wrong with his amazing and unforgettable performance in this movie.

Jamie, in his role as Charles, is remarkably like Brother Ray with his mannerisms, as if he had channeled the beloved legend's spirit and brought it to life on screen. The film chronicles Ray's rise to fame, with flashbacks of his childhood, the drowning death of his little brother and how he gradually lost his vision during those years. But it doesn't shy away from his dark side, nor does it paint him as a saint, either: his growing addiction to heroin and his shabby treatment of the people closest to him (his wife, mistresses, producers and management) are a big part of this movie. It does sugarcoat and embellish some things about Ray's life in the script, but that does not take away from the fact that Taylor Hackford's direction of Jamie and this film is simply a joy to watch, and is no doubt Oscar-worthy. The supporting cast is also very strong...newcomer Sharon Warren as Ray's mom Aretha, Kerry Washington as Della Bee, Ray's wife, and veteran actress Regina King as Margie are only a few of many powerful performances to take note of.

The DVD is packed with a lot of bonus features that are also thoroughly enjoyable: numerous deleted scenes (which you have the option of seeing individually or when viewing the film in its entirety - I don't recommend it, though - the editing is poor), extended musical performances and interviews with Ray's friends and admirers, and footage of Ray and Jamie together.

Before his death in June, 2004, Ray gave Jamie his personal seal of approval to portray him in the film, and that seemed to be the motivation that Jamie used to completely envelop himself in the role. If he's good enough for Ray, then he's good enough for me. Job well done, Mr. Foxx. I'll be pulling for you to take home that Oscar.",1106265600,,2786,4.568

I had been reading and hearing about all of the ""Oscar buzz"" surrounding Foxx's performance; after seeing the film, and with his recent Golden Globe and Critics' Choice victories, the buzz sounds more like a roaring chainsaw.

The film itself is very well-done, but its Foxx's turn as Charles that elevates it from good to great.  His performance puts Jamie Foxx in an elite category of actors who literally transformed themselves into the characters they portray: Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot and Gangs of New York); Denzel Washington (Training Day); Halle Berry (Monster's Ball); Russell Crowe (The Insider); Adrien Brody (The Pianist); and, Charlize Theron (Monster).

He had some up and downs trusting people, he got married, he had some kids, he did drugs, got in trouble and recovered and beat the darkness as he became a icon.

""Ray"" allows Foxx to showcase his superb gift of mimicry for he totally immerses himself in the role of the late musical legend.  In each scene in which he is featured, the actor is not just playing a role, he IS Ray Charles.

Brilliantly supporting Foxx are Kerry Washington as long-suffering and supportive wife ""Della Bea,"" Regina King as one Charles's back-up singers, and Sharon Warren is unforgettable as Ray's mother ""Aretha.""  Aunjanue Ellis is also superb as ""Mary Ann Fisher,"" another singer that had her designs on Charles.

2213107,4,B0007IF19K,"A film by Taylor Hackford

""Ray"" is a biopic about the defining period in the life of musician Ray Charles.  While there are flashbacks to Ray's childhood, ""Ray"" mostly deals with the time between when Ray Robinson (Jamie Foxx) was first starting out in the late 1940's through the 1960's when he became a huge success with ""Georgia on my Mind"" and was the first black artist to refuse to play a venue if it was segregated.  With a ringing admonishment to never let the world treat him like a cripple, ""Ray"" begins with Ray Robinson getting onto a bus bound to Seattle from Florida and meeting up with a very young Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate).  If it didn't happen, I wouldn't believe it.  Ray Robinson gets himself an audition at a club and is immediately a hit.  The club's owner becomes his manager for a time and begins to cheat him out of his money from the start.  Time passes until Ray wises up to what is going on and leaves to strike out on his own where he can play and be more in control of his future.

""Ray"" features a series of successes where Ray Charles (Charles is the middle name of Ray Robinson, he changed his stage name because there was already a ""Sugar"" Ray Robinson who was a boxer) becomes bigger and bigger and his songs become hits and makes the record company, Atlantic, a lot of money.  Ray finds a home with his wife Della Bea (Kerry Washington) and they have a child, but Ray has demons of his own.  He keeps flashing back to his childhood where he watched his younger brother drown.  ""Ray"" does not sugarcoat the life of Ray Charles.  It chronicles how Ray got deeper and deeper into drug dependency and addiction and how he was constantly cheating on his wife when he was on the road.  ""Ray"" also gives the beautiful songs of Ray Charles a chance to shine.  I never knew that Ray had recorded ""The Mess Around"" and hearing ""Georgia on my Mind"" is sublime.  ""Ray"" follows Ray Charles through his addiction and through his rehab and we get to see him clean himself up.

To be perfectly honest, ""Ray"" runs a little long at 2 hours and 45 minutes.  I don't know what could have been cut or what scene trimmed down, but it started to feel long sometime after 2 hours but before the end.  Despite this, however, Jamie Foxx completely disappears in his role as Ray Charles.  From the first scene to the last, with the exception of one dream sequence, we are not watching Jamie Foxx doing an impersonation.  We are watching Ray Charles.  He is that good.  Everybody else in the film also does an excellent job, but Foxx is the standout and rightfully so.  He carries ""Ray"" on his shoulders and he carries it well.  What best serves this movie is the combination of Jamie Foxx's performance as well as the knowledge that the real Ray Charles had died before this film could be released in the theatres.  It is that knowing the man has only recently died that adds to the appeal and the power of ""Ray"".  Perhaps that is sad or unfair, but it is also reality.  This is not to say that ""Ray"" is not an extremely powerful movie and very well acted and well made.  It is.  But when a film is made about real life, real life affects how the film is perceived.

I was shocked to hear some of his early songs - I never knew they were his.  That combined with Jamie Foxx's excellent portrayal made me love this movie and Ray Charles.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't love the things Ray Charles did, but I feel like I got to know him.  His independence was impressive, and he was a very smart business man. If you're a fan of music, enjoy dramatic movies and like to pull for the underdog, this is the movie to see.  Great pacing, great casting and great acting.  I certainly plan to add this to my DVD collection.  Jamie Foxx should WIN best actor this year.

2213109,4,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"" is the story of Ray Charles from when, at the age of 21, he left home for Seattle to play in a lounge club to the time he gives up drugs for good about two decades later.  He starts out small, but clearly gifted.  People try to take advantage of his blindness, but he always finds a way around this, including demanding to be paid in singles.  As his star begins to rise, he finds love, drugs, and a mistress.  He even gets banned from playing in Georgia.  I knew very little about Ray Charles, and I found the details of his life (although tweaked for the movie) to be fascinating.

Jamie Foxx disappears into the character of Ray Charles.  He looks, sounds, and moves like Ray to the point where he is almost indistinguishable from the real deal.  This is his second solid performance of the year (see also ""Collateral""), and he is almost certainly guaranteed a Best Actor nomination.  His performance is what makes this movie worth seeing.  It is far superior to the movie itself, which is lacking and feels somewhat incomplete and choppy, not to mention long.  That's not to say ""Ray"" is a bad movie - it isn't.

Jamie Foxx is unbelievable fantastic as the great singer who had to overcome both racial prejudice and blindness.  Ray is no saint and his womanizing and heroin abuse are not hidden.  The man had to overcome extreme poverty, blindness, and racism.  Ray's career essentially did not begin until he was in his early thirties.  We learn about the influence of his mother in preparing him for life's challenges.  Why did Ray's wife put up with his philandering? The film didn't adequately address the reason for her not leaving him.  I also wanted to know a little more about Ray's battle against segregation.

Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles Robinson has been praised by many but frankly, like Charlize Theron's in ""Monster,"" this is more caricature than dramatic performance. Foxx's performance never feels that it comes from the gut, internalized...it's all for show. It's flawlessly copied but it's empty.

Director Taylor Hackford and his production crew have done a bang-up job with the look and feel of the movie and the musical bits are raucous and fun to hear and see.

As far as the women in Ray's life: both Kerry Washington as Ray's wife Bea and Regina King as Margie are standouts in this large cast. Both Washington and King are able to get past the title of this film and show that they are fine, truthful actresses.

Foxx's performance in the title role is moving, funny, vibrant, alive....obviously an effort (in collaboration w/ Taylor Hackford) to capture all of the man, not just the brilliant musician. RAY covers Charles' childhood through the '60s, when he finally came to grips with a debilitating drug addiction.

There's music aplenty in RAY, filmed with energy and performed with spirit by the large cast. Charles' first hit, we learn, was written by legendary Atlantic Records honcho Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) , and ""What'd I Say"" was composed on the fly onstage. My one complaint about the film was that Charles' vocals, which Foxx mimes expertly, give some of the music scenes a sepia-toned quality which undercuts the joy in the rest of the filmmaking.

Still, this is a minor quibble. There's a great deal of information about Charles' business practices, owning his own masters, refusing to play segregated shows, etc., which will come as a surprise to many people.

~REVIEW~

Who WAS Ray Charles?  What are the songs he produced?  What's his profile?  The only thing I knew about him is that he invented a new kind of music, and that he was an inspiration to many music artists everywhere.  However, with this movie that came out, those questions should be easily explained in cinema.  Not only does this movie explained the history, but it does it in soulful and energetic way that's gonna rock the Apollo theater.  The movie name says it all, and says it with respect...""Ray.""

Biography movies are synonymous in the movie industry, and almost each keep following the same chronologically approach that makes it seem effective:  Tina Turner, Selena, Nixon, and Ed Wood, the movies that were about these people's lives follow the same device.  ""Ray"" fortunately goes on a different direction, in that this movie isn't about the life and death of Ray Charles Robinson, but about how he became a huge success during all that turmoil.  From the early 50s to late 70s, he goes from working at a lowbrow bar in the South (the bar that also had WILLOW!), to having recording deals from Atlantic and ABC, to being banned from Georgia for not playing in a segregated theater.  During these events, along with other events that happened, he was crippling his life on weed and syringes, before he was arrested.

""Ray"" is great with its effective use of time-shifting.  Whenever there's a certain scene that plays an integral role, it shifts back to a past scenario when Ray was just young child living with a single ma' in a poverty area in Florida.  Each past scenario covers the inspirations on his life, and also, unfortunately for him, his tragedies, but all are just captivating to watch.  In one past scenario, Ray was just blind and when fell down in the house, he cried for his mother's help, while his mother was standing right in front of him 6 feet away, doing nothing.  From then, he started to rely on his other senses, and he got up, and experimented the sound and touch, listening to the noise of a cricket and feeling the things surrounding him.  He noticed mom from the sound of her weeping, crying because he had a special gift.  The scene was so touching, I had trouble bottling in my emotions.  The past tragedies kept robbing him out of his sanity in this movie's present and it was these devastating memories that led him to experiment drugs, damaging him in mind and body.

On the plus side, Ray is a interesting and funny fellow.  He has his way of getting attention and getting the respect he deserves.  It's funny how he also has his way with the ladies...let's just say it's all in the wrist (literally).  What a heartthrob.  Improvisation is Ray's special niche, because when he gets into a bad situation or got a problem with someone, he just turns these annoyances into song, and he made a lot of great hits improvising.  Ray taught me a good lesson:  it doesn't matter if you're blind, you're no different from the others; you're either act positive or act negative.  With Ray, this movie show him not as a blind guy with talent, but a guy with talent.

For some reason, Jamie Foxx is having his best year.  He kicked A when he's in ""Collateral"", and here, he's wonderful portraying as the recently-departed Ray Charles.  I'm surprised how a comedian like him can do so well when transitioned into drama.  He capture the stature and functionally of the icon so tightly, and he's very involved within the character's role.  Another funny thing I realized is that after watching the credits, it list some of the Ray Charles songs in which Foxx actually sang, written by the man himself.  Who knew Foxx had the soul of a singer in him?  While I can remember their names, the remaining cast were all great too.  Like every biography of its type, ""Ray"" includes the original songs, and Ray Charles's songs, such as ""What`d I Say"" and ""Hit the Road Jack"", really brought in some validity to this film.

THE FINAL WORD: Astonishing.  I first had no interest in ""Ray"" since it's already been critically-acclaimed and I thought this wouldn't really leave me much of what's already been criticized.  My god, how come I didn't see this sooner?  Other than a few editing mistakes ""Ray"" was a flaw-less true-story movie: it was funny, it left me in tears, it was full of character and optimism.  This is possibly the best film I've seen in 2004, and I hope this movie deserves an Oscar nomination; it's also one of those rare black drama cinemas that actually make me feel good instead of feeling depressed.  If the inventor of soul was alive right now, he probably would've been amazed by this tribute.

You did good, Jack.  You did good.",1100736000,,4897,4.59284890426759
2213127,5,B0007IF19K,"I've never been much of a Ray Charles fan (which makes me nekulturny, I guess), but I do know an Oscar-winning performance when I see one. RAY has one at least, perhaps several.

Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles Robinson, the truly great American musician and composer, and RAY depicts his professional career and personal trials from 1948, when he left Florida at age 18 on a bus for Seattle, to the late 60s when he kicked a heroin habit. The film is interspersed with numerous flashbacks to his boyhood in Georgia, where, at age 5, he was psychologically scarred by the tragic drowning of his younger brother in a washtub, and where, by age 7, glaucoma rendered him completely blind.

I would've been even more impressed with Foxx's role had he been the one singing the Ray Charles songs sprinkled throughout the film, much as Sissy Spacek sang Loretta Lynn's hits in the memorable COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER (1980). However, Jamie's lip-synch was seamless, and he certainly had Ray's mannerisms down. The viewer can be excused for forgetting that it wasn't actually Charles up there on the Big Screen, and Foxx deserves a Best Actor Oscar nomination if there's any justice to the awards process.

There are at least two performances worthy of an Academy nod for Best Supporting Actress: Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Ray's on-the-road mistress that inspired the passion which fueled many of his musical compositions, and Sharron Warren as Aretha Robinson, Ray's mother. I wish we could have seen more of the latter. Aretha had fire.

In any story of someone transcending poverty to attain fame, usually an entertainer or athlete, there's usually the two-hanky bit where the star returns home to buy Mom a new house or some such. There's no indication in the film that Ray visited Aretha after he left Florida. This may be a puzzle unless the viewer is aware that Aretha died when Ray was 15, something RAY fails to note. Also, the film's conclusion infers that Charles lived happily ever after with his long-suffering wife, Della Bea (Kerry Washington). In fact, Ray and Della divorced in 1977. And my only other niggling objection was the genesis of the song ""Hit the Road, Jack"". As portrayed, it brought forth laughter from the audience; I think it was intended by the scriptwriters and director to be a powerfully dramatic sequence.

RAY is arguably 2004's Best Picture. It's certainly a must-see for any consumer of contemporary cinema, and an absolutely obligatory-see for any fan of Ray Charles.",1100563200,,2497,4.8936170212765955
2213128,3,B0007IF19K,"The rating should be about 3.5 stars. First I would like to say that Jaime Foxx gave a performance of his life in this movie. He managed to captured the physical behavior of Ray Charles without trying to mimic him. That is a hard thing to do for an actor. Foxx's performance is probably the best I have seen this year and definitely lightyears ahead of anyone else. The music and sound of the movie was also a winner. Foxx captured Ray Charles superbly well in all aspects.

Having wrote all that, why wasn't this movie rated ""five""? Well, just because the actor is fantastic, doesn't make the film that way. Ultimately, this movie was downer for me. Take away Ray Charles' genius and talent for music and this is what you have: a drug addict, a bad and faithless husband, lousy father and fair-weathered friend. His ambition made him self driven but at the same time, self-centered. In this movie without his music, Ray Charles was one miserable human being. I am sure Ray Charles did more during the Civil Right movement then just refusing to played for a Jim Crow concert in Georgia. The movie didn't focus on any of his positive aspects outside of his music. Didn't he had any positive aspects personally?? I supposed at the end of the movie when he finally kicked the heroin addiction, he became a better man to his family, friends and to himself but we don't get to see how he evolved. Non-musical aspects of the movie dealt with his negatives, even the flashbacks scenes showing Ray Charles as a boy exactly don't help as if it was creating an excuse why Ray is such a lousy guy outside of his music. The movie was repetitive with scenes of Ray cheating on his wife, taking drugs and using up loyal friends. It was rather one dimensional in that aspect.

But its still a good film, Jaime Foxx's performance glued you to that theater seat. Even during the ""slow and dragging"" parts of the film of which there were quite a few, Foxx's performance was good enough to keep you from yawning. Can this get him the Oscar nomination? It should and a win to go with it!!",1100476800,,2068,4.482758620689655
2213129,5,B0007IF19K,"This film runs a lot like Oliver Stone's 1991 ""The Doors"", starring Val Kilmer. Kilmer's transformation into Jim Morrison was considered to be one 1991's best performances, as well as one of the best musical dramas ever made. I've never been so blown away by a transformation of character, until I saw ""Ray"".

Jamie Foxx's role as Ray Charles is in no way an impersonation. Foxx's looks, emotions, voice, speech, movements, etc. are so dead on, that you can actually believe that he (Jamie Foxx) is performing all of these songs. Jamie Foxx's performance of ""Ray Charles"" is often times more interesting than what Taylor Hackford's conveys through his story, really making the script come to life.

I've never been a huge fan of Jamie Foxx. But after seeing ""Ray"", I've found a new found respect for him, and his character of Ray Charles. I went into the theater knowing virtually nothing about Ray Charles, minus the old Pepsi commercials, and came out understanding and reflecting on the genius and legend of Ray Charles.

2213130,4,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx brilliantly expands upon the accolades he earned this past summer with an especially convincing role in ""Collateral"" with Tom Cruise. Many were astonished at learning of Foxx's versatility as he blew the doors off of his comedic roots and became one of the most talented actors on the scene today. Foxx's riveting portrayal of Ray Charles -- utterly believable from first frame to last -- is bolstered by a script that refuses to look away from the flaws in the character of an American icon. ""Ray"" boldly examines both Charles's compassion and his cold-heartedness, his addiction to beauty as well as to poison, his casual womanizing despite his wife's obvious devotion and strength, and the penchant Charles had for burning bridges. These are narrative threads that run through the lives of many people who have walked paths similar to Charles, and if the script therefore comes across as cliched, I do not think it is the writer's fault. These stories are simply the truth, and that we are familiar with them does not make them less so. Even though some of the film moves too quickly and conveniently -- as in the whirlwind romance that abruptly explodes between Charles and his future wife -- the film's fundamental commitment to the facts makes this one of the most refreshing biographical studies Hollywood has turned out in ages. it makes ""Hurricane"" and ""Ali"" look like fairytales. Most importantly, though, this is a wildly enjoyable film jam-packed with phenomenal music and memorable performances by Foxx himself as he so smoothly lip-synchs Charles's vocals.",1100476800,,1581,5.038167938931298
2213131,4,B0007IF19K,"Taylor Hackford's ""Ray"" is an often riveting, wonderfully acted biopic centered by Jamie Foxx's extraordinary turn as a great American original, Ray Charles. To play a public figure who is so idiosyncratic in appearance and manner, and so fresh in the public memory, is the thespian equivalent of taming lions: if you don't get eaten by the role, the performance is considered a success. Foxx not only doesn't get devoured, he saddles up the lion and rides it around the arena. He captures Charles' vocal and physical mannerisms perfectly, but even more, he shows us the complicated, tortured inner life of a man who battled tragedy from his earliest days. This isn't an impression of Charles, but a full-blooded, three-dimensional performance by a master actor. I can think of only one previous performance that compares with it: Kurt Russell's performance as Elvis Presley in John Carpenter's 1979 TV-movie. And Foxx enjoys one enormous advantage over Russell: whereas Carpenter's film was pretty much a whitewash of Elvis, Hackford's portrait of Charles is warts-and-all, allowing Foxx ample access to Charles' dark side. The music is wall-to-wall, as you would expect, and since it's Charles' own singing and playing mimed by Foxx, it's the best. Yet despite the film's length and detail, it feels incomplete and slightly bitter at the end, glossing over Charles' last four decades with a few captions and some brief footage of Charles himself in his later years. We get closure as to one of Charles' major problems (heroin addiction) but not as to others (his compulsive womanizing and often callous treatment of lovers, family and friends). It makes us feel that what the movie doesn't show us must have been REALLY awful! But this deficiency in the movie can't be laid at Foxx's door. Though Foxx is a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination, there are plenty of other Oscar-worthy performances in the film, particularly by the women: Sharon Watkins as Charles' mother; Kerry Washington as his long-suffering wife, Della Bea; and Regina King and Aunjanue Ellis as women who shared a bed as well as a stage with Charles. I must also put in a good word for young C.J. Sanders, who gives a tremendously skillful and touching performance as the seven-year-old Ray.",1100390400,,2259,5.026666666666666

2213133,5,B0007IF19K,"I went to see Ray in the theaters last night because my sister suggested it and because I was in a mood to see something ""critically acclaimed"".  For the record, I knew very little about the man and so had very few preconceptions.  What I saw made a deep impression in my mind and heart.

Ray Robinson, aka Ray Charles the singer, songwriter and musician, was blind since the age of 7.  He had to deal not only with bigotry for his disability but for being black in Georgia before the civil rights movement.  Throughout his life many people (both black and white) would try to take advantage of the blind man, ripping him off financially or  hoarding his talent for their own gain. Ray had both the blessing and the curse of being a ladies' man, resulting in serial affairs while his wife stayed home and raised their family.  It surprised me to learn that he fought an addiction to heroin for well over a decade before finally beating it in the `60s.  Nevertheless, Ray carried all this baggage and more through the 40s and 50s as he made a name for himself playing piano in the Country, Jazz, etc. pop music circuits.  Eventually of course he rose to become one of the most recognized and beloved musical artists worldwide.

The man that this film showed me was an incredible example of determination, charm and simple human spirit.  I have heard others say that Jamie Foxx's acting was so good that they were half-convinced he was channeling Ray Charles' ghost.  I'll take their word for it that it was an accurate performance, but regardless, it was also a great performance!  Down the line each of the supporting actors was perfectly convincing and real, but none more so than Foxx.  I will denounce the Academy if he isn't at least nominated for an Oscar.

The least of Ray's imperfections was his physical blindness --yet he had a powerful gift and the ability to reach into the collective soul of a nation. Over his long career as a musician and songwriter, Ray Charles Robinson created and performed some of the most memorable music to audiences across the country.  Your color, age and creed doesn't matter; chances are, you've heard and loved at least one Ray Charles song in your lifetime.  We'll never have another like him.

2213135,4,B0007IF19K,"""Ray,"" Taylor Hackford's new movie based on the life of the great Ray Charles, is a strange blend.  I liked some aspects of this film very much.  Other parts gave me a bad case of the biopic blues.

The flashbacks that depict Ray's childhood as a poor, fatherless boy living in Florida with his mother and his brother are wrenching and heartbreaking.  Sharon Warren, as Ray's mother Aretha, is a standout.  She is a formidable individual who rejects self-pity and never allows Ray to feel sorry for himself, even after he loses his sight.  CJ Sanders, as young Ray, has an incredibly expressive face that speaks volumes.  I also admired the beautiful Kerry Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife, Della Bea, a woman who stands by her man, although he betrays her time and time again.

By now, most people know that Jamie Foxx will probably be Oscar nominated for his uncanny, dead-on performance as Ray Charles.  Foxx exhibits all of Charles's physical quirks and captures the nuances of his personality, including his unique musical genius, tremendous ambition, manipulative and predatory behavior towards the women in his life, and his self-destructive drug habit.  For every moment of this film, Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  Period.  The glorious music of Ray Charles permeates the film and I still can't get ""Hit the Road Jack"" out of my head.

There were other portions of this film that irritated me.  Taylor Hackford bears much of the blame for some of the clunky and heavy-handed lines, and the absurd, over-the-top sequences that seem to spring straight out of a forties movie.  The worst of these are the ""Aha!"" moments when Charles suddenly gets an inspiration out of nowhere, and his producers all sit around grinning from ear to ear, agreeing that this is the sound that will make them all rich.  There is too much foreshadowing and melodrama, and the direction and cinematography sometimes lack the subtlety that would have made ""Ray"" a truly great movie.

Ray Charles had a gift almost beyond human capacity: he could imerse himself in any genre of music; his deep emotions being the impetus to the style he took on at the different stages of his life. You become privy to the full force behind each song and style. His back up vocalists were front and center in his life and style.

Due to his blindness, many took unfair advantage. But Ray Charles was smart and picked up on things others couldn't. In the end, he made his own way, on his own terms with his own strength of character.

Let me also address the music. The songs were beautifully done. The background scenes highlighted the themes of the songs without flaw and were staged for full impact of each era.

Jamie Foxx is brillant as Ray.  If you are surprised by his performance here, don't be.  He has managed to make every film I've seen him in watchable and in this one, he is mesmerizing.  And he is not alone in turning in a fine performance.  Ray is loaded with them, from Sharon Warren's exceptional performance as Ray's mother Aretha, to Kerry Washington's fine performance as Della Bea, Ray's wife.  Last but not least, Regina King's performance burns with an intensity that jumps off the screen as Margie, Ray's favorite ""Ray Lette.""  Ms. King has always been a presence, even in small roles and in this one, she goes for it and lets it all out.  Taylor Hackford is a director who manages to get the best out of his actors and it is the acting and the music of Ray Charles that truly shines in this film.  I saw Ray last night and this film has haunted me all day long, it is so deeply felt. If this isn't a big winner at the Oscars, Hollywood needs to stop giving the award out.  This is Academy Awarding acting at its finest.  A CLASSIC!",1099785600,,1491,4.259786476868327
2213155,3,B0007IF19K,"Most films in the biopic genre follow the same conventional formula: modest beginnings and/or scarring experience, growing popularity, ultimate success, ultimate downfall, personal and public redemption, then a little piece about how the subject affected his or her society.  In a year full of biopics about influential men --Howard Hughes, Cole Porter, Alfred Kinsey, Bobby Darin, and, here, Ray Charles-- one would hope at least one or two of these films would transcend the genre and stand as one of 2004's better films.  'Ray' does not do so and disappoints in its formulaic, dull portrayal of a man whose music was famed for being consistently groundbreaking, moving, and inspiring.

Though Ray Charles' life may be able to be captured within such a basic formula as previously mentioned, there are so many details of Charles' personal arc we do not see crystallized.  'Ray,' a lengthy film, moves along at a quick, choppy pace, shifting focus from event to event.  What we see is a montage of performances and recording sessions cataloging Charles' musical history.  But under the direction of Taylor Hackford ('Devil's Advocate'), this desultory recollection of instances where American history and performance interweave actually weaken the film: the musical sequences are often so enthralling we disregard the boring calm of 'Ray's thin emotional tale (further weakened by a failed, uninteresting attempt to connect Ray's drug addiction with the death of his younger brother, which results in an overly-melodramatic, cliched ending).

What is seen in between is your basic sob story of a man who loses himself in drugs and adultery while the ""long-suffering wife"" (Kerry Washington, doing well with what she's given) waits at home alone with children, watching the man she loves transform into a burden.  Of course, she stays home as it grows larger and larger as her husband's career does the same.  Of course, she feels lonely.  And of course, she stands by him.  The problem is that any emotional foundation found in the dumbed-down valleys wears thin because of its familiarity: it is not allowed to move beyond the basic troubled musician story, and in turn fails to elicit concrete feeling.  Luckily, 'Ray' is full of strong performances to keep its audience awake during the trouble spots.

Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles gives the film's strongest performance.  His acting is kinetic, moving with a force that both captures the real-life Charles' spirit and easily identifiable mannerisms while also exploring the inner being of the man and his struggles with being blind, an adulterer, and a heroin addict.  Sometimes, his performance is borderline impersonation, but maintains enough control to never fully cross the line into dangerously bland territory.  Regina King as Charles' most frequent on-the-road mistress, Margie (one of the Raelettes), also gives a stand-out performance that manages to be at once dimensional and enthralling.

Perhaps 'Ray's most underrated performance is Sharon Warren's as Ray's mother, Aretha Robinson.  Her character is forced to come to terms with one of her sons' death and another's worsening blindness.  Warren maintains a strength and wisdom that grows endearingly realistic.  She should be considered for an Oscar nomination, but probably will not have the chance she deserves considering her lack of name recognition and screen-time.

Collectively, these performances, in addition to strikingly visceral music and a creative flash-back sequence, redeem the film from being complete dreck.  While the film unevenly refers back to Charles' era and growing popularity, Hackford refrains from fully penetrating the psyche of Charles as a human being, and we never fully understand what drives him to create as passionately as he does.  However, though I found most of the film to be uninvolving (I nearly fell asleep three or four times), some fans of Ray Charles and his music will love 'Ray' no matter the flaws, as it does cram (awkwardly, mind you) most of his life into the running time; perhaps that is an act of appreciation.  I believe it is an unwise decision that plagues the modern biopic, hindering any chance at breaking convention and exciting the masses the way the men and women the genre focuses on did in their time, discovering, creating, and uplifting; 'Ray' does none of those things and left me curiously unsatisfied.",1099612800,,4390,5.220797720797721
2213156,5,B0007IF19K,"Jamie Foxx is unbelievable in this role!  He doesn't just portray Ray Charles, he becomes Ray.

And on top of that the music was inspiring.  It made me feel like I was getting to see Ray- an experience I never got to have.

The performances in this movie were a mile higher than outstanding!  So convincing, I thought it truly was Ray Charles that I was watching.

2213159,5,B0007IF19K,"""Ray"" is a great film.  I must say that the film does follow the standard formula of the Hollywood biography pic, but it is the performances that raise this move from simply very good to great--even outstanding.  It is as if every actor in the film realized this was the opportunity of a lifetime and brought their A game, and based on the way Hollywood treats Black actors, they were right to do so!  Jamie Foxx is a revelation as Ray Charles.  I cannot even imagine there being another performance this year to match this one.  It truly deserves to go down in history as one of the greatest screen achievements in film.  It is true that you forget that you are even watching Jamie Foxx...he is that awesome.  The Oscar is as good as his!!

That said, I also want to spend some time heralding the other actors in this film.  Sharon Warren, in her film debut, is superb as Ray's mother.  Warren captures the spirit of this determined woman with a mix of grit, vulnerability and compassion.  She and the little boy who plays Ray as a youngster, C. J. Samuels, are both heartbreakingly good!  Clifton Powell is fantastic as Ray ever loyal assistant, and Bokeem Woodbine has never been better than he is as Fathead Newman.  I wish we could have seen more of the youthful vigor and energy that Larenz Tate brings to the role of Quincy Jones.  Aunjanue Ellis is also very effective as one of Ray's mistresses, Mary Ann Fisher.

Kerry Washington is fabulous as Della Bea, Ray's long suffering and put-upon wife.  The scene when she explains to Ray that their newborn son is not a gift from her to him and how his life on the road must not find its way in the home she is making for their family is powerful and the scene when Ray tells her of the death of Margie Hendrix is just as stunning.  Washington is an incredible actress and ""Ray"" lets her shine!

Finally, there aren't enough words to champion the vastly underrated Regina King.  Her name MUST be called with Jamie Foxx's the day Oscar nominations are announced in January.  Her Margie Hendrix is a blistering hybrid of passion, weakness, love and compassion, and every emotion is firmly etched on King's face.  The ""Hit the Road Jack"" scene is so raw and painful, and King matches Foxx's performance emotion for emotion, word for word, pain for pain, blues for blues.  Regina King is a miracle worker, and it is high time she is acknowledged for the incredible work she is contributing to American film.  Please remember this performance at Oscar time!!!!!

Please see ""Ray.""  All of the actors in the film deserve your support.  They have truly thought enough of us, the film going public, to give their very, very, very best!!!",1099440000,,2683,4.560669456066946
2213160,5,B0007IF19K,"How to make a movie about a legend like Ray Charles? Hard to walk the line between a maudlin soap and a superficial celebrity tell-all.

Somehow, the makers of this movie found the right balance.

I was surprised at what a wonderful job Jamie Foxx did--just never thought of him as a great actor. His performance of Ray suffering through heroin withdrawal was wrenching. I noticed in the closing credits that most of the musical performances were dubbed by Ray Charles's own recordings, but some of the performances were sung by Jamie Foxx himself; darned if I could tell the difference!

As far as biopics go, I felt this movie had considerable depth. They did not gloss over how Ray treated his family and his drug problems, yet they treated him respectfully with some understanding of the pressures and tragedy of his childhood that led him to do the things he did. Foxx did a great job at making the character appealing despite his flaws. I'll admit I pulled out my hanky for a couple of tearful moments near the end. I left the theater feeling uplifted. I'd like to see it again.

Powerful performances by some of the supporting cast: Sharon Warren (a beautiful woman), playing Ray's mother, created a beautiful portrait of a poor but proud woman who stood up for herself. Ray went blind at the age of 7, but his mother forced him to stand on his own two feet and to take life on his own terms. ""Promise me you'll never let anyone make you a cripple!""

Recognize one of the Atlantic Records executives, Jerry Wexler? He's Richard Schiff (Toby) from TV's West Wing. Looks a little different with hair and no beard!

Tremendous performance from Kerry Washington as Ray's wife--a strong and proud woman who rises above Ray's road romances.

On a technical note, the production design of the movie was superb. Cars,  clothes, furniture, houses, were very accurate for the 40s, 50s, and 60s. The color correction was designed to give everything an over saturated, soft look that reminded me of early color home movies. I'm sure this was quite intentional--perhaps to subtly place the movie in time or perhaps to unify modern scenes with the flashbacks to Ray's childhood which were EXTREMELY over saturated to the point of surrealism, which might be the case if a blind man remembered scenes from when he was a small child when he could still see color.",1099440000,,2353,4.708029197080292
2213161,2,B0007IF19K,"....but the film is subpar, TV fare. While much has been made of Jamie Foxx's performance, the fact is, he teeters between comedy and being an outright minstrel. The strongest supporting role accolades go to the underrated Clifton Powell as longtime road manager/assistant Jeff, the man who keeps Ray grounded and in touch with his morals and obligations. As I stated before, the music is timeless and never goes out of style and a documentary about the man and his creative process would have served his legacy better than this fodder, but since audience expectations are so low and the Oscar race/hype machine has to start somewhere, ""RAY"" is as good a place as any.

2213163,5,B0007IF19K,"What a singularly fabulous film.

Sitting through this movie, you forget that someone is playing the role of Ray Charles. In an Oscar-worthy performance (and there were a number of others in this biopic), Jamie Foxx BECAME Ray Charles, much the same way Charlize Theron nailed her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wournous in ""Monster.""

The major difference of course, being that, despite his faults, Charles was a brilliant and talented individual who is sorely missed. ""Monster"" might have been a great movie, but it was disturbing to watch. ""Ray"" on the other hand, is a great movie that, despite being nearly 2 1/2 hours in length, simply breezes past... and you're almost sorry to see the credits roll at the end.

Other stellar performances include Sharon Warren, who plays Ray's mother, Aretha Robinson. She steals almost every scene she's in... and a quick check on IMDB.com reveals that this is her ONLY film (so far!). I'm guessing we'll see her again.

Kerry Washington does a superb job portraying Ray's wife, Della Bea Robinson. It's another award-worthy performance.

You'll laugh. You'll cry. You won't be able to sit still in your seat. Get out there and enjoy what will likely go down as one of, (if not THE) best films of 2004.

Oh. And take a careful look at Ahmet Ertegun, the Atlantic Records executive. If you think you've seen him before but you can't place the face... think ""Revenge of the Nerds"" or ""Risky Business.""

2213165,4,B0007IF19K,"Ray is an excellent musical biography of the late, talented Ray Charles.  I enjoyed this film immensely and was impressed by the entire production from the superb performances of Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and the underrated Regina King to the realistic costumes and art direction and beautiful cinematography.

I was also impressed with director Taylor Hackford's choice to balance Ray's personal tragedies and personal life with his music careers.  Many musical biographies tend to focus more on the personal side, but 'Ray' lets us into business meetings, contract discussions, label changes and in this film makes  Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler important characters in the film.  I also liked how the film addressed the groundbreaking musical choices Ray made without being heavy handed.

Jamie Foxx should win the Oscar.  He really deserves it.  I also hope Kerry Washington, Regina King, and Sharon Warren (who plays Ray's mother, Aretha) are nominated too because their performances are just as integral to the film because Ray was certainly not a perfect person as the film shows, and their characters each bring out a different side in Ray, and the actors each bring a different side out of Jamie Foxx.

One of the most moving scenes in the film is when Ray's character is a child and learns to cope with being blind, while his mother observes.  It is one of the most striking scenes in film this year.

The Academy Awards should make an exception, and award Jamie Foxx with an Oscar at this time. This movie is destined to be a classic. As soon as the DVD comes out, I'll be buying one.

Ray Charles put Jamie Foxx through the paces, and was very pleased with Foxx and gave his blessings in portraying him on the big screen.

Jamie Foxx and the supporting cast have made the movie of a lifetime. What a quintessential performance by Jamie Foxx!!!

2213168,4,B0007IF19K,"RAY is one of the more media-hyped movies of the year with Oscar predictions all over the ads.  It is always with some misgivings that these movies are visited, admittedly with some resentment that they are pre-judged before a personal opinion can be made.  Such is the case for Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.  Not that his performance isn't excellent in this movie: the media would have us believe it is the first time this gifted actor has demonstrated his mettle, and that only means that too many folks have forgotten Foxx's powerful performances in such films as COLLATERAL earlier this year.

RAY is a Hollywood-style biography and for this reviewer that hampers the story.  Too much attention is paid to the mannerisms of Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx just isn't given enough screen time away from his band and his audience to let us understand why he is an American icon:  it would have been so much richer had we been given insights as to Ray Charles' innovative impact on popular music - the origins, the attempts, the failures, and the successes and why.  Still in all Foxx is in fine form lip-synching Charles' terrific music, writhing in withdrawal from his heroin addiction, and especially showing us the personal tragedy when he hears the news of his lover's death with his wife observing the crushing blow.

Which leads to what is the most sensitive aspect of this movie: the women.  Sharon Warren as Ray's poverty-surviving mother is radiant and gives a performance that is overwhelmingly beautiful.  Likewise, Kerry Washington as Bea, Ray's long-suffering yet enduring wife shows us one of the finer supporting roles of the year to date.  And that leaves Regina King as Ray's lover Margie, another of the strong female supporting roles in the film.

But by far the 'star' of the film is the music of Ray Charles that is played intact and is simply wonderful on every level.  If all the rest of the film existed merely as background for these great moments in music, that would be sufficient.  With a bit more judicious editing by Director Taylor Hackford this could have been an even better film.  Grady Harp, October 2004",1099094400,,2147,4.796195652173913

Fox is excellent in his role as Ray Charles.  From what I can remember seeing of Mr Charles on tv, Fox has the mannerisms down to a T.

As for the movie itself it covers Ray Charles early part of his career from the 40s to the mid to late 60s.  The movie doesnt whitewash his womanizing and his drug addiction problem but makes it part of the story of his success.  There are flashbacks within the movie that show his life as the son of a florida sharecropper and his becoming blind in his youth.

The supporting cast is excellent and the sets work well with the period but the big thing is the music.  I didn't realize that many of the songs that were sung by Ray Charles although I knew them, like ""hit the road jack"" and ""What you say""

2213170,4,B0007IF19K,"It was tremendously heart-breaking for America to have lost not only one, but two cultural icons that had had profound impacts on the people of our nation - Ronald Reagan and Ray Charles - die within a week of each other. Unfortunately, Ray Charles' sudden passing, which occurred on June 10th, was slightly over-shadowed by the funeral processions of the late-president, but he was hardly forgotten, nor will he ever be thanks to the landmark impact he left, not only on his own, but on the current generation of artists as well. There are certainly substantial arguments over the current direction that many believe the music industry is heading toward at this moment in time but what can be said, together, is that Ray Charles will be forever remembered for leaving an influential mark on the music industry and broke barriers in order for the current generation of supposedly ""musically inclined"" teen-poppers to express their own voice in the world today.

The story charts the life and career of the pioneering musical sensation Ray Charles, who passed away this past summer at the age of seventy-four after primary production had been completed on the biography. Born in a poor black neighborhood of Albany, Georgia in 1930, Ray Charles Robinson never imagined the extraordinary life he would lead, but it wouldn't come easy for either him or his family and not without heavy costs in return. After the accidental death of his younger brother, Ray began to go blind starting at the age of seven and his mother, a fiercely independent and strong black woman, helped him develop his other abilities in order to better adapt to his changing environment. Ray's true gift lied with his ability to take ordinary gospel and jazz music and turn it into something spectacular, as was demonstrated by the unprecedented number of his hits he obtained in an astounding number of genres, practically unthinkable for a musician in his day. Despite marrying a beautiful former singer and having two children as well as all the wealth and fame he could have ever imagined, Ray Charles for years battled with his inner demons, including his excessive womanizing while on the road and his growing heroin addiction, as well as the psychotic side effects that haunted him for years and nearly ended the long standing career he had fought so hard for. The story for Ray should be commemorated for doing what so few bio-pictures have actually done, which is to tell the whole story, including the good times, the bad, and the down-right ugly, and unfortunately the latter may be the reason the feature's rating gets knocked down a few notches in the end. It's important that Ray Charles' incessant heroin addiction and womanizing are the primary focus of the film, as they were the demons that consumed a large portion of his life and career, but after about two hours it becomes a little depressing. This is hardly a call-to-arms for the ""hippie-dippy"" view of Mr. Charles' life story but it would have been nice had some time been set aside to look at the events of his life ranging from the mid-1970s to the time of his death in the summer of 2004.

As is so often the case with biographical features, don't be expecting a star-studded cast - the primary focus is, and always should be, the story's main component and nothing should distract from that, which remains true for this one as well. Let's end the discussion here and now. The votes have already been tallied up - Forget those damn recounts, honestly if people don't know how to properly fill out an election ballot in this day and age then they deserve what-ever they get -  The winner for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards will be Jamie Foxx. To be true, Foxx was cheated out of a golden-statuette for his role in the critically-acclaimed comedy Booty Call but with this one practically in the bag, all is forgiven to be sure. Seriously, Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a life-time as the legendary Ray Charles and, considering he spent numerous hours with the man himself prior to his death, nothing he does in the film seems off-key or out of place. This is one of those rare occasions in the history of cinema where witnessing a film is called for principally for the sake of one actor's astonishing performance and Foxx's take on the late-Ray Charles is it. One can picture Kerry Washington's Della Bea Robinson, the wife of Ray Charles, in comparison to Jacqueline Kennedy, another spouse of a famous figure of American culture whose ""dabbling"" in the areas of drugs and women severely affected life back home. She works well with the limited screen time she's given but one has to remember that the primary focus should be on Ray specifically, so it was expected that less time would be spent on the supporting characters. And Sharon Warren, who is an apparent newcomer to the Hollywood scene according to IMDB, does an incredible job with the role of Ray's fiercely independent mother, Aretha Robinson, and reflects perfectly a woman struggling to go through life in a world she is well aware is far from fair, having her youngest son unexpectedly taken away from her and raising a blind child alone in a poor southern neighborhood. She quickly adapts her experience in life and embeds them in the young Ray in order to prevent others from treating him merely as a cripple. Unfortunately what Ray forgets along the way is that it isn't others he should be concerned about treating him as anything other then a blind-black man, it should be himself as well.

Overall, Ray, in the same captivating way as the inspirational artist on which it is based, breaks away from the conventional norms, too often tied down by an over-burdening sense of political correctness, and drastically alters the way we look at the biography genre. As instrumental as the feature may be, it does have its fair share of problems that hinder it enough to prevent a spectacular rating from being given to it. First off, an annoying aspect of the feature was Hackford's constant use of flashbacks to Ray's early childhood in Albany, Georgia during the middle of several scenes throughout the movie. It would have been better had Hackford played the story of Ray Charles straight-up instead of having to resort to using ridiculous, and repeatedly awkward, flashbacks that frequently distract the audience from the current conflicts as hand. With a running time of slightly over two hours and thirty minutes, director Taylor Hackford seems to be biting off more then he can chew and gives the audience the feeling as though he is cramming too much into one film. The flow of the film may have been better had he given the thought of chopping a few unnecessary sequences in order to shorten it up a bit. And finally, the less then spectacular finale to the musical biography leaves something desperately to be desired. Giving benefit to the doubt due to the fact that Ray Charles died shortly after primary shooting had been completed on the film, the filmmakers may have been confused as to how to properly end the feature now that he had passed away. It doesn't give them a total free-pass for ending it as flatly as they did but it is, at the very least, understandable. There are, ultimately, two distinct factors that should convince you to see this film - its rocking soundtrack and the astonishing performance of comedian Jamie Foxx. The soundtrack, though, should be disqualified since anyone can just as easily purchase it either on a compact disc or download it offline (a free version was available on AOL Music at the time of this publishing) but Foxx's breakthrough performance is unlike anything seen in years and should be seen for yourself to be thoroughly convinced. Despite some minor squabbles with particular methods used by the filmmakers, it is to be sure that Ray Charles is looking down on this film at this moment and giving it, as well as the talented cast and crew who worked diligently to make this as truthful and entertaining as possible, his blessing.",1099094400,,8021,4.793352601156069
2213171,5,B0007IF19K,"This is a very good movie that houses an exceptionally great performance by Jamie Fox as music legend Ray Charles.  I must confess that as a genre, the biopic is not my favorite, especially of figures as well known as Ray Charles.  We usually receive in such films distorted portraits of them, or undeserved adulation.  RAY is one of the more balanced biopics I have seen.  Ray Charles is presented as a musical genius who had managed to overcome physical disabilities that would have stopped most others, but it doesn't attempt to mute the serious and unflattering personal moral problems he had with drugs and his exploitative treatment of women.  Nor is he revealed as a moral saint or loving person.  Though pleasant with others for the most part, Ray is shown as a proud, independent, and slightly self-absorbed, a bit selfish in his treatment of women.  As a result, Ray Charles emerges in the film as a believable human being, capable of unfortunate decisions, but also extraordinary music and the occasional powerful moral stand, such as when he refuses to perform in a racially segregated crowd in a venue in Georgia.  In fact, the film is built around three foci:  his early childhood when he witnessed the death of his younger brother and gradually lost his sight; his musical career from 1948 until the mid-1960s; and his heroin addiction.  The film ends with his overcoming his heroin addiction, which also-as numerous music critics have noted--corresponds to the end of the peak of his career as a creative musical performer.  Charles continued to make albums after getting off heroin, but all of the great songs that we associate with him were written and recorded while on heroin.  For the last forty years of his career, his sets consisted almost entirely of songs he made famous in the fifties and early sixties, with covers of songs by other musicians.  There has been a long debate as to whether his addiction somehow aided his musical creativity, but even if so, no one would have wished him to continue to endanger his health and life.

Jamie Fox will without any possible doubt receive an Oscar nomination for this performance.  This is considerably more than a good impersonation of Charles:  it is almost as if Fox channels him.  As much as I loved other biopics of music legends like THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY or WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, throughout each I was conscious that Gary Busey was playing Buddy Holly and Angela Bassett playing Tina Turner.  I completely forgot that Jamie Fox was playing Ray Charles, and despite being quite familiar with him, imagined that I was actually watching Charles onscreen.  Yes, he does a killer impersonation of Charles, but he manages that first on top of that provides an amazing dramatic performance.  This is great acting, not merely a great impersonation.  The only performance of recent years of an actor portraying a prominent entertainer as superb as this is Robert Downey in CHAPLIN.

I also really loved the look of the film.  Since it ended in the mid-1960s, the entire film was essentially a period film.  There was a sense of visual veracity from beginning to end.  I loved the cars, the clothes (especially the ties! - am I alone in thinking that the 1950s was the great decade for neckties?), the interior decors, the furniture.  The scenes in the shanty town where Charles was a child were very effective.

The cast aside from Fox was quite strong, made up mainly of relatively unknown performers.  There were many other things to enjoy about the film.  Of course, the music is absolutely sensational, consisting either of remasters of original Ray Charles's recordings, or new recordings for which Charles provided the vocals.  I also loved the relationship in the film between Charles and Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records.  There is nothing of the stereotypical relationship between artist and executives that invests so many of the stories of musicians in the 1950s and 1960s.  Ertegun is rightfully remembered as one of the truly great figures in the recording industry, someone who was in it more for the music than for the money, and who treated his artists with a degree of respect that was too frequently absent.  The film does a good job of presenting Charles's dilemma:  ABC-Monument made him an offer that he simply couldn't refuse, yet at the same time we are all aware that Charles was, in a way, screwing Atlantic over by leaving them for ABC-Monument.  All in all, I loved this warts and all approach to the subject matter.  There is absolutely no question that Ray Charles was one of the most astonishing performers of the fifties and sixties, and doing all he did despite his blindness is an amazing saga.  He truly was a genius, even if he was a somewhat flawed person.  But you have to love the way that he managed to overcome his personal shortcomings to become not merely one of the most successful but one of the most beloved musical performers of his age.",1098921600,,4978,4.785714285714286

First of all, it hits all the right notes, pun intended, the music is all Ray's and it's great to have so much of it blasting through the speakers of a theater.  That, is only a small reason why this film is as incredible as it is, the main reason I love this film as much as I do is from a performance of a lifetime by Mr. Jaime Foxx, years ago it may have seemed to be a joke that Foxx could pull something like this off, but if he doesn't get noticed by the Academy, something is truly wrong.  The film itself runs at what would normally be a bit too long for some, 2 hours and 33 minutes, but this film flows so smoothly that at no time did I get bored, in fact, by the end I wanted more, a lot more, but when you make a film on someone's life, you gotta end it somewhere, and I feel it covered enough to make it the great film it is.  This is one of the best bio pictures I've seen in a long time, probably since A Beautiful Mind.  Go see Ray, even if you don't consider yourself a fan of Mr. Charles, you may be surprised by the end of the film, and possibly end up buying a few of his cds.  Ray Charles Robinson, I love you, and so does many more, may this movie help you be remembered, you will be missed.",1098835200,,1295,3.8863636363636362

2213184,4,B0007IF19K,"I can't believe the first two reviewers have already panned this biopic based on music legend Ray Charles just because of the trailer. I'm really looking forward to this one. Jamie Foxx seems like the perfect choice to Charles. First, he has the credibility right now. Yes he's a comedian, but his powerful performance in this year's ""Collateral"" opposite Tom Cruise has told me he's also a serious, dramatic actor. Second, he's an accomplished pianist, so learning Charles' music was no problem.

I believed if Charles was alive still, he'll be proud of it and smiling in heaven. I know I will just by watching the film later this month.",1097280000,,638,4.8
2213185,5,B0007IF19K,"""Ray,"" which I just caught in a sneak preview, is a grand film. It's vastly entertaining, incredibly well-acted and visually striking. Beyond that, the film gives a warts-and-all portrayal of its talented and troubled subject, Ray Charles.

Though it deals primarily with Charles's attempts to make it in the music business and his struggles with womanizing and drug addiction, the film's most touching moments come from jarring flashes to his troubled, rural childhood. One scene, in which Charles's strong mother teaches him how to be self-reliant in spite of his blindness, is played without dialogue, yet the power of the scene reduced me to tears.

Also, the film answers some key questions about how Charles coped with blindness and racism during his life.

Jamie Foxx, who was already brilliant this year in ""Collateral,"" gives his greatest performance to date as Charles. He has the mannerisms of the musician down, yet Foxx does more than mimic Charles and play up the man's disability. He's able to give Charles a sympathetic edge necessary throughout the film, even when Charles does some despicable things to his business partners and the women in his life. Foxx carries the movie, pays proper tribute to an American legend while keeping him human and injects the movie with enthusiasm and a sense of humor. This is the sort of acting that should and hopefully will garner an Academy Award nomination.

Charles filled his life with intelligent, strong women. Kerry Washington and Regina King, playing his wife Della and his mistress Margie Hendrix, give notable performances in the film.

Though the film has some flaws, it's compelling and watchable. And the touching story has an added impact because of Charles's recent death.

Thankfully, the movie, done with Charles's approval before his death, is filled with his great music.

I highly recommend ""Ray.""",1096329600,,1871,5.134868421052632
