8249434,5,B00138RBBO,Have had the book for years and had several questions. This DVD answers all of them. The presentation may seem a little corny but if you want to unlock this unknown format this is the only way to go. Great resource material to review in the future.,1522368000,,248,4.297872340425532
8249435,5,B00138RBBO,On time and as described,1517961600,,24,4.0
8249436,4,B00138RBBO,It goes some much detail on how to play the bass which I need to know,1461888000,,69,3.375
8249437,5,B00138RBBO,I have been playing metal bass for 21 years and this is a great video for any aspiring metal bassist. Get the book as well it makes a lot more sense with the book. Don't listen to the posers on here looking to promote there favored books. I have been through most of the bass books in the last 10 years and The Grimoire series is by far the best for the serious musicians out there. Most bad reviews on these books are from want-a-be metal heads that don't want to put in the work to be a great player. If you are for real pick them and work hard and you will see results.,1398124800,,572,3.982608695652174
8249438,3,B00138RBBO,"This DVD is particularly helpful if you already own the book. As you would know, then, Adam must have OCD, because his books are so incredibly complete/complex, that it makes it hard sometimes to see here he is going. Well, in this DVD he tells you. Most of it I already knew, but there were some nuggets.

BTW - the red envelope people have this for rent! And the whole wizard thing is, IMHO REALLY cheezy :-P !",1376352000,,412,4.282051282051282
8249439,1,B00138RBBO,"It's a joke.  There is some information covered but it is not well organized.  It's just some dork who wants to act like he's a heavy metal, devil worshipping, wanna be.
 The ""actor"" could have been a mannequin; he sat still on his ""throne"" with his stupid hood pulled down over his face and just talked.",1237766400,5,304,4.392857142857143
8249440,4,B00138RBBO,"I agree with the reviewer above. There is much time spent on cheesy effects and a silly wizard imparting arcane knowledge. Past all that crap you do get a great body of info. Remember, most music lessons cost anywhere from $20 to 50 for an hour. Here you get a dvd that can be reviewed anytime you need. His Scales and Modes is also a great disc. However, they are not complete educations, but intro to's.",1210550400,7,405,4.342105263157895
8249441,4,B00138RBBO,"This dvd definitely compliments the book and helps tie things together. My only complaint is with the theatrics and vocal effects. This dvd would have been better if given an option to choose type of audio (style of narration). I would have chosen listening to the narration without the vocal effects. Don't care much to see the narrator dressed as the grim reaper (supposed to be a wizard but I see no resemblance to Merlin). Maybe if this dvd were trying to capture the attention of the death metal crowd it might be appealing. For distribution to a broader range of bass players, they should consider a more serious approach for the next version released. Minus one star for the grim reaper and vocal effects. Otherwise this would have been a five star. If you can tolerate the poor vocals and costumed actor, then get this dvd. There's no guarantee they will revise this dvd to make it more mainstream. The instructional information provided by the dvd is top notch.",1206489600,10,970,4.711764705882353
