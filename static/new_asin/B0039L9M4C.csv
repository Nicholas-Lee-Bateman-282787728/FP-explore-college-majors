I have had the wonderful opportunity to take classes with Carly personally and this is the ONLY instructor whose DVDs I would recommend.  I feel as if she is in the room with me personally!  I LOVE THIS and all of her DVDs and would absolutely recommend them to others!",1277596800,,517,4.5978260869565215

I have practiced yoga for a year and have some experience but needed some guidance to keep my personal practice while at home and pregnant. This DVD gave me some great ideas but  i probably would not watch it again....

What i did not like:

1. too much talking and mentioning every pose we will do next and explaining every single variation. It is good for someone who just started - but i can't imagine listening to it one more time instead of moving to the next pose. I think its also one of the reasons why 40 min. session does not have a lot of poses - just talking etc... as well as comments of the instructor - this feels good, that feels good... I am used to class setting where the teacher guides you into different poses and creates a flow, instead of pausing after every side...
2. no music... i mean - at all... just instructor talking and commenting on what feels good to her.
3. the set... or the lack of it. Seems like a home made dvd : legs of instructor cut out some times, and you can see where the ""decoration/background"" cover ends on one side of the screen. Its not important as much - but just adds to overall experience.

So overall - it has some good poses and guides you to what you can do each trimester, but if you are experienced yogi and do not like step-by step instruction of where to move your block when you do same pose on the other side - save your money and do your own sequence to music you love and at your own pace.",1276128000,,1538,4.151006711409396
