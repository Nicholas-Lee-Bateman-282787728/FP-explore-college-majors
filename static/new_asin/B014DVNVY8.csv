Sequences include: Leopards mating at night, the raising of several litters of cubs, contact with other predators as well as many other interesting sights and incidents never previously recorded.

Gathered from seven years of observation, this compelling documentary contains a vast store of information about one of Africa's mot elusive predators, the leopard, a silent, devastatingly successful hunter.

Experts agree that this unique opportunity to observe leopard in the wild may never again present itself.""",1445385600,,716,5.4324324324324325
