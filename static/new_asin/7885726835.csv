Each of his films deal with Japanese domestic issues.  He took the family oriented film to the realm of art film territory.  You are asked to observe characters dealing with relationship issues.  They are confronted in usually five places: the home, work, school, bars/restaurants, & outdoors in contemplation of nature and arranged nature.  Most of his movies can be summed up in a couple of sentences.  That is not to say they are simple or boring.  It does mean they really don't have any plot as Western audiences are use to.  The plots are usually a variation on the following: inter-family differences (marriage is a big one), work related stresses, interference of well-meaning friends, longtime friendships formed from school ties, etc... It's impossible to sum up Ozu's amazing film output in a paragraph of two.  If you're looking for a samurai film maker, you need to look elsewhere.  If you can devote time and concentration on intelligent film making you will be rewarded with a unique experience and one that will stay with you long after you have viewed each film.
I've viewed just about all of Ozu's sound films (he has a highly respected group of silent pictures also) and I've only been disappointed by one film.  I won't say which one because it's a very respected film.  Taste will go a long way to which films appeal to you.  Take the plunge either way.  If it's not for you, you'll know.  But do give each film a good 30 min to get going.  Many times you'll be thinking this film is not about anything.  Again, alot of this is our Western heritage of action/plot and fast pacing.  None of these concern Ozu.  He is concerned only with humanity.",1346803200,,1840,4.672897196261682
