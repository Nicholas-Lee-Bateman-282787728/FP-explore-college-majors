5929315,3,B00ENZAZYE,"All and all this was a pretty good way to spend an hour. However, I'm no shark expert but I kept noticing factual missteps; most notably at 50:52 they were explaining Great White Shark teeth but showed the underside of a Sand Tiger Shark. There were a couple other oddities that I didn't bother to note but were noticeable enough that my gut says weren't accurate.",1393027200,10,364,4.53030303030303

8607198,3,B00ENZAZYE,"Pros: Good message at the end.  Decent 3d effects

Cons:  Talking about great whites while showing a ragged tooth shark, is a big NO NO for kids.  It's scientifically incorrect!
Godawful musical score that makes you want to put a gun in your mouth, or just start crying in depression.",1423008000,7,284,4.62
