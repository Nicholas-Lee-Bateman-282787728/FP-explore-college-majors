2802427,5,B000OY9VCU,my kids never heard of the Littles and the DVD gave them a lot of fun!,1238630400,,70,3.4375
2802428,5,B000OY9VCU,This was perfect for the kids.  This item was new in the box and remided me of when I was a kid.,1237334400,,96,3.3636363636363638
2802429,3,B000OY9VCU,"The stories are right from the book. Not a Christmas story, but stories of the Little Family.",1235433600,,93,4.529411764705882
2802430,4,B000OY9VCU,"Okay so none of the episodes are very Christmassy, but The Littles was a great quality cartoon. You get 4 unedited episodes at a great bargain price. Perfect for a stocking filler - which does make it fairly Christmassy lol. I've just bought mine in time for Christmas and can't wait to be taken back to the 80s! It's also a great taster for those wanting to get the complete series on dvd.",1229472000,,390,4.3561643835616435
2802431,5,B000OY9VCU,Before the television series there was the theatre release to the Littles that started the series off. Based on the beloved children book series about little people with tails living in the walls of people's houses. If you ever wondered how Henrey Bigg became friends with Tom and Lucy this movie explains it all. How they teamed up the save their home from being bull dozed to the ground while Henrey parents are missing half way across the world.,1222214400,,448,4.6835443037974684
2802432,1,B000OY9VCU,"great shows, but the title is completely misleading.

I am SO disappointed.

I can't believe they marketed this in such a deceiving fashion!

THIS IS A LIE!",1197849600,,156,4.703703703703703
2802433,4,B000OY9VCU,"I love the littles and I was so excited when I saw this Christmas edition. There is snow in one episode but nothing has to do with Christmas!! Nothing! I was so disappointed. The episodes were good but please don't expect this to have ANYTHING to do Christmas. Other than that the episodes were good, just like I remembered!!",1123459200,,325,4.52542372881356
2802434,2,B000OY9VCU,"now, before i start let me just say that ""the littles"" has been a favorite cartoon of mine(and one i haven't seen in ages).  when i noticed this dvd for sale i grabbed it quick, but after watching it i was disappointed that there was nothing to do with christmas aside from the cover art.  however, you get four great episodes from the show, i just wish the company would not have promoted it as a christmas special.",1085529600,3,416,4.32051282051282
2802435,3,B000OY9VCU,"After all these years of not being released to home entertainment, The Littles are livin' with you again. Aside from it's TV movie Here Come The Littles from Playhouse Video in the late '80s, and a early '90s release from BMG, as well as a late '90s release from DiC, and the rare Liberty & The Littles which is a rare release. Anyway, the DVD was great. I do not know why it's considered a Christmas special release because non of these have to do with Christmas (even though the one title A Present For Grandpa Little is a bit of a refrence), but the episodes are actually Looking For Grandma Little (1984) (which is titled A Present For Grandpa Little), The Spirits Of The Night (1983), as well as the show's final episode ever The Little Girl Who Could (1985). Plus also, there's a bonus episode on the DVD ""The Little Scouts"" (1983). The opening is intact before the menu and I am happy to report that The Little Ideas For Big People segments (aka A Little Known Fact in 1985 episodes) are intact except on the bonus episode and nothing is sped-up and I am very happy that they kept the DIC logo with Dinky tossing the button is intact as well. So I give this release three stars!",1082332800,7,1185,4.366515837104072
2802466,5,B000OY9VCU,"Me and my brothers watches this show growing up over 20 years ago and we still quote random parts when we see each other.  I purchased this so my son could enjoy it as much as I had as a child, and he absolutely loves it.  Great family show with, fun story line.",1398902400,,262,3.9245283018867925
2802467,4,B000OY9VCU,"Ever since I was a kid, I watched The Littles and had a feeling my children would love them just as much. This movies is great for children 3 and up, I'm hoping to find an awesome deal for the complete series.",1371859200,,209,4.0
2802468,5,B000OY9VCU,this was and is one of my most favorite cartoons.  i had to get this movie to show my niece and nephews what a good cartoon was all about.  these cartoons actually have a lesson learned in them and are not like the shows on tv today.  disney channel is not good and the shows are way too grown up for the audience they try to capture.,1360627200,,334,3.955223880597015
2802469,5,B000OY9VCU,Thanks for the rapid response.  My son got to enjoy over two weeks of anticipatory delight seeing his gifts wrapped under the tree and then the unparalled joy of actually enjoying it on Christmas and every day thereafter.  Thank you!,1356825600,,233,4.8
2802470,5,B000OY9VCU,Watched this all the time when I was a kid and figured it would be great for our children to watch someday.  Just as good as I remembered it!,1356048000,,141,3.8620689655172415
2802471,4,B000OY9VCU,"The Littles was one of my children's favorite shows when they were little. This movie will allow them to share it with their children

Thank you",1353888000,,144,4.538461538461538

2802473,1,B000OY9VCU,"While ""The Littles"" were a fun cartoon when I was a child, and it is nice to have them on DVD, there is NOTHING about this that constitutes a christmas special.
Snow in the background does not count.

Do not purchase this.
buy one of their other collections instead.",1281830400,3,266,4.428571428571429
2802474,5,B000OY9VCU,"""Here Come the Littles"" is actually the first full-length version (it runs around 72 mins) which explains how the Littles, i.e. Tom, Lucy, Cousin Dinky, Grandpa Little, etc come into the life of Henry, the young boy who is forced to live with his evil Uncle Augustus. Augustus has been appointed Henry's guardian (or so he claims) whilst Henry's parents are lost somewhere in Africa. The Littles (who look human but have elf-like ears and mouse-like tails) happen to live in the crevices of the house. This full-length feature is actually the first story about the Littles and explores how Henry and the Littles become friends and how the Littles help Henry put an end to Augustus' machinations.

I recently purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Littles-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000TGJ86M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Littles - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;but buyers need to be aware that ""Here Come the Littles"" is not included on the set. The set comprises the other episodes (which only run about 20 mins per episode). I loved this series as a young child and am glad to be able to share it with my 5-year-old who loves the stories, the interesting plots, and adorable characters. There is much to be said about the older children's programs compared to some of the abominable shows passing off as kids' entertainment these days.",1271894400,,1385,5.47196261682243
2802475,1,B000OY9VCU,"I am not sure why this DVD is titled Christmas special, there is nothing about Christmas on this DVD.  It appears to me that they are episodes snatched from the Saturday morning cartoon.  I would not buy this if you are looking for a Christmas special.  However, if you are one of the ones that watched this when it was on Saturday morning and you thought you wanted the series on DVD, this is a good DVD to buy.  I decided against buying any more because the serious was not quit like I remembered.",1265587200,2,499,4.276595744680851

8187298,3,B000OY9VCU,"The meaning  of Christmas is sharing and caring, which these episodes defiantly do have, but there is no Christmas themed episodes which was a little misleading. They don't even talk about Christmas at all..But the message is there..",1475452800,,233,5.131578947368421

One is about finding a perfect gift (not for Christmas). That's about as close as it gets. Cute episodes, but NOT a Christmas special, as advertised on the cover.
