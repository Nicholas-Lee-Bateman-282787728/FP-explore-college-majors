450087,5,6302309514,"The Doctor was another of those excellent, well-made 1990-91 releases pre-empted by laser-guided bombs and missiles of the 1990 Gulf War and forced into the video occult. But that's not stopped it from a second chance via DVD where it may get well-deserved recognition and revenues for each actor and crew's excellent contributions.
 The cast drove home messages that health care professionals need take a good look at ""because one day you'll be sick to"" ... So ""physician, heal thyself"" and thereby prepare to heal others all the way down to your bedside manners. The Word is eventually sent via Jack McKee and partner whose cavalier professionalism (""Get in, cut it out and couldn't care less!"") is callously unsuited to genuine warmth patients need communicated to them. And then there's the insurance companies who, like them, run on ""stats"" and ""the bottom line"" to coldly determine who lives and dies on the medical production line.
 You don't know what it's like until you hear those 3 words ""You've got cancer""; they'll floor you -especially if you're a physician who knows the realities of catastrophic illness. So ""a taste of my own medicine"" (subtitle to book movie is based on) engages McKee when he's told that. I've walked hospital hallways like McKee on the way to radiation therapy and sat with the terminally ill, knowing I'd likely survive (Or would I?) and that others were terminal, and encountered my own death watch. The disingenuous reassurance McKee gave others is sheer hypocrisy and his facetious talk of golf antagonizes ""the herd,"" whom he'd felt beneath his ivory tower profession and HIS herd of incompetents. But now, his relation with a dying patient, whom he actually befriends, turns him inward and he admits his and the profession's shortcomings - then he falls out of love with himself - all too late to save her but soon enough to save himself and his family from the same callousness engulfing all but a few.
 It sends a strong message to those who profit from medicine at the deadliest expense to others whom it's supposed to save! My only complaint is that Amazon.com hasn't mailed me my DVD of it yet. How long will it take?",1081209600,4,2165,4.845945945945946
450088,5,6302309514,"""The Doctor"" is one of my favorite films. I have seen it maybe 10 times (on VHS) and know much of it by heart. There is nothing artificial about this film. It is a human story about real people, well directed and edited, and with sincere, fleshed-out performances from everyone in the cast.

At the opening we see the successful heart surgeon Dr. Jack McKee, quite full of himself, performing another major operation while ""Let's Get Drunk and Screw"" plays in the background. We see him as he makes his rounds, failing in his attempts to interact on a human level with his patients, substituting crude attempts at humor for genuine compassion. We see him failing at home as well, as his professional life alienates him from his wife and son. All this begins to change when a seemingly minor throat irritation is diagnosed as laryngeal cancer. Then he learns what it is like to be on the other side of the medical profession, and it changes his life.

William Hurt is perfect as Jack McKee, and he is wonderfully supported by Christine Lahti, who plays his wife, and Elizabeth Perkins, who gives an amazing performance as June, a young woman with a grade 4 brain tumor who has a powerful impact on Hurt's character. June and Jack share a scene in the desert at sundown that gives me a lump in the throat every time.

Also worth mentioning are Wendy Crewson, who plays a rather nasty ENT surgeon who gives Jack a dose of his own medicine (so to speak), and Adam Arkin as Dr. Eli Blumfield, ""the Rabbi"", who has often been the butt of Jack's humor around the hospital, because he talks to his patients while they are anesthetized.

The Doctor is a film that illustrates the importance of treating people as human beings and not as objects or numbers on a chart. Highly recommended! (I've pre-ordered the DVD too.)",1071532800,9,1810,4.594427244582043
450089,5,6302309514,"I just love this movie. I saw it when it first came out back in the early 90's and just recently saw it again. I cannot believe I went all this time without watching this beautiful movie! I just recently acquired a VHS copy and have now watched it twice in only the last few days. What I like about the movie, first of all, is the fact that what happened in the movie then--with arrogant doctors, paperwork shuffling, etc.-- still applies today. The plot has never grown old. But what I really appreciate about the movie is the variety of issues it includes. It is to my understanding that this movie is required by atleast some medical schools for their curriculum. I do know however, that there are some doctors who apparently have not seen this movie (I know by experience of course) and need a dose of it themselves.",1067990400,2,820,4.437086092715232

450091,5,6302309514,"and that is what happens to Dr. Jack McKee. He's a rather unfeeling member of the medical profession, who believes strongly in not getting close to a patient. When he is diagnosed with throat cancer, he gets to experience what it is like to be scared after learning; be annoyed while waiting for other docs to get to him; fill out forms he just completed earlier in another part of the hospital & feel vulnerable while in one of those awful gowns (etc.) Jack becomes close to a woman who is also undergoing radiation treatment and she really helps him mend his ways.
This film is important to me. Ten years ago, I was diagnosed with a condition that required my numerous hospital stays...MRI scans...radiation treatments...and enabled me to see that there really are too many callous -- even cruel -- health care workers. They kept on coming, and it's enough to get you to care less and less about yourself and even refuse other treatment.

Knowing that all these folks who were mean to me throughout my treatments will someday be on the opposite end gives me some comfort. Every doctor should see this movie, based on a book written by a doctor (""A Taste Of My Own Medicine"") that I recommend, too. An emotional, well-done movie that I am glad was made.",1019347200,12,1254,4.598214285714286

The film was realistic in its portrayal of healthcare from the  patient's perspective.",955238400,5,388,4.848484848484849
450095,5,6302309514,"Every doctor - and every patient! - should see this movie; the difference is that, not all doctors will understand *why* they should see it..
I use The Doctor when teaching my medical students how to avoid becoming a  certain kind of doctor; the kind who is so detached from humanity that they  never feel anything of the pain, fear - and the hope - that their patients  feel. They have forgotten how to care, and they don't care  to remember  it.
This is a film about a medical `Everyman`; Jack (played by William  Hurt with great integrity and skill)is redeemed as a human being - and as a  doctor - by his own experience of serious illness, and by that of his  friend - her death frees him from the blinkers of self-absorption. The  scene where the two of them dance in the Nevada desert is breathtaking.
Supporting cast are excellent; especially Mandy Patinkin as Jack's  unscrupulous surgical partner. Jack's initially dysfunctional family life  is a central part of this movie, and the roles of his wife and son are well  played.
The last scenes are amongst the best; especially where Jack is  explaining to his interns why they are going to spend the next 24 hours not  as doctors, but as hospital patients - wearing hospital gowns, undergoing  all the appropriate tests, and (horror of horrors) eating hospital food.
The following and final scene is simply beautiful, as Jack stands on the  roof of the hospital and dances by himself, revived and renewed.
Anyone  involved in medical or healthcare education should have this video - and  use it! Others should watch it to understand better what can happen to  medical students along the way to becoming doctors.",923011200,53,1669,4.71280276816609

450171,5,6302309514,"This is a wonderful movie. We were asked to watch this for extra credit and write a paper about some of the themes for my Concepts of Quality in Healthcare class. It did a really nice job illustrating sometimes the emotional disconnect patients experience through the treatment of their physicians. The general idea of the story is one showing emotional growth a physician goes through when diagnosed with an invasive illness and the empathy he develops over the course of the film for how he treats others and especially patients. Not to spoil all of the film, but the adage, ""A dose of your own medicine"" summarizes the main story of the film.

So that is the review of the film, but why do I rate it five stars?

I clearly enjoyed the film but that is not why I rated it so well. I think this deserves five starts since I actually believe anyone going into health care delivery or management should watch this movie. Clearly the film is not some sort of cathartic life changing thing for most people, but I think it is a wonderful teaching tool to establish and demonstrate a proper attitude any healthcare professional should hope to learn and ultimately cultivate for themselves. If you are going into healthcare as a clinician (someone who puts their hands on a patient, recommends therapy or touches the patient chart) or becoming a healthcare administrator, this movie serves both populations equally well since it is all about humanizing the patient, humanizing, whatever measured statistic is given, and humanizing the cost of care. This could simply be a useful starting point to introduce higher quality of care since it illustrates that the highest quality of care begins with how we treat one another which should have no end.

So to me, the five stars are deserving, not because of this being a cliche story, instead to me it deserves the rating since it illustrates that quality health care happens when we think of each others as humans and treat them that way.

I think a lot of these ideas are enforced and expanded upon by the Studder Group, the book Why Hospitals Should Fly, by Nance, and The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Lencioni. There are of course many more books that discuss these ideas and how to implement them, but really, the transformation the lead character goes through in the film is powerful enough to let people witness what High Quality Healthcare is all about.

Lastly, this could also be useful for patients in approaching their physicians if they feel like they have been mistreated by them. The film somewhat summarizes a lot of the day to day stress physicians experience and shows what compassionate care is. The film could also simply help be a starting ground for talking with your doctor about being treated better. And if you are having a horrible experience with a physician, as always, get a second opinion.",1482969600,3,2860,4.746478873239437

If you have been through any hospitalizations or medical tests, you know what the doctor-turned-patient felt. Too often, patients are pretty much just pieces of furniture to the medical professionals. This movie will make you feel better in that it is much needed validation of the crap we sometimes endure as we try to get health care. A negative has nothing to do with the content of the movie but rather Amazon and the streaming service. The sound cut out frequently and the picture froze several times.

This movie was so good it actually inspired me for a preaching at my church. You see, many times we like to live our lives a certain way without caring for the others. We judge but we never can be in their shoes. In this movie you can see one of the main problems we have with our doctors: they forget to feel. This movie will show you that everything in life is like a wheel, sometimes you'll be up and other times you'll be down.

It shows what it is like to be a patient, the helplessness, the feeling of powerlessness, the loss of dignity - all of which are things patients can feel or experience. I wish doctors had to watch this movie before they finish med school because it might just give them something to think about in the way they approach patients. William Hurt was wonderful in his portrayal of the doctor who finds he has cancer of the vocal chords, and suddenly experiences what it is like to be the vulnerable patient instead of the powerful and arrogant physician he was prior to his humbling and frightening experience as a cancer patient.

450537,3,6302309514,"[Major Spoiler Alert!] My Mom passed of cancer and I've worked indirectly with doctors for nearly 20 years (typing their medical dictations), so this movie was high on my list, though it managed to slip through my fingers since 1991, until now.  I couldn't help but notice the surprisingly good reviews for this movie, as if it's being put up on a pedestal, like most people do with doctors in general, but I'm not one of those people; I'm a nonconformist (also, a doctor being a patient isn't really that much of a novelty, the way it's made out to be, so I feel that particular praise is disproportionate to the film's true quality).  William Hurt (1985 Oscar Winner for ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"") plays ""Dr. Jack McKee,"" a surgeon who enjoys uplifting music in the background during his operations, in attempting to convince the viewer that he must be a likable, regular guy.  Christine Lahti (1988 Los Angeles Film Critics' Best Actress for ""Running on Empty"") plays his wife, ""Anne.""  One day, Jack starts to feel a scratchy, sore throat that seems too persistent, so he has it checked out by his colleagues via a biopsy.  It turns out to be a growth that tests positive for malignancy, so, understandably, his life is turned upside down.  He's relieved to hear, though, that the chemotherapy treatments are about 80% effective in eradicating a laryngeal (throat) tumor.  While undergoing the treatments, he meets and gets to know fellow cancer patient ""June"" (Elizabeth Perkins, who surprisingly steals the film and is probably most remembered for ""Big"" with Tom Hanks), who has stage 4 cancer, the worst/highest level with the lowest chances of survival.  However, after undergoing the treatments, his hopes are (temporarily) shot down when he finds out he's in the 20% of patients for whom the treatments don't work and is told the tumor has actually grown in size, requiring surgery.  Having many doctor friends, his surgeon buddy is able to remove all of it, so the movie ends on a positive note.  Sounds like a premise with promise, right?  In my opinion, though, there were too many scenes that weren't heartfelt and didn't seem to have closure (as an aside, I can't help but compare ""The Doctor"" to Lahti's ""Running on Empty,"" which was distinctly superior to ""The Doctor,"" because the producers of ""Running on Empty"" somehow managed to make the heart-wrenching scenes in that film tender and beautiful, something ""The Doctor"" wasn't as successful at doing (please see my separate review for ""Running on Empty"" on Amazon, Feb 2014).  In fact, the only genuine, emotion-inducing scene in ""The Doctor"" for me was when the young man, a fellow cancer patient who, we see, has started to lose his hair due to his own cancer treatments, starts crying after June tells the other cancer patients in the waiting room that an older friend of theirs with cancer has died.  Example #1 of scenes without closure:  When Jack tells his young son (a solid Charlie Korsmo, whose character is approximately 10 years old) that he has a growth in his throat, his son doesn't seem to understand, then just hops on his bike, and the scene ends.  There is no subsequent scene where Dad breaks down the explanation more for his son to truly understand, no father-son embrace, and no comforting line from Dad explaining that everything is going to be okay.  Example #2:  When Jack is surprised to find Anne in the waiting room (because his daily treatments only take 15 minutes), she tries to get him to express his feelings after she finally opens up to him and admits that she has felt, more than anything, lonely.  When Jack seems ready to respond, his beeper goes off, after which Anne simply leaves in a minor huff (because she's surely used to that, being a doctor's wife), and, again, the scene just ends.  In fact, Jack and Anne's relationship is probably the most significant Achilles heel in ""The Doctor,"" though, fortunately, its strengths outweigh its weaknesses.  I did feel like they loved each other, but I didn't feel like they were ""in love"" with each other because, emotionally and romantically, they seemed to remain at arm's length, though the reasons why mostly remain a mystery to the viewer.  Plus, Jack's relationship with June was ambiguous enough for some to believe that he perhaps preferred June over Anne, especially when he started leaning on June for emotional support when one would've thought he would've gone to his wife, something that didn't go unnoticed by Anne.  Jack and June even take a side road trip to the Nevada desert (in fact, on the DVD cover where it looks like a couple dancing, that's Jack and June, not his wife, Anne), because Jack wanted to help June check something off her bucket list, with Jack not even telling Anne until after the fact and Anne having been very worried about his whereabouts, and Jack just explains to Anne, when finally calling her, that he'll be home in the morning, with many open-ended questions there for the viewer.  After June dies and Jack and Anne finally clear the air and appear more like a true married couple, it makes one wonder if Jack was really just settling for Anne.  Example #3:  The night before Jack's operation, Jack knocks on June's door, waking her up from a sound sleep (quite insensitive and maybe even a little selfish on Jack's part, with Anne having stage 4 cancer).  Somewhat indecisively, Jack tells June that he needs her support, that he's very anxious about the surgery, and she seems to hesitantly say that it'd be okay for him to come in.  But then he finally says he's sorry for waking her, decides not to come in, and just leaves, and the scene just ends, an awkward scene, indeed, considering it was the last time that they would see each other, though she does mail an old-fashioned letter to him that he receives posthumously and emotionally reads as the movie ends, again making the viewer wonder about their feelings for one another.  It also didn't help the viewer to care more for Jack when his character, at least at first, seems to expect preferential treatment in being a doctor, namely being priority as a patient (though June justifiably corrects him on this), and the unnecessary subplot of Jack possibly testifying against some of his colleagues in an unrelated malpractice suit yielded yet more questions, not to mention bumping the movie's run time to just over 2 hours (too long).  The exceptional performances of Hurt, Lahti, and Perkins, however, still rise above all the open-ended scenes and questions that the movie produces, though, again, the doctor-patient tables being turned isn't really all that much of a novelty.  Still, if nothing else, ""The Doctor"" is a mostly valuable movie-going experience for the discussions it may create.",1421798400,2,6762,4.82439446366782

I'm not talking about ALL nurses and doctors, because I know some who are very down to earth and friendly, and treat people with respect. But this movie is an excellent example of what CAN happen to health care professionals who think so highly of themselves.  I think it should be mandatory for every medical student, doctor, and nurse to see this movie once a year to remind them what patients go through on a daily basis.  I just hope that any doctor or nurse who sees this movie develops some humility, and humbleness, because frankly, we, as patients are tired of your uppityness (if that's even a word).

Its a shame that human beings can be so jaded and cold until they themselves experience trauma and suffering. It would be a better world if we as humans cared more about one another no matter if our own state of health is excellent or not. None the less The Doctor is a powerful lesson in humanity. Humanity that is inquired through ones own suffering. Stopping to take a long look in the mirror at our own selfishness somehow seems much easier when we have some misery of our own in which to relate to it. In this case the doctor here played by William Hurt changes dramatically because he is subjected to the ugliness of cancer. He learns some life affirming realities through his own suffering and by befriending a young girl with a brain tumor, who teaches him how important it is to live life to its fullest, and to try and understand the suffering of others.

Since this 100 was rarely shown on tv, should I let them go or buy dvd copies.  The Doctor fell into this category.  Especially, since I rarely see it being played on tv, I bought a used copy on Amazon and I am glad I did.

I had forgotten how moving the film is and most important, how strong the actors made these characters.  To be sure, there is some predictability in the story of a self-important, detached doctor who finds himself in the patient role. On my recent re-viewing of this film what struck me is how much more relevant the story is now, with non-caring insurance companies determining the treatments we receive.  Today, uncaring doctors are actually the LEAST of our problems!

Another eye-opener is that this movie apparently was never widely released in a dvd format.  I couldn't believe the cost for a Region 1 dvd of this film!  The most reasonable copy I found was a Region 2, so I snapped it up.

By the way, lots of obscure movies are available on Region 2 and Phillips has a region free dvd player for around $40 - well worth it. Bought it on Amazon too.

450946,5,6302309514,"Every now and then, I will see a film 10 to 20 years old that I have never even heard of, for the first time.  And I will immediately fall in love with it, and have it instantly enter my top 100 (at least) list of favorite movies of all time.  After initially viewing this, and coming away with such a favorable opinion, the way I tell if a movie is really as great as I thought upon first seeing it, is that I'm compelled to watch it again, and again, in a short period of time.  So it was with ""The Doctor,"" which I saw on cable on-demand, and which I can't really recommend enough.  Especially to ANYONE involved in our so-called ""health industries.""  And to all the truly great (or could be) ""doctors"" out there whose main concerns are ""empathy"" and ""ethics,"" as far as how they think of, treat, and relate to their ""patients.""  But essentially, I'd hope almost anyone could get something very deep, important, and meaningful from these proceedings.

Only recently, while I was perusing through various on-demand films and their descriptions, did I find the time to watch this movie.  Within a few days, I had watched it several times, and confirmed my original opinion.  This is a GREAT movie, from beginning to end.  In fact, it should be REQUIRED viewing for anyone involved in the American ""medical professions,"" even and especially nowadays, almost 20 years after this film was first made.  In that way, it is kind of like ""Patch Adams"" in my view.  But unlike that movie, this one, again based upon a true story, takes place in and around hospitals, not at a medical school.  And while there is humor here, even if many times it is dark, I'd have to put this way ahead of the Robin Williams' vehicle, which unlike most critics and viewers, I also loved.

Despite being nearly 20 years old, this film speaks to very timely events and debates ongoing vigorously these modern days.  Not only in the social and political realm of many folk's belief that basic health care should be looked upon as a RIGHT not a PRIVILEGE (my own view), but in how screwed up this seemingly ""best health care system in the world"" was, and still is, so many years later.  And how it fails not only the poor (and uninsured), but can also disappoint even wealthy doctors and surgeons, who any day could, can, and do find themselves suddenly a ""patient.""  Indeed, it is this idea of a rather cold and aloof and unsympathetic, ""doctor"" getting a view from the other side (that of a patient) and how it transforms his perspective into a much more humanistic and understanding point of view, which is this film's ultimate charm and importance.

There is a definite reason above all possible others, why this movie gets a virtually unanimous 5 star rating on Amazon and which I am happy to add my humble 2 cents review to the general consensus.  This flick is just plain wonderful, with unexpected and humorous/poignant moments all along, and is believable throughout.  The script, direction, acting, production values, and music, are all top notch.  It is extremely interesting and compelling from minute one to the end credits, and I think only someone against a total overhaul of the USA's present health care structure, with the patient coming first and foremost (which hasn't existed for far too long), might not ""get"" this.

Unfortunately, for now, it's sad that the very concept of decent, universal and affordable (if not outright free) health care coverage for all, seems to escape most of the right-wing, ""Christian conservative,"" republican ""minority"" in D.C., and on the airwaves (especially radio).  And all the people out there who've apparently fallen prey to their lies and resulting irrational and untenable appeals to fears unfounded.  I suggest this film to this latter group most, even if it may fly way above their heads, and materialistic/capitalist spirit.  Because in my opinion, most if not all of them need to see this more than any anyone else.  Although realistically, I think most of these wingnuts may be beyond redemption in their thinking, and in essence, their very humanity, I hope.  I hope I am wrong about this, but real health reform as I write this, seems an almost impossible dream, due mainly I think to the continually effective ""sales"" disinformation campaign waged for decades by the big pharma's and their lobbies and their ilk, and those goshdarn wonderful FOR-PROFIT ""insurance companies"" and ""hospitals"" out there.  If such thinking is the disease of logic and empathy I believe it to be, I wish this movie, could at least open closed minds, be part of the cure, and would turn the needed popular tide in the, in point of fact, one-sided ""health care debate"" this sadly, still topical film deals with.

Based upon the true story, autobiographical book ""A Taste Of My Own Medicine,"" by Edward Rosenbaum, M.D., William Hurt gives an astonishing portrayal of our main protagonist, ""Jack.""  His transformation from arrogant ""doctor"" to unpretentious and enlightened ""patient,"" though a bit slow in coming, is really convincing.  Christine Lahti as his long-suffering wife, ""Anne,"" is excellent as well.  But the real star here is the never-disappointing Elizabeth Perkins as the cancer patient whose experiences and plight help teach Dr. Jack an invaluable and eternal lesson.  Various people Jack meets along the way, are all finely played and very believable as well.  As is this almost unbelievably true story, and this brilliant film adaptation.

This is must viewing for anyone who has been on either the ""doctor"" (or health care worker) side, and/or as well the ""patient"" side.  The first group will certainly learn something from this if they haven't already learned it in their profession.  The second group, ""patients,"" or in other words, most of us eventually, we, the majority, the great unwashed masses personally familiar with the corrupt and discriminatory way the whole system can really operate (no pun intended), will only find a confirmation of their experiences, as I did my own in addition to those of loved ones and friends over the years and to this day.  For everyone though, actually, I can boil down the way I feel about this moving, political, but at the same time almost ""spiritually"" humanist and completely satisfying viewing experience, in two words.

Wisecracks turn to firmness to deadly seriousess in a New York second, and one has to be ever alert to this obvious defense mechanism of keeping others at arm's length,of keeping total control. When potential death comes calling for him, he's totally unprepared for the ordeals that patients face every day-endless paperwork,waiting, incorrect prescriptions, waiting, systemic breakdowns, mis- diagnoses, lack of privacy,waiting, et al. If the film is any good at all, it's in this area, pointing out how broken the system is. In fighting his cancer, Hurt truculently rejects all advice, thus endangering his patients. Finally, he shows terrible judgment, spending days with a misdiagnosed,terminal cancer patient, thus endangering his already fragile marriage. Many reviewers see this as a very realistic film, and in many ways it is. Just don't have Dr. Hurt operating on me. Please send in the team of Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, and Dr. Howard.",1201737600,6,1307,5.199052132701421

He now must go through the health care meat grinder as merely another patient.  He must deal with his illness, family, colleagues, co-cancer patients, student interns, etc. The possibilities regarding human interaction and interpersonal dynamics in this situation are obviously limitless.

A high end cast and set.  William Hurt carries the day with a wonderful performance as said surgeon.  I was impressed also by supporting actors Mandy Patinkin and the understated great talent of Adam Arkin.  I was a little less impressed by female players Elizabeth Perkins and Christine Lahti who I thought were both a little over the top (or maybe that's just me and women).  The San Francisco backdrop is beautiful, as always.  Well written and directed as well.

I would share an observation that caused me to ponder a bit ---- Perhaps I'm just a simple Midwesterner living here in flyover country --- but in the circles I travel in, life-threatening illness always involves appeal to the attention, mercy and resources of God (the ""Great Physician"" if you will). That aspect was absent in this film.  Except for one ambiguous ""thank God"" utterance, the divine help was not mentioned or alluded to.  One would think that SOMEBODY in the film would have at least a modicum of religious conviction.

450974,5,6302309514,"It is often said ""Until it personally effects you, you will generally be apathetic.""

THE DOCTOR is a magnificent true film of one Doctor who learns that true empathy and caring could only be learned when he himself falls victim to disease and the apathy and lack of empathy that he experiences from the medical community. This is an important film and needs to be taken very seriously. Viewed along with the riveting film WIT that explores the same subject, you will think twice about not only the possible shortfalls that you have experienced at the hands of medical professionals, but more importantly how you treat others who are in dire straits. This film makes us examine our own callous attitudes no matter what profession we are in.

Though this not always the rule, for what it is worth, my sister just completed cancer surgery at the #1 Hospital in this country. The surgery was a complete success, but the lack of care and concern had her in absolute fear, tears and anger. Oh yes, there are non-caring health professional, and there are those who go the extra mile. THE DOCTOR examines the former with great success!

William Hurt IS the perfect choice for this role. The script,acting and pace is perfection!

451017,5,6302309514,"I recently had a chance to see the Doctor again, albeit with different eyes. The basic story line regards a cardiovascular surgeon, technically brillant but bereft of human touch. Indeed, initially, he seems somewhat proud of his aloof stance, almost trying to make it into an advantage. He relates to his patients and residents as I have seen many physicians do. Truthfully, the more awful the diagnosis, the more at arms length many physicians hold the situation. Physicians routinely mention that a patient might die, but it's rarely really true and gets mentioned as a matter of fact. When death is really a possibility, it is much harder to say that you might die. Dr McKee comes face to face with this when he becomes the patient, diagnosed with a malignant laryngeal tumor he faces the rigors of radiation treatment and when this fails surgery. He finds that the standoffish posture he had always adopted no longer worked, and the impersonal surgeon he has no longer can do all the things he needs done, both surgically and emotionally.

I had to come face to face with some of these issues when I had to have heart surgery. Truthfully, the hospitals involved did treat me with some preference, but the fears and risks were the same. I learned first hand about the reticence of surgeons to talk about a real risk of death. My surgeon left a blank consent for me to sign. I dutifully filled out the consent including risks and benefits, like a good resident. I missed the chance to look him in the eye and tell him that I trusted him with my life, all the while realizing that it would have made him uncomfortable.... it always makes me uncomfortable. See, while we all realize that what we do carries significant risks, surgeons in the US are very well trained and do very good work. We all tend to assume that things will go very well; and they so often do that we tend to forget that they might not. We become uncomfortable when we realize that just those things are what patients are focused on, just those chances that things might not go well.

Everybody needs the human touch. Even when they seem not to want it.

See the movie. There are times that it's uncomfortable, but that's how it is sometimes, isn't it?",1113004800,15,2224,4.596977329974811
451018,5,6302309514,"This was a good movie for several reasons.  It was entertaining and it well paced, not to fast to catch all the nuances but not poking along either.  It had redeeming value with several lessons, i.e,. developing better attitudes toward patients, to spend more time with family, be more serious about the preciousness of life.  I was glad to see William Hurt in a much better character than in Tuck Everlasting.  He did an excellent job in transition of character.  I thought it was well balanced in that the movie was not 'doctor or hospital bashing' but showing up the coldness and frivilous attitudes sometimes shown toward patients. I can appreciate this having worked in a medical center for 9 years and having been a patient for major surgery myself but in my case having several sweethearts for nurses (except for one).  Some of us have also had doctor like Leslie Abbot: ""Drop your pants so I can check your prostate!""  June Ellis played by Elizabeth Perkins was the heart of the story.  It was her character that brought about the change in a doctor's heart.  Recommended for everyone but especially for health care workers.  Review was of a DVD.",1111104000,2,1154,4.725
451019,4,6302309514,"This movie was made from a book by a doctor who told his own story about becoming ill and learning about the medical profession and its dehumanizing qualities by becoming a patient.  It caused quite a stir at the time and this movie was quite popular when it came out.  William Hurt plays the successful, brilliant, but cold heart surgeon, Dr. Jack MacKee.  He and his beautiful wife, Anne (played so well by Christine Lahti), live a materially comfortable but emotionally detached existence with their son, Nicky.

Dr. Jack has been ignoring a raspy throat and cough until he coughs up blood.  Soon, he is diagnosed with a tumor on one of his vocal cords.  He becomes the patient of Dr. Leslie Abbott who is even colder than him, she is talented but sees only problems to fix, the person exists to her only as something to bring her the illness to cure.  The doctors in this film are largely all of the same stripe.  They are supreme problem solvers who avoid any involvement with the people they are treating.  The one exception, and an object of ridicule of the other doctors is Dr. Eli Blumfield (portrayed very nicely by Adam Arkin).

As a patient, the unhuman sterility of the hospital and its policies become clear to Dr. Jack as he is treated as a container for the problem the doctors are to fix.  One of the things all patients do is wait, and then wait, and then wait some more.  While he is thus engaged in waiting helplessly for treatment he meets another patient, June Ellis (heroically played by Elizabeth Perkins).  She is dying of a grade IV glioblastoma (a type of brain tumor).  One of her complaints is that they should have found her tumor sooner.  At first, Dr. Jack does the ""team"" thing by refusing to admit that they should have and giving her false hope with a lie about a patient in a similar condition who is now a grandfather.

As an aside, one of my family members died of a grade IV glioblastoma.  It doesn't matter when they diagnose the patient.  The treatments they offer are all about stalling death, not preventing it.  In nearly all cases, the patient will die within a year.  June's lack of functional deficit and lack of a surgical scar on her scalp are all dramatic license to help keep June completely sympathetic (gruesome is not sympathetic).  Her head is shaved, but radiation treatment does not leave the scalp with a neatly shaved look.  The hair falls out unevenly, and the high does of radiation often leaves the skin reddened and raw from being burned.  There is no reason to hold back on the radiation dose, since it was all a Hail Mary kind of treatment.  I hope the treatments have gotten better since 1999 and that someday real hope can be offered those afflicted with this miserable condition.  The one great lesson life offers during this time is how little is needed to find life precious.  We spend so much time putting conditions on our happiness that we cheat ourselves of so much.  This kind of illness takes away the ability to even have good days and eventually even good hours.  Good moments become wonderful and intensely full of life.  Something as simple as a chicken salad sandwich and lemon poppyseed cake with a can of Vernors can provide an exquisitely memorable moment.  The movie captures this to a degree, but not as powerfully as it can happen in real life.

Anyway, June becomes the means to Dr. Jack finding his humanity and becoming a better person and doctor.  It is nice that the screenplay has Dr. Jack finding his way in a very uneven and often frustrating way.  The movie ends with a kind of dramatic gag that rewards the audience for following an often grim story all the way through.

Good movie, good notes for all people - including medical professionals - to take about the importance of treating those with whom we interact on a daily basis as real people rather than as an impersonal piece of business.",1110067200,52,3891,4.57514450867052

As other reviewers have stated, this is an insightful, thought provoking movie designed to get the viewer to think about how we treat other people- making it much more than a story about a surgeon who develops a growth on his vocal cords.

The movie has some great laughs-- which I won't spoil here-- as well as some very tender, very tearful moments.  Watching Hurt move the character through the movie, watching him experience things as the real doctor- Ed Rosenbaum, MD did.  The producers and directors did a superb job of turning an autobiography into a highly watchable Hollywood story.  The scene where Hurt confronts the ENT who was (mis)treating him, asks for his chart and takes his business elsewhere was very, very well done.  More people need to recognize that they always have the option of changing physicians-- because working with a doctor who recognizes you as a human being (and treats ALL of you, not just the symptoms) is just as important as finding a doctor who can treat your ailment.

If you're looking for a movie you can watch with your spouse, your parents, or even your teens, watch this one.  It's become one of my favorites.",1518998400,,1271,4.668161434977579
