7808952,4,6300983625,"NOTE this is a VHS. If you do not have a VCR don't buy this. It won't work on a DVD, CD, iPod, etc. I loved this on days when I could not get to the gym. The workout is short enough to fit in on travel days (but you can't find a VCR in hotels any more) and intense enough to make a difference. I burned mine to DVD to take on the road.",1177977600,,335,3.48
