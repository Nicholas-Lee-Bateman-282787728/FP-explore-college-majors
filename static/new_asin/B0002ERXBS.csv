Mr Show remains to this day as the best skit show in the history of television - up there with Monty Python, SCTV and SNL. It's funnier than all of them as far as I'm concerned.

2082596,5,B0002ERXBS,"Before Season 4 came out, I had never watched Mr. Show. I saw commercials for it and everything, but wasn't interested.  So, on one of those ""lonely"" nights, I started watching it. I must say I was very impressed! I was on the floor rolling it was so funny.  The ""Taint"" sketch blew my mind! The ""Civil War re-enactment"" was just like you would see on the History channel. I recorded the rest of the episodes, only to find out it was the last season produced.  I bought the first 3 seasons when they came out on DVD, but nothing touches Season 4 in my mind. All of the sketches had me in stitches. The way the sketches flow into each other, and feed off one another, unbelievable! I know that there are those people out there that don't ""get it"" (like one of my ex-girlfriends)and think that everything should be P.C. Whatever. They probably think ""Sex and the City"" is funny, which isn't to me, but then again I have a sick mind, so scratch that.
I'm just pleased as punch that Season 4 is finally coming out on DVD.

2082782,5,B0002ERXBS,"Mr. Show is absolutely one of the funniest tv shows of all time.  The good thing is that it has aged well. It's still hilarious and maybe only the clothes place it in a specific era.  There is some talk about ""slackers"" in a sketch or two, but it still isn't so tied in with the pop culture of the time that it's now dated.  A few of the sketches fall a little flat here and there, but the overall quality of the writing and performances is very high.

Highly recommended, and all of the seasons are worthwhile and contain classic sketches.",1374019200,,540,4.264705882352941
2082783,5,B0002ERXBS,It's so absurd you might not get the joke at first  - so you should watch at least twice. I saw this skit a long time ago but I never forgot it and often laughed to myself whenever I thought of it  - but it was impossible to explain to anyone nearby why I was laughing to myself like an insane person because this skit is not possible to explain! To find it again purely by chance on Amazon instant video was awesome. I made my boyfriend watch it and he was confused at first even though we share a similar sense of humor. Sure enough after 2 months had gone by he said remember that video you made me watch about Everest and we both laughed just thinking about it. Good times.,1350777600,3,677,4.082706766917293
2082784,3,B0002ERXBS,"If you want to see Mr. Show at its best, I highly recommend seasons 2 and 3.  Season 1 is definitely recommended as well because you can see Mr. Show grow and create it's own world of comedy.  Make no mistake, Mr. Show at its best must be mentioned in the same breath with any other great comedy show that comes to mind...in the history of comedy.

However, by season 4 it became lifeless and seemed to appear everyone was just going through the motions, and it starts with a downer of a 1st episode of the season.  It surprised me during the commentary hearing that Bob thought this was the best season.  Dull, boring, and unfunny are adjectives that I feel best describe what is wrong with season 4.  Maybe I just don't get it, I suppose, because I don't think that David Cross and Bob Odenkirk ""lost"" their sense of humor.  Both have gone on and done other great things, but by season 4 Mr. Show felt like the inspiration was gone.  What made things like ""The Devastator"" ""Swear to God"", the megaphone crooners, Grass Valley Greg with his retarded goats, and Droopy ordering donuts so funny was no longer there.

I did give season 4 a 3 star rating because even Mr. Show not at its best is still worth watching.  For comparison, SNL has become so bad (even with a pretty impressive cast) it's score wouldn't even register.  I don't dare say how many times I've rewatched the entire series of Mr. Show with and without commentary, but every time I get to season 4 it's a major letdown.  And it's hard to cite an exception to this rule as far as particular sketches go.  The dueling supermarket commercials was funny.  Maybe the civil war re-enactment sketch is close to earlier Mr. Show inspiration.  Jay in the Story of Everest is pretty decent, too.  However, that's about all that comes to mind when I think about Season 4.

But then again a majority of people seem to disagree with me about season 4, so make up your own mind.",1297296000,,1932,4.427762039660057

2082818,2,B0002ERXBS,"Seasons One, Two, Three:  ""Go Man, Go!""

Season Four: the one to forego.

Speaking as a fan who was first stupefied (amazed; astonished) by Bob and David back when they were the Kings of Megaphone Crooning (""People didn't want to hear songs about things that hadn't even been invented yet! They wanted to hear songs about NEW things.""), that is, speaking as the rare fanatic, the rare ""Mister Mr. Show"" raising his voice on Amazon who laughs just as hard at the good G rated sketches as he does at the good NC-17 rated sketches, I find ""Season Four"" the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless MS sketches available in one package.

Funnyguy Bob Odenkirk, reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life,  says that Four was the season when ""well-crafted"" sketches were ""in"", ""absurdity for absurdity's sake"" was ""out"".  No longer, he claims, was Mr. Show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers.

Translation:  they dumbed it down for the audience (and/or: horsing around in the writers' room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat, facing the corner).  Enticing as the term is, ""well-crafted"" here seems to mean ""warmed over SNL type stuff"", as in: spicing up the world's 1000th Jerry Springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat (momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is ""funny"" incongruity) and ladling on the same gay panic, the same class anxiety that makes the real Springer show such a howl.  Overall, MS4's concepts  become less novel, less thinky, less left-field-funny, with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true. What I mean is: a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid-guy raunch humor. But at least SGRH is a species of comedy.  I haven't nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies, and accounts for at least 75% of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts. Excelsior?  (ex-cel-si-or  (n.)  Slender, curved wood shavings used especially for packing (originally a trademark)).

This set did make me grin a few times -- over the course of five and a half hours.  One, and only one, sketch makes me laugh out loud: the phenomenon of ""Monster Parties"" (as documented in novelty songs such as ""Halloween Shindig"", ""Dracula's Pajama Party"" and the like) examined with pitch-perfect tabloid TV grammar.  Original, bent premise anchored by yet another  simultaneously vicious and sympathetic David Cross performance.

For the most part, the gang seems tired, like they're having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not-funny.  Surely, anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass.",1107993600,13,2660,4.906040268456376
2082819,5,B0002ERXBS,"THIS IS THE ONE!

The other DVD collections for seasons 1, 2 & 3 were pretty funny (OK...some of the funniest stuff of all time, especially ""Druggachusetts,"" and ""The Chip on the Shoulder Club"") but THE FOURTH SEASON WAS WHEN IT ALL CAME TOGETHER. It doesn't get any better than the episode called ""Show Me Your Weenis!""  The first time I saw this, in 1998 when it first aired, I realized that this was the absolute pinnacle of intelligent, over-the-top American comedy.  Surreal, sharp, better than any British zaniness, and full of bizarre ideas like ""furniture for the blind"" that lets you know where you are with pre-recorded celebrity voices; and the all-time greatest, ""Wyckyd Scepter,"" which must be seen to be believed.

Bob and Dave, you are SO naked!

2082820,4,B0002ERXBS,"I had never seen Mr. Show on HBO before I got the DVDs as they came out. Like previous seasons, this one has a mix of good and bad stuff, with a lot more good than bad. There are tight, smart pieces like the prenatal beauty pageant and the life-raft talk show, but then there are dragging, corny sketches like the ""Date with the Queen"". It's evident from the commentary that even Bob, David, and the rest of the cast feel that there are some real clunkers that just didn't work. On the other hand, Bob is is often critical of sketches that work just fine, so maybe he's just on crack.

There's a nice expansion of the cast in this season. Tom Kenny doesn't show up much, but B.J. Porter and Scott Aukerman have some hilarious roles. Jay Johnston is also more prominent, and he's always funny.

If you liked the previous three seasons, this is definitely worth picking up. The writing, performing, and production values are the best of all Mr. Show seasons.",1099267200,5,956,4.457142857142857

Bob Odenkirk is doing Miller Lite commercials and I hope he does something like David has with his new appearance in Arrested Development.  I can honestly say that this show is not better, yet it is close, to Monty Pythons Flying Circus.  Both are great shows.

2082840,5,B0002ERXBS,"You know, a series like ""Mr. Show"" could ONLY have been founded on cable, and HBO, to boot.  Season 4 demonstrates a couple things lacking from the previous 3: higher production value, a larger writing staff, wicked smooth transitions between sketches, and punchlines that actually escalate beyond themselves, never just stopping when it was already funny.  This season, the funny jokes became funnier -- and wilder.  I hate to admit it, but the ""Marilyn Monster"" sketch (where he's actually narrating a video guide to new employees that work his chain of pizza parlors) was one that I hated first-time, but then I listened to Marilyn Manson lyrics, then watched the sketch again, and keeled over with laughing pains in my side.  This is Bob and David's lesson to the faithful (AND non-faithful) viewer: they're ahead of you.  Not just by a couple steps, but by long jumps.

The aforementioned sketch turned into one of my personal faves from Season 4.  Please, if a punishment for serving out pizza the incorrect way at a Marilyn Manson-esque pizza joint is to make the employee where bloody diapers that bleed out the crotch... it sounds nowhere near funny in print, but if you watch it for that expression on Bob's face it is PRICELESS, I promise you.  Needless to say, if you don't like the subtle and subversive (and anything even remotely P.C.) steer clear of this box set, and the show in general.

Probably the best David Cross skit is his gravetender being hypnotized into recounting the horrid actions he witnessed one night in a cemetary, concerning our favorite movie monsters.  ""The... the mummy's getting drunk and... he wants to f---... and Frankie got mad!""

Sigh, you just gotta be there, folks... you just have to be there.  And once you arrive, you probably won't leave willingly.",1092787200,7,1799,4.862295081967213
2082841,5,B0002ERXBS,"The stated objective of Bob Odenkirk and David Cross in making ""Mr. Show"" was to give America its own Monty Python's Flying Circus. They failed in this, because THEIR SHOW WAS BETTER THAN MONTY PYTHON. They were on cable, so they had similarly crummy resources, but they also had the luxury of time (they didn't have to grind out an episode every six days like the Pythons did).

 Season Four of ""Mr. Show"" is the year it all came together, but seasons one two and three had their moments too. You could do a lot worse than buying up all three ""Mr. Show"" DVD sets, especially if you're a fan of absurdist comedy, done with wit, intelligence, and a healthy crudity too. There is no better sketch comedy show ever, it's as simple as that.",1091059200,45,736,4.444444444444445
2082842,5,B0002ERXBS,"Good lord, there are some great things in life, but I don't know if anything else is this great.  I've only seen about six or seven of the fourth season episodes, but based on what I've seen, I'd have to agree with others here that this season stands atop Mr. Show mountain as the finest they produced.  I feel like I've been waiting an eternity for this set to arrive, so another month and a half isn't going kill me, I suppose.

Mr. Show is phenomenal comedy, but it's really so much more - a way of life, a way of looking at the world, perhaps.  I've never been witness to smarter comedy, where the material often actually gets funnier after repeated viewing.

Mr. Show is the true way!",1090886400,11,689,4.310077519379845
2082843,5,B0002ERXBS,"I have the first 3 seasons on DVD. Mediocre at best. Season 4 is, simply put, some of the funniest comedy ever written. Odenkirk and Cross are at their best here. Crude, unapologetic, it's all here. If you have purchased the first three seasons and were disappointed and vowed never to buy the 4th season. DO NOT. You have my personal guarantee this will rock. (***This is not a guarantee.) Fairsley Foods, Edward Premington, Harrison Greely growing up rich, Wyked Sceptre. Ya, you know what I'm talkin' about!",1089763200,5,510,4.806818181818182
2082844,5,B0002ERXBS,"The Mr. Show did something others seldom do, they got out leaving us wanting more! This is the season to beat, with Sweetie Pie Jenkins, Wykyd [sic] Sceptre, warring summer camps and best of all a ""mouth full of sores!' The song we can't stop singing. This is the chance to complete a collection of absolutley beautiful american sketch comedy, and that don't happen often!",1089676800,4,372,4.7384615384615385
2082845,5,B0002ERXBS,"...The Story of Everest.  That episode alone is worth the price of the DVD. The rest is just icing on the cake-- sweet, hilarious icing.",1089417600,4,136,4.44
2082846,5,B0002ERXBS,"I've probably watched every episode of Mr. Show at least 5 times, and I gotta say, Season 4 was by far the best.  The sketches got more outlandish and funnier as the seasons went on, and some of the stuff in the fourth season had shocked me as much as it made me laugh.  I also think the transitions between scenes got much more clever and crisper as the seasons progressed, and by season 4 they were incredible.  The episode with the ""Description of the lion's roar"" is particularly great.  I've been itching for this to come out since I first heard about Mr. Show being released on DVD.
Clearly explaining why this season was funnier than the rest is about as difficult as describing the comedy of Mr. Show to the uninitiated, so I'm going to resist trying.  I'll post a more detailed review once it's out, but I'm gonna be eagerly awaiting my copy.
A note of caution, though: the humor in this season is decidedly darker than in seasons 1 through 3, and certain sketches may be a little disturbing to some viewers.",1089244800,25,1017,4.446236559139785
8027361,4,B0002ERXBS,"Another good season for the show, and unfortunately the last one. Definitely worth watching if you watched the other seasons. Could also stand on its own if you didn't watch the other seasons for some reason. They're all free on Amazon Prime.",1486598400,,242,4.785714285714286
