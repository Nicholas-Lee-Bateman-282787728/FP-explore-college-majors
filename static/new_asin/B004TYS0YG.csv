8441110,3,B004TYS0YG,"This is a film about an imaginary country, an imaginary kingdom with very imaginary people in it. But this is no fairy tale.
On their wedding anniversary, the Emperor threatens the  Empress to take another wife if  she doesn't give him a heir within the next 6 years.
 The Emperors loyal Chamberlain,( Jonathan Rhys Meyers)  is in charge of finding a young virgin to substitute the Empress if she fails. The girl is to be kept in a secluded place for as many as 6 years : If the Empress succeeds, the virgin will be killed.
The story is interesting but the director seems to care mostly about the aesthetic of the film : very warm  colors in most of the scenes, rich decorations,  heavy make ups, (Jonathan Rhys Meyers hair is a striking blond color, probably as a constrast to the virgins redish hair!). As a result, all actors seem to be left very much on their own, trying their best to make the story credible.",1416614400,,914,4.4431137724550895
8441111,5,B004TYS0YG,"I watched this movie last night, and even though I'm in the US and the film is for Region 2 (I need Region 1), I was able to play it.  I was told it was the Italian version, so I expected to hear the English dialogue with Italian subtitles.  Boy, was I wrong.  The dialogue was dubbed in Italian, and I couldn't make out a word they were saying.  Visually it was very nice.  Even though I don't like Jonny as a blond, he still looked handsome.  He was a good guy for a change.  I'm going to see if there is something I can do to have it play in English.  I do recommend it though if you can watch it in your own language.",1400803200,2,621,3.873015873015873
