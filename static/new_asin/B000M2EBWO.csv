8165835,3,B000M2EBWO,"I can't say I loved this.  I can't even say I liked this.  In fact, I bought several of these classical composer bio things and they're all terribly dry and not very interesting.  I wanted to like it - Sibelius being a musical soul mate and all, but alas I did not.",1501977600,,265,4.0576923076923075
8165836,4,B000M2EBWO,"I like anything to do with Sibelius so I automatically was going to like this effort.  My main disappointment is the film's failure to do more with his wonderful music.  The Sixth Symphony, his least characteristic and perhaps most enigmatic work, is one of the unquestioned symphonic masterpieces of all time but is not heard in the narrative.  I think it holds a key to understanding and appreciating Sibelius and its omission is a lost opportunity.

It is also a shame that Nupen did not interview several conductors for their insights of one of the twentieth century's three greatest symphonists (Mahler, Sibelius, Shostakovich).  Although we see Ashkenazi conducting it would have been better to hear Paavo Berglund, Colin Davis, Simon Rattle, or Neemi Jaarvi (all estimable Sibelians) speak about the composer and his works from the performer's perspective.",1372809600,,863,5.22463768115942
8165837,5,B000M2EBWO,This exceeded my high expectations.  I could watch it over and over.  This mixes a nice documentary and pictures with the music and direction by Ashkenazi.  I like this dvd a lot.,1370995200,,179,4.53125
8165838,5,B000M2EBWO,"See Scott Morrison's review above. He said everything I would have said, and (as usual) more elegantly. This is a splendid film, very atmospheric, spiritual, and (yes) educational too. The program has a very artful and effective fusion of Sibelius' music, naaration based on his diary entries, film clips and photos of Sibelius, family and friends, and lovely Finnish landscapes. I didn't know what to expect, but whetever expectations I had this surpassed them.

I also found interesting Nupen's introduction, and his comments on how he changed his documentary focus from performers to composers, and what that meant for the style of the film. I will definitely seek out his other films.",1355788800,2,688,5.142857142857143
8165839,5,B000M2EBWO,I can't add much more than the other happy reviewers here.  I am adding my endorsement to this lovely film and will seek out other Christopher Nupen films.,1347148800,,155,4.535714285714286
8165840,5,B000M2EBWO,"Christopher Nupen is one of the most creative and talented of the video documentarians of the classical music world. It all began many years ago when he made the wonderful film about du Pr, Barenboim, Perlman, Zukerman and Mehta -- the so-called 'Israeli Mafia.' That film has never gone out of style and was brought out on DVD a few years ago, made available for a new generation of viewers. This film, also originally on VHS, was made in the 1980s and is just now coming out on DVD. The transfer, I must say, is simply magnificent; I certainly would not have known it was originally on VHS if I hadn't seen it in its original form. The visuals are crisp, the sound excellent.

The subject is the life and, more important, the music of Jean Sibelius and the two sections are 'The Early Years' and 'Maturity and Silence.' Nupen, who wrote, directed and narrates the film, takes us through the important biographical details of the composer's life, including his struggle in his thirties with alcoholism on which he conquered only after he had a growth removed from his throat and was told that drinking and smoking would aggravate it and possibly hasten its return, and of the thirty year silence during which he strove to complete an Eighth Symphony but which he finally consigned to flames.

The visuals comprise many gorgeous views of the fields, forests and lakes of Sibelius's Finland, as well as a fascinating black-and-white silent film of the elderly Sibelius. There are also many views of photographs and paintings of the composer and his wife, as well as visits to Ainola, the country home where he and wife Aino lived for over fifty years.

There are some marvelously played and photographed excerpts from all but one of his symphonies -- the Sixth, for whatever reason, is mentioned but none of its music played -- all done by the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra with Vladimir Ashkenazy, a real Sibelian, conducting. There is also excerpts from Finlandia, Kullervo, the Karelia Suite and Tapiola by the same artists as well as a sizable excerpt from the Violin Concerto with Boris Belkin, violin. There are a couple of songs (in Swedish, as most of Sibelius's songs were) sung by Elisabeth Sderstrm. The first, with orchestral accompaniment, is 'Since then I have questioned no further', and the second, with Ashkenazy playing the piano accompaniment, the intensely dramatic 'Jubal.'

There is a clip of Sibelius's first composition, 'Water Drops', for two violins, written at age 11. The film begins and ends with an excerpt from a recording, made in 1939, of Sibelius conducting his 'Andante festivo.'

This is a brilliant and riveting account, aided by Nupen's beautifully written narration, of the artistic life of one of the twentieth century's great composers and one hopes that it will again be seen widely, as it was originally when shown on television.

Although Amazon doesn't indicate it, this DVD is in a format that can be played worldwide. Sound is LPCM Stereo, narration is in English, subtitles are in German, Spanish, French and Italian. Total time (which includes a couple of clips about other Nupen films) is 151 minutes; the Sibelius films run just over 100 mins.

Strongly recommended.

8165841,5,B000M2EBWO,"Transfer of this excellent two-part documentary to DVD is long overdue.  I rented it many years ago on VHS from a library.  The life of the twentieth century composer is explored through narrative, old photos, musical exerpts and ravishing scenic segments showing his native Finland.  More than a standard documentary, this film really brings to life the man with all his frailties and great achievements.  The movie opens with a performance of the Andante Festivo conducted by the composer late in life - that performance sets the tone for the entire film - inspired, troubled, nostalgic and deeply felt.  The musical performances by the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazy are superb.  All in all, a moving and revealing experience.  For those interested in such movie-making, try also ""Roots"" on the Hungarian composer Bela Bartok.  Both are highly recommended.",1168646400,42,856,5.197080291970803
