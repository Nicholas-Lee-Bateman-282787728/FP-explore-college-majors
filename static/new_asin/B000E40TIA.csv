After 4 years of owning the Z1U I thought I knew everything about this camera but to my surprise there were some tricks and procedures I was NOT aware of. It covers every possible aspects of the of the Z1U and the FX1 that are not cover by their manuals and are not referred to anywhere in the internet. The author is very calm and collected in his explanations and allows you to do everything while you watch and listen. A must for any pro or semi-pro. I just hope the author will make similar DVDs for other cameras.",1519084800,,600,4.226086956521739
8130598,5,B000E40TIA,"At first I thought that perhaps this DVD was not that great, but then when I started using it as a reference calling up the chapters I needed greater knowledge on, it has proven its worth beyond a doubt. The best part is being able to see the visuals and stop the movie playback while I locate the spot on the camera and follow along. There are so many controls, switches and adjustments on my Sony ZiU but this DVD covers them all.",1314576000,,432,4.216867469879518
8130599,5,B000E40TIA,"I found this DVD to be extremely comprehensive in helping me learn about the HVR-Z1U and HDR-FX1. I wouldn't have learned as much about my Z1U if I hadn't bought this DVD. I have found no other training DVD that is this helpful.  If your going to spend the money on the camera, the money for this DVD is well worth it.  I learned a lot more about my camera then I ever would have.

These guys know how to make a training DVD.

I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning all they can about these cameras.

The more you know, the more you can do.",1164672000,,564,4.137614678899083
8130600,5,B000E40TIA,"I was able to watch this video and learn the operation of the Z1U camera within mere hours, rather then spending days and weeks searching through manuals and messing around with settings.  This allowed me to become proficient with the camcorder sooner and begin working on projects almost immediately.

The video was easy to understand and very well produced.  Everything is step by step and shows you exactly what is going on. It contained alot of information on features that I may not used without watching this video.

I would recommend this video for anyone who wants to become an expert on the Z1U camera without spending days and weeks inside manuals and books.  Was definately worth every penny.",1164672000,2,703,4.873949579831932
8130601,1,B000E40TIA,My opinion that this DVD is no more than $15.00 and here they selling it at $85.00 WHAT A RIP OFF...,1161820800,,100,3.8095238095238093
