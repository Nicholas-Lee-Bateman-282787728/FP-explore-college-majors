8367610,3,B002EDRUKE,"It's a good DVD, interesting but a bit sterile for my taste.  I think they could have made it more interesting and gotten my heart pounding a bit more at the overwhelming evidence of the Biblical account of Jericho.  For example, it is mentioned in the DVD that there's evidence the walls did fall outward in accordance to the Biblical account but they could have made that more awe inspiring by describing the way the walls were built and the near impossibility that they would have fallen outward...  I think they lost many opportunities in that respect.  I've only watched the DVD once and usually get more out of these things after the second or third viewing, so I will be watching it again and will edit this review if necessary.  All in all, a decent and factual description of Jericho.  For the price, it's worth watching it.",1440115200,,833,4.594594594594595

8367612,5,B002EDRUKE,"I was looking for a video to use in Sunday School, since I was filling in for the real teacher.  We are studying the Book of Joshua.  Jericho Unearthed was very well received by the adult class and also a class of 10-12 year olds.  I particularly liked the description of the way the walls were constructed and then fell down.  The architectural evidence was fascinating and our young people were mesmerized.  Thank you for a great video at a level everyone understood and enjoyed.",1311206400,4,481,4.6117647058823525
8367613,5,B002EDRUKE,"Entertainingly educational and intellectually fair and honest with some of the highest production values I have ever seen, Jericho Unearthed is a brilliant archeological defense of the Biblical story of the Battle of Jericho.

I am already looking forward to other DVD's within the series.",1273622400,2,289,5.4222222222222225
8367614,5,B002EDRUKE,"This was an excellent film, well produced with scholars on both sides and definitely not boring. If you are looking for a film to bolster your apologetic, this will do it. If you are skeptical of the event as a whole and want to gather more information, it will help you as well.

In the film, both sides agree on the location of Jericho, that the walls of Jericho fell outwardly and the city was burned to the ground. All three of these points are in line with the Biblical account. The difference in the archeologist perspectives remain in the dating of the event. One side argued for 1550 BC, the other 1400 BC.

The arguments came down to the dating of pottery. If the earlier date was true, the wall would not have existed when the Israelites approached Jericho, this of course is not the Biblical account. The arguments for the later dating (Biblical account) were significantly stronger. The later dating for the pottery was demonstrated by contrasting duplicate pottery from the same time frame. This places the walls of Jericho collapsing during the time recorded in scripture.

I certainly recommend this film.",1259539200,4,1120,4.762886597938144
8367615,5,B002EDRUKE,"It's not a book, as a previous reviewer called it, but a 34-minute DVD that is well worth a look, especially if you are a student of the Bible. Many have uncritically accepted Kathryn Kenyon's findings of Jericho and have said that the battle of Jericho could have never taken place. Her flawed dating methods and analysis are exposed here in a well-researched video. The producer interviews several archeaologists--including one who excavated with Kenyon half a century ago--to give a plausible case that the Bible account is accurate and trustworthy. The previous work of Garstung--forgotten by many--is also used to show that critics ought to be more careful before pointing to Jericho as a source for the lack of trustworthiness of the Bible. I highly recommend this fast-paced (not boring) production, and I look forward to more work from Expedition Bible.",1251244800,5,861,5.113475177304965
8367616,4,B002EDRUKE,The book contains some good info about the archeological findings at Jericho; especially the fallen walls and their time period.,1249689600,,128,5.45
8367617,5,B002EDRUKE,This product is well done from its research to its production. It exposes the faulty conclusions reached by notable archaeologists when the conclusions are not based on all available facts but rather on faulty presuppositions. The facts presented in Jericho Unearthed concur with the biblical narrative and is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD biblical subject library. I highly recomend it!,1248912000,3,395,5.491803278688525
