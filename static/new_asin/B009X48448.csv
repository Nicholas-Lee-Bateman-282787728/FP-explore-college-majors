5370683,3,B009X48448,"Hold Your Breath is a silly horror film that wouldn't be worth a watch if it wasn't for the gore. There is especially one gore gag that had me cheering. I won't reveal all the details but it involves a truck, a girl, and a tree. The negatives are plot holes and unoriginality. Hold Your Breath basically has the same plot as 80's horror films Shocker and The Horror Show, only it's not as much fun.",1393459200,,398,4.25

5370685,1,B009X48448,"This movie isn't worth your time. The acting is horrible, the effects are laughable, and the writing made me cringe. Even for a B horror movie, this was off-the-charts bad. This gets a F.",1367366400,,187,4.529411764705882
5370686,3,B009X48448,"The movie is pretty typical in the aspect of it being about a bunch of 20-something year old's, taking a road trip or wherever they're going, and stopping at an abandoned asylum, but it's a little different than most. The rebellious stoner character doesn't hold his breath passing the cemetery and now they're all in trouble.

I actually think the idea of this movie was original and unique.. maybe that's just because I grew up believing the superstition of holding your breath as you pass a graveyard. Either way, It hasn't been done before, not that I've seen or heard of anyways.

Some decent kills are featured, along with tolerable acting and a somewhat enjoyable plot. My only real gripe is the ending of the film, I was totally not into it. I guess some people would think it was neat, but just not in my taste.

Definitely worth a watch, very cool concept; not an absolutely amazing film, but it's quite enjoyable.",1365552000,,924,4.656441717791411
5370687,1,B009X48448,"Ouch.  Craptastic acting, lousy writing, stupid scenarios, destitute effects and a ripped off premise make this movie an affront to B-horror.  This is more like D-horror and I give it an ""F."".

In 1956, during an insane criminal's execution at an asylum, he gets violent and babbles a bunch of religious banter until they give him the chair.  But wait second.  Since when do we execute the criminally insane?  And since when have executions been performed at asylums?  [That's Strike 1]

Skip to present day.  Jerry ( Katrina Bowden; Piranha 3DD, Tucker and Dale vs Evil), Kyle, Heath, Tony, Samantha, Johnny (Randy Wayne; Terror Toons 2, Caretaker) and Natasha (Erin Marie Hogan; The Theater Bizarre) load up an SUV and go off on a trip.  They all put their cell phones in the locked glove compartment of the car in what I find to be a very convenient horror ploy to keep them from calling for help later.  This would simply not happen.  No group of seven, social, good-looking 20-somethings would ever do this voluntarily.  No way!  [That's Strike 2]

At the beginning of the drive they pass a graveyard ear the asylum and Jerry goes into a serious panic, blurting out some folklore that if you don't hold your breath then an evil spirit may enter your body.  Really?  A hot, mainstream 22-year old is going to find this worrisome?  [That's Strike 3, and we're only 10 minutes into the movie]  Anyway... Naturally, the stoner (Kyle) wanted to enjoy a good toke and inhaled.  Annnnnnnnd now he's the killer.

They pull off near an old asylum and decide it would be cool to go inside. Weird stuff happens.  Then they go on to their camping trip and we learn that the evil spirit can pass from one possessed person to another by breath.  This sounds like the touch-and-go Rolling Stones-loving Azazel of Fallen (1998).  And, like Azazel, our spirit has a tell.

Outside of some decent blood work, effects including storms, wind, electricity, explosions and fire are destitute. One of the only things about this movie that was done well was a gratuitous sex scene, which really felt like watching a soft-core porn on late night Cinemax and otherwise totally broke the flow and mood of this already insufferably bad horror.  There's other nudity as well and, even as far as direct-to-DVD horror goes, it's not in good taste.  [How many strikes am I up to here?]

In the end, the way they defeat the evil, 20-something-possessing spirit is incredibly stupid--almost enraging.  Okay, I smiled a few times.  But it really is quite terrible.

Let's just skip this one, okay?",1364688000,5,2567,4.752834467120182

5370690,3,B009X48448,"The idea of a killer spirit is not new to the films. These are normally ""Bloody Mary"" movies. Only one time has it been done A+ and that was ""Fallen."" In this Asylum production, we see a mass murderer who was also a preacher being executed.

We then jump to the hard body present where 20 somethings go camping. Along the way they pass a neat looking Spanish Moss cemetery near an abandoned prison asylum. Of course the stoner doesn't hold his breath and we now have the spirit of the slasher loose, entering bodies at will, killing whoever he wants. This could make for a decent film, but for some reason the execution and dialouge didn't make it. They did have a few decent kill scenes, but not enough to make a memorable film. If you're going to do something that has been done, bring back the slide trombone with the knife attachment.

According to the main titles, the film's name is actually ""#Hold Your Breath."" No accounting for that one. It's hardly likely that the Governor of a prison would deliberately detail the crimes of the soon-to-be executed killer with some of his victims present at the execution. Oh well, never mind...on with the show.
Idiot kids out on road trip to some camping site in a black SUV with the manufacturer's logo and vehicle name partially blacked out. Maybe so we wouldn't know it's a Chevy Suburban, who knows? Idiot kids get taken over by ghost of killer as they pass cemetery. They're supposed to hold their breath...Oh God, I can't go on.
This stinker has nothing to commend it whatsoever. Particulary noteworthy are the lame script, direction, acting and the production values...? The real highlights of the film are the midnight chase through the cemetery in broad daylight and what's left of the idiot kids taking off in a Toyota only to re-appear in the hitherto unidentified Chevy Suburban...only to re-appear in the Toyota.

5370692,3,B009X48448,"HOLD YOUR BREATH starts off promising with an intense execution of a serial killer but evolves into the standard young people doing stupid things while on a weekend camping trip.  Of course, awful original songs are added which only serve to irritate the viewer.  As usual, none of the characters are particularly likeable and the special effects are not that special.  The cast, led by 30 ROCK's Katrina Bowdin and cutey Randy Wayne, are okay but never outstanding.

5370693,3,B009X48448,"Hold Your Breath centers around a group of college aged kids out for a weekend camping trip.  One of them becomes possessed by a spirit that can jump from host to host killing while killing the kids off one by one.

I enjoyed Hold Your Breath. It's not ground breaking or truly scary but it's entertaining. The acting is fine, the characters are somewhat stereo-typical but not to the point of annoying. The effects are a mixture of practical and CGI, neither is overdone. I thought it could have used a little more gore though. It's a fun story about a group of college aged kids going camping. Sure that theme has been done countless times but there's a nice stop at closed prison along the way, some nudity, thank you Erin Marie Hogan. I also like the fact that Katrina Bowden (Tucker and Dale Vs Evil, 30 Rock) wasn't the ""Good Girl"" character this time around.

People that will like this movie. Those who love B Horror Movies and those that love horror comedies. Though this isn't a horror comedy, it's doesn't take itself too serious. One of the characters we meet in the second half has some great lines that are priceless. If you're going to have a horror movie night, this is a good choice for the last film of the night.

I am a huge fan of The Asylum, a production company that churns out a lot of bad movies but some good ones as well. So any time a new one is released I have to have it. That brings us to this film, when it was released a few years ago I was all over it. As it turns out this was a pretty good flick. This one is all about the urban legend about holding your breath when passing by a cemetery.

A group of friends are leaving the city to go on a camping trip, this may be last time they are all together. On their way to the camp site they pass by a cemetery. It just so happens that a serial killer was buried here. So the saying his when passing a cemetery you need to hold your breath so as not to let the evil spirits possess you. Do they all believe in the urban legend or is there someone who laughs it off.

This turned out to be a very enjoyable movie, actually one of the best from Asylum in a while at the time. The film was directed by Jared Cohn who also made a few other Asylum flicks including the excellent Jailbait. I think he did a good job and moved things along nicely. The story was a cool one thanks to the writers Kenny Zinn and Geoff Meed who has written many other Asylum flicks including the excellent 4Closed.

The acting was hit and miss but it didn't ruin anything for me. One of the best things I thought about this flick was a song that played during a montage. The song is by a woman named Chris Cano and it is called Fire & Brimstone, absolutely one of my favorite songs. I recommend you check the song out even if you don't want to see the film. As for special features you get a lot of Asylum trailers for other films and a great behind the scenes making of, as well as a gag reel.",1430265600,,1732,3.9541547277936964

Then the writing, honestly felt like I was listening to dialogue written by a high school student with no passion. Then..... there's the acting, it was literally annoying to watch. I mean even the ""sex"" was irritating to witness. You know when you see someone who's clearly unqualified for their position, and you think ""Who did they &@$* to get there?"", well that's how the whole movie feels, from the acting to writing to directing. I tried to find some saving grace, something about the story or characters or the acting, but couldn't.

8544817,2,B009X48448,"Movie Premise: the spirit of an executed murderer can be released and occupy the body of a living person depending on certain conditions. This can happen, along with the release of other spirits, if you fail to hold your breath while driving past a cemetery. Of course, we know that one bozo will fail to do this thereby releasing the evil spirit which then occupies his body and causes him to commit a horrific murder. The spirit also has the unique ability to transfer to another body thereby protecting itself and keeping up its murder spree. With ludicrous eye gouging (an eye for an eye), this film unfolds with deadly consequences being heaped upon a group of hapless 20 somethings who happen to go camping in the area. Without giving anything away, suffice it to say that the climax of this film turns the entire movie on its head and apparently breaks its own rules. Moreover, a CHEVY SUV that is the original vehicle driven by our not-so-merry band of campers is shown at the end to be a TOYOTA SUV which then turns back to a Chevy SUV and then transforms to the Toyota SUV and back again to the Chevy SUV. Apparently, the spirit of an SUV can also move from one SUV to another though it doesn't gouge your eye out. Also, one of the group who was stabbed in the eye with a stick (the director really loved eye gouging) was told to take it easy and then forgotten. He must have wound up on the cutting room floor. In the end, what we have is a film that comes very close to being a parody of a horror movie; and except for those who enjoy gore, this particular effort is especially ludicrous.",1473638400,,1600,4.390572390572391

8544819,2,B009X48448,"2 1/2 stars (out of 5). Not a terrible horror film, but it really lacks any coherent logic. That is its main flaw --  and that is where most horror films fail. The acting is OK, the special effects are fairly good in most cases, the make-up is excellent (There is a repeated penchant for eyeball gouging.) If you are not a horror fan, you would give this film zero stars.

The scenario is all too typical: 20-somethings piling into an SUV to go on a weekend camping trip. There is gratuitous nudity and a sex scene, which does not have anything to do with the story. The locations are very creepy: abandoned insane asylum, graveyard. These scenes were very atmospheric, and we've seen them before, but we all still love creepy abandoned buildings and old grave yards -- don't we?

The basic premise is that an insane serial murderer was executed at the aforementioned insane  asylum in 1956. And his spirit returns once a year to occupy a body. This spirit can jump from body to body. And the person whose body is being occupied will gruesomely murder anyone who happens across his/her path. OK, none of this makes any sense, and there is no reason given for any of this, and the old asylum guard who reveals this information to the terrified kids is still living in an old house in the woods, near the asylum (apparently as caretaker of the old abandoned building). Once again, none of his story makes too much sense, either. But, I have to say, the old guard gives a very good performance and takes control of the kids. Unfortunately, the writing makes him do and say things that are ridiculous. The writing really takes a turn for the worse toward the end and is a confusing mess.
