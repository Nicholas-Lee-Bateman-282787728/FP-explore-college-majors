735377,4,6303943314,"This story involves the Doctor, on Earth, facing a bunch of hostile Androids, controlled by aliens intent on taking over the Earth, and the Doctor is fooled by android facsimilies of his friens....Sound familiar?  It should.  So far I could be describing the plot to several stories, most  notably Pertwee's 'Spearhead from Space'.  However, this story just goes to  show where you can go with an unoriginal plot.
It is mostly the  performances of Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah and Tom Baker as the good Doctor  that elevate this  beyond it's seemingly 'McStory' status.  This is one of  the best Doctor/Companion combonations ever in the series, so it's no  wonder they spent three seasons together.
More similarities to other  science fiction apparant here.  The scene when the android Doctor and Sarah  emerge from their 'containers' just screams ""Invasion of the Pod  People"".
At worst, 'Android Invasion' is one of the better  formulatic stories, and at best, it's a fun runaround worthy of being  called good Doctor Who!",918000000,,1022,5.0602409638554215

I loved watching them, and now that they're on DVD, it's like I'm a kid again, watching these shows.  I don't care that the stories can be a little hokey, or the costumes or special effects are so silly.  I remember being terrified of the monsters, and eagerly awaiting the next episode.

The Doctor (Tom Baker) and his companion, Sarah Jane Smith (the late Elisabeth Sladen) are heading back to Earth, when they find themselves having missed their landing point.  Appearing near a completely deserted English village that Sarah had visited years before, they seek to discover the mystery of the town, and the nearby space center.

735529,5,6303943314,I have been a fan of Tom Baker who played Doctor Who when I started Doctor Who. This is a good Doctor Who and this one still has Sara Jane in it and of course Doctor Who saves the day again.,1402617600,,190,3.658536585365854
735552,3,6303943314,"I ordered this because it was filmed in the village where I lived in the 1970s. The video is definitely low-budget but I enjoyed
seeing the scenes our family had seen being filmed.",1394755200,,180,4.484848484848484
735553,3,6303943314,"The Android Invasion isn't my favorite Fourth Doctor story, but it has some good points. On the positive side, we have Sara Jane Smith and Brigadeer Leftbridge Stewart giving very good performances. Tom Baker plays the Fourth Doctor quite well, and even does a great job of playing this role when he isn't himself so to speak. These redeeming features are balanced against some really silly rhino-like aliens whose masks actually interfere with the actor's ability to speak their lines clearly. Then there are the androids, which are pretty cheesy when revealed. Then there are the plot holes, like the one-eyed austronaunt who hasn't noticed that he actually has both eyes, and the android that was destroyed or deactivated turning up functional again to be shot in place of a character. So, this episode is sort of a mixed bag.",1379462400,,829,4.928571428571429
735554,5,6303943314,"I have always liked this story, and still remember being scared when I first saw a robot's face fall off!  I like the scenes in the village, before we know just what is up.  More mystery than science fiction.  Tom Baker and Liz Sladen are good as always, and overall this is a good episode for people like me who are not deep into sci-fi.",1375660800,,338,4.1692307692307695
735555,4,6303943314,"For being released in 2012 (on my birthday no less) it has a rather small amount of special features. And of course the aliens totally suck as realizations. They should have been tall, elegant, gentle aliens. But everything else is great about this story.",1371772800,,255,4.818181818181818
735556,4,6303943314,I haven't seen these episodes for several years until I bought the DVD. I found The Android Invasion to be a good story. There are some good moments between the Doctor and Sarah. The story does not have any slow points.,1368921600,,219,4.365853658536586
735557,4,6303943314,"""Is that finger loaded?"" LOL!! Yes, the Tom Baker years were full of hilarious one-liners like that. This story was written by Terry Nation, who was among the best DW writers, tho this wasn't one of his best stories. Nevertheless, the mid-late 1970s (early Baker years) were -- IMO -- the series' golden years.

DailyMotion has this episode avail. for streaming, so you can sample before purchase.

NOTE: I have not purchased ANY pre-recorded version of this episode. One reason is the inconvenient breakup into orig. BBC ""Parts"". On my local PBS station, several years ago, classic DW used to be broadcast, uncut, yet seamlessly edited together into ONE full-length, commercial-free chunk. I recorded this epi on low-rez videotape; but the continuity/sense-of-pace more than makes up for the sub-HD image quality. In fact, this ""movie""-like  all-in-one-go ""format""  of watching DW was my first/only real experience with the series. Comparatively, the orig. BBC ""parted"" version (which was is also how commercial TV and DVD and now on-demand download) seems ...  well ... clunky!",1360972800,,1079,5.25
735558,4,6303943314,"Another great Tom Baker episode with everyone playing a doppleganger.  Tom's acting is wild and unexpected as always. Elizabeth Sladen gives another stearling performance as Sarah Jane Smith. Harry Sullivan, UNIT, aliens taking over the workd, what more do you want?",1360540800,,266,5.487804878048781
735559,5,6303943314,The last time I got to see this episode was in the 80's on PBS.  Technology has improved a lot making this a delight to watch.  The Big Finish produced Doctor Who audio books have gotten Tom Baker to produce some new stories in audio.  One of these stories connected to this one and I wanted to watch it again making both stories more enjoyable.,1355702400,,345,4.276923076923077
735560,5,6303943314,"I always liked this story, even though it didn't have the same feel as the earlier Tom Baker stories on Earth, it's still a good one. The story has just enough mystery and creepiness to keep it going.

Some of the images really make this an excellent program. The twitching man walking quickly towards the cliff; Sarah Jane falling; the empty town and buildings - these are classic images and they are all contained in this one story! Even the Doctor fighting himself is good television!

The problems pointed out by the people who made this program, (THIS MAY GIVE AWAY SOME STORYLINE!!!) such as the eye patch and the guy not realizing his eye hadn't been lost... that relly isn't a problem. It is obvious that some brain-washing took place. Alien brain-washing could be even more intense, so if he believed the story the aliens handed him, it seems rather plausible that he could be brain-washed enough not to realize it wasn't really gone. He'd see a missing eye!

The other, ""supposed"" problem where all the androids are jammed to a halt so how could the doctor use one? Well, he's the Doctor! One zap from his sonic screwdriver and a minor adjustment of a gear and presto! Just because we don't see him actually do this, does not mean that he couldn't have. I know the producers in retrospect make mention of it like it's some big mistake because there was a scene which explained it that was never film, etc., etc. But the audience is more astute than they give them credit for and I think most people wouldn't think this was a mistake at all.

The picture quality is great and the sound quality is good too. The extras are somewhat run-of-the-mill, but enjoyable.

The main reason I give this program 5 stars is because it is a good story that is well executed.

The drawbacks is Tom Baker's raspy voice in some of the exterior footage, the fact that Lethbridge-Stewart does not appear and Ian Marter's last Doctor Who appearance is just too brief!",1332979200,2,1956,4.590257879656161
735561,4,6303943314,"""The Android Invasion"" is an easily overlooked gem from midway through Tom Baker and producer Philip Hinchcliffe's second season. Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes were phasing out the classic villains and UNIT-centered adventures that had dominated the Jon Pertwee years and started bringing in gothic horror- and steampunk-inflected stories that would so transform the series in the next two years.

The Doctor and Sarah land in a wood outside the village of Devesham, located near an important space defense station, which may be leaking radiation. Strange men in white spacesuits take pot shots at them with guns that fire from their fingertips. A soldier from UNIT runs headlong off a cliff. His wallet contains new, uncirculated coins all minted in the same year. Similar coins are found at the pub in the village, which appears completely deserted. Expressionless villagers are later trucked in like mannequins by the white spacemen, and the dead UNIT soldier comes back to life. Meanwhile, the TARDIS mysteriously takes off without the Doctor or Sarah inside. Somebody's obviously up to no good--but who and what?

The above-average script by Terry Nation combines elements of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with the best of The Avengers, a series for which Nation contributed scripts and was script editor its final season. Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen turn in chilling performances as copies of themselves in a story that relies heavily on mystery and psychological menace rather than sophisticated special effects to convey action and suspense. The only unconvincing bits are the rubber-masked aliens behind ""The Android Invasion"" and the androids' poor marksmanship; none of the robots can aim a pistol or machine gun well enough to hit the broad side of a barn, let alone the Doctor at close range.

The Special Features are equally good in this outing: the 30-minute making-of documentary interviews townspeople from East Hagbourne, the village where exterior locations for ""The Android Invasion"" were shot. The production attracted scores of children who gathered from miles around to watch the proceedings and get their pictures taken with Tom Baker, who appeared to relish all the fan attention. In ""Life After Who: Philip Hinchcliffe,"" TV presenter Celina Hinchcliffe interviews her father about series he produced after leaving Doctor Who in 1977, most notably Private Schulz, The Charmer, and The Gravy Train.",1331424000,3,2443,5.323834196891192
735627,5,6303943314,I LIKE ALL DOCTORS I  HAVE DVDS FROM THE OLD DOCTORS TO THE NEW DOCTOR AND SARAH JANE IS ALWAYS A PLUS TO THE MOVIE,1330473600,,115,3.6
735628,5,6303943314,"As the commentary and notes point out, this is the last show in which we see Benton and Harry. Sadly, neither of them has any kind of farewell -- at the time, no one knew that there would be no more UNIT shows.  Harry's last line is ""Twins?"" (should be a good trivia question someday).

I think another reviewer got it spot on when he said that if the title had been different, this could have been a much spookier program... if you didn't know it was about androids from the title, it would have been much a much better show.

I'm not going over the plot; other reviews have done that.  I find this show more enjoyable than ""The Brain of Morbius"" (which I think is the next show).",1330041600,,681,4.2153846153846155
735629,4,6303943314,"This story was the last to feature UNIT (until the Brigadier comes back at a later date). The Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith landed on what they thought was Earth but turned out being a similated planet created by a race of aliens called the Kraals who were planning on invading Earth. The Kraals created a bunch of ""androids"" which they planned on replacing the humans with, plus knocking out all of civilization with a virus, in order to complete their invasion process. Harry Sullivan,Colonel Benton, the Doctor and Sarah Jane were replaced by androids,but back on Earth, the Doctor used his android self to his advantage to stop the Kraal invasion.  Not much of a story but it was delightful, still the same.",1329523200,,709,4.717741935483871
735630,3,6303943314,"My background: long time Whovian who was watched Baker since the old US PBS broadcasts.

I was excited to get yet another Baker episode to add to my collection, but this story was definitely not one of my favorites. I put it into the ""watch it once"" category as I had trouble paying attention and found the villains and general ""menace"" in the plot to be boring and drawn out, much more than is found in other serialized programs from the 70s. Each episode had 5-10 minutes of real ""meat"", and it seemed to be a very repetitive run-hide-run-hide pattern. I never felt the Doctor had a true battle of logic and reason as has become one of his combatitive trademarks when confronting villains.

Happy to watch it? Yes, but just once. I felt zero need to re-watch and I'll probably flip this copy back on eBay on Amazon down the road.

I am always fascinated with the extras as a television history buff, so I do feel that I'm a bit slanted when I say the extras were enjoyable. I feel this is only a DVD for the most die hard fans.

They can't all be winners, and if you are deciding between this or another Who episode, I hope this review will help your decision to prioritize watching something else first.

But do give this a shot. Once.",1329350400,4,1238,4.3652173913043475
735631,5,6303943314,"Great video with high quality on the longest running si-fi show in the world! There are six parts to the show and the cost for the dvd makes it a great buy, over two hours of tom baker sci fi adventure.",1329264000,,202,3.951219512195122
735632,4,6303943314,"As has become normal, the BBC has done an excellent job of refurbishing the original Doctor Who series. Good extras, especially the commentary track.",1328918400,,149,5.25
735633,5,6303943314,"To be honest, I'm quite biased to this story for several reasons.  Tom Baker, Ian Marter, John Levene, Philip Hinchcliffe, Barry Letts, Terry Nation, and the biggest smile goes to Elisabeth Sladen.  Yes, it's properly spelled with an ""S"".  The ""S"" is for star.  Quoted from her autobiography.  But in all fairness, all of them will always be, in front of, as well as behind the camera.

I feel no need to discuss the story line, since anyone who's reading this more than likely knows the story, although I will mention a silly plot point at end of this review, just for laughs.  Rather I prefer to focus on why one should purchase this other than for the sake of merely watching the show on a format that's better than the VHS version.

To me, it's all about the extras.  Mind you, there aren't many.  2|entertain is probably holding off on several of these for a re-release on a later DVD or Blu-Ray.  It seems to be their style lately.  But there is the standard audio commentary, and while it is not exactly gripping, it is indeed informative.  My only regret is that Tom and Lis are not a part of this commentary.  Not knowing when this was recorded, I can only guess that she was still alive at the time of the recording because she was repeatedly referred to in the present tense.  The text commentary also provides an additional layer of information that true fans of the show can appreciate.  ""The Village that Came to Life"", and ""Life After Who Philip Hinchcliffe"", are two very informative and interesting extras for which I am grateful for their inclusion to this DVD.  In my humble opinion, both are a ""Must Watch.""

Now, not to spoil this release, but here's the silly plot point I refereed to.  While realistically, we all know that not all stories dot all their ""i's"" and cross all their ""t's"", neither back in 1975 nor now in 2012.  But anyone who wears an eye patch for two years and never noticed that under said eye patch, their eye was under it, AND IN TACT... Seriously?  Did he sleep and bathe with that thing on all that time?  Even one of the commentators brought that up.

Oh well.  My bottom line is to watch, enjoy, and be sure to spend time with the extras.",1326758400,,2185,4.445843828715366
735634,5,6303943314,"Ok, so this is often sited as a weak story in an otherwise strong season. But, I have to admit, it remains a favourite of mine as it was the first Doctor Who I ever watched. Of course, it was the first time I saw Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah. The rest is history.",1322870400,3,260,3.9245283018867925
735635,4,6303943314,"Slagged as the worst of the season, it's actually a very good action-thriller.  It starts off with a very creepy first episode, then an extremely hostile second episode, a devious third episode, and the fourth is the resolve.  What's so bad about it?  Almost nothing, aside from some small questions let go at the end of the last episode leaving the viewer to assume how everything was tidied up.

One of the greatest strengths of this episode is that it moves.  Most Doctor Who stories dwell and retrace in order to save money on sets and costumes.  Android Invasion cleverly revisits familiar areas in the final episode, but they are now actual locations instead of imitations. There's always a chase or some gun play or confrontation through the entire story, which is Terry Nation's strength as a writer.  All the elements are bizarre, the entire world twisted to be completely hostile toward the Doctor and Sarah.  It makes this story highly entertaining.

The DVD will most likely not have the best possible commentary they ever could have had on a Doctor Who DVD: Hinchcliffe, Letts, Baker and Sladen.  Sadly, Sladen and Letts passed away in the last year.",1318204800,6,1163,4.828282828282828
735636,4,6303943314,"It's not top notch Dr. Who....

My girlfriend and I enjoyed it alot.",1299542400,2,135,4.4
735697,4,6303943314,"Ah, Season Thirteen.  No robot dogs, no Mary Whitehouse's Revenge, no Star Wars on the horizon.  Bliss.  Just think...

The Scottish one, with the wonderful whispering aliens.
The claustraphobic one with Frederick Jaeger.
That really good Egyptian one filmed in Mick Jagger's house.
Philip Madoc and the thing made from bits of different aliens.
And the really scary one with the killer vegetables.
Sigh.

Hang on.  That's only five stories.  There should be six.  Wait a minute.  Zygons, Evil, Pyramids...  Oh yes.  'The Android Invasion'.  The runt of the Season Thirteen litter.  The single shrug in a season of enthusiastic waving.

What makes it the ghost at the wedding?  One answer and one answer only: the title.  Fair enough, as a story it makes no sense but (notoriously) the plot of 'Pyramids of Mars' doesn't either, which didn't stop it being an undisputed classic.  Okay, the principal enemy sound like (indeed are) the cast of 70s children's show `Rainbow' but the most scary thing about 'Terror of the Zygons' turns out to be a glove puppet.  Yes, Faraday is no worthy replacement for Lethbridge-Stewart but nor is Beresford in 'The Seeds of Doom'.  Fine, there was the absence of any really challenging alien presence but the same could be said of 'Planet of Evil'.  And, what's more, the Sisterhood of Karn in 'The Brain of Morbius' are far more tedious than anything the supporting cast of 'The Android Invasion' can boast.

So it's not that bad then?  No, I don't think it is.  It's entire problem is just that you know what's going on before anything even happens.  There it is in big letters: 'The Android Invasion' by Terry Nation.

So it is that wonderfully bizarre events are rendered predictable from the very start.  All that new-Doctor, old-style, all that Tom Baker wit, all that strange England, wasted.  Without the title it is my contention that episode one would now be considered a classic opener, dragging the rest of the story with it to glory.
You don't believe me?  Watch it again and make a list of all the things you can't explain if you hadn't already been told it's all about androids and invasion.  I've tried it.  The list is huge.  Odd, twisty UNIT soldier, ""Stop man, stop!"" identical coinage, ""something seems to have annoyed them again"", the silent pub...  If you hadn't been aware of the `A' word, 'The Android Invasion' would have stayed in the mind as a baffling, wetting-the-pants-in-expectation moment, somewhere in that misty changing from autumn to winter, 1975.  (And it is in good company: 'The Robots of Death' is a similar titular faux-pas.)

Of all the things I would do to revise the programme's entire past if I had the power, I would change the name of 'The Android Invasion' to `Devesham', the utterance of which is the story's first point of recognition, even though it is a false one.  A great and an unusual title.  (So much better than `Terror of Evil Doom' don't you think?)

Okay, perhaps there is one other thing that 'The Android Invasion' needs to redeem itself: no, not CGI (though that might help) but a gigantic pair of scissors.  There are so many lazy little fillers that have no dramatic function whatsoever: the too-early introduction of the Kraals in part one or the demonstration of the special android to attack Kraals to name but two.  Get rid of 'em.  Sod reverence; the whole thing trimmed down to three parts (or even two) by expert hands would do the world of good.  Future generations looking back on this awesome era in the show's time on Earth, could have the thrill that this programme should have given.  No one but us would know...",1286064000,5,3625,4.752808988764045
735698,4,6303943314,"I have to agree with everyone who says this is the weakest story in arguably the best season of Doctor Who.  Perhaps if this story were in another season, it would be more highly regarded.  It is not a bad story, just not that great.  Guy Crayford was at best annoying.  How could someone not know his eye is not missing? Just remove the patch and look in the mirror.  Hellooo...  In addition, unfortunately, Nicholas Courtney had prior committments, therefore couldn't reprise his role as the brigadier.

On the positive side, the atmospheric element is great. The deserted English village, although fake, conveys a sense of eeriness. The Androids' lack of emotion is exceptionally chilling in itself, very well-acted.

I was also not impressed with the sound quality of the VHS.  My copy had static at certain points throughout the tape.  Some spots suffered so badly that if it weren't for the closed caption, I wouldn't have been able to understand what was said.  Did anyone else have this problem, or do I simply have a bad copy?",1095379200,2,1035,4.758426966292135
735699,3,6303943314,"When Sarah Jane asks the Doctor if they are on Earth, the Doctor answers ""possibly.""  Part of this has to do with the high radiation reading he gets from an instrument.
However, they see a UNIT corporal commit suicide over a cliff, and upon closer examination discover he has all newly minted coins and bills in his wallet.  Upon closer examination of the village of Devesham, which Sarah recognizes, they discover it deserted.  When people do appear, they do so in a robotic, clockwork fashion.  Among those in the pub is none other than the corporal, alive and well!  Sarah gets off a parting shot at his expense:  ""I don't you think you should be drinking so soon after breaking your neck.""
Both decide to explore the Space Defense Station a mile from the pub, where to their bewilderment, they find their friends, Mr. Benton and Harry Sullivan, under orders to hunt them down.  To add to the mystery, they are being led by Guy Crayford, an astronaut testing a new space freighter XK-5 who vanished, presumably killed by a colliding asteroid.  ""All our friends led by a dead man,"" the Doctor observes wryly.  But Crayford is under the thrall of Styggron, a strange alien resembling a cross between a rhino and a boar.
The military vs scientists motif is explored as Styggron puts the emphasis on science as the thing that will help his fellow Kraals, while Marshall Chedaki insists on military might.  All I can say is that if Chedaki were in charge of the operation, the Earth wouldn't stand a chance, as Styggron makes mistake after mistake.  Chedaki's analysis of the Doctor as someone who has a history of supporting libertarian causes is half-accurate--I'd include a ""left"" in front of ""libertarian.""
The astronaut-suited androids with index finger guns is a revamp of the Autons, whose hands dropped down to reveal guns.  At one point, the Doctor looks at a robot pointing its gun at him, and asks ""Is that finger loaded?""
In the Phillip Hinchcliffe's gothic regime, this is a take on the original movie of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, down to the black pods and duplicates, and the paranoid atmosphere that anyone could be a duplicate.  Barry Letts, who was Hinchcliffe's predecessor as producer, directs this one!
Continuity errors irk me to no end, and here's one.  The bogus calendar in the village reads 6 July Friday.  This is a problem if one considers the UNIT and contemporary Earth stories to be set in the exact year the story was broadcast.  This aired from 22 November to 13 December 1975.  The closest years with the calendar structure is 1973 or 1979.  It can't be 1973, as the Doctor is still in his third incarnation, and it can't be 1979, as the Brigadier has retired by then.  He is still in action in this story.  The only possible explanation is that the Kraals first conceived of the plan on 6 July 1973, which would fit Crayford's disappearance two years ago.  OK, that's sorted out then.  Whew!
There are a few good moments, such as an android Sarah's faceplate falling off to reveal circuits beneath, and the difference seen between the cold emotionless robots and the actual humans with warmth and feeling.
This is the last series appearances of John Levene (Benton) and Ian Marter (Harry), the latter having died suddenly at his home in 1986.
While owing a lot to its sci-fi roots, The Android Invasion has consistency errors, all regarding the Kraal plans and the androids.  Their plan make the use of androids redundant, so why use them?  Not one of the better Fourth Doctor stories.",1075248000,3,3524,4.729950900163666
735700,5,6303943314,"As others have pointed out this is rather a standard android invasion type story with worked in rehashed pulp science fiction props and plots.
Having said that it is more of a comic horror type of story with Tom Baker literally hamming it up throughout. From the early moaning and groaning from Sarah Jane (are we there yet, are we there yet Type of complaining about getting back home) to the Marie celeste type village - could be in Epcot - through to the twisted Sontaran type aliens there is a lot of tongue in cheek humour.  This also is a bit of a prototype of the later, not as good, Peter Davison story 'Four to Doomsady' which has a number of similarities but not as good sets or location.
This story is quite droll and if it was to be taken too seriously then I must admit it would not be such a good tale. I have not seen such a Doctor Who where Tom Baker is in such good comic form. It reminds me of a later UK tv show where he played a house doctor and obviously had a lot of fun doing it.
Do not judge this story too harshly. Given the context of the other stories of the season and the Tom Baker series it would not be terribly logical to broadcast a dummy.
Watch it in lightheart and you will get much enjoyment from it.
Originally broadcast 22 November to 13 December 1975.",1025395200,5,1290,4.180722891566265
735701,5,6303943314,"I truly enjoy the earlier Tom Baker (Sarah Jane) episodes.  ""The Android Invasion"" is a wonderful example (when he actually wore the hat) and a great performance by Liz Sladen as they arrive and explore a seemingly deserted English village.  When I sit down to watch a Dr Who, I often find myself reaching for this tape.  The story has a special charm that is difficult to explain.  I would recommend that all Dr Who fans add ""The Android Invasion"" to their library. It is one of my very favorite episodes!",1010188800,31,506,4.527472527472527
735702,3,6303943314,"This is one of those ""pretty good"" stories that had the great misfortune to fall into an excellent season. The story is remarkably typical (and amazingly similar to the basic plot of ""Terror of the Zygons"", just three adventures earlier!), and quite a bit of the supporting acting merely average, but there -is- a nice sense of fun throughout all four episodes. Tom Baker and Lis Sladen continue to work very well together, and this leads to a number of nice moments; plus, the final appearances of John Levene and Ian Marter as Benton and Harry are nicely done. The androids themselves are well-realised (although more than a bit like the Autons from the Pertwee era), and the stunt double stuff in the final episode is fairly painless. Also, part 2 boasts a really classic cliffhanger everyone remembers!
Unfortunately, there's also a bad side. It's very regrettable that Nicholas Courtney couldn't return as the Brigadier; instead, he's been replaced with a carbon copy character played only decently by Patrick Newell of ""The Avengers"" fame. That's not to say the other supporting cast are anything to boast about, either...in fact, they seem to just be walking through the lines. On the design front, the Kraals' outfits are some of the worst in a long time, instantly revealing that there are perfectly human men inside them.
This is not a total loss of a story - in fact, it's good fun in many places; that doesn't make up for the fact, though, that it's very standard, and sticks out rather obviously amongst so many great stories.",995846400,3,1539,4.833333333333333
735703,3,6303943314,"This Tom Baker story is the odd one out in a season widely regarded as one of Doctor Who's best. The middle of Philip Hinchcliffe's reign as producer, the 13th season is filled with memorable sci-fi tales with healthy doses of suspense and horror. In contrast, ""The Android Invasion"" is the most straightforward adventure, without any real finesse, making it stand out like the proverbial sore thumb. It is certainly not a bad story - but on the other hand, it is not spectacular. It is a standard alien invasion of Earth story, with a plot that doesn't challenge or enthrall. It is basically a rip-off of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (although the rest of the season's stories were similar rip-offs of classic tales, but more stylishly done) and is very predictable, with a few gaping plotholes. However, while all I have written so far indicates that I loathe the story, in actual fact I have a soft spot for it. It was one of the first stories I saw, 21 years ago (my, how time flies) and some scenes rest vividly in my mind. The androids shooting bullets out of their fingers; Sarah Jane's face falling off to reveal the android; the deserted village; the incredibly ugly (but well designed) Kraals. These aspects always made repeat viewings welcome. There are other positive elements to the story: the location work, especially in and around the village, is excellent and the direction (by former producer Barry Letts) is very good. UNIT allies Harry Sullivan and RSM Benton make their swansong Doctor Who appearances, while Martin Friend's Styggron is also well portrayed. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for Milton Johns' Guy Crayford - any role Johns has played in the programme (Benik in ""The Enemy of the World"" and Kelner in ""The Invasion of Time"" are the other two I can recall) are especially camp - this performance is no exception, giving an irritating edge to what is essentially an interesting and sympathetic character (surely he must have known his eye wasn't missing, either! - another piece of credibility stretching). The final episode is also a rather boring runaround, with a routine ending and effects that are less than spectacular (quite run of the mill for Doctor Who, but the ""android freezing"" scenes are cringeworthy!) However, in a certain context, with a strong measure of nostalgia and a not too serious countenance, ""The Android Invasion"" can be enjoyed.",989452800,3,2397,4.877450980392157
735704,4,6303943314,"If this had been made a few years later in Tom Baker's years as the Doctor, it would have been far by the best adventure of the season, but in the classic-filled years of Hinchcliffe/Holmes, it comes across as pretty  ordinary.
That's not to say it's a bad story.  On the contrary, it's very  enjoyable and filled with nice touches of humour, not to mention memorable  scenes such as the sinister android version of Sarah, the return of (most  of) UNIT, good location work, the rhino-faced aliens and the plan to  replace human beings with mechanicals.  Don't expect a classic adventure on  the same level as 'Pyramids of Mars' or 'Genesis of the Daleks', but you  won't be disappointed either.",960768000,3,694,4.716666666666667
