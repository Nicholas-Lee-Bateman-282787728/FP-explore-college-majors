4153573,5,B003LPV93S,My Great-granddaughter (34 months old) and I love this movie.  Ran across it on Netflix one day watched it a couple of times then it was gone.

4153575,5,B003LPV93S,"As an elementary school Art Teacher, the kids love it. Although some of the words/terms are a bit advanced for some of my studenys, the movie is really fun and cute. I first saw it when another Art Teacher showed it through Netflix. Eventually I needed it for myself so I rented then purchased it through Amazon.  One of my classes was really colorful in their personalities, they would just burst out with the theme song during class. I last showed it about a week ago and I'm still singing the theme song which is kinda of sentimental.",1466208000,,537,4.479591836734694

4153582,5,B003LPV93S,"We found this movie on Netflix last year when my daughter just barely 2. She watches it several times a week and she learned her primary colors from the movie!  To this day I am still in awe that she recognizes and names at least 9 colors, all from watching this movie. I was surprised when she was asking to watch ""yellow"". I figured out what she was asking for after watching the movie, I mean actually watching it, one day. Needless to say, yellow is her favorite color and she asks for the yellow crayon every time we bring out the crayon box.",1453852800,,547,4.259615384615385

4153585,5,B003LPV93S,My toddler likes this movie so much that she will watch it over and over again singing along the songs.

4153595,4,B003LPV93S,"I wasn't sure exactly how many stars to give this. It was a well done movie and the animation is very good. The stroyline is pretty good, but this movie is definitely for little kids! I did not know this when purchasing it. The review I read (not on Amazon) did not make it clear that this definitely for kids. That said, I will say that I generally enjoy watching children's movies. I love Veggie Tales and others because they are written to have appeal to a very wide age range. I don't feel that this movie has any appeal for adults or even older children. However the young ones we showed it to thought it was great.",1420761600,2,620,4.262711864406779

4153598,5,B003LPV93S,My grandchildren are 5 and 2 and they love it. My daughter says they want to see it over and over! I watched it before I mailed it to them and it was a delightful movie for all the ages. Fun!!,1418688000,,192,3.707317073170732
4153599,5,B003LPV93S,"I took my 3-year-old daughter to see this movie in the theater.  She loved it!  A few months later, she's still talking about the crayons who come to life and how she wants to see it again.  I just bought the DVD for her.  This movie is bright, colorful, and perfect for very young kids.",1417564800,,287,4.163636363636364
4153600,4,B003LPV93S,"If you don't follow animation very closely -- and even if you do -- you have to be a discerning consumer nowadays. Even the shoddiest animated features can have celebrity voices and look good on their packages. That's not to say that low-budget features are not worth considering, however. Some high-budget features can emanate fumes, too. The thing to consider is how the filmmakers were able to make the most with what they had.

Such is the case with THE HERO OF COLOR CITY, a new animated feature that enjoyed a limited run before arriving on video today. It's a warmhearted, entertaining feature with modest pretentions that, like TOY STORY, anthromorphosizes a beloved household plaything: crayons.

""Well, then it's just TOY STORY with crayons, right?"" Yes and no. There were several animated films about living toys before TOY STORY, so to call it a rip-off would be hasty without seeing it.

While THE HERO OF COLOR CITY does focus on the familiar theme of ""facing your fears"" (which also worked nicely in TOY STORY OF TERROR!), COLOR CITY offers a new ""box"" of characters and a new magical land of colors, in which the bad guys are seeking to add color to themselves at any cost.

What the film has going for it is a story line just absorbing enough to sustain a feature (not an easy nor always successful task), well-cast voices -- including (Owen Wilson, Christina Ricci and the always interesting Craig Ferguson as well as voice acting vets like Jess Harnell, Tara Strong and David Kaye), a pleasant musical score and peppy songs.

It's does not go for the satiric bite of THE LEGO MOVIE, nor does it make the attempt. This is a nice movie for families and kids. And to quote Rodgers and Hammerstein, ""All the rest is talk.""

When I was a kid, for Christmas my Dad gave me huge box of crayons with activity books. It paled next to the flashier toys and I'll always feel a little bad because I made very little fuss about it. But in the ensuing months, that became the gift that kept on giving long after the other gifts lost their luster.

So crack open a 64-pack (with sharpener), open a huge pad of drawing paper and color along.",1417478400,7,2144,4.596858638743456
4153601,5,B003LPV93S,The kids loved it! They watch it over and over. Adorable crayon figures they fell in love with.  Best for kids under 8 or 9.,1417478400,2,124,3.96

That being said, my little one loves it and will stayed occupied watching it and for that I will say makes this movie worth it. Its good for very young children (0-4ish) and all the colorful scenes and bad songs will hold their attention.",1526083200,,364,4.447761194029851

It has so much potential to keep going with stories, adventures, and of course the great songs. This is part of my teaching regime for my two daughters (21 months & 8 months). It's bright and colorful and has catchy songs. Great way to teach about colors and coloring.",1494374400,,385,4.216216216216216
