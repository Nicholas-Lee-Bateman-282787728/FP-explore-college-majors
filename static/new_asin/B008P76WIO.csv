8529436,5,B008P76WIO,"The Amazon review I quote above captures the translucent brilliance of Kylians choreography. This DVD offers some of the most haunting sequences in all of contemporary dance: it is worth getting for Sarabande and Petite Mort alone. For lovers of dance, Kylian needs no introduction of course. To othersand I first watched this with a man with no particular interest in danceyou are in for a discovery! There are many excellent choreographers out there, but Kylians Mozart-like lucidity is in a league of its own.",1467158400,3,512,5.035294117647059
