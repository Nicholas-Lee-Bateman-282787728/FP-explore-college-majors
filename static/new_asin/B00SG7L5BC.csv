6983722,4,B00SG7L5BC,"I purchased this for my sister's 80th birthday and enjoyed watching it with my brothers and family.  It was a delightful
resurgence of memories from the past.  We all delighted in commenting and reliving what seemed like only a ""few"" years ago.
Some have criticized that the snipets of acts were too short - we actually enjoyed most of them as snipets - and not too long.
The DVD's are lengthy and there's plenty to digest.",1448064000,4,423,4.552631578947368

6983725,2,B00SG7L5BC,"I read the contents of this set and I was excited... so many great performers and six disks... what could go wrong? Well, the problem is that the people who made this set couldn't leave well enough alone. They felt the need to turn the DVDs into shows of their own with modern talking head interviews and edited performances bookending the talking heads. It felt like the supplementary documentary without the main feature.

If you are interested in the performances, forget it. It's basically verse chorus CUT! back to the talking head. Nothing is played out from beginning to end as it was on the show. I can't believe Time Life thinks this is what people want. Their Grand Ol Opry set had the talking heads, but at least the songs were complete.",1437782400,58,748,4.62406015037594
6983726,2,B00SG7L5BC,Short clips of performances and running commentary by Carol Burnett a turn off. It felt more like a TV advertisement,1436572800,16,116,4.85
6983727,3,B00SG7L5BC,"Today we have America's Got Talent with Nick Cannon and Judges Howard Stern, Howie Mandell, Mel B and Heidi Klum. But this is the original talent show or should I say a rreaaaalllly biiiig shoooe,

This is okay nostalgic entertainment, for die-hard fans only,  just over 7 hours spread over 6 discs, so the packaging is a bit overproduced and consequently overpriced, it's as if all 7 hours could have fit onto 1 or 2 discs, these seem to be compilations of PBS specials.  I would have liked to have seen more musical performances, some of the clips only presented part of a song and the first 2 discs had quite a few of the same performers. There are still a few memorable moments, especially seeing Jackie Mason giving Ed the finger, Sonny & Cher singing 'I Got You Babe' and the Doors only appearance  doing 'Light My Fire'. But for this price, I would have expected at least 20 hours of entertainment. And the picture/audio quality leaves a LOT to be desired.

This is what you get. a 4 page leaflet is included with the descriptions.

Disc 1 - Unforgettable Performancees (1:15) - The BEST Disc

Carol Burnett hosts this disc with performances by Elvis, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz,Barbra Streisand, Bobby Darin, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and others. An extra bonus feature is an interview with Ed & Sylvia Sullivan, the only surviving camera interview.

Disc 2 - 50th Anniversary Special (0:45)

The Smothers Brothers host this show include George Carlin,Richard Pryor,Marlon Brando,Humphrey Bogart,Fred Astaire,Sonny&Cher,Jackson 5, The Supremes,The Beatles,Elvis,Janis Joplin,The Byrds and more. The interview with Ed & Sylvia Sullivan is repeated again on this disc...which is only 45 minutes long! - I thought only IMAX had the nerve to put out such a short DVD.

Disc 3 - The All-Star Comedy Special (1:15)

Mary Tyler Moore introduces performances by Jack Benny,Milton Berle,Carol Burnette,George Carlin,Moms Mabley,Phyllis Diller,Bob Hope,Rodney Dangerfield,Richard Pryor,Joan Rivers,The Smothers Brothers and more.

Disc 4 - World's Greatest Novelty Acts (0:55)
Includes spinners, jugglers, contortionists, balancing acts, gymnasts and acrobats There's no host on this one, probably did not make the PBS Specials. Some mediocre fuzzy picture/audio quality on many of these acts takes away from the performances, one guy eating and smoking cigarettes and swallowing /ejecting objects from his mouth was a bit interesting.

Disc 5 -  Amazing Animal Acts (1:00)

Includes bears,stallions, birds,chimps , dogs , tigers, lions.  Again no host and probably not a PBS special and like the previous disc, a lot of poor fuzzy audio/picture quality - you could say this one's for the dogs.

Disc 6 - Bonus Interviews (1:55)

With Alan King, John Byner,Rich Little,Gwen Verdon,Flip Wilson,Phyllis Diller,Will Jordan,Carol Lawrence, Jack Carter, David Crosby,Dick Martin,Ray Manzarek,Michelle Phillips,Joan Rivers,Steve Allen, Marlo Lewis,Shari Lewis, Ella Fitzgerald,Milton Berle,Smokey Robinson,Shecky Greene,Johnny Mathis,Jackie Mason and Senor Wences.

Now I really wouldn't call these interviews, they're actually editted clips/memoirs by the above listed performers talking to some unseen interviewer or just to a camera, so don't expect to hear anything controversial or exciting, I would have rather seen actual clips from their performances instead than just hearing 2 hours of rambling reminiscing about Ed Sullivan, I actually was doing puzzles while this DVD was playing because all these people were just talking while seated, there's no clips or anything else going on, quite disappointing.

On the Amazon blurb it says 'From over 1,000 hours of classic television....', so is this all it could afford to give us ?, there is enough room on 6 discs for 25 + hours of entertainment, what you would expect when paying $35 or more for a DVD compilation, and considering the substandard quality of this set, and that we've already seen the Elvis/Beatles/Rolling Stones/Jackson 5 clips on so many other Ed Sullivan specials, I would not really expect to be charged this much for this set, around $10 would be a fair price.

So overall, I could not really recommend this package, there's even an extra disc holder for an additional 2 discs, like there were supposed to be 8 included, however the main problem is the poor to mediocre picture/audio quality and not enough of the big stars.",1432598400,44,4445,5.258840169731259
6983728,5,B00SG7L5BC,"The Ed Sullivan Show had a 23-year-long run on CBS, was a fixture on Sunday evenings, and featured a wide variety of acts that would appeal to all members of the family. Eds guests could range from the stars of current Broadway shows, ballet dancers, singers performing their hit singles, acrobats, comedians, animal acts, and even the puppet Topo Gigio. Sullivan, a newspaperman who had gained experience putting vaudeville-type shows together, was the weekly host. Stiff, often looking awkward, he nonetheless knew how to get the hottest acts in show business. Famously, The Beatles made their first appearance on American television on this show.

The Best of the Ed Sullivan Show is a 6-disc collection of appearances by some of show business biggest names, including Barbra Streisand, Marlon Brando, Carol Burnett, Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason, The Smothers Brothers, Flip Wilson, Lucille Ball, Janis Joplin, Phyllis Diller, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Rich Little, Johnny Mathis, Smokey Robinson, and Bob Hope. Perennial Sullivan guest star Senor Wences is also included.",1431302400,2,1080,5.390532544378698

..........................................................................................................................
For a disc's ""table-of-contents"", either Google the individual disc titles, or check Amazon's DVD-listings. I recommend you do the later.
Amazon's search-engine will ALSO tell you IF, and WHEN you [already] bought something [I did with three of these titles, but one of
THESE discs was L=O=N=G=E=R, so, I didn't mind passing my duplicates along to a friend].
..........................................................................................................................
I re-cased the four DVD cases into 2 [9-disc] larger cases. Often, larger collections will use standard cases that hold 8; 10; 12; 14 discs,
but have less..... look through some of your video-library storage stuff. Maybe you can just do a little swapping of existing cases.",1524787200,6,1971,6.276752767527675

8698277,1,B00SG7L5BC,"Once I saw that Time Life was behind this I was kind of excited but man was I in for a major disappointment. Is advertised as ""The Best of The Ed Sullivan Show"" which is not. I thought it was going to be like the Sofa release but is not, It feels more like one of those pre-paid advertisements that you watch on TV which the songs are just bits and pieces so nothing is complete as it was on the show. Plus mostly everything is in B/W and I didn't see many of the artists that the cover shows. Also, everything is by section so once you go into a section there is no chapter so if you want to hear the incomplete performance of Petula Clark of ""My Love"" you would have to listen to any performance that is ahead of it. Time Life really drop the ball on this one. It was a major disappointment.",1485388800,20,793,4.025316455696203
