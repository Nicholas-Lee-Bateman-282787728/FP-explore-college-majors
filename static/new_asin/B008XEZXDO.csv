5189439,4,B008XEZXDO,Poorly written and directed with great talent gone to waste. I love Justin Kirk and I really felt sorry for him as he tried to make his character work with other actors that show so little experience.,1371686400,,200,4.4324324324324325
5189440,1,B008XEZXDO,"It does not even rate one star! What a waste of money and time, did not even watch half
the movie.",1366502400,,98,3.7142857142857144
5189441,4,B008XEZXDO,"Loved this movie! Beautifully shot, well-acted and nice vicarious feel of being sexy in NYC. Romantic, funny, sweet, quirky and Hot. Do watch if you like indie, foreign or non-Hollywood blockbuster type films. Great soundtrack, very alluring actors and a unique, enigmatic story. Albeit, slightly choppy and with some seemingly irrelevant scenes; pointless and purposeless, mundane or extreme content at times, just like real life.",1350000000,6,431,5.6461538461538465
5189442,1,B008XEZXDO,"Save your money! This movie was bland at best. The so called sexual content is practically non-existent and the story really doesn't flow well. The characters lives intertwine, but the flow is choppy and doesn't make me want to keep watching. I almost shut it off but figured I should at least watch it since I paid to rent it. The 4 star review is a sham...I wouldn't watch it again and I certainly wouldn't pay money to see this.",1343001600,10,431,4.4
5189443,4,B008XEZXDO,"It's Summer in New York and many are not too happy about the heat wave. However, 'steamy encounters' begin to cross the same path as relationships grow as wild and hot as the weather. Funny, Entertaining from start to finish, Good Acting Performance. Highly Recommended for romance and comedy lovers!",1342915200,3,300,5.02
5189444,3,B008XEZXDO,Interesting story but the director could have done a better job of really tying the different characters together or given more of a reason to care about them.,1462406400,,159,4.714285714285714

5189449,1,B008XEZXDO,It wasn't very good. I don't even think I watched the whole thing.,1461715200,,66,4.153846153846154

5189453,2,B008XEZXDO,C-movie. No plot. etc.,1461110400,,22,4.75
5189454,1,B008XEZXDO,Another bad one!,1461110400,,16,4.666666666666667
5189455,2,B008XEZXDO,Wonderful cast badly served by the story. Propelled less by plot than by a screenwriter's trope. Feel's like it is trying to make a point but never makes one beyond the inter-connectedness of NYC.,1461024000,,196,4.794117647058823
5189456,2,B008XEZXDO,Very bad,1459209600,,8,3.5

5189458,5,B008XEZXDO,"I'd never heard of this movie but  I recognized some of the actor's names so I watched. What a pleasant surprise!. Lovely  vignettes of relationships surgically opened to us @ the precise moment people come together, then, go their separate ways. I thoroughly enjoyed watching each of these fine actors work their craft, mesmerizing slipping into these private intimate places. Outstanding cast! the whole thing looked beautiful, playing with  textures & space, light & dark, NYC beautifully stylized & the stream of people, traffic, music  that carry us to the next story. Seamless.  The bike sequence was a revelation, I never understood why anyone would want to ride a bike in NYC. Oh...and the music....brilliant...well...bottom line: this movie is a gem! I think it's hard for films like this to compete with the block buster mentality that dominates the box office. Many of the actors in this film have been successful in the block buster genre too. But only actors with serious chops can pull off working so close in, depending on the dialogue and each other to do make the story live. Bravo!",1458604800,,1099,4.951086956521739
5189459,5,B008XEZXDO,Great,1453680000,,5,5.0
5189460,2,B008XEZXDO,Plot nonexistent.  Acting mediocre.  Not particularly sexy.  Not a good movie.,1440115200,,78,5.909090909090909
5189461,1,B008XEZXDO,OMG....boring...stupid.....waste of material putting it on DVD.  Spare yourself...don't  waste your money or your time.,1435536000,,119,6.866666666666666
5189462,3,B008XEZXDO,"The movie did not interest me, I just rented it to see Lee Pace, which was only about 15 minutes. His part was great.",1421712000,7,117,3.9166666666666665
5189463,3,B008XEZXDO,Rented movie and it was ok.,1411603200,,27,3.6666666666666665
5189464,1,B008XEZXDO,"It has no sense, bad script, bad performances, boring......
I think that the director had no idea of how to take forward such work.
Only hold this movie because Lee Pace is in it (by the way, I don't  understand why he participated in this mess)
Don't waste your time and your money on this, there are many best indie films.",1409875200,,324,4.311475409836065
5189465,3,B008XEZXDO,"I can't watch this movie good enough because I don't know the movie was made that way or not?  The picture is not clear, dark, and moving off and on. so I miss all of my perception",1400716800,,180,3.864864864864865
5189466,2,B008XEZXDO,"The overall idea of the movie is interesting, but the quality of the story of each couple varies hugely, making the movie interesting at times and not so interesting (or even somewhat weird...) some other times.  Some of the plots didn't work for me at all (for example, the three blue roses and a small yellow lemon).  Some of them are intriguing enough that I wish there is more time for those stories to develop further.  Overall, the movie was okay.  It could be better, but it is what it is!",1377129600,,496,4.417582417582418
5189467,1,B008XEZXDO,This was a movie that was not a movie -----just a mess consisting of poor writing and worse editing. What was the point?,1375574400,3,120,4.260869565217392
5189468,3,B008XEZXDO,It was sexy but thin on story.  Interesting how the characters lives intertwined.  One character from a sexual liaison would move on to a new partner and each new coupling occurred by chance.,1375228800,,191,4.757575757575758
5189469,2,B008XEZXDO,Could have been better. Some of the story lines didn't make sense. Only watched it because I love lee pace.,1374796800,6,107,4.4
5189470,3,B008XEZXDO,"It's not bad but it's not great. AWESOME SOUNDTRACK. And great use of NY. If you're a NYer you can relate to the places, the style. The writing wasn't the best which is a shame because it's a pretty good cast.",1374278400,2,209,4.121951219512195
5189471,1,B008XEZXDO,this movie was so boring I turned it off after about 15 minutes. terrible acting just plain a plan boring movie,1372982400,2,111,4.333333333333333
5189472,1,B008XEZXDO,"this movie only had one or two good parts. It was not a horrible movie, just one that I could have done without seeing.",1372550400,2,119,4.0
5189473,1,B008XEZXDO,Pretty much a waste of anyone's time. Episodes don't seem to connect in any meaningful way.  Couldn't get involved in any of them.,1372204800,,130,4.6521739130434785
8532155,4,B008XEZXDO,"Nice surprise after seeing the reviews.  If you don't expect violence, drama or blatant sex scenes, this is a good movie for it's interesting characters placed in varied vignettes.  All about lightly connecting and moving on...until the final scene. I liked all the actors and the directing.  Not at all boring and I'm glad I stumbled on this.",1485993600,,343,4.879310344827586
8532156,3,B008XEZXDO,"OK three stars is kind because they made such a poor choice to not spend any money on a decent camera and lens for this movie. It takes away any validity, and just makes a million dollar movie look like a $350 student film, it was shocking how they overlooked something that important. I don't know if this was a director misstep, the director or producer probably was very misguided in thinking they could spend all the budget on actors and locations, and they probably spent $1000 top to rent that DSLR or whatever they shot this on. My Panasonic LUMIX DSLR can shoot better quality, it was lit competently so it's not that the DP didn't know what they were doing, it's that they didn't give him any budget at all for a camera. Very odd, cause it's hard to take seriously, it looks like a film school job. If they were going for grainy, there's a way to get grainy without looking just cheap in a bad way, which is what resulted here.",1482710400,,936,4.354285714285714
