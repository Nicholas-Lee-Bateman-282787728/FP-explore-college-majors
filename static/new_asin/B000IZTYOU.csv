8148131,5,B000IZTYOU,"Another in a excellent series of three DVDs that focus on the basic belly dance moves that form the foundation of the art of belly dance.  Not only are these for the beginner but also good reference material for the more advanced dancer.  While the DVDs in this series are structured for the beginner, they are also useful for the dancer who wants to drill his/her basic moves to keep them crisp.  As with the other DVDs, it not only  contains a clear and easy explanation of each move but also a easy routine that uses the moves demonstrated, giving the beginning student a sense of how to connect the moves.

Once again, IAMED goes beyond what most other DVDs offer, not only does it include a dynamic stand alone workout designed for the belly dancer but also two performances in costume, one by Paulina and another by Anaheed.  I would highly recommend the series!",1350345600,,868,4.567741935483871
8148132,5,B000IZTYOU,"I just purchased this DVD and it really is one of the best beginner belly dance DVD's I've owned.  Not only is Paulina clear and concise with her instruction, she shows the moves slowly, over and over so you can learn the moves properly.  I purchased this DVD because I just began belly dance classes taught by Paulina (here in SoCal) and wanted some one-on-one instruction, and this DVD does just that.  It also includes a belly dance workout and ends with performances by Paulina and another wonderful belly dancer.",1179792000,4,517,4.722222222222222
