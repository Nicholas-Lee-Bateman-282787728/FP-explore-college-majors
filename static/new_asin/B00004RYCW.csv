7921523,4,B00004RYCW,"If for nothing else, this is worth watching to see how schizophrenics really act. In most ways they appear to carry on with life normally, but ultimately their paranoia prevents them from holding a normal job or having social interaction to any degree. Jerry (Gibson's) chatter is seriously well acted.

Of course in this film the paranoia is (surprise!) justified. But the way Jerry secures his food and apartment from tampering is hysterical. The escape hatch from his apartment, and an escape from the hospital, chained to a bedrail, are masterpieces.

If you liked the book ""Catcher in the Rye"", you may enjoy this film too, although the book described a descent into mental illness, and the film describes escape from it; Hollywood wouldn't have it any other way.

The resonance of the film has changed since it was made a decade ago: Now the executive branch of government is strengthening its powers of surveillance, by its own admission. Whether you agree with that or not, it makes this film worth re-watching (and I seldom receommend re-watching any film).

Finally, if you love the films of Julia Roberts with her Mick Jagger lips, then of course you will like this film (for the others, in spite of her). There are some nice Mel Gibson action/chase scenes thrown in: the hot-dog-stand chase in particular turns out nicely comical.",1169856000,4,1342,4.898678414096916
