Season two's writing is even better than one's, with episodes 'New Arrivals', and 'Aunt Sally' being especially good. As with any series, some episodes are better than others, but I found ""Barriers"" very engaging, and ""A Private Place"" to be a very touching episode. As with the prior season, the stories approach from the human-interest perspective rather than procedural crime solving; those preferring interesting writing to hyper-emotional violence will find this second series very enjoyable viewing and a nice addition to their DVD collections.

Rather than reinventing the wheel here, please refer to my review of Season One for my overall description of the series. Again, note these disks require a region-free DVD player, capable of converting PAL to NTSC for US televisions.",1305072000,,935,5.3108108108108105
