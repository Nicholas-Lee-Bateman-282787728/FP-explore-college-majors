8314432,3,B000VB3PNC,"We ordered this DVD for our 6 year (& 2mo) old to give him some exposure to his Indian heritage. He is born and brought up in California and English is the only language he knows.
This DVD contains three short stories illustrated via 2D animation, with the total run time of about 20 mins. As the title suggests, the stories are from Indian mythology. It has English or Hindi audio stream options.
Pros:
=====
- Our son enjoyed the DVD and has asked for reruns - possibly because he was keen on following the stories and he showed interest in the culture. The rookie animation job was more of an amusement to him.

Cons:
