8649136,3,B00J9W0DOI,"The basic concept of this movie is the same as the 1934 version, but the plot is different with the widow being an actress instead of an aspiring businesswoman. In short, this movie is watchable and fairly well done, but every aspect of the 1934 version is superior. Watch both versions to compare approaches to making a film from a novel, or only watch the better version.",1480291200,,373,4.582089552238806
