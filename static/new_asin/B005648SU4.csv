8459183,4,B005648SU4,"The DVD is naught but Pictures at an Exhibition, but it is a nice one nevertheless. Lovro is not ANYTHING like his brother Ivo as a pianist, and Ivo has said as much publicly.
  The playing is clear, the video direction is informative, and one can get a real sense of what it takes to make this piece happen.
  Most people who might buy this item are probably pianists themselves, who wish to learn of the piece by watching as well as listening. It works very well for this purpose.
  Lovro's playing is not eccentric or really compelling, for that matter, either. He is simply performing the music here, and there is a lot to be said for pianists who let the music come first, and take a back seat to the presentation of the composer's ideas.
  The setting is a simple television studio, not some 17th century drawing room, or a big theater.
Enjoy,
