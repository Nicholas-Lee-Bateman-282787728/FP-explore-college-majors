7908732,4,B00000FYWA,"This is a great western!!I loved it from the first time I saw it, so I was happy to see it had been re-mastered and was willing to pay a premium for it. If this DVD has been remastered I can't tell it, I see absolutely no difference in the a2zcds version and the older, MUCH CHEAPER, version also available from Amazon. Don't bother wasting your money on this supposed re-mastered version, but by all means see this movie, its wonderful, a good script, good sound track and more money for production. It is truly sad when you realize that in a few short days Buck Jones was gone.",1247356800,,579,4.321100917431193
7908733,5,B00000FYWA,"First off, the title of this wonderful movie is Dawn ON the Great Divide. Check the titles. It's weird that so many get this wrong - even on the DVD cover. Of all movies to not care about, this is not the one.

The opening scene is the best wagon train scene ever. It's not rip-snortin', but you get a feel for what a trip by wagon train must have been like. Mona Barry's rendition of Rock of Ages, the reason for it, and her self comment after will break your heart. I've watched it at least 5 times in the past few years and I still cry, but then, I'm getting to be an old sucky baby anyway. Great stuff Mona, wherever you are. Favorite line: ""You Easterners sure are slick with the brain power"". Favorite character: Lil' Shaver. There's lots of action for any western fan. This is probably Buck Jones' best job. It's a real tragedy he had to die from the Coconut Grove fire after making this movie.

I already have 2 copies of this one, both in collections. I love it so much, I had to get this cleaned up version. I felt I owed it to whatever western gods there be. Or something.

7908734,5,B00000FYWA,"This is an exciting western about a smart sherrif finding a way to outsmart a bunch of wagon train rustlers. It's one of the classics and I've caught it several times on TBS and always liked it so I decided to buy my own copy. Surprisingly the DVD I got is of much higher film quality than the versions that I've seen on television, so this was my best experience of the film ever. I always laugh when the bad guy finally falls into the trap that has been set for him. The robbery scenes are very exciting.",1154044800,3,506,4.173469387755102
7908735,5,B00000FYWA,"""I bought this DVD as a gag - but it turned out to be one of the best Westerns I've ever seen. The hard-bitten frontier spirit comes across as totally genuine. Buck Jones is brilliant and brings his character to convincing life. `Dawn of the Great Divide' is pure and soul-stirring entertainment. """,1146528000,3,298,4.6415094339622645
