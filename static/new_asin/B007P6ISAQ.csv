5102603,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I started workout DVDs with Cindy Crawford in the 90s and have added to them throughout the years with everything from Tae Bo to Denise Austin to Windsor Pilates. I want to recommend Dream Body to anyone looking for a tough workout that's fun and new. Darby, the instructor of the video and owner of Fusion Fitness in Overland Park KS is high energy, inspiring, and just like she is in the actual classes at Fusion. (I've been a member for 2 years and also own the video for when I'm out of town or can't make it into the studio.) The moves are a mix of all types of exercises from yoga and pilates to good old-fashioned push-ups and crunches. The girls in the video are really working hard, and they are actually real instructors and clients at Fusion. This is a hard workout that will make you sweat and see results. (You can also modify moves if you're just starting out.) Check it out, you will NOT be disappointed!!!",1334534400,,921,4.391812865497076
5102604,5,B007P6ISAQ,"The Dream Body DVD is perfect for me! I travel for work and have two small children, so getting to class or to the gym for a hard core calorie burn isn't always an option.  Darby's Dream Body Workout let's me get in a REAL workout...allowing me to actually make changes to my body...in just an HOUR!  I always make room in my carry on for the Fusion DVD! Give this a try- the real clients in the background of the DVD are inspiring and Darby's energy is contagiuos!",1334534400,,465,4.213483146067416
5102605,5,B007P6ISAQ,This video is the hardest workout video I've ever done. It is the best total body workout possible. You will burn a ton of calories and sculpt muscles you didn't even know you had. All in an hour!!!! Awesome!!! Thank you Fusion Fitness!!!!,1334534400,,239,4.5813953488372094
5102606,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I highly recommend this workout.  I have tried a ton of workout DVDs & I've never found anything quite like this.  You don't have to be super coordinated to follow along...which is not always the case with other workouts.  I have attended Fusion classes for the past few years & I am literally sore after every class.  WIth every other type of workout I've tried I feel like I've ""peaked"" much sooner & stopped seeing results.  Not the case with Fusion....to be honest, I still can't complete a full class without having to modify something.

Darby is a great motivator & it's nice to see actual Fusion clients (real women, not fitness models etc.) in the DVD.

The bottom line is, this DVD will work.  You will see results.  My body has changed in so many ways.  I am stronger, more confident and leaner without any bulk.",1334534400,,822,4.530612244897959
5102607,5,B007P6ISAQ,"The Dream Body Workout is a great, upbeat workout.  I go to class every week and the video has the same energy that classes do.  The video is nice because it allows you to work on your form, as well as get a good workout.  IT enables you to get the same workout at home, and as a busy working mom it allows me to get a good workout early in the morning or late at night.

The workouts focus on all the muscles of the body, even the small muscles that you didn't know you had.  No matter how many times I workout with fusion fitness whether in a class or with the video I am sure to be sore.  I like that because then I know that I have gotten a good workout and I am headed in the right direction.  This is one of the best videos out there.",1334448000,,740,3.8289473684210527
5102608,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I have been working out at Fusion Fitness since my 3rd baby was 6 weeks old. NOTHING has changed by body and kept me this motivated as Fusion Fitness has. Darby put together a video that is just like being an an actual class. The energy is high, the music is great, and the workout is hard. I burn 600 calories in an hour when doing this! There are some fun pop-ups throughout the video that keep you entertained and informed about the move you are doing at that time. It's almost like watching a great music video at times. Darby is spot on every single move, giving you cues to make sure you are doing every move correctly. This will quickly become your favorite workout video!",1334102400,4,679,4.354330708661418
5102609,5,B007P6ISAQ,"If you like using workout DVDs, then Fusion Fitness Dream Body Workout is a must have for your workout DVD collection. Fusion Fitness is located in Overland Park, KS, near where I grew up. Every time I'm back visiting, my sister-in-law, Dani makes me go with her, and although I dread every minute of waking up, getting dressed, and driving there, I love it! It's a great workout for the entire body, mostly all the muscles you didn't know you had. I recently turned my friend Amy onto going there and she's addicted too. In fact she's the one who bought me the DVD. The DVD is kind of pricey for a workout video at $29.99, but it's worth every penny. The classes are $13 a piece, so use the DVD 3 times and it's more than paid for itself.

The DVD itself is very easy to follow. I'm awful at aerobics, seriously awful, and I can follow this just fine. Darby Brender, the creator of Fusion Fitness, and instructor in the video gives a good description of the exercise while showing perfect form. Also after seeing her do the exercise a few times in the class setting, the DVD goes to a shot of just her doing it so you can see how the exercise is done without any distractions. They guarantee that their unique technique will give you a beautiful sexy sculpted body.  Darby says, ""We have developed a system that will transform your body by elongating your muscles, decreasing body fat, improving cardiovascular endurance as well as increase flexibility."" I promise you will feel every minute of it during and after the workout!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fusion-Fitness-Dream-Body-Workout/dp/B007P6ISAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fusion Fitness Dream Body Workout</a>",1334016000,8,1716,5.060070671378092
5102610,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I'm a distance runner.  I do at least 70 minutes of intense cardio 7 days a week.  I've done Insanity and P90X (which I found to be boring and slow).  This work out kicked my butt.  I was dripping sweat within five minutes.  This is a full body workout.  It's challenging.  Your muscles will shake.  Even the smallest movements took a Herculean effort to complete.  I loved every second of this workout.

This is definitely not a workout for novices or beginners.  The work begins immediately with tough full body moves.  There is no transition time between reps and positions nor is there an explanation or set up for each maneuver.  It kept me engaged and on my toes (literally).  I struggled through this workout and am anxious to get to the same level of endurance as the women in the video.  Sure, the pop ups are obnoxious and the instructor is too perky but given how hard core the workout, I will power through.",1355184000,6,919,4.484848484848484
5102611,5,B007P6ISAQ,This workout is awesome!!!! It is hard. I thought I was in shape but I was wrong. I have to take frequent breaks and it is me new goal to make it through this workout.  I normally do p57 and booty bar with some Amy Dixon for cardio sometimes. This workout has me breathing hard and sweating buckets. If you want a new challenge try this if you're looking for something easy skip this one it's brutal (in a good way).,1353715200,,416,4.135802469135802
5102612,5,B007P6ISAQ,I rarely write reviews... but this workout is worth the expense. It is so challenging that you have something to work towards for weeks and months.... I am in good shape and I work out daily and I am incredibly challenged by this. It is one of my favorite videos by far!!!!,1351036800,,273,4.269230769230769
5102613,4,B007P6ISAQ,"I just got done doing this for the first time, and liked it overall.  It's different from the other barre/fusion workouts I have (I have P57, Pop Physique, Core Fusion, Squeeze, Ballet Body, and Ballet Beautiful, amongst others), and I love how it doubles as a cardio workout since the moves have you sweating.  It reminds me most of Pop Physique and Squeeze, but is different enough to warrant purchase.

To do the workout, you'll need a set of 1- or 2-pound dumbbells, a mat, and a stability ball.

The workout uses mostly small pulsing moves with the weights, mixed in with lots of plank and push-up variations, which I loved.  Darby also really targets the triceps a lot, which is nice for those of us over 40 who are fighting the bat wings. She uses the stability ball in the last part of the workout to work the legs, and does so in some unique ways.

This would be a five-star workout for me if it weren't for these drawbacks:

* the constant pop-ups made it hard for me to both see and hear Darby's cueing; at several times during the workout, I hadn't even realized that she had gone on to a new move since the person was still talking; these were extremely annoying, and I can only imagine that they'll be even more so as I do the workout more (I need to see if they get turned off if you go for the ""music off"" option)

* the ""Bubble Girl"" that pops in and out (Darby dressed in various costumes) was useful to see form, but she was often doing the moves differently than Darby's lead in the actual workout -- and her facial expressions looked like a scary Barbie doll; I appreciate that they were going for something different, but having a ""normal-looking"" Darby instead would have been a whole lot better

* the workout also comes in at about 65 minutes long, and the final stretch is only done on one side, before the screen fades out

Overall, I can see that doing this workout on a regular basis will definitely yield results, but I just wish that it didn't have these annoying features.

UPDATE ON 12/31/12:  Fusion Fitness just released a five-DVD set that is fantastic!  All of the bothersome aspects of the first Dream Body DVD (like the pop-ups, frantic pacing, etc.) are gone, and the new set is a lot of fun!  Once Amazon starts carrying it, I will post a review of it, but, in the meantime, I'd definitely look into ordering it if you liked this first DVD, but had trouble with some of its formatting.",1347753600,4,2426,4.39821029082774
5102614,5,B007P6ISAQ,"This is the hardest by far of all the dvd workouts I have done, but so much fun!  All I wanna do is fusion workout, everyday.",1342051200,,125,3.8076923076923075
5102615,4,B007P6ISAQ,"I bought this DVD a few months ago based on the many glowing reviews, and it (mostly) did not disappoint. I say mostly because the instructor is pretty annoying....non stop talk, but the workout itself is so challenging I just tune her out. I have yet to finish without having to pause several times. I am an avid advanced exerciser and find myself sweating like I did a straight hour of cardio. It is a great high intensity- low impact workout. I highly recommend it.",1341964800,,468,4.517647058823529
5102616,5,B007P6ISAQ,"If you want a workout that works your entire body and blasts fat, then this is a great workout.  A unique workout.  I especially like that the instruction gives me the sense of being ""in her class"" since I do this at home.  I'm dripping with sweat when I'm done...and TIRED.  I workout 5-6 days/wk and this workout never ever seems easy (only do this one 2-3x/wk).  A killer inner thigh and arm workout.  But seriously, if you do this regularly you will be in great shape.  For beginners...just do what you can...it's a tough workout!",1341705600,,534,4.5
5102617,2,B007P6ISAQ,"This DVD is as close to a live class feel as you can get at home.  A lot of people will appreciate that, but I did not.  My main issue is that it moves too quickly through the exercises, with little setup and instruction on proper form.  It is difficult to hear and understand the instructor a lot of the time (but I give her props for doing most of the workout along with the class).  In fact she is actually shouting instruction and encouragement over the music and you still cannot understand her at times.  I did like the music, it was much better than most DVD workouts.  I found the workout itself disjointed.  It did not flow very well.  It felt hurried and frantic for one thing, and she talks a mile a minute, but my main complaint is that there was a lot of core work, throughout the workout, which I didn't like.  There is no warm up.  She starts of wham bam with a difficult exercise right out of the gate where you do mountain climbers and then move to a standing one legged balance move with weights.  Like most of the exercises on this DVD, I found that the class is performing the moves so quickly that the at-home exerciser feels compelled to keep up, which can definitely compromise form and cause injury. Many of the moves are compound exercises so the complexity is increased, and attention to form is very important.  Another issue that many may find annoying is little pop up infomercials during the workout of people in the class touting the benefits.  This could get old after a while.  There was a short segment on the DVD with lower body floorwork and planks that I did enjoy, unfortunately this was over quickly.  I have a lot of DVD workouts and this one really fell short of expectations.",1341619200,11,1717,4.406349206349207
5102618,2,B007P6ISAQ,"When I first came across this DVD, it piqued my interest.  It looked like a different, fun and effective Tracy Anderson-like workout (I really enjoy Tracy's style of workouts) and seemed to have a crowd of loyal fans singing its praises.  When I finally got it home and watched it, however, two things became apparent to me:

1. This is a very effective and challenging workout. And
2. It has a very high annoyance factor.  Too high for me, in fact.

The instructor has come up with some unique body sculpting mat moves utilizing nothing but your own resistance, a set of light weights and a stability ball.  The style seems to be a aerobic/tone blend, with low-impact cardio moves interspersed with toning moves.  Even the toning moves, however, are done at a super-fast pace (TOO fast for me...It seems like there is a whole bunch of flailing around at times and form is sacrificed to speed).  It appears to be an actual class that is being filmed, so there is the instructor and a large group of women all working out and sweating their faces off (no makeup or hair artists here!).
These exercises are definitely tough and will get you in shape.
And now for my MAIN two deal breakers as far as this program is concerned.  The first is the instructor.  Darby comes across as very likeable, but she NEVER.  SHUTS. UP. EVER.  No, I'm not exaggerating.  She yells constantly in a hoarse run-on cheerleading voice and NEVER takes a breath. Her voice is just as constant as the background music. I own a lot of workout DVDs.  There's chatty...and there's this woman.  Wo[...] It may work in a class setting, but it doesn't work on a DVD.
And then there's the pop-up testimonials (think VH1's ""Pop-Up Video"") that randomly pop up throughout the workout.  The music (and of course, the instructor) is muted and you get to hear the ""Fusionistas"" (Darby's students)talk about how hard/nice they find the workout and how you shouldn't give up.  This is a very nice idea...as an OPTION.  You should be able to SELECT the Pop-Up testimonial feature.  Trying to work out and having to keep sitting through these random cheerleading episodes is a serious turn-off for me.  There also is a Pop-Up bubble at the beginning of each exercise showing proper form.  It's done kinda strangely b/c this bubble pops up and starts floating around the screen...But this can actually be helpful since some of the students in the class do not have the best form.
Many women love this workout.  It is certainly effective and unique.  But it's just got a bit too much going on for me.  I thought I'd try something a little different, but...No. As far as mat workouts are concerned, I prefer Tracy Anderson and Exhale Core Fusion.  (Tracy Anderson, though far from perfect, has a much more laid-back style [standing abs notwithstanding! :-)], slower, cleaner form and does not talk unnecessarily.  Much of the time, it is just you, her, the music and the exercises...Which is all I need!!)",1341446400,48,2960,4.699029126213592
5102619,5,B007P6ISAQ,This workout will completely change your body. Perfect for someone who wants to improve their shape versus just simply losing weight.,1339200000,,133,5.380952380952381
5102620,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I consider myself a fit person. I workout 6-7 days a week, at least 1 hr each session. I lift heavy, run hard & far, & do INTENSE bouts of interval training & this pushed me...HARD!  I have to say I have NEVER had to stop & rest or just stop completely & this DVD did it!  From the minute it starts you are going right up until the very end!  I tried to use 5 lb weights & NO WAY!!!  Had to drop them almost immediately. I used no weights & still got a GREAT workout!  The stability ball work towards the end is KILLER...VERY difficult & I could not keep up (but I was grateful to be lying down!!).  THIS IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!!!  If you are looking for something outside the norm this is it... FOR SURE going to shock my system!",1338940800,,730,3.9931034482758623
5102621,5,B007P6ISAQ,"For me this is by far the most effective and challenging workout that works the entire body and gives you a cardio workout in ONE HOUR!  This workout is H-A-R-D.  So if you are beginning, just do what you can.  It isn't suppose to be a breeze.  I think this workout gives an exceptional workout for arms and inner thighs while working the core/abs.  A very unique workout that won't leave you bored.  If you make it through the entire hour, you'll be glad you did it!  A great low-impact workout, too, for those like me who can't do high-impact moves anymore.",1338940800,,559,4.421568627450981
5102622,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I've bought A LOT of workout DVD's, this is the first DVD I have ever written a review for. This work out is hard, really hard.  It's an hour long DVD and there are no breaks, your muscles are screaming at the end of it, but if you're looking for a workout that is going to make a difference in your body, I personally think this one would be the one to get.",1338768000,,358,3.904109589041096
5102623,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I feeled compelled to write this review just out of fairness to balance out the harsh negative reviews from many who never even tried this excellent workout DVD suspecting the reviews were fake because of all the enthusiasm expressed I guess. For those who were influenced by such unfounded concerns, I purchased mine from Amazon (not realizing it was a DVD-R and I don't seem to notice a difference now that I know) after looking at a preview on Totalfitnessdvds.com and have reviewed many items including workout DVDs, and some also very enthusiastically as well. As a fitness buff with a large workout DVD collection, I get very excited when I find something new that provides variety and is very challenging for me at my level. It is an advanced workout with a lot of cardio and familiar barre type exercises woven throughout it. I love how it incorporates the stability ball for core in the way that Cathe Friedrich does, and that it never stops or slows down till the delicious stretch at the end. I highly recommend this for someone who wants to add more cardio to their barre toning and is a fan of Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre workouts. Not for beginners.",1338422400,5,1164,4.682926829268292
5102624,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I originally reviewed this and I decided to delete it and write a new one!  I LOVE this dvd now, I do it 3 times a week.  Originally I found the Pop up's etc annoying but now I don't notice them, and Darby used to annoy me because she talks so fast but now I just love her and find her motivating!  So ......... I felt it was only fair that I come back and re-review.  Please give this a go but a fair go I think the reason everything is noticeable at the start is because the wrokout is so god damn hard, but in a good way.  Once you get with the flow and it becomes easier all the little things that were so noticeable just don't matter anymore.  Anyway I can't wait till she brings out more.  So sorry DARBY for the harsh earlier review.  I give it 10 stars!",1338336000,3,761,3.9281045751633985
5102625,1,B007P6ISAQ,"I bought this as a lot of my online workout friends had too. I mainly do barre workouts (Tracey Mallett, Bar Method, Phyisque 57).  my main goal when working out is to stay toned. I don't need to lose weight so I choose things that don't have as much cardio in them. If you love a lot of intense cardio and working up a sweat then you will probably love this. For me i found my neck ached pretty bad after, probably from so many mountain climber reps. Its just personal choice. My legs tend to bloat too with too much much cardio and i like them slim and lean like how barre workouts keep them. Its not a bad workout if you like high intense workouts but i really have to be into it to keep up the workout and I just wasn't with this. The bubbles were annoying..maybe ok for your first workout but gets old after and she goes on and on and on.",1338163200,16,843,4.047904191616767
5102626,5,B007P6ISAQ,"Those who have posted suspected reviews need to chill and look at the workout on the totalfitnessdvds website.  And this is coming from a woman who throws around 31# and above kettlebell, me who did over 10K swings in January, I am here to tell you that this workout is hard, tough and a must need for women who need to tone up the hard to tone up places.  Using more than 3#s will humble you if you even attempt to try anything higher than that.  The fast pace, no-nonsense, getting down to it workout has a huge cardio effect and you will easily burn more than 500 calories when the hour is done.  If you do this workout at least twice a week, clean up your diet, incorporate other activities, you will see results.  It is core intensive, leg/thigh intensive, with rigorous arm workouts and all this done with your body weight and that says a lot.  Amazon has this video burned as a dvd, you can purchase from the totalfitnessdvds website and get a real pressed dvd.  I look forward to more of Darby's workouts and all the haters with their reviews, need to get this workout because it will truly humble you.",1337731200,10,1110,4.385365853658537
5102627,5,B007P6ISAQ,"Okay so I am a big fan of Tracy Anderson and Physique 57. This workout is like combining Tracy Anderson, Physique 57, and Jillian Michaels workouts.  I did this workout on a sprained ankle.  I wanted to try it so bad.  I did not workout to my full potential.  I am a seasoned exerciser who runs 4 miles and works out 5 to six days a week.  I could not do all the reps in this workout.  I had to modify alot because of my sprained ankle.  I was still sweating when the workout was done.  She starts and does not stop or take breaks the whole hour.  You are working your arms, stomach, legs, buns, everything at full speed ahead.

Ten minutes into the workout I thought 30 minutes had passed.  I would recommend doing this workout twice a week or every other day. It's an excellent video to add to your workout rotation.  I am from Virginia Beach and I have never been to any of her studios.  Some of the reviews on amazon were wondering if some of the reviews were fake.  Definitely not.

If you love TA, Physique 57, The Bar Method try doing this workout.  It will definitely take some time for me to build up to doing the reps.  I hope she records more videos.  Again this is for anyone.  I modified most of the moves but when my ankle gets better I hope to do this with all of my energy.  If you don't get fit and toned doing this daily then your eating way too much junk.

I would give this ten stars if I could.  It is worth paying the $30.00.

Do yourself a favor-and buy the video already!!!!!",1337212800,3,1499,4.128472222222222
5102628,4,B007P6ISAQ,"I did not believe any of the previous reviews mentioned because it's easy to tell the same person(s) wrote them.  I am not from this club, so in truth, it's a decent workout.  It is edited (towels, water bottles, weights, ball are in different places from one section to another) to push the viewer to her max.  I take small stretching breaks to balance out the intensity.  What I don't like about it is the instructor's voice, and when she says, ""10 more"" she really means 15, ""4 more"" really means 8.  If you have enough sense to do your own thing, you will find it worthwhile.",1336348800,6,579,4.373831775700935
5102629,5,B007P6ISAQ,"This workout, as others have said, is no joke.  No real warm-up, just straight into mountain climbers, interspersed with warrior 3 on the same side for many, many reps.  So right away you are feeling the burn.  It is mostly toning exercises with a few cardio exercises throughout but the cardio effect is HIGH.  A lot of work for the triceps, core and inner thighs, which I love.  The inner thigh work incorporating the stability ball is WICKED, and I love it.
Ok, the pop-ups and testimonials- was not crazy about these at first, the testimonials in particular.  I actually think the pop-ups are cute.  But I've used this workout probably five times now and I don't notice the testimonials so much now.  But it may bother some.  She also talks a lot and very fast, but I don't mind it.
And no, I didn't buy this from amazon.  I bought it from a fitness dvd website with a great return policy, just in case ;).  And I have used it repeatedly and I am very satisfied!",1336176000,12,966,4.401129943502825
5102630,5,B007P6ISAQ,"Ok, so I actually purchased this DVD online after I previewed it on another website.  I was a bit sceptical because after viewing the preview several times, I thought the instructor ""Darby"" was going to be annoying (well her voice actually) and it looked very easy.  Looks are decieving.  This routine is challenging and Darby's voice is not too annoying.  The format is fun with the bubble girl pop ups.  I wanted a change and I also wanted something different.  I received my DVD last week and let me tell you this DVD is no joke.  It is almost like a barre routine type workouts on steroids.  You do a lot of plank type combo exercises and you use you body weight.  The section where you use the Swiss ball for you abs and legs is creative and hard at the same time, so that this week when I did ball section of this routine, I used my barre3 ball which made it easier for me.  I love the fact that they are usings actual clients in the DVD and everyone is working at their own pace which makes you feel like you are in an actual class yourself.  Let me tell you this DVD is no joke.  I am going to add it to my workout rotation and I believe I will see results.

I just hope the fusion fitness kc makes some more DVDs.  Darby rocks!!!  So there is no reason to be sceptical.  I think the individuals who previously posted the amazon reviews are actuals clients who gave these rave reviews which now I can understand why -  wish I live in Kansas City so I could take a live class.

This DVD is a total keeper.  So if you are sceptical, google fusion fitness kc and preview the DVD before you decide to purchase it.  I believe you won't regret you purchase.",1336089600,9,1659,4.189873417721519
5102631,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I purchased this DVD directly from Fusion Fitness a few months ago when it first became available and it was not offered on Amazon at that time.  I learned about it after taking classes at Fusion Fitness in the Kansas City area.  In KC, Fusion Fitness is commonly regarded as one of the hardest, if not the hardest and most unique classes and workout centers.  I wanted to send the DVD to a friend as a gift and I order from Amazon Prime all the time so I thought I would check to see if it is available from Amazon yet and was pleasantly surprised that it recently became available on Amazon...which is great.  However, I am surprised by some of the suspicious ""reviews"" from people who have never seen the DVD or taken a class.  I personally believe that some of the positive reviews are from people like me who have purchased the DVD from the fitness company directly or other sites.  There is a very good preview of the workout on the Fusion Fitness website.  It is by far my favorite workout DVD and I own dozens.  I find most workout DVDs slow and simplistic and this is motivating and challenging while also being stylish, upbeat and fun to watch.  While I have been to the actual classes in person, I have absolutely no affiliation or relationship with the fitness center other than being an occasional client.  And for those of you wanting to read my other reviews as verification of something, I have never reviewed anything else but since I feel that there is unwarranted suspicion here, I wanted to give a first hand endorsement for Fusion Fitness and the workout on the DVD as a very fun, challenging and unique workout.",1336003200,,1633,4.505084745762712
5102632,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I received my copy yesterday and decided to give it a try. This workout is insane! I mean from the moment the workout starts, you do not stop for the entire hour! There is no warm-up, you just start with mountain climbers and it goes at a fast pace the whole time. Just 10 minutes into the workout I was sweating and breathing hard. I had to stop several times and I couldn't do all the reps. The women in the video keep telling you to stick with it and just keep doing the workout. They all look amazing, so that was motivating me to keep going.
The instructor talks really fast. That surprised me at first, but I tuned it out and focused more on the workout. It is a serious workout! I have so many different types of exercise videos and I'm always getting bored and looking for something new to challenge me. This is definitely challenging! The only weights they used were 1 pound. I guess because of the high reps. None of the women looked bulky either. They all had that dancer looking physique.",1335916800,5,1000,4.324468085106383
5102633,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I see some have questioned the authenticity of some of the reviews. Maybe I can help.  I have never heard of this woman or her fitness club. I am an at-home-workout person and own many DVD's because I get bored and always need to change it up.  I am always looking on Amazon for suggestions and while doing so, I stumbled upon this DVD.  I looked on youtube for a preview, liked what I saw and took a chance.  I love this workout, really love it!! It is hard and I had to stop a couple of times.  I feel like I get a complete workout, cardio and toning.  It is easy to return to Amazon, if you don't like it, return it.",1335830400,2,619,3.991869918699187
5102634,1,B007P6ISAQ,"I want to start by saying that i have no idea what kind of workout this is, other than a review on video fitness forums.
The reviews are fishy. If you look under the review, there will be something that says ""amazon verified purchase"" meaning they bought it from here. Not one of the reviews had that which makes me nervous to trust these reviews.
Again i don't have any idea how the workout is, just trying to help others.",1335830400,6,423,4.3
5102635,5,B007P6ISAQ,"Like i have mentioned in my previous reviews i do all workouts by Jillian,Bob, Michelle Dozois,Jessica Smith, and Jackie Warner. I have an eclectic arrange of workout DVDs. When i stumbled upon this at totalfitnessdvds.com i was intrigued but hesitate about the price. I am an advanced workout girl and let me tell you this was DIFFICULT, more so because you are concentrates on the minor muscles like the inner and outer thighs, triceps, and abs all at the same time. It is also difficult because instead of doing a regular squat pulse, your doing so on your toes so your now engaging even more muscles. There is also a move where you lift you leg back in the air and work your glutes and hamstring then sprawl out into a cross body push-up. INTENSE. I also love the segment with the stability it really engaged your leg muscles. I remember working my inner thighs and thinking why is this burning so much? This is a workout you will defiantly have to work on. Something that was also appealing was the diversity of ages and classroom atmosphere. I am a young adult so being able to do a workout with some people my age was even more inspiring and motivating ! I reccomond this workout for someone who wants to really tone up, but still sweat and burn calories. This is defiantley going to become apart of my daily routine",1335571200,5,1323,4.516666666666667

Every reviewer has such great things to say I wanted to see what their other reviews were like.  Not one had any other review other than this DVD.  This just doesn't seem right.  I guess I won't be ordering this DVD until I see some real reviews.,1335225600,28,344,4.074626865671642

I have been doing the boot camp style & pilates classes for 4 years, and I still can't quite get through this home video work out without taking breaks.  You need minimal supplies, a couple small weights, a yoga mat, and a big ball make it better.  Awesome supplement for those days you can't get to the gym.  Do this twice a week and you will see results.  It is hard, but rewarding.  If you are a fitness junkie, or you just want to take it up a notch and shed a few pounds and tone muscle you will love this DVD.",1334707200,,553,3.981818181818182

5102643,5,B007P6ISAQ,"This workout DVD is AMAZING!  Having a full-time career and also being a mother of two small children, this is exactly the challenging and hip workout I need, and in just an hour.  When I look at purchasing home workout DVDs, I want something that's going to get me that total body workout without bulking...this is it!  P90X and Insanity are great, but Dream Body is better.

If you dedicate 1 hour of your day it will change your body, I promise! I have tried numerous workouts both in person and video and everything pales to the fusion philosophy.  I am very fortunate to work out with Darby and the other Instructors at her studio and this video is almost as good as being there live.  I am a runner and have run marathons and numerous half marathons and this video is more challenging than running 13.1 miles.  I work out on average 5-7 times per week and no matter how many times I work out with fusion fitness you will work muscles you don't even know you have and feel it the next day in a good way!  My husband who is in excellent shape even admitted there is no way he could make it thru the video without fatigue setting in.  I can't thank the Fusion Ladies enough for changing my work out methods and more importantly my body.",1334620800,2,1005,4.2356020942408374

The moves are like nothing I've have ever seen.  After doing it once I was hooked.  Literally after 3 weeks of doing the workout, I could see a difference in my arms and the definition as well as my stomach.  I honestly just felt stronger all over!  This video is a perfect way to get a kickstart on the swim suit season.  The best part of the whole video is that the women in it are actual clients at this studio.  They give you motivation throughout the workout to keep your energy up!  I would absolutely buy this video!!!!",1334620800,,703,4.464566929133858

Every move is designed to specifically work each area...and afterwards, you can feel that it hits every muscle group.  It also contains enough cardio to keep the sweat flowing and calories burning...big time!  I love that the video is incredibly challenging...even for the fittest of the fit, but newbees can pause it or go at their own pace at first.  Very fun and upbeat!  Must have on hand for days you can get out!  Love it.",1334620800,,546,4.577319587628866

I have definition in my arms and slender yet muscular legs as a result of doing this workout. Darby and the Fusionistas are motivating to watch and listen to throughout the DVD, with a fun ""bubble girl"" popping in and out of the screen to make sure you are doing the moves with correct form. The attitude is playful and empowering, I truly can't wait to do the workout again the minute I have finished, even though it was so challenging. What woman out there doesn't want to feel empowered and beautiful? Thanks Darby and the Fusionistas!!!!! I can't wait for the next DVD!!!!",1334620800,,761,4.482014388489208

Darby is adorable as ""bubble girl"" flying in and out in her eighties inspired gear.  I love the ""fusionistas""!!  I feel like they are cheering me on.  It makes me actually look forward to dragging out my mat and popping in this video.  Especially, since I can choose the ""music free"" version and listen to my fav playlist!

The Dream Body workout just has something special about it - it's become part of my routine and I actually enjoy it! It shows real students taking a real class from Darby, the instructor, and it's all in real time - so you know everyone you're watching is working just as hard as you are - and you can tell! No one is making it look easy--and it's not, but it WORKS! Darby focuses on your form and the workout is designed to hit all those tiny muscles that are really hard to hit. Instead of gaining bulk, I just feel like my muscles are getting tighter and longer. Even though it's a serious, hardcore workout, somehow it's also really fun!",1334534400,,768,4.340277777777778
5102659,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I absolutely love this DVD! Being a fusion fitness member for almost 3 years now, I could not say enough good things about the design and philosophy behind fusion. The DVD is an awesome way to squeeze in a workout when I can't make it to the studio, and also so nice to do in my living room when I don't feel like heading out! One of my best girlfriends lives in NYC and loves when she gets to come back home to kc and go to a fusion class. She has done and tried every fad workout in New York and she said to me last time she was here that ""New York seriously has nothing like this. Darby should consider sellng to Equinox!"" It's pretty awesome to say that KC has one of the best workout studios and now DVD across the country. This is totally worth getting, as Darby along with the REAL women exercising in the workout are so motivating! You will see results, as I have seen it change my body. Makes for a great gift too!",1334534400,,923,4.076923076923077
8520200,3,B007P6ISAQ,"This is an extremely difficult workout, especially if you're a guy using 8-10 lb weights.  Lots of pilates/barre stuff.  Fundamentally, it's very sound, but it has some big flaws.  The pace is too quick -- the instructor moves rapidly from one exercise to another without a demo, much less a break.  Seconds after the exercise is started, a bubble shows up with a demonstration of the move, but by then you're already in the middle of the set.  The viewer also doesn't have an idea what the expectation is per exercise --  how much time should be spent or target number of reps until what seems to be some random time when Darby starts doing a countdown from 8.  Finally, the video is peppered with pop-up testimonials from various exercisers in the class that seem to show up at random.  I guess they're there to be motivating, but they are often more distracting.  Given these issues and the choppy editing, at times I felt like I was on the sidelines just watching a class, rather than participating in an exercise video.",1428969600,,1024,4.613259668508287
8520201,1,B007P6ISAQ,"This was one of the worst workouts I have ever purchased. The bubble floating while the workout is on is very annoying, and I would not recommend this to anyone. Plus, the camera during the workout moves way too much on the people during the workout. It is very low quality, and just does not flow right at all. Waste of time and money.",1394841600,4,336,4.265625
8520202,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I do a lot of barre and boot camp infused workouts. This literally is non-stop. Planks, downward dog arm work, light weights, some plyometrics are a few of the variations in this workout. The balancing exercises are tough. I really felt my standing leg.

I had to modify for the ab work. One of the exercises required a large physio ball between the legs. I had to drop the ball or perhaps use a smaller playground ball towards the end. The abs with the hovering leg with triceps over head, I had to put my leg on the floor because the sets are long and then you proceed to the next exercise with no stretches until the end.
Watch the video once, learn the form so you don't hurt yourself or compensate and use the wrong muscles. I will do this workout tomorrow so I can nail the transitions. There is a lot of great feedback about Dream Body. It will shock your body!

Note: everyone says the instructor is annoying but she motors you through the workout. Just put on music to drown her out if you must.",1390348800,,1004,4.306878306878307

8520204,5,B007P6ISAQ,"let me start out by saying, yes this girl can talk and she doesnt stop! however I am basing this review on the workout alone. I do not typically do a ton of pilates because I want to burn a ton of calories. This workout will keep your heart rate elevated while toning at the same time. I am really in shape and I cant get through it, so it gives me something to work towards. It is really tough and challanging!",1381363200,,411,4.024390243902439

Yeah, there are some annoying things about the video; the pop-up talkers are super annoying and Darby talks non-stop.  However, these things are far from annoying enough to make me not want to keep doing this workout.  I loved it so much, I just ordered the series!",1366070400,,447,4.481481481481482

After viewing some clips I decided that it looked like a good workout.  In my opinion this is an intense cardio workout and  should be purchased if you're looking for something that will leave you sweating profusely. I was only able to complete the first ten minutes the first three days. I'm hoping that little by little I will be able to complete the entire workout. For anyone who has doubts about the intensity and/or appropriateness of this workout the best I can recommend is to find clips of this DVD on the web. After all, not everyone is at the same fitness level and everyone has different needs.",1360540800,7,762,4.474820143884892
8520207,5,B007P6ISAQ,"I am by no means a weakling when it comes to working out (I've done everything from pilates to step to boot camp to barre to running the LA Marathon), but this workout will SERIOUSLY humble you. I had to take many, many breaks when I first started this DVD - actually, come to think of it, I couldn't even make it the whole way through it the first time - and now I feel like it's a job well done when I can do the majority of the movements. If you're looking for something to shake you up a little bit, or even give you a good a** kicking, this is definitely something you need in your repertoire. You'll also be hooked once you see your thighs slimming down after doing it just 2-3 times. I initially thought I could incorporate this one 2-3 times a week, but realistically, this is something I can handle only once a week.",1359849600,7,825,4.1625
8520208,5,B007P6ISAQ,"This is one of those workout videos I avoided for the longest time because of the cover. It looks ""dumb"". And then the comments talk about the ""bubble girl"". Okay. Totally not my style. I finally picked it up, and holy cow.......what a workout! I had a hard time keeping up, broke a sweat in the freezing basement, and was sore for two days afterwards. This is going in the regular weekly workout rotation!

I don't mind the bubble girl, who shows you proper form. This is a high intensity workout, and proper form is important, especially if you have injuries as I do. I don't like the Fusionista's talking about how great the workout is- I can tell how great it it - I couldn't do the whole thing the first two times through it. That said, I liked this workout enough to buy Fusion's new 5 disk set that they just started selling. It's even harder than this, but minus the annoyance factors.

This is a butt kicking, fat-burning workout, that is not for the faint of heart, or out of shape. It moves very quickly, and some of the moves are tricky at first. It takes some time to master them. I like that in 1 hour, it manages to hit every muscle group - hard. So, if you're on the fence, and put off by the dumb-looking cover, look past it. This is a serious workout!",1358553600,5,1269,4.283333333333333
8520209,3,B007P6ISAQ,I like this workout because it will cause you sweat! I still can't complete the entire workout without stopping and taking a quick break. I give it 3 stars because the instructor talks a little too much for me and the pop-ups can get annoying.,1356998400,,243,4.4222222222222225
