7866216,5,6304258704,"With the vast majority of silent films no longer extant, it's amazing and fortunate for Oz fans that these films survived.  Three films were produced by L. Frank Baum himself, based on his books, just prior to World War I.  The sets and costumes are highly imaginative, as you would expect from Mr. Baum.  The fourth is the 1925 version of ""The Wizard of Oz"", most notible for having Oliver Hardy in the cast (The Tin Woodman) and for proving that MGM's ""Oz"" was not the first filmed version of Dorothy's journey to Oz (although neither was this one).  It is not faithful to the book, and, although a spectacle in the twenties, it has a tendancy to bore today.  These films look as good as you might expect from films which are nearly 90 years old (except the last, which is nearly 80 and still looks good), but the soundtrack--silly, annoying music and bland, lifeless readings of the title cards--just don't cut it.  I prefer to put on my own music when watching these rare silents.  I find anything from The Ultra-Lounge CD collection works well.  As I mentioned in my first sentence, these films are for Oz fans and will not appeal to most movie-goers, although very young children may get a kick out of these.",1039132800,,1214,4.536697247706422
7866217,5,6304258704,"Like the Oz series, these silent films are ingenious. The acting is grossly dramatic, as in most silent films. The costumes of the fantasy characters are great fun. My six-year old daughter was especially taken with ""The Magic Cloak."" For those children unable to read, most (though not all) of the occasional written frames are narrated. We highly recommend these videos - pure magic and many great role models for girls. Suggestion: read the books first. While the films stand alone, children enjoy seeing familiar friends brought to life.",991353600,,541,5.089887640449438
