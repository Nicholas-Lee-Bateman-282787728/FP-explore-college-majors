8633195,5,B00HK5GCO6,"I remember taking my older son to see This movie in a Theater in West Los angeles, I am taking about years ago.
This time with a glass of wine in his home we enjoy this movie again. I have no complaints about your service, or the quality of the sound or anything else with the DVD . It is a good story and the actors are great ,ironically, now I got a chance to see the big picture, probably need it more money. It was good not only to see it again with my son, I will  share this movie with family members, I have a big family.
Thank you for your service in making this possible.",1425513600,2,580,3.9152542372881354
8633196,2,B00HK5GCO6,I'd give it four stars but for one thing: no English subtitles.,1424304000,,63,4.333333333333333
8633197,2,B00HK5GCO6,"I own this version of the film as well as this one: <http://www.amazon.com/Cabeza-Vaca-Juan-Diego/dp/B00005JXYF/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1421433822&sr=8-6&keywords=cabeza+de+vaca>. Unlike one of the other commentators, I bought this version specifically because it doesn't have sub-titles burned into the film (I hate it when subtitles are burned into the film rather than an option)

First the good. There is an additional scene in this version after CdV leaves the hechicero and mala cosa but before the fire scene. In the additional scene, CdV hallucinates his past and the events of his adventure. It's a great scene. I wish it were in the other.

The bad. The video quality is terrible. It's very dark compared to the other version with no contrast. Some scenes are so dark that you can't distinguish among the characters even on a high def monitor.

The sound quality is also terrible. Further, the audio track of this DVD contains the audio recorded at the same time (apparently) as the filming, and some of the actors have such strong Mexican accents that it completely destroys the film. The other version linked above has been dubbed with MUCH MUCH cleaner audio and with castillian speakers so the accents are correct.",1421366400,9,1227,5.282051282051282
8633198,1,B00HK5GCO6,"I saw a clip from this movie in another PBS segment and there were subtitles in English. There was no way of knowing this actual DVD contains NO English subtitles, or if there were, I was not able to turn them on. Why is it when you purchase a movie in English, there are always subtitles in Spanish, French, sometime German yet there are no English subtitles on a Spanish movie? I don't speak, nor read, Spanish. And even more annoying is limited words at the beginning of the movie had me all set to enjoy the subject matter. I guess for $10, it was a lesson hard learned. If anything, now I know perfectly well what the Spanish explorers experienced firsthand when they came in contact with the Native Americans and tried to communicate with one another, que no?",1421107200,10,765,4.4714285714285715
8633199,1,B00HK5GCO6,"Bad copy (transfer) No letterbox, which is nor specified on box.",1416355200,4,64,4.909090909090909
