8158002,5,B00009KNTY,"The Dead Zone is one of my favourite shows. I'm surprised that no one else has reviewed it before, although that may be because it can speak for itself. The Dead Zone is one of those rare occurances where the show is not only based on a book, it also follows the plot line of the novel rather than just stealing the characters. It's based on a Stephen King novel and ends up with an amazing mix of horror and humour to stop it from having an atmosphere that is too heavy all the time. The show itself is one of the most visually stunning I've ever seen. The cinematography pulls the viewer along and the special effects are used so skillfully that sometimes you don't even notice that they're there. The acting is really good and the show often tackles current and/or controversial topics, from school shootings, to politics, to witchcraft. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is interested in current events and the unusual or paranormal. Anyone who likes modern SciFi and continueing stories will love this.",1100908800,,1016,4.6187845303867405
