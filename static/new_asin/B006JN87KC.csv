ELIMINATION CHAMBER 2012
Spoilers

1.[WWE TITLE ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH]CM PUNK VS KOFI KINGSTON VS CHRIS JERICHO VS DOLPH ZIGGLER VS THE MIZ VS R TRUTH-the Raw Chamber match kicks things off for us which was a surprise for me. This is usually the main event on this PPV with the Smackdown Chamber match earlier in the night. Any way Punk and Kofi starts us out and do battle until Dolph enters, he usually steals the show. Since he usually does that I was excited to have him and Punk in the same match. Ziggler takes a lot of bumps on the steel during this match. Kofi of course shows of his athletic ability in this match going all over the Chamber. R-Truth enters next and lights up Ziggler as soon as he gets out. Next up is The Miz who really has a strong showing here in this match taking it to everyone. Jericho is the last to enter the match but is eliminated the craziest. When it came down to just two it was Punk and Miz, and they did a great job. This could very well be the best match on the card, and it started the event.

2.[DIVAS TITLE]BETH PHOENIX VS TAMINA SNUKA-first off I have to ask, why did the champion come out first? I hate that and it seems it only happens when the heel is champ. Any way this is not a bad match and I really like Beth so I enjoyed it. It was your average Divas match but not bad. Beth keeps the belt after the Glam Slam, also it was cool to see a Superfly fly again.

Here we have a brief little thing with John Laurinaitis coming out with Otunga announcing that he should be GM of Raw and Smackdown. He is then joined in the ring by Alberto Del Rio, Mark Henry, and Christian as they wanted to show their support for him.

3.[WORLD TITLE ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH]DANIEL BRYAN VS GREAT KHALI VS BIG SHOW VSSANTINO MARELLA VS WADE BARRETT VS CODY RHODES-now all night they were showing Santino training for this match since he was a big underdog but sentimental favorite. Show and Barrett kick things off here and gives a brawl until Cody enters the match. Show was waiting for him and punishes him in front of Bryan. Our hero Santino is released from  his pod next and is on fire until he also runs into Show. The same can be said for our next entrant as well, Khali. He is dominating until he runs into Big Show, except it is the other way around. That leaves the one man Show was really waiting for, Bryan. The only thing is he doesn't wait, Show breaks into the pod from the top and from there he puts it on Bryan. From there we get a good battle from everybody but the story here is the last two guys, Santino and Bryan. The crowd wanted Santino to win this so bad, they were really into Santino making it to the last two. Honestly they wanted it so bad it started to rub off on me even though I knew better. In the end the fairy tale ending was not to be, Bryan retains his title.

4.[US TITLE]JACK SWAGGER VS JUSTIN GABRIEL-this match was added at the event after a backstage segment, which why did they already have their gear on? Come on WWE you can at least make it look like it really was added that moment. Any way the match was pretty good and was good enough to pass some of the time for the PPV. Could have been much better had they been given more time.

[AMBULANCE MATCH]JOHN CENA VS KANE-this match was all about Kane trying to get Cena to ""embrace the hate"". To be honest I didn't hate this feud like some others have told me they did but it could have been so much better. In fact this would have been the perfect angle for Cena to become a heel if they were to ever do that. Any way this is a really entertaining match as these kinds always are. Even the casual fan will enjoy this match with all the brawling and weapons being used. The match is barely in the ring at all before they move to the outside and all up and down the aisle. When they do enter the ring again it is still more of a brawl than a wrestling match. Of course for this type of match it should be more of a fight than anything else. Even though this feud ending up going nowhere really this was still a good match with Cena coming out on top of course.

Over all this was a pretty good event with some good matches with none bad in my opinion. Both Chamber matches were good with the Raw one being the best of the two and of the night. There were many highlight reel moment throughout the night. Not the best Chamber event ever but to be honest I think this event should be done away with. This and the ""Hell in the Cell"" events should go, those matches should be special matches saved for big time feuds every once in a while. Same can be said for the ""Money in the Bank"" event, I liked it better as a ""Wrestlemania thing. Still these matches always deliver memorable moments so what do I know. Also there is an interview with Bryan as a special feature here.",1352246400,5,4805,4.175836030204962
4994614,4,B006JN87KC,"RAW Elimination Chamber with WWE Champion CM Punk vs Kofi Kingston vs The Miz vs Dolph Ziggler vs R-Truth vs Chris Jericho: This is the first time in the PPV's history that Raw starts off the main, they usually get the main event spot. This match had non-stop action and Punk retained his belt. With WrestleMania coming up, I think this PPV doesnt make sense and makes the Rumble look weak.

Santino is shown training thru out the event. It's sad how WWE can place him into a main event considering how much talent is on the Smackdown roster.

Beth Phoenix VS Tamina: They might have wrestled a good match but since I don't watch women wrestling, I wouldn't know.

We got three comebacks-Del Rio, Mark Henry, and Christian do an interview in support for John Laur...however you spell it. I can't believe people actually waste money to buy this on PPV.

Smackdown Elimination Chamber with World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan vs Wade Barret vs Cody Rhodes vs The Big Show vs Santino Marella vs The Great Khali: As much as if i've been a Smackdown mark over the years, i'll admit the show is getting pretty damn stale. I was shocked this wasn't the main event, another first in the ppv's history. I wasn't really into the match because the action was slower then Raw's chamber match. I fast fowarded most of this. To sell the WrestleMania PPV, the unstoppable Sheamus attacks Bryan after the match. How did the match turn out again?

Hornswoggle segement with Natayla Neidhart and her farting gimmick, seriously? Then Justin Gabriel walks in and so does Jack Swagger. It sets up an added match to the PPV and another seed for a WrestleMania is planted as well.

US Champion Jack Swagger VS Justin Gabriel: Not a PPV quailty match, could have been seen on Raw, Smackdown, or even Superstars. What a waste of time and I'd be mad if I spent my money on this, only thing good so far was the opening match.

Rock VS Cena promo for WrestleMania.

Kane VS Cena in a Ambulance Match: I'm not the biggest Cena fan but his hardcore matches are usual good to watch. A good little brawl even though I think Kane expired years ago.

Overall, the opening match was the best. Cena-Kane was a good main event but since it's at the Elimination Chamber, it makes little sense. Amazon is selling this for the low, low price of $11.50. That isn't a bad price for a good, not great PPV.",1334966400,4,2366,4.535211267605634

4994616,3,B006JN87KC,"Elimination Chamber Match: WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. R-Truth vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Chris Jericho vs. The Miz vs. Dolph Ziggler - C.M. Punk was in for a long night here as he started the match & had to last the entire run in order to retain his championship. Various highlights including Dolph using the chamber to ""show off"", Kofi & Punk's midair collision, Kofi acting like Spider-Man before delivering a DDT to Dolph on the grate that knocked him out, Miz's moment of domination, Jericho using the environment around him, Kofi's ""Trouble In Paradise"" on the outside grate & later coming off the top of the pod, Punk & Jericho going at it to the point where it heavily effected the rest of the match, various false finishes, and the match up between the final two. This was really good as they told some good stories while everyone at one point or another took a hard hit on the outside while people like Miz & Kofi went out of their way to have standout performances here.

Divas Champion Beth Phoenix vs. Tamina Snuka - As reference to before the match, Beth had some plaid placed on the title belt in reference to Roddy Piper based the feud in the past with Piper & Tamina's father Jimmy Snuka. There was really nothing to say here except this match was decent at best with the only thing noteworthy being Beth working over Tamina's side throughout the bout. This match got a lot of praise from their peers via Twitter but I enjoyed the series Beth had with Kelly Kelly & Eve more than this which is a shame since Tamina is one of the divas who had heavy wrestling experience (compared to most of the other divas) before coming to WWE.

Right around here was a segment where Johnny Ace (again, I can't spell his last name if my life depended on it) & David Otunga came out with a ""huge announcement"" which turned out to be that he was announcing this intentions of not only being the permanent General Manager of RAW but also replace Teddy Long as the General Manager of SmackDown which led to the return of Alberto Del Rio & Christian along with Mark Henry coming down to show their support for Johnny & air their grievances against Teddy. This was one of those segments that could have been saved for TV but also I felt was a waste of long awaited returns.

Elimination Chamber Match: World Champion Daniel Bryan vs. Big Show vs. Santino Marella vs. Great Khali vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Wade Barrett - It should be noted that throughout the night, they kept showing these backstage segments where Santino was trying to channel the energy of Rocky Balboa knowing that he was going into this match as the underdog (I personally found them funny). This was a match, based off entertainment value alone, that was way better than expected going in with the fact that Khali was one of the participants (guess that's WWE's response to TNA's Ring Ka King project) but didn't effect the match at all while the story of Santino being the underdog really caught on to the point where the crowd was getting behind him here. While Bryan & Barrett & Rhodes also had good showings here including some hard hitting spots getting thrown into the pods but without a doubt the one moment to look out for here was Big Show getting his hands on Bryan to the point where he just beat the living hell out of him inside his pod.

United States Champion Jack Swagger vs. Justin Gabriel - This was a bonus match that wasn't anything special as the only noteworthy thing here was the backstage skit setting this up that had Hornswoggle naming his favorite types of cheese before seeing Vickie Guerrero who reminded him of another type of cheese.

Ambulance Match - For those who have never seen the three previous Ambulance Matches in history (two in WCW, one in WWE), the only way to win this match is to put your opponent in the back of the ambulance & close the door. With Kane winning the only other match of this type in WWE history (S. Series '03 vs. Shane McMahon), he was the heavy favorite here as both men started in the ring but shortly ended up brawling out of the ring down the isle towards the ambulance where some of the objects inside the vehicle was brought up & used as a weapon. They both fought back to ringside where Kane was able to pull a wheelchair from under the ring (seriously, who puts that under the ring?) before it was eventually used as a weapon. They continued to brawl through the crowd before going back to ringside where Cena ""embraced the hate"" & punished Kane with everything available at ringside including the microphone, monitor, steel steps, and the announce table. Despite the way this entire feud developed (I personally didn't care for the crappy soap opera acting or their previous PPV match at the Rumble), this was a good match & the highlight of this feud as Cena is better at brawling & using weapons while Kane has also had his best encounters in these ""no rules"" environments.

It should also be noted that somewhere throughout this PPV, we got another John Cena video package hyping up his WrestleMania match vs. The Rock while Sheamus made an appearance to declare which championship he would challenge for at WrestleMania. In the end, this PPV was a repeat of the Elimination Chamber two years ago where there was too much filler for my taste (Cena's video package, Johnny Ace's announcement) while the other matches that weren't the main events weren't another special (U.S. & Divas title matches). So I would only recommend this PPV if your a fan of the Elimination Chamber match (or Santino Marella) but past that, it's a stop on the Road To WrestleMania that you can pass.",1330560000,2,5606,4.551040634291377
4994617,2,B006JN87KC,"Considering how much hype there is for Wrestlemania 28, it was almost impossible to get fans to care about this Pay Per View. It's almost as if there shouldn't be any shows in between The Royal Rumble and Wrestlemania just so WWE can use that time to build up interest for their biggest shows.

Match 1: RAW Elimination Chamber. WWE Champion CM Punk vs Kofi Kingston vs The Miz vs Dolph Ziggler vs R-Truth vs Chris Jericho.

This should have been the main event for the show because nothing was going to top this. CM Punk and Kofi started started out with some great wrestling. Kofi was practically the star of this match with his acrobatic moves and channeling Spider-Man like Rob Van Dam and John Morrison have in past Chamber matches. There was great interaction among all the wrestlers, and the confrontation between Punk and Jericho was just a taste for their inevitable showdown in April. Action packed from start to finish, and the show went downhill from here.

Throughout the show, Santino Marella was doing Rocky-esque training for the Smackdown Chamber match. I know he has his fans who think he's funny, but Marella is too goofy for me. I wish someone like Justin Gabriel, Ted DiBiase, or Christian could have took the places of him and Khali.

Match 2: WWE Diva's Champion Beth Phoenix vs Tamina Snuka. They had a tough act to follow, but wrestled a pretty good match. Tamina gets better the more time she's given to wrestle, and Beth is just Beth, which is a good thing. It's disappointing that the crowd didn't care too much for this match, but there were a few other cheers which give me hope that women's wrestling still has legit fans.

We even get a talking segment with Johnny Ace that lasts way too long and wastes the returns of Alberto Del Rio, Mark Henry, and Christian. Did nothing for any storylines and made people wish they didn't pay for this.

Match 3: Smackdown Elimination Chamber. World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan vs Wade Barret vs Cody Rhodes vs The Big Show vs Santino Marella vs The Awful Khali.

So an Elimination Chamber match doesn't main event it's own PPV? Randy Orton was supposed to be in this match but suffered a concussion. Some decent action to be found. Bryan, Barret, Rhodes, and Show all took some nasty bumps. Even Santino showed some effort. Thankfully, Khali is taken out of the match early. I was pretty disappointed with Bryan still playing the cowardly heel instead of being the wrestling machine that he is. The crowd loved Santino and wanted him to win so badly. (!?) Bryan and Marella had a somewhat decent exchange, but It's really hard to take Marella seriously as a competitor after being portrayed as a joke for so long. He should be repackaged as a Colt Cabana type of character.

Match 4: United States Champion Jack Swagger vs. Justin Gabriel. A last minute match that barely lasted a moment and added nothing to the show. These guys deserve better. Next:

Match 5: Ambulance Match. John Cena vs. Kane. This debacle of a feud ends the show on a low note. It's the same slow lumbering brawl we got at the Royal Rumble, and even the spots that seemed like they'd get a good reaction from the crowd didn't. And of course, nothing in the storyline was resolved.

This is an easily skippable show and drastically dropped in quality since the last 2 Elimination Chamber PPVs. I'm glad WWE doesn't have as many PPVs as before, but they can still cut back on a few of them.",1330300800,4,3438,4.612111292962357
4994618,3,B006JN87KC,"I was disappointed with the Elimination Chamber last night because everything was predictable. The PPV began with the WWE Championship match inside the RAW Elimination Chamber ,which of course CM Punk won. I'd prefer if everyone get eliminated with either pinfall or submission instead of an injury. The way Chris Jericho was eliminated just upset me. However, the match itself wasn't that bad as all 6 men put up a good fight but didn't really satisfy me.

Beth Phoenix Vs Tamina Snuka for the Divas Championship was a decent match. Both women did their thing with some impressive moves but could've done much better because both women could actually wrestle. Beth picking up the victory makes sense because the WWE would want her to look strong going into her Wrestlemania match with Kharma, if they book it.

Johnny Ace coming out to give an speech on how he should have full control of both RAW and Smackdown was a waste of time. Something like this should be left for an episode of RAW and not a PPV. However, seeing Alberto Del Rio, Christian and Mark Henry return was pretty cool all these men look like their ready to return to the ring.

The World Heavyweight Championship match inside the Smackdown chamber was ok. The match was pretty slow throughout the entire time but ended very well. Santino and Daniel Bryan put up one hell of a match after being the last two men remaining in the chamber. A massive pop for Santino in that match, which was amazing to see. If Santino continues this momentum I wouldn't be surpise if he wins the World Title in the future.

Jack Swagger VS Justin Gabriel for the United States championship was not fun. I don't like it when WWE puts in last minute matches because there aren't any build up to it making the match meaningless. However, the match made Jack Swagger look strong in his first title defense.

John Cena Vs Kane in an Ambulance match was ok. Of course John Cena has to pick up the victory here to make him look strong for his match against the Rock at wrestlemania 28. Also, it's obvious the WWE won't turn John Cena heel or at least more edgier because of the kids and women that love him. Cena is to much of a cash cow as a babyface that Vince won't dare turn him heel. Anyways, I hope this feud ended last night because Cena completely buried Kane making their feud meaningless, if continued. Overall, I gave the PPV 4/10 since it didn't really live up to the hype.",1329696000,4,2427,4.531963470319635
4994619,5,B006JN87KC,"The Raw Elimination Chamber match started with nice chain wrestling with CM Punk & Kofi Kingston but then it turned into a High-flying,hard-hitting,smash-mouth,entertaining brawl and they also found new ways to use the chamber as a weapon like when Chris Jericho slamming the pod door on Punk's arm. The Divas title match between Beth Phoenix & Tamina Snuka was a good smash mouth bout. The Smackdown Elimination Chamber match was slow still a smash-mouth,hard-hitting brawl and things got really intense in the end when it came down to Daniel Bryan & Santino Marella(Subbing for Randy Orton). The United States title match between Jack Swagger & Justin Gabriel was short but pretty good. The Ambulance match between John Cena & Kane was a hardcore,ruthless,ECW-like brawl. I give this PPV a 9 out of 10.",1329609600,4,804,5.052631578947368
