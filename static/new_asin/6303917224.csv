But I'm more than content with this labor of love. Hat's off to all involved!

For one thing, George Pal had nothing to do with Gumby and Pokey (Art Clokey created Gumby in the early 50s), and for two, how can you complain about false advertising looking at the COVER alone? The description tells you exactly what you'll get. Moreover, George Pal made a wonderful series of ANIMATED SHORTS INCLUDED IN THIS BLU-RAY called the ""Puppetoons"" and that is the NAME OF THE BLU-RAY. So even the COVER tells you what you'll get. There is nothing false about the advertising; the trouble is an ignorant reviewer. Gumby and some other stop-animated classics appear and even star in the movie itself, but that is not the spirit of the movie nor the spirit of the extras. The point of the movie and extras is to extol George Pal, and in this, this Blu-Ray succeeds.",1398124800,,983,4.622857142857143

Basically you're getting everything from the old Image Entertainment 3 DVD boxed set ""George Pal: Flights of Fantasy,"" plus a whole lot more.  There's tons of new bonus material, including extended interview clips with the likes of Ray Harryhausen, Ray Bradbury, Jim Danforth, Wah Chang and Roy Disney (among others), giving additional insight into Pal's influence on shaping cinematic science fiction and fantasy.  (Sadly a few bits of the interviews show that the video source material has had some age issues, but fortunately these are minor.)

Like its earlier DVD counterpart, THE PUPPETOON MOVIE also includes bonus Puppetoon shorts...but the Blu-ray has even more than before.  (Just a slight correction to the listed contents:  A new group of bonus Puppetoons are listed as having never before been available on home video.  One of these ""previously unreleased"" shorts is THE SKY PRINCESS, which had already been included an an earlier animation compilation DVD called STOP-MOTION MARVELS, but the print used here is far superior.)  Curiously, WESTERN DAZE is conspicuous by its absence.  This 1941 short was Pal's first American-made Puppetoon, and marked Ray Harryhausen's first professional job as an animator for a Hollywood studio.

About the only thing that could have made this any better is if they could have arranged to use actress Terry Moore's commentary for THE GREAT RUPERT, which she recorded for the colorized version of the film released by Legend (which, for some reason, was released under the new title A CHRISTMAS WISH).",1395619200,,1793,5.28169014084507

Extended interviews with greats like Ray Harryhausen, Ray Bradbury, Gene Roddenberry, Walt Disney, Wah Chang, Duke Goldstone and Russ Tamblyn are also present. If all of that  and a commentary from Leibovit and animation authority Jerry Beck  wasn't enough, theres also Leibovits wonderful 1985 documentary The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal. Presented in standard-def, this loving production offers clips from all of Pals classics with fond remembrances from their respective cast members. I first watched the program on a local PBS station in the late 80s and it immediately generated my interest in tracking down all of Pals productions back in the heyday of VHS and laserdisc.

733209,5,6303917224,"(1) For those who appreciate stop frame animation this IS something to own. However, I wish the DVD company would have restored some of the puppetoon shorts. Different shorts are faded, and have certain flaws.

(2) Many of the shorts are scenes with songs (not stories). However, there are some that do have story lines to them, just don't expect story lines with all of the shorts.

(3) Also, for those who get offended easily there is some stereo-typing of certain groups in certain shorts. However, then in other shorts (with same group) there is nothing offensive about it. It really depends on the short you watch.

(4) There are a lot of shorts which refers to the ""Phillips"" brand radios. It's a little irritating at times. Advertising at it's finest.

(5) The music gets into your blood. I find myself watching this DVD just to hear specific songs. The one which has stuck in my head goes like this, ""tonight I must forget those precious hours, no hearts, no flowers.""

(6) Most of them are beautifully done, and are worth watching several times. It is also interesting to watch some of the special features. For example, I didn't know that in Pal's earlier works his puppets were mostly wood! So each puppet was it's own carved piece. That is awesome!",1299369600,,1260,4.683257918552036

733286,4,6303917224,"Indeed,what IS that fumigating the atmosphere,as the scarecrow wondered aloud in ""Jaspar and the Haunted House""? Well it is pioneer animator/puppeteer George Pal. Arnold Leibovit has packaged and presents a myriad of cartoon shorts from George Pals'prolific era of output for our enjoyment.
George Pal,born Gyorgy Pal Marczincsk in Hungary,was 20 years old when he graduated from the Budapest Acadamy of Arts with a degree in Architecture. He was a very fine drawer and moved into the area of films where he drew lobby posters and embellished film titles. Gradually he learned the art of film animation. In the early 30s he worked for the famed German company UFA where he became head of their cartoon department and where he would finally delve into the world of stop motion animation. His work and repuation got him a job in Holland where he honed his skills doing film commercials for Phillips radio. He would utilize in his shorts top name talents such as British bands led by Henry Hall,Ambrose and Jack Hylton.
With the war looming Pal decided to move with his new born son to the States where his work got him a job with Paramount pictures. He would return back to Holland once more to retrieve his wife and then permanently return to the U.S. where he sealed his legendary reputation in stop motion animation. Instead of using just one puppet many times in different poses,he would create many different expressions that he would interchange for each emotion he wanted to project.
Pal and his fine crew,which would include for a time King Kong creator Willis O'Brien and the man he in turn influenced Ray Harryhausen(he worked on Pal's first 12 shorts),made upwards of 40 films. The only reason Pal stopped was to go into feature films where he created some memorable ones,such as ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Time Machine"".
The first presentation on the DVD is ""The Puppetoon Movie"" that Leibovit wrote and produced some years ago,which comes in around 80 minutes. You can view the movie in toto or view each puppetoon in the movie seperately. The second segment of this DVD includes more puppetoon shorts,some from the movie which didn't have all the credits included and other different ones. My favourite Pal puppetoons have always been(and always will be)those starring Jaspar. There are only four included here and I hope that more can be released later. As an aside,a recent auction on Oct. 9/09 at [...] of over 100 original Jaspar puppets along with the scarecrow,fetched a cool $13,000!Pal paraphenalia is certainly hot stuff! Also I must tell you that there is a clipping of the dialogue in ""Jaspar and the Haunted House"".Right at the start where the scarecrow says""What's dat fumigatin' de atmosphere?"",blackbirds' response is not heard due to a glitch in the source film soundtrack. This is disappointing. In case you're wondering,what he is supposed to say is ""Yeah,what's that smellin' up the landscape?"".
There is also an interview with one of Pal's animators Bob Baker,the theatrical trailer for the movie and a production photo gallery.
All in all this DVD is a very welcome release and an historical treasure of stop motion animation by one of its' legendary exponents. The shorts range in dates from the the late 30s to the late 40s,and everywhere in between. They have been culled from various film depositories in the U.S. and in Europe. Their conditions vary but all things considered they look and sound pretty good. This release certainly whets ones' appetite for more and it is hoped by this reviewer that that is indeed what transpires in the near future. But for now I advise you to get your copy while the gettings good.",1255305600,,3657,4.890499194847021
733287,5,6303917224,"I saw these cartoons originally on TV in the 1950's. What a surprise to find many of them packaged with the Puppetoon Movie in this DVD. It brought back wonderful memories. Learning that the stop-action process used hundreds of wood-carved and painted figures to produce these cartoons makes them all the more amazing.

I'd love to see the entire Puppetoon collection made available on DVD.",1250640000,,390,5.0
733288,4,6303917224,"George Pal's Puppettoons are unknown to today's kids, but when I was a boy, they were on TV along with cartoons, and I loved them. They have the charm, wit and the magic which George Pal brought to all his work. Best of all, there are so many bonus puppettoons that it's like getting two whole featrues. The only quibble is that a few of the ""Extra"" puppettoons are ones in the main feature, only in somewhat longer form. For fans of stop-motion animation, or just fans of charming shorts, this is a great collection.",1167955200,,517,4.4526315789473685
733289,4,6303917224,George Pal's Puppetoons are great.  I remember watching them 45 years ago whilst growing up.  I was hopeing for a few more toons with The Screw Ball Army in them but one is better than none.  Well worth the little money I paid.,1140652800,,227,4.232558139534884
733290,4,6303917224,"Before the movies there were the Puppetoons.  Everyone who knows LooneyToons, Max Fleischer, and Disney should know George Pal's work as well.  'Jasper in a Jam', 'Tubby the Tuba' and 'John Henry and the Inkeypoo' are classics; the rest has bright spots here and there and is worthwhile if only for the advertising and political history.  (Ignore the contrived intro and outro of the movie and focus on Pal's work.)

A companion piece: 'The Fantasy Film World of George Pal' covers his movies, including 'The Time Machine', 'War of the Worlds', 'Destination Moon', 'Atlantis', 'Tom Thumb', 'The Brothers Grimm' and 'The Seven Faces of Dr. Loa'.",1125360000,,644,5.047169811320755
733291,3,6303917224,"It could have been more satisfying! There, of course, is the requisite ""Tubby the Tuba"", but just ONE piece featuring the Screwball Army! There were NUMEROUS Pal Puppetoon productions featuring these comical takes on fascism! Where's the Dr. Seuss ""Mulberry Street"" short? The short with the clarinet playing woodchopper? The other ""Punchy & Judys""? (I wonder if the creators of ""Little Lulu"" ever commented on those!) And why so many from the thirties?? Most of Pal's best output of these little gems was in the forties and fifties....

Pal's Puppetoon work had a singular artistry to it. The figures moved unlike most other stop-action animated units, most of which generally just try to put across the tableau as plainly as possible. Pal's creations REACTED like cartoon characters...wild takes, feature distortion, ambient movement...all very idiosyncratic. The only other animation to be that generous with detailed movement were the Warner's Looney Tunes/Merry Melodies made between 1940 and 1955.

Most of them were funny, charming and quirky and embraced the art deco aesthetic like nothing else I've ever seen in animated art. What Pal's people could wring out of simple geometric shapes was amazing, and you'll notice, that's about all that they used...no weird freehand polygons are visible in the animation work...just spheroids, cones, rods and other distinct geometric solids. The only exception to this seems to be the ""Punchy & Judy"" bits.

His animation team must have suffered from gawrsh-awful cases of carpal tunnel syndrome and writer's cramp, because this was all incrementally implemented BY HAND to give the illusion of fluid movement. They just don't make them like that anymore...and this DVD should have featured fewer of the movie house adverts for Philips radios and Horlock's malteds and more of our old afternoon cartoon show favorites!",1085270400,,1867,5.322033898305085
733292,5,6303917224,"What you are getting on this DVD is actually TWO MOVIES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE!
First, you get `The Puppetoon Movie' which was a theatrical release in 1987.  It was a labor of love written and directed by Arnold Leibovit and was born out of the highest regard for George Pal's marvelous Puppetoons from the 30's and 40's.  It opens however with a somewhat inept Gumby skit wherein Pokey and Arnie the T-Rex proceed to initiate Gumby into the world of George Pal by sitting him down and showing him some Puppetoons.  I advise you to skip this chapter and launch right into the second through the tenth chapters which are nine Puppetoons conveniently divided by chapters:
*1. The Little Broadcast (1943) and The Big Broadcast of '38 (1937)
*2. Hoola Boola (1938?) and South Sea Sweethearts (1938) for Horlick's
3. Sleeping Beauty (1935) for Phillips
4. Tulips Shall Grow (1942)
5. Together In The Weather  (1946)
6. John Henry and the Inky Poo (1946)
7. Phillips Cavalcade (1934-9?) for Phillips Radio
8. Jasper in a Jam (194?)
9. Tubby the Tuba (1947) The last Puppetoon short made.
*Puppetoons 1 and 2 (unfortunately) each consist of two Puppetoons edited and spliced together!  -why?  The other ones have their logos and credits removed in an attempt to create a cavalcadesque Puppetoons show, somewhat disappointingly shorn in effect.
  All of the Puppetoons were made before television was invented, when the movie theater was the true pinnacle of the dream vision manifest experience, although there were radios in practically every home.  George Pal financed several of his Puppetoons by funding from clients who were basically paying to have their products' recognition foisted on an unsuspecting movie-going public.  These advertisements were shown before feature films, and they were nonetheless successful because they used a soft sell approach with the product not appearing until late in the film, and even then it was almost a parody of itself.
  Phillips Radio Manufactures was one of the first companies to utilize Pal's films for advertising. Radio was the ""TV"" of the time. Different kinds of music from around the world provided a perfect backdrop for Pal's animation, which works wonderfully when set to music.  Horlick's Malted Milk was another one of Pal's many advertising clients. The product was a ""tonic"" which would make the drinker ""energetic"" almost like Popeye and his spinach.
  'The Bonus Puppetoons' is the second movie and alone is worth the price of the disk!  It is probably more of what you may actually be looking for.  It is twelve uncut Puppetoons complete with titles and logos. Three of these Puppetoons (4, 6, and 11) are complete versions of ones cropped in 'The Puppetoon Movie' and all twelve are crisper and clearer too. Definitely satisfying.
1. What Ho, She Bumps (1937) for Horlick's
2. Bravo, Mr. Strauss (1943)
3. Olio for Jasper  (1946)
4. Phillips Cavalcade (1934-9?) for Phillips Radio
5. Jasper's Derby (1946)
6. Hoola Boola (1938?)
7. Ether Symphony (1936)
8. Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1936)
9. The Magic Atlas (1935) for Phillips
10. Jasper and the Haunted House (1942)
11. The Big Broadcast of '38 (1937) for Phillips
12. Ether Ship (1934) for Phillips, (made with beautiful glass models!)

733293,4,6303917224,"After viewing this movie, I realized why Puppetoons were not popular in the USA. Even tho they are cute and charming and cutting edge for their time, these were really just commercials!!!!
Phillips Radios, Horlicks Malted Milk...
The figures are adorable and the stop motion animation is almost flawless but these were commercials for radios, etc.
Still, its a good DVD. Entertaining",1064275200,,383,5.193548387096774
733294,5,6303917224,"I have a few Puppetoons on the cheap UK PAL VHS tapes sold from public domain prints and I liked the price so I bought this DVD...
What a revelation, the actual movie by Mr Leibovit is good; the puppetoons are showcased well and he doesn't flinch from showing the commercial origins of some. The additional animation is OK I guess..they like sugar in the USA but....having watched the movie and liked it, I find in the Extras an interesting talk by one of George Pal's animators, AND a wedge of unedited puppetoons so they can be watched title to tail as all films should.
These films are simply exquisite in the detail and effort that went into, say, a cinema advert for Horlicks; this is a disc I shall be returning to almost as much as my Iwerks and B/W Mickey Mouse....they are all perfect works of art in themselves. The subtle humour and emotion expressed in stop motion puppets  is out of this world and something that won't be seen again. I have always adored the clean modern style of the late 1930s and the advertising films reflect their time superbly. The golden age of style and superlatives.
(Actually having a 1938 Philips when I was a boy, cost me 1/- (5 new pence) and sold it for a couple of quid doesn't influence me much...oh no)
Buy this. It will repay every cent you spent on it",1061424000,,1300,4.416666666666667
733295,5,6303917224,"I can't believe anyone would be offended by George Pal, a true pioneer in the animation field.  A great friend of Walt Disney and Walt Lantz, many of their characters appeared in the backgrounds of scenes of pictures he produced.
  I grew up on pictures like, 'Jasper and the Scarecrow',  'The 500 Hats of Barthalamew Cubbins' and 'To Think I Saw it All on Mullberry Street'.
  Ray Harryhausen worked for George very early on.
  Gene Roddenberry met George Pal before there was a 'Star Trek', of course it was Lucy Ball that gave the ""Go Ahead"" for 'Trek', but it would have never been if not for George Pal.
  Watch all his films and 'Puppetoons',  It's well worth it!!!!",1059350400,,672,4.563025210084033

Even without these bonus features, ""The Puppetoon Movie"" is a delight to view, showcasing Pal's most endearing featurettes as a stop-motion animator.  Wonderful for children and entertaining for adults, there's even a retro-appeal to those of us who have grown up watching Gumby and Pokey, who, appropriately enough, host this loving look back at Pal's fanciful genius, and attest to their television existence being the outgrowth of Pal's early animation works.  As a sort of ""Thank You"" to George Pal, there's a scene with Gumby and just about any TV stop-motion animated character you can think of, from Speedy Alka-Seltzer to the Pop 'n' Fresh Doe Boy, gathered together in gratitude to Pal for their actuated lives. I tip my hat to you, yet again Arnold, for not only putting these joyful featurettes together for us to re-appreciate the early works of a man with a contagious child-like and pixie-esque grin, and a name that was almost synonymous with fantasy itself, Pal, but you've exceeded yourself by adding much more to this whimsical collection on the DVD release, to make it more thoroghly enjoyable to watch, collect and own for the generations to come.",974505600,,1759,5.027491408934708

This is a great collection of small puppet films, many of them advertising for ""Phillips"", it seems.  However, I do miss one particular of these rare ""Phillips"" films.  -It involves a laughing man going to a fairground attraction, trying  everything; shooting, hitting, rollercoaster, etc, finally ending up in his  armchair watching TV. It's a marvellous piece of work, with probably more  puppets moving than in any of the others. Perhaps collector of this  production Arnold Leibovit can clue me in, why it wasn't included. Stop  motion is truly high art, and much more atmospheric than cartoons. It  deserves more attention and respect, than I feel it gets. It can be a  million times more scary and eerie than any form of hand-drawn animation,  in my opinion. -Could this be the reason movies and television prefers the  ""safer"" cartoons ?. We're drowning in cartoons !. The world needs  a puppet channel !. Thank God for people like Pal, Zeman, Trnka, Quay,  Svankmajer, Park, Starewitz, etc, etc.",935884800,,1105,4.940217391304348

7855902,5,6303917224,"What a wonderful discoverythe career of George Pal and his marvelous Puppetoons-era all in one set of discs. And, first, let me thank a couple of the other 5-star reviewers for explaining all the wonderful surprises in this set. The problem is that the front cover doesn't even hint at what's inside. However, on this Amazon page, you can enlarge the image of the back cover and you'll see the extra gems included in this package.

In short: You're not only getting the actual Puppetoon Movie, which is a compilation of individual Puppetoons, including my personal favorite: a from-the-heart dramayes a Puppetoon dramaset in Holland during the Nazi invasion in World War II. In this case, dangerous creatures called ""Screwballs"" fill in for the Nazis but the point is the same. Pal and his wife had the heart-breaking experience of trying to keep one step ahead of the Nazis and lived a while in the Netherlandsthen, watched what happened as the war kept relentlessly marching West. IN ADDITION, you'll find ""The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal,"" a documentary about Pal's entire career that was shown in autumn 2017 on Turner Classic Movies, plus lots of individual Puppetoons. This is a Puppetoon-themed salute to an entire career within one Blu-ray set.

But I want to share two other perspectives in this review.

One is that, if you're like my wife and I in your love of classic movies from the 1930s and 1940s and even some of the 1950s, then George Pal is a giant in cinematic innovation throughout that era. Today, his Puppetoons may look a bit clumsy compared with modern 3D digital animation. But, for their time, they were masterpieces that amazed audiences. As a kid, watching these when they showed up on TV in the '50s and early '60s, I remember I was astonished thatin my childhood eyes""toys can come to life."" Personally, I'm also a big fan of Ray Harryhausen, whose movie-making career coincided with Pal's later career making feature films. But, in fact, Ray Harryhausen owed a huge debt to George Pal's much earlier innovations. So, no, this isn't like buying a Pixar Blu-ray set of short films. Don't expect that style of animation. This is something quite differentyet surprisingly endearing and fanciful if viewed through sympathetic eyes.

The second point is to underline that this set ALSO includes a fresh copy of The Great Rupert, which my wife and I discovered a couple of years ago in our quest to see all the classic Hollywood Christmas movies we could find. We discovered the movie under the much later, alternative title, A Christmas Wish. In fact, the comedy, starring Jimmy Durante, was George Pal's debut in feature film production. George ""animated"" the squirrel who is responsible for the central plot twist in this tall tale. We love the movie, rewatch it most years in our ""Christmas favorites"" selections, and it's terrific to see The Great Rupert included in this set dedicated to Pal's innovations in cinema.

If you like the fuller descriptions you're reading in several of our 5-star reviews on this page, then you're sure to enjoy hourseasily several hours at leastwith the three main movies and the extras in this set.",1508803200,,3166,4.877323420074349
