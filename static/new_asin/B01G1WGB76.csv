8761962,4,B01G1WGB76,"Season 4 of Wentworth isn't quite as good as the first three.  It doesn't quite jump the shark, but becomes a lot less realistic with who becomes an inmate at Wentworth.  It's never been a completely realistic show, but when compared to other prison shows like Orange is the New Black, has certainly seemed a lot more so than those.  Still once you go with the unlikely prisoner, it's still a good season.  One of the prison guards from the previous season's storyline doesn't return for season 4.  We're just told as someone refers to him in a conversation that he's moved to Tasmania to become a farmer or something like that.  But the others are back, with Vera now the Governor.  Frankie is of course out on parole, again the realistic factor of stuff she does, such as visit current Wentworth prisoners, seems fairly unlikely since usually the first rule of parole is that you can't associate with known criminals.  Bea has a few new contenders for top dog, not helped by her muscle women both having issues of their own, but her biggest hurdle is mental.  Shes bored behind bars and to be honest her character was a bit boring to watch this season, and a bit unlikable too.

Still it's a great show and I can't wait to watch season 5.

Update 28 September - Just finished the 5th season and came on Amazon to review it, only to learn they have combined the reviews of both products together.  So here's my review of Season 5.  If you haven't watched Season 4, obviously how that one ends is going to be given away below.

Season 5 is pretty similar to four plot wise.  However Wentworth Prison obviously has a huge power vacuum now that Bea is not around.  Allie is looking weaker and weaker in the eyes of the other women since she refuses to get violent to keep the place drug free or punish with violence Bea's murderer.  Ferguson of course is still manipulating the whole situation, as well as trying to erode Vira's confidence bit by bit. Liz is having mixed thoughts about making up a fictional story against an inmate in return for freedom. A new guard joins the team who both Vira and Ferguson take an interest in.  Frankie on the outside is being hassled by the host of the TV show she burnt with the hot oil which sent her to prison years ago. Disappointingly it's a different actor in that former TV host's role.",1537574400,,2329,4.465721040189125

8761968,1,B01G1WGB76,"we can't get season 4 in the region 1 USA format..........You are going to lose customers taking so long getting each season out.

Now it's May 2018 and still no Region 1 for US viewers. A damn shame....

When is the fourth season gonna ever come out in the Region 1 format. Can't you at least tell if it is ever going to be released. This is like having 3/4ths of a story and no ending.!!!!Really bad for business, makes me never want to start another Aussie movie or series again. Why do you even carry any regions in this country other than region 1??????????",1498003200,17,562,4.3428571428571425
