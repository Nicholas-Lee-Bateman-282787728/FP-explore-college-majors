8645385,3,B00ITN5R58,"This collection of four Blu-rays offers different stories. One is that of a major conductor and his world-famous orchestra. Another is of the superb programming that highlights the European orchestral tradition. The third, considered here in greater detail, is the effect of venue upon performance quality. Purchasers of the set can consider this a plus or minus but this listener found the latter to be the case.
The orchestra is presented in four different lights -- first in its traditional concert hall setting, second in a extraordinarily large outdoor venue, third in a trendy warehouse-like building, and fourth in a conservatory hall while on tour.
The first and fourth venues permit acceptable acoustic surroundings and the resulting performances are full five-star events.
The outdoor setting at the huge Waldbuhne in Berlin is a sad contrast. The best programming of the set (""Russian Rythms"" with the Nutcracker, Rachmaninoff's 3rd, and the Rite of Spring) is sabotaged by 1) difficult stage acoustics, 2) a loud baby crying during the pianist's most sensitive moment, and 3) rain throughout the Stravinsky.
While the Nutcracker performance shows how well the group can play in such a setting, the meat of the concert will not support repeated listening. How many times can you listen to the heroic effort of Yefim Bronfam to hold the first movement Rachmaninoff cadenza together when the loud crying from the grounds in front of the orchestra has stolen everyone's attention? Once, it's funny...
The open air venue offered by the third disk (Kabelwerk Oberspree) shows how a lack of reflecting sound can lower the orchestra's ability to play together tightly. Attacks are obscured just a little, tempos sometime drift, and the sectional evenness and blend suffer. The Brahms 4th comes together towards during the fourth movement and from there to the end it is a different and successful result.
So, likely purchasers can make their own mind up as to the value of this set. The text description above is more likely to help rather than the somewhat artificial star rating system. Those who have as their goal the understanding of the Berliner Philharmoniker and Simon Rattle will get a five-star picture of all of their activities from these four disks. Those who purchase orchestral Blu-rays for repeated listening will likely return to the two outer disks and refer to the inner ones only for special purpose (e.g., ""Have you ever heard a baby destroy Rachmaninoff?).
This reviewer suggests that Rattle should keep the concert hall Blu-rays coming. Chailly and the Gewandhaus are showing how well this can be done.",1409097600,2,2629,5.130536130536131
8645386,5,B00ITN5R58,"This boxed set of four Blu-rays, previously only available in Japan to accompany the orchestra's tour there, brings together four discs which have generally been much praised for their musical reward as well as for their good technical qualities as recordings in a number of venues and under differing circumstances. Two of the discs have been previously available as Blu-rays while the Wagner/Brahms and the Stravinsky/Bruch/Beethoven discs are here presented for the first time on Blu-ray.

Euroarts will soon release blu-ray versions of these last two discs separately. This will be welcome news for collectors who have already invested in the blu-rays of the Mussorgsky / Borodin and the Tchaikovsky / Rachmaninov / Stravinsky discs.

The following review summaries are the result of comparing the new discs with the previous Blu-ray or DVD versions.

....................................................................
The Mussorgsky / Borodin disc (also available separately)

This Russian-themed concert from 2007 is performed at the expected high standards of the BPO under Simon Rattle. Its success, when judged against the highest of interpretive standards, is a little more varied however while still being an enjoyable concert overall.

The opening Polovtsian Dances make a good opening number and are given a comfortably secure reading which makes full use of the tonal resources of the orchestra. It is the following second symphony of Borodin that doubts really start to appear. This is a very major Russian work and the Russian temperament ideally needs to be fully exposed. It is this aspect that is so obviously missing, especially in the opening movement. Those who are familiar with the famous Decca recording of the work with Martinon conducting the LSO on top form will know exactly what is meant here. That performance sizzles from the start and serves as a good example that it does not require a Russian orchestra and/or conductor to achieve the Russian volatility that is missing here. Nevertheless on non-Russian criteria, the Borodin pieces could still be described as very good, mid-European performances.

The Mussorgsky half of this concert by contrast, is totally successful. The Pictures at an Exhibition, as orchestrated by Ravel, is also more European in its conceptual nature and suits this orchestra well. The music has long been a staple item in the orchestra's repertoire, even going back to an admired recording by Karajan in the 1960's. The piece features many solo passages and it is in these that the individual players excel. The larger moments also suit the accumulative tonal resources and power of this impressive group of musicians. They finally let their musical hair down in the Shostakovich encore from The Golden Age. The Khovanshchina introduction is an object lesson in sustained quiet expressive playing, even almost to the point of inaudibility at times.

The imaging throughout this disc is very crisp and of excellent colour rendition. The camera work is involving throughout. The sound is faithfully reproduced and presented in DTS-HD 5.1 as well as stereo. There is no detectable difference between this Blu-ray and the previous separate Blu-ray issue of this disc.

............................................

The Tchaikovsky / Rachmaninov / Stravinsky disc (also available separately)

This is a memorable release on several counts. The obvious one is that, unusually, the audience was treated to a heavy rainstorm during the second half of the concert but despite this the audience displays total good humour and absorption in the music regardless of the awful conditions. This reflects the quality of music making in what must be described as less than ideal circumstances.

The evening starts with four well-known items from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker - The overture, Christmas tree, March and Pas de deux. This music suits the Berliners perfectly showing their famed control and tonal resources to good effect.

Rachmaninov's 3rd piano Concerto follows with Yefim Bronfmann as the soloist who delivers a towering performance of comprehensive emotional range and subtlety. Bronfman demonstrates phenomenal technique that rides over all the hurdles at speeds and accuracy that is simply spellbinding and is combined with wonderful delicacy of touch as required on frequent occasions. The Berlin players respond with sonority and musicianship under the superbly attentive conductor, Simon Rattle, who maintains close eye contact with Bronfman for considerable stretches of time. The audience erupts with an utterly deserved and prolonged standing ovation having maintained rapt silence throughout. Even the orchestra exhibits their shared delight in what has been an especially memorable performance.

The Rite of Spring fills the majority of the second half. Rattle's long experience of the music and its complexity shows throughout with many details brought out to good effect. The orchestra responds with all the virtuosity at their considerable command. The audience's concentration persists despite heavy rain at intermittent points. Once again they are rewarded with an outstanding performance despite the demanding circumstances. (see below for comment about recording / playback levels).

There is an encore - the intrada pas de deux from the Nutcracker which is the perfect foil for the Stravinsky with washes of rich string tone, swooping woodwind and burnished brass topped with glittering percussion. Perfect. An ebullient Berliner Luft ends the evening as Simon Rattle leaves the podium to take up the cymbal, reminding us of his early days as percussionist in the National Youth Orchestra.

The HD imaging is superb and the sound, delivered in PCM 5.1 and stereo, is remarkably good considering the open-air nature of the venue and the awful weather conditions experienced through much of the second part of the concert. I would suggest that the playback level would benefit an increase of about 2 dB as the recording level appears to be slightly lower than usual. This benefits the Rite of Spring especially as it allows more internal detail to tell as well as adding more general weight. I have been unable to detect any hint of the synchronisation problems mentioned by another reviewer, neither on this Blu-ray nor on my previous DVD version. There is no discernible difference between this Blu-ray and the previous separate Blu-ray release of the disc.

This amounts to a fine concert in less than ideal circumstances with the Rachmaninov concerto being especially notable as a performance of tremendous stature.

...............................................................

The Stravinsky / Bruch / Beethoven disc (first appearance as a blu-ray)

This 2008 edition in the series of concerts held by the BPO every year on May 1 to celebrate its founding was held in the Tchaikovsky Conservatory - the same setting as the previous concert with Karajan in 1969.

The chosen pieces for the concert make an interesting mix. The concert opens with Stravinsky's Symphony in 3 Movements which may well have been unfamiliar territory for many in the (young) audience. However the performance has been part of Simon Rattle's repertoire for a very long time and here it receives an immaculate performance. The textures are kept very clear with every strand of the orchestration easily identified. The expertly chosen tempi allow for this clarity and the performance avoids any trace of heaviness. It receives polite applause at the end.

The next item features the popular and gifted violinist Vadim Repin who delivers a serenely lyrical interpretation of Bruch's romantic Violin concerto 1. This performance allows time for each phrase to breathe naturally and, once again, any trace of heaviness is avoided. This concerto suits the capabilities of the Berlin strings perfectly and the whole effect is one of a sustained soaring song. The more virtuoso passages are taken very quickly and with immaculate accuracy and with seeming ease. Not surprisingly this performance receives a more enthusiastic reception than the previous Stravinsky.

The concert ends with a rousing performance of Beethoven's Symphony 7 which concludes with a satisfying blaze of brass from the horns and trumpets. Although the symphony is played by a sizeable modern orchestra it is clear that both Rattle and the players are well aware of current thinking as regards authentic performance style. As a result the tempi are kept on the move and, once again, undue heaviness is avoided although it is quite clear that this is the weightiest item on the program. The audience clearly enjoyed this performance and respond accordingly.

The imaging is good and the camera work shows a complete understanding of the scores as is typical of the Paul Smaczny team. The sound formats are presented in DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo. It is worth mentioning in addition that the balance of the solo violin in the concerto is more naturally balanced than is often the case with no significant artificial highlighting of the solo line.

The blu-ray mastering has been achieved with considerable success, and like the Brahms disc, the transition from DVD to blu-ray has resulted in greater clarity of both sound and vision akin to a veil being raised.

This is another very fine disc in its entirety

............................................

The Wagner / Brahms disc (first appearance as a blu-ray)

This disc is outstanding throughout and well up to the standard of the best of this series of Europe concerts given by the BPO. The concert program has deliberate and considerable links with the orchestra's history as the Parsifal Prelude was included in the very first subscription concert in 1882 and the two pieces by Brahms have been core repertoire for much of the orchestra's lifetime. In this case the performance was dedicated to the memory of Rostropovich.

The concert starts with the slow-moving but sonically sumptuous Parsifal Overture by Wagner as referred to above. This is well suited to the orchestra's sound world, requiring sumptuous textures allied with clarity of detail and sustained over long, drawn-out phrases. This is a very satisfying reading and also serves to illustrate the apparently fine acoustical properties of the Power and Cable factory in Berlin.

The concert then continues with a particularly satisfying performance of the Brahms Double Concerto. The disc is worth buying for this alone. The two soloists, Lisa Batiashvili and Truls Mork share what seems to be a very natural and instinctive musical rapport and this lifts the performance of this closely integrated work onto a completely different level to that which is often achieved. There are moments of sublime beauty to be found in each movement but the finale is notable for concluding the work in a notably joyous manner. This is music making of a very high order and the generally forward pacing is strikingly effective.

The concert concludes with a deeply satisfying performance of the Symphony 4 and, as always, there is a great deal to be gained by watching an interpretation or performance unfolding before our very eyes so to speak. The music has been deeply embedded into the orchestra's sub-conscious for years with many memorable recordings of different characteristics to its credit. The equally fine but contrasted recordings by Karajan and Abbado are testament to the orchestra's ability to adjust and still deliver music making of excellence. That tradition or ability is here continued with this latest fine account from Simon Rattle which is characterised by an enhanced sense of drama and drive balanced by a keen sense of sensitivity in the less dramatic sections. The wide ranging emotional delivery of the final movement is a good example of this range of expression and brings the symphony to a particularly strong and exciting conclusion.

The sound provides excellent spread and fidelity in DTS 5.1 and there is also the usual stereo option. The imaging is crisp in the usual HD manner and gives good colour and tonal depth.

This is a particularly fine disc in every respect and is fully deserving of serious consideration from collectors. The improvement offered by this blu-ray over the DVD is like that of a veil being lifted and this applies to both the imaging and the sound.

................................................
