2257578,5,B0008EN6K4,"Stuntwomen...what you need to know - they are hot...k nuff said. No seriously. These lady's O leaping jump in and out of danger to make other prissy chicks look good. Zoe Bell and Jeannie Epper befriend each other and discuss the trials and tribulations of being a woman in a predominantley male field.

you haven't seen it? Well now's your chance. The DVD boasts interviews with Tarantino (as he waxes on about his love of Xena), Spielberg, and Lucy Lawless. You see Jeannie deal with getting old in a young industry, Zoe landing the job on Kill Bill and the hilarity of what it takes to stay at the top of their game.

Buy it Pee ON!",1116806400,9,635,4.418803418803419
2257579,5,B0008EN6K4,"I got a chance to see this movie in San Francisco a few weeks back and I absolutely fell in love with it. The story revolves two stuntwomen, one starting her career and one on the tail end of her career. You see the ups and downs of trying to get a career started and the ups and downs of trying to get one going. It's hard enough being a stuntperson at all, let alone being a woman in a job domminated by men.

The cameos in the movie by the likes of Steven Spielberg, and Quentin Tarantino are just added bonuses to make an already great movie just that much more interesting.

This is a great look at what goes on behind the scenes in a way you've probably never seen before. If you're a fan of action films, of filmmaking, or just of women who kick ass then pre-order this baby now. I just did.",1115164800,20,798,4.076433121019108

2257581,5,B0008EN6K4,Bought this because of Xena and fell in love with Zoe Bell and Jeannie Epper as they try to make it as stunt women in the movies. This is a great documentary of their experiences of trying to get jobs and stay healthy during a stunt shoot. Very eye opening. Buy this if you are a Xena fan for sure. But this if you are a film buff because Jeannie Epper is a legend. Her family are like stunt movie royalty in the business.,1425427200,,422,4.035714285714286

We were probably talking Tarentino at the time and Zoe Bell and this movie came up.  He was going to lend me his copy, but I was determined to have my own.  I loved it.  Got it from Amazon in just a few days and watched it immediately.  Wonder Woman was a long time ago and I didn't recognize the name Jeannie Epper, but the movie sure did educate me, and brought back many memories.

I didn't know she had been Lucy Lawless's stunt double for the run of Xena warrior princess . I did not know the program was not made in the states . I first saw Zoe in Q.T.s DEATHWISH half of GRINDHOUSE when i saw (with a handful of other people) that film theatrically . The woman who helps zoe get her foot in Hollywood is a really fantastic woman . Her story is as interesting as Zoe's .

2257591,3,B0008EN6K4,"Double Dare is a documentary about two women who work performing stunts in Hollywood. One of the women (Zoe Bell) is a newcomer from New Zealand; the other (Jeannie Epper) is a 60-ish veteran trying to show that she's ""still got it"". Both women face an uphill climb against sexism and difficult competition.

This is an interesting film. Dare provides a ""behind-the scenes"" look at how Hollywood produces its magic. There is lots of action, as the filmmakers do a great job of filming stunts. Also, viewers get a good sense of both women's personalities. Double

While I liked Double Dare, the two stories are uneven. Zoe Bell's story is more satisfying because it has a clear beginning-middle-and end. Jeannie Epper's segments should have been better. She is from a family of ""stuntpeople"" and she started working when few women performed stunts. Unfortunately, Double Dare provides only a narrow ""slice of life"" for Jeannie; viewers see her trying to hang on and her story meanders to an unsatisfying close.

In summary, Double Dare is an action-filled documentary about two women daredevils.",1275868800,,1094,5.033149171270718
2257592,5,B0008EN6K4,This was a highly entertaining and informative video on stuntwomen new and veteran alike.  Loved stuntman legend Terry Leonard's comments on problems stuntwomen face that the men don't encounter.  Have watched this DVD over and over.  Well worth the money.,1269475200,,256,5.35
2257593,4,B0008EN6K4,"Double Dare offers a great look into the world of female stunt-women as we follow the blossoming career of Zoe Bell and the closing chapters of Jeannie Epper. Zoe Bell is well known after her role in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof where she portrayed herself in a dramatic car chase movie. Double Dare follows the charismatic Zoe from her final days on set of Xena in New Zealand all the way to Hollywood where she is picked up to double on Kill Bill. The film isn't the best documentary I've ever seen but Zoe Bell takes the audience along on here wild adventures and makes for a great story. Fans of Kill Bill will enjoy a glimpse into the behind the scenes although not enough for my liking.

Double Dare is an eye opener into the stunt world and just how important these people, often over looked, are to the film industry.",1262822400,,828,4.447368421052632

2257596,5,B0008EN6K4,"That was the quickest 210 minutes I've spent in a LONG time.  These two women, Jeannie Epper and Zoe Bell, are fascinating.  The stunt world seems to be about half carnie and half Hollywood...I'd say the best of both worlds.

Jeannie is totally remarkable for her generosity, both in her encouragement and help toward the young Zoe, and in her life in general--obviously very giving to her family and she even gave a KIDNEY to her unrelated friend Ken Howard!  I'd never heard that story before--wow.

Less of the personal side of Zoe was shown, but what we did see was how remarkably her body has always done what she wants.  As someone who couldn't even do a cartwheel as a child, I am in awe and very envious.

This was a terrific documentary.  The editing was tight and it had zero slow spots for me, but then I'm a big documentary fan.  As I noted at the beginning, the movie flew by.  Like Wonder Woman!",1225065600,,909,4.421686746987952

2257598,5,B0008EN6K4,"Wow, I've been so thirsty for material on stunt women and this was a drop of water in a very dry bucket. I've been long time fascinated with the women who bring my favorite super hero's into action. Being a female I'm naturally more interested in female super ""hera's"" and the relationship between actor and ""stuntor"". To make the scene come off seamless they really have to collaborate like synchronized ballerinas to successfully pull off a convincing action sequence and it's utterly amazing. After watching this I did a little research on stunt women using Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a reference point and I was amazed to find out how many beautiful talented women there are in this industry. There are not too many clips for BtVS fans that show the making of action scenes where the stunt double steps in and the actor sashays out. But Double Dare takes you there, shows how much work both actor and stuntor do work together equally hard in different ways. If you are buying this strictly as a Lucy Lawless fan you will not get enough of her-she is an amazing woman and the few scenes with her are priceless and worth your collection, but this is about the unsung hera's, the stunt woman. Had I to do it over again, and knew such possibilities existed, I wouldn't have scoffed at gymnastics and been a stunt woman for sure.  Thanks to Quentin for making great women hera's and I appreciate your humor for killing your character every time you or someone else plays a misogynistic bastard-as if you're reading this LOL  Thanks to Joss Whedon as well. But mostly thanks to Jeannie Epper, Zoe Bell, Amanda Micheli,Sophia Crawford, Melissa Barker and countless other women who have pioneered this industry and to the men who recognized their talent and gave them the leg up in a male dominated role.",1194048000,,1801,4.678233438485805
2257599,5,B0008EN6K4,"I loved watching this - over and over... and over. It's not at all boring, not one second. You really get to see Zo and Jeannie in their almost day-to-day life. It's worth buying. I got it for my birthday and I've never been happier.",1187913600,,233,4.2
2257610,5,B0008EN6K4,"I'm in the film industry myself, and this is a great look at the inner workings; how hard life can be and how erratic careers can flow. Very highly recommended!",1187222400,,160,4.366666666666666
2257611,4,B0008EN6K4,"When Amanda Micheli started filming DOUBLE DARE, about two top female stunt doubles, she certainly had no idea how lucky she had become.  One of the two women was Jeannie Epper, one of the top female stuntwomen ever, a pioneer in a profession where women had previously been doubled by men (best illustrated in the film by a still photo of Irene Ryan, best known as Granny on THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, standing beside a man dressed up in an outfit similar to hers) and perhaps best known as the double for Lynda Carter on WONDER WOMAN.  Her inclusion in the documentary was basically a no brainer, but selecting Zo Bell had, in 2001 when filming began, to be something of a gamble.  Though she possessed over-the-top skills as a stunt double, she had only one item on her resume.  That one item, however, was doubling Lucy Lawless on XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS, perhaps the most stunt intensive role for a woman ever seen on television.  They certainly had no idea how Zo Bell's half of the story would develop and luckily for both her and Micheli the film ends with Bell in Beijing where she is filming the stunt scenes for Uma Thurman in Tarantino's KILL BILL.  The rest, as they say, is history.  Tarantino was one of the first directors ever to express strongly in public fashion how much a production had relied on the work of a stunt double.  He went on to make the film DEATHPROOF (the second half of GRINDHOUSE made with Robert Rodriguez), the second half of which was built around a stuntwoman riding on the hood of a Dodge Challenger while a car driven by a mad man slams into the car at high speeds.  It was a role written for Zo Bell and she pulled it off magnificently.

If much of the documentary focuses on the immensely talented up and comer Bell, it is equally focused on the pioneer Epper, who in her early sixties is finding work harder to come by but who is determined to keep working as long as she can.  Unlike Bell, who came to stunt doubling completely on her own (though I had wondered whether she was related to Peter Bell, who was the stunt coordinator on XENA -- she isn't), Epper is part of a large family of stunt doubles.  Her father, who is shown in some wonderful old sequences, was a leading stuntman, and her brother is a top stunt coordinator.  Her daughter is also a stuntwoman, though during the filming of the documentary her career was being hampered by a shoulder injury.  What the two women the film is built around have in common is that they are remarkably likable personalities.  Jeannie Epper comes across as a deeply caring and upbeat person, perhaps best illustrated by the fact that when her friend Ken Howard (THE WHITE SHADOW star) had to have a kidney transplant, she donated one of hers upon discovering that she was compatible with his blood type.  I'm not sure what more you can say about a person than that.  As for Zo Bell, her base facial expression seems to be a huge grin accentuated by the lip ring she wears most of the time when she isn't working (there is a very, very funny moment when Zo is asked by Epper whether her lip ring didn't interfere with a certain sex act made famous in the Clinton years and she replies that no, she is great at that particular act).  They both seem like people you would love to know.

The disc also comes with a lot of great deleted scenes.  Most of these center around Zo Bell on XENA.  There is also a scene that confirms what one often hears about XENA, that Renee O'Connor did much of her own stunt work.  And indeed, although there is a stunt double dressed much like O'Connor, she isn't called upon as O'Connor is able to do all of Gabrielle's fight scene.  I always thought that one of the ironies of XENA was that O'Connor, who played the sidekick, was actually the more athletic of the two actresses.  In fact, a number of affectionate but unflattering nicknames attached themselves to Lucy Lawless and I have suspected for a couple of years that the line that Lawless that spoke in the episode ""Downloaded"" in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, about always being a complete klutz after being resurrected (for non-initiates, on BSG Cylons, when they die, have their consciousness downloaded into a new and identical body).  Also, in the Season Three BSG gag reel produced for the wrap party (available on Youtube though it probably will be included in the Season Three DVD extras) there is a shot of Lawless walking down a sidewalk on the New Caprica set when she suddenly stumbles and falls forward.  But very much to her credit, in this film Lucy Lawless states that Xena was played by two women.  (And let me add that in every interview I've seen Lucy Lawless seems to be massively likable -- on top of this the two Kiwis I've known have also bee utterly loveable individuals.  Is everyone in New Zealand likable?)

I strongly recommend this film to just about anyone.  Fans of KILL BILL or XENA will love it for background for one of the hidden stars of both films.  Students of film will love it for getting a sense of how the role of women stunt doubles has grown over the years (anyone will recognize many of the stunts that Jeannie Epper is shown performing, such as Kathleen Turner's stunts in ROMANCING THE STONE).  And students of Gender Studies will appreciate the struggles that women have had in pursuing their profession (e.g., having to perform stunts with minimal padding because the actress they are doubling usually has a fairly revealing outfit on, so that Zo Bell had to do Xena's stunts wearing no padding on her arms).",1185840000,3,5530,4.543346774193548

You really get an inside look at some of the behind the scenes stunt stuff you never really get to see, and you see who Jeannie Epper and Zoe Bell are. This documentary shows you more than what happens on set. You get to see these women in their homes, and see their relationships with their family, friends, and with each other.

How hard they work and how much passion it takes. Jeannie Epper what a great lady. I didn't know how much I had enjoyed her work till I saw this. She was in Wonder Woman and Romancing The Stone I loved that and I was amazed that she is still working. What saddened me was that woman in the industry are still struggling. It seems strange since they take so much risk because there is no where to hide the padding that they are not honored more. I was just so pleased with this.

It provides an interesting look at the newcomer, Zoe, and her struggles in finding her way into this predominantly male profession.  The profile of the legendary Jeannie Epper was very intriguing to me.  At 60+ years of age, Jeannie is still going strong and still pursuing work.  Amanda Micheli has done an incredible job putting this film together.

The DVD also contains some great interview footage with Lynda Carter and Lucy Lawless.  The only disappointing aspect is the fact that more of Jeannie's Wonder Woman footage was not included.  As I understand it, Micheli wanted more footage, but Warner Brothers was not cooperative.  Who knows why???!!!

I also had the privilege of seeing this film in the theatre, along with a live Q & A sessions with Lynda Carter, Jeannie Epper, and Amanda Micheli.  What a thrill.  It was so great to hear Lynda and Jeannie recount their days on the Wonder Woman set and give praise to each other for their respective performances.

In an aggressively male dominated industry, there are women actively seeking equal treatment, to seemingly no avail. As to where a skilled stuntman could possibly work his way up to Stunt Coordinator or even second unit director, an equally talented stunt woman that pays her dues is left with a tathered body and a phone that hardly rings.
