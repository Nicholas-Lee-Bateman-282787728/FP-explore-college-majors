8408547,5,B003TRS8V4,"I got to know some of Szymanowski's music in a piano recital (and CD) by Piotr Anderszewski, and found his piano music quite fascinating.  I was excited when this opera release was announced, but hesitated a little bit after reading the first review.  I shouldn't have - it's great stuff.  Obviously, it will not suit everybody's taste, and yes, it is a weird production.  But the music won me over.  It is actually less thickly orchestrated than I expected, not anywhere close to the masses of sound you hear for example in Schreker's Die Gezeichneten (or Salome, for that matter).  It has some impressive choral music, and the Polish choirs that sing in this recording do an excellent job.  The singers are all more than adequate, and Mark Elder does a good job in keeping things cool in the pit; the music is very transparent and not at all muddy as one might fear.

The production has its moments, and some ideas work better than others.  The unit set and the lightning are impressive.  Things really only go down the deep end in the third act, which looks like it plays in a slaughterhouse.  But I think the production serves the music well.  I don't think that this is music that works well with traditional realistic sets.

I should mention that unlike the previous reviewer, I don't find the audio recording ""atrocious.""  I listened to it with headphones, and the sound and the balance are quite good.  It seems like there is a tiny delay in the sound compared to the picture, which is slightly annoying. (I base this on the blu-ray edition).

Overall, a very good production and recording of an opera that deserves to be produced more often.",1287964800,18,1650,4.637931034482759
