Not a lot in terms of extras, but then, that is not why we buy TV on DVD is it?",1168473600,,170,4.0
2559658,3,B000FBH3WW,This was a disappointing season for news radio - the story lines became dull and not nearly as funny.  It was still a decent show - but not nearly as good as the first three.,1167955200,4,174,3.9714285714285715
2559659,5,B000FBH3WW,"This is Phil Hartman's last season I believe. After this season it went downhill. This is some of the best comedy writing EVER, and includes performances from ER's Maura Tierney and Fear Factor's Joe Rogan. Recommended for fans of Seinfeld, though this humor is a bit broader than that.",1162684800,2,286,4.857142857142857
2559660,5,B000FBH3WW,"Yet another truly underappreciated piece of comic genius is finding new life & new fans on dvd.  Sitcoms rarely capture such lightning in a bottle with casting, writing, performance, and chemistry as perfectly as ""NewsRadio"" did.  Consistently sharp, occasionally weird, never maudlin and always, ALWAYS laugh-out-loud hilarious! A fitting epitaph for the late, great Phil Hartman, whose brilliance was taken from us too soon - relish the great character he created in Bill McNeil.  The stars aligned when this show was created and we should all laugh hysterically and give thanks for having it back again!",1158019200,3,606,5.291666666666667

2559662,5,B000FBH3WW,"Just my favorite show of all time.  Unfortunately overlooked by audiences, but it's comedic genious is in every episode which is just so rare in today's comedy arena.  Sometimes you miss jokes because you are still laughing from the last joke, which means the episodes have multiple watches.  I hope you enjoy!

I just wanted to add to the one's review who did not have information on episode 63.

Episode 63.  Look Who's Talking.  Dave and Lisa are surprised to learn that Bill is looking into adopting a baby.",1149033600,9,511,4.674157303370786
2559663,5,B000FBH3WW,"Warning:  Viewing ""NewsRadio"" can be addicting.  Even watching a few episodes can cause you rush out and by ever available season.  Season 3 was one of the best seasons ever (few sitcoms ever have seasons that great) and Season 4 picks up where S3 left off.

The episodes dealing with Matthew getting fired and then asked back is hysterical.  If you liked the Space Spoof at the end of Season 3, then you're in luck because Season 4 ends with a Titanic spoof.

Do yourself a favor and own one of the most original, well cast, masterfully written shows to ever air on television.  NewsRadio is a must own!",1147996800,9,604,4.486238532110092
2559664,5,B000FBH3WW,"The 1990s were a notoriously bad decade for sitcoms. Hundreds of Seinfeld- and Wayans-wannabes flooded the airwaves and, in general, aside from Seinfeld and Sports Night, few had any originality or staying power. NewsRadio is a glorious exception, a bright and occasionally very biting comedy about the workplace which is kindred to Mary Tyler Moore and Newhart more so than to Just Shoot Me. NewsRadio's laughs came from brilliant observations, recurring gags, well-defined characters and logical but wacky plotlines. It was close in vein to Seinfeld's unsentimentality, but far more vicious: one example is in season 3's Daydream episode, for those who saw it, has all the characters experiencing revealing daydreams. It features a vendor whose dream is to be one of the ""gang"" at WNYX, but as it turns out is hardly known and barely tolerated. NewsRadio invests more in its characters than do most dramas, and never settles for the half-assed laugh-track banality of its contemporaries. This is why it developed such a following, even if it was a very small percentage of the population.

The fourth season of NewsRadio is once again a triumph. With every season, the show kept building upon itself and getting better. There were notable guest appearances: Jon Lovitz has another guest appearance, this time as a suicide jumper exactly one year before joining the cast. Additionally, a pre-Gilmore Girls Lauren Graham begins a stint in this season as an efficiency expert. There were some departures as well: first, Khandi Alexander left the show, despite the fact that her initially poorly-written character had improved a great deal; and, of course, Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife after this season. The knowledge of this invariably tints the experience of watching this season. Nevertheless, these episodes show Hartman at his imperious best: taking over the office (in Who's the Boss?), getting a butler (in The Secret of Management), and becoming a Bob Roberts-type performer (in The Public Domain). Other highlights: Matthew (Andy Dick) gets fired, Dave (Dave Foley) and Lisa (Maura Tierney) split again and then switch jobs, and then switch again. This doesn't stop Lisa from trying to pick the brain of the station's owner, Mr. James (Stephen Root), with hilarious results. I could go on, but ultimately, this is a sitcom that is better enjoyed the less you know going in. Even so, it rewards multiple viewings, which is surprising since many sitcoms don't even reward single viewings. With the release of this show on DVD, it will likely become more popular than ever, and hopefully take its rightful place in the pantheon of great comedy.",1146355200,60,2658,5.124423963133641
2559665,5,B000FBH3WW,"This season is one of the best I've ever seen. I've started watching the show on a regular basis starting with this season premiere's episode, ""Jumper"". It's sad to also see that this was the last season for Catherine Duke (Khandi Alexander) and at the end of the season Bill McNeill (Phil Hartman) died. However, I really like this season and hopefully it will include some featurette on the 4th season and the 5th season, the reflection on Bill McNeill's life (Phil Hartman) of course.",1145232000,15,487,4.741176470588235

amazing actor, comedian & allround good guy who met a tragic end.

2559696,5,B000FBH3WW,"This was Phil Hartman's last season with Newsradio before he was murdered by his own wife, Brynn, who later committed suicide. Phil Hartman was perhaps one of the most talented comedians ever and well-remembered for his impersonations on Saturday Night Live. He was truly a gifted comic and actor. I still sorely miss Phil Hartman more than 17 years later. His tragic death was a great loss to everybody in the entertainment industry and to his fans. He was finally awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame posthumously for television.

The fourth season featured the cast in memorable episodes like the Titanic episode; Phil's Bill adopting a baby; Jimmy James in the balloon; and others. This season begins with Andy Dick's character, Matthew, fired from the radio show and the efficiency expert (played by Lauren Graham) in a few episodes. The cast was always first rate and worked as an ensemble with Phil leading the way. Everybody in the cast was able to shine. Kandi Alexander left the show midseason but they send her off on a high note. She returned for Bill's funeral in the next season. Vicki Lewis was a Broadway musical actress before she came on Newsradio. I always thought she and Kathy Griffin (who was playing Vicki on Suddenly Susan) could have played sisters. The other cast members include Maura Tierney,Stephen Root, Dave Foley, and Joe Rogan who rounded up the cast.

Newsradio never recovered from the loss of Phil Hartman. His friend and former Saturday Night Live co-star Jon Lovitz joined the series. Lovitz also appears in the fourth season opener as the man on the ledge. You can see how Hartman and Lovitz got along in the gag reels. The show would sadly end eventually. This three DVD disc set displayed great comedy with an ensemble cast as an AM Radio station in New York City with an eccentric billionaire Jimmy James and his eccentric group lead by level headed Dave.

Through all of it, I laughed and I wanted to cry because I still miss Phil Hartman after all these years. If he had lived, he would have been a bigger star. I only wished this DVD featured a tribute to the late great Phil Hartman though but I still enjoyed the season and miss watching it in syndication.",1426809600,2,2211,4.693298969072165

You can see his wife that killed him after the show went on break before season 5.  Sad.  Great show, good quality DVD and there are better extras on this one.

2559716,5,B000FBH3WW,"It is satisfying to read about the ""Newsradio"" fourth season, and to see many of one's hunches confirmed. The third season, which I really believed was better than the first two, was the lowest rated season of its five season run, and one can see in season 4 exactly the kind of changes, giving things I found missing in previous seasons. The most obvious is the addition of two to four episode arcs in the plot. The first was when an efficiency expert had Matthew (Andy Dick) fired to eliminate wasteful expenses. The second arc was when Lisa (Maura Tierney) replaced Dave (Dave Foley) as News Director. It may not be surprising if none of these arcs worked very well, since they were done at the urging of the network, against the wishes of the principle writers. None came even within shouting distance of the great arc in the relationship between Diane and Sam on ""Cheers"", which had us going for the better part of two seasons, with enough bumps in the road to make the genuine attraction between the two that much more engaging. I suggest the writers knew what they were doing, since the most memorable episodes were ""standalone"", such as episode 17 ""Balloon"" and ""President"", episode 1 of season 3, both highlighting Jimmy James (Stephen Root). The last episode, of which I will avoid giving away any spoilers, was possibly a classic example of what has been described as ""jumping the shark"", where a series is in trouble, and it tries something gimmicky to recoup viewers. One thing from which the show did not recover is the loss of Khandi Alexander, about a third of the way through the season. She never played a big role, but her character was a great contrast to the assortment of misfits and inept managers. That loss removed the basis for about four or five good lines per episode.

Unlike some other reviewers, I believe the show was very good, but not great, in the same class as other ensemble cast comedies such as ""Taxi"", ""Cheers"", ""Frazier"", ""Seinfeld"", and ""Friends"". It seems as if it delivered all it best stuff early, and it never made good use of the characters of Joe, Beth, and Catherine. But then, its differences are what make it so much fun to watch, especially with the relatively low price of the complete season sets.",1345852800,2,2251,4.655778894472362

Of course, I would recommend that you start at the very beginning and watch the first 3 seasons before this one--but it's really a very simple show to follow.  And what a great cast--Dave Foley, Andy Dick, Maura Tierney (who needs to return to TV sitcom land after she finishes all of her drama on ER), the late Phil Hartman and Vicki Lewis! They're all wonderful.  My favorite episodes of the 4th season: ""Super Karate Monkey Death Car"", in which a translation of Jimmy's book makes him a celebrity in Japan; ""French Diplomacy"", in which Matthew reopens his dormant dental practice; ""Catherine Moves On"", in which Catherine resigns and, unfortunately, the terrific Khandi Alexander leaves the show; ""Security Door"", in which a security door is installed; ""Big Brother"", in which Matthew gets a big brother; ""Beep, Beep"", in which Matthew tools around the office in a toy car (hysterical); ""Balloon"", in which Jimmy's round-the-world balloon flight is discovered to be a hoax; and ""Copy Machine"", in which a copy machine causes an employee's death.  As for DVD extras, there's a gag reel, a bizarre short film and cast/crew commentaries (which are fun and interesting to listen to).  I highly recommend this show and this DVD.  Buy it right now!

I remember watching most of these episodes when they were originally aired, but to now re-watch them in sequential order back-to-back is sublime!  If you are a fan of comedy, and loved the previous seasons of this show, then you definitely need to purchase this set!!!  If this is your first season, then there is no better time to start, but make sure you buy all the past and future seasons that are issued.  I hope you enjoy this show as much as I do!",1171929600,,552,4.382352941176471

2559743,5,B000FBH3WW,"It seems like the older I get, the more I long for a smart comedy that might not actually apply to my life, but works with my intellect.  Who can't laugh at Jimmy James when he reads from his book ""Jimmy James, corporate donkey wrestler"",  that was translated from English to Japanese, and back into English? Andy Dick, who wasn't heard of before Newsradio and has committed comedic suicide since, has never been more hilarious.  I highly recommend this smart comedy for those who consider themselves to be. And don't forget ""soon long black car will park in your parking space...war war war.""",1170806400,2,593,4.737864077669903

2559745,5,B000FBH3WW,"NewsRadio - The Complete Fourth Season is hysterical!  Phil Hartman is classic in his role as Bill.  The season highlights include Lisa's date with Matthew, Lisa  becoming the boss instead of Dave, and a wrestling match between Joe and Matthew.  All funny stuff.  Fun to watch even with your family!",1169251200,,299,4.9
