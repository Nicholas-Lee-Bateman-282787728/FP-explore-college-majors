7999291,4,B0000CG8AX,"Please note, all 4 other reviews currently up are for the wrong film!  This ""Stray Dog"" is an excellent documentary by Debra Granik (Winter's Bone) about a motorcycle riding Vietnam Vet who - under his VERY tough exterior - spends his time helping others and trying to be at peace in the world and with his own demons.  Very frustrating that this very touching documentary, which 1st aired on PBS has a bad rating from a different movie!",1507248000,,437,4.589743589743589
7999292,3,B0000CG8AX,"""Stray Dog"" is a live action drama film about a lonely ex-soldier who is trying to find out where his commander went after his squadron was disbanded and broken up years earlier.  This film was made by Mamiru Oshii, who is best known for his anime movies like ""Ghost in the shell"" and ""Patlabor"", but make no mistake, this movie is nothing like his anime films.  Although this film might look and sound like an action movie, it's not at all.  The only ""action"" sequence in the film happens at the very end and it's decent at best.  Instead, this movie focuses more on its atmosphere and setting and IS EXTREAMLY SLOW PACED.  Most of the movie is just the two main characters walking around with not much actuall plot happening.  In this sense, most people will probobly find this movie to be rather boring, but there are some good things this movie has going for it.  The cinematography is excellent with some beautiful city and landscape shots.  Almost every shot in this film looks as though they were carefully set up and planned out with a great attention to detail.  So it's defiantly a beautiful film if nothing else and is very well directed.  That said, I did feel like a lot could have been cut out.  In terms of actuall plot, this movie grinds to halt at times with very little if anything relevant happening.  Towards the end of the film, it does get a little more interesting when the main protagonist puts on his protect armor(which is basically a full bullet proof suit of armor) and guns down a bunch of government agents in an old hotel.  It's defiantly the most entertaining part of the film, and the design of the protect armor is pretty cool.  Over all, if you can get over how slow paced this movie is and love excellent and beautifully shot cinematography(and I mean REALLY love it) then mabie this movie might be worth checking out. If you want to watch a fast paced action film, then stay clear of this movie.  If you like the idea of this movie but want to watch a more entertaining film, then I highly recommend checking out the film ""Jin Roh, the wolf brigade"", which was actually directed by the same guy who made this film and is far more entertaining in my opinion.",1468540800,,2194,4.477386934673367
7999293,1,B0000CG8AX,"This movie is summed up in one word. Boring. They make you think at the beginning there will be action, with all the Panzer cops in some dilapidated building. All they do is with there, or lean against the wall. then this guys just spends most of the whole movie doing senseless stupidity. They are trying to be an ""art film"" with emotional tension, but it looks like some kid took his video camera around and followed two people as they wander aimlessly. If we are to be bored to death, at least the guy could have sex with the woman, but even this does not happen. If you made the same mistake and bought this hoping for an action movie, there is finally meagre action with 25 minutes to go, in the form of a laughably bad (obviously fake) kung fu fight. We FINALLY see the panzer armour with 20 minutes to go, at 1 hour 15 minutes in. He has and MG42 and with this, fights a bunch of guys with painted clown faces. Even the battle at the end is drawn out and they try to make it have ""drama"". i think the director was hoping to emulate a John Woo film, with balletic violence at the end. It just does not work. even the battle at the end is fake looking. While the outfit is cool, they spend too much time having the viewer ""admire"" the Panzer cop armour and things move too slowly, even during the final battle. They throw is a little more stupidity with a wandering scene in the middle of the battle - in case an hour and 15 minutes of it was not enough. After the guys dies, they throw in 5 more minutes of random scenery. Even one star is too high praise for this piece of garbage portrayed as a film",1335139200,3,1607,4.153846153846154
7999294,3,B0000CG8AX,"Straw Dog is unlike any movie that I have seen. Like many people, I expected an intense action film after seeing ""Jim Roh"", Mamoru Oshi's animated masterpiece but the bulk of ""Straw Dogs"" is a beautiful, poetic mediation on trust and betrayal with plenty of sublime imagery. At first, I was put off by the main character Ishi seemingly directionless journey in China to find his former master from the Capital Police (the heavily armored Kerberos who were disbanded 3 years before).

With action at both ends of the film, the middle can seem boring unless you transcend the action movie expectations. It's full of serene sea-side beauty and some interesting shots of a Chinese village. There is some great action and violence at the end that's a bit confusing as to who Ishi's adversaries are but it's worth the wait.",1231977600,5,817,4.794326241134752
7999295,2,B0000CG8AX,"Mamoru Oshii has put out pretty impressive videos, this is not one of them.

The main character pursues his old master (like a Stray Dog.. ) who left his unit behind. Throughout the entire movie all he does is walk down streets (they even walk the same streets over pointlessly ) , occasionally bumping into a guy that feels life can be summed up in his ""Stray Dog philosophy"", then eating, then walking around some more. All the while a horrible piano tune plays.

Don't let the cover fool you, there really isn't many kerberos panzer cops in this movie. It's not until the very end does the main character put on his nifty leather armor and mow through baddies, which was about the only exciting part of the movie (no cheesy piano music either!).

Not much of a plot, predictable, and boring. If you're interested in Mamoru's live action movies Avalon is better. If you absolutely have to have something with kerberos cops in it try Jin-Roh The Wolf Brigade.",1100044800,14,960,4.60233918128655
