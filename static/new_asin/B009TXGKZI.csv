8544380,5,B009TXGKZI,"I used these videos on Netflix until they were removed. I was totally bummed since I just had a baby and wanted to work out again with something I was comfortable doing. I recently found them at Target for $14.99!!!
Ellen is a great trainer. She continually reminds you to hold your posture, which makes her work out most effective. The moves aren't difficult either. She starts every new move slowly. I hate videos that make you feel like you can't keep up or have complicated moves that just make me mad....",1362528000,8,509,4.543478260869565
