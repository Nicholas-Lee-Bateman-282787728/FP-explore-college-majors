4886348,5,B005SQRYE6,After finishing up season 1 I couldn't wait to get my hands on 2. Especially after all the bad quality bootlegs that have been floating around throughout the years.

I can't wait for Season 3.",1328572800,2,345,4.276923076923077
4886350,5,B005SQRYE6,"I was really excited to see this available and had to pick it up.  For someone in their 20's growing up on old school Nickelodeon; it becomes difficult to remember the shows from over a decade ago.  Releasing them on DVD like this helps to remember the programs from your childhood.  I loved this show when it was on TV and love it even more that it's available on DVD to watch and relive.

4886384,5,B005SQRYE6,"One of my favorite shows ever! I discovered the show when I was looking through the internet looking at different early Nick shows. Hey Dude was one of the only ones who really stood out to me. The show is a comedy, but also teaches life lessons. The setting is on a Dude Ranch where teenagers work and live for the summer. Mr. Earnest owns the ranch and has a son named Buddy. They get in many scrapes and scrabbles, but always manage to get out of them comically. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys comedies. Though I'm sure anyone could enjoy the show!",1420070400,,569,4.327102803738318

8485352,5,B005SQRYE6,"If you grew up in the 80s, Nickelodeon was part of your everyday life.  Even I, who didn't watch a lot of TV growing up, knew about some of their shows.  And one I always enjoyed if I caught it was Hey Dude.  Watching season two on DVD has reminded me just why.

The show is set on the Bar None Dude Ranch and follows the misadventures of the teenage staff.  Theres senior staff member (and most likely to goof off) Ted (David Lascher), Native American Danny (Joe Torres), horse riding instructor Brad (Kelly Brown), and life guard Melody (Christine Taylor).  Overseeing all of them is ranch hand Lucy (Debrah Kalman) and the owner Benjamin Ernst (David Brisbin).  Rounding out the cast is Buddy (Josh Tygiel), Mr. E.s son.

The thirteen episodes here are rather typical of the series, which was a single camera comedy before the current craze in the genre took off.  There are some battle of the sexes stories, most noticeably when the guys and girls try to decide how to spend a $100 tip that was left.  Melody gets a chance to train for the Olympic swim team.  Danny deals with making a huge mistake.  After Ted tells a ghost story that scares the rest of the teens, they try to get him back.  A bank robber crash lands on ranch property.  And Mr. E. decides to sell the ranch, but the reason just might surprise you.

While the setting is a guest ranch, most of the storylines are relatable to kids, so that helps explain the popularity then and the fond memories now.  Plus the characters are great.  You feel like they are real and cant help but like all of them, even Ted whose ego could always be knocked down a peg or two.  The comedy comes from the characters and situations, although occasionally they really do go overboard and descend into farce.  Really, the best example of that is the final episode on this set, which features a panic as the gang things aliens have landed near the ranch.

The exception to that is Mr. E.  Hes almost always over the top with some new scheme that is crazy.  Hes not a good example of a responsible adult (weve got Lucy for that), although when he does need to get serious with the kids, he does.  Even so, they do respect him as an authority even if they don't always respect his ideas.

The show does scream 80s.  Its most noticeable in the clothes and hair styles.  But why wouldnt it?  These particular episodes were all released in 1989.

It was also low budget, which is noticeable at times in the production.  No, I don't spot mikes or anything like that, but the sound level can often be uneven, especially on the outdoor scenes.

The acting, too, isn't always the best.  It does seem like the actors have settled a bit more into their roles, although Christine Taylor continues to be the shining star in the acting department, and this is coming from the guy who had a crush on the beautiful Kelly Brown.  The acting is good enough to allow you to enjoy the episodes, so thats all that really matters.

The thirteen episodes included here are on two discs.  Theyre presented in their native full frame picture and stereo sound.  Andthats it.  Unlike season one, which included a short interview with Christine Taylor, this season has nothing in the way of bonus features.

Hey Dude is probably best viewed through the lens of nostalgia, but those who remember the show will have a blast revisiting the characters in season two.",1432598400,,3384,4.497536945812808
8485353,5,B005SQRYE6,"I enjoyed watching this as a kid, so happy to watch it through my amazon prime. Funny, entertaining and a clean kids show, which they made more shows like these.",1431043200,,161,4.4
8485354,4,B005SQRYE6,Great show. I loved watching this as a kid,1428969600,,42,3.7777777777777777
