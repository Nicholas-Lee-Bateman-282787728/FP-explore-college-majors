8199692,5,B000R9U34M,I saw this documentary on PBS around 2002 and immediately started traveling to NY from Boston to see the shows. All of them.  I was never disappointed; the Amato was everything I had expected and more. All of us who loved the Amato opera really miss it since it closed in 2009; with Tony Amato's death at 91  in 2012 the final chapter has closed. But we have our memories. Do not miss out on this documentary -- and by all means buy Tony's autobiography. I am so grateful he completed it before his death.,1432771200,2,505,4.3052631578947365
8199693,5,B000R9U34M,A beautiful record of the surely unique Amatos and the pleasure they had in what they did and the pleasure they gave to so many with their enthusiasm for the music and people and each other.  I wish we could go there once more.,1400457600,2,227,4.159090909090909
8199694,5,B000R9U34M,"ENRICH YOUR LIFE.  Infect yourself with love for opera by watching this story.  Spend some time with two people who obviously lived their lives absolutely loving what they were doing. It's catching.  You'll smile all the way through the experience, and will want to go out and experience a live local opera production.",1375056000,3,318,4.962264150943396
8199695,5,B000R9U34M,"Great love story, great achievement, memories of my younger years when I tried to make it in the world of Opera. I did sing on the stage of Amato Opera House the lead role on the Opera Rigoletto by Verdi back in 1967. Tony and Sally were  wonderful people to know and work with. God bless them!",1372982400,3,294,4.157894736842105
8199696,5,B000R9U34M,"I loved this documentary.  A friend had told me about it, having seen it on PBS.  I wasn't able to get it through Netflix, so I bought a copy hoping that I would like it.  Good call.  Having grown up in a community theater, it was like coming home watching this small but dedicated troupe creating magic out of mops for wigs and whatever else is at hand.  The passion, energy and dedication of the Amatos is truly inspiring and their love for each other is deeply moving.

I've passed the Amato Opera House many times when I visit friends in NYC, but I've never attended a performance.  Now I can't wait to see an opera there.  I only regret missing the opportunity of having Sally Amato greet me and give me my tickets.",1183420800,8,720,4.32089552238806
