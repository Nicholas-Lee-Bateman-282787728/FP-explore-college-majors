3964505,4,B000W93Y2K,"Such a reminder of how things used to be. Silent, B/W, Captions. Enjoyed it immensely",1479513600,,85,4.733333333333333

3964507,3,B000W93Y2K,"I was curious to see what a silent film could possibly do with a play by Oscar Wilde.  This film is really a curiosity in itself.  Because what Oscar has most to offer is his wit...and how can a silent film render that quality?  The answer is that it cannot.  What comes through is the sheer melodrama of the plot, which is interesting in itself.  I would recommend this silent version only to people who are, like myself, fanatically attached to Oscar Wilde, and who want to see his work in all its versions and ramifications.",1373500800,3,527,4.447916666666667
3964508,2,B000W93Y2K,"We have here a privately-manufactured DVD. My experience with barebones DVD-Rs has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

As a silent photoplay, Oscar Wilde's 1892 stage drama is slow-moving, practically static (actors sometimes hold still like they're posing for a daguerrotype. I cannot understand why Ernst Lubitsch's picture is so highly regarded. (It includes the director's trademark highly placed knobs on overtall doors.) Categorized as a comedy, I found not a thing amusing about it. (Note: At 89 minutes, it's short a half-hour of the original running time. Maybe the amusing parts got edited out?)

Supposedly a slam on the upper class, ""Fan"" concerns a young lady married to a bluebood some years her senior. When a middle-aged woman sends Lord Windermere a letter that she must see him, the wife gets suspicious. This visitor, Mrs Erlynne, reveals to the lord that she is his wife's mother, that she gave the girl up for adoption in infancy. Erlynne asks for Windermere's help in introducing her to society so she too can marry a blueblood.

The (ahem) ""funny"" element is that, convinced hubby is having an affair, Lady W. takes up with a different lord who's been after her for some time.

3964509,1,B000W93Y2K,"I bought this copy of Lady Windermere's Fan from Synergy on DVD and I was very upset to learn that it is an edited version of the original Lubitsch film. If you are interested in getting the real version of this film, buy More Treasures from American Film Archives 1894-1931. It costs a lot more than this version, but it's the real untruncated version, and the musical score is much better.",1317686400,21,391,4.52112676056338
3964510,1,B000W93Y2K,"I have seen this film, almost a masterpiece, years ago in the Madrid Filmoteca, and I have just bought this DVD, released by the studio SYNERGY (???). It is a very truncated and damaged edition. How do they dare to release such awful thing? DONT'BUY IT!",1260230400,26,253,4.521739130434782
3964511,1,B000W93Y2K,"In agreement with majority of member viewers - bad acting - terrible sound, etc. etc.  not worth any more of my time.",1522108800,2,117,4.318181818181818
3964512,1,B000W93Y2K,"Terrible acting, even worse attempts at the right accent. Didn't last more than a few minutes of watching.",1522022400,2,106,4.944444444444445

$20,000. Watched first 5 monutes then ditched it.",1520208000,4,138,6.2631578947368425
3964516,3,B000W93Y2K,"Some of the reviews seem to be describing a different item.  This is not a silent film.  It has dialogue, although the dialogue is a bit awkwardly paced.  It seems like a low budget production.  The camera shots are static, and most of the characters are shown from the waist up.  The costumes look cheap.  I don't think I can finish this train wreck.  The story is an interesting one, and one that I would enjoy seeing as a film...but not this film.",1520121600,4,450,4.349397590361446

3964518,5,B000W93Y2K,"A very entertaining indie film adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play.  Funny and heart-warming.  I particularly liked the score (mostly string arrangements for chamber-music groups) and Julia Farino, who played Mrs. Erlynne.",1517961600,,221,5.875

8376937,5,B000W93Y2K,I really enjoyed seeing this version of Oscar Wilde's story. I was so engaged in the film it's hard to believe it stood the test of the time and is mesmerizing.,1524268800,,160,4.193548387096774
8376938,5,B000W93Y2K,"Such a moving story! I loved the restraint of the actors--it's easy for Oscar Wilde's lines to be overplayed in an attempt to ""help"" the audience ""get"" them, but they trusted us here, and I appreciated it.",1523923200,,205,4.5675675675675675
8376939,4,B000W93Y2K,clearly a play... well done.,1523664000,,28,4.8
8376940,3,B000W93Y2K,"AMAZON FIRE STICK listed the production with Ronald Colman et al and this is a theatre production  made in California? While, the actors are reading their lines, I am not sure that they are feeling it.  Meaning, the anxious idle-gossip that the ladies, were spreading about Lord Windemere,. which caused quite a stir among the idle-rich.  I can logically relate the time period was cause for women to faint at the thought of one's husband being entertained at the home of an unmarried women.  I can explain to you that I suspected the real reason Lord W was seen at the house of this women early on in the play. I think this is a put my fan in front of my mouth as I yawn moment.",1523577600,,679,4.322834645669292

8376942,1,B000W93Y2K,"Wow, I didn't think it possible to be so bad but I thought I was at a badly practiced school play with this one.",1523145600,,112,3.7083333333333335
8376943,1,B000W93Y2K,"I am a huge fan of Oscar Wilde and this adaptation is really terrible, and has quite possibly the worst English accents ever!!! Lady Windermere starts off a sentence in a British accent and finishes it off, in an American accent. Who on earth designed those awful costumes? ruffles on a waistcoat do not a costume make!! Nothing tops the wooden acting though, it was like watching an 8th grade school production. By all means watch it for free on prime, but you have only yourself to blame if you buy the dvd.",1523059200,,509,4.483870967741935
8376944,1,B000W93Y2K,A  high-school production would be better. Were these actor's paid?,1522713600,,67,5.7

8376946,1,B000W93Y2K,"Terrible, just terrible! Fake British accents, actors sound like they are reading from cue cards. I could only tolerate 10 minutes. Just awful.",1522195200,5,143,5.260869565217392
