7725685,5,B01DX0ND2K,"In 1961, FCC Chairman Newton Minow delivered a blistering address to broadcasters where he called television a ""vast wasteland"".  At one point in his address he said: ""Is there one person in this room who claims that broadcasting can't do better?  Is there one network president in this room who claims he can't do better?  Why is so much of television so bad? . . . We need imagination in programming, not sterility; creativity, not imitation; experimentation, not conformity; excellence, not mediocrity.""  Perhaps in the wake of that broadside to the television industry, networks were more willing to respond to the challenge.

The following season CBS debuted ""The Defenders"".  Henry Castleman and Walter J. Podrazik in their excellent book ""Watching TV: Eight Decades of American Television"" wrote about the show: ""The trial process became a full-scale debate presenting both the pro and con arguments through [E.G.] Marshall, [Robert] Reed, and the supporting characters and guest stars as they planned the best ways to handle the legal strategy.  Through all the topical discussions, however, the program still maintained the basics of good drama with strong characters and entertaining scripts.  'The Defenders' was the first TV series to examine the effects and implications of entertainment blacklisting [in an episode featuring guest star Jack Klugman], ... while another installment 'The Benefactor,' dealt openly with abortion, then illegal and barely acknowledged.  This episode, in which a doctor spoke out in favor of the practice, caused a public controversy in which eleven of the 180 stations that normally carried the program, as well as the regular sponsor, pulled out for that week.  Despite such a daring (yet generally evenhanded) approach to important issues, 'The Defenders' was an immediate ratings winner for CBS.  Throughout its four-year run it maintained high standards of production quality while attracting a large and faithful audience that did not seem to mind 'serious drama' on a weekly basis.""

I want to publicly thank ""Shout"" for committing to release the first season of what I hope will be the entire run of the show.  Not only is ""The Defenders"" a tremendously important show in the history of television, but I'm excited to see how the show holds up all these years later, having largely not been seen by audiences due to lack of syndication.  The show's multiple Emmy nominations and wins back in the 1960s, bodes well for 21st-century audiences to discover a neglected, but dynamic gem.  I hope you will join me in ordering the show and supporting it.

7725686,5,B01DX0ND2K,"I am stunned.  Shout! has announced that The Defenders (CBS-TV, 1961-65) Season 1 will be released this July.  All 32 premier season episodes, featuring E.G Marshall and Robert Reed as the Preston father and son defense team, will be included in this reasonably priced set.  The Defenders was nominated for 22 (!) Emmy Awards during it's run, winning best dramatic program in its first three seasons.

First season guest stars, and I assure you I am not kidding, include: Jack Klugman, Gene Hackman, William Shatner, Kermit Murdock, Clu Gulager, Harry Towns, Fritz Weaver, Godfrey Cambridge, Sam Wanamaker, Frank Gorshin, Pat Hingle, Marian Seldes, Simon Oakland, Joan Hackett, Ed Binns, Alfred Ryder, Robert Duvall, Robert Loggia, Martin Sheen, J.D.

Please place an order for this Reginald Rose (12 Angry Men) masterpiece.  If sales are strong, then possibly all four seasons will be released.  Once I receive my copy, I will return with a review of the set's aesthetics.  Thank you for taking the time to read my initial posting.

***UPDATE****

I just received my copy of the first season of The Defenders and I am delighted with the set.  The first episode, ""Quality of Mercy,"" featuring Jack Klugman, Gene Hackman and Philip Abbott is magnificent!  Aside from the outstanding script and direction (Buzz Kulik), sound and picture quality is quite good.  The opening shot of Robert Reed and E.G. Marshall greeting each other is somewhat dark and there are occasional flecks, but I am thrilled to finally be able to view this outstanding drama once again.  Also, there are a handful of extras: a CUNY-TV interview with E.G., a discussion of the series with writer Larry Cohen (The Invaders and Branded), an extended episode of the pilot episode with Clu Gulager (obviously a dub from VHS tape) and the Studio One presentation of The Defender with Ralph Bellamy, William Shatner and Steve McQueen.

Thank you Shout! for making this remarkable series available!",1459987200,71,2301,5.2146739130434785

So far, every episode was outstanding except for one that I did not care too much for (Gideons Follies).  I am not a lawyer but the show is well written and thought provoking.  Frankly, I can't really tell that the stories are dated.  This is better than a lot of stuff on TV now.  This has very easily become one of my top 5 TV series of all time.  It would be a real shame if other seasons don't get released.  if you are into classic television show, purchase this.  Trust me.",1505692800,,571,4.118181818181818

7725691,5,B01DX0ND2K,Very good show. Some episodes must have been very controversial for the times since they still can strike a nerve even today.

7725692,5,B01DX0ND2K,"Received this as a gift because I loved this series in the 1960's.  It made me want to be a lawyer because I thought lawyers fought for the truth and what was fair and right.  This is still timely now, though some differences in laws and customs, and some terminology, too, from then.  Even as a child, I preferred it immensely to Perry Mason, which seemed to repeat the same basic plot.  Much of the time, life isn't as simple as that. And many of the problems still exist even if there have been some changes in awareness and laws.  Also interesting as an historical view of America, a kind of time capsule.
And there are various single-episode roles played by actors who became well-known later.
Please, when will Season 2 be available??  And Seasons 3 and 4?",1503532800,2,762,4.4855072463768115

I just checked!), and two of those were me begging Shout Factory to bring out the rest of the seasons of Leave It To Beaver. And they did. Now it looks like I'll have to do it again: Shout Factory, please bring out the remaining seasons of The Defenders!

Shout has done a superlative job with Season 1. What a great show! My wife and my college-aged son watch it with me. We all love it. The quality of the show itself and of the DVD production is similar to that of The Fugitive (the 1960s series with David Janssen). My son watched every one of those 4 seasons with me as well. The acting and writing quality of both shows is superb.

I wrote to Shout, and they promptly and courteously responded--but there appear to be no plans at present to produce the remaining seasons! The whole series does exist somewhere; the University of Wisconsin's Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research apparently has it. But who owns the rights? How can we get this old masterpiece in print? Without naming some of the mediocre 70s and 80s TV shows that now have complete boxed sets--surely this classic deserves the same honor of having a boxed set?",1496102400,2,1212,4.454954954954955

But seriously, every cast member is outstanding. Totally classic tv here. It doesn't get any better. Im starting to think now why Robert Reed didn't like brady bunch that much now...with a superb shows like the Defenders you want to do even better material...not slapstick comedy...now i understand his frustration.

It turns out the picture quality is a little sub par however, in my case, I found I was able to eke out better quality by changing my plasma TV picture settings from MOVIE to STANDARD, the increase in contrast really helps.

I thought the immortal program The Defenders was a lost treasure that would never be seen again, and so was thrilled when the first season DVD was released.  Shortly, I'll be teaching my law and popular culture class to a group of Stanford freshmen. In the first class session, I'll show the the students the famous Defenders episode ""The Benefactor"" on disk 8 of the first season DVD.  Lawrence and Robert Preston defend a physician who performed illegal abortions and wants to use his trial as the platform for legalization of the procedure.  All of the sponsors withdrew and CBS courageously presented the episode anyway.  (The events surrounding ""The Benefactor""  later became the subject of an episode of Mad Men).  I expect the Defenders episode will trigger a vigorous class discussion about the world of abortion before Roe v. Wade was decided (as well as a discussion of what television was like in the 1960s).  Every one of the episodes on the first season DVD concerns some controversial  issue of legal procedure, legal ethics, or social policy, all seen through the prism of a small law firm.  Like The Benefactor, many of these story lines were way ahead of their time.  I hope every fan of legal shows on TV will rush out and purchase this DVD.  If you never saw the original show in the 1960s, you'll be amazed at the quality of the scripts, the great acting, the music, and the production values.  The Defenders may be the finest legal drama ever shown on TV,  The release of this DVD set  is a truly historic cultural event.

7725715,5,B01DX0ND2K,"""The Defenders"" was a standout in adult television drama in the early Sixties.  It still beats anything on the air today for its courageous tackling of compelling social issues such as drug addiction and abortion.  New York-based and written by Reginald Rose and some of the most talented script writers of the time, it was unflinching in its portrayal of real-life situations involving homicide, suicide, and even patricide.  Some of the finest actors and actresses guest starred in its episodes--among them William Shatner, Steve McQueen, Theresa Wright, Shirl Conway, and Murray Hamilton.  These dramas still resonate with truth and reality today.  Nothing before or since--with the exceptions of ""Studio One"" and ""The United States Steel Hour""--can touch these programs for consistent quality entertainment with enduring messages.  And for fans of ""Mad Men,"" here is the real thing: when people looked unfailingly well-groomed and actually dressed up as part of their day-to-day routines.  Unintentionally, these programs show what has been lost in American culture during the last 55 years.  Watch these programs to not only enjoy but also to learn.",1481328000,2,1154,5.407821229050279

7725721,5,B01DX0ND2K,"""The Defenders"" was a pivotal series: a bridge from television's golden age of live drama, represented by such anthologies as ""Studio One"" and ""Playhouse 90"" and drawing from that era's deep pool of talent to create tight, one-camera, filmed teleplays based in New York (not Hollywood). Herbert Brodkin, a producer with equal measures of intelligence, taste, and stubbornness, hired many of that era's finest writers (Reginald Rose, the series' creator; Peter Stone; David Shaw; Ernest Kinoy), directors (Franklin Schaffner, Daniel Petrie, Ralph Nelson, Buzz Kulik), and actors (an early '60s Who's Who of established stars and up-and-comers, most of whom were trained on the Broadway stage). For the viewer all this insures that the shows are never less than engaging. A few, in this freshman year, slip into melodrama or offbeat humor: the show was finding its footing and, of course, had to be sufficiently commercial to secure sponsorship in order to be broadcast. Most of this season's segments, however, qualify as legitimate drama; a few are gripping fifty-five years later. In format the episodes are three-act character studies; the pervasive theme is the practice of American law itselfits strength, miscarriage, flexibility, resilience, support of and conflict with morality. Occasionally trial lawyers employ smart tactics, only to have them backfire in their faces. Unlike ""Perry Mason""entertaining detective melodramas""The Defenders"" offers advocates who sometimes lose their cases yet win larger battlesor win the case in moral ambiguity. Like all well-told stories, there are often surprises, but they are organic to their characters' circumstances. The most celebrated and controversial of the series' offerings is included in this set: ""The Benefactor,"" a mature, heart-rending study of illegal medical abortions, produced twelve years before Roe v. Wade, which scared off all the program's regular sponsors and even today would have a tough time being aired on network television.

Disc Nine contains special features, including Reginald Rose's original teleplay, ""The Defender,"" for ""Studio One"" (1957) and interviews with series producer Bob Markell, writer Larry Cohen, and actor E. G. Marshall.

A few of the episodes have minor issues of video and audio reproduction, but Shout! has done a fine job of restoring materials from old elements.

Finally, the rock at this series' center and its moral core is the dramatic lead, E. G. Marshall. In the hands of a lesser actor, his role could have been a cardboard catalyst to grease exposition. Marshall personifies intelligence, dedication, wisdom, compassion, and rectitude. You wish there were still, or ever, attorneys of such integrity. Somewhere, perhaps, there are. If he is an idealized figure from JFK's socially conscious New Frontier, then it's an ideal for which one may hunger in such a greedy, vulgar, coarsened time as this.",1478304000,6,5509,5.592326139088729

I've watched the first 6 episodes so far and already I'm loving it even though I've heard it really starts sizzling around episode 20 or so.

My major prejudice in viewing older television is my awareness of how many restrictions are placed on the narrative. When you're used to a level of mature content, television from 50 years ago can feel staid or inert (or so my bias tells me). The Defenders is not that type of show. The show's willingness to confront morally complex cases made me quickly forget the form's limitations. Rather than being ""dated,"" I found the show's time period an essential part of what made it so engaging and vital. I hope releases like these are picked up by people my age (25+).

Because of the time frame in which it ran, it is far to often totally overlooked in articles about outstanding tv series.  While some tv dramas of the past 15 of 20 years have indeed been superb, the Defenders should never be overlooked.  The show's willingness to tackle controversial issues of its time was incredible.  It stretched the limits of conventional broadcasting in other ways.  In one episode, the opening ""set-up"" went for perhaps 12 minutes before the opening credits, a radical thing for its time.

The parade of guests stars is nothing short of jaw-dropping, and you can see the names listed elsewhere. Also of note, however, are the delightful surprise supporting (sometimes bit) players: James Earl Jones, Gene Wilder, Roscoe Lee Browne, Robert Walker, Jr., Ossie Davis... Veteran directors like John Brahm mix with up-and-comers like Franklin Schaffner, all under the watchful brilliance of Reginald Rose and Herbert Brodkin who seemed to have a take-no-prisoners attitude about quality control. The two leads are simply brilliant: E.G. Marshall is fast becoming my favorite actor, and his creation of ""Lawrence Preston"" my favorite TV protagonist. It's an intelligent, carefully measured performance that stands up beautifully today as an example of textbook naturalism. And if you only know Robert Reed from THE BRADY BUNCH you're in for a surprise; the father-son dynamic at play here is never in-your-face, but subtle, displaying genuine chemistry. Add subject matter that even fifty years later would be considered risky, and you have a release that everyone should know about, whether they're a fan of classic TV or not (frankly I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention as of yet).

I am amazed that they could put out such quality programmes week after week.  The Defenders is one of my all time favourite TV on DVD releases.  The cases are more varied than Perry Mason  and  don't always turn out quite how you expect them to.  E.G. Marshall and Robert Reed are excellent.

Through various forums and television trivia  sites, i was aware of the reputation this series had.

When Shout made the announcement, I immediately pre-ordered.  I was so excited when the package showed up.  Inervously placed the first disc in the player and was transfixed during the first episode, ""Quality of Mercy"".  I was surprised that a question of medical ethics was played out for viewers in the fall of 1961.  Seems like ""ripped from the headlines"" belongs here and not to Law&Order.  Such a compelling premiere episode.

Subsequent episodes seem to try different scenarios, even having Perry Mason - like courtroom confessions.  Overall though, I am very happy I am finally seeing this ""Quality"" show.  For the most part, the stories are just as compelling today

As an attorney I was impressed by the accuracy and realism in and outside the courtroom. The writing, acting and plot lines are exceptional. While the program is very entertaining, each episode forces you think, something which is sorely missing from much(There is still quality programming today as well)of today's television. The cast of non cat actors is amazing. In one of the early episodes Jack Klugman plays a prosecutor, who initially seems like a bully until his true humanity is demonstrated. Gene Hackman had a lesser role in the same episode. The story lines reflect not only reality as evidenced by the recognition that the world and the issues addressed are gray at best and rarely black and white. The topics raised tested the limits of programming at the time. As a small sample they included black listing, mercy killing and abortion. The list of weekly guest stars was exceptional. Considering this was broadcast in the early to mid 1960's in black and white, Shout did a fine job in the audio and video production. Only the opening scene of the pilot had some lines, but even that was not distracting. I commend Shoutfor finally releasing the show and hope it will release the entire series in short order. I will buy more than one copy of it to share with friends. For many decades I waited for its final release as I did with Naked City. The two shows annually competed for the Emmy and deservedly so. there were extras including the prequel with Ralph Bellamy and a very young William Shattner as well as an interview with the writer and Marshall.

What remains in my mind is the two part anti-capitalist episode as well as the one foreshadowing the Robert Redford film THE CANDIDATE when Lawrence Preston attempts a run for political office and realizes how much of a sham the whole process is.

(Only the pilot has sound and picture quality issues while the TV series is in rather good shape considering the age of the show.)  While some viewers find fault with some of the problems that were treated during the show I have to disagree.
