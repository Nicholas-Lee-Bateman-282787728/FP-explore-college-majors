3529671,5,B001DHE9KG,This is a lavish productuion worthy of The Met. Both Angela Georghiu and Ramon Vargas perform extremely well. The cafe scene especially was highly entertaining. Musetta gave of her best. The friends sang amusingly and playfully. Do not hesitate - you will enjoy.,1223424000,6,262,5.116279069767442
3529672,4,B001DHE9KG,"For my money, the star of this performance is Ramon Vargas. He can act with the kind of restraint Hamlet rightly recommends for all times to any players, and he is in glorious voice throughout. Angela Gheorghiu possesses an indisputably gorgeous voice, and her employment of middle and high registers here is beyond criticism. She seems, though, to have developed a mannerism, a gummy holding on to vowels in the final syllables of low notes at the end of phrases which are unnecessarily ugly rather than dramatic. Also, she tends to annoyingly overact. Her Mimi has more characterization than most, it's true, and her aggressiveness in going after her chubby Rodolfo, rather than portraying the usual passive-aggressive consumptive heroine is not the problem. What is problematic is her combining of disparates. At her entrance, she's already half dead. After a sip of wine, she's Sieglinde stumbled into Paris.  The conception, along with the silent-movie emoting, is sadly contradictory. She deserved a better stage director.

The conducting of this performance seems to my ears excessively slow, with the consequence that famous moments lack any memorableness. Like a bandmaster, the conductor bows to his singers rather than to Puccini's genius.

The rest of the cast is adequate, but hardly representative of the Met casting from strength. All in all, a good performance, but hardly a great or memorable one.",1222473600,17,1414,5.220264317180617
3529673,5,B001DHE9KG,"I believe I own a copy of every commercial CD recording of ""La Boheme,"" as well as several DVDs of live performances and this DVD is BY FAR my favorite.  I even saw the Zeffirelli production at the Met live with Gheorghiu and Alagna the afternoon after they got married, but even that did not move me as this did.  A performance that, after all this time and exposure to the opera, can leave me in tears is a rarity, and I was sobbing at the end of this video.

Every one of the six principals is magnificent, singing and acting gloriously.  At first, I was concerned that the extremely expansive tempi Maestro Luisotti employs would enervate the production.  But, while the tempo for ""Mi chiamano Mimi,"" combined with the close-ups in HD of Angela Gheorghiu performing in the gigantic Metropolitan Opera House, does elicit some silent movie actress-like facial expressions and gestures from her, on the whole, these tempi allow each of the singers to bring a greater variety of coloration to their tones than one usually hears, which in turn only enhances the dramatic impact.  For example, I usually find ""O Mimi tu piu non torni"" to be a pretty, but somewhat annoying, diversion before the drama of the final act commences.  BUt under Maestro Luisotti and with the beautiful and sensitive singing of Ramon Vargas and Ludovic Tezier, it becomes one of the most moving moments of the opera.  In fact, I was in tears throughout the final act.  Every characters emotions were heartfelt and never schmaltzy or overheated.

Also with respect to coloration, Ms. Gheorghiu produced some of the darkest tones I have ever heard in ""Donde lieta usci.""  While others have made this a pretty and nostalgic aria, Ms. Gheorghiu with subtlety rips out your heart just as Mimi's has been torn from her.

As I said, I saw this production with Ms. Gheorghiu and her brand new husband in the lead roles, but I didn't feel the love between Mimi and Rodolfo as I felt it between her and Mr Vargas.  His performance matched hers in its unique combination of subtlety and intensity.  And to top it all off, they both sang with some of the most beautiful lines and tones ever brought to this music.

For newcomers and aficionados alike, this DVD is an ESSENTIAL component of any opera lovers collection.",1222473600,45,2281,4.6959798994974875

3529679,5,B001DHE9KG,"This production of Puccini's La Bohme was truly moving and the production is good. The lead singers, Gal James (Mimi) and Aquiles Machado (Rodolfo), performed with passion, warmth and sensitivity, you won't be able to resist falling in love again. I say the production is just good because the producer tried to combine technology (large flat screens and projections) and the world of mid 19th century France, with a moving platform that soloists sometimes use for their solos which is a little distracting. The costumes are 19th century (thank God) but the sets are a little sparse with a combination of 19th century furniture and digital projections of paintings. It takes a little getting used to at first. Gal James is new to me and she portrays Mimi very well and her singing is suburb and velvety. Aquiles Machado is a young, cute/handsome and energetic Rodolfo with a superb light tenor voice that could melt anyone heart. Their performance moved me to tears many times. The supporting case is fine with a wonderful Musetta in Carmen Romeu. One cast member, Mattia Olivieri, did over act his part playing Schaunard. In the last scene, he seems way to overcome with emotion and tends to distract some attention away from the main characters. Chailly's conducting is full of passion and energy. The sound is superb  and well balanced between the orchestra, soloists and choirs. A negative for English audiences is the terribly translated subtitles in English. Also, the subtitles sometimes do not appear long enough to read the whole phrase. But the performance makes up for it in leaps and bounds. I, however, have to take off almost 1/2 star for the negatives that I mentioned above, but it still gets a 5 star rating from me because the performance from Gal James and Aquiles Machado is so superb and the rest of the cast and the conducting from Chailly is also superb. And the picture quality and sound are also superb. I highly recommend this performance of La Bohme. One can never have too many La Bohmes.",1444435200,,2016,4.826589595375722

3529683,4,B001DHE9KG,"Puccini Would Have Wept.
I have 6 DVD/BluRays of La Boheme. I have listened to many other CD recordings & have watched a number of its productions on youtube.
Although quite a number are excellent, this one is quickly becoming a favorite--overall!(EXCEPT: see caveat below)
Love the production: while quite modern with fantastic projections in an otherwise minimally decorated stage, it still is true to tradition. Costuming is contextually proper.
Aquiles Machado as Rodolfo is excellent & has improved over previous outings. Gal James, new to me, is a wonderful Mimi. Moreover, the chemistry between the two is very palpable  & adds much veracity to their roles.
Further, Massimo Cavalletti as Marcello & Carmen Romeu, Musetta also are excellent & add much.
The rest of the cast & chorus are excellent as well..
The orchestra &  orchestration as led by Riccardo Chailly are a marvel! Amazing atmosphere, lushness & warmth befitting this great Puccini work-----Giacomo certainly would have wept!!!
Visuals and lighting are superb - videographers need be highly praised.

A major caveat--- THE BAD SOUND! Sound engineers need to have their hearing adjusted. The orchestra, though wonderful, mostly overwhelms the voices; additionally, lips move a fraction of a second prior to hearing their voices.

Sit back, enjoy, pretend the sound is better----and don't forget to have your handkerchief in hand.",1408579200,10,1399,5.316742081447964

3529690,4,B001DHE9KG,"I have read the many reviews for all three of the Boheme performances that I currently own. What is quite clear is that each of them receives enthusiastic support by overwhelming numbers who see each as the definitive version! There are also those who totally dislike each version. There are also minor reservations voiced about each version by a handful of reviewers. So where does this leave the prospective new purchaser?

Firstly it is possible to suggest that there are at least 3 good versions available, all of which are likely to give great satisfaction to a great number of people. This is perhaps because this opera is such a fine creation that it enables the participants to rise to their best. So if there is a world class team engaged it is likely that you will get a world class result with little risk of failure.

Rather than give a detailed review of each version therefore I will attempt a general summary of the options based on these 3 productions. They are the two Zeffirelli productions at The Met and at La Scala. There is also the Copley production by way of comparison at the Royal Opera.
There are some key considerations in my opinion. Firstly the group of four men must work well as a team in addition to individual merits. Rodolfo, Mimi, Musetta and Marcello must also communicate strongly to each other in the same way. The end must be genuinely draining.

The Met performance delivers on all counts. Gheorghiu and Vargas both deliver a believable relationship with each other. All 4 men relate well to each other. Tezier and Arteta as Musetta also have a believable relationship and the whole production benefits from the extravagant, but always appropriate Zeffirelli concept ranging through an excellent garret, a spectacular Act 2 crowd scene, and the desolation of Acts 3 and 4. I personally feel that there are preferable Musettas and the small but important roles of Benoit and Alcindoro to those on offer here. The recording is of a good visual and sonic standard but it is a shame that it has not been produced as a Blu-ray (yet). This is a very slick and professional rendition.

The competing Zeffirelli performance from La Scala is very fine too. This musters a particularly vibrant team of men who relate especially well together. The Benoit and Alcindoro roles are, to my mind, more effective. The Musetta of Hei-Kyung Hong is simply outstanding and is a far more effective flirty portrayal which also shows considerable humanity and depth of understanding in the last scene. The role of Mimi is very different to that of Gheorghiu as Mimi here is of a far more `ordinary' appearance and without Gheorghiu's innate glamour and sheer `star' quality which always radiates through. Gallardo-Domas portrays much more the ordinary attractions of an ordinary and rather vulnerable woman. In this she is well matched by Alvarez. These two skilled singers relate well in these ways and their shared tragedy hits home at that level. For me, I find this even more moving than The Met performance for all that's star quality. On the downside however, I feel that the staging in Act 2 comes over as rather more cramped and thus relatively static at La Scala and the conducting and orchestral response is just a notch less crisp. A direct comparison between the starts of Acts 1 & 2 in both performances will show this - but the differences are quite small and do not outweigh the many other virtues.

That leaves the Copley production at the Royal Opera. I find my responses to this to be more uneven. The four men have the great advantage of being younger and not so well fed! The concept that these four men are living in abject poverty always stretches credulity when they are clearly considerably overweight as in most performances including the two Zefferelli options. However, the downside here is that Rodolfo in particular seems relatively immature and is unable to drag up the reserves of grief at the end. Alvarez does best at this followed at a short distance by Vargas. This Musetta similarly seems to lack the same sort of depth. One is aware that she is acting rather than being the part. Hei-Kyung is in a different league to this - and is also more seductively aware. The other men all do well but the star of this production for me is the Mimi of Gerzmava who has the youth, the voice and the concept of ultimate doomed fragility. The orchestral playing is possibly the best here as a result of fine conducting by Nelsons.

In conclusion then I would rate all three as fine productions in their ways with the La Scala / Zefferelli as first choice closely followed by the Met / Zeffirelli in second and with the Royal Opera production in third place. In the end though, it is all a matter of taste and personal preference as detailed reading of the many reviews will clearly reveal. Happy viewing and listening whichever you choose!

3529691,5,B001DHE9KG,"If you have never seen La Bohme, please be warned that there are spoilers in this review - indeed, the greatest spoiler of all, a giveaway of the ending. For you, let me just say that this is one of the best performances available on video or record - the Penguin Guide to the 1000 Finest Classical Recordings lists it as the best on DVD. Get it and be prepared for an unforgettable experience.

But most people reading these reviews probably know this opera, the most popular in the repertory (with Carmen its only competitor for the title), and know how it comes out. For you, let me say that Gheorghiu is a bit old for the part, especially in the filmed closeups. In Act I, this makes her less believable as the somewhat innocent, frail girl downstairs who will be seduced by the carefree Bohemian poet. Likewise in Act II, this is obviously not her first encounter with cabaret life or with the sellers of trinkets and their colorful displays. But starting with Act III, her age starts becoming an asset as it mimics serious illness, and in Act IV it becomes simply shattering. I really mean it when I say her portrayal of the dying Mimi is dangerous - at the end of the act, with Rodolfo's final screams ringing in my ears, I saw in the bathroom mirror that my face was red and swollen with emotion; I dared not take my blood pressure. I have seen hundreds of performances of this opera, in opera houses and on video, and have often been moved. The first time, as an American who knows (well, knew) that all stories have a happy ending, I was at first incredulous that the heroine actually dies and then as devastated as Rodolfo. Since then, I know what happens to Mimi but am still always moved, perhaps even more because the first time I didn't know (which is why I warned about the spoilers above), but never to this degree. If you have a heart problem, be careful - really.",1324339200,,1882,4.423631123919308

Watching it tonight, I have to say that it is--instantly--my favorite one to watch on television.  Splendid and nuanced singing and acting, very insightful conducting, the wonderful, wonderful Zeffirelli production....I could go on and on.

3529697,5,B001DHE9KG,"In December of 1981, New York's Metropolitan Opera unveiled what would become its all time most popular offering--Franco Zeffirelli's production of Puccini's LA BOHEME. The original cast included thee of opera's best known performers: Teresa Stratas as Mimi, Jose Carreras as Rodolfo, and Renata Scotto, so often cast as Mimi was Musetta. Critics praised the cast but were mixed as far as reviews were concerned--some believed the production was ""too big"" while others praised Zeffirelli's designs from the simplicity of the loft in Act I and Act IV to the largess of Act II's Caf&eacute; Momus scene and the understated beauty of Act III. The public fell in love with the new LA BOHEME  immediately and twenty eight years later, it is still a magical experience of opera.
This DVD, originally a Live in HD broadcast of March 2008, allowed movie goers two great opportunities. Seeing the opera broadcast in a large screen made it almost like being at the Met. Viewers also got to see behind the scenes shots such as the scenery being assembled, which for this production of the opera was just as interesting as the opera itself. It also included a tribute to the director, interviews with the performers and conductor, and an enchanting interview with members of the children's' chorus. Only some of the scene changes are included in this DVD as well as a portion of eth Zeffirelli tribute. The interviews are not included, however what is included is the wonderful performance of that afternoon.

As far as the cats is concerned, it was excellent for a live performance. Conductor Nicola Luisotti conducted the score with vigor. Tenor Ramon Vargas is the production's Rodolfo. His acting is good,  and he is at home in the role, though ""Che gelida manina"" is transposed down an octave which is not uncommon in live productions. Angela Ghorghiu as the young seamstress Mimi seems a bit if a stretch as the opera begins, but she is expressive and plays a woman dying from consumption with conviction. Ludovic Tezier and Ainhoa Arteta simply playing the tumultuous lovers of Marcello and Musetta. Paul Plishka performs the dual roles of Benoit and Alcindoro,  roles often performed by Met favorites later in their careers, a tradition that dates back to Italo Tajo in the original production. The entire cast works well together and seems to enjoy the performance.

The DVD transfer is good though not as spacious as on the large screen which is to be expected, but it is still a worthwhile disc that contains the magic of this beloved opera.",1257379200,2,2540,4.897674418604651

3529699,5,B001DHE9KG,"The Metropolitan Opera House in New York walks amid a financial crisis. To circumvent it launched a new way to capitalize. It took the opera theaters in simultaneous display with his theater. The success of this program can help a great deal this great theater out of this trouble. The views came to Brazil without being simultaneous, but being a big blockbuster despite presenting operas somewhat unknown to the general public as La Rondine and Orpheus and Eurdece.

The DVD release of those recitations was natural and expected by lovers of Great Art. Some titles are already available in the market, Macbeth, Manon Lescaut, Hansel and Gretel, Perter Grims and La Bohme few. Who can not watch the film has the DVD to save the day.

La Bohme I got my hands these days, the collection is entitled The Metropolitan Opera HD Live. Initially we have a presentation with Rene Fleming. The picture quality coupled with stunning scenery designed by Franco Zeffirelli makes this Bohme be perfect.

TEM innovates to show between acts backstage of the theater, the assembly of the scenarios and the work of support staff, the guys are very professional.

The soloists are all perfect, it would be waste of time commenting on each one separately. I have had many questions about the voices in these current DVDs. Everyone sings well, no one misses a note, no tune. And I suspect much of the manipulation of images and sounds recorded on DVDs in HD.

The current productions are thought to the video, the positioning of cameras and scenes to show us interact angles previously impossible to be seen. Gone are the scenarios of cloth and clothing from thrift store. The still cameras and light without focus are part of the past. The opera is now on another level. The voice becomes an element of the show and not the principal. Before we had singers, today we have artists.

Everything perfect, beautiful and flawless. Where are the mistakes of the singer, where's the fall of the dancer, where's the controversy? All who attend this La Bohme find it perfect, crying for Mimi and Rodolfo. We have a unanimous vote and as said the great playwright Nelson Rodrigues, all unanimity is stupid.

A pera Perfeita

O Metropolitan Opera House de New York anda em meio a uma crise financeira. Para contorn-la lanou uma nova maneira de se capitalizar. Levou a pera aos cinemas em exibies simultneas com seu teatro. O sucesso desse programa pode ajudar e muito este grande teatro a sair dessa encrenca. As exibies chegaram ao Brasil, sem ser simultneas, mas esto sendo um grande sucesso de pblico apesar de apresentarem peras um tanto quanto desconhecidas do grande pblico como La Rondine e Orfeu e Eurdece.

  Os lanamento em DVD dessas rcitas era natural e esperado pelos amantes da Grande Arte. Alguns ttulos j se encontram disponveis no mercado, Macbeth, Manon Lescaut, Hansel and Gretel ,Perter Grims e La Bohme so alguns deles. Quem no pode assistir no cinema tem o DVD para salvar a ptria.

  La Bohme me chegou as mos esses dias , a coleo se intitula The Metropolitan Opera HD Live. De incio temos uma apresentao com a Ren Fleming. A imagem excepcional unida a cenrios soberbos desenhados por Franco Zeffirelli faz dessa Bohme se tornar perfeita.

  O MET inova ao mostrar entre os atos os bastidores do teatro, a montagem dos cenrios e o trabalho da equipe de apoio, os caras so muito profissionais.

  Os solistas esto todos perfeitos, seria perca de tempo comentar cada um em separado. Tenho tido muitas dvidas em relao as vozes nesses DVDs atuais. Todos cantam bem, ningum erra uma nota, nada de desafinar.  Desconfio e muito da manipulao de imagens e sons nos DVDs gravados em HD.

  As produes atuais so pensadas para o vdeo, o posicionamento das cmeras e os cenrios interagem para nos mostrar ngulos antes impossveis de serem vistos. Acabaram os cenrios de pano e as roupas de brech. As cmeras estticas e a luz sem foco so parte do passado. A pera agora est em outro patamar. A voz se torna um elemento do espetculo e no o principal. Antes tnhamos cantores, hoje temos artistas.

  Tudo perfeito, bonito e sem falhas. Cad os erros do cantor, cad o tombo da bailarina, cad a polmica ? Todos que assistem essa La Bohme a acharo perfeita,  choraro pela Mimi e por Rodolfo. Temos uma unanimidade e como dizia o grande dramaturgo Nelson Rodrigues, toda a unanimidade  burra.

Vargas and Gheorghiu turn in solid performances but they are nowhere near the caliber they were in Traviata. Both seem not to be able to take their pieces at a proper tempi, they make Von Karajan's seem fast by comparison. This is not the conductor's fault as the rest of the opera plays well.

I found the extra features interesting, but distracting from the opera. Sure I've seen and heard Bohme a few times but I still want to see the performance as is and get into the story and music. Save the backstage stuff for the special features. Add to this the fact that Renee Fleming does more acting while interviewing cast and crew members during the performance than any opera I've seen or heard her in and you just have a big, jumbled, thing that is almost good on your hands.

3529709,3,B001DHE9KG,"I had enthusiastically looked forward to this live HD transmission and attended the performance at a local movie theatre.  While there is much to enjoy in this version, the shortcomings left me with an overall lukewarm impression.

A big disappointment for me was the transposition of Rudolfo's famous aria, Che gelida manina, down a half step so that it peaks at a high B instead of a C.  This is as good of a place as any to explain why I think transposition in a piece such as La Boheme just does not work.  Puccini used an almost ""through-composed"" style in his operas (following the lead of Wagner), which means all of the musical moments are seamlessly attached.  Key transitions, of course, are essential for the piece to come off as a unified whole.  When one section is changed, as is the case here, the whole scene suffers.  Even my brother, an avid Boheme fan but almost totally unschooled musically, remarked to me, ""Something doesn't sound right.""  Of course it doesn't. It's not that I'm in love with high notes; it's the tonal flow that matters to me.  What surprises me is that any conductor would go along with this common practice to accommodate the tenor.  Also consider that this was a highly publicized live production seen all over the world and destined for immortality on DVD.  Surely Ramon Vargas, a fine singer, could handle the higher tessitura for just one afternoon!

Another gripe is the casting of two cameo roles, Benoit and Alcindoro, with the same bass, Paul Plishka.  Sure, this would be fine in any other production, but here, with close-ups galore, it just looks cheap.

Angela Gheorghiu stills delivers all her trademark vocal goods, which are nicely suited to her vulnerable and believable Mimi, but alas, her age is starting to show and the camera is not always friendly.

I was most impressed with Frenchman Ludivoc Tezier as Marcello.  Ironically, in this unmistakably Italian work, he offers an authentic Parisian flair with a deep portrayal of the beloved painter.

All in all, these HD recordings are a treat, and I would not discount even this one.  When I watch it, I think ""If only...""  So close, and yet so far.",1226188800,19,2160,4.742627345844504
3529710,5,B001DHE9KG,"This is another filming of Zeffirelli's well-known La Boheme production, but it still looks fabulous. I loved what conductor Luisotti is doing with the orchestra, and it is good to have a recording of Gheorghiu singing Mimi, while her voice is still in good shape. Ramon Vargas is a good Rodolfo and baritone Ludovic Tezier is excellent as Marcello.

Highly recommended!",1224115200,3,370,5.065573770491803

When THIS ""event"" is available in Blu-Ray...I'll buy it.

This DVD is a recording of the performance of La Boheme at the Met on April 5/2008 which was transmitted in HD worldwide. The first night was on 3/29th with the same cast, and the reviews in NY papers and the one here by Ivy Lin were based on the the opening night performance, not the one used on this disc. I attended the opening and agree with most of Ms. Lin's observations, i.e.: Vargas ' voice being ""lyric,bright,ardent"" hitting
the high C in Che Gelida Manina ""delicately""; Gheorghiu's aggressiveness and sluttishness, and her being out of sync in her Act1 aria. I do not agree with her claim that Vargas was too chubby and phlegmatic to be a believable Rodolfo, but I tend to agree with her comments about the Mimi. I cannot blame Ms. Lin because I myself found Ms. Gheorghiu to be trying hard to appear too romantic and taken with her man. She practically  mauled him at the Cafe Momus with her exuberance.  I did not attend the April 5th performance but I listened to the PBS radio broadcast and saw the moviecast of the event,and was very  happy with the positive changes and improvement over the opening night performance. The excessive touching, smooching and other distractions were toned down, and the musical matters went on smoothly.

This disc has outstanding video and audio worthy of the Met's 50-yr old classic Zeffirelli production with an ideal casting of Angela Gheorghiu and Ramon Vargas in the principal roles, supported by a fine mix of veterans and newcomers to the Met. Everyone in this line up is gifted with enormous talent, rich voice and fine musicality. The conductor is a young but highly talented Italian who certainly knows his Puccini, and one who knows how to accommodate his singers' ideas without sacrificing the integrity of the music. True, he used some rubatos and expansive tempos here and there but always to enhance rather than diminish the musical and dramatic values. He supported his singers sensitively and the orchestera responded beautifully.

For some time, I was hoping the two singers would be cast  together in  any opera, not just Boheme, because I always believe that their voices are a perfect match in size, coloration, expressiveness and range. Plus, they possess truly beautiful voices, musical intelligence, innate musicality and elegant singing style. All of these qualities are evident on this disc. What I was not sure about was their chemistry together. Having seen the close-up of their facial expressions and subtle dramatic expressions, the total commitment and involvement throughut the opera by both artists and even split-second reactions, I do not know of any pair that could match such chemistry. Just incredible! They seem to inspire each other. Now I can understand why Gheorghiu, in Acts1&2, tried to convince everyone including the audience, her man and herself that she was REALLY in love with him. She was going to use this bit of realism to help her go through her slow death in Acts3&4 with  searing intensity and poignancy. And Vargas responded with such convincing sincerity that one cannot help but feel for the unfortunate lovers. Gheorghiu has been acclaimed for her acting, in addition to her singing, throughout her career, but it's hard to tell who the better actor is of the two here.

How about the singing ? Stunning, mesmerizing, magical, heartbreaking, ethereal. Stunning was Vargas when he discarded his lyric, bright-toned Che Gelida Manina on opening night and used his burnished, dark-hued spinto of late while preserving his customary warmth and sweetness. Mesmerizing was Gheorghiu in her Act1 aria with the movement of a graceful ballerina. Magical was the expansive Soave Fanciulla with Vargas visibly stunned at the sight of the radiant, beautiful Mimi bathed in moonlight and ushering in the sweeping splendor of this music with his magnificent sound. Heartbreaking was Mimi's farewell to the love of her life. Ethereal was Vargas' ""alla stagion dei fior "", ethereal as the snow flakes falling on the lovers at the end of Act3.

So, whose BOHEME is this ? Is it Mimi's or Rodolfo's ?  Buy this DVD and find out. Enjoy the quest for the answer.",1223769600,53,4389,5.148876404494382

8293253,4,B001DHE9KG,"No wonder this Zeffirelli production of La Boheme has had more performances than any other opera at the Met. The opera, of course, is a winner from the start boasting one of the most lusciously melodic scores ever composed - thanks to a truly inspired Puccini in his prime. Franco Zeffirelli not only directed but also designed this lavish production which captures everything that Puccini so lovingly put in the score - and even some things that he didn't - like the horse and buggy arrival of Musetta in Act 2. The singing of all the principals really leaves nothing more to wish for. All give spectacular vocal display and nuance to every utterance. One could, I suppose, wish that a couple of the young bohemians were a little more youthful but we can always imagine younger versions of these magnificent artists.",1519344000,2,817,4.76056338028169
