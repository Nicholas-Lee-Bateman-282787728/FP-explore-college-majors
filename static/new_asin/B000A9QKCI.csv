2380252,5,B000A9QKCI,"My husband entered the room when I was watching this and thought I was crying -- that's how hard I was laughing. And I am not generally a ""laugh out loud"" at TV type of person. Wonderful, ridiculous stuff that stands up to repeated viewing.",1141862400,6,240,4.355555555555555
2380253,5,B000A9QKCI,I bought this for my 30-something boyfriend. He watched the first DVD with several of his friends who had never heard of Ali G. They are all huge fans now.,1141776000,3,155,4.2
2380254,5,B000A9QKCI,"This DVD is hilarious, I recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest interest in Ali G. I've watched every episode at least twice and they are hilarious each time. Buy this DVD.",1141257600,4,183,4.411764705882353
2380255,5,B000A9QKCI,"When I watch these shows, I'm fascinated by how Cohen set these interviews up. He and his team really had to convince his subjects that he was for real. That there won't be a third season anytime soon doesn't come as a surprise (but it's extremely disappointing), as his fame and notoriety grows it isn't difficult to imagine his desired targets becoming fewer and fewer. There are so many damn good segments that had me on the verge of tears, pick them BOTH up!",1137283200,6,462,4.511904761904762
2380256,5,B000A9QKCI,"I was very upset to hear that Sacha Baron Cohen would not be returning for a third season but this DVD does provide some closer. If you missed Da Ali G Show when it first aired or if you want to relive the comedy then this DVD is right for you.

I hate when people say Ali G is offensive and racist when in fact he is just basically poking fun at himself. Sacha Baron Cohen is Jewish and most of his humor is just stupid fun. There are several appearances by politicians who try to survive Ali's odd and idiotic line of questioning. Then there's Borat the anti-Semitic person from Kazakhstan. Finally there's Bruno the Austrian fashion guru who attempts to makes other uncomfortable by acting as homosexual as possible. I have never laughed so hard at any HBO show and I highly recommend it.

Even though forty dollars seems a bit much for twelve, half hour segments you will get you money's worth over and over again. This set is a great addition to anyone's collection and I highly recommend it.",1136246400,18,997,4.442622950819672
2380257,1,B000A9QKCI,"This is a show of outright bigotry and extreme stupidity. He laughs at people's culture thinking he is exposing anti-Semitism. He is in fact attracting more of it. Governments have threatened to sue him and he has received death threats. This, to him, is a sign that his ""comedy"" is cool. You can always generate a reaction by throwing insults, which really is not cool. It is not only bad taste, this guy has a project of ridicule, the same Hitler used before sending his ancestors to the Gas Chambers.",1133827200,,503,4.6
2380258,5,B000A9QKCI,"Viewing this collection will have you laughing forever. This guy is witty, creative and has an uncanny ability to know what is going to make us laugh. Taking advantage of people who crave media exposure, and duping them so effectively, is ingenious! This guy is a brilliant comedian.",1131408000,25,283,4.916666666666667

2380291,5,B000A9QKCI,I like this series a lot. It has a lot of good crime reenactments. If you're into true crime. You'll like this series.,1436832000,,118,4.173913043478261

2380321,5,B000A9QKCI,I'm a big fan of ID love deadly women can't believe women are so evil omg! Have friends at work that love watching too!!!!,1359244800,,122,4.125
2380322,4,B000A9QKCI,"Season one of Deadly Women tells many stories of women serial killers throughout history, from notorious ones to stories most have never heard of before. From royalty to the unknown, season one tells stories of women who committed mass murders, killing many people before ever being caught.

The stories told in season two of Deadly Women are more recent and modern day. Stories of mothers who go after their children, women who kill their husbands, cousins, and other family, young girls who murder other young girls, and women and girls who randomly go on killing sprees of people they don't even know.

In both season one and two, there are interviews with people involved in the cases, family, survivors and experts like historians and psychologists. Each episode tells several stories, all having reenactments of the murders and their characters. Some stories are simply cold blooded murders, others are of women who are mentally unstable or are completely insane. Season one has great historical stories in it, season two can at times be painful to watch, as there are lots of stories of children who are the victims. While it's a good show with a lot of interesting stories, it's definitely not one to watch with the kids in the room.",1333584000,5,1241,4.904761904761905
2380323,4,B000A9QKCI,"I am a big fan of this show despite the fact it relies on re-enactments of crimes instead of documentary footage and isn't always accurate in facts.  On the plus side, sometimes the episodes have moments of black humor, thanks in part to narration by Lynnanne Zager, which makes it ""fun"" to watch despite being about true crime.  Commentary by retired FBI profiler Candice DeLong is always a treat, and  it is another reason to watch the series.

This particular DVD has the first two seasons, with the first season only having three episodes (it was a miniseries) with four cases profiled in each episode.  The second season also had a handful of episodes but had three cases profiled, which is the current format.  More and more episodes for each season started with the third season and continue to the present.  All of the cases profile women accused and usually convicted of murder in English-speaking countries.  Many of the cases are well known and have been profiled in other series, but this show often features cases of female killers from decades or even centuries ago.

While all of the episodes of this series are available on iTunes, seasons 3 to the present need to be on DVD.  I would also add a spinoff from this series called ""Facing Evil with Candice DeLong,"" featuring interviews with a number of women whose cases have been profiled on  ""Deadly Women,"" also should be released on DVD.",1328832000,3,1405,4.7407407407407405
2380324,4,B000A9QKCI,"One of my guilty pleasures is reading and watching true crime stories.  A lot of the cases on ""Deadly Women"" will already be familiar to crime buffs but it's still pretty diverting.  What I don't care for are the ""expert"" commentators, particularly the ""former FBI profiler"" who basically says the same thing about each of the perpetrators (i.e., ""This speaks to the evil at the core of..."") -- it gets repetitive.  The production values are mediocre and some of the directing is pretty cheesy (i.e., each murderess ends her segment by staring with cruel, cold defiance into the camera) but, overall, it's entertaining and a great way to ""kill"" a couple of hours.",1321747200,2,663,4.849557522123894
2380325,5,B000A9QKCI,"I am a hardcore fan of this show, largely because of Candice Delong. This dvd is short, yes. But I purchased it for $10.40 including shipping so i am ok with this. The reanactments keep me engaged and the stories are so captivating. I can't wait until seasons 3-5 are available I will be buying them all!",1314576000,2,304,4.350877192982456
2380326,3,B000A9QKCI,"i like it, i notice that some of your movie were more pricey than the store even with the tax. but this story its not same the one i been watched in cable tv.",1308960000,,158,3.676470588235294
2380327,3,B000A9QKCI,"I know that this was the first two seasons, but there's only 7 30min episodes.  I had seen most of them on the ID channel anyway, so I might just be miffed about that.  The later episodes are much better in my opinion, and for a few bucks more, you get almost 3 times the episodes.",1304553600,10,281,4.0
2380328,4,B000A9QKCI,"I actually bought this for a friend, for her birthday. She is very into learning about criminology, especially female criminals, so this seemed like a good fit. We've watched a few of the episodes, and they are informative, if a bit dramatic. She really enjoyed them, and I feel this show is a good fit for those intrigued by the macabre.

It should be noted, however, on the ""two seasons"" contained within, there were a total of apparently 9 episodes (a minimal 3 in season one, and 6 in season 2). In all honesty, I had been expecting more. It seems it had originally been a miniseries.",1299801600,13,588,4.4953271028037385
2380349,4,B000A9QKCI,"I thought the Ali G character was lame, but loved Borat (I bought this way before the movie came out). I think the Borat videos in this DVD set are funnier than the movie.",1291939200,,171,4.0588235294117645
2380350,5,B000A9QKCI,"I remember the first story that took my breath away.  It was the story of Ruth Ellis.  It was so compelling and so touching!!!  I loved the cinematography.  Dare I admit I used the ol' DVD recorder but I somehow misplaced the DVD.  I was so disappointed!! This particular show didn't come on as often as the other episodes.  I am SOOOO happy this DVD came out.  It by far surpasses downloading this on Itunes.  DVD's add clarity.  I'm not a stickler for HD & will never upgrade but it's definitely worth buying the DVD series.  I can't wait for the new ones to come out.  I also LOVE the commercials!! The commercials are more intriguing & beautiful than some of the actual episodes.

This may seem stupid to say but I never really thought much about these criminals being women.  I wonder what the average man thinks when he watches this. I also love the episode with the blood countess.  Anyone interested in that case should also check out the DVD Bathory-you'll need a region free DVD player to view it.

By the way the one episode that is out this season with where the body in the trunk of the car has maggots on it went too far!!!  I can't watch that portion.  I'm not opposed to seeing something real but the way it was manufactured I just don't care for it & it grosses me out and I don't gross out easily!!!",1283385600,5,1317,4.310204081632653
2380351,4,B000A9QKCI,"Well-written, well-made production of real life murders committed by women. Originally aired on ID (Investigation Discovery), this is a must-have for anyone fascinated by serial killers, female murderers, abnormal psychology and history. Well-known experts like Candice DeLong and Dr. Janis Amatuzio give interesting analysis. What sets this show apart is its finely-balanced drama and fact.",1281312000,11,391,6.127272727272727
2380352,5,B000A9QKCI,"Booyakasha!  Dis be tha bestest most hilarious-est DVD set eva, Aiight!

Hilarious comedy from Sacha Baron Cohen's 3 characters... Ali G: The Hip-Hop Journalist, Borat: The backward traveler from Kazakhstan, and Bruno: The Gay Austrian Fashion Critic.  Many prank interviews/encounters as all 3 characters with unsuspecting real and sometimes high-ranking famous people.  You'll laugh until you cry.",1234742400,,399,5.947368421052632
2380353,5,B000A9QKCI,"The great thing about this is that is shows how we as Americans view people of other cultures and countries. Ingenious, silly and very very entertaining!",1229040000,,153,4.923076923076923
2380354,5,B000A9QKCI,"I got hooked on Ali G when it was on HBO and bought the DVD's to make sure I didn't miss an episode. It is one of my favorite TV shows ever, right up there with The Office (british version)and Arrested Development. If you like the Borat movie, you will love the HBO shows - they are miles ahead of the movie.",1194220800,,308,3.9838709677419355
2380355,5,B000A9QKCI,"I'm a late arriver to the Ali G phenomenon but I had to check out the DVDs here based on how much I loved the film Borat. Sacha Baron Cohen deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Rowan Atkinson in terms of comic brilliance. The simple fact is that the least interesting character of the three he does is Ali G. A little bit of him goes a long away, but he's absolutely wonderful in many of these interviews such as the ones with Ghali, Baker, Coop, and Aldrin. The white pseudo-gangsta is an interesting concept, and the fact that he's British confuses many an interviewee. That the likes of Newt Gingrich are so accepting of him speaks volumes of our cultural decline. Based on past experience, they are not surprised to discover that the journalist in front of them happens to be a yo-yo. They probably find him non-remarkable. I love Borat's contribution to this series (as does everybody else I'm sure). His Guide to the USA is every bit as good as the material in the movie itself. There's even a rodeo segment here; although honestly, I found Bruno to have the best shtick of them all. The guy is hysterical and I am looking forward to seeing Cohen's movie--that will be soon be released--about him. Bruno is a gag a minute and a major improvement on Dieter from SNL. Oh, he won't be loved by gay activists but that's another reason why we should cherish him. All of the skits here possess varying degrees of political incorrectness and that's why they're so welcome and excellent. This one would be great to own.",1182038400,,1529,4.5234657039711195
2380356,5,B000A9QKCI,"The season 1 and 2 is something you must have if you are a true fan of Sacha. The two seasons have the original HBO episodes of the Ali-G Show which include episodes of Borat and Bruno. It is extremely funny and once you start watching it, you cannot stop. Recommended for Ali-G and Borat fans no doubt. Each season comes with 2 CDs which hold 3 episodes each, I think. Again very funny and something I would recommend.",1170460800,,419,4.3164556962025316
2380357,5,B000A9QKCI,Once I watched the first episode I couldn't stop. I watched the rest of the whole season and the following day I did the same with season two.,1168646400,,142,4.107142857142857
2380358,3,B000A9QKCI,"for some reason, the DVD began to skip after only watching it twice.  i was really disappointed.  i know it's not an issue with the DVD play because none of the other DVD's i own had that problem.",1168473600,,196,4.131578947368421
2380379,5,B000A9QKCI,"Extremely funny, very clever. One thing I don't like is that I think these Dvds are copying the ""Borat"" movie",1168300800,,109,4.5
2380380,5,B000A9QKCI,"Da Ai G show is sooo ridicuously funny! I constantly am watching episodes from both seasons again and again and if your someone like me who can't get enough of Ali G, Borat, and Bruno then there are a nice amount of special features with clips you otherwise wouldn't have seen.  This show absolutely cracks me up, Sacha Baren Cohen is pure genius! This is a must have in every household!",1167955200,,387,4.450704225352113
2380381,5,B000A9QKCI,"I liked the 2nd season a little better than the first, but that's maybe because I've had seen it first and so had higher expectations from the 1st season. Excellent shows! Great edition to my comedy collection. Sasha Baron Cohen touches up all sorts of contemporary issues through the interviews of most known politicians..",1167868800,,323,5.0
2380382,5,B000A9QKCI,Excellent Ali G Video.  If you have seen Boart you know exactly what to expect.  Each DVD also has unseen clips which are excellent.,1167782400,,132,4.458333333333333
2380383,5,B000A9QKCI,"I received my 4 dvd set from Amazon yesterday and started watching it while exercising.  The comedy is offbeat, irreverent, socially incorrect, and at times downright rude, but not in a mean way. I have not laughed so hard and so much since watching the Borat movie. These dvd's have some Ali G, some Borat, and some Bruno, who is not my favorite character. Well worth the purchase if you are not faint-of-heart.",1164672000,3,412,4.6438356164383565
2380384,4,B000A9QKCI,"After reading ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY'S hilarious interview with Borat, I decided to give these DVDs a try.

After just a few episodes I was laughing until I was in tears.

I LOVE smart, satirical, subversive comedies such as CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, RENO 911!, THE OFFICE (both the British and American versions), LITTLE BRITIAN, STRANGERS WITH CANDY, and WONDER SHOWZEN.

DA ALI G SHOW fits nicely with those dark, sinister gems of humor.

My only question is: are the interview and panel discussion guests for real? If I was being interviewed by Cohen in any of his guises, I would be cracking up. Are his guests in on the act, or are they hopelessly clueless?

I'm not sure.

Anyhow, great show, and i look forward to the movie.",1155686400,8,726,4.722222222222222

2380386,5,B000A9QKCI,"Though it is a little hard to understand what he is saying at first, after a few skits of this show it becomes apparent that Cohen is a comic genious.  The Ali G show is one of the best purchases I have ever made, and I have re-watched each episode; it gets better each time.  Da Ali G Show ranks among the likes of SOuthpark and Family Guy, and I would recommend this product to anyone. Respek.",1151539200,7,395,4.116883116883117
2380387,5,B000A9QKCI,"It's amazing how this comic genious gets to interview so many people and they are unaware of what is to come.  Three different personalities, one simply hysterical show.  I recommend this DVD combo to anyone with an open mind, or anyone with at least a sense of humor.  Definately worth every penny.",1143072000,9,299,4.711538461538462
2380388,5,B000A9QKCI,"Sacha Baron Cohen has masterfully crafted three very distinct interviewer personalities (Ali G, Borat, and Bruno), and uses each one's specific traits to get the interview subjects off-balance and keep them that way.  If you enjoy watching people (some of them very famous) react to completely bizarre questions and observations, this set must be seen.

Respek.  West side.",1141948800,6,373,5.396551724137931
