2191414,4,B0006Q93WY,"For a low budget, made-for-TV movie, this one is very good. It traces the rise and fall of MJ as an adult superstar.  MJ's behavior is never explained, just depicted, such as his obsession with plastic surgery.

Flex Alexander did an excellent job portraying Michael Jackson, although I question the interpretation of MJ's character. Here MJ is portrayed as an innocent trapped in a cruel, unimaginative adult world, an unsuspecting, too-trusting Peter Pan. Jackson is also known as cold, manipulative, and a shrewd businessman, which was absent in Alexander's portrayal of Jackson.  I would have liked to seen a more rounded presentation of MJ, showing all facets of his personality.

The makeup on Alexander when he depicts Jackson later in life is horrendous. In some scenes ( for example the 1993-95 MJ), the makeup looks greenish. For the current MJ, the makeup looks grayish-white. Still, Flex Alexander's acting manages to rise above the bad makeup, resulting in a sympathetic albeit one-sided portrayal of the King of Pop.

Frederic Tucker as Joe Jackson captures his unmitigated bullying and harshness. Lynne Cormack as Elizabeth Taylor is a hoot, but still very likeable. Cedric DeSousa was a great piece of casting as Martin Bashir--he looks and sounds like the guy. April Telek did not capture Debbie Rowe's brash, blunt personality at all. She is much too pretty and soft in the role.

There's several kitschy dream sequences, but they work fairly well here. It is as if the viewer is inside MJ's mind, viewing the world as he sees it.

All in all, the movie is entertaining and worth purchasing. I've watched it several times already. It's a must for all Jackson fans as well.",1107993600,10,1690,4.971631205673759

It's like they took every MJ cliche, added every tabloid story and some common known facts and wrote a script out of it inside of an hour. Joseph Jackson looks cartoonish with that cheap wig-fro and an UZI!!!! LOL!! The actor that played MJ sounded like he took 10 vicodin's before every line. The broad they had play Liz Taylor looked like an old $20 crack-hooker. It's just bad....and not as in the album, as in HORRID! There is no MJ music in it and the generic music they did use sounds terrible!

None of his songs were in this movie. NONE of the characters looked like who they were portraying. Booooooo!!!!! The costumes were purely tacky. The more I watched this movie the harder I rotfl!

2191430,4,B0006Q93WY,"To be honest, I was skeptical when I heard they were making this movie;  would this be just another ""puff-piece"" or would MAN IN THE MIRROR live up to its billing and deliver the definitive film portrait Jackson fans have been clamoring for?  As everyone knows, Jackson's musical exploits had already been documented in the authorized and highly-sanitized AN AMERICAN FAMILY mini-series, so it's refreshing that VH-1's MAN IN THE MIRROR keeps the musical interludes to a minimum and devotes the majority of its running-time to the more compelling human story of the Self-Proclaimed King of Pop's unprecedented implosion.  Starring in MAN IN THE MIRROR is the unlikely Flex Alexander (!), who overcomes his inappropriately bulky frame to deliver a sincere and memorable portrayal; from his pitch-perfect conversational tone to his wild eyes and expressions of shocked indignation, few performers have captured their subject so well!  I'm pretty sure there's some actual news reel footage sprinkled throughout (the ""Blanket Balcony Blunder,"" comments and clips from various Jackson family members), lending an authenticity to the film that is by turns poignant and disturbing.

  So why a four and not a five-star review?  Well, this being a Paramount release, the disc is light on extras and the picture is a tad soft.  Jackson's ever-changing appearance no doubt presented a formidable challenge to the makeup department as well as the film's cinematographer, and frankly I was expecting the picture to have more ""pop"" in contrasting the ""Thriller-era"" Michael with the bleached, ""Marcel Marceau"" Michael of the ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"" years.  Oh well, perhaps when this hits blu-ray such flaws will be corrected, and with interest in Jackson's lurid legacy at an all-time high, VH-1 may even deliver a sequel to pair with this film and the original mini-series -- a sprawling and exhaustive trilogy worthy of the MAN IN THE MIRROR himself!",1321401600,3,1938,5.242718446601942
2191431,1,B0006Q93WY,"This movie was poorly done. The acting was bad the storyline was all over the place and the entire thing was a mess.
Flex alexander looks nothing like michael jackson, the makeup they put on him was horrible. It looked like a container of powder was thrown on his face. There was also no singing in the movie. This movie is not worth watching it's actually embarassing to see.",1309046400,2,376,4.463768115942029

MJ seems to be a 4 year old @ 30-something. This portrayal of MJ is offensively funny. I died laughing when it came on TV during his trial. The Jackson miniseries was 12 times better than this piece of crud. It's such a B movie. But I loved its awfulness! If you're feeling down and you want to laugh, watch this movie. It's pathetic!",1296604800,6,494,4.32258064516129
2191435,3,B0006Q93WY,"Folks, this is a VH1 TV-movie. Do not expect ""Gone With The Wind"" here. It's actually closer to Ed Wood (of Glen or Glenda and Plan 9/Grave Robbers from Outer Space infamy).

Flex is a tad ridiculous as the King of Pop, but he does manage to make you feel for him and MJ. Much of the film is based on fact, although out of sequence (as is common with biopics to make a better story).

The ending (this film was made during the second MJ alleged child molestation trial) was a tad premature. The producers should have waited until the trial concluded before making this film, which would have made for a more satisfyling ending.

One gets the impression that there was a lot cut from the film, as the Diana Ross sequence that is repeated throughout much of the film is out of synch with events as the film describes them. The actress playing Janet Jackson, while making her sweet and sympathetic, takes some time to make you realize who she is portraying. The Joe and Katherine Jackson portrayers do a very good job, though, but the Liz Taylor caricature is WAY over the top and it makes one wonder if the grand dame of classic Hollywood ever sicced her lawyers on them.

Watch it with some beers and pizza with your buddies. Leave your brains a the door. Don't take it too seriously, and you'll be alright. It makes for some good unintended comedy in spots. Yes, its BAD, but in a goofy and entertaining way. At least its better that the abominable Pearl Jr. videos on MJ.",1296432000,3,1472,4.4206642066420665
2191436,2,B0006Q93WY,"I didn't however buy this on DVD or rent it, actually i did see it however on TV once, and I think Michael was the most wonderful and beautiful man. I feel like the movie itself made it look like he was easily manipulated, what i believe is that he put up with a lot of crap from the paparazzi, media, tabloids and who knows what else. I wouldn't say anything about the actors who were in the show itself, i just believe it is bad judgment towards Michael. Whoever wants to buy the DVD should think twice about the movie itself. Because this show is not for any MJ fan at all.
The movie in fact is sad, a bit depressing, and shows a lot of events that happened.
In fact this movie deserves no stars or credit at all.",1282348800,2,716,4.085106382978723
2191437,1,B0006Q93WY,"This movie supposedly about Michael sucks. It is a crappy mess produced by VH1. The guy playing Michael looks like SheNaynay from In Living Color. In drag. It's really bad. It has bad acting,  a dumb story line, lack of facts, is stupid, boring, and very negative. Makes Michael look like a retarded person. Wow VH1, didn't know you could go so low. You can tell they had a real bad attitude towards Michael and totally didn't see him at all, just the lying media junk from the 90's.

2191444,1,B0006Q93WY,"This TV Movie was suppose to be the follow up to 1993 ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"".

So I was very excited to watch it, thinking it would have some of the high caliber actors and charm of the previous film.  Little did I know how WRONG I would be.

This movie SUCKED!

1.) Flew Alexander (Michael Jackson Actor) Should be ashamed of himself. Disgraceful portrayal of an Afican American Icon and Music Legend.  I see why his career as an actor has fallen...

2) It portray's Michael Jackson as a ""wimpy or scared"" individual. (he was soft spoken and kind; Don't get it confused with weakness)

3.) It has little or NO reference to his Musical Career or Acheivements. (Mostly paints a negative view of his failed marriages and his trial)

4.) The stage make-up and wardrobe was horrible. (Michaels skin looked green rather than his real color that change due to his vitilago)

5.) No ""KNOWN"" Actors in this film

6.) This film was NOT endorsed by Michael Jackson or the Estate

7.) Though it displays aspects of his later life (kids, trials, and marriage...) they all seem to be out of Chronilogical order.

In all this film was just plain horrible.  If you are a BIG MJ Fan please stay away and DONT BUY THIS!  It will only upset you and make you want to ""kick yourself"" for buying it!

Hope this review helps :)

Forever a Fan of Mj!!!

The way they had it was that he still had dark skin when he met Lisa Marie in 1992 and he did not. She was still married when the first started talking and he did want to have sex with her before they got married. They had a far better wedding in this movie then they did in real life and they skip over the BAD album all together.

2191456,1,B0006Q93WY,"I happened upon this...this...I don't know exactly what to call it, but apparently VH-1 thought it was a biopic when they made it in 2004.  It's running right now on the TV Guide channel as part of the never-ending Michael Jackson coverage - I am amazed it's still being aired at all.  If I had been told this was made by a high school media class, I would still be surprised at the incredibly low production values, starting with the make-up.  Wouldn't it have been easier to cast an actor as Mr. Jackson who shared at least a passing resemblance with him?  Instead, they hired a big guy with a handsome face and tried shading his nose.  He looks like one of the Wayans brothers in White Chicks. If this movie were playing on Comedy Central it would make more sense.

Also, I have been watching this train wreck for almost an hour and have yet to hear ANY Michael Jackson or Jackson 5 songs - even in the concert scene. Did the Jackson family veto all use of their songs after reading the script?  Or after seeing that someone named ""Flex"" was cast as Michael?

If you are a fan of bad movies, by all means, check this one out.  It would be especially good for a group viewing - I think a previous reviewer suggested a drinking game.  Perfect.

By the way, Amazon doesn't allow you to give a review ""no stars"", so I HAD to give it ONE.  Meh.",1251417600,4,1342,4.281746031746032
2191457,1,B0006Q93WY,"You know how a movie is so bad that it's funny, and you watch it over and over again? This is not that movie. This is the movie where you sit with your jaw scraping the floor, wondering if everybody in the cast had naked pictures floating about. None of the actors did a bad job (the actor playing Joe was spot on), but the material is so godawful that Sammy Davis Jr. could've risen from the grave to play MJ and it still would've failed.

Most of the bad stuff has been covered, so I'll simply second all of it. The worst problem with this film, IMO, is that they portray Michael as a lovable, ne'er-do-well simpleton with a heart of gold, when nearly all aspects point to him being a very shrewd businessman (ask Paul McCartney!) who had a very strong hand in him image, at least until it all spiraled out of control. MJ was a genius, not just musicwise, but that's never touched. Everything seems to come about as if by magic or by chance, when Mike worked damned hard - too hard - to reach his level of fame. Pixie dust didn't make Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson made Michael Jackson, for better or for worse.

Speaking of pixie dust, portrayal of Michael's relationship with sister Janet borders on disturbing. They spend the whole film making googly eyes and calling each other Peter (as in Peter Pan) and Tink/Tinkerbell. Any 4th rate Jackson fan knows that Michael's nickname for Janet was Dunk, which was short for Donkey, but I guess that's not nearly as cute. By all accounts, Michael and Janet were NOT the ""big bro/baby sis"" type, but the very best of friends, and the closest of the nine siblings. If you can't get that relationship right, DON'T TOUCH IT.

The strangest part is that even with the bad makeup, they still couldn't manage to get the plastic surgery even remotely right, so it just looks like some black guy in whiteface. I really wish I could post a picture! I would recommend this for viewing, but ONLY because words cannot define the sheer awfulness of this movie. I don't mean it's just boring. I don't mean it's so bad that it's good. It's just plain AWFUL!",1251244800,7,2093,4.473821989528796

Please DO NOT be fooled by the rest of the reviews that give praise to this crappy depiction about Michael Jackson. This movie didn't reflect who Michael Jackson is. Flex made Michael look goofy and idiotic. Put aside his personal struggles, we all know Michael is known for his singing and his dancing and this guy, couldn't even bust out and do the moonwalk or even one of Michael's tornado spins!(I know no one compares to Michael, but he could have made his role of the king of pop a little more believable). Added to that, not one character in this movie even comes close to resembling who is being portrayed. Bottom line is, don't waste your time or money.",1250899200,3,753,4.544117647058823

  1:The movie begins in 1984-not when he began recording
  solo and having plastic surgery and first became a star.
  It just picks up where&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jacksons-An-American-Dream-The-Complete-Miniseries/dp/B00005TQ44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jacksons - An American Dream (The Complete Miniseries)</a>
  left off.
  2:The lead actor is dreadful. His face is flat and he
  looks more like Powder then MJ (if you remember that  movie. And his acting is,at best highly charicatured.
  3:Michael's manager in the 1980's Frank Dileo is depicted
  but under another name and the actor looks NOTHING like
  him.
  4:The events depicted in this movie read like a long list
  of the National Enquirer's strange and weird fact file
  they've kept on Michael for years. Nothing really  substantive is revealed.
  5:None of Michael Jackson's music is featured-to be replaced by needless dance montages to very ER-ish muzak.
  6:This is actually too short. No event is depicted in any
  detail,prefering to focus more on Michael's obsession
  with his Neverland ranch.
  7:His music career is horribly skimped over. The period between 1985 and 1990 (which included the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad/dp/B00005QGAX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad</a>&nbsp;period) is ignored completely. The emphasis
  always slings around Michael's odd personal life.
  8:The lead character does alot of 'justifying living'
  routines I doubt would ever interest the real Michael.
  9:The story clearly takes Michael's side in terms of his
  skin whitening.
  10:The ending is so cutesy and oozy it's almost
  unwatchable as we stare into the faces of children of all
  ages as Michael makes a bleeting case for his innocence
  as he confronts his current charges.
That pretty well covers it.",1115164800,38,2060,5.849829351535837

Somewhere in the season marks a day of travesty, and people who have seen it are either scared for life...or decided to take that memory of absurdity and throw it out the window.  Even if you're a fan, there's something wrong with this picture.  Hence this tv-movie I'm going to review, ""Man In The Mirror.""

~R3VI3W~

Months ago, I was watching Vh1 when they played a made-for-tv movie display the good side of Jacko, ""Man In The Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story"", and boy, it's about as ugly as Michael Jackson's mugshot.  Vh1 is the channel known for satirical tv segments and ""I love the decades"" laugh-a-thons, but this movie, the company is ACTUALLY being serious; SHOCKING!  Even though made-for-tv movies are the lowest-common-denominators of filmography outside of HBO, some of those movies have gotten some ideas right.  No chance of finding the right idea here, and I'm better of just smashing a mirror than watching it.

The things about this movie could've been promosing:

Having a covincing-looking actor to play Michael Jackson?...nope.

Oh well, since this is a MJ movie, can the movie have licensed MJ songs playing the music score?...forget it.

At least the movie is a biopic on MJ's problems, right?  That's right, and it's as generic as it comes.

Considering this the indirect sequel/spin-off of ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"", this movie is about what people should already know about Jacko through gossip magazines and ET.  After becoming independent from his abusive father, MJ does whatever music artist does to gain popular status: reinventing himself.  And by revinventing himself, I mean carving his nose and cover his vitiligo skin with ivory lotion due to the commerical incident (Thanks, Pepsi), following by building a theme park of his childhood dreams.  Eventually, his career goes into a downward spiral due to copyright lawsuits and the ever-popular, and current, child-molesting charges.

This could've work, because this movie's showing the innocent side of michael that some people are too prejudice to see.  Unfortunately, too many distractions occur to take this seriously.  I must meet the people of this movie's makeup department, so I can beat them up for doing an insulting job on the cast.  None of the cast look much like their real counterparts, and then there's the guy who played Mike.  Who thought smearing flour on his face instantly makes him MJ?  Not only is this the worse make-up job since ""White Chicks"", they don't seem to get the memo WHEN they're suppose to do a lousy job; if the real MJ was more light-skinned and carved in 1987, the actor playing him should also look more light-skinned and carved during that era!

Acting-wise...well, it's as convincing as the make-up job. I'm sure the Jacko actor had some convincing lines, but it didn't help for the whole one-dimensional vibe of the roles.  Another thing that annoyed me, besides the make up, is the rushed pacing.  Scenes are over way too sudden, and some didn't take the time for the scenarios to be fleshed out, especially the scene when Micheal meets the nurse and had children; that scene didn't take the time to add character on the nurse.  I felt the movie was in a hurry to get this finish, the same way I felt when watching this.

Speaking as a fan of his music, ""Man in the Mirror"" is a passable movie that could've been treated way better, even for a tv flick.  This movie would work if the cast were believable, the scenes weren't so rushed, and it would have actual MJ music in it (it worked for the MC Hammer tv movie); none of that happened, so it all falls apart in the process.  The only tv movie besides ""Man In The Mirror"" that would've deal with much more failure is ""Zolar""...and I still can't believe that movie made it on DVD.  So what if this movie did a good job at being sympathetic towards MJ...that's not enough.

FIN/\L WORDS: Avoid this like you avoid taking your children to Neverland Valley.",1109980800,7,3971,4.794117647058823
2191485,3,B0006Q93WY,"When I saw this DVD, I thought this was a documentary of MJ with real footage of the King of Pop, and not a staged performance deal.  It wasn't clear on the DVD what this really was, so I was suprised to see that it was kind of like a rip off of ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"" tv movie which was excellent.  Well, I was rather disappointed and thought the movie sucked.  But the amazing thing was that the movie actually got better as it progressed.  Then watching it the second time around was more enjoyable because I knew what to expect.  The make-up of MJ when he turned white was rather bad, I could tell it was some Halloween mickey mouse type of make-up.  And MJ's nose is too big.  It seemed to get slimmer when they showed him in recent years, starting in 2001 or so, but in real life, his nose got really slim in 1986 before the ""Bad"" album came out and it progressed to get slimmer as the years went by.  If they had a bigger budget they could of used cgi to make his nose slim, but  this was really low budget.  I also thought that MJ was a bit too bulky, kind of buff.  The real MJ is skin and bones practically, even during the ""Thriller"" days.  Anyway, this is kind of a sequel to ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"", and you know that sequels usually suck.  Well, I'm a huge MJ fan, so I am starting to like this movie.  The actress for Liz Taylor is horrible, and the guy playing Martin Bashir seems a little to flakey and smiles too much and he doesn't sound British.  The Lisa Marie Presley character was pretty good, so were MJ's parents.  Janet looked too skinny, she was chubby in the '80s.  It's funny how they showed the real interview with Latoya, because she looked more like MJ then the guy playing MJ in the movie.  Also the ""Bad"" era of MJ's life is not even mentioned in the movie, and that was the second biggest selling album of all time I believe and the title of this movie is ""Man In The Mirror"".",1109376000,6,1932,4.175675675675675
2191486,1,B0006Q93WY,"This is the first movie I have seen that I wanted to rip the DVD out of the player and break it.  The acting sucks.  In fact, the extras in the movie give better performances than the leads.  The story sucks.  You could make a fun drinking game though.  Watch the movie and drink every time MJ says the word neverland.

If you are not a MJ fan, you will hate this movie.  If you are a normal MJ fan, you will hate this movie.  If you are the biggest MJ fan in the world, you will HATE this movie.

Pop question hot shot....What's the stupidest idea ever?  No Michael Jackson music in a Michael Jackson movie!  Yep that's right.  No Beat It, no Thriller, no Billy Jean.  Just cheesey music.

Take the money you were about to spend on this DVD and pay someone to kick you in the balls, hard, because that would be better than this movie.",1109203200,100,835,4.1375

8042460,2,B0006Q93WY,"No! No! No! This movie is totally mis-cast, uses odd production choices, includes no Jackson music, and tries to cover too much of Michael Jacksons life in 86 minutes. Flex Alexander attempts to portray Jackson, even though he looks nothing like him. For the most part, he has the voice down, and many mannerisms, but there is no way you would mistake him for the real Jackson. Speaking of mis-casts, a character called simply ""Liz"" in the credits is undoubtedly supposed to be Elizabeth Taylor. Aside from her appearing like Jacksons fairy god-mother every time he has a meltdown, this actor looks less like Taylor than Alexander does Jackson. For me, the only convincing actor was the guy that played Joe Jackson!

The movie, released in 2005, starts in the early 1980s and races to 2004, the beginning of Jacksons trial.  Many events in Jacksons life are severely abbreviated or totally left out. For example, the Pepsi commercial accident, the Victory tour, and the history of the one glove are all rushed through (By the way, the movie would have you believe Jackson began wearing one glove to hide his vitiligo skin condition). Another example of abbreviated events involves his plastic surgery. Two scenes are shown  using the same footage, btw  of Jackson going through plastic surgery. After each operation the only visible difference is that Alexander has on lighter makeup. Its particularly noticeable after the second portrayal of surgery, and Alexander looks like he has on clown make-up!

Because the pacing of events is so fast and segments are short, subtitles are used throughout to make sure you know where you are in the time-line. The movie also uses actual footage of crowds at Jacksons trial, as well as footage of LaToya Jackson, OJ Simpsons car chase, the planes hitting the World Trade Center, and the real Jackson dangling baby Blanket over a balcony in Berlin.  Going back and forth from simulated events to actual events was distracting, especially since the type of film did not match. Another particularly annoying production technique was using hand held cameras through most of the movie. They provided enough movement in the film to give you motion sickness! Speaking of being sick, there is NO Jackson music in this movie. None. Nada. Not even an attempt to hear Alexander sing a cover song, let alone a Jackson song. I guess the music rights were denied or too expensive.

Once the movie hits the 1990s significant events are presented, including the Dangerous tour (93), the 1994 marriage and divorce with Lisa Marie Presley (that could be a whole movie by itself!), the marriage to Debbie Rowe (96), and starting in 1997, the birth of his children. Also, among these scenes are those showing Jackson hanging out with children. A good portion of the movie then becomes about his relationship with children and how it impacts his life and career. This story line carriers over into the 2000s, where we see the Jackson tribute show in Madison Square Garden (which coincidently took place on Sept 10, 2001, the day before 9/11), the 2001 Blanket incident at a Berlin balcony, the Living with Michael documentary (03), and the beginning of Jacksons trial in 2004. Its at this point the movie fades out and includes a subtitle that read  and Im paraphrasing  Michael Jackson denied all allegations. I guess the sequel would have included the trials!

This movie misfired in many ways. Instead of binge watching, this was cringe watching. Die hard fans might enjoy it, but average fans would do better to watch Michael Jackson: Searching for Neverland, or The Jacksons: An American Dream.",1517702400,,3618,4.935855263157895
