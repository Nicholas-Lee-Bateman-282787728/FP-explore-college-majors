8462853,4,B005985WEW,"I am a big fan of YCDTOTV and this DVD is very nice! I enjoyed the Match Game segment and the cast interviews, but again wish that more video would have included Q and A with the actors and crew. The main content of the DVD is about 30 minutes.

The DVD does include photos with commentary and local media coverage and backstage of Project 131, which was the reunion episode.

Good product for any die hard fan of the show. Otherwise, just checkout the SlimeCon Website. There is a lot of photos there too.",1321228800,2,506,4.315789473684211
