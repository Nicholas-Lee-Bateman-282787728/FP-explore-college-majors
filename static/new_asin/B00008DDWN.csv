1836021,5,B00008DDWN,"When I first bought Orphen, I was not sure if I did the right thing. I cannot claim that I am a maniac, but the least I expect from an anime is that the animation should be at least good, the music should be good but most of all the storyline should be interesting.
In the case of Orphen I would say that the animation - in my humble opinion- is very good, I fell in love with the music and as for the storyline it is unique. For instance, watching ""Grave of the fireflies"", the music is very good, the animation fair but the story etc. made it one of the best animes ever. The same as Orphen, in its category I definitely will say that it will become one of the best of its kind. The story begins somewhere in the middle, and it unfolds not just forwards, but backwards as well, putting the pieces together with a lot of action.
After watching all the episodes I was sure that the money I spent for it was a good decision (thanks god) because it was funny, dramatic, emotional and very interesting.
AS FOR THE STORY:
Orphen, the main protagonist, is a sorcerer who is trying to save his female friend, with who he grew up together as orphens and are like brother and sister, Ashley who was turned into a dragon, which is very destructive and dangerous. Clio is the girl that will fall in love with him and follow him everywhere, not to mention the fact that she will support him in everyway possible. Magic, is a young teen who is something like Orphens pupil and wants to learn magic from him. Well, most of the times Orphen proofs himself to be a rip-off, something that changes later on. Additionally, the Magician Guilt (where Orphen and Ashley were magician students)is divided in that: Some of them help Orphen and some try to kill him. To sum up, Orphen will stop at nothing to safe Ashley and return her to her previous human form, even if he has to sacrifice his own life.

As for you people who are not sure what to do I highly recommend the shows!!!",1099526400,14,1961,4.285714285714286
1836022,5,B00008DDWN,"Having gone into Orphen with no idea what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised from the beginning. I'm not normally a fan of fantasy titles, but there was something about this one that just demanded I keep watching.
The story is the highlight here; it's interesting and mysterious from the get-go and unfolds excellently throughout the series. One of my favorite aspects about this series is that it sort of begins in the middle of the story, and it unfolds not just forwards, but backwards as well, slowly piecing the past together via flashbacks and revelations.
I found the characters to be interesting and enjoyable. They made me laugh when I needed to, and made me sympathetic at just the right moments. Most interesting is the way things are turned on their head halfway through the series; you'll find yourself wondering who's an enemy and who isn't.
In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It was funny, intruiging, and dramatic. This is a title that definitely gets overlooked far too much; take my advice and check it out. I highly recommend it.",1069027200,21,1062,4.808743169398907
1836023,5,B00008DDWN,The first time I seen Orphen a friend had it. I did want to give it back. Orphen is magically addictive and oustandingly plotted.,1065744000,3,129,4.416666666666667
1836024,5,B00008DDWN,"This is a great series, I originally owned the Japan import version with bad subtitles. Im glad ADV is releasing this as a box set, they are one of the few reasonable anime distributors. Everyone else wants to rip you off now a days ex: Bandai, Pioneer, etc. Great story and great characters, leaves you wanting to see more when you're finished, too bad the sequel is not as dark and mysterious as the original. Story goes something like this, Orphen is a sorcerer on a mission to save his friend Ashley who was turned into a dragon, as a dragon Ashley is verry destructive and dangerous. Orphen will stop at nothing to restore his friend back to human form even if it means sacrificing his own life. Im not good at writing descriptions, amazon probably has a better more detailed description. Anyway trust me this is one of the better series out there.",1049155200,20,853,4.545454545454546
7981774,5,B00008DDWN,"I was wondering at first if this was the whole Orphen first anime(due to the rather vague descriptions that i kept seeing about it), and sure enough it is! If you want this and can find it under $20, I recommend going for it. Same English voice cast and all. You won't be disappointed!",1512518400,,285,4.296296296296297

7981776,4,B00008DDWN,"One of the best anime I've seen and still remains to this day. It arrived quickly and came packed nicely. The only complaint was the box was a little shaky and came apart somewhat but I don't really care bout that kind of thing really. The discs play great and it is so much fun to watch this show again. Looking forward to seeing the whole series now. Would defiantly recommend if your into magic and action(its also really funny, I was laughing a lot at it)",1461974400,,459,4.287356321839081
7981777,5,B00008DDWN,"Orphen is defiantly an underestimated Anime. The characters are very well rounded, the plotline is great, and outside of a few annoying filler episodes, it's flawless.  I really can't think of anything bad to say about this series. It was worth every penny!!",1257638400,,258,5.0
7981778,5,B00008DDWN,"By today's steep animation standards, Orphen looks a little dated. However, one should notice the care and attention to many details the animators used despite the absence of computer modified animation. The characters are likeable and well portrayed. Though there are issues and flaws, many of these are minor and easily overlooked. The story is engaging and full of surprises. Of particular note: the two trolls who seem to always cause Orphen a ton of trouble are wonderful comedic additions.

The anime gets high marks for fun, action, and characterization. Lower marks due to some inconsistency in the story and plot, as well as merely average voice acting.

Overall this is a worthy, classic anime addition to any library.",1198022400,,728,5.109243697478991
7981779,5,B00008DDWN,"One of the best fantasy anime i've seen.  Each episode is great in itself, a great story overall.  I liked the english and japanese dub, about 5 of the 24 episodes i switched to japanese because the english voices were annoying in those particular episodes.  Majic, orphens apprentice is voiced by the guy that did shenji in evangelion, everyone noes how notorious he is to being one of the most whiny and annoying characters in anime.  one more thing,  the ending is just too nice, no braveheart ending here folks.  I bought the import for $13, and it was of great quality, beautiful fold out boxed set.  Buy it, check it out!",1183248000,,627,4.544642857142857
7981780,3,B00008DDWN,"This was not bad. It took awhile to get into the story, the last few episodes make up for it. The animation is not to bad but if you like magic and adventure.  This will not disappoint you. If you are dragon fan the animation of the dragon will, I know i was. If you can forgive that then this collection will be enjoyable.",1156118400,3,323,4.046875
7981781,5,B00008DDWN,"I have just completed watching this series and I will say that it was most defintely better than others that I have watched. I usually watch more girly animes not to much fantasy but after buying the book I was hooked and the dvds were also very addictive. It's very nicely played out, the characters have there funny moments and than the serious ones. It's not cheesy either where you have to roll your eyes. It was done well and ended on a good note. I am going to buy season two though from the looks of other reviews it was not as great or up to par but what can we expect most things that are continued such as dragonball gt are never as good as the original.",1120176000,5,664,4.155038759689923
7981782,4,B00008DDWN,"I wanted to love this series so badly, and for the most part I did. If you are looking for a neat hybrid-fantasy setting with a good story - well look no further. This is a great anime with battles, romance, comedy and a very cool rune-bladed sword. The unquantified gushing from the other posters here are proof positive that this is a popular show. I won't go on about the nice animation style, neat plot-twists, well presented DVD sets, or any of the other bonuses you can read about simply by reading what others here have written. I won't even mention that the slightly uneven animation and repetitive ""computer game"" style music hardly matter when seen against the backdrop that is this series' story.

There are two MAJOUR downfalls in this series, and they are big ones. Ones so huge it almost makes me want to cry, because that they debase an otherwise priceless anime experience.

If the main episodes that push the story forward are heaven, then the filler episodes are hell. Boring, tedious and pointless - enough to make me want to throw the DVDs right out the window. I'm going to get specific and recommend that any serious anime watcher deliberately skip episodes 4, 5, 6, 11 and 18. These episodes are the bane of this series, and you can skip them without missing any important plot or character development (you may wonder where the annoying little purple dog came from, but trust me, you don't want to know).

The second problem are the `comic relief' characters, Volcan and Dortin. Their bizarre appearance and ridiculous characters almost sink this anime. The English Dub made a valiant effort to pass these two off as hobbit/troll type creatures, but there is no hiding the fact that they are completely out of place in this otherwise edgy anime. For comic relief they rely primarily on abusive insults and slapstick, dutifully avoiding anything witty or clever. Don't get me wrong, there are some genuinely funny moments in this series. But they are provided by the main characters doing or saying something that both adds to their character and doesn't disrupt the atmosphere. For example, Majic's spell the rock early in the series both contributes to the atmosphere while reminding us how immature his character is at this early stage - I won't spoil what he does, but it made me giggle, as does Orphen's response.

Perhaps someday someone will take this series and edit it into a series of two or three movie length episodes. They can edit out the pointless troll's jokes (although we may have to leave them in, we can edit out their annoying antics) and the pointless fuller material. Mark my words, that would have the potential to be the perfect anime... until then we have a fun series, a attractive boxed set, cool cartoon, a flawed masterpiece.",1109116800,16,2778,4.757261410788382
