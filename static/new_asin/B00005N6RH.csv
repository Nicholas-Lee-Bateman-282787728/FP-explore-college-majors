1628223,5,B00005N6RH,Fantastic movie - just have to see it after Once Were Warriors - its great to see Jake the Muss come good,1269043200,,105,3.8181818181818183
1628224,3,B00005N6RH,"Ordered because we liked ""Once were Warriors"". I have been trying to find this sequel for a few years. Wasn't sure at first because the cover is all in Spanish. There are Spanish subtitles but the audio is in English",1263686400,2,216,4.425
1628225,2,B00005N6RH,Is there any format available for the US?  If there is let me know.,1234224000,,67,3.7857142857142856
1628226,2,B00005N6RH,"""Once Were Warriors"" was beloved by several in the US, so I'm surprised that its sequel seemed to have no American release.  However, while that female had characters to whom many could identify, this film initially does not.  It starts with the main characters making stupid, self-destructive decisions for no good reason at all.  Relationships fall apart and develop for almost no reason at all.  People criticized Spielberg's ""Color Purple"" for not emphasizing that Mr. changed.  This film too shows that characters are dynamic, and many will be pleased with the ending.

The characters practically look like they could be in the Mad Max franchise.  In Hawaii, another Polynesian island, residents are known for wearing cotton clothing in bright colors.  This film is filled with people wearing black leather constantly.  Isn't New Zealand too hot for that?  You would think this was a part of the Matrix movie rather than something supposedly taking place in real life.  Some say that other countries don't have the rigid racial divisions that the US does.  However, like ""Whale Rider,"" this pretty much shows Maoris and no one else.  Some non-NZ viewers might get the sense that the islands are mostly Maori when that group actually only makes up 12% of the population.  And by the way, do New Zealand construction workers admire the Village People?  They show construction workers in short-shorts and I am almost sure that would not be safe for workers' legs in that employment environment.

Like many a film, there is female nudity here, but no male nudity.  Still, the film includes many males showing off their hard, tattooed, tanned torsos, including hot actor Temuera Morrison.  This film, like its prequel, does try to say that embracing one's ethnic heritage may heal those who are spiritually- and psychologically-wounded.",1193097600,6,1836,5.104026845637584
1628227,5,B00005N6RH,"Great demonstration of what addiction and domestic violence looks like on the inside.  Also great cultural stuff, especially the effects of colonization and christianization of native populations.",1193097600,,196,6.2592592592592595
1628228,5,B00005N6RH,"This is the sequel to Once were warriors and is well worth watching, is another of my favorites!",1425513600,,96,4.388888888888889
1628229,1,B00005N6RH,can't view it here,1423785600,,18,3.75
1628230,5,B00005N6RH,It is such a great film wish that the Dvd was made with a US version. But it worked on my Mac Book Pro,1403481600,,102,3.2916666666666665
1628231,2,B00005N6RH,"If you enjoy foreign films like me but you live in the states (I live in CA) what you need to play this DVD is an all region DVD player. I purchased the Toshiba HDMI 1080p all region unit (~$40)

As far as the movie goes.. I really enjoyed ""Once Were Warriors"" but the sequel totally fell short. The plot was sporadic and confusing and just ends in the wrong place in my opinion. Also, if you don't want to find out too much, DON'T read the synopsis on the back cover. It gives away too much.",1376870400,4,1417,4.8429752066115705
1628232,2,B00005N6RH,The first one was significantly better.  I do like how they focused on the father a bit more in this one and the 'lessons' he needs to learn but the movie is not the same without the first case. I don't know why they had to kill Nig Heke off he was one of the more engaging characters in addition to the father. I found the new characters not as intriguing.,1364688000,,357,4.028169014084507
1628233,3,B00005N6RH,"While it ties up some loose ends from the first movie ""Once Were Warriors"" - this sequel is not in the same class. The first movie was a rare piece of storytelling and an extremely moving piece that you're emotionally invested in almost immediately.",1334880000,,249,4.681818181818182
1628234,5,B00005N6RH,"I have been using the film Once were Warriors for a TX film in rehabs that serve clients with drug and alcohol addictions.  Fantastic and very powerful film.  I would love to be able to purchase the sequel to it: What becomes of the Brokenhearted, however  cannot locate a US format version of the film. If anyone can help me out with this issue I would appreciate it.  We have clients that would benefit from both films!",1314662400,8,421,4.428571428571429
1628235,4,B00005N6RH,"Jake the muss is back in the sequel to ""once were warriors"" and he is trying really hard to get close to his children and ex wife but the years of bad behavior have already taken their toll on jakes family. One of jakes sons is murdered at the start of the film while serving in his gang and this prompts the sons girlfriend and one of his brothers to join the gang and get to the bottom of who murdered him. This film is a little lower budget than ""once were warriors"" but overall it is a pretty good sequel and tamuera morrison delivers another knock out performance !!!",1297382400,10,572,4.209090909090909
1628236,5,B00005N6RH,"Follow on story from Once Were Warriors. Often the sequel to a good movie, is never any good imo, however this one flows on exactly as it should. All the old characters return and the story continues without any loss of info. I loved it!

Imatiently waiting to see if they ever bring out another version as they have left it open as though they could.
Bring it on!!!!",1280793600,6,367,4.318840579710145
1628237,2,B00005N6RH,"first and foremost I really enjoyed the movie having watched the ""Once Were Warriors"", however I was not aware that DVD's are encrypted for different regions. I was not able to play it on my DVD player. I would like to return it and get the right region for California.",1278288000,2,269,4.4

7946231,3,B00005N6RH,"I really really loved ""Once were warriors"" which is one of my favorite movies. With ""What becomes of the broken hearted"" one can recognize some of the characters. but this sequel is much bland, even the role of Temuera Morrisson is duller, the only beautiful moment of the film is at the end, when he regains the love of one of his children. Rena Owen is particularly absent from the film, and that's a shame. Nevertheless, it is a film that lets itself be watched. I give it a 3/5 rating, while I would have given ""Once were warriors"" a 5/5, and even if it was possible, a 6/5!",1516924800,,578,4.3119266055045875

7946238,4,B00005N6RH,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Were-Warriors/dp/B0000A02Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Were Warriors</a>&nbsp;(OWW) is a tough act to follow, having been one of the most potent and unforgettable films of the 1990s, as well as the most successful motion picture in the history of New Zealand cinema (up until&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-s-Fastest-Indian/dp/B001FCK5GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World's Fastest Indian</a>&nbsp;in 2005).

The sequel deals with Temuera Morrison's character more than any of the others from OWW, which is fine by me. Jake the Muss finally confronts his destructive behaviors (rage being at the top of the list); this is fitting since he was the one at the end of OWW who was farthest from saying ""enough is enough."" While on balance the sequel is no less dark than OWW, it is somewhat uplifting here to see Jake finally change (after getting a few helpful nudges from various characters).

The New Zealand Film Commission was probably happy to be involved in the production of a sequel that rightly disparaged gang life, since gangs weren't portrayed very negatively when the eldest son Nig joined a gang in OWW. I've read that ""The film's failure to live up to the high standards of Once Were Warriors is partly attributed to the fact that Polygram Filmed Entertainment was involved."" I don't know if this is true, but it could explain a focus on gangs instead of characters from OWW, as gang stories are more profitable for film studios. Jake's son Sonny (Jake had a 3rd son?), who wasn't even in OWW, suddenly appears on the screen as if we are supposed to be familiar with him. Sonny seems to have been added solely as a means to provide a reasonable connection to the gang storyline.

 Final Verdict  This film was made for fans of OWW in an attempt to tie up lose ends; it does this to a degree, but also opens up a whole new can of worms by beating on the hornet's nest of not one, but two Maori gangs. There is a 3rd book, but not a 3rd movie: if we want real closure we will need to read.",1440201600,,2407,5.512195121951219
