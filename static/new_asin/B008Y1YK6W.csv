8532355,5,B008Y1YK6W,This movie described me so exactly that I brought several copies to give to family members who are having a hard time understanding the disease. The only thing it lacks is that it does not describe the delusional thinking that can sometimes accompany a bipolar episode,1388793600,2,268,4.8478260869565215
8532356,5,B008Y1YK6W,"From personal experience, I thought both main roles (the 2 sisters) plus the role of the son of the one were very true-to-life.  The affects and confusion with everyone involved were very effectively portrayed.  For these reasons, I LOVED it.  The happy- ending follow-up was, sadly, NOT very realistic, although the ""choices"" that were declined, unfortunately WERE. Still, I would highly recommend this performance.",1363046400,2,416,5.46875
8532357,3,B008Y1YK6W,"A schizophrenic woman must move from one place to another as her sister tries to figure out how to deal with her outbursts and the effects on her family.  Good acting, especially from Rachel Blanchard.",1353456000,2,201,4.742857142857143
