1228116,5,B00000IREB,"David (Keir Dullea) and Lisa (Janet Margolin) are beautiful, sweet, and sad in this strange mental drama. David's brooding truly broke my heart. And Lisa's innocence filled it up again. Together they seemed like one whole (slightly 'off') person.
This story is about love. About loving yourself when the world doesn't see your insides.
Really beautiful.
And David's Dreams were spectacular!

1228117,5,B00000IREB,"This Movie, made in 1962 is a great drama about the healing power of love. The love all of us, disturbed or normal, long for. I am not a [strange person] or anything, but I still really liked watching the story of two deranged people making the best out of their horrid genetic defects. The movie is in black and white, hopefully they will colorize it soon.",1018915200,,357,4.343283582089552
1228118,5,B00000IREB,"This film is absolutely beautiful in every sense.  It is the story of two teenagers, David and Lisa, who are both in a home for mentally ill teens.  David is obsessed with clocks and has a fear of being physically touched  while Lisa can only speak in rhyme.  The film covers the powerful bond that  develops between David and Lisa. I think this film is wonderful. Both Keir  Dullea (David) and the late Janet Margolin (Lisa) are brilliant!  There is  also a fine supporting cast. Overall I would say this is one of the finest  films I have ever viewed.",960595200,42,553,4.45
1228119,4,B00000IREB,"As to the content and quality of this film, the other reviews here cover it really well. The thing I like about this film is that it was done well on an incredibly low budget. What I heard at the time is that the film was  made for $50,000. An absurdly low figure, even in 1962. The crew had only  one old Mitchell 35mm camera, so for every change of view, they literally  had to pick up the camera and move it. This accounts also for the fade out  to black at the end of each scene. The film is so artfully assembled that  when you watch it, you are totally unaware of the limitations the crew had  to deal with. I believe David and Lisa should be mandatory study for all  the wannabe indie directors hitting the scene today.",947289600,27,726,4.142857142857143
1228120,5,B00000IREB,"I just saw ""David and Lisa"" and am buying the video for keeps. Never having heard of it I rented this film on an impulse. It was a most rewarding impulse.  The brilliance of this film caught me completely off  guard. This film now sits on my list of favorite films. The cinematography  during certain scenes has a breathtaking ability to communicate the story  through the lens alone. The screenplay is brilliant in every way  conceivable. If you are a mental health professional you must see this  film. David and Lisa is directed with restraint and brevity.  Scenes end  precisely when their message is communicated,and no longer.  The acting is  a gift to the viewer. The art design for the movie is poetic and powerful.  This is one of the most seductive movies I have ever seen. This film moves  the viewer along effortlessly.  Am I raving about this film? Yes!  I concur  with the previous reviews that say that this film was ahead of its time. It  is still relevant today, unlike many ""issue"" movies that become  cliches and are painful to watch.",937612800,23,1053,4.635869565217392

  Then the camera  moves away to pan the whole societal context of insanity and sanity.  And  the boundaries become far more tenuous.

1228122,5,B00000IREB,"A few nights ago,  I watched the ""Oprah Winfrey Presents"" made-for-TV remake of David and Lisa on ABC. What a disaster.
David and Lisa has always been one of my favorite movies.  I saw it originally in  1962  when I was a sophomore in high school.  (I will never forget . . .  The dramatic tension was too much for Billy Levin, the friend I went to see  it with  . . .  just as they touched at the grand finale of the movie, he  burst into uncontrolled uproarious laughter.  I thought the other people in  the theater were going to kill him).
Anyway . . .
If Oprah Winfrey  wanted ""to introduce David and Lisa  to a new generation of  viewers"" (as was stated in the prologue), why didn't she just show us  all the original one (without commercials)!  And who needed Oprah telling  us all at the outset, ""This movie is about the healing power of  love.""  Hey,  if the director couldn't get that across in two  hours!
Keir Dullea, Janet Margolin, and Howard da Silva's performances  were impeccable in the original.  Sidney Poitier's performance (he played  the doctor in last night's redo) ran the gamut of emotions from A to B.  (I  have always been an admirer of Howard da Silva's progressive credentials --  he was a leftist blacklisted by the McCarthyites in the 1950's -- his  genuine caring and sincere humanity really came across on the silver  screen.)
And maybe sweat just looks better in black and white, or maybe  Dullea's raw gutsy portrayal was eons better than the polished frozen robot  performance of Lukas Haas, but all in all there is no comparison.  Last  night's Lisa did a whole lot too much long-shot bunny-hopping around the  set. The original director had the good sense to zero in on close-up after  close-up of Janet Margolin's beautifully bedraggled  fragility.
And  what's with the added dialogue of the doctor saying to the mom, ""We  stopped blaming parents 20 years go.""  Sez who?  I'm all for blaming  the parents.  The original movie really blasted away at the uptight parents  for screwing up their kid.  Right on.  (I think Oprah might have added that  line herself -- she probably spends a lot of time on daytime teevee telling  parents not to blame themselves).
The new version had a lot of stuff  about medication being balanced and how important meds were to certain of  the patients progress -- none of that in the original.
They cut out one  of the greatest scenes of the whole movie  . . . the one at the train  station where an uptight  citizen  lashes out at the kids, calling them  ""a bunch of screwballs spoiling the town.""  A really really  important scene in terms of showing the discrimination faced by people with  psychiatric disabilities, and the horrible pain it causes.
The new  version also cut out the sensitively-drawn portrayal of a gay male  character (David's chess partner), an overweight therapist, as well as a  very strong hispanic character, turning him into just another disturbed  anglo.  Leaving us with whitebread.  (Guess they didn't want to take any  chances with the network that axed Ellen.)
When the mother is come on to  by that particular character, David's ""delusions of grandeur""  speech (about the character's sexuality) is replaced by some ridiculous  savage sexual assault going on on top of one of picnic tables in the  background.  That sure helps make viewers feel sympathetic to adolescents  with psychiatric disabilities.
The new version had the female therapist  crying in distress when Lisa ran away near the end of the movie.  Give me a  break!  Kids are always running away from residential facilities.
There  was something so real about the original version, and something so  ""Hollywood"" about the new one -- no dramatic tension, no  nothing.
The music in the original really added to the drama; not so the  new version.
The original film was really a very beautiful fairytale  about how messed up people can help each other out of their respective  pits.  Unfortunately, mythic metaphor though it be, it has never been true  in my experience.  Anytime I've met someone as screwed up as myself and  thought Hey, this is it, we can just love each other and David and Lisa  each other into better human beings and happier lives, it's never quite  worked out that way, to say the least.
At least the original gave me the  feeling that I could still dream.  I still do love that myth.
The  original 1962 version is fresh in my mind because I had just rented the  video about a month ago.  At the time, I couldn't help thinking that it was  35 years ahead of it's time.  Maybe we should make that 45 . . .",929923200,54,4590,4.648241206030151

So sad to think there are so many young teens in need of such intense psychological help. The attraction between David and Lisa, although they are so opposite, he obsessive compulsive with a paranoid fear of being touched, and she a split personality schizophrenic, is so real that you are rooting them on from the beginning.  Kier Dullea who went on to play Dave Bowman in 2001: a Space Odyssey and Janet Margolin who played Woody Allen's wife in Take the Money and Run were both excellent, displaying a wide range of emotions, sometimes with just facial expressions.  Also of interest is David's positive transference with his ""headshrinker"" Dr. Swinford played by Howard Da Silva throughout the school year.  I also saw the 1998 remake-for-tv starring Sidney Poitier, Lukas Haas, and Brittany Murphy, produced by Oprah Winfrey, but still prefer the original in glorious black and white.",1469577600,3,1010,4.854651162790698

1228233,5,B00000IREB,"David and Lisa was an interesting, early study of Aspergers syndrome, long before it was recognized as a high functioning form of Autism.  The movie was from 1962, somewhat based on the factual observations of Dr, Theodore Rubin,  whose practice was in a private setting with mentally disturbed teenagers.  Aspergers was finally classified in 1982.  In the early 1960's,  mental institutions were leaving the dark, drug induced, shock therapy days of the Catch22 era.  This is a warm, brilliant depiction of the relationship of a boy with Aspergers and a lovely girl suffering from dissociative personality disorder - and how they helped each other.

Made on a very low budget in black and white film,  the story provides sparse clues on why these kids got sick.  But the clues, though subtle, are there.  Very well made picture.  Enjoyed it in paw hen it was first released; enjoy it more today.",1407974400,9,896,4.906666666666666

1228250,5,B00000IREB,"I first saw ""David and Lisa"" in the early 1960s and have watched it again at every opportunity. Set in a mental institution for youth, it is a most poignant story of bonding and love between two teens, Lisa (the late Janet Margolin), who has a schizoid disorder and can only speak in childish rhymes, and David (Keir Dullea), whose OCD manifests itself in an obsession with time, death, and germs. Margolin's performance is especially compelling, as she is gradually drawn out by David (the only person who truly communicates with her because he is willing to talk to her in rhymes). David, meanwhile, who at the beginning of the movie is a rigid, unemotional person (except when someone accidentally touches him, at which times he becomes extremely agitated), is humanized by his developing friendship with Lisa. The mutual development of David and Lisa is accomplished through a series of touching and winsome interactions.

Because this movie was made more than 50 years ago it presents an outdated picture of mental illness as well as treatment. However, this is to be expected, given its age, and should not detract from the beauty of the story itself. The reality is that the bond of love that develops between David and Lisa is somehow purer and far less pretentious than that which is found between many ""normal"" people.

Moreover, its portrayal of the prejudice that is displayed against the mentally ill (which we see in full force in the scene at the train station) is, sad to say, far from outdated. At the time ""David and Lisa"" was produced, it was a sorely needed reminder that those society deems abnormal are human beings every bit in need of love, affection, and acceptance as are the rest of us. This is a message still needed today.

One final note: In 1998 there was a remake of ""David and Lisa,"" one touted by Oprah Winfrey. Do not make the mistake of buying the remake. Everything about it, from the story line to the quality of the acting is far inferior to the original.",1379376000,5,1994,4.707736389684814

1228255,4,B00000IREB,"It may feel a little dated, but `David and Lisa' has enough going for it to make it a welcomed cinematic experience.  Sure, some of the acting can appear over-the-top, some of the plot points can seem redundant and some of the films logic can seem out of date, but overall, for the time in which the film was made (early 60's) this is a genuinely good film that can still be enjoyed and should still be admired for what it accomplished.

Before the likes of `One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest' became a cultural sensation, there was `David and Lisa', a small film about two mentally ill teenagers who form a strange yet pure bond, helping one another to break their mental barriers.  David Clemens comes to live at a boarding school of sorts for the mentally ill thanks to his fear of being touched.  His attitude puts off many around him, especially his fellow class-mates, but one girl in particular softens his character.  Lisa, a schizophrenic student (her other personality being Muriel), only talks in teasing rhyme, yet David connects with her and longs to help her.  When David's parents try and intervene (deeming his living arrangements unsatisfactory) David must take matters into his own hands to ensure his own recovery.

The film is very nicely crafted and directed.  Frank Perry almost lends a Hitchcock feel to the film, glossing over each scene with a genuine feeling of fear and or eeriness.  I liked this aspect of the film, for to me it really embellished the truth behind mental illness.

It's scary.

The acting for me is actually pretty solid, with one major exception.  I did not care for Keir Dullea's performance, and quite frankly he was the most important player.  I felt that he was far too over the top in most of his scenes, which was only accentuated by Perry's attention to the dramatic.  Perry's style of directing would have benefited from a more subdued performance, a more lived in as apposed to lived out performance.  Dullea tried too hard to delivery showy, when he should have been working on delivering controlled and tense.  Janet Morgolin was astonishing as Lisa, truly understanding her characters duel personalities and the importance of never playing things too extreme.  Howard Da Silva was warm and effective, reminding me a lot of Robin Williams in `Good Will Hunting', and Neva Patterson was outstanding in her few short scenes.  She grasped the importance of acting even when you are not the focal point of a scene.  Her facial expressions never stopped working the camera and so she drew us to her.  I even thought that Richard McMurray worked magic with his one scene, completely compelling.

The script was aces and deserving of the Oscar nomination is pulled in, and I'm tempted to say that Perry was deserving of that directing nomination, if only his lead actor had contributed to his directorial efforts.  Still, Dullea aside, this is a film one should see.  It's views on mental instability may be outdated and may turn some off, but when you take into consideration that this is a time capsule of sorts then you can appreciate the film for what it is.",1242950400,2,3109,4.748603351955308
1228256,4,B00000IREB,"This film is something of a double edged sword. While it is very well prsented and sensitivly acted,what we have learned about mental illness reneders it somewhat backward. Remember that in 1962 schitzo affective disorders were through by many to be caused in part by a patient's upbringing.  You know, their parents did this to them. In the film, for example, David's mother is presnted as rather rigid and autitorian. We now know that mental illness is just that-an ilness, caused by chemical imbalences in the brain. The two teenagers in the film were treated by psychotherpy, which is completely usless in treating schopherina. As I said, the film is well acted. Janet Margolin in paticular gives a haunting performance as a child like spirit-almost like a creature from another world.

1228267,3,B00000IREB,"One of the earliest independent film successes in America, both in terms of box office and critical acclaim at international film festivals (including Oscar nominations for direction and screenplay), was director Frank Perry's issue oriented David And Lisa, produced by Paul M. Heller (My Left Foot), which was the first starring vehicle for two young actors of great potential whose careers eventually fizzled: Keir Dullea, who would reach his career apogee in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Janet Margolin, who a year later would star as Woody Allen's wife in his directorial debut, Take The Money And Run. These days, Perry is most well known for his unwitting camp classic Mommie Dearest. But, back at the start of his career, Perry was what might be termed a social realist filmmaker who made several other films in that vein with his then wife, Eleanor Perry, who wrote the film's screenplay, adapted from the book, David And Lisa, by Dr. Theodore Isaac Rubin.
  While there have been any number of films dealing with mental illness and institutions (Harvey; John Cassavetes' A Child Is Waiting; One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest; Girl, Interrupted, to name the most memorable) few have been as well wrought as this- from the screenplay (remarkable in its prescience and sensitivity, given its year of release), to the acting, to the political commentary, to the 35 millimeter black and white cinematography, by Leonard Hirschfield, which renders many of the shots as sort of moving Ansel Adams photographs of cityscapes.... While Lisa clearly is the more disturbed of the two protagoists, neither youth would, today, be institutionalized, although they would likely be overmedicated since preschool, and given an assortment of irresponsible diagnoses, in this age of made up alphabet soup armchair maladies of autism for kids who are merely a little slow, or ADD (or ADHD) for kids who are a little hyperactive. David would be diagnosed as having Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), while Lisa seems to be suffering from some sort of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Her subtly lascivious and sexual touching of the statues in the museum, which echoes a brief scene of her fondling her own breast (albeit covered) after she realizes her attraction to David, clearly suggest sexual abuse, not true schizophrenia, nor anything worse. Thus, their reunion at film's end does not really suggest that love can conquer mental illness, but that it can help alleviate some of the problems that teenagers have faced since time immemorial, and which adults have often misconstrued. And, we have no reason to believe that David and Lisa will be released from the school anytime soon. Their admissions of love, without directly stating it, simply suggest that they have gotten over the worst in their lives, and can continue with their full recovery.
  Reputedly, the film was shot for about $185,000, but made over a million dollars in rentals after its 1999 release, by Fox Lorber, on VHS and DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD is rather standard. The only `extras' are some written filmographies of the three major characters, and director Perry. This film was also remade in 1998, by Oprah Winfrey, as a mawkish telefilm starring Sidney Poitier as the psychiatrist, and the execrable Lukas Haas as David. The original is better, and soap opera fans should note that Karen Lynn Gorney (then only fifteen), the original bad girl Tara on All My Children, and later to star in Saturday Night Fever, as Stephanie Mangano, plays the small role of Josette, another student at the school.
  All in all, this is a very good film, and one that without the advent of mass market DVDs would likely have had its negatives wither away in some vault. Instead, it can be seen not only as an important American film, historically, but one that entertains even as it enlightens, that rarest of artistic achievements.",1221004800,8,3926,5.060278207109738
1228268,5,B00000IREB,"David and Lisa, the film they used to show on the late late show in the '70s, at least on New York TV, remains a moving timeless classic and features outstanding performances by Keir Dullea as David, Janet Margolin as Lisa, and Howard Da Silva as Dr. Alan Swinford.  Based on a novel by  Psychologist Theodore Isaac Rubin it follows David as he enters a school for disturbed teens.
  The filmaking is done in the European new wave black-and-white cinematic style of the time (though it's American).
  Dr. Swinford uses a humanistic approach, really the opposite of what mainstream psychiatry has become.  For him the solution is to open up one's feelings as opposed to making one oblivious with psychotropic drugs as is the norm today.
  Anyway we find that David is very intelligent though he has some severe phobias:  touch, death, etc.  He meets Lisa, someone with multiple personality disorder her alter-ego called Muriel.  The film turns into a love story between the two as they in effect end up curing each other.  Through it all the sixties feel shines through as well as the acting, directing, writing (Eleanor Perry), and cinematography talents.  Da Silva does a great job, and a great comeback role from the blacklisting period (due to the fascistic Robert Taylor). But again a rare excellence is attained by Dullea who went on to 2001 fame, and Janet Margolin.  Shot in Philadelphia the final scene was done at the Art Museum.  If I ever visit there it would be as a tribute to this film (not Rocky).
  So if you're into great '60s cinema check this (one of my faves) out...but by any means necessary avoid the worthless Oprah version.",1189296000,6,1647,4.73943661971831
1228269,3,B00000IREB,"half a century ago, psychiatry was still considered new and exotic, and was prime grist for ""meaningful"" movies.  this was one of the big hits of the genre, with a pre-2001 keir dullea and janet margolin as overage teenagers struggling to overcome their awful lives with the help of friendly doctor howard de silva (no longer a communist, but not yet benjamin franklin).  it is a sincere and well-intentioned effort, tho nowadays strikes us more as a relic than relevant.",1181433600,3,471,4.875
1228270,4,B00000IREB,"I watched the modern version with Sidney Poitier; not a bad little show, but there was just so much that Oprah had to leave out for TV.

This is the real thing and unadulterated pop psychology.  It's amazing how back then, people knew a lot about OCD even if they didn't have the words we use to describe it.  Keir Dullea is great playing David, sort of like the boy James Dean played in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, with similar issues around his mom and dad, but without the sexual magnetism.  He's good looking, Keir Dullea, but you can't really watch him for too long without thinking of Noel Coward's famous riposte when he was asked his opinion of Dullea's talent.  ""Keir Dullea,"" he quipped, ""gone tomorrow.""

Nevertheless, although he seems a little old to play the part, he is miles better than Lukas Haas who played David Clemens in the Oprah version.  Haas seems to suffer from every other kind of mental disability EXCEPT for OCD.  Poor boy isn't really over being terrified in Witness.  Keir Dullea seems properly obsessive.  He was also very good in the wonderful Otto Preminger thriller BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING, also available now in DVD, but similarly, without a commentary track!  Why not?  What is preventing us from hearing how Keir Dullea feels about his classic 60s films?

If you watch real hard you will see the lovely Karen Lynn Gorney in a small role.  Karen was only 15 when she made this movie and her acting is first rate, an early warning of the massive talent that made her a fan favorite as Tara on ALL MY CHILDREN and then later, she made a million hearts flutter playing stylish Stephanie in the original SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.",1121299200,5,1651,4.590443686006826
1228271,5,B00000IREB,"I hadn't seen this film in decades, and I wondered how well it would hold up now. I needn't have worried: it's still as lovely & touching as I remembered, with the same quiet power that moved me as a teenager. The performances are wonderful, with Keir Dullea's David struggling unsuccessfully to conceal his terror beneath a calm, self-assured, even arrogant facade; and Janet Margolin's glowing Lisa, her big dark eyes conveying fragility, yearning, loneliness & a glimmer of hope with astonishing depth. And the stark black & white photography allows us to glimpse their souls in a way color never could.

As for complaints that the story ""blames the parents,"" please note that Dr. Swinford (a warm & compassionate Howard DaSilva) explains to David that one day he'll understand that his parents also had parents, with their own fears, doubts & unconscious drives. The film doesn't ""blame the parents,"" it merely points out that each person bears the psychological weight & demands of many generations, often unconsciously. This remains as true today as it was then. Psychological healing isn't about ""blame,"" but about recognizing the source of our inner wounds & coming to terms with them within ourselves. Whatever the cause of those wounds, once we're aware of them, the responsibility of facing them is ours alone.

And has psychology learned much more in the 40 years since this film was made? Of course! But that doesn't invalidate the film, both as an expression of a specific time & place, and as a metaphor for healing. No, it's not saying that love & compassion will magically overcome & solve all problems; but it is saying that they're absolutely essential for any hopes of creating a whole & meaningful life. The understanding & tentative union that David & Lisa find together is a beginning, not an end. Who knows what the future will bring? All they (and we) have is this moment, now, reaching out to one another in an often dark & frightening world. And that's a message which is never dated. Most highly recommended!",1121126400,75,2036,4.881502890173411
1228272,5,B00000IREB,"I saw this movie in high school for English class and I've wanted to see it again ever since but could barely remember its name or any other details. I wish I could remember what film version of Hamlet we were shown. Fortunately, I came across ""David And Lisa"" on Amazon due to their excellent cross referencing. The final scene takes place in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. I visited the Philadelphia Museum of Art last year but didn't realize there was any connection to this film. I don't think the statue that Lisa climbs onto is actually part of their collection.",1115337600,3,578,4.5673076923076925
1228273,4,B00000IREB,"""David and Lisa"" is a touching portrayal of adolescent psychosis and love for the first time.  Kudos To Frank and Eleanor Perry for not exploiting mental illness by the restraint in which they tell this story and not resorting to the histrionics that lesser hands would have resorted to.  Keir Dullea is fine as David, the youth with OCD, though I thought him a little mature for the role and a little Brooks Brothers.  Janet Margolin is a revelation as Lisa, the child-like teenage schizophrenic.  Howard DaSilva delivers solid work as their sensitive psychiatrist.  Unlike alot of social dramas of this period it holds up remarkably well.",1104451200,14,640,4.94392523364486
1228274,4,B00000IREB,"I had to laugh at one reviewer who noted the characters were stiff.  Yes, in fact, at the beginning of the film, Keir Dullea, who plays an emotionally rigid and phobic man (detached, deeply angry and invested in his own brilliance) is quite stiff.  That's the point.  He's terrified of encountering feelings he cannot manage and, worse yet, of really expressing how angry he is at his controlling mother.  Like ""Rebel Without A Cause,"" young David feels tremendous angst in his family:  He can't quite work out why his father allows himself to be belittled by his wife.  Slowly, the relationship David develops with his therapist becomes the healthy, appropriate relationship he should have had with his father.  It is this relationship that grows concurrently with and indeed, informs, his affection toward a very disturbed young woman, Lisa.

Now, I did not give the film 5 Stars because I felt Lisa's character, who speaks almost totally in rhyme, is rather unevolved.  What the heck is this increasingly annoying ""Tell me who do you see?"" shtick all about?  I wanted to know more about why this poor girl became the poster child for some hodge-podge, garden variety, mental illness.  Is she struggling with some unresolved electral complex?  Has her burgeoning sexuality sent her over the edge?  Or has her internal turntable hit one heck of a glitch?

Ultimately, perhaps it doesn't really matter how she got this way only that she is able to forge a connection with David, whose patience for her comes from someone having patience with him.  A nice nod in the direction of shrinks who really can make a difference.",1093132800,7,1620,4.882783882783883
1228275,5,B00000IREB,"This is a 1962 film about two young people in a private mental institution.  Young David, played by future ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" astronaut Keir Dullea, is, you might say, wound tighter than a cheap watch.  He won't allow anyone to touch him, and to say ""He has issues"" is a massive understatement.  Filled with rage and perfectionism, he has tried to turn himself into a machine of a person with no positive emotions, so that no one can touch his heart either.
Enter fragile Muriel/Lisa, played by a pretty dark-haired young lady named Janet Margolin, a Tony-winning actress in her film debut (later seen as Lazarus' sister Mary in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" and in small roles in Woody Allen's ""Take the Money and Run"" and ""Annie Hall"").  Muriel/Lisa, a schizophrenic with a touch of multiple personality disorder, speaks only in rhyme, sounding a bit like a walking Dr. Seuss character.
Lisa's complete honesty reaches David in ways that are unpredictable and compelling, and his relationship with his parents and his psychiatrist are equally deep and interesting.  The film unfolds in ways that make it hard to take your eyes off the screen, and while it is definitely dated 40+ years later, the depth of characterization, and the resolution of this multilayered story, pays off almost as well (it *IS* a bit predictable at the end, but one wouldn't want it any other way, as it turns out).
This is a nearly forgotten film, and it's a shame.  I happened to catch in on the satellite channel Trio, and if you, like me, really enjoy seeing something well done that's very different from the standard fare, I very, very highly recommend ""David and Lisa,"" and the critics of its time were very complimentary too.",1073520000,3,1718,4.787162162162162
7911404,5,B00000IREB,"When David and Lisa came out in 1962 its success was completely unexpected.  But it was a success from day one and I saw it on day one and many times thereafter.  It's rough around the edges, but Frank Perry was an excellent director and this was his first film, and his wife, Eleanor Perry was a terrific writer.  The cast was great and all rather perfect for their roles.  Everyone of course talks about Keir Dullea and Janet Margolin as they should, but rarely mentioned is the subtle and very moving performance of Howard da Silva.  The score by Marc Lawrence is kind of perfect, too.  The previous home video releases, including the DVD have all been in the wrong aspect ratio, something this Blu-ray finally corrects and the movie finally looks as it should.  The transfer is lovely and the movie still packs an emotional wallop after all these years.  1962 was my favorite movie year of all time and this was one of its finest films.",1519344000,,940,4.520710059171598

7911406,5,B00000IREB,"I'm a sucker for coming-of-age, love stories, especially ones about troubled kids who are largely considered outcasts. This is a beautiful tale of a young man and young woman who meet at a home for teens with mental issues. David is wound up very tightly and reacts very negatively toward being touched. Lisa has two personalities (with two names) and often speaks only in rhymes. Both are mastefully portrayed by Keir Dullea (later of _2001_) and Janet Margolin.

In the beginning, David meets Doctor Alan Swinford. He is a loving father-figure to the teens at the home, while he doesn't get emotionally involved in their lives. While this is movie isn't a comedy, Howard Da Silva does a great job playing the ""sraight man."" in contrast to the teens in his care. Da Silva was also coming off the Hollywood blacklist after about ten years, although he also was very active on the stage throughout his career. It was an excellent return to the screen for him.

I've watched this movie multiple times and never get tired of it. The movie is in black and white, and that seems to add to the lure of it. Because I wasn't distracted by the visuals, I was able to feel the emotions of characters more.

Mental illness was very much a taboo topic at the time, even more so for teens. This was a very groundbreaking and risky film for its time. The public responded well, as it grossed well over $4,000,000. That's outstanding considering it had a budget of less than $200,000.",1505606400,,1469,4.620689655172414

His writing is exciting in both fiction and non-fiction. It is his book that is adapted for this film; the screenplay by Eleanor Perry.  David (Keir Dullea) and Lisa (Janet Margolin) are 2 deeply troubled adolescents-- David having symptoms of severe OCD and Lisa of schizophrenia. Their illnesses isolate them from even their peer residents of the same psychiatric facility.  Little by little they come together, liking each other and honoring and respecting each's idiosyncrasies.
