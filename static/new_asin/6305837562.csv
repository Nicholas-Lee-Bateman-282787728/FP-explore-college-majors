1086502,5,6305837562,"I remember watching this movie on television with my dad when I was a kid,  it was our all time favorite.  Funny westerns were always our favorite and  this one is absolutely rib tickling and so much fun.  I was so excited to  find it was out on video, I bought one for my dad and myself.  I shared it  with my family and they thought I was crazy at first about being so excited  when the movie arrived on our doorstep, but they absolutely loved the 1  liners and laughed continuously.  Now if they would just put the 2  ""Walter (the dog)"" Bonanza series on VHS, I would be ecstatic!  (Does anyone remember the name of the movie with Wrongway Feldman, not the  Gilligans Island one, where they sing the song ""Wrongway Feldman,  please come home""?  He is overseas with harem girls around and it was  very funny, that is all I can remember, I was pretty young at the time, but  I loved the movie.)",968112000,4,895,4.263473053892215
1086503,5,6305837562,"If Evil Roy Slade did not exist, I don't think it could be invented today.  It has a great story, and it is very funny, and it is all PG, since it originally ran on TV.
Simply put, this movie IS the laidback type of line  after one line comedy that many studios and directors put a lot of effort  into recreating.  Only Evil Roy Slade exudes effortless charm, and has some  of the best and hammiest performances of all time.
If Evil Roy Slade had  been released theatrically in the last ten years, it would have had the  same effect on moviemaking as Nirvana's Nevermind had on music.  In other  words, there would have been no Armageddon, no Batman Forever, well you get  the picture.",964742400,27,685,4.365079365079365
1086504,5,6305837562,"I watched this movie with my sister as a teenager and we still use the wealth of one-liners as private jokes in our family (cachonka - wee). The only film that tops it for memorable quotes is Mel Brooks' ""Young  Frankenstein.""  Please watch it!  Spread joy!",961718400,7,257,4.543478260869565
1086505,5,6305837562,Saw this movie a skillion times in the wardrrom of a destroyer in the N. Atlantic in '73. Reached the point where we could say all the lines...ALL OF US! One of the funniest movies ever. Must see over and over again to see  what you missed in all the previous runs because you were laughing so hard!  Glad it finally made it to video!,961372800,6,334,4.123076923076923
1086506,5,6305837562,"I found this movie purely by accident one morning at 1:00 am when I couldn't sleep. I have since passed it on to several friends who all agree it is the best comedy they've seen.
The classic souvenir bank pen, black  smith, big fiddle under the chin and therapy session scenes are worth the  price of admission on their own and the arrest by, and escape from the  midget sherriff is  absolutely brilliant.
Watch for Bing Bell (is that  the door) and his final scene.
It's corny and slapstck but good clean  fun. It's worth buying and you'll watch it again and again.",960336000,8,566,4.446601941747573
1086507,5,6305837562,"If you like the Mel Brooks type films you will love this, it was shown on TV back in the seventies and a few of us lucky ones managed to see it. Once seen never forgotten!

Now the real thing is available do not miss it.",960076800,8,369,3.8421052631578947

1086509,5,6305837562,"This cult classic has finally made it to video.  Every western movie  cliche is lampooned in this made for TV movie starring (among others) John  Astin, Milton Berle, Mickey Rooney, and Dick Shawn-- with cameos by then  unknown actors such as Ed Begley, Jr, Penny Marshall, Pat Morita, John  Ritter, and Dom Deluise.
Evil Roy Slade falls for Miss Betsy Palmer who  tries to reform Slade, unsuccessfully. Slade even tries to change his name.  ""Evil John Ferguson? Nah.  Evil Lee Rich, yeah, that's good, that's  good.""
Dick Shawn plays the ""Paladin"" type character, Ding  Bell, hired to put an end to Slade.  Rumor has it his outfits were created  by Liberace's personal wardrobe designer.
Bing Bell likes to sing and  play his guitar as he rides along to ""keep my mind off the smell of  the horse"".
The puns and one liners come so quick and often, that  you will probably miss half of them the first time through.  But that's OK  because you will want to watch this film several times.
This film is  great fun for the whole family.",959644800,91,1031,4.602209944751381

John Astin is great in the lead role as evil Roy Slade, the meanest and angriest outlaw west of the Pecos. To truly appreciate the humor, sight gags and some of the strangest dialogue ever scripted for a movie, it's worth buying and watching once or twice a year.

1087514,5,6305837562,"I watched this movie with 4 other friends one night after we all graduated from high school and were going off to college. I didn't remember much of the movie other than John Astin's toothy grin and the fact that we were all rolling on the floor laughing.

About a million years later, I somehow spotted it on amazon, available as a DVD and put it on my wish list. Then I bought a copy for my brother as a Christmas present. We watched it as a family after we were all stuffed with turkey and had opened all the presents. I have to say, in the first ten minutes I found myself laughing so hard it was physically uncomfortable! My brother and one of my sisters and her husband had never seen it but also found it hysterical. It's starts out with Evil Roy as a baby all alone in the desert. This establishes Roy as a sympathetic figure and explains why he turns to, and even revels in, Evil. By the time he is an adult he is thoroughly evil and my favorite scene is when he kicks something that you could not explain a man kicking unless he is just completely EVIL! There can be no other explanation. As we come to the present and follow him in his daily activities, we see that not only is Evil Roy not apologetic about being evil, he really enjoys it. He doesn't make any excuses for being evil and instead is very proud of it. This makes things somewhat uncomfortable for him when he meets his true love, Betsy Potter, who requires him to go straight before she will be his. He wants to please her, but being EVIL is so thoroughly a part of everything he is, it just keeps getting in the way of all of his attempts to go straight. Finally, he can take it no more, and succumbs to temptation, and returns to his old ways. Dick Shawn's character, Bing Bell, is contracted to find him and bring him to justice, dead or alive. The Bing Bell character is quite similar in many ways to Shawn's role in The Producers, which was filmed 5 years earlier, so he is really good at it. Bell decides the best way to set a trap for Evil Roy is to romance Roy's true love and marry her. However, Evil Roy manages to ""rescue"" her from her own marriage and by the end of the movie we see that instead of Roy changing to follow the straight and narrow, it seems far more likely that Betsy Potter will change to accept him the way he is. As such, I suppose the moral of the movie might best be stated, ""Be true to yourself - even if you are a no-good, mean, and outrageous outlaw.""

The movie does have scattered weaknesses. I felt time dragged during the Mickey Rooney and Henry Gibson scenes. Others apparently disagree. I thought the main protagonists, Roy, Betsy, and Bing, were all great. Dom Deluise was also very funny. But most of the humor in this movie comes from John Astin himself, who does such a wonderful job of unabashedly loving Evil. Evil Roy is funny as a leading man for many of the same reasons Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Carribean is funny. In both cases, we have a man who is utterly wallowing in depravity, and loving it.",1388534400,,3042,4.2612456747404845

He just can't seen to get it right. First he meets a beautiful girl and now his head hurts than runs out of money as well to top it all, he has got to move away from his only home, the west. Now in the beginning of the show a wagon train get attacked by Indians sometimes they take babies as there own, later on along come some wolves to see what they can eat so they too leave him. Now that is saying something about him isn't it. Nobody wants him, so the story goes on that is why he doesn't like the good people and just robs and kills them. Now there is plenty more about this movie and tons of laughs, as well trying to get him fitted into society.

1087995,3,6305837562,"John Austin looks like ""Adams Family"" patriarch Gomez Adams decked out from hat to toe in a solid black outfit in director Jerry Paris' made-for-television western farce ""Evil Roy Slade"" as the eponymous desperado who struggles to go straight after he falls in love with a beautiful woman of virtue. Writers Jerry Belson and ""Pretty Woman's"" Garry Marshall manage to contrive some amusing situations with shameless gags. Everything in ""Evil Roy Slade,"" however, isn't always shameless. Nevertheless, you suspect these tongue-in-cheek scribes must have been searching something different when they promoted the villain to the status of the hero. Austin is in top-form as the dastardly outlaw. Comedian Dick Shawn cuts a quite figure as Marshal Bing Bell, a singing cowpoke with a guitar that conceals a rifle with which he is an excellent marksman. Bing dangles a tiny bell from his right earlobe. The running gag is that whenever anybody says Bing Bell, the other person mistakenly thinks that they are referring to the chimes of a door bell. No, it's not as hilarious as the old lady's name, Frau Blcher, in ""Young Frankenstein,"" but Belson and Marshall deserve credit for a full-fledged effort. By this time, television had gotten around to acknowledging the presence of gay men, and the characters here make two references to them as ""funny boys."" Although this goofy, lowbrow western is predictable, ""Evil Roy Slade"" has its side-splitting seconds.

Evil Roy Slade (John Austin of ""The Adams Family"") and his ruffians are robbing a bank when our anti-heroic hero encounters beautiful Betsy Potter (Pamela Austin of ""Rome Adventure"") and plants a big wet one on her moist, pretty lips. Suddenly, everything changes for Roy. Roy wants Betsy almost as much as he embraces evil. Roy and his gang set out to rob the stagecoach, and Flossie (Edie Adams of ""The Apartment"") turns informant when he ditches her to conclude his career as an outlaw. Roy and company discover her treachery when they try to rob a stagecoach jammed with an army of lawmen, including midgets on the roof. One of these tykes, (Billy Curtis of ""High Plains Drifter"") springs out of a box to tackle Roy. The posse captures Roy, locks him up, and the court sentences him to swing. Beleaguered railroad president Nelson Stool (Mike Rooney of ""The Secret Invasion""), who Roy and his gang have been preying on mercilessly for years, leaves his drooling bulldog to guard Roy as well as his incompetent relative, Clifford Stool (Henry Gibson of ""The Long Goodbye""). Stool has tied Roy's hands behind his back so that Roy cannot escape. Shrewdly, Roy plays of the hunger of the starving dog, drenches his bonds with gravy, and the dog gnaws through them and Roy escapes. Eventually, Roy succumbs to Betsy's charms and they move to Boston where he visit a shrink Logan Delp (Dom DeLuise of ""Blazing Saddles"") and can walk around without his hardware. Roy ends up selling shoes for Uncle Harry Fern (Milton Berle of ""Whispering Ghosts"") and becomes rather adept at it. Temptation overwhelms our protagonist when Harry entrusts Roy with lugging two bulging bags of currency to the Boston Bank. Roy delivers the loot but then purloins the bank guard's revolver and holds up the bank. The front page newspaper story reveals that Roy is heading back east. The elder Stool finally persuades Marshal Bell to intervene.

Some of the priceless gags occur when Roy strolls up the street in a western town during an early scene. He triggers shots into the ground at the toes of an invalid (Leonard Barr of ""Diamonds Are Forever"")whose legs are encased in plaster and relies on crutches to walk. Roy takes an elderly woman's shawl from her shoulders as she is poised to cross a muddy street and lays the shawl on the muddy spot. Instead of waiting for the old woman to lead off, Roy tramps on it as he goes his merry way. A woman sitting on a horse extends her hand so that Roy may help her descend from the steed. Instead, Roy pulls her off the pony and appropriates it for himself. At one point, when he announces his impending retirement from the gang, Roy passes out autographed wanted posters of himself. At another point, Roy terrorizes a sleeping infant when Betsy prohibits him from frightening adults. Happily, ""Evil Roy Slade"" just makes the grade, especially with its big finale in the church at Betsy's wedding. John Austin radiates evil like the dastard that he plays would and Dick Shawn is funny at Bing Bell.",1270425600,2,4475,4.8713910761154855

1088268,4,6305837562,"""Back in the day,"" TV-movies were something special.  They were well-written, deftly-directed, and featured some acting luminaries and rising stars.  1972's ""Evil Roy Slade"" is one of the best of the genre, initially appearing as an ""ABC Movie of the Week.""

Written by Jerry Belson and Garry Marshall, along with being directed by Jerry Paris, ""ERS"" stars TV stalwart John Astin (""I'm Dickens, He's Fenster"" and ""The Addams Family"") in the titular role, with great support from film and television stars Mickey Rooney, Milton Berle, Dick Shawn, Edie Adams, Pamela Austin, and Dom DeLuise, along with Henry Gibson, then, late of ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in and a pre-Golden Globe nominee for ""Nashville."" In smaller but pivotal roles are Pat Morita and a young Penny Marshall, who would later star in shows produced by Penny's brother, Gary (""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne and Shirley,"" respectively). Even a ""fresh-faced"" Ed Begley, Jr. pops up, years before his St. Elsewhere success.

Each of these jumps headfirst into the role in this farcical western, especially Shawn as ""Marshall Bing Bell,"" a self-centered ""pretty boy"" singing cowboy hired to bring an end to the crime of the evil Roy Slade.  Shawn doesn't really appear until the last third of the film but he makes up for his absence with an Emmy-worthy appearance.

Astin, brandishing his trademark grin, is a marvel as ""Slade,"" mixing parody with a little warmth in the story of a man who's ""evil"" because he feels that he is unloved, due to the circumstances during his infancy and growing years, and the West is his to terrorize and pillage.  That changes, somewhat when he meets a fair damsel in the form of Austin.

""Evil Roy Slade"" is the forerunner to ""Blazing Saddles"" and, possibly the Kirk Douglas-vehicle ""The Villain"" (1979) and many of the lines in ERS ""zing"" with the speed and sting of those in ""Saddles.""",1236124800,2,1879,4.961783439490445
1088269,5,6305837562,"Other reviewers have covered the plot, the actors, and their reasons for the greatness of this movie.

I'd just like to add some additional thoughts for your consideration:
Like a few other reviewers, I was one of those who saw it as a kid when it first came out, and as my wife can attest, I literally checked the TV guide/newspaper every week for YEARS to see if would be on TV again.  YEARS.  It meant that much to me to see it again someday.  Finally it came out on video, with bad reviews about the image quality.  So I waited.  Then out on DVD.  YES!  It is all that what one would expect, the movie, no frills, no DVD extras (it was a TV movie), just pure greatness for 90-something minutes.  The best medicine for whatever ails you in this troubled world.

So who will like this?  Not people who don't like simple silliness.  Just everyone who does.  If you groan at bad puns, stay away.  If you love them, stop reading now and buy this.

What, you want to know more?  As a western, think of it as akin to Blazing Saddles (which is also one of my favorites of all time) without the social/racial commentary.  While Blazing Saddles kills with both hilarity and gravity, this one stays light.  Perhaps it is as key lime pie to BS' chocolate mousse.  Sorry - not!  Both awesome!  Fans of any comedic one-liner movies should find this an absolute joy.  Airplane, Young Frankenstein, Princess Bride, Hot Shots, even the campy Adam West Batman, all greats...

What puts it among the best is that it is character-based and engages you in the story, above and beyond the endless one liners.  Evil Roy is both evil and sympathetic.  This one has all the classic story lines mashed up to make a delightful romp.  Changing for love, the renegade self-made ne'er-do-well rises up against the big business overlord (and his stumpy index finger), the retired glamorous hero rides again.  And who can resist the voice of Mr. Haney from Green Acres as your narrator (ala George of the Jungle)?

We old-timers (60's and 70's TV viewers) can love it for spotting many favorite actors.  Families of all ages can love it for the clean humor.  Detail-comedy-geeks like me can also love it for the densely packed quotable lines and the details that come out in repeated watchings, like those who memorize the Holy Grail and other movies (count me in).  Other reviewers have mentioned some favorite quotes.  There are too many to repeat, so you can find your own.  But the ""makes you want to spit"" line, from when Evil Roy looks down over a cliff, has stuck in my repertoire over the years.  (I'm not a spitter, but the line stays with you when you look down from on high...)

Hope this intrigues you enough to make the buy, as you won't find it at your local library, either.
Peace and hilarity to one and all.",1235088000,3,2796,4.491053677932405

1088273,4,6305837562,"Although made a whole bunch of years ago (1972), this holds up remarkably well as a comedy, no doubt due in large part to the fact that it was co-written by none other than Gary Marshall, the genius behind Big with Tom Hanks, among other great American comedy films. The casting is perfect; John Astin flashes his teeth a lot as the title character, which is appropriate, and Mickey Rooney is on hand as the stereotypical rich greedy RR tycoon out to take over the entire territory.

Also here are Milton Berle (!) as the owner of a shoe store, Edie Adams as Flossie (half the time called ""Floozie"", for good reason), Penny Marshall in a small role as a bank teller, and Henry Gibson as Mickey Rooney's numbskull nephew. The ""funny boy"" bits are hilarious, but there's a lot of other stuff here too that's just as funny. The ending is a real hoot.

Roy's the ultimate Western bad guy--gang and all--but inside he has a heart of gold. Kind of. At least that's what his lady love (Pamela Austin) firmly believes. He tries to go straight to please her, but dag nabbit, just can't do it. His attempts in the shoe store are truly funny.

1088274,5,6305837562,"It may have begun as a mere Movie of the Week, but it ended up as a marvelous stand-alone comedy film; one of Garry Marshall's best!

The scene where Evil Roy has to figure out how a shoe horn works in the civilized world is alone well worth the price of admission.

Sparkling dialog, fantastic sight gags, and a surprisingly sympathetic villain who wants to finally quit being an cruel bank robbing outlaw so that he can marry the beautiful newfound-love-of-his-life, the town's virtuous school marm. He discovers to his dismay that reformin' ain't quite as easy as it first may appear; it takes a heap of work.

The cast is outstanding--John Aston, Edie Adams, Mickey Rooney, Milton Berle, Dick Shawn, Henry Gibson, Dom DeLuise, Ed Begley jr, Pat Morita and in a wonderful cameo, Penny Marshall.

No.

This movie, despite its cult status today, was really just a cheaply made TV production full of less than cerebral humor.  It does a pretty good job lampooning some of the stereotypes of early westerns, and there are some solid jokes within.

However, there are several drawbacks.  Many of the jokes are literally beaten to death, such as the one regarding Dick Shawn's character, ""Bing Bell.""  Everytime, and I mean EVERYTIME, someone utters his name- someone else says, ""Get the door.""  It wasn't really that funny the first time.  After you've heard it about ten times, it gets really old.  Milton Berle is enticed into doing something more than once because someone else tells him that they will erect a statue in his honor.  This is not Mark Twain folks.

Dick Shawn, who I usually liked, is cast in a part making fun of the hollywood ""singing cowboy,"" but he plays it so idiotically that it's embarrassing to watch.

I have to say one positive thing.  They couldn't have cast anyone better than John Astin to be Evil Roy.  He gets everything just right.",1201564800,,1144,4.655

1088364,5,6305837562,"Most people are going to remember comic actor John Astin for his role as Gomez Addams on THE ADDAMS FAMILY television series.  As Gomez, Astin swaggered onto the stage and delivered one-liners and off-beat dialogue with impeccable timing.

However, I remember him most vividly in the title role of EVIL ROY SLADE, a made-for-TV movie that came out back in 1972.  On that first viewing, that movie became my favorite comedic Western, even outstripping James Garner's SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF.  It's really unfair to group the two movies together in some respects.  SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF tells a real story and Garner plays the character straight.

Some might want to throw Mel Brooks's BLAZING SADDLES into the pot for consideration, and that's fine.  I just preferred the with and quick turns of my two personal favorites.  I enjoyed BLAZING SADDLES, just not as much.

With EVIL ROY SLADE, the humor is over-the-top and moves at a purely frantic slapstick pace.  If you don't pay attention to EVIL ROY SLADE you're going to miss a snappy comeback, an offhand remark that is delicious, or a bit of physical comedy mugging for the camera that is to die for.

Where else can you get math problems like:

Betsy:  Evil Roy, if you had six apples and your neighbor took three of them, what would you have?

Evil Roy:  A dead neighbor and all six apples.

Or:

Evil Roy:  My definition of a nine-to-five job?  Nine guys robbing five guys!

Or:

Poker Player:  I got jacks with an ace.

Evil Roy:  I got threes...with a gun.

Poker Player:  You win!  Wow, you are lucky!

The laughs are often deft puns and plays on words, with Astin mugging his way through them in true vaudevillian style.  No one else could have played Evil Roy Slade.

Until the DVD arrived and I sat down to watch it with my son, I didn't know that Garry Marshall and his long-time writing partner Jerry Belson had written the script.  Looking back through the movie, it's easy to see Marshall's trademark of working with people he enjoys.  He gave roles to his younger sister Penny Marshall (and later created LAVERNE & SHIRLEY for her) and Pat Morita (and later cast him in the role of Arnold in HAPPY DAYS).

Anyone familiar with Marshall and Belson's work (on THE DICK VAN DYKE, THE LUCY SHOW, and the television adaption of Neil Simon's THE ODD COUPLE to name a few) will recognize the snappy patter and quick play on words.  No one did it better than they did.

The movie has a familiar plot, bad guy falls in love with pretty woman who tries to make him turn good, but the unrelenting, quick pace of the humor transcends the rather staid storyline.  EVIL ROY SLADE quite simply takes no prisoners.

Mickey Rooney plays Nelson Stool, the railroad tycoon chasing Evil Roy.  Dick Shawn stars as Ding Bell, the singing cowboy marshal Stool sends for.  Henry Gibson plays Stool's ne'ver-do-well nephew.  Edie Adams stars as the woman scorned by Evil Roy.  Milton Berle plays a shoe salesman who tried to help Evil Roy go straight.  In a hilarious role, Dom Deluise stars as a psychiatrist.  In an uncredited role, Ed Begley has a brief walk-on that's funny.  This talented cast all add to the timing and pacing of the movie.

If the rejoinders or the wry observations don't get you, then the visual gags or Astin's constant preening and monologues will.  The actors and actresses move like clockwork throughout the movie.  Even when you get ahead of the plot and see something coming (like Evil Roy getting stuck riding a Shetland pony with his boots dragging the ground), the sight of it being played out is goofball hilarious.

This is one of the most perfect family movies I've seen in a long time.  There's no profanity, no nudity, no innuendo.  It's just slapstick comedy at its purest form.

If you haven't seen EVIL ROY SLADE, you're in for a treat.  And if you have seen the movie, treat yourself to a return bout with the best comedic Western film ever made.",1201392000,15,3940,4.636231884057971

I was a senior in high school when I saw ""Evil Roy Slade"" in its debut on NBC in the Spring of 1972.  Coming just as ""Monty Python"" was beginning to be aired in the U.S. and before Mel Brooks hit the screen with ""Blazing Saddles"" ('73) and ""Young Frankenstein"" ('74) there had been little of this sort of zany humor since the days of Ernie Kovacs. And as a TV flick, it had to stay within the bounds of what was then proper without the language and sexual innuendo which the Python crew and Brooks could play for admittedly hysterical--but crude and non-family-friendly laughs. The numerous great lines (""9 to 5 job?  The only job I like is 9 men, robbin' 5!"")and John Astin's creation of ""Evil Roy"" and Dick Shawn's ""Bing Bell"" took on a life of their own among my friends and I back then.

1088598,5,6305837562,"you'll be hard pressed to find this many good laughs in one place, Western or any other genre.  Character-driven slapstick is a very difficult trick to pull off, but Jerry Paris was a veteran by the time of this movie.  Like the better episodes of the original Dick van Dyke Show, you actually find yourself caring about these people - even when they are painted with very broad brush strokes.
You've read the synopsis; I won't repeat it here.  Let's just applaud the perfect casting, especially John Astin - who made a career of playing people just *this* side of sanity.  Revel in the obvious puns (""Bing Bell"" anyone?), the in-jokes which will be lost on young people (The Paladin bits are priceless; and who remembers the Dodge Rebellion?), and - yes - the subtle bits which sneak in amongst the outrageous.
*Cat Ballou* may be a close second (Sorry, Tom!), yet this reaches farther, stronger into the sheer spirit of humour.  After it's over, see if you don't find yourself humming the words to ""Stubby Index Finger.""  It's enough to make you want to get a campfire going, just to organize a singalong!",990316800,5,1107,4.680412371134021
1088599,5,6305837562,"Leonard Maltin forever lost any clout with me when he panned this in a review.  Evil Roy Slade is one of the funniest, if not THE funniest movie ever made.  Every convention of western films has been turned on its ear.  John Astin as Evil Roy is manic enough to pull it off, while Pamela Austin as Betsy Potter is perfect for the role.  Every member of the cast is capable, and each apparently enjoyed his/her work.  The west was never like this -- unfortunately.",983404800,7,463,4.4
1088600,5,6305837562,"The name of the movie your are thinking of is ""John Goldfarb, Please Come Home"" or something very similar.
About Evil Roy Slade...Probably the funniest made for TV movie ever. Classic!",979862400,2,184,4.967741935483871
1088601,5,6305837562,"This movie is hillarious, disrespectful, and well-made all at the same time.  John Astin is joined by such notables as Mickey Rooney, Henry Gibson, and Milton Berle in this way off-beat western that begs to be watched repeatedley just to pick up all the one liners and subtleties.  Unlike much of today's comedy, Evil Roy doesn't include profanity or nudity.  It is viewable by all age groups.

In case there are those among us who would dismiss this movie as a bit on the silly side, they are probably the same ones who pretended that the Emperor was actually wearing clothes.  For those with open eyes and minds, this movie is a treasure and has made me a John Astin fan for life.

By the way, I, too, have an old t-shirt I'd like Pamela Austin to try on later!!",971740800,11,764,4.421428571428572

Watching it again as an adult was a real hoot.  Great movie.  It has a small amount of non-PC content that they probably couldn't get away with today, but if you can watch in the context of the 1970s production date, you'll be just fine.",1525478400,,394,4.077922077922078
