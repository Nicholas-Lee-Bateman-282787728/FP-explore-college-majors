8441109,1,B004TZ3Z9U,"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this set.  The prints were inferior. Also, the commercials and the trailers are VERY lacking in quality and quantity.  It is incoherent.  It was thrown togeher as an after-thought. This is the WORST "" Drive-in""collection that I have ever bought!  Check out ""Legends"" drive-in theater collections. They are superior in every way.  The Corpse Vanishes and Voodoo Man set will not disappoint you the way that this set definitely will.  Unfortunately, I was taken in by the titles of these movies. Do not make the same mistake that I did. And for $17.00, we'll--live and learn. If you read my other reviews, you will see that I try to be fair, as different people have varing tastes.  This set however was definitely a big waste of money!",1382659200,3,783,4.7555555555555555
