2296008,4,B0009K7S10,"I'm a person of color, so of course, I'm not cool with how 17th century Spaniards stole riches from Native Americans and used African slaves to do it.  But still, if there's a bunch of silver, jewels, and riches lost at the bottom of the ocean, I say go find it and let's make use of it.  So a guy named Mel Fisher, who has a deep chin dimple and a nice furry chest, brought together maritime experts and put years into finding the riches of a Spanish sunken ship.
This documentary is a nice mix of history, science, and maritime matters.  This work said as soon as Mel Fisher began finding gold, Florida and the federal government wanted to claim it for themselves.  Notice how they never argue that Spain or Cuba deserved the riches.  The work never makes the connection, but this reminds me of the Californian Gold Rush.  Once again, when one person finds riches, others come out of the woodwork and want to be down.
Sadly, actual lives were lost in this pursuit.  The work shows that Mr. Fisher now has a museum in his name and this documentary does make me want to visit it.  I wasn't pressed about seeing this film.  It sat in a certain queue of mine for many months.  Now that I have seen, however, I can say I enjoyed it and appreciated learning of this relatively modern expedition.  In fact, I think viewers who loved 1997's ""Titanic"" and Clooney's ""A Perfect Storm"" will really like this.",1198713600,5,1399,4.42578125

2296018,5,B0009K7S10,"This video filled in lots of details I need to understand the events leading up to loss of the Atocha and what it took to recover its treasures.  Interesting and factual, it was great to find out more about it, since I was in Key West and visited the Mel Fisher museum and saw a lot of the treasures brought up from the wreck.  It is a well documented video and is worth seeing.  I highly recommend this video.",1404086400,,410,4.1645569620253164
