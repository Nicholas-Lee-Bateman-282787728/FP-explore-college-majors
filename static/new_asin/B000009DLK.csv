If not, I urge you to read that one first.

No, the '79 COMPLETE version starring Vladimir Vasiliev is nowhere near perfect.  For a start, the picture quality is worse in this one than in the '77.  The problem becomes severe in scenes with dark backgrounds, such as at the beginning of the mourning scene at the end of the ballet, where Phrygia comes out of the darkness draped in black.  Sonically, this version fares no better.  There are a couple of minor skips, too, which seems to have been caused by problems in the master tape.

As for the performance itself, it is mistake-ridden.  The most noticeable mistake comes from Ekaterina Maximova--who stars as Phrygia--who in the Phrygia-Adagio misses grabbing her foot in one of those leg-way-behind-the-back attitudes.  Another mistake comes from Vasiliev himself, who, in the final battle scene, slides a little too far--due to the slippery floor--in a kneeling position, just after he lands from a leap; he saves the scene by intentionally falling to the side, pretending that it was all part of a deliberate move.  I also noticed that Tatyana Golikova, who danced the role of Aegina, missed quite a few steps.  The Crassus in this version, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gabovich (son of Mikhail Gabovich Sr.), may have made no major mistakes, but he gave a generally lackluster performance.  **NOTE: The latter two dancers' names aren't even listed.

However as always, the corps de ballet did a fine job.

So, the verdict?  In spite of the flaws, I would recommend this video, but to aficionados ONLY.  If you can somehow look past the imperfections--admittedly, there are many--you will doubtless find gold mixed in with the trash.  The saving grace?  Vasiliev, naturally! For it is here that we get to truly witness his greatness.  Bear in mind, this was a live performance, which means there were no retakes.  Yet, Vasiliev actually danced with such vigor and precision (aside from that one unavoidable mishap) in real life! On top of that, this was also a COMPLETE performance, so, all the material excised in the '77 version has been restored.

It's a pity, really...if this version had been blessed with all the original cast-members giving a near-flawless performance in their respective roles, and had been better shot, it might very well have rendered all other versions redundant.  Truly, a missed-opportunity...

NOTE:

This DVD is not in NTSC format.  Rather, it is in PAL format, which means most DVD players sold in North America will not be able to play it.  You can purchase a multi-format compatible DVD player at your local specialty electronics store.",1124150400,7,3063,5.3844537815126055

I am overjoyed that the live 1990 complete performance of the Grigorovich/Bolshoi Spartacus has been reissued on DVD.  Incidentally, this was the first Spartacus I ever saw.  And interestingly, I got the complete companion CD to this performance before I got the video.  So, by the time I purchased the video--which was in VHS format--I already knew the music by heart.  As a result, the visuals only added to the enjoyment, and it certainly clarified what some of the sounds I heard were.  For example, the crackles at the beginning of Act I turned out to have come from the thrashing of the whips on the floor by Crassus' henchmen.

So, what of the performance?  Well, although none of the original cast-members were still performing at this late date, the younger generation proved that it was every bit the successor.  The stars in this performance were: Irek Mukhamedov as Spartacus, Lyudmilla Semenyaka as Phrygia, Alexander Vetrov as Crassus, and Maria Bilova as Aegina.

True, Mukhamedov was no Vasiliev; he was about 30 at the time of this performance and was already a tad slower than Vasiliev when he was at that age; note that Vasiliev had to wait till he was about 37 before his legendary film-version was shot--albeit, poorly shot.  However, what Mukhamedov lacked he made up for with his athleticism.  I would like to call the reader's attention to the leap sequence that he does near the end of Act II, Scene 1, in which the final leap looks like a, for lack of a better term, spinning flying-roundhouse-kick (Vasiliev does a version without the roundhouse in the '79 and omits it entirely in the '77)--that's a mouthful! And he does it lightning-fast (regaining his former speed there, momentarily)--incredible!  Sounds martial-art-like?  That's how it looked.  A friend of mine said of Mukhamedov as being more of an acrobat than a dancer.  In any case, Mukhamedov danced the role with aplomb throughout.  Semenyaka, the former Kirov dancer, fitted nicely into the Bolshoi company.  She dances as Phrygia flawlessly.  She nearly matches Bessmertnova in technical brilliance, but is more expressive than the latter.

The two baddies here are also excellent.  Granted Vetrov's interpretation is coarser than Liepa's, but he brings to the role his own inimitable style--certainly a far better Crassus than Gabovich ('79 Vasiliev and '84 Mukhamedov) ever was.  To me, Bilova was the best Aegina in all of the videos (she danced the same role in the '84 Mukhamedov version).  She is slender and statuesque.  And her movements are clean and precise, which can't be said for Golikova ('79 Vasiliev).  Even Timofeyeva ('77 Vasiliev) was no match.

Also, the corps de ballet gives an excellent performance as usual.

Finally, as I've already raved elsewhere, the '90 version beats all others in picture and sound quality hands down! The DVD version is even better in that respect.  For once, you're able to see the background.  And what do you know?  It ain't always black! And you will hear Khachaturian's complete score (as modified by Grigorovich and Zhuraitis) in stereo.  Get this quick!

1197227,4,B000009DLK,"O blog de pera e Ballet publicou em Setembro de 2009 o seguinte texto sobre o bal Spartacus : ""O Estado Sovitico tinha a mania de se meter em tudo, queria controlar a vida de seus cidados. Nas artes no foi diferente: desenvolveu uma esttica que ele,  (o Estado),  achava ideal. Valores como o coletivo, o trabalho em comunidade, a simplicidade do campo eram os mais queridos dos comunas do sculo passado. Impostos de cima para baixo so uma aberrao do sculo XX.
  Toda arte produzida de forma artificial, por encomenda, atravs de algum burocrata do Kremlin, fica sem graa. No  o resultado da criatividade de algum gnio da msica, das letras e da dana. Primeiro Stalin adorou a idia desse bal, embora tenha morrido sem assisti-lo. Aran Khachatarian ficou incumbido da composio, seguiu a cartilha comunista, fez uma msica sem inspirao, fria, marcial, que abusa dos metais.
  Spartacus tem seu ponto forte na coreografia. Yuri Grigorovich coreografa belos nmeros, muitas vezes utiliza passos de dificuldade mxima para mostrar a superioridade sovitica nas artes sobre o ocidente. Quebra a seqncia dramtica, tira o ritmo da dana, o que importa  a dificuldade tcnica. Joga para a galera, aplausos efusivos a cada momento.  Algum burocrata  deve t-lo obrigado a isso. O bal Spartacus  um trabalho que os comunas julgavam ser dessa esttica. A luta dos escravos contra os poderosos romanos simboliza a prpria luta do comunismo contra o capitalismo, opressor contra oprimido. No podemos nos esquecer que o bal foi composto e produzido por encomenda na dcada de 50. Os soviticos tinham na lembrana a herclea luta contra os nazistas. Mais uma simbologia.""

  A coreografia e a produo desse DVD, gravado em 1970,  a mesma da comentada em setembro do ano passado. A diferena so os solistas, todos exigidos ao extremo de sua tcnica e fora.

  Vladimir Vasiliev faz um Spartacus msculo, herico e forte. Tecnicamente rgido, mas combina com o personagem. Ekaterina Maximova   pura sensualidade, charme. Sua Phrygia combina passos leves com movimentos de dificuldade mxima, consegue a proeza de fazer passos difceis parecerem fceis, assim so as estrelas. Maris Liepa  um Crassus burocrtico, viril e sem emoo. Dana bem, tem grande estilo, mas no emociona. Nina Tymofyeva faz de sua Aegina uma bela traidora, interesseira.

  A imagem do vdeo  em preto e branco, de pssima qualidade, as cmeras se perdem diversas vezes nas tomadas. O som esta uniforme, audvel. Os cenrios quase inexistentes , os figurinos rsticos , a luz  uma penunbra assustadora que mais parece um filme de terror.

1197235,5,B000009DLK,"I am only a minor fan of ballet.  However, this performance was truly moving.

Ballet must communicate its story without using dialogue.  The choreography and expressive dancing fully succeeded here.  The dancers' movements were both strikingly athletic and gracefully delicate and the costumes and scenery were extremely effective in setting the period atmosphere.  Aram Khachaturian's music was lush, beautiful and sometimes poignant, well performed by the theater orchestra.

The Romans, led by Crassus, are obviously the bad guys.  Having the Roman soldiers march in a goose-step like the Nazis was extremely expressive.  Also, in some of the scenes the motions of the aristocratic Romans were more fluid and graceful than those of Spartacus' slave followers, who were more primitive and athletic.  This powerful visual symbolism was used to show the class differences between the antagonists.

Phyrigia danced with heart-breaking grace, expressing feminine beauty at its loveliest.  Her love scenes with Spartacus were beautifully erotic.

All technical aspects of this dvd were first rate.

This production grabbed my attention from start to finish.  Highly recommended.",1126224000,29,1176,5.683908045977011

7905370,4,B000009DLK,"Most ballets feature prima ballerinas, but Irek Mukhamedov (Spartacus) was clearly the star of this work. His dancing was phenomenal. It was an eruption of masculine power, elegance and presence. I would certainly follow him into the abyss. Aleksander Vetrov was menacing and virile as Crassus. Lyudmilla Semenyaka elegantly danced the role of the sensual Phrygia who was the consort of Spartacus. She made many difficult dance moves seem effortless and flowing. She and Spartacus were the most well proportioned pairing I have seen. Their interplay was marked by many lifts in which their bodies intertwined like vines. This was different from other ballets I have seen. Some of the lifts exhibited the spectacular strength of  Mukhamedov. Maria Bilova was sensational as Aegina who conspired with Crassus to help defeat Spartacus. This ballet has strikingly dramatic concluding scenes. Except for the famous love theme, the music was unknown to me. Khachaturian's score was pulsating and vibrant. It worked well with every aspect of this piece. The Bolshoi Orchestra produced a great sonic platform for the dancers. The sound quality was excellent. Most classical ballets concern fairy tales like the Sleeping Beauty or phantasms like Giselle. This work features classical dancing but the interplay of Spartacus and Phrygia departs from the traditional pas de deux, and has more of a modern dance feel.  Another potentially unique aspect of this ballet is the prominence of a separate male corps de ballet. This is not my favorite ballet but it should have wide appeal to lovers of classical dance. I will never see the Bolshoi in person so it is great to see them in performances like this. There are a few problems with this film as with all ballet films.

I consider the overture to be one of the most exciting pieces of music I know (other than some parts of The Ring operas), and the following ""Might of Rome"" sequence keeps the feeling up.  In addition to the superb dancing, the acting is very moving.  Some time ago I bought another version by a different ballet company but although it was good, the Bolshoi version with Irek Mukhamedov and others is much better, I think (so I gave that one away).

7905373,5,B000009DLK,"This DVD is very enjoyable.  The positives are many and the negatives are minor.  First, Vladimir Vasiliev is a good heroic Spartacus.  He is not quite the equal to either of the Mukamedov performances with the Bolshoi Ballet, but he is the next most convincing Spartacus after that.  Ekaterna Maximova (his real life wife) is as good as any of the other Phrygias around.  She is lovely and delecate, yet strong-- and what beautiful feet and legs. Liepa is a good in his role and probably the second third or fourth best in my opinon.  My favorite is Alexander Vetrov with the Bolshoi.  (The Bolshoi practically owns the recorded performances.of Spartacus).  A very posiitive performances is that of Nina Timofeyeva as Aegina.. She performs very strongly with great technique.  She is my favorite Aegina except for both of Maria Bilova's Superb performances with the Bolshoi.  Bilova has an imposing statuesque presence, beautiful feet and legs and just the right amount of saucey iceyness with strong, strong technique.  Wow, she is good.  Even so, Timofeyeva is splendid.  Originally, I was going to give this performance four stars, but after considering the ensemble dancing of the male, female and combined ensembles,  I decided to give it five stars. They infuse such spirit and energy into the performance that it commands recognition.  The conducting and musical permormance has Algis Zhuriatis competing primarily with himself on other recordings.  All of them are excellent and display the right amount of lyrical beauty and, when necessary, snarly crudeness.  So, I highly recommend this disc, even though is is in black and white. The color of the ballet itself makes this barely noticable. For its age, the picture is very servicable.  Do not confuse this disc with the wretched one put out by Etoilies de Bolshoi. Again, highly recommended.",1362182400,2,1854,5.082781456953643
7905374,4,B000009DLK,"Like his compatriots Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shoastakovich, the Armenian-born Soviet composer Aram Khachaturian (1903-1978) was part of the famous 1948 repudiation after charges of formalism were leveled against the three -- and many other musicians -- by the Soviet musical politburo. What is most interesting about this biography of Khachaturian's life (and there are many very interesting elements) is Khachaturian understood the charge of formalism to be anti-people music.

Even though formalism is later defined in this fine film as music written to a formal style and not demonstrating the patriotic needs of Soviet realism, how anyone could interpret the heart on sleeve romance of Khachaturian as anti-people music is difficult to understand. If anything, the relatively simple way the composer ties melody to tempo engages people's emotions. Chalk that up as another of the great mysteries of Stalin's Soviet Union.

That and most other mysteries about composer Khachaturian are resolved in this empathetic 83-minute documentary released in 2003. It won some awards and rightfully so, for this is a consistently interesting film about the Soviet epoch and one of its inherited sons, Aram Khachaturian.

Featuring much of the composer's most famous music including excerpts from the ballets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gayne/dp/B0007INY2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gayne</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartacus/dp/B0009X24R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartacus</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Symphony-No-2/dp/B000006M93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Symphony No. 2</a>&nbsp;and the violin, cello and piano concertos -- the former with clips of David Oistrakh and Mstislav Rostropovich playing in concert under the composer's baton -- this film that helps define Khachaturian as a man of his hometown, Tbilisi, who went on to Moscow and gained international acclaim but never lost his feel or heart for his homeland and always traslated it through his music.

The film introduces his understanding about being Armenian: we are Armeanian, we are happy, and we make happy music. If you know this composer's music (and why would you be shopping for his biography otherwise?) you know that says everything about him and his scores. The piece of music with the most face time in the documentary is Spartacus, the composer's romantic tale of the Roman slave revolt.

Shot in modern digital technique, the film is clean and clear all the time, even going back to clips from the 1919 Soviet revolution and earlier. The orchestral excerpts are played by the Armenian Philharomic Orchestra under Loris Tjeknavorian. Pianist Dora Serviarian-Kuhn, the executive producer, plays portions of the piano concerto.

7905375,5,B000009DLK,"My review will focus on the ballet as my copy of this performance is on LaserDisc, not DVD. I have owned my copy of this performance for many years and always delight in playing it again. I have found this performance to combine beauty and excitement from its dramatic beginning all the way through. The music is beautiful and the dancing is both dramatic and beautiful.

Irek Mukhamedov dances the role of Spartacus with great energy and makes it easy to understand his popularity at this time. If my information is correct, this is one of the last performances he did for the Bolshoi before leaving to join the Royal Ballet in London. Alexander Vetrov dances a very threatening Crassus and joins with Mukhamedov in turning in a powerful performance.

Both women's leads, Phrygia, the wife of Spartacus, danced by Lyudmila Semenyaka, and  Aegina, the mistress of Crassus,  danced by Maria Bilova, are well danced by these two fine ballerinas.

For me the music is one of the major attractions to this ballet and the music is very well performed by the Bolshoi orchestra. Another feature is the corps de ballet. Spartacus requires a large number of men dancers and the Bolshoi can provide all of the men dancers needed. The icing on the cake here is both the men and women dancers do outstanding jobs.

All told this is a very rewarding ballet experience; if you're a fan of ballet, especially if you appreciate the music of Khachaturian, you'll enjoy this ballet performance.",1301702400,5,1476,4.791338582677166
