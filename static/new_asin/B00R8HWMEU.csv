6905855,5,B00R8HWMEU,"Jessica is just a gem in every form of workout she does! Her calm demeanor is very relaxing! Even if you don't usually like yoga, give this dvd a try if you're a fan of Jessica! ;)",1424649600,,180,3.891891891891892
6905856,5,B00R8HWMEU,very well adapted for beginners and older practitioners.,1424563200,2,56,6.125
6905857,5,B00R8HWMEU,"This yoga DVD has 2 30-minute stretches: AM Energizing and PM Relaxing. It is set outdoors poolside--with palm trees in the background and sun sparking on the water. The music is perfectly chosen to match the workouts. I have taken live yoga classes and have done many yoga workouts on DVD--this definitely is one of my favorites. I really like the outdoor setting and Jessica is encouraging and helpful; it's almost like working out with a knowledgeable friend. She offers form pointers and modifications, advising you to listen to your body. I liked the relaxation offered at the end of each session, and know I will come back to this DVD often. Highly recommended!",1423958400,14,667,4.859649122807017
6905858,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I've been desperately in need of the ideal stretching routine to complement my other workouts and this DVD fit the bill perfectly.

This DVD has two seperate workouts or ""practices"" if you will, that both lengthen, strengthen and tone the body, and do so gently.  No wacky binding moves, hand-stands, or pretzel twists necessary.  Perfect for Yoga beginners, or advanced exercisers such as myself, who are looking to lengthen without pain and discomfort.

Both workouts are filmed outdoors in a gorgeous setting complete with sunshine, next to a sparkling pool, and swaying trees. The music is soothing and on cue featuring soothing, gentle classical tunes, as well as relaxing, calypso-style guitar.  You don't have to be a ""yogi"" to do this DVD.  Like another reviewer mentioned, there is no chanting or sanskit, which can often invoke negativity in regards to the term ""yoga"".

AM Yoga is your more ""typical"" yoga practice, with standing, and floor exercises done on a mat.  Jessica shows beginner, as well as more intermediate to advanced moves for all the poses.  Familiar poses in this workout include warrior, reverse warrior, childs pose, downward facing dog, bird-dog, cow-cat and several others, done in a flowing sequence that is soothing, yet tones and lengthens the muscles.  This practice closes with a quiet, meditation.

PM Yoga is more of a stretching routine, and requires a mat, a small pillow (not necessary on carpet or a thicker yoga mat) and a towel or yoga strap to help stretch and lengthen your muscles.  (alternatively, I used a flat resistance band for the same effect).  This routine is great for use after a touch, vigourous workout, when you need a little more stretching.  There is also a relaxing, quiet meditation at the end of this routine that is very refreshing.

Both routines are great, and can be used seperately, or in complement to other workout programs or routines you may be doing.

This DVD is designed for ""beginners and beyond"" , but perfectly met me needs as a more advanced exercisor.  I am anxious to use it reguarly throughout my fitness journey, and beyond.",1421366400,184,2110,4.948863636363637
6905859,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I'm new to working out with Jessica Smith, but I just ordered both this Yoga Stretch DVD and her Walk On DVD since I've read wonderful things about her on the Video Fitness forums (where people post about at-home exercise DVDs).  This Yoga Stretch DVD is fantastic!

The main menu includes a short Introduction video from Jessica that explains the two workouts, and then the options of selecting either the Energizing Flow (designed for the morning/daytime) practice or the Relaxing Flow (designed for the evenings) practice.  Each one comes in at just about thirty minutes long.  In the Intro segment, Jessica recommends that you alternate between the two sequences.

To do the practices, you'll want a yoga mat, and, for the Relaxing Flow, a towel or yoga strap and a pillow.

The two sequences are filmed outdoors next to a pool, and it is just Jessica in each workout with some light instrumental music in the background.  I love her personality, and how she guides you through each practice.  Her cueing is excellent (which is particularly important on a yoga DVD when you can't always see the DVD), and both Flows are a nice combo of yoga and stretching.

In each one, she includes some traditional yoga poses like Warrior 1 and 2, but also mixes in some gentle leg lifts and other stretches.  The P.M. workout also includes a lot more stretching of the hamstrings and more hip openers (using the towel or yoga strap), which always feels so nice at the end of the day.

These are also great for many levels.  I consider myself to be an intermediate-level yoga practioner, and could see this being perfect for anyone from beginners who don't want something too taxing to more advanced yogis who want a gentler practice.

I can see why everyone loves Jessica, and will definitely be buying more of her DVDs!",1421280000,89,1811,4.729299363057325
6905860,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I have Jessica's other workout DVDs, and I follow her free workouts on her Youtube Channel, Jessica SmithTV, so I knew I would like this one, too. I was not disappointed!

I have been doing yoga stretches for years and I still found this worthwhile, but if you are a beginner, you will find it easy to follow...there are so many modifications to make the stretches easier or harder.

I got the instant download (from her site directly) because I wanted the digital version which is why it does not say verified amazon purchase.

Note: as she mentions in the info, there is no chanting or sanskrit.  The workouts are stretches in the style of yoga moves. There is no spiritual component to it at all. I just thought I'd mention that since the word ""yoga"" can invoke strong negative reactions. :)

You can choose from either the morning workout to get energized for your day or the evening relaxation workout. It includes both.",1420934400,130,925,4.615853658536586

I've been following this DVD for the last three weeks (usually the Energizing Flow 3-4x/week and the Relaxing Flow 2-3x/week) and there is a noticeable difference in the way I feel. I have toned up some of the problem areas (belly and butt) and my knees even feel better. I feel stronger and longer from using this DVD and I continue to improve on the techniques on a daily basis. When I first started I couldn't perform every rep of every exercise and would take a few breaks, but now I can follow along with no problem. Slowly but surely.

6906000,4,B00R8HWMEU,"There are two basic work-outs: Energizing, and Relaxing. I like the relaxing, as the Energizing goes too fast for me (even the relaxing routine a little quick for me).  I like the way she sticks to mostly a beginner routine rather than inserting too many intermediate and advanced options into the work-out. Other ""beginner"" DVD's were too confusing due to trying to cram too many options into the routine. Now if I can just get my lazy butt off the couch to do it lol!",1504483200,,469,4.517647058823529

6906022,5,B00R8HWMEU,I was looking for something that would help me with my lack of flexibility and this exactly what I was looking for.  There are two workouts that are thirty minutes each.  The first is strength and flexibility and the second is flexibility.,1502496000,,239,4.666666666666667
6906023,2,B00R8HWMEU,"The energizing part is yoga moves done fast, aerobically. She talks fast and does yoga fast with very little (if any) attention to the movements into and out of the postures. She is not a certified yoga instructor, she is a trainer, (aerobics instructor). The energizing workout was much more of an aerobic workout than a yoga routine. It made me sweaty and left me with a sore neck and lower back strain. She says during the workout to keep going ""for me"". Really?? For you? I'm supposed to do this for you?
The relaxation is not as driving, but it is the least relaxing routine I have ever done. It would make a fairly good morning yoga, wake up class.
The lesson that I learned here is to look up the instructor when buying a yoga video and make sure the instructor is certified and knows how to teach yoga.",1501718400,6,810,4.370860927152318

6906045,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this DVD and I was worried that I wouldn't like it. I have practiced yoga regularly for over 10 years, so I thought that it might not interest me, but since I like Jessica's other workouts so much I decided to try it. I'm glad that I did get it. This isn't like Rodney Yee, Seane Corn, Shiva Rea, etc, so if that is your expectation then you won't like this DVD. This is however a nice, soothing DVD that has yoga poses to help you stretch your body. You won't be doing sun salutations or power yoga. I enjoyed the soothing and calm feel of both workouts. They are both good to help with increasing your flexibility and stretching your muscles. If you are looking for something that has a yoga feel, but isn't intense then I think this is a good option. Jessica does a good job explaining what to do and how to modify the poses so that they are comfortable for you.

6906109,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I've done both practices on this DVD, and they are quite different (which is a good thing).
The evening routine is very stretchy and slow moving, and I really like the way that Smith uses the props to demonstrate and says ""if you can reach with your hands, do that""; most instructors will do a short demo with the prop and then go back to being an intimidating pretzel while this beginner thinks, ""I'll never be able to do THAT!""
The morning routine is a very good workout without being a killer for those working on gaining fitness and flexibility--you will know that you are using your muscles and getting some tone, flexibility, and strength. Smith builds you to more difficult movements by starting small, then letting you know if this is your limit today, repeat that level while she goes on to do slightly more difficult versions of the movements. It's very easy to decide where to stop and repeat or continue depending on your own fitness and flexibility.",1486857600,17,962,4.6647058823529415

6906121,4,B00R8HWMEU,"This is a really awesome yoga dvd, I would highly recommend it. The relaxing flow is especially effective, but the energizing flow wasn't exactly what I expected. It will definitely help me, though.
The dvd isn't totally user friendly for naive people like me; it took awhile to figure out that to make it play, you have to click not on the word, but the little line that pops up underneath it when you hover over it.
Overall, great stretch routine for about any level of ability- Jessica gives you a lot of options as to how far to take it (in difficulty), so almost anyone can benefit. I have only tried the AM and PM flows once each, but I already feel like they could be very helpful in improving posture and decreasing some of my neck and back muscle pain (I have mild scoliosis).
P.S. It is totally true... no creepy chanting or spiritual component, just a good stretch. The music in the PM flow has an extremely relaxing effect.",1485993600,12,935,4.441860465116279

6906305,3,B00R8HWMEU,It was pretty good but I prefer her to explain each move. It's supposed to be a DVD for beginners but each step is not explained. Beginners means we don't know any of the Yoga terms. I have some experience with yoga so I did know some of thevYoga terms but there were some that she mentioned that I didn't understand so I had to keep looking at the DVD.

6906310,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I sensed that as I've made my way through my 50's that flexibility has reduced, especially through the hips and shoulders. And that just doesn't do wonders for the golf swing.

Jessica provides two 30-minute sessions, energizing flow and relaxing flow. Energizing flow is the more quickly paced of the two - not quite a cardio workout, but I'm breathing pretty deeply by the end. It's a great workout to start the day. I actually do the relaxing flow more - plenty of stretching, but this one is designed to shake off (literally) the stresses of the day. By the end, your muscles are warm and you're ready to enjoy the evening.

Both sessions are suitable for a beginner like me (IMHO), as Jessica gives the ""easy"" option, and then usually a deeper stretch once you've mastered basic. I started with the beginner stuff at first, but I'm happy that I've progressed to at least the next level in several poses.

6906353,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I tried a yoga class several years ago and loathed it entirely. I have severe ADHD and a high stress job and I just could not get my brain to turn off. I found the whole exercise mentally exhausting and I had zero interest in trying again. I'm currently in the middle of a year long weight loss plan to lose 100 pounds [25 pounds down, y'all!] and needed a workout to improve my flexibility and strengthen my core, while being low impact. A friend recommended yoga. I laughed at her and then saw her results and shut my mouth. The added bonus to yoga was that it was supposed to help with my stress level - which my friends all agreed was a bit too high - and, although my last experience was not pleasant, I begrudgingly agreed to try it again. I had no interest in participating in a class again and looking like an uncoordinated spastic pigeon in front of other people, so I thought it would be best to find a DVD so I could do all the funny positions in the privacy of my own living room. [Happy baby pose... really?!?! The only person who needs to see me like that is my gynecologist.] I read dozens of reviews and found that the reviews for Jessica Smith were very much what I was looking for - calming voice, nice music, no chanting, attainable poses, etc. I bought this DVD and an accompanying Jessica DVD that was more advanced [I'm an overachiever, what can I say?]

It took me several days to work up the courage to even try my first workout [Did I mention I REALLY hated it last time?]. I started with the relaxation option on the Beginners and Beyond DVD. It started off fairly easy and advanced as the DVD went along. I felt a little stupid with my booty in the air and my shoulders twisted on the mat but I felt it working and so I pushed through. I survived with no bodily injuries and felt incredible afterwards. I was so relaxed by the end I couldn't believe thirty minutes had really passed. The stretches were difficult to start [I'm not the tiniest person in the world and my muscles have never stretched that way] but she found a way to add modifications that I found very helpful and possible. The next day I was sore but in a very good way. I could tell I had used muscles I don't usually utilize.

Speaking of the next day, I had an emergency at work - think community-wide PR nightmare. It was one of the most stressful days EVER. Previously I would turn to chocolate and eat my feelings but all day I found myself thinking about getting home to do yoga. ""WHAT?!?!"" my brain could not comprehend such nonsense. I even commented to a friend how bizarre it was that after one day it was all I could think about. So, I went home and did it again. During my second attempt I was able to see improvement in my stretches and felt myself gaining better balance and body awareness. I felt all kinds of gooey inside when I finished. I literally sat in the floor for ten minutes and couldn't believe how much better I felt after just two sessions. Then I went to bed and absolutely melted into my pillows. I slept better than I have in months. This all may sound like an exaggeration but it's absolutely true.

I'm hooked. I think I officially have to call myself a yogi now. I cannot wait to go home and do my yoga again tonight! [Life goal: do a handstand! I totally think I'll eventually get there if I keep going!]

I will absolutely continue using Jessica Smith's products and recommend them to anyone who is starting out and feels a little bit too chunky or uncoordinated for yoga. You're not! I promise! So what if your fat rolls keep you from reaching your toes! Mine do, but the whole point is reaching for those toes in the first place!  In fact, I have a feeling these DVDs will never become ""too easy"" as there is always room for improvements and harder modifications - no matter how thin and coordinated you become!

Namaste!",1470096000,298,3854,4.323651452282157
6906392,4,B00R8HWMEU,"So far so good. I am an older guy and I play a lot of soccer, so I am trying to improve my flexibility and balance. I took up yoga about a month ago, and go to a local facility about 3 times a week.

These videos are a good supplement to those yoga classes. There are many poses that you can do, but, like taking yoga classes, these videos help me do the poses in a specific order. I know I would not be doing yoga consistently if I didn't use the videos or take the classes.

So far, I like doing the morning video at the beginning of each day. It helps my body loosen up and prepare me for the day.

Jessica is very helpful about providing directions on how to get into the poses.

Recommend. :)",1469836800,4,697,3.9571428571428573

I started yoga about 14 years ago and used to go to the gym for classes. A live instructor is great, but this DVD is just as good! The AM energizing section is good for beginners as well as someone who wants more challenge with the modifications Jessica provides. Relaxation is my favorite part of yoga and the PM part is really great for flexibility for all levels too. Try it: you'll like it!",1469577600,,546,4.11214953271028

If you're really into yoga this might be a bit light-weight for you, but for people just looking for a way to gain a bit of flexibility and relaxation it's perfect.

6906453,5,B00R8HWMEU,"With a full-time sitting and typing job my hips and wrists are really tight at the end of my day and I've incorporated yoga or stretching DVDs into my routine for about the past 2-3 years. This DVD has really helped to counter balance some the issues with my hips, lower back and posture.

The instructor is very pleasant and I enjoy the way she explains each movement and breaks it down so someone with my lack of flexibility can still get into the movement.  It has been my experience that so many other instructors online and with DVDs are helpful but they don't really provide modifications for those with less mobility/flexibility.  This DVD fit the bill for me.  I notice I tend to reach for it 2-3 times per week over all my other DVDs.  Since I strength train 3-4 days per week, with the PM yoga stretch, I can really feel my muscles stretch and sometimes alleviate the DOMS or lactic acid which has built up in my muscles.  I have enjoyed it so much over the past weeks that I purchased for a friend.  I also enjoy the AM energizing practice.  It really wakes up the muscles and truly energizes the mind and body.",1466294400,,1122,4.386473429951691

I have the 15 Minute Fast Fat Blasts, the 21 Day Weight Loss Plan, and the 10,000 Steps Weight Loss DVDs, as well as her Stretching DVD and Total Body Balance DVD.  It is great for me, as I have found it is good to take a break from the jumping up and down on some of my other DVDs.  My knees would ache by the end of the evening after a workout.  Sometimes even an Epsom salt bath did not seem to help my soreness.  Coupling the walking DVDs with the stretching DVD, I have moved these DVDs to the top of my workout regimen. Jessica gives you a real workout without placing a lot of stress on your knees.  Sometimes I don't even feel like Im exercising, as I am having more fun again.

I bought it to accompany the Six Weeks Transformation DVD set for Phase II.  So far, I've only done the AM segment - will do the PM one this week.  It was a learning curve, for sure, because I found it difficult at times to figure out what Jessica was doing and do it myself before she changed to something else but that should be easier the next time.

So I checked a few of her videos on YouTube to see how strenuous her workouts might be as I have bad knees. I liked what I saw so I purchased a couple of her videos here at Amazon. Before I ever received my videos I got an email from Jessica thanking me for my purchase and offering her assistance if I had any questions. She wanted to ensure I was completely satisfied with my purchase. Then after I received my videos I got another email from her offering some tips and again making herself available if I had any questions or concerns. I love the fact that she seems genuine in her commitment to helping people. I've only had the video a couple days but am very happy with my purchase.

There are definitely moves I can't do- may never be able to do?? But I will keep trying. It helps a lot that my husband will do it with me. He keeps me motivated.

I love it! The energizing flow is actually a pretty good workout for me - I definitely work up a little bit of a sweat during the middle of it and I can certainly feel it particularly in my abs, but it's also a really nice stretch and a good way to start the day. The relaxing flow is great at the end of a long day of work or if I have gotten in a really long walk or workout earlier in the day. It's a really great stretch to help wind down!",1457222400,,637,3.984375

The stretches and poses feel like a real workout, and the setting and music is beautiful and soothing. After trying both workouts, I've been able to actually sleep through the night, because I feel like my stress level is already down. I believe it's because I'm treating my body to these great Yoga sessions. They are quick too--only 30 minutes each! Thanks to Jessica!",1456444800,,527,4.739130434782608
6906616,5,B00R8HWMEU,I bought this to do with my husband who is a busy and stressed out doctor. I too was needing some relaxation after busy days with my two young children. We have enjoyed doing the pm stretch as a way of winding down after our long days. I have also enjoyed the morning stretch which has helped me start the day on a more positive note. All together this DVD is exactly what I was hoping it would be! Wonderful product!,1456358400,2,417,4.160493827160494

As I'm aging, I'm understanding the importance of stretch and flexibility and am now incorporating this even more so into my exercise routine.  This video gives me two different options to accomplish that goal.  As usual, Jessica delivers a clearly explained, well queued, and enjoyable routine...twice.  Her positive energy is encouraging and motivating.  When used in conjunction with cardio and weight training, both videos help to create a more rounded overall exercise program that focuses on honoring your body and having a more mind, body, spirit exercise approach. I highly recommend this video!",1455926400,,642,5.444444444444445

I would love to take classes in person but my busy schedule and my love for naps (on the weekends) prevent me from doing so. The next best thing would be for me to get a dvd and then I can work out whenever it suits me. Previously I have purchase another ""beginners yoga"" dvd, but it turns out it really was for more advance yogis. Because of that experience, I really was hesitant to buy another yoga dvd. After moving up to the Midwest and gaining 10 pounds AND dealing with being stuck inside because of the cold, I started looking around for workout dvds. I came across Jessica Smith's and read the reviews and decided to take a leap of faith.  So far I have done a couple of sessions and I absolutely love it. It really is for beginners and beyond. I love the way she guides you through each move and pretty much everything about her.

My ability to exercise was limited by my back pain, and this DVD was SO helpful in helping me develop core strength and balance.  I still have pain issues, but they have been much improved by this yoga DVD. I had never done yoga before.  I was careful to modify my moves until I gained more mobility (a great feeling when that happens), and Jessica gives suggestions how to make the poses easier at first, until you can get more range of motion.  Now, I really look forward to this routine.  The instructions on breathing with the moves is very calming.  So, it calms while it energizes. I am so glad I found this DVD!",1453852800,4,712,4.315789473684211

I have tried countless forms, classes (private and group), and DVD's of Yoga and this is hands down the best one I've tried - particularly for beginners. Jessica has a soothing voice, isn't intimidating in her practice, explains every stretch and encourages you to only go as far as you can without pressure of trying to deepen the pose.  This is the first Yoga DVD that has successfully made me want to continue in the practice. I'm currently 48 years old, have always been very inflexible, and this DVD finally gives me hope that I can improve that flexibility in a gentle and balanced way without rushing anything.",1453680000,2,682,4.628099173553719

6906672,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I was actually trying to find a fitness video to kick-start my ""let's get healthy!"" campaign and was researching through Yoga lessons and came upon this one. I'm 100% new to the Yoga world but every review I read of your lesson seemed overwhelmingly positive, so I decided to give it a shot. Best decision ever! I'm probably the least flexible person in the world, but with your help, these stretches are becoming more bearable with each day. And it's actually pretty amazing how sore they're leaving me. I'm feeling pain in muscles I didn't even know existed, wow! It's a good pain though, it let's me know I'm making progress.

Your instructions are super easy to follow, so even someone with zero previous Yoga experience (me!) can follow along easily, especially since I can't always be looking at the screen when doing certain poses. I also appreciate that it's simple...there's no terminology thrown in that I'd be confused by which would force me to pause and search for it's meaning.

I would definitely recommend this video for anybody looking to pick up Yoga for the first time. Just don't forget the Yoga strap/towel, you're going to need it! :)",1452816000,3,1156,4.775

It's not strenuous, but I could feel my muscles working in the energizing patio of the DVD.

6906712,5,B00R8HWMEU,"Let me premise by saying that for many years I've been a big Leslie Sansone (Walk Away The Pounds) fan. The DVD I use the most of Sansone's is the Walk At Home 5 mile fat burning walk. She is an adorable woman, super upbeat, and the time goes quickly.
  Jessica Smith, on the other hand, is Leslie Sansone, caffeinated. Oh my goodness, I just looked her up and she is only 34 years old.
Anyway! She does her workouts at her parents' Sarasota Florida home. I think that's adorable. In this particular DVD, her Mom, along with a friend of Jessica's who is a latin dance teacher, join her in the workout. Jessica's mom does the least energetic version, Jessica does the ""normal"" version, and her amiga is the souped up one.
I did Fast Fat Burn (I almost wrote ""fart""... I think I did that too, LOL!!) and then the Dance Party.
The Fast Fat Burn is a workout! My pulse was up right away, and I am not a beginner exerciser. At first I'm like, ""Jessica, you're my girl. I'm not even gonna look at your mommy"" and then about halfway in I'm like, ""hello Mommy, my name is Sue! I'm your new work out buddy!"" At one point Jessica's mom seemed over it.
I totally understood, LOL.
  I got really sweaty, which I rarely get with the Sansone DVDs and I also love two things about Jessica. She's a beautiful girl but she is not interested in
showing off her body (she wears an oversized Gap t shirt and a pair of capri length gym pants) and she is also just ""a girl who you happen to be watching
and she is exercising"".  With Sansone (and really, I'm not meaning to trash talk her, just pointing out differences), she seems ""on stage"" and ""wanting to entertain"". Sometimes I even exercise without the sound on- she gets to be a bit much for me.
  At some points during the Fast Fat Burn and the Dance Party, With Dance Party (low key Zumba) I was about as uncoordinated as a three year old trying to do the Hokey Pokey at a wedding, LOL. At other times I felt as if I had put my forehead on the top of a baseball bat and went around and around to make myself dizzy, and then try to hit the ball. It was EMBARRASSING! But the great news is, I know for sure that the more I use the DVD, the more I will learn the steps and the less of a spazz I will become. That's the hope, at least!
  All this to say, Walk On 15 Minutes Fast Fat Blasts by Jessica Smith is a GREAT DVD. She has made a new fan in me. Maybe next time I can make it seem as if I actually have a right AND a left foot, instead of two left ones, LOL.",1440460800,,2497,4.069246435845214

I highly recommend Jessica Smith. Her workouts go by so quickly. The music she chose for this one was perfect.",1436486400,,269,4.625
6906718,5,B00R8HWMEU,"This video has two sessions that can be done in one day, one in the morning (or any time you need energy) and the other at night. The AM yoga session made me feel energized and the variations made it possible for a beginner like me to do it on a daily basis while challenging (not exhausting) themselves and progress nearly every day for weeks on end. I felt a sense of accomplishment when I was able to progress to a more challenging variation. I've made it to the advance version on some exercises but am still working on others. The PM session is not nearly as physically challenging, it focuses on more static stretch/lengthening exercises that helps both my body and mind feel calm and relaxed which made going to sleep so much easier. I highly recommend this video because of it's repeat-ability factor. There are some where I get tired of watching it after the first few times either because of the exercises or the commentary. But this still leaves me feeling energized in the morning and relaxed at night. I'll tell you right now there are days when you'll regress and have to stick to a lower variation or just be able to do one of the sessions but instead of tapering down to nothing. I'm always wanting to get back to the full swing as soon as I am able because it makes me feel better.",1436140800,7,1298,4.4125

6906745,5,B00R8HWMEU,"First of all, I love yoga already. But, these 2 routines really help stretch out tension and Jessica gives you time to really breathe into the stretch - which I have found to be annoying with other instructors when they rush to the next move. The energizing flow is perfect to get you moving in the morning or for those days when you're feeling sluggish. It didn't feel like a workout at all but I was actually a little sore the next day from this workout and I would like to consider myself in shape. The relaxing flow is really nice if you want a good stretching session. In the past, I never took the time to stretch or focus on my flexibility, but now it's a part of my routine. The stretches feel nice and if you hold tension in your muscles this is a good way to let it go. When I'm stressed, I tend to get tension headaches and back pain from my tight muscles... these workouts help! I highly recommend. My only suggestion is that I wish there were more routines on this DVD. Otherwise, it's great.",1431043200,10,1005,4.267015706806283

I do enjoy Jessica's Barre DVD and her 10 pounds down Total Body Tune Up is 1 of my top several dvds(I have quite a few!)The scenery in this is very pretty,but so is in her Barre workout and that one I enjoy. I've really never been a fan of Yoga so I think it's just my opinion that this isn't great. The only Yoga style dvd's I like are Warrior&Release by Suzanne Bowen&Leah Sarego-they are relaxing,but also make me feel toned&stretched out",1428969600,5,651,4.433333333333334
6906748,5,B00R8HWMEU,"Perfect yoga workout. Other classes I've taken do the same moves over and over, such as downward facing dog and forward folds---30 plus in one class. I would love for Jessica to do an additional yoga/Pilates DVD.",1428192000,2,212,4.756756756756757
6906759,5,B00R8HWMEU,Love this. Everything is doable and it great to start the day. Love the evening stretch. I work a very physical job and the stretches feel sooo good. I  love all of Jessica's workouts. I started with her YouTube ones and have bought every DVD she's come out with. Worth every penny!,1427587200,3,282,4.423076923076923
6906760,5,B00R8HWMEU,Very easy on the body but gets the job done.,1427241600,3,44,3.5
6906761,5,B00R8HWMEU,Highly recommend,1426636800,,16,7.5
6906762,5,B00R8HWMEU,Another great fitness DVD by Jessica Smith.  I think I own them all now.,1426636800,,72,4.142857142857143
6906763,5,B00R8HWMEU,I absolutely love this yoga dvd. It is wonderful for beginners :-),1426118400,,66,4.583333333333333
6906764,5,B00R8HWMEU,"So I like this DVD for beginners. She doesn't move too quickly and gives you plenty of modifications if you can't quite get into all the poses just yet as well as gives you more advanced moves if you think you're ready for a challenge. The only drawback, at least for me, is I do wish she would sell this as two separate DVDs. I LOVE the relaxation stretches so much more than I like the energizing ones...and to be honest, I would rather just have the relaxation stretches than keep the energy part. But, all things considered...that's not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I still have the relaxation stuff in the end. LOL.

Overall, I would recommend this to someone who is beginning. I think it's easy enough to do.",1426032000,14,734,4.397058823529412
6906765,5,B00R8HWMEU,"This is a wonderful addition to my collection of Jessica Smith DVDs.  Jessica is incredibly motivating and I love working out with her everyday.  She is simply AWESOME.

By the way, I am in my mid-50's and love the high impact, but do-able, routines in her walking DVDs.  I enjoy yoga stretches on my ""down"" day (Sunday).  Exercise keeps me looking young.  Though I qualify for age 55 and over discounts, I just love it when I'm asked to show proof of my age!",1425686400,5,459,4.404761904761905
6906766,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I really enjoy doing Yoga Stretch. I have back problems and was told by my doctor to do Yoga. These stretches are great!!. There's no weird positions,  no weird language. It's just simple, easy and very calming. Jessica Smith is an excellent instructor. I have a lot of her other DVD'S. Since I found out about the differrnt problems in my spine and have gained some weight because of it...I have found doing this DVD and her 21 day DVD'S is helping me to get back in shape!!! Love it!!",1425427200,10,486,4.4
6906767,4,B00R8HWMEU,For a beginner over 50 the Energizing routine is great. I sit at a desk all day and if feels great after a long day. She is very easy to follow. The other routine I find very difficult.,1425254400,9,185,3.8947368421052633
6906768,5,B00R8HWMEU,I never thought relaxing could be so energizing. Or vice versa!,1424822400,,63,4.818181818181818
8694510,5,B00R8HWMEU,Jessica Smith is so relaxing and encouraging in this beginners video for yoga. She gives great instruction in a relaxing manner and background in the video. The moves are altered for beginners or you can make them more difficult if you're ready. This was my first into to yoga and it has definitely helped me tone and my back pain.,1534464000,,331,4.533333333333333
8694511,5,B00R8HWMEU,"Great series with nice instruction.  Instructor's voice is normal, not like so many sing songy yogis.  Yoga buffs and non-yoga folks will both like this DVD.",1533772800,,157,5.0
8694512,5,B00R8HWMEU,Highly recommend purchasing this video if you're new to yoga. Its easy to follow and the modifications are great.,1533686400,,113,5.0
8694513,5,B00R8HWMEU,I have never thought yoga could be helpful. This is an awesome DVD. She shows you how to go from beginner to intermediate to more advanced without making you feel inferior. It feels amazing & there are two versions. Both great for toning the body.,1532563200,,247,4.511111111111111
8694514,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I have been sedentary for 10 years, and I am about 60 pounds overweight. I have been using this dvd for 3-4 times per week for the past month, and I cannot even begin to tell you how different I feel! I have lost about 8 pounds, but I feel so much stronger doing these moves. Jessica Smith (instructor) is legit! Wish I had tried yoga years ago...it freaking rocks.",1532131200,,365,4.228571428571429
8694515,5,B00R8HWMEU,First Yoga DVD that I actually enjoyed!  A great place to start for beginners.,1531267200,,78,4.571428571428571

8694518,2,B00R8HWMEU,If you are just starting to exercise this is NOT the video for you.,1530748800,,67,3.857142857142857
8694519,5,B00R8HWMEU,"I love this workout!  I have had back problems for a while from recovering from a slipped disc in my lower spine.  So many of the yoga poses/stretches in this video were ones I did in physical therapy for my spine.  The energizing workout is a wonderful way to start the day.  With some muscle aches and pains in my back when I first wake up, after stretching first thing with the energizing workout, my back feels amazing.  The relaxing workout at the end of the day is so great to relax from a stressful day and breathe out all anxiety for a restful evening.  The instructor moves slow enough for proper stretching and for those not used to yoga.  Highly recommend this video!",1530748800,,678,4.419354838709677
