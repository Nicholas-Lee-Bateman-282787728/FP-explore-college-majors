211484,5,6300145786,"I've owned this movie on VHS since I was young, and have watched it over a hundred times, at least.  This movie is one of the most amazing films to come out of the 80's . . . It's got drama, comedy (See, Tim here races for Coke!), phatty BMX racing, and a killer soundtrack.  And a young Lori Loughlin, not to mention a more seasoned Talia Shire as Cru's mom.  One of my most prized possessions, and one of my favorite movies of all time, RAD is a definite ""must-see.""",983836800,10,468,4.1208791208791204

211486,5,6300145786,"Man, I must have had my mom rent this movie at least 20 times. It shows its age now, but it aged well.  The 80's music is awesome for 80s rock. The bike action is great, the actors are believeable in their rolls.  Of course the good guy wins at the end despite all odds. Makes me long for the days when we were the good guys and the soviets were the bad guys.  Simpler times, simply great movie.  If they put it on DVD i'll think about buying it. BTW I rarely give 5 stars.",980121600,,473,3.8958333333333335
211487,5,6300145786,"""Rad"" is, by far, my favorite movie of this particular genre (bmx racing with your basic good-kid underdogs vs. rich talented snobs plot).  Though it probably won't keep you on the edge of your seat, you will definitely find yourself rooting for the main character Crew Jones, both on the bmx track and in regard to his new love interest, a fellow bmx'er whom Crew meets when an exhibition bmx team comes to his small town.  Crew truly is, as one of the characters in the movie states, ""such a nice boy.""  Coupled with his raw talent and youthful exuberance, one can't help but pull for the youngster.  The bmx-riding footage in this movie is amazing, and although the plot is predictable, this movie is a true FGM (Feel Good Movie) and is a must-see for anyone who was or is interested in bmx riding.",978480000,3,801,4.503448275862069
211488,5,6300145786,"Rad is Rad! This movie has to be one of the greatest films to come out of the last century. If you were a kid in 1986, you saw this movie. You saw it alot. Because everyone who was a kid in 1986 rented Rad everytime your babysitter took you to the videostore. Rad is the best!",978393600,2,276,3.8596491228070176

211549,5,6300145786,I thought about this purchase for like 3 weeks. I was nervous because this movie has never been released on DVD. I really loved this movie and desperately wanted to watch it. There was nowhere else to go. So I bought it and i am so happy I did it! I wish i would've ordered sooner. The movie quality was great for an 80s movie. I've already watched it like 5 times.

With VHS being extinct, I never thought I would be able to watch again. This DVD quality is amazing! I'm watching on Samsung 4K and it looks great. Colors really pop for an older movie. Audio was much better than expected, so you can really crank up ""Break the Ice"" in the opening montage. Its Cherry Pickers and Miami Hoppers once again!",1490659200,2,472,4.2555555555555555

I'd also like to point out that the cover is printed from a home printer on cardstock not the glossy paper the DVDs come with.
The disc has JVC made in Japan stamped on it, while it feels like a sticker on the disc.

Update. I have since found out that the original copyright holder went out of business so this is something that's free market and not bootlegged although my copy was not working the seller did send me another copy and refund my money for my inconvenience. The new copy sounds it go up and down a little bit but it was perfectly watchable and a great trip down memory lane!",1483574400,2,756,4.178082191780822

Welcome to the birth of extreme sports!!!!!!!!!!! Has a fantastic sound track. its exciting to see Cru at that age of growing up becoming a man, having to make decisions on his future, his career, life, and love, listening to advice from family and friends, and finally making his own decisions. The bullies were cool too. I NEVER forgot how at the end, Cru and the Bully both helped each other. That is so awesome to see people like that Becoming friends. TOTALLY COOL!

211934,4,6300145786,"Let's be honest, Rad never officially came out on DVD whichever essentially makes this a bootleg copy. If we were going off of display quality alone this movie would receive 1 star. However, if you are like me you are purchasing this for the memories that comes with the movie bringing the much higher weighted nostalgia score of 5 stars. when it is all said and done I now have the ability to watch Rad once again which fulfills my expectations of this purchase, leaving us with a 4 star rating.",1468972800,5,496,4.461538461538462

212000,5,6300145786,"My favorite movie while growing up! I remember when I first saw this movie I was all fired up! There was thunder in my heart and every move was like lightning! Well I never had RAD moves and the only thunder that came was after eating at Taco Bell. I heard that this movie didn't do to good in the theater but when it came out for rent it was the #1 rental making it a cult classic. I love everything RAD! I bought the Bill Allen book My RAD Career and the RAD soundtrack cd (unofficial, soundtrack only came out in vinyl record and cassette tape form) from amazon. I didn't get the RAD racing red t-shirt yet. I wish they made this movie into a DVD already. I bought 3 copies from amazon in VHS form in its original box! So I have like 4 copies all together. The book is very interesting and informative if you are a RAD fan. My favorite bike has to be the GT Performer. I probably watched this movie like a 100 times. Great movie! Even when I was young I knew some stunts the dude was wearing a wig and chick clothes so I knew not to be a pirate and check out that bootie. Great movie even just to have a heartwarming feeling and that you can do it attitude is worth it. I love it when Cru goes to the dance and does some bicycle boogie boarder. Those spokes shine so much! Bling bling! A$$ sliding is cool too. RAD is only available on VHS. This DVD is the best copy I ever saw! It is very clear. I have a DVD that was transferred a while back from VHS and its a little better than the VHS. But this copy is very clear and nicely done. I can tell it was made very well because in the very beginning when cru is delivering news papers, the clouds and sky are a red color and weird blurry colors. In this dvd copy the clouds are a normal color and clear. Even the vhs copies are blurry and discolored. i bought the vhs version for the collector in me with the original box and I do not watch them. You will be happy with this copy. just don't expect super crystal clear 4K blue-ray hd. Instead expect a dvd quality close to production made. So I got quite a collection of RAD VHS because I'v got a hunch that at the end of this race they're going to be mighty valuable. Don't be left out! I'd run right over to that stand and buy as many as you can!",1406419200,,2250,4.013363028953229

The disc itself is printed and not just a sticker so it's definitely legit. The picture quality was solid for a low budget 80's b movie cult classic. The sound was good too. There is a small logo in the right corner through out the movie implying what your watching Is HD but if it's not filmed in hd it will never have that quality. The sound was also good for such an old movie that doesn't have a billion dollar company like Disney to "" digitally remaster""  it.

The movie was probably recorded directly from television, because the bottom right corner had some kind of HDTV logo for a channel or something. My copy also came in a 2-disc set that included the movie soundtrack, which was a bonus since the music is AWESOME. Overall I'm glad to have a copy of this rare film, even though it's obviously not an official release.",1387929600,2,462,4.716049382716049
212102,5,6300145786,"Yes, finaly! Lets first talk about this physical product the DVD, and then the movie itself. No extras, only the movie in a decent VHS-rip quality. The disc has the purple color of low budget copies, artwork of the cover is bad. But it has no weight in the over-all value of this item. It is a low budget release from Australia, but that doesn't mean the movie is bad or out of time. It is a cult movie giving alot to people thinking alternatively but maybe not to the masses. Me and my friends watched this movie over and over when going in high school, along with other independent cult classics from the 80's. RAD reminded me of a perfect childhood, when things got more complex in high school and the years after, with girls, motor cars, beer. RAD had the easy fix solutions, and it got me and my two friends to buy bmx bikes of our own, playing around with at this time. This is the perfect time-machine back to the mid 80's. The movie's about giving the small town boy (me/you) a chance to reach the stars, by not giving up and rely on your talent. It was very inspirational for us ""Euro trashers"", getting us off the couches and on our feet, and even onto small funny looking bikes for a short while. The hero, Cru Jones, is definitely a fix star of inspiration for me even today; the movie givers the same feeling today. Get this flick, before it is too late. The soundtrack is great too, pitching at the track ""Send me an angel"" when the hero and heroine dances with their bmx bikes at the high school prom!!!",1387929600,,1518,4.311188811188811

You all need to know that RAD has NEVER been officially released on DVD, therefore you ARE NOT buying an official DVD copy of the movie. There are countless numbers of petitions to do so, but the fact of the matter is, whoever currently holds the rights to the movie doesn't seem to realize how much a DVD release of RAD could make.

With that said, what is for sale here is essentially a home-made VHS transfer of the film that has been burned to a DVD. Plain and simple. The DVD cover art is fake and made up as well, just based on the VHS cover art. If you are REALLY a big fan of RAD, and you have an HDTV with HD cable/satellite service, then check out the channel lineup of HDNET Movies.

He had more than 15 trophies, although I can't remember the exact amount now.  I do remember that the day after we first saw Rad, he won another local race and credited the movie for inspiring him.  This movie is one of the best for inspiration and the scene in the dance club with Bill Allen and Lori Loughlin doing the bike stunts and Send Me An Angel playing gives me goosebumps to this day.

People wore pastel colored sport jackets over T-shirts. And the Beastie Boys were telling us we had to fight for our right to party. I'd snap this DVD up in a second.,1182384000,,345,4.242424242424242
212327,5,6300145786,"I was able to find a `Rad' DVD online, which I'm fairly certain is a pirated copy (subtle hints, such as the DVD itself still saying `Maxell').  Fortunately, I am not a DVD collector by any means.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to rent this gem of a film anywhere.

As a veteran BMXer and a thirty-something who still enjoys doing very stupid things on bikes, I absolutely love this movie.  I'm pretty sure some of my older and more faded scars are a direct result of attempting to emulate the great Cru Jones, a feat that was impossible for me at age 12, and will be at this age as well.  The refreshing thing is that back when `Rad' was made, moviegoers were less concerned about how much a production company might be sued for.  They did not need to show that Cru wore a helmet, in fact, while learning to back flip (incorrectly called `Airwalk' by a young and ever so compelling Lori Laughlin), we see Cru wearing a hockey goalie mask.  My fellow freeriders (a style of mountain biking) can attest to the fact that this would be pure suicide.  Law suits?  None that I remember.

So that is what makes `Rad' so rad?  A 90 minute trip back to slightly simpler time.  A day when surfing was done with a board and not a computer.  A time when computers were more about tic-tac-toe (and thermal global nuclear war) than about work.  A time when kids could truly believe they had a shot at winning the big race.  A time when kids were more interested in winning the big race than they were in landing a dream-sponsorship.  A time when violence was not needed to compensate for a worthless plot.  Best yet, a time when a girl like Lori Laughlin could be wooed by the sharing of an ice cream cone.  Remember, she wouldn't be able to call you until she got home or came across a payphone.

I suppose this has become more of a rant than a review, but the feeling of being a kid again is more what `Rad' is about than a cheesy storyline and some impressive (even by today's standards) biking.  In the interest of review, I should make note that the movie scores EXTREMELY low on the 80's cheese factor, especially for a sports movie.  No montage, no evil jock named `Stalin', very little in the way of the hero's internal struggle with (un)popularity.  Ok, maybe the Mongoose team's choreographed yet impromptu dance routine (especially with twin men in matching sleeveless suits) was a bit much.  Point is, the movie itself is good; you'll spend (a LOT) more time reminiscing and enjoying the story than you will laughing at bright shoelaces and parachute pants.

Whether you are a child of the 80's or a child now, `Rad' will make you smile.  Just don't try too hard to learn the freestyle tricks from the movie.  I doubt the producer/distributor could be held liable for your injuries 25 years after the fact.",1175731200,10,2809,4.469548133595285

What I personally liked about the movie was that it had a decent storyline, some good acting (and some bad) but mainly, it was a feel good movie that is fun and clean. Add a dash of romance, some witty humour and a character showing that passion and believing is the greatest power.

I enjoyed watching it again and again. While there are alot of movies that are based around a sport and shamelessly push it from every angle, this is not so with 'Rad'. It is overflowing with BMX and the more you see, the more you want.",1173484800,3,592,4.184210526315789

This movie RAD was THEE best BMX movie of ALL time. You can even catch some of the gliches in the movie, the way it was pieced together, lol, but its still great. And you got a hot young lori loughlin in it to boot. you must see this if you havent. for the most part it is pretty much a TIMELESS work of art. It is actually quite amazing to see how much bmx, and all that stuff has progresses in the last 20 years with the X games, and all that.

I only wish for 2 things for anyone who reads this that knows any big shots.

1. we ALL want RAD on DVD! it would sell big time

and

2. Make a RAD 2 !  20 years later with a similiar updated story, it would rock!

It has been over a decade since I have seen it, but I can specificaly remember the scene at the school dance where they ride their bikes on the gym floor to the theme song ""Send me an Angel"".  I was actually able to find this song (bootlegged) on Napster in college back when music was still free.  I also remember the final scene when the main character actually stops and waits for his adversary on this insane BMX course full of lethal pits and what not.  RAD is on up there with The Goonies and Flight of the Navigator.

Yet even when I was 13, it didn't make a lot of sense to me.  What kind of race were they in?  Were they trying to do more tricks, go faster, etc?  It was sort of a weird combo freestyle/racing course that does not really exist (or it did not then) in ""professional"" BMXing.  It was clearly an attempt to hybrid these two distinct BMX bike disciplines.  But would you combine soccer and football to make a movie?  Or cricket and baseball?

Not only that, the story is just plain corny - probably like many movies of its time and genre.  I will agree that for those interested in that biking, it was a fun film.

Above all, the opening and closing credits - real freestyling, is fantastic with catchy music.  I would happily watch it even now.

Yes, it doesn't have the drama or special effects we have today.  But, it has that whole ""Rocky"" underdog feel to it, that captures your attention and allows itself to achieve that timeless masterpiece quality.

212459,5,6300145786,"What this movie does to me I can not explain. Whether it be the almost 80's soundtrack or the amazing BMX mastership of Crew Jones or maybe the tight body of Bart Taylor, I can not even begin to describe the amazing power of RAD. This movie is great for some many different reasons. Like the time when Crew and his babe go ... sliding...I almost jerked a tear. Or how about when we see the dramatic scene with Crew all by himself in his little hideout near the lumber yard. I really felt the pain he was going through. Or how about qualifying for Hell Track? Those series of races in combination with the radical music really inspired me to get a BMX bike. That brings up the only complaint that I have... WHY IN ... TRACK ISNT THE SOUNDTRACK AVAILABLE. How is it possible?! It has to be a crime. I would love nothing more than to ride my bike and listen to the tunes of RAD. They really pump me up you know. Anyway, there is only one RAD and you should watch it over and over and over if you are really cool like homestarrunner.com.",1027468800,13,1033,4.1959798994974875
212460,5,6300145786,"This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood. Does anything personify the 80's better than BMX and the Scorpions? I think not. This movie MUST be put out on DVD, as my copy on VHS will soon be unrecognizable.",1026345600,,215,4.2682926829268295
212461,5,6300145786,"Basically, classics like Rad- The Goonies, The North Shore, Breakin', Star Wars, Return of the Dragon, etc. should go down in history as some of Hollywood's best work. Out of this illustrious group, Rad in particular has etched an idelible place in my heart. There is nothing more beautiful than watching Crew deliver the paper, spin 360s out of backyard pools, ...disco dance on his bike and take down hell track. It just makes me sad that I'm relegated to watching this cinematic masterpiece from a dilapidated VHS tape that's been 'fixed' a few too many times.
I also find it disheartening that the vast majority of kids born after 1980 don't even know what Rad is- unless they've had a really cool older brother/sister showing them what's up. And by the way, ignorance is no excuse...such a shame.
It's time for those with a keen eye for the cinematic aesthetic and way too much time on our hands to stand up, remove the matresses from the ramp and demand Rad be saved for those less fortunate than us...Rad is a dope movie that I wish everybody could watch- and don't even get me started about the soundtrack. Try tracking down a copy of Rad and protect it with your life...",1020902400,63,1179,4.592417061611374
212462,5,6300145786,"Rad is a movie unto itself. It perfectly personifies the 80's through a spirited young BMXer. With many movies being rereleased onto DVD, old classics are revived for the children of the 80's to relive their childhood and for younger children of this century to see what life was like then. Rad shows us what time was like then almost perfectly. Go RAD!! Rerelease it on DVD!! It's a classic!!",1019606400,,393,4.628571428571429

From the clothing,the dialogue, and music, no other movie could ever portray what eighties BMX riding was all about. I look to it as just as good of an 80's icon as The Goonies.

212466,5,6300145786,Well i First watched this movie when i was 4 or 5yrs. old and i am 19yrs. old now so after fifteen yrs. i still have my copy of the movie and will probably never let it go cause it was a big part of my childhood and i think that this movie is what being a kid was all about.  This movie will last the test of time and anyone who watched this movie can agree with me there.  So in Conclusion just go ...-slidin and have a Rad Time cause life is to short to not have fun and thats just what this movie is all about and it also teaches valuable life lessons.,1011052800,3,555,3.7758620689655173

Its funny, great biking, and never a dull part, probably one of the best endings, too.  After 15 years i still remember the bike dancing in the gym with ""Send me an Angel,"" and never will forget it.. every time i went to rent the movies i would get RAD and a few others, and wouldn't even watch the other movies.  I never really thought to buy it until now, and not really surprised to see the price at $60.  Most definatly the greatest movie for me growing up, and now i miss it.",1002758400,6,612,4.1525423728813555
212469,5,6300145786,"Is big business the real enemy? Did the seemingly prosperous economic climate of the 1980's really happen for any one but the fat cat rich? Did Trickle Down economics have the effect on the blue collar workers of the decade that it had intended to? Hal Needham shouts an emphatic ""NO"" with this scathing condemnation of the American Financial system thinly veiled under a simple story of a home town boy, Cru Jones (Bill Allen, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY) from Anywhere, U.S.A. just trying to literally ride with the big boys and make a name for himself in just about the most simple, American way possible; Cru rides a bicycle. Duke Best, a typically sleezy business man is trying to corrupt Cru with the promise of the all mighty dollar. When he refuses the temptations Cru and his friends must overcome the moral and, primarily financial obsticals that Best erects in their way. RAD is less a sports movie than an allegory of a small man raising up from nothing to take on spectre of big business, coming back from every test like Phoenix from the ashes, to overcome, to fight back, to win.
We can even look at the title: RAD, short for radical. To the layman's eyes it would seem to be just some slang for cool or boss. But to the eyes of the elect it is a reference to the lead character. Cru is staring everything that the American industrial complex of the '80s held dear in the eye and saying in a strong convicted voice ""I will not lay down. I will not go quietly. The status quo is a no no!"" Cru Jones was to movies that Bruce Springsteen was to music. He quite like James Dean, however Cru does have a cause. It is the total subversion of the power that Alexis de Touqeville called America's aristocracy, the business ruling class, and he does it with the only mean available to him; sheer determination. The kind of determination only found in romantics with unrequited love and men with nothing to loose but everything to gain. Nothing would deter this jugernaut force that once set in motion, would never stop; not for petty squabbles with rivals, finacial subjegation, or lovers quarrels. Not for SATs, angry mothers, or an occational injustice. Cru had to, at all costs, rebel against the unwritten laws of big business because they have no place in the American heart or heartland, and could not stand idly by and watch what he knew to be rightfully his ride by, like a wheely in a parade.
But is that all there is to this film?  Is Cru just epitome of the little man, the every man who won't back down?  Or is there more?  Does this film provide more than just an inspirational folktale, designed to warn the people of the evils of money? Is Cru a 1980's Jesus figure? A symbol of history's penultimate radical? A young man from humble beginings who becomes a hero and an inspiration to all, creating a movement of disciples, and, in the end, recruting one of his biggest rivals to the cause. And it is done on a road none the less. Lori Laughlin= Mary Magdolin? Talia Shire= Mary the blessed virgin? Would Duke Best be the embodiment of the lord of the netherworld himself? Ray Walston the benevolent hand of God, guiding Cru through the wilderness?
No, this film is much more than a simple sports movie. It is a labyrinth of Borgesian proportions that cannot be unraveled by anything less than the sharpest of intellects. If you step inside the inner workings of Halneedham's masterpiece do not be suprised to find the exit is far more elusive then one would like to believe. Give the man his due, he created one of the only pieces of truth on film that came out of 1986. Hal Needham really did send me an Angel.",1000944000,11,3632,4.491679273827534
