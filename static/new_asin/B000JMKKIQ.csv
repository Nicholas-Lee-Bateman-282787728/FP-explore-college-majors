2678294,1,B000JMKKIQ,"This is an impossibly bad movie and a complete waste of your time. Avoid it. I originally thought that with Caine this it might be worthwhile but that's not the case.
The plot is a straightforward armored car heist. However terrible plot devices, terrible child actors, terrible editing and confusing continuity all conspire to ruin any entertainment value. I don't have the faintest idea why Caine lowered himself to act in this garbage.",1488499200,7,438,5.013698630136986

2678296,2,B000JMKKIQ,"Upfront, I'll admit that I've only watched about half this movie (till the mock trial of the schoolgirl) until I shut it off.  There are two story lines running throughout the film, one having to do with a planned heist of a van carrying special blank paper from the government mint used in currency production, and the other involving a social outcast boy at a private school.  The storylines have almost nothing to do with each other (at least till the half way point where I stopped) and the child acting is bad.

I usually love espionage and gangster movies, but I would not recommend this film to others.",1300406400,,609,4.568807339449541
2678297,2,B000JMKKIQ,"I am a great admirer of the work of British actors, James Fox and Caine.
Michael Caine had appeared in a great many movies which he should have thought twice about before signing the contract. This is one of those movies.
Caine does his old Cockney ganster bit which he developed in the original version of the ITALIAN JOB.In this one he turns ruthless,rather like a simular character he played in the classic British ganster film, MONA LISA. But it's just not working well here for him.

In additon to the grand heist theme of the movie, there's a poorly developed sub-plot concerning a nerdy English public school boy, who finds out about the heist and keeps encountering the plotters.

One of my favorite British actors, James Fox, is also wasting his time here as a corrupt Upper Class civil servant( roles which he plays so well).
Fox who started his career as a child actor ,has been making movies for over 50 years. He like Michael Caine, has made some very good one and some rather bad ones, this film being one of the latter.

The poorly written script stretches credulity to limit and there is far too much gratuitous violence to be justtified by the story .

 I found the movie over all to be very  disappointing.",1269993600,6,1224,4.566210045662101
2678298,4,B000JMKKIQ,"""Shadow Run"" isn't a great crime film on the order of ""Get Carter"" or ""The Long Good Friday,"" but it is an enjoyable enough tale of a heist gone wrong. The great pleasure of the film is, of course, Michael Caine, one of the few actors who can be equally effective as good guy or bad. Here, he plays Haskell, a very bad man who's teamed up with an even badder man to loot a vanload of banknote paper. What could have been a ""by-the-numbers"" shoot-em-up is helped immeasurably by a sub-plot involving the nastiness that goes on in a British public school. The school and robbery subplots converge in a satisfying way, and no one can purr out a terrifying threat better than Sir Michael.",1184198400,11,684,4.436507936507937

8152483,2,B000JMKKIQ,"Review of Shadow Run
Hot Toasty Rag, December 1, 2017

While the man plotline of Shadow Run is Michael Caines assignment from James Fox to steal a security van, the side-plot is much more interesting. Matthew Pochin, a young boy in a Catholic school, comes across a dead body in the beginning of the movie. Michael Caine approaches the boy and tells him to keep his mouth shut, but even though he was wearing a ski mask, theres no mistaking his accent. When Matthew sees him in town later, he recognizes him instantly.

Even though the second lead in the film is a child, this is far from a family-friendly film. Michael Caine is pretty ruthless and the bodies start piling up pretty quickly. This wasn't my favorite of his performances, though, because hes written out as a pretty one-dimensional, cold killer. Theres no underlying emotions that he shows the audience, as he does in Shiner, so if you're looking for a great Michael Caine performance, this isn't the movie to watch. Matthew Pochin is very likable, though, especially because he gets picked on at school so hes all alone except for the audiences support. All in all, its a very tense movie, with the threat of violence as evident as the violence itself. If you like creepy movies, or crime films set in Catholic schools like Absolution or The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, you might like this better than I did.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to  violence, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1512086400,,1505,4.6893939393939394
8152484,1,B000JMKKIQ,"I watch it because Michael Caine is one of my favorite actors, the general plot was interesting, promising of a good movie, however, never, and I mean NEVER, got interesting, boring, badly made, ridiculous side stories that got nowhere....I wasted a good hour and a half watching this BAD movie, if I could have given it ZERO stars that would have been better.",1510272000,,360,4.73015873015873
8152485,3,B000JMKKIQ,"Not as bad as I expected it to be, considering some of the reviews. Caine is always good, and some other actors in the film (James Fox, for example) are pretty good, too. The story's fairly basic but decent, the editing and production are fine while not being outstanding. All in all a good way to relax for a couple hours.",1509408000,,323,4.311475409836065
