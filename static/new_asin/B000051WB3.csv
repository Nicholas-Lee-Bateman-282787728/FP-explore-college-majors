1388023,4,B000051WB3,"I've een waiting for this show to become available in the US for a long time (it aired once on BBCAmerica). It's a great show with kind, realistic (i.e., not slapstick) humor about a lower-class family in England. It was very popular in the UK. I was so desperate for it that I even pre-ordered. That's how good the show is.

But I'm sorry to say I was sorely disappointed with the quality of the DVD transfer. First, it's not widescreen (letterbox). This is a recent show, so I'm fairly certain it was shot in the wider aspect ratio that's the UK adopted much earlier than the US. (I could be wrong about this. There's no easy way to tell.)

Second, the quality of the image is surprisingly bad. There's far too much noise to be considered DVD quality. Happily, it isn't compression artifacts, but it still is a very noisy image -- lots of graininess in the darker areas. I shudder to think what this DVD would look like on a hi-def television. On my old-school TV it's noticably bad. The bad image quality brings it down to 4 stars.

Still, this is the only way to legitimately get this series in the US. I was really looking forward to the second and third seasons, but I won't buy them unless the picture quality is better. There's simply no excuse for this poor quality.",1169856000,33,1275,4.417021276595745

1388031,5,B000051WB3,"Sue Johnston, Ricky Tomlinson, Liz Smith, Ralf Little - and the creators Caroline Aherne & Craig Cash (who also star) make up the perfect chemistry for this beautifully written & acted comedy depicting every day life of the not so rick & famous.  I just wish I had an ""Antony"" at home with me to put the kettle on, run to the off license, etc. so I would not have to miss even a second of viewing.  I also have the other seasons completing the series.  Highly, highly recommended.",1371168000,2,480,4.370786516853933

1388034,4,B000051WB3,"I love the series but the quality of the dvds is bad and thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

1388035,1,B000051WB3,"As a fan of good British comedy, I must be truthful here and tell you....this show is not funny!
It's a low class family who sits around in the living room and talks nonsense.  The father is disgusting, picking his nose and other disgusting gestures.  I waited and waited for even a smile..nothing..it is a great disappointment.  I would not recommend this series to anyone!

If you want good British comedy humor try, Dad's Army (the best), Only Fools and Horses, Open All Night, On the Buses just to name a few.",1318723200,2,513,4.543478260869565

1388037,4,B000051WB3,This was a gift from our daughter and is one of our favorite shows.  The series is a little piece of nostalgia of working class family life in Northern England - my beginnings.  I am avidly awaiting the other series in US format but hope that the quality of the DVD is better than this one.  I want to be able to enjoy it fully.  Please don't sell the programme short!!  The star that is missing reflects poor quality DVD.,1300320000,3,422,4.225
1388038,5,B000051WB3,"Whenever a comedy becomes a hit, a big hit, in the UK, there will be Britons who say. ""It'll never work in America.  They just won't 'get it'"".  The Classic example was Monty Python's Flying Circus, which had a devoted following in the UK, but which everyone agreed - especially the Month Python team themselves- could never succeed in the US.  Of course, they were wrong.  With a quirky comedy like that, there will be, on both sides of the Atlantic, people who will find it hilarious, and others who will stare blankly at it and wonder what the fuss is all about.

The Royle Family is like that.  You'll likely either find it hysterically funny - as I did - or you will be entirely bemused.  I suppose it helps if you come from a working class background.

Americans will probably find the accents difficult.  Carolin Aherne is Mancunian and the series is set near Manchester, so Ricky Tomlinson's Liverpudlian accent was a bit of a surprise.  Anyway, you may want the subtitles on.  I assume the occasional rhyming slang (""I'm going for an Eartha Kitt"") will be understood well enough.

The show has a reality feel to it, being filmed in 16mm film using a single camera and mostly normal lighting.  This, together with the fact that there is no laugh track, gives it a wonderful intimacy.  Try it, and see if it's your cuppa tea.

1388039,5,B000051WB3,"If you understand the culture, this is brilliantly observed and written comedy. If you don't, it will fly right over your head. For anyone who grew up in working class northern England, it cuts very close to the bone.",1253836800,,217,4.589743589743589
1388040,5,B000051WB3,"The couch comedy form can probably get no smaller -- or no more perfect -- than ""The Royle Family"". This minimalist, keenly observed comedy is terrific precisely due to the fact that it's ""not for everyone"". The first season is in some ways stronger than the second if only for its unrelenting, single-minded focus on one small space, shot (almost) entirely with available light and written with a complete absence of sitcom clich, dramedy affectation or any inkling of any sort of denouement. It would be hard to find a better written comedy (including even The Gervais/Merchant ""The Office""). The scripts are always working on at least three levels: the humor that the characters share with each other; the humor the characters don't recognize themselves that is delivered solely to the viewer; and the often subtle and wry interplay between the character dialogue and whatever happens to be playing on the ever present television, the television that implicitly controls the sitting room and by extension, large chunks of the characters' lives.

Not to mention the nagging feeling that we might just be watching ourselves watching television.

As casual as the enterprise may seem, the acting is immaculately detailed, especially given the intimate scale of the program. The writers, cast and directors must be given credit for invoking such a genuine sense of place and character. Like the excellent character work in ""Saxondale"" and the even more cramped quarters of the monologue-driven, short-form ""Marion & Geoff"" (thanks in all cases, including TRF, to the talent of Henry Normal), ""The Royle Family"" is more innovative than it first appears, letting you laugh in unexpected ways. Even at the typestyle used for the credits -- it's called ""Windsor"".",1252281600,15,1758,5.1649122807017545
1388041,5,B000051WB3,"A classic BAFTA award winning British comedy that may not be for everyone's taste, especially if toilet humour is not for you, but what makes this satire show so funny is how close it is to the reality of many of the working class of England.

Performances of Craig Cash (Dave Best) & Ricky Tomlinson (Jim Royle) are pure genius.",1206748800,8,329,4.483333333333333
1388042,5,B000051WB3,"This is a great show for anyone who is addicted to BBC.  At first blush, it seems to be nothing more than a crude British family sitting around watching TV - almost like a faux reality show.  And on one level - it is.  It's not much for production values; I think I counted a total of 3 sets for the whole series.  And the action (if you can call it action) takes place in real time.

But after watching the series (which is, sadly, only 6 episodes long), I gained an appreciation for the characters - and the performances - that was totally unexpected.  There is something about the show that really sucks you into their world.  It's not a world I'd care to live in permanently, but when the last episode was over, I definitely felt that I would miss these characters.

Be advised that the accents are as thick as a whale omelet.  But the DVD comes with helpful subtitles.  I plan to use them the next time I watch, to catch the bits I missed.

Apparently there is a 2nd season, which has yet to be released in North American format.  When it comes out, I will be first in line.",1199145600,7,1079,4.209756097560976
7929569,5,B000051WB3,"I can see watching this and thinking what's the point - but that's if you just watch as though this is a regular family sitting in front of the TV having a meaningless conversation.  If you remain aware that these are actors the brilliance of what they are doing by just having this random non-stop
family conversation becomes really impressive .  It's like a magic trick - how do they do it?  How do they keep it going?  It makes it worth watching more than once when, if you just see it as ""real life""  it can appear so mundane you wonder why you're watching at all.  I'd read other more erudite reviews than mine, but I purchased it upon reading those reviews when one of the main actresses passed away last year.",1499212800,,716,4.345864661654136

7929577,5,B000051WB3,"I was born and raised in Manchester, England, where this show is based, and this is as authentic as it gets! Whether you think it's vulgar, in poor taste, rude, or brilliant...this is Manchester! I now live in the U.S. but I've never felt more home sick as I have since watching this show. This could be my family growing up, everyone's broke, down in the dumps a lot of the time, complains a lot, swears a lot, sits in front of the telly for hours on end in a cramped house with their knickers and socks drying on the radiator. It's absolutely brilliantly written and, in true British style, is absolutely hilarious to watch, but without trying to be. The characters are so true to life, with their signature dry British humour...they're so funny without even trying to be. Growing up where this show was filmed, I can really appreciate it for everything that it is, and I hope you can too because if you've ever wondered about what living in England, and especially the North of England, is like, then this show is your answer!
