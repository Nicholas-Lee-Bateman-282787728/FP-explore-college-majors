4399663,5,B004L2FCOW,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was great fun all the way through.  I like the musical numbers interspersed throughout the movie.  It reminded me of Hollywood's Golden Age when most all movies had at least one musical number.  I thought the visual, acting, and sound track were great.

I do think the movie could have been edited down to 2 or 2.5 hours though.  Also, a friend of mine from India didn't like it near as much as I did, he felt the acting was sub-par.  He says I didn't notice it because I had to read sub-titles.  Maybe so, but I liked it.",1326844800,,565,4.214953271028038

4399665,3,B004L2FCOW,"This dvd arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Unfortunately, the subtitles sit outside the screen, so you have to decrease the screen size to be able to read them. And there's a watermark that appears for a few minutes every ten minutes or so throughout the film. I'd definitely buy from this seller again, but would think twice about a dvd from the dvd company.",1307318400,,367,4.661538461538462
4399666,5,B004L2FCOW,"If you want to see the craziest, most insane car chase ever filmed, check this movie out. It makes Bad Boys 2 and Matrix Reloaded look tame by comparison. This movie was a bit long, but over all was excellent. Amazon is combining reviews for this movie, although multiple products are available. I am reviewing the 1 DVD version. This is exactly the same thing as the 2 DVD version, except the 2 DVD version has a second disc that has a dts track. So basically with that more expensive DVD, you are getting 2 of the same thing. Weird. Just go with the cheaper 1 DVD version unless you really really want dts. The picture is very high quality. This is a high bit rate low compression DVD. Excellent picture and sound. And yes, it will play just fine in the USA.",1304121600,11,760,4.321678321678322
4399667,5,B004L2FCOW,"Rajnikanth proves once again why he deserves the ""Superstar"" title!  Amazing performance by the icon, especially as the ""evil"" robot!  And what can you say more about Aishvairya Rai???

The Special Edition version has high quality transfer and comes with English subtitles.

Amazing special effects and storyline.  Kinda like the ""I, Robot"" theme which puts forth a moral question.  How far do we go with computers and robots?",1301097600,6,426,5.1911764705882355
4399668,4,B004L2FCOW,This movie is amazing.  A real treat for the ears and eyes.  This version comes with two discs.  Identical video but DTS on one and Dolby Digital audio on the other.  Discs are DVD-9.  No special features.  Disc 2 has a trailer for another film.  Occasional watermark of Ayngaran DVD on the bottom right of film.

8433750,5,B004L2FCOW,"This is pure Bollywood on steroids. Lots of over the top action, fight scenes, and music. It's suitable for children and adults. Don't expect any scientific accuracy here, it's just a fun fantasy ride.",1455753600,,201,4.9411764705882355
8433751,1,B004L2FCOW,"Movie is great, bu the DVD was likely created in a DVD burner. After a few months, it is not even playing correctly.",1436659200,,116,4.086956521739131

8433753,5,B004L2FCOW,"I am not from India, but this movie is great. It's also 3 hours long! It's also not region locked or copy protected that I can see. The ""Freeway Scene"" of this movie popped up on Youtube some years ago and became notorious among my friends. I stumbled across this after talking to my Indian coworkers. The movie does feature English sub's. Sometimes the spelling of things is really bad, and there are little spots of English in the movie here and there as that's the culture. This is only the second Rajnikanth movie I have ever seen, but personally I like this one the most. Is it the over the top action or slap stick comedy? Maybe the terrible yet completely effective special effects? I dunno. This movie has a personality that's hard not to love. About the only parts we didn't like was the dance sequences in between major parts of the movie. Not because they were bad, in fact they seemed well made, but just not our thing. You can skip them or soak in the choreographed culture! :)

Kido's to Raj, the rest of the actors, dancers, and director for a very entertaining movie.",1400976000,,1083,4.46969696969697
8433754,4,B004L2FCOW,"I love this movie. It's long, but then most Bollywood films are. And the last 15 minutes will put any Hollywood CGI action film to the test.",1388361600,,140,4.222222222222222
8433755,4,B004L2FCOW,"Great movie with a lot of hilarious (intentional or not) parts, along with the plot in general.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh, and also watching movies where outrageous things happen. (kind of like how Chuck Norris never gets hurt in any of his movies... He crashes a plane nose first into the ground and walks out of the wreckage without a scratch.)

I'm a huge fan of foreign movies (non USA/Canada) , especially Asian horrors/action movies.  This was the first Indian movie i have seen, and it looked incredible when i seen a small clip on YouTube.  I also purchased Ra-One with this film.  Endhiran definitely is a must see.

One spoiler.... Theres a lot of Singing and dancing.  But i enjoyed the music because i have a weak spot for songs in the non english/spanish tongue.",1358208000,,809,4.615384615384615
8433756,4,B004L2FCOW,"Reportedly the biggest box-office hit in India's film history, ""Endhiran"" (meaning ""robot"" in Tamil) is exactly what entertainment should be. It has romance, great music and lots of action. The film is flawed, but is never boring, and that is the most important thing in this Kollywood blockbuster.

The Tamil superstar Rajinikanth plays a genius scientist Dr. Vaseekaran, who has created a super-powered, hyper-intelligent robot ""Chitti"" in his own image (played by Rajinikanth). This should be a breakthrough for the world of robotics, but things go wrong when Chitti is made to have its own emotions. In short, Chitti falls in love with the doctor's girlfriend Sana (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan).

Some film fans may remember Aishwarya Rai Bachchan as the heroine of ""Bride & Prejudice,"" a modern-day, cross-cultural version of Jane Austen's classic novel. It has been more than ten years since I first saw her in a Hindi film ""Straight from the Heart,"" and she was very impressive then. In ""Endhiran"" she plays Sana, the doctor's neglected sweetheart, and lets her comedic side shine with her charming interaction with Rajinikanth.

The story of ""Endhiran"" is uneven and it takes itself too seriously at some points. The special effects also vary in quality; some are nice, some not so. But when action kicks in, the film delivers. Director Shankar employs an ""anything goes"" style in action, and it works: kung-fu fighting in a train (choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping); ""Matrix Reloaded""-style car action on the highway; and non-stop combat sequence involving an army of robots (imagine lots of Schwarzenegger's Terminator) attacking like Decepticons of ""Transformers.""

The soundtrack is composed by Oscar-winning musician A.R. Rahman (""Slumdog Millionaire"" and many others). The film also has impressive musical scenes, some of which are shot in Lenis Maranhenses National Park, Brazil and Machu Picchu, Peru. Also, there is one musical segment (set inside Chitti's head!), in which the stars are seen dancing to a catchy techno-pop number with metallic robot dancers.

In short ""Endhiran"" is fun with lots of great visual ideas. Trivia: Rajinikanth returns as ""Chitti"" in a cameo in ""Ra. One"" starring Shah Rukh Khan, who was originally cast as Dr. Vaseekaran / Chitti, but left the project.",1351382400,3,2292,5.2684931506849315
8433757,5,B004L2FCOW,I thought I was getting an absurdly awesome killer robot film but what I got instead was an absurdly awesome killer robot film with a really fantastic plot along with it. Worth every penny.,1349395200,,189,4.588235294117647
8433758,3,B004L2FCOW,"Since Amazon unfortunately lumps all reviews of a given work together regardless of medium or edition, I'm writing this to say that my copy of the ""Endhiran 2 DVD Special Edition"" version is just fine. Good quality, good subtitles, good packaging. Appears genuine and not pirated. The film is not a masterpiece, but it's great eye candy, the story is not overly stupid (albeit predictable), and the acting is fine.",1336608000,2,414,4.928571428571429
8433759,3,B004L2FCOW,"seriously, sound on the title screen hit play and nothing, thank god for subtitles, but I am really let down by the manufacturer, such a epic movie and 3 hours with musical numbers and no sound.",1327363200,,194,4.416666666666667
