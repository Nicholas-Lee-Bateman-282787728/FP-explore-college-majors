4955670,5,B006517WZE,"What a rare film this is: wonderfully entertaining yet substantive and intellectually challenging.  Visually the film proceeds with cinematographic splendor, much of it shot on location where Mahler composed--Alpine lakes, mountains and meadows--yet other scenes are more contemporary, as if to untether the meaning of the symphony from any one specific historical period.  In terms of the flow of ideas, this is a deeply engaging and satisfying film.  Martha Nussbaum, among the most famous of living philosophers, shares her thoughts on the ethical and evolutionary nature of Mahler's Second Symphony.  She is joined by preeminent Mahler experts and music historians such as Henry-Louis de La Grange, Donald Mitchell, Constantin Floros and Stephen Hefling, whose books form the foundation of modern Mahler scholarship.  A more authoritative and enthusiastic bunch I could not imagine.  Opera star and Mahler scholar in his own right, Thomas Hampson, sings and narrates.  One can tell that everything about this film is well thought out and thoroughly researched.  One also feels that this documentary is lovingly made with a passion to share what is rare in symphonic music: deep extra-musical meaning.  This has been the subject of books and essays but in film form all the dramatic elements come together--visual, theatrical, and of course the power of the music itself.  This is an inspiring and generous film that explores the redeeming nature of love (so primal in Mahler's music in general but specifically important to his Second Symphony) through biographical, cultural, philosophical and musical perspectives.  With few exceptions, I would think any lover of classical music or anyone thrilled by the world of ideas would greatly enjoy, even cherish, this film.",1350950400,4,1772,5.430656934306569
4955671,1,B006517WZE,"People today often become captivated by visual images of all kinds, including visual images connected to music in some way.  This idea of visual music escalated with the marketing of pop music videos in the 1980s and has spread into the area of classical music as well.  In a broad sense, one wonders why a listener would want a filmmaker interpreting the music for him, especially when the person can simply listen to the music alone to gain insights.  Maybe what one's own mind comes up with in a listening experience means more than watching assorted interviews of musical experts, or visual effects created by producers or video technicians.  You don't necessarily have to ""see"" music: if a listener wants more information about a work, the person can consult countless articles and books, reading as much as one wishes in researching answers to his/her questions.

I have met filmmaker Jason Starr and attended showings of two of his videos on Mahler:  ""Of Love, Death, and Beyond, Exploring Mahler's Resurrection Symphony"" and ""What the Universe Tells Me--Unraveling the Mysteries of Mahler's Third Symphony.""

I rated these programs at the lowest level because their thin content doesn't offer much of significance, plus they introduce misleading material.  For instance, in the program on the Resurrection symphony, when discussing Mahler's youth in Bohemia as a Jew, Starr presents a recreated Austrian Roman Catholic funeral procession, creating a context problem.  And when discussing the Klopstock Ode of the last movement, Starr shows a choir singing at that point, implying they sing the music of the Ode as once heard by Mahler.  But we can't confirm exactly what music Mahler heard on that occasion, or to what extent he incorporated into the movement.  We also see images presumably depicting what departed people see after death--based on Starr's ideas I guess.

The program on the Third symphony contains many similar fanciful visual effects, such as his depiction of God, or love or the Universe, in the last movement.  The program's title suggests how much Starr overreaches: most of Mahler's movement descriptions concern the Earth--mountains, flowers, lower animals, man--not the entire starry Universe as the filmmaker suggests.  In fact, what big ""mysteries"" referred to in the title actually exist in regard to the Third symphony?  Mahler pretty clearly documented in print what the symphony deals with, and of course one can hear his magical visions of nature in the music itself, without the aid of a video production. So what do we need to ""unravel?"" (I do really like the complete performance of the Third that Starr excerpted for the video--the young musicians of the Manhattan School of Music conducted by Glen Cortese, available on 2 CDs, without the Starr film.)

If you want thought-provoking video material about Mahler, investigate Leonard Bernstein's ""Little Drummer Boy"" and ""Four Ways to Say Farewell,"" or even Christoph von Eschenbach's intriguing ""A Wayfarer's Journey,"" to name a few.  But no film productions about Mahler surpass the enjoyment of you listening to the music yourself, and letting it engage your mind.  Mahler's music, after all, ignites intense, deeply personal feelings and impressions--your own of course, those that matter the most.",1343433600,11,3295,5.2201138519924095
4955672,5,B006517WZE,"I am adding to this original review to take issue with the person who descries the modern need for images, as if we can only enjoy and understand through images now and that a DVD like this panders to that need. Wrong! Also, that reviewer laments the fixing of the musics multivalent sense in a concrete visual image. All music is interpretation, but also all images presented are rpesetned as interpretations,not as the fixed solution. Starr's wonderful images help us enter the music , but do not hold us to a fixed point. They are the starting point for a journey of feeling, understanding and wandering within the wonder of the music.

By the layperson, I mean that although I love classical music, I am not someone who knows music theory or the fine details of orchestration, etc. I found this 2 disc set fabulous! First of all, I loved not only hearing this magnificent symphony, but seeing all the performers playing at close-up range--seeing their technique and passion for the music. The performance is sumptuous. The disc that explores the possible meaning of what Mahler was trying to express through the symphony is fascinating and lively--with a variety of musicologists, performers, philosophers, theologians and others discussing its meaning and how it is conveyed through each aspect of the music. The interpretation shaped by Jason Starr is quite unique, I believe, and quite fascinating. He gets us to think of possibilities about death and its meaning, and the meaning of resurrection, that are quite varied and suggestive. The shots of the re-enacted life of Mahler and the scenes of life in the areas in which he wrote, and those shots that somehow symbolize the ineffable are all well-done--creative and stimulating. Don't miss this disc and invite some friends over to watch it with you and discuss its ramifications. You'll have a lot of fun!",1339027200,4,1866,4.942675159235669

4955674,5,B006517WZE,"Following up the success of his brilliant film about Mahler's Third Symphony, What The Universe Tells Me, Jason Starr has produced and directed an insightful and inspiring motion picture, entitled Of Love, Death and Beyond , in which he explores the depths and heights of Mahler's Second Symphony. Narrated by possibly the finest Mahler singer of our time, Thomas Hampson, the film presents a virtual cavalcade of celebrated Mahler scholars and performers who enlighten us with their in-depth comments about this towering masterpiece, performed here by members of several major orchestras under the direction of Maestro Neeme Jrvi. Ingeniously conceived visual effects reinforce the deep emotions stirred by the music and provide extraordinarily evocative imagery that enhances the compelling commentary. I recommend it for all lovers of Mahler's music, whether they have vast experience in listen to it or have never heard a note of it. We look forward with anxious anticipation to Starr's next film project on Mahler and his music.

4955675,5,B006517WZE,"I enthusiasticaly agree with the other reviewers in giving this 2-DVD set five stars plus! Disc one contains an insightful, penetrating, and detailed musical/philosophical/psychological analysis that is deftly and seamlessly illustrated with both musical selections from the symphony and great visual art among other images. Among those speaking are Mahler scholars Henry-Louis de la Grange, Donald Mitchell, and Stephen Hefling and others; theologians; and the noted philosopher Martha Nussbaum from the University of Chicago. Baritone Thomas Hampson, one of the foremost interpreters of Mahler's songs, provides narration. A second DVD contains the entire symphony performed at Riverside Church in New York City with thoughtful direction and sharply defined editing; a bargain for the additional $10 over the single disc product of just disc 1&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Of-Love-Death-and-Beyond-Exploring-Mahler-s-Resurrection-Symphony/dp/B006517WZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Of Love Death, and Beyond, Exploring Mahler's Resurrection Symphony</a>.

4955676,5,B006517WZE,"This beautiful film engages our mind, heart and above all, our sense of mystery.  What is the extra-musical meaning of this symphony?  Is it even important?  Mahler was a poet and thinker in addition to being a composer.  It is up to each listener to decide how deeply they will enter the gesamtkunstwerk that is a Mahler symphony.  ""Of Love, Death and Beyond"" offers a gripping way in.  World-renowned Mahler experts and philosophers (including Martha Nussbaum), together with historical reenactments, an evocative palette of images, and Mahler's own narration open up the luminous possibilities suggested by the music.  The journey is tied together with a masterful performance by members of the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra and others conducted by two-time winner of the Toblach Mahler Prize, Neeme Jrvi.  As in his earlier documentary about Mahler's Third Symphony, ""What the Universe Tells Me"", filmmaker Jason Starr has created an experience so artistic and rich with images and ideas that you will want to see it again and again.  Thomas Hampson performs and narrates.  The DVD offers spectacular 5.1 surround sound.",1329264000,3,1140,5.283333333333333
4955677,5,B006517WZE,"RENS' review of this exploration of Mahler's Second Symphony is right on the money.

The film is everything I had hoped for ... the nearly hour and a half flew right by, leaving me with new insights regarding this wonderful piece of music, as well as forever grateful for the experience of enjoying an art form such as this in its' ultimate expression.

It is a reminder to us of (1) how magnificent divinely inspired human creativity can be, and (2) how fortunate we are in this day and age to have such access to great classical music and opera.",1328659200,9,547,4.46
4955678,5,B006517WZE,"This superb film offers an in depth study of Mahler's 2nd Symphony from its conception to its completion. The involvement of a generous number of outstanding musicians and scholars (musicologists, philosophers, theologians) and the narration by Thomas Hampson beyond doubt recommend this DVD. The re-enactments of incidents in Mahler's life are carefully done, and the cinematography is stunningly beautiful. As a fan and student of the works of Mahler for over fifty years, I recommend this film and the performance video with great enthusiasm and without reservation. The High Definition quality of the film could not be bettered and the recorded sound is beyond reproach.

This 2 DVD set includes the complete performance of the symphony in New York City's Riverside Church by an orchestra of musicians especially brought together from the New York Philharmonic, the Detroit Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and assembled chorus from the NYC area.

8493046,5,B006517WZE,"For most of my life, Mahler's music has been an extremely important part of it. His second symphony, ""Resurrection,"" is almost a statement of religious belief: ""I am from God and will return to God.""

Really, just as the title states, the ""Resurrection"" symphony deals with the most important thoughts about life: love, death, and beyond.
For those of us who hold Mahler's music so dear and different, it transcends all other music. Perhaps it could be said that it's a vehicle to express human emotion and our struggle to understand life, death, and our place in the cosmos.

For years, I've struggled, usually unsuccessfully, attempting to tell others why Mahler's second symphony is so different from all music that came before; why it means so much to many of us.

This DVD does it far better than I've ever been able to do, taking the symphony, movement by movement, and relating it to our ""biggest"" questions about life--again ""love, death and beyond.""

Each section of the symphony is discussed by biographers, music historians, theologians, and philosophers, as they relate this exceptional musical work to the human condition. (Just to mention a few: Henry-Louis de la Grange, Peter Franklin, Donald Mitchell, Thomas Hampson, Catherine Keller, Constantin Floros and Martha Nussbaum. Their comments helped me better assimilate what I thought I had already understood.)

By the way, this commentary is in no way too technical or ""professorial."" It's like having a small group of friends around you to discuss something we all care about. This group of ""musical friends"" relate how ear, mind and heart help us understand life, love and death.

Jason Starr's juxtaposition of the fish in ""Antony of Padua's Sermon to the Fish"" with street scenes of busy people ""swimming"" across a busy intersection is brilliantly done. It gives clearer meaning to Antony's sermon to the fish, and why Mahler included it in the symphony.

Whether you're a longtime Mahler fan, or just someone curious about ""the meaning of life,"" this film could be just the thing for increasing your understanding and appreciation of music and life.",1426636800,4,2121,5.060171919770774
