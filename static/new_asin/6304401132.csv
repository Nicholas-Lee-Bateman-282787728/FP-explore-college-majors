866829,3,6304401132,"In this 1959 movie Disney's animation regressed to flat, 2-dimensional characters.  The movie is only 1 hour 15 minutes, but it becomes boring and seems too long.  The only outstanding aspect of this movie is its theme song's melody, composed by Tchaikovsky.  There is a major contradiction: at the beginning the 3 fairies say their magic cannot overcome Maleficent, but near the end their magic triumphs over Maleficent.",1509580800,,421,5.161764705882353

I have never had this issue with a blue ray purchased. Why didn't I check the product features and description you ask? Because it's a blue ray disk of a movie I've seen since childhood. I never would have thought to check the description when all pertinent information was on the title, or so I thought.

867578,3,6304401132,"I received this today. I was nervous to buy this fearing it would be in Korean or not play on US equipment. The package I received looks just like the photo, though the top of the package is edited out in the product package image displayed on Amazon.  The banner on the top ( omitted in the photo) says Blueray + HD-DVD.  For those that do not remember, HD-DVD was the high definition video format that competed with Blu-ray, and became obsolete a number of years ago.  An HD-DVD cannot be played on a standard DVD player.  The photo says Disney Blu-ray & DVD Double Edition.  This is not exactly true. There are two disks, but one is Blu-ray and one is HD-DVD.  The DVD logo is printed on the Blu-ray Disc, which might mean it is dual encoded with both a Blu-ray and a standard DVD version on one disc.  I was able to verify that the Blu-ray version played on a Blu-ray player, and the HD-DVD disc played one an HD-DVD player ( I actually have one), but I could not determine if a standard DVD player can read either disk.  You can select English audio on both versions, though it appears that these packages were intended for the Asian market.  I cannot tell if it is bootlegged or a legitimate copy.  There is no Walt Disney logo on the package or the the disks, which strikes me as odd.  I have not watched it yet. I just ran the test to see if it could get it to play and use English audio, which it does.  Three stars because although it plays in English on US Blu-ray players it is not accurately presented as containing an obsolete HD-DVD format disk and because it is devoid of Walt Disney Company logos and copyright labels.",1485993600,7,1635,4.30718954248366

867806,4,6304401132,"The animation for this movie is gorgeous. I love the smoothness, the angular lines, Aurora's character design and the way the forest is drawn, the love, care and effort that was obviously put into it. It's really surprising to me just how beautiful this animation is.
As for the story itself, it's nothing wildly exciting. It is a fairy tale and is pretty by-the-book. I do love fairy tales, though, despite their simplicity, so the movie is entertaining. The quarreling kings are funny, the fairies are lovely and charming, Maleficent is elegantly evil. The movie doesn't waste alot of time boring you with mouse shenanigans like in Cinderella or dwarf ones in Snow White, which makes it easy and pleasant to watch. It has fewer actual songs than the other two movies have, but the poetry the characters recite is great. I Wonder and Once Upon a Dream are beautiful and catchy.
I admit Aurora isn't brimming with personality. Unlike the previous princesses, who were kind, helpful and optimistic, if one dimensional, she comes off as kind of a nice girl, but mostly not much more than a daydreamy teenager, who falls into a deathlike sleep not long after she's introduced. Still, that's sort of to be expected.",1481760000,,1211,4.826923076923077

I tried converting them to DVD or digital media, but no go--I finally just gave them away and am in the process of rebuilding my collection. For any body who hasn't seen Sleeping Beauty (is there really anybody out there who hasn't?) this is a classic Disney movie with quotable lines that you will remember (and use!) years down the road. But underneath the hilarity and memorability, there is an endearing story that has earned this movie its' place in the ""Classic"" hall of fame.

It all has to do with the commentary track. Leonard Maltin is often the commentary on the more classic Disney films, but often he is the host to assembled commentary. Commentary assembled from the animators, artists, and Walt himself from previous interviews while they were still alive that not only gave fascinating insight into all the normal sweet stuff and how they made it, but this juicy little argument between the new painter they brought in on the film and the toes of the older animators he stepped on.
 OOOH, when I heard that commentary for the DvD I rented I fell in love with it. But when I tried buy it I got a copy with the Lasseter/Deja commentary. I tried again to find the exact edition of the DvD and even went to the library and photographed the box cover for it, bought another one based on that cover........and it was Lasseter and Deja again.
No offense to either of them. We oh them a ton for the movies they made and they are great people.........but as commenters on this film they amount to fanboys.
Until I find that exact edition, I will throw every ounce of dirt I can at Disney for not making the one WITH THE 9 OLD MEN TALKING ON IT the DEFAULT special feature! This diamond edition is made of glass.",1464739200,4,1370,4.326848249027237

870147,5,6304401132,"Most of the credit for this film goes to Eyvind Earle who is responsible for the incredible, highly sophisticated, backgrounds that supervising director Clyde Geronimi tried to dilute as much as possible.  All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that.  Thats all well and good, but who the hells going to look at that!?  Earle left Disney Studio in March 1958, before Sleeping Beauty was completed.  And Geronimi set about doing a hatchet job on the only beautiful thing in Sleeping Beauty.  That any of Earles artwork survived Geronimis hissy-fit is a miracle owed to Disney, who liked what Earle had created.  Sadly, Sleeping Beauty was not a big hit upon its initial release.  Despite that, it has become an enduring classic with one of the best villains every committed to film (real or animated).  Pity Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) didn't get more screen time.  Poor woman, saddled with severely incompetent lackeys who wasted sixteen years scouring the countryside looking for a baby.  Meanwhile, said baby is being raised by three incredibly incompetent fairies who cant cook, cant sew, and cant clean without the aid of their wands..........however did they manage to raise a baby!!!",1453420800,,1208,5.055555555555555

870506,4,6304401132,"Disney has had the most impressive catalog of animated movies in the world, but when they got around to doing Sleeping Beauty, they really pulled out all the stops in this pure feast for the eyes. As their 16th full-length animated feature(which includes anthology movies like Melody Time), this was also the last one they did based on a fairy tale for at least 30 years until The Little Mermaid came out, mostly because the movie surprisingly didn't initially do to well at the box office, despite how much work was put into.

 Based on the Grimm Fairy Tale, a princess named Aurora is born in a faraway kingdom, and her coronation is blessed by three fairies: Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Flora and Fauna bless her with magically endowed beauty and singing talent, but are interrupted by the wicked fairy(even though she's more like somekind of she-demon)Maleficent who was seriously ticked for not being invited to the royal shindig, so she curses Aurora with being killed getting pricked by a spinning wheel when she turns 16. Merryweather counters this by having the spell broken not with the princess' death but by sleep awoken only by love's first kiss. The good fairies convince the king to let them take the princess into hiding in a cottage in the woods for the next 16 years, where Aurora is called Briar Rose, and totally unaware of her royal heritage. Cut a decade and a half, Aurora grows up to be quite the looker(although being magically endowed didn't hurt), and an excursion into the woods has the now teenage ""Brair Rose"" encounters the wandering Prince Phillip, her unknown soon to be husband. The two fall stereotypically for each other, and Brair Rose heads back to tell her caretakers the good news, however the shock of learning that she's really a princess betrothed to someone else puts a serious damper on her birthday. After becoming far too impatient with her bungling underlings, Maleficent sends familiar out to find Aurora, and he hears the whole scoop from spying on the fairies. Maleficent sets an ambush for Aurora(instead of the old ""poisoned apple"" gag)at her cottage, but ends up capturing Phillip instead. Aurora and the fairies had instead left earlier and headed to the castle, where Maleficent hypnotizes her into touching a conjured up spinning wheel, and sending her into her a magical coma. The fairies put the whole kingdom to sleep in order to shorten the damage, and free Phillip. He makes a dashing escape thanks to a some suped-up weapons they pulled out of hammerspace. Maleficent furiously turns into a nightmarish dragon, but gets impaled by Phillips ""magic sword"". The Prince then kisses Aurora and everyone else wakes up and live all happily ever after.

Sleeping Beauty is a fantastic visual marvel as it was one of the first animated movies done in widescreen, plus one of the few movies done in Technirama. There is some roto-scoping involved, but this more helps the movie than hinders it. The only downside is there isn't much actual development with the title character as its mostly centered on the good and evil fairies, but as usual the Disney Princess gets all the hype. This is partially why exchanges like the kings arguing over where their children will live or the fairies bickering over dress colors take up a good portion of the movie's run time. The animated movie is more of a necessity to see than the live-action Maleficent reboot, but also for being a major chapter in cinematic animation.",1447113600,,3468,4.85472972972973

871173,5,6304401132,"When Disney produced this fairy tale based on The Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault and Little Briar Rose by The Brothers Grimm,it spent $6 million which made it the most expensive animated movie during its time of release during the postwar in 1959. It contains amazing musical scores and songs that were adapted from the Sleeping Beauty ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and memorable iconic characters such as Princess Aurora,Maleficent and Prince Philip.

The story revolves around a young princess who was cursed a birth by an evil fairy,the baby was taken into custody by the three good fairies who took care of the her. Nevertheless,the baby still fell asleep at 16 and the evil fairy takes her into a prisoner. She could only be awakened by a kiss of a handsome prince. When the prince decides to rescue her,the evil fairy became a breathing dragon forcing a clash with the prince.

This is definitely a postwar Disney classic that remains a masterpiece since it was first released more than fifty years ago. The songs,the sound and the grandeur remains magnificent despite using dated technology back then. Also,the actors/actresses who provided their voices that made many characters iconic for many years to come.",1438473600,,1227,5.039408866995074

I was so captivated by the experience a year or two afterward - obviously after I'd learned to read - I noticed the local drive-in was showing - Sleeping Beauty.  My family had not planned on seeing it this time but thru constant whining and outright crying (I'm ashamed to admit) I managed to persuade them my life depended upon it.  While I was predictably enthralled by just about everything Disney ever put out - Snow White, Bambi, Dumbo, Cinderella - still there has ALWAYS been this feeling, this sensation that Sleeping Beauty was unique.  The artistry, the animation, the colors and especially the music itself captured me in a way no other movie has done.  I'm still awe-struck when I watch it and I wonder if there were different artists at work on this one or exactly WHY is Sleeping Beauty so much more beautiful than the others?  I hope to find out something in the special features, but I'm certain there is something unique about it.  The music alone is reason enough to purchase but the artwork and the magnificent performance of Maleficent with that exquisite voice - I believe most people enjoy this movie the same way I did.

872026,4,6304401132,"One of my favorite Disney films, because there is an innocence about this film, and it also features so many of my favorites:  my favorite Disney song - ""Once Upon a Dream""; my favorite Disney princess - I thought Aurora exceptionally beautiful as Briar Rose in her peasant costume (more so than in her pink gown), and Prince Philip - yeah, he's cocky but brave - is the handsomest Disney prince.

This story is quite simple.  The gorgeous, and powerful, and vindictive Maleficent is furious for not being invited to celebrate the princess's birth, and she curses King Stephen's daughter.  Three good bumbling fairies attempt to assuage the potency of the curse.  But it is all for naught because Aurora falls regardless.

Maleficent is amazing.  So wildly bewitching.  She is one of the most frightening figures in Disney's creation.  But I love her regardless.

The animation is lovely, though nowhere as complex as current day.  But it's beauty surpasses some modern films and fairy tales.  I love this film, and I believed in its tale of love, its triumph over evil, and I want Aurora to succeed because she and Philip are good.

Kind of wonderful - but you had to believe.",1429142400,,1177,4.767326732673268

The picture and sound quality is excellent (there were some minor fuzzy spots, however). The digital copy is also a great bonus, especially if you like to watch movies wherever you go.

My biggest disappointment was that this item came without the slipcover. I collect Disney movies, and having the slipcovers is something I like. I wish it was explicitly stated whether or not the slipcover is included in the item description. I would have bought this from somewhere else (or another Amazon seller) if I'd have known this before ordering.",1426636800,,659,4.584745762711864

And, hearing  Tchaikovsky's delightful ballet score running throughout the film is a big plus.  Of all the characters, the three good fairies are the most well-realized and depicted.  And of course, Maleficent, the wicked witch, steals every scene she's in.  The other characters are beautifully drawn, but remain a bit flat in terms of personality development.  Overall, this was a much better film than I expected and recommend it highly.",1426636800,,570,5.337078651685394

874167,5,6304401132,This was always one of my favorite Disney movies growing up.  I waited forever for it to be released in this combo pack.  It was previously released in a blu-ray/dvd combo pack but no digital copy was included with it.  The movies has been beautifully restored and all of the gorgeous imagery in it looks better than ever.  I was so happy to be able to watch this childhood favorite again in high definition.  Compared to it's previous blu-ray release the features are the same.  The main difference is the cover art (I actually prefered the previous releases cover art) which I think played up the Maleficent angle in order to tie in with the release of their newer live-action film Maleficent and the fact that it includes the digital copy of the film.,1420243200,3,754,4.58955223880597

FILM FACT: SLEEPING BEAUTY marked the first animated feature to be shot in Super Technirama 70mm, a technique that exposes images onto double 35mm frames, which are then processed on a 70mm print. The film was printed on special printer lenses developed for Disney by Panavision. The format, which allows the film to move horizontally through the camera instead of vertically and provides a greater range of vision, required the artists to move the characters through a large field of action via intricate mathematical calculations, and to create new colour schemes.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: SLEEPING BEAUTY was originally made available in 2008 by way of the 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition Blu-ray release, which was such grand treatment on Blu-ray is only befitting of the labour of love that SLEEPING BEAUTY became from the Walt Disney Studio in the 1950s. The film's production spanned  almost the entire decade, beginning with story concept work in 1951 and ending in 1959 with the film's theatrical release. Sleeping Beauty was a great strain on the studio's finances, especially from its concept and of course its manpower. It cost so much, in fact over $6 million, that even though it was a box office success upon its release, the animation film still did not recoup its production costs on its initial run. Since then, however, SLEEPING BEAUTY, has become a most profitable property for the Walt Disney Company, as its nearly 50-year legacy has touched generations of filmgoers...

I'm sure I'm not the first to make the observation that the villains of Disney's animated features are often more interesting than their heroes and heroines. Think of Cruella de Vil in '101 DALMATIONS,' the Wicked Witch of 'SNO WHITE,' or the Beast of 'Beauty and the Beast,' and it's easy to savour all of the cruel wickedness far more than the blandly-vanilla sweetness. Nowhere may this be more true than with SLEEPING BEAUTY, a perfectly fine fable in the Disney canon, but one where its titular Princess Aurora and her romantic melodrama are overshadowed by the vividly drawn supporting characters, and particularly the delightfully-demonic Maleficent. SLEEPING BEAUTY is one where all of the story and character elements all come together in letting us see how the Disney's technical artistry create something truly special.

By now the story of SLEEPING BEAUTY is known by just about anyone who ever had a fairy tale read to them as a child. Based on the first section of Charles Perrault's short story ""La Belle au Bois Dormant"" and published as part of Perrault's 1697 book ""The Tales of My Mother Goose."" It's only fair to Disney to say the source material is slim at best. Culled from a mere four paragraphs from Perrault, the tale is quite straightforward and simplistic. Running a brilliant 75 minutes, and the film shows all aspects of its main human characters, which are generic at best. The villain, Maleficent, energises the film, and even the animal characters seem more, well, animated. The real beauty of SLEEPING BEAUTY, is in the stunning details, its supporting characters, its wondrous visual acumen, its memorable songs and its beautifully-rendered animation.

SLEEPING BEAUTY is remembered as much, if not more, for its sights and sounds. 'Sleeping Beauty' was produced at a crucial period in American cinema, as television was sweeping the nation and moviegoers were rapidly abandoning the theatre seats for the comfort of their couches. Like all of the major studios at the time, Walt Disney was looking for something new to attract its dwindling audiences. SLEEPING BEAUTY was the first Disney feature to adopt many technological advances of the time, including 70mm (Super Technirama 70) and six-track audio. The film is also a widescreen beauty, composed in 2.55:1, and produced in three-strip Technicolor. It is also the last hand-drawn Disney feature to be inked entirely by human hands.

The result is that there is much to savour and admire in SLEEPING BEAUTY. The film is absolutely and undeniably beautiful and its animation is as splendid as any of the unquestionable classics in the Disney pantheon, including 'SNOW WHITE,' 'CINDERELLA' and 'BAMBI.' Marking a further creative departure from past Disney features; SLEEPING BEAUTY has a more arch and defined visual style. Next to the Barbie-like Aurora and angular evil of Maleficent, the plump Snow White seems positively cherubic by comparison. The colour palette, too, is darker and more foreboding. The forest is teeming with menace, thanks to the use of rich, deep purples, green, and reds that are gorgeously realised. The contrast with the far more cheery world of Aurora is also thematically ripe, adding a suggestion of complexity to a story that is greatly in need of depth.

With its action and intensity, SLEEPING BEAUTY is also more aggressive than some previous Disney features. The climactic battle to lift the curse that imprisons the slumbering Aurora, between Prince Philip and an awesome dragon Maleficent, is quite suspenseful and visceral, enough that I'm sure it has scared the out of many small children over the years. The reign of misery that Maleficent and her shadow self/raven Diablo cast upon the kingdom is also no child's play. There is a heft to the darkness in 'Sleeping Beauty' that further helps to off-set the clich&eacute;d and conventional aspects of its romantic confections.

SLEEPING BEAUTY may have a plain story, but its strengths are in its spectacle and its select memorable moments and characters. Maleficent is superbly designed, and brought to smooth, scheming life by the excellent voice work of Eleanor Audley. Even her raven sidekick has a pronounced personality, becoming a creature the viewer just loves to hate. Aurora and Phillip's initial meeting and courtship in a highly stylized forest setting is probably the film's most memorable sequence. If not that, then certainly the thrilling climactic battle between Phillip and Maleficent, transformed into an awesome and gorgeously evil dragon. Every turn of a head is carefully drawn and choreographed, and every corner of the screen is filled with luxuriant detail. All of it, down to the last leaf, tapestry, or rocky crag, shines through in this totally beautiful stunning in this high definition Blu-ray release. It is truly a sight to behold.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  SLEEPING BEAUTY has received a wonderful and stunning 1080p encoded offering of a beautiful transfer restoration, with at last framed at 2.55:1, showing more area at the top/bottom and sides of the picture than ever seen before). According to a provided Disney's press materials, 'Sleeping Beauty' has undergone a meticulous frame-by-frame clean-up, culled from the original nitrate negative and requiring years to complete. The result is clearly superior to any video or theatrical, for that matter, presentation seen before. If this is indicative of Disney's future Platinum Series presentations, fans are in for a treat. The source is just about impeccable, with no traces of dirt or blemishes. Blacks are pure, with little of the print fluctuations that usually plague material of this vintage. Contrast is vibrant but retains a film-like look, and there is no faux-digitisation of the image. The originally, already-brilliant Technicolor palette is superior and, in some cases, greatly improved over the previous DVD version. Darker scenes, such as night-time forest scenes and those with Maleficent boast much cleaner and deeper purples, reds and blues. And thanks to the wonders of digital technology, the often disastrous misalignment of three-plate Technicolor is absent here, so the image is always uniform. Detail and sharpness also receive a noticeable boost. The image is three-dimensional, with appreciable depth and excellent clarity even in the most detailed shots. Shadow delineation sees a jump over the inferior DVD release, such as fine textures of Aurora's clothing or minor details in background plates which are now clearly visible rather than vague mush. It's also no surprise that this is a rock-solid encode, with no apparent edge enhancement or motion artefacts.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Going above and beyond the audio usually offered on re-masters of classic titles, Disney offers a stunning awesome 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track for 'Sleeping Beauty.' It's an excellent beautiful remix, with the studio utilizing newly-discovered 35mm 3-track recordings. Certainly, SLEEPING BEAUTY has never sounded better. It also offers the Original Stereo Theatrical Mix. SLEEPING BEAUTY has been expanded nicely to 7.1. The rear soundstage is nice and full, with the original sound stems utilized to create truly discrete effects that pan smoothly between channels. I did not notice any great exploitation of the two extra surround channels, but certainly the surrounds are full and alive with sound. Minor ambiance is also nicely sustained, particularly during the outdoor and action-y moments. Clarity and depth to dynamic range is full-bodied, with the elements betraying their nearly 50-year age. Low bass is also deep and tight, but not overpowering. The score is also technically impeccable, with a richness I wasn't expecting from the original older title release. All spoken words are very clean and very nicely pronounced. As with this Blu-ray release, Disney has more than earned the Platinum designation with this 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio upgrade.

Convinced that King Stefans order to burn all the spinning wheels in the kingdom will not prevent Maleficents curse, the good fairies put a magic circle around the castle and cast a spell: No evil thing that walks or flies or creeps or crawls can ever pass these castle walls.

The Curse is Fulfilled The three good fairies have just returned Aurora to the castle and give her a crown. They leave the room to give Aurora some time alonebut Maleficent pays her a visit.

Arrival of Maleficent (Alternate Scene) Maleficent arrives uninvited to the christening of the Princess Aurora.

All three items are presented by way of original storyboards, narration and newly recorded voice work.

Special Feature: Once Upon a Parade [2014] [1080p] [9:00] Modern Family's Sarah Hyland shares the fairy tale ""history"" of Walt Disney World's new Festival of Fantasy Parade with a small group of young Disney tourists and how the Festival of Fantasy Parade was saved by a quick-thinking peasant girl, whom she plays in the story. Once Upon a Parade stars the amazing Sarah Hyland from ABCs Modern Family, and we had a fantastic time working on the project. Im not certain I know a bigger fan of the Disney Parks than Sarah? Check out this video, where Sarah talks about the project, her passion for all things Disney!

Special Feature: The Art of Evil: Generations of Disney Villains [1080p] [10:00] Animators Lino DiSalvo [FROZEN] and Andreas Deja [ALADDIN and The Lion King] share memories of their favourite Disney villains and discuss the keys to creating memorable antagonists, all while looking back at the career, contributions and iconic characters of classic Disney animator, Marc Davis [SLEEPING BEAUTY], among many others, who appears via vintage interview snippets.

Special Feature: @DisneyAnimation: Artists in Motion (Extended Edition) [1080p] [4:00] Join Walt Disney Animation Visual Development artist Brittney Lee as she goes through the process of creating a three dimensional sculpture of Maleficent, completely out of paper. In this extended edition, we go deeper into Britney Lees process. I thought this particular item was a complete load of old rubbish and a total waste of time!

Special Feature: Beauty-Oke: Once Upon a Dream [1080p] [3:00] A dynamic sing-along for ""Once Upon a Dream.""

Classic Bonus Features:

Special Feature: The Sound Of Beauty: Restoring A Classic [1080p] [11:00] Presented in 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, this stunning feature, where we sit down with Randy Thornton and Terry Porter, the sound restoration technicians that worked on the film's [2008 50th Anniversary Edition] sound mix. As the men point out with ""before and after"" comparisons, the lack of compression has yielded hidden intricacies of the soundtrack that have been lost for decades. As Walt Disney Music President Chris Montan makes clear, the difference is quite audible, and it makes the luscious experience of the film that much better, with sound and music to match the picture.

Special Feature: Picture Perfect: The Making of Sleeping Beauty [2008] [1080p] [44:00] The centrepiece of this making-of special fresh documentary, mixes newly-discovered production footage, vintage interview material with Walt Disney, and new chats with Disney historians, animators and industry luminaries, especially among them is PIXAR's John Lasseter. It nicely encapsulates the production troubles that befell 'SLEEPING BEAUTY,' which at the time represented a considerable cost investment for Disney, as well as a shift in the studio's animation techniques, among them being the fact that this was their last hand-inked feature. Kudos to Disney for not whitewashing the story and details of wild cost overruns and internal politics are not discarded, which makes for really fascinating viewing.

Special Feature: Eyvind Earle: A Man and His Art [1080p] [8:00] Focuses squarely on the life and career of Sleeping Beauty's most talented art director Eyvind Earle who directly painted or at least supervised the production of every single background seen in the film, with incredible amounts of detail crammed into every angle.

Audio Commentary: Commentary is with PIXAR guru John Lasseter, film critic and historian Leonard Maltin, and Disney animator Andreas Deja: The trio offers a nice balance of perspective. Deja illustrates the technical aspects and changes in animation styles that 'SLEEPING BEAUTY' ushered in, as well as some behind-the-scenes Disney politics; Maltin gives his typical lavish spin on the film's legacy within the Disney canon, while John Lasseter is the most persuasive in detailing the lasting influence the film has had on the medium. Before the audio commentary starts, you get to actually see Andreas Deja, John Lasseter and Leonard Maltin in the studio with a short introduction before the start of their very nice and interesting audio commentary in conjunction with the film. You also get other original audio snippets from Walt Disney and some of the original cartoonist.

Blu-ray Sneak Previews: Disney 101 Dalmatians [Diamond Edition]; Maleficent; Disney FROZEN Sing-Along Edition; Disney PLANES: Fire & Rescue and Disney Legend of The Neverbeast.

Finally, this SLEEPING BEAUTY 2014 Diamond Edition release is filled with endless features and bonus footage taken right from the Disney Vault thats sure to excite viewers of all ages; the SLEEPING BEAUTY set includes an all new making-of documentary. Plus, it takes you further inside the pre and post-production process, serving up an alternate opening, and it is a beautiful celebration of Tchaikovsky as well as the Disney artists, along with countless other snippets that have never before been seen. This 50th Anniversary Diamond Edition is a veritable set that is a definite once upon a dream for lovers of all things Disney and especially their magical animation feature films and the treasure trove. Although, this new 2014 Diamond Edition has the same brilliant digital presentation as the 2008 Blu-ray edition, the biggest flaw is the bonus content, which sadly the Disney people have decided to drop some of the special extras from this 2014 Blu-ray release. So if you happen to own the 2008 edition, hold on to that. But if you aren't a fan of supplements or feel this will be a better upgrade, fell free to indulge in this new edition of a delightful Disney animation classic. Watching the film again, I was also struck by its script. Much of the dialogue is extremely poetic, which simply adds to the films overall mystique. Most animated films do not have particularly outstanding dialogue, but are just well-plotted. Sleeping Beauty not only has wonderful dialogue, but also improves on the overall plotting of the original piece, by reworking the original story and having Aurora and Phillip meet and fall in love before Aurora is put to sleep my Maleficents curse. There is simply so much here to appreciate, from the great script, outstanding voice talent, brilliant animation, the wonderful song Once Upon a Dream that always stays with you, and the Tchaikovsky score that is perfectly fitted to the film, despite having been composed decades before the animation films conception. SLEEPING BEAUTY is truly a masterpiece and one of the best of the Disney classics. Very Highly Recommended!

The blu-ray I used today was brighter and lightened the colors differently. It's one of my most favorite Disney films yet. It's also one of movies that's in widescreen. I see why they done it in Fullscreen, but this is better.

To me, Sleeping Beauty was a 8th birthday present that I asked my mom for. It has been a special movie for me for a good portion of my life. Upon upgrading Disney movies to blu ray, I have noticed how it is like a brand new experience. Like my blu rays of Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid -- they add a new experience paired with nostalgia.

Sleeping Beauty is a gorgeous film. The animators really do a great job editing and fine tuning all of the graphics. I recently purchased Mulan 1 & 2 set, Princess Diaries 1 & 2 set, and Enchanted. I love watching Disney movies once a year, and it is great to own them and enjoy them since I can no longer watch on VHS.",1414281600,,786,4.171052631578948

I like the darkness (theme, not color) of the movie, having a villain so evil as Maleficent with the contrast of Briar Rose, who is sweet and loving with everyone, little singing animals included.

875706,3,6304401132,"While the restoration and the film itself is amazing, the blu-ray is pretty lacking in extras. The deleted scenes are cool -- especially the original 'fair' idea, but they're all storyboards from disney archives with actors reciting the dialogue. I actually went ahead and purchased the Diamond Edition for the more robust extras collection.

If you're able to get your hands on the Diamond Edition extras yourself, that's great, but if you already own the Platinum, stick with that.",1413676800,,483,5.113924050632911

I can tell you that I really like the movie and remember it from when I was young.  I think the quality was really good and I think a good value.

The following Special Features are missing but were on the Platinum edition....I thought Diamonds were better?!?  My guess is the extra Blu-Ray disc costs Disney more $$ plus maybe not all the previous special features missing below were cleared legally in perpetuity.  So Disney decided to be cheap and expect everyone to still buy it.  Hopefully fans stand up and don't purchase this new garbage or they will keep doing this for every subsequent re-release.

876034,4,6304401132,"Disney continues its new tradition of unveiling all their classics in digitally restored high-definition with the release of Sleeping Beauty in a Diamond Edition. Having been released already in a Blu-ray format, the new version doesnt create the same sense of urgency we get when one of the vaulted titles gets its first upgrade. Mouse House devotees will still want to jump up and grab one off store shelves before they disappear.

The evil sorceress Maleficent places a curse on Princess Aurora after being slighted by the royal family. She will die by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel before her 16th birthday. The king puts his daughter in the care of three fairies who take her into hiding to keep the tragedy from occurring. Maleficent becomes obsessed with finding the girl and fulfilling her evil spell.

Sleeping Beauty Diamond Edition is presented in 1080p High-Definition with an aspect ratio of 2.55:1. The digital restoration brings out all the beauty, texture, and depth of the backgrounds and foregrounds for each scene. Its gorgeously apparent during the climactic battle sequence between the prince and Maleficent.

A 7.1 audio upgrade puts home audiences in the center of all the drama, romance, and action. The movies musical score, strong voice cast, and atmospheric sound effects place us in a fairy tale world youll want to re-visit time and time again. Its all a perfect accent to the great imagery unfolding before our very eyes.

Sleeping Beauty Diamond Edition comes with a myriad of educating and entertaining bonus material. There are several featurettes focusing on the making of the movie and the talent involved. Beauty-Oke provides children of all ages the opportunity to sing along to their favorite songs from the movie. Three deleted scenes are included as well. Some of the classic special features from the original 2008 Blu-ray release are found as well.

I was pleasantly reminded of the dark elegance of Maleficent and the strong gothic overtones presented in Sleeping Beauty. They reminded me of the atmosphere found in the underrated The Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Being a fan of horror movies, I was attracted to the last quarter of the film more so than the first three.

Disney collectors and those who never got a chance to get the Platinum Edition of Sleeping Beauty will want to rush out and grab a copy of the Diamond Edition immediately. After a window of a month or so, this new version will become scarce and youll be hard-pressed to find a copy of it anywhere. Its an essential addition to your familys home entertainment collection.",1412726400,,2626,4.956818181818182
876035,3,6304401132,"One of my all time favorites, but has anyone noticed several blurry/out of focus sequences?  It's very apparent when Phillip comes on scene (about 24-25 minutes in).

876037,5,6304401132,"""Sleeping Beauty"" has been my all-time Disney favorite, having purchased on VHS then DVD (2003 Special and limited edition and remastered it were) but I missed my chance at the Platinum editon blu-ray and refused to pay the exorbitant after market prices to update continuing to enjoy the dvd version.  The just introduced Diamond edition physically couples the last remastered for bluray and adds a dvd copy for which I paid under
$20.00 (take that gougers), and you get a digital copy for those who have
the patience.  The tale and picture are a sight for sores eyes, however one
has to admit that the picture can only be as good as the source material and while excellent as it was some of the front end titling does not come
across quite as sharp, but this is a quibble since the animation remains
gorgeous throughout.  While others may complain about that the lack of previously provided and vaulted extras are missing, there are a few new ones but the true value lays in the current availability and price point.  Gift giving price points!!!  Buy and enjoy!!!",1412726400,8,1065,4.704301075268817

876101,5,6304401132,"Look let's be honest here. Cinderella's Prince Charming was a douche. He wanted to meet a girl so he threw a party and judged all the ladies on their looks and picked one out. And after a (what I thought was) magical night, he STILL DOESN'T KNOW HER NAME. I'll just go ahead and start the egg-timer on that royal marriage. Happily ever after? Don't bet on it. It's even money on whether the marriage is over before the reception London Broil hits the lower intestines.

Now Prince Phillip. He's a true hero. Sworn to be with Aurora since her birth, he looks out for her and fights a damn dragon to the death to save her. This was a life-long commitment to protect and respect. Does Aurora get a giant castle in Orlando and her face plastered all over Disney sheets? No. Cinderella gets all the love, for what? Going to a party and looking the part. I don't remember anyone threatening Cindy's life. Do you?

Aurora and Phillip go through hell and back. Sleeping Beauty is a much better story. Maleficent is better villain. And I won't even say that Phillip is the better man, because Prince Charming is not a man. He's a spoiled child who looks for women the way I browse Amazon for socks. Even comparing Charming to Phillip would be an insult to men everywhere.",1412553600,29,1262,4.458874458874459

876103,5,6304401132,So this movie came out a few decades before I was born and a few decades later my 4 year old daughter loves the movie.  I got the platinum edition (previous release which was also on Blu ray) and I am impressed that Disney took a movie from the 50's and made it look like a movie made in the present except sleeping beauty has a quality of looking like a painting at any point if you were to press pause.

876104,1,6304401132,"This just is not a good film.
People go on and on about it as one of THE BEST classics ever made, but it really is not that good.
Te begins with a young Prince Phillip being introduced to his diaper wearing wife-to-be no matter what Princess Aurora.
Moleficent shows up at the same event still hot for Sleeping Beauty's dad King Stephan. She curses his daughter with a spinning wheel prick by her sixteenth birthday.
Don't touch a spinning wheel needle. Problem solved.
Oh the horror of dragging this out.
So, her parents unload her on a couple geriatric, incapable, clumsy fairies to raise her in the woods.
The ultimate crime of their inept behavior, Maleficent's Raven discovers there whereabouts as they draw attention to themselves in an otherwise remote local.
Enter the Prince, who eventually ((yawn)) saves the day.
The movie ends with the sixteen-year old Aurora being reintroduced to her parents so that she can immediately get married, remain shoeless and start cranking out babies for the Kingdom. More particularly, to bring their parents a greater joy than their actual kids apparently did.
Skip this movie people.
Aspiring princesses need to be exposed to more contemporary independent women sich as Rosie O'Donnell, Nancy Grace, Rachel Maddow, Kathie Gifford and my personal favorite, Jane Fonda.",1412553600,3,1312,5.050691244239632

876485,2,6304401132,In nearly 20 years of being a fan of this movie I've never been more disappointed after watching it. I had such high hopes for the Blu-Ray release of this movie and the Dolby DTS 7.1 Surround sound it was remastered in. So much could have been done for the sound effects for this movie that was not done. Disney did a LACKLUSTER job overall and flagrantly under-delivered with the sound. I understand that the movie is from 1959 but thats no excuse don't dub a movie in the same output as a Jurassic Park and then flagranty drop the ball with sound. Disney DROPPED the BALL bigtime!!!!,1405382400,,585,4.425925925925926

I know that soon Disney will probably release this again in a blue ray format or something comparable to generate more sales. My 8 yr. old daughter loved it as she had never seen it before. I was a little dissapointed though to receive a used copy of this movie, not a new one. I guess that was my fault, I was sure that this was advertised as a new copy.

876591,5,6304401132,"Most of us know this fairy tale because of Walt Disney's animated cartoon.  But there are so many ways for your children to experience it.  I looked for picture books (at a very affordable price through Amazon's used book sales).  There was more than one adaptation with beautiful art work and variations on the theme to share with the children.  Sleeping Beauty is also a beautiful ballet.  Your can find and excellent performance by world reknown ballet troups through the Amazon used tape or DVD outlet at a really affordable price.  Or more than one to show how different choreographers, set designers, composers, etc. vary the theme.  What little girl doesn't want to put on a tutu and dance.  Again, affordable tutus through Amazon.

This particular old tape was as much fun for me to view as to introduce to the children.  Afterward we watched the Disney animation.  My grandchildren decided they like the live performance better.  Who knew?!",1403827200,,949,4.89937106918239

Even better, were the  special features and learning about all the facets that went into production and the personal stories that help make it a timeless classic.  Renewed interest came as a result of the release of the new film ""Maleficent"" for which I needed a refresher on the original story to fully appreciate the differences.

If you scroll down and read the VERY FINE PRINT, it says the item is a CD.  I felt that because they advertised the CD with a photo of the DVD, this was very misleading.  In any case, I contacted them to arrange a return, and they sent me a detailed explanation that I would need to pay to ship AND insure the item, as well as pay a 15% restocking fee.  By the time I did that, I would've paid twice for the item.

876937,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Disney movie ever! Everything about it, from the princess, the villain, characters, art animation, music... its all total perfection. A true Walt Disney MASTERPIECE.

  Aurora our princess is beautiful on the inside as well as on the outside. If she was really overly lovesick, she would have just ran off the moment she met Phillip. But she didn't. Instead she goes back home and tells her Godmothers about him. She get's upset when she finds out her true identity, she doesn't want to marry some prince she's never met. YET she puts her trust in her family, the Fairy Godmothers. If anything shes self sacrificing. She puts her dream to the side to please others. :D Being the girly girl that I am, I think Prince Phillip is the best prince. He does the most. Slays a dragon and wakes Aurora up from her cursed sleep. So dreamy!!! Flora, Fauna and Merryweather (The Three Good Fairies) take over the movie. Some say that the movie should be named after them instead of Sleeping Beauty lol. They stop Maleficents curse of death and turn it into a mere deep sleep that could be broken by true loves first kiss, Raise Aurora as their own, Save prince Phillip and assist him in slaying Maleficent. These fairies are heros! And of course we can't forget Maleficent. The BEST Disney villain ever. So elegant and deliciously evil. When I was little, Maleficent was the only Disney villain who actually scared me. The scene were Maleficent hypnotizes and lures Aurora into the fireplace and up the tower... creepy.

  I love how traditional the whole plot of this movie is. Every woman has had that one dream with a love interest in it. Let's not lie here. That one dream you have when you meet that totally perfect handsome stranger you can't keep your hands off. We can all relate with Aurora on that. '' Well, hes tall and handsome and.. soo romantic. We walk together and talk together, and just before we say goodbye.. he takes me in his arms.. and then.... I wake up''. We've all been there.",1394236800,,2022,4.618384401114207

877082,3,6304401132,"Though I did and do like Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"", I think it is one of the less remarkable films made by the studios. If you only look at the scenery backgrounds, these are perfectly stunning: but the rest doesn't really fit. This could have been a great film, but it fails in too many points.

Although Tchaikovsky's ballet score is well matched up with the animation, the songs are insipid. Only the love theme sounds good, and Aurora's vocalizing in the woods.
The plot holes are too blatant to be overlooked. What is Maleficent's problem? The motivation of e.g. Snow White's stepmother is obvious and understandable. But this entire act of revenge, pursued for 16 years, because she wasn't invited to the princess' baby shower?
The fairies hide Aurora in the woods until shortly before the night of her 16th birthday. They are always careful that she never meets anyone and protect her to an inch of her life. Then, the fatal evening, they leave her ALONE during the last minutes.
The scene where the fairies awkwardly try to sew and bake for Aurora's birthday is one of the best, but please: didn't they learn how to sew and bake during the last 16 years? How on earth did they survive, and grow a baby girl, too?
The fairies, so they say, can't do any evil magic, only ""good"" one. During the final battle Merryweather turns Maleficent's raven to stone, and later all three of them help Philip kill the dragon by lending magical power to his sword.
The dying dragon falls on a ledge right near Philip, tearing down most of it; of course, he is neither pulled down with her nor does he even get dust into his eyes.

The characters are almost all flat and predictable; no wonder Maleficent is an all-time-favourite with the viewers, she is the only one who has some depth and charisma. Nevertheless, I still don't really understand her inherent motivation, but o.k., she's the villain, I guess she must simply be evil for evil's sake.
Some more originality for Aurora's character would have been highly appreciated, in particular when the fairies have the power to bestow some unique gift on her. All Disney princesses are beautiful and sing well, there's nothing special in that.
Prince Philip is a little more interesting than Snow White's and Cinderella's princes (the studios even gave him a first name :-), he isn't only charming but sometimes he is fun, and in the end he can prove himself bold and brave.
Though the fairies are amiable characters, they don't seem to know their place. Maybe that's the story's worst fault: allowing the sidekicks to be more important for the plot than the protagonists. Not only do they carry the baby girl away from her parents and grow her in their stead; they meddle right through the final showdown, which should have been Philip's great performance, his chance to prove himself and his ""true love"". First they free Philip and give him shield and sword, then they lead and assist him all the time while he fights; at the end of his fight with the dragon they even put a spell on the sword to help him. Must that be? It was a good thing that Philip had some more character than the princes before him, but can't he do anything heroic on his own?

Additionally, this film is to me one of the creepiest Disney ever made. Just watch the scenes at Maleficent's castle, with the demonic imps dancing round the fire; the scene of her first apparition and the curse, or the one where Maleficent lures Aurora to the room where the spinning wheel stands. It must be pretty scary to a child.

I only hope the Disney film studios learned as much from this film as they could - which is, a good film is made of the characters and the story, and no superb pictures and classical music can save it if the characters are stereotypical and the story uninspired. I can't say I dislike ""Sleeping Beauty"", but it is certainly not one of my favourites.",1391040000,,3881,4.604046242774566

(If you've somehow never seen this before, *spoiler* warning.)
After Aurora pricks her finger on the spinning wheel, we see the good fairies crying over her up in the castle tower. Well, they know that true love's kiss will revive her, and just a few hours before she told them she met a man in the forest. One of them even remarked that she was in love. Furthermore, Aurora said he would be meeting her that night. Why, then, do the fairies not take her back to the cottage to meet him? It doesn't matter if he's not the prince--whoever he is, they know she's in love and that all he has to do is kiss her. When this dawned on me, I thought, ""There's no reason to be crying over her. Just take her to that guy!"" Of course, that would've made a very short film.",1388966400,,1152,4.240909090909091

877307,5,6304401132,"After 9 long years since watching this movie on VHS, I decided to check this out on Platinum Edition Blu-ray from my library, and I was simply blown away. As a graphic design student, this movie is such an inspiration in terms of artistic beauty. After viewing this incredible wonder, I decided to pick up two copies of the movie on VHS during a trip to my local thrift shop. I purchased the original black diamond ""Classic"" edition, and the Limited Edition remastered version as well. The difference between these two and the Blu-ray is night and day. First of all, the new version is shown in its original format, which makes it a little thin and long on normal TVs, but still entirely viewable (it would look fantastic on a wide-screen HDTV, but unfortunately I can't afford such a lavish thing). The original releases ended up cutting off a lot of the picture on the sides, and while you can still see all of the important things on screen, the gorgeous backgrounds are butchered by this format. It's entirely worth upgrading from your old VHS tape for this reason alone. The movie has also been digitally remastered to the highest quality available, and it looks and sounds brand new. The beautiful ballet soundtrack sounds wonderful, and not a song feels contrived or out of place. This Platinum Edition has many bonus features, as well, such as a digital tour of an old Disney attraction, the making of the movie, the short Grand Canyon feature that showed before the movie in theaters (which I personally thought was a bit boring), a visual and audio sensory trip into Maleficent's dungeon, and others. The ""Making Of"" feature, and the digital attraction are probably the best features in the set, but the sensory trip was also interesting, although the three fairy's voices aren't quite right and Maleficent's 3D model looks silly against the detailed backgrounds. Overall, if you've missed out on this masterpiece entirely, or if you're looking for inspiration, or even if you just want to watch the movie yourself or to show it to your kids, the Blu-ray edition is the best way to go in order to fully enjoy this gorgeous film. Disney proves time and time again that it isn't just for kids and the weak of heart; it's there for everyone looking for that little something special, that magic in life. And what better way to experience that magic than with Sleeping Beauty?",1387929600,,2382,4.742168674698795

I love the songs, and the clothing. Even after all this time I can look at my mother and say ""Make it Blue"" and she'll say ""Make it Pink"" and visa versa. There are some scenes that are not pleasant for children, like when the fathers are getting really drunk and so is the gesture, and it is very obvious.

The story of Sleeping Beauty is amazing, and is retold in so many ways and has so many origins. I love that they refer to Aurora as Brier Rose, since East of the Sun, West of the Moon was an original version of Sleeping Beauty and that was her name in it.

It is so much shorter than I remember it being when I was younger, but many early Disney cartoons I am finding are short, probably because it was fully hand drawn back then.

This is a great movie, if you haven't seen it you should. Even to this day I can look at my mother and say ""Make it Blue"", and she'll reply ""Make it Pink!"" and Visa Versa.",1387238400,,716,4.0

877417,4,6304401132,"Great movie, great sound, but menu layout, missing content from previous 2003 release, and some weird restoration hiccups make this less than perfect. I'm not going to get into the greatness of the movie since everyone knows already. My problems I have with it begins with the menu layout of the Blu-ray/DVD. If you compare the layout with the 2003 release, the new menu system is terrible. For the Blu-ray versions, it starts off with an animated picture of the castle. The weather changes randomly, and has a small menu showing, I think, different weather statuses for different Disney theme parks around the world? There's nothing telling you what this is and getting to the menu is confusing since the only thing that lights up letting you know the cursor got to the weather menu is a tiny triangle at the bottom. It then opens up a world map and lets you click on a location of a theme park, but nothing changes for the castle, making this completely pointless (by the way, my BD player is always connected to the internet). The real menu on the screen, that is for watching the movie, is small and basically pointless since one of the options is to open up a bigger version of the menu, in a different screen, where you can set-up the movie's audio and subtitles. The new screen for the bigger menu is very boring with not a lot of thought put into it compared to the menus of the 2003 release. The text for the menus is very small, including descriptions for each option. Unfortunately, this is the same for the second Blu-ray disc that houses that extra content. For the extra content itself, I think most of the content of the 2003 release was put on this release, but I noticed for at least the art gallery section, some drawings and other pieces that were included in the 2003 release, were not put on this release for some reason.
Lastly, the restoration is great for the most part but there are some weird changes made from the 2003 restoration. One change is very obvious; it's the scene where Maleficent crashes the christening. There is a close up of her laughing, but oddly, she has white eyes instead of the deep yellow eyes she always has in every other scene. In the 2003 restoration, her eyes are yellow, just like you would expect. Another example is the scene King Stefan and King Hubert celebrating the Aurora's return. The page that enters to show the future castle plans has always worn light green clothes. This new restoration changed his clothes to a yellow, which is fine, but before the page is put to sleep by the fairies' spell, his clothes are back to light green (then put to a dark green along with everything else). A third example is when Aurora becomes hypnotized by Maleficent's spell. The light shines on her and the background is green,  but her lighting has a different color or shade, making it look odd compared to the background's lighting. This isn't present in the 2003 release. Lastly, the brightness of the characters' colors are too bright to the point that you can't see a difference in hue, especially for their clothes. This appears to of happened due to the increased brightness they put when restoring every scene. I've only found one audio hiccup, it's the scene where the fairies are secretly planning on how to protect the princess from the curse. When Flora finally comes up with her plan, she waves her wand, tapping a ruby below. In the 2003 release, there is a distinct tapping sound done, but in this new release, the tapping sound is gone! What happened to it? Very weird, but hopefully the next release will correct all these mess-ups so that we can see the film as originally intended.",1384560000,2,3652,4.609831029185868

877560,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is one hour and fifteen minutes and was released in theaters on January 29, 1959. The story is that an evil witch named Maleficent put a curse on King Stefan and Queen Leah infant child named Aurora. The curse was that Aurora would prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel before the sun set on her sixteenth birthday. The three good fairies disguised as mortal take her to a cottage in the woods where she grew up and went by the name Briar Rose. Since this is a Disney movie we now the rest of the story and the happy ending. This was the first Disney movie filmed in 70mm format or what we would call today wide screen. This would be the last Disney movie inked by hand. From 101 Dalmatians on, every animated movie would be were xeroxed onto the cels. On last fact about Sleeping Beauty at the time it was the most expensive movie to make at a cost of six million dollars.

My biggest beef about this two DVD set is the overkill of information. In Disc 2 the Games, Music, & Fun is fun for kids but when you the History & Behind the Scene (mostly geared to adults) is too much information. It took me over two hours to go through that whole thing and after watching no more of five minutes of The Peter Tchaikovsky Story I turned the special off. Just see below look below at what you get. I cannot imagine a parent going to her daughter and saying ""hey little girlie lets watch all of disk two"". The poor girl would wind up committed in a mental sanatorium. Overall Sleeping Beauty (the movie only) is a great family movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.

877624,5,6304401132,"Disney Studios 16th full length animated feature film is one of my favorites. Sleeping Beauty is one of the studios most ambitious with absolutely stunning animation and released on Blu Ray in a stunning 2.55:1 aspect ratio transfer (the film's original aspect ratio). This is Disney's best Princess movie and certainly a step up after the Lady and the Tramp which seemed ordinary when compared with the animated full length feature films that came before it.

The film looks amazing on Blu Ray as flawless as I can imagine it could look, the colors pop even more on this sparkling Blu Ray treatment than ever before. The characters seem to be overshadowed by Disney's breathtaking artistry with comedic elements kept to a minimum here. The extras are plentiful and about as good as you could expect with all noteworthy past features carried over.

The film has never looked or sounded better and I doubt if ever will get better than this, so if you're a fan, buy it! It's one of Disney's best releases to Blu Ray so far. I own the Steelbook Edition and the packaging it fantastic!

If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.",1377475200,2,1156,4.6292682926829265

878167,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is one of my personal favorite Disney films next to ''Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''. Sleeping Beauty is a beautiful and colorful movie with lovely songs. The three fairies are so sweet and lovable, and they are major characters in the story.

The movie is about a king and queen who have a daughter. They call her Aurora. During a ceremony celebrating the birth of the Princess, three sweet fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather bless the Princess with a different gift each. When Merryweather is about to bless the Princess, an evil fairy named Maleficent appears at the ceremony. She then curses the Princess. She casts a spell and says that before the sun sets on her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and then she will die. Maleficent escapes, then Merryweather must bless the Princess with a gift that will be able to save her. She casts a spell saying that when she pricks her finger, she will only sleep, and when she gets a kiss from a true love, the spell will break.

The fairies then take the Princess away from the King and Queen to hide her. They spend 16 years with her and live as normal humans without magic, and they call her Briar Rose. On the Princess's 16th birthday, she goes in the forest and meets a Prince, but she doesn't know he is one, and he doesn't know she's the Princess. They fall in love, but then she rushes back home and tells him to meet her there at night.

The fairies then have to bring the Princess back to the castle and they tell her who she really is. When she is in the castle, Maleficent takes control of her and she pricks her finger on a spindle. The fairies then put everyone in the castle to sleep until the Princess can be awakened. While this is happening, Maleficent kidnaps the Prince.

The fairies go to the forbidden mountain and free the Prince, then they give him a sword and shield. He must then destroy Maleficent and save the Princess.

So for her birthday party, you guessed.. themed Sleeping Beauty..
she got for a gift her very own dvd and the most beautiful Disney Store Disney Princess Darlings Magic Castle Play Set with Aurora and Phillip Dolls. She was simply mesmerized. Both gifts complemented each other in such an amazing way.
Whenever she watches the movie she will set up the castle to play with and the other way around.
The movie is timeless classic. It is one of those stories we hear from early childhood and the disc is well worth the money. Please be careful showing to a little one under 5 as some kids at this age do not  distinguish between fantasy and imagination and reality and some scenes might be freighting. I would strongly advise parental guidance and watch prior to showing little one and then watch with her and forward what is scary until you know she is mature enough not to worry about the scary parts. This is true to all Disney Princess movies, and still so worth experiencing as they are timeless and beautiful stories.",1367884800,,1090,4.618556701030927

878594,3,6304401132,"I actually rate this 3.5 stars. I remember seeing this as a kid and noticing that the characters were drawn flat and there didn't seem to be as much attention to detail as in previous Disney films! A lot of the townspeople and palace guards are drawn VERY cartoonish! The color is gorgeous though and this was the first Disney animated film to use the widescreen process of Technirama 70 with stereophonic sound, although Disney's previous animated film, ""Lady And The Tramp"" was filmed in CinemaScope. The beautiful Tchaikovsky score isn't used to it's best advantage, mainly just the more sinister sections. But Mary Costa does a beautiful job with, ""I Know You""! In fact The only meeting we really have with Aurora, (Sleeping Beauty), is with her singing this song with the forest animals, until the prince overhears her while riding through the forest. It's charming but that's not enough time to get to know her. The focus is more on the good fairy's... Also, this is one of the few Disney films where a ""Prince Charming"" has a lot more screen time than the heroine! Nevertheless, this film has enough to recommend it, although the evil Maleficent might be too scary for very little kids. I tried to show this to my four year old niece and she went running from the room in terror as soon as Maleficent appeared!
Even though I've been a little harsh, this film definitely has enough charm for family viewing and age appropriate children!",1361836800,,1442,4.726190476190476
878595,5,6304401132,"... I would suggest choosing this one.  This thing looks un-dadgum-real on Blu-ray disc.  It's not in my top 10 favorite Disney films, but it is my absolute favorite high definition presentation.  A lot of things converged to make the look so stunning.  They spent a ton of money and time on the film, they departed from the old Disney look and used instead a medieval aesthetic, and they widened the screen by a lot compared with the typical animated films.  (Listen to the audio commentary and you'll be blown away by what all went into making it look so incredible ... sometimes they'd complete one drawing in a day, which is good for ONE TWENTY-FOURTH OF ONE SECOND of film time!).

Anyway, the Blu-ray Disney presentations I've seen are this one, Aristocats, Lady and the Tramp, and Cinderella.  And none of those other titles come anywhere near this one (even though they're all good).  Watching this, I was literally shaking my head in disbelief at what I was seeing.

I can't compare it to Blu-rays like Beauty and the Beast and Lion King, which I'm sure must look amazing, too.  But this is like watching high art from some museum getting lit up and moved all around in front of you.  It's just jaw-dropping.  I'm glad I didn't ignore it just because I find the story a bit vanilla.  And actually, the story, and especially some of the dialogue, is better than I remembered.",1361577600,,1383,4.595918367346939

I was under the impression that I would be receiving something that looks new as it was deemed on the packaging. It was also just the blu ray case with the dvd sleeve taped over the case.

But on the day of the infant's christening, with nobility and the gentry in attendance to pay her homage, Maleficent, the wicked fairy, crashes the party, and, offended at not being invited, curses Aurora to ""prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel--and die!""  Though the youngest of the three Good Fairies is able to blunt the curse, she and her sisters resolve to smuggle the baby away to the forest and raise her in secret, where they can keep an eye on her.  But Maleficent hasn't given up...

Of course there'd be no story without Aurora (Mary Costa), but as a heroine she's rather ineffectual and insipid; unlike various other Disney ""princesses""--Snow White, Cinderella, and Belle leap immediately to mind--she doesn't have much to do except to fall in love at first sight with Prince Philip (Bill Shirley) and fall into a magical sleep.  The story is really carried by the Good Fairies--practical Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen), slightly vague Flora (Verna Felton), and quick-tempered Merryweather (barbara Luddy)--and, as is often the case in Disney animation, by the villain, the magnificent Maleficent, self-named ""the mistress of all evil"" (splendidly voiced by character actress Eleanor Audley, who also did the Stepmother in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella/dp/B00AAIHWYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella</a>).  The animation is richly done (the scenes at Stefan's court are especially lavish, though Maleficent's spooky tumbledown castle in the Forbidden Mountains is equally good in its own way), and Philip's battle to reach his sleeping love--through a forest of thorns and Maleficent in the form of a dragon--is still thrilling.",1354752000,,1979,5.5364238410596025

Like I said the quality of the Blue- Ray was excellent and u can't find the original since Disney repossess their Classic movies , which I think causes this copies to be made ...

879392,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is one of the most ambitious animated films ever made. It took Walt Disney the entire 50's decade to finish it and the final results where both breathtaking and different from anything that was done before or after. Sleeping Beauty is truly a class-apart film.

From its detailed and lush backgrounds, its defined characters, superb score and intense action, Sleeping Beauty is a true classic that offers very high quality entertainment. The plot might be thin and predictable but its truly a joy to watch. The characters are very well delineated and you invest and care for them. Many critics have said that the heroine is a very passive girl with not much to do or say but I think it serves the story right as the big stars here are the three fairies and Maleficent who carried the picture in a wonderful way.

Sleeping Beauty has been always lovely to look at but now in this BD is something truly spectacular!!

Video & Audio
Sleeping Beauty was the first hand-drawn animated film to debut on BD from Disney and the results are truly wonderful. The detail, the colors, the contrast everything is so clear and clean that you will want to see it again and again. Also, there are not any traces of banding, artifacts and other distractions. Simply amazing!

The restored audio is offered via a 7.1 DTS-HD MA and is just glorious! There are no distortions and directionality is spot-on. A demo worthy experience from a 53 year old film.

Bonus Material

Sleeping Beauty comes in a 2-disc set and comes fully loaded with wonderful bonus features:

In Disc 1 you have the movie, a cine-explore feature, an audio commentary, The Grand Canyon Documentary and some games.

Disc 2 comes with a making of documentary, alternate opening, games, deleted music, The Peter Tchaikovski story, a tribute to Eyvind Earle, galleries, publicity and more.

Everything is very informative and a must-see.

A DVD of the film is also included.

Closing Thoughts

Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's most iconic classic and is certainly its most lavish and opulent one. With breathtaking scenarios, a great story, wonderful music and wonderful characters, Sleeping Beauty is a must-own film. This BD is absolutely spectacular with top-notch picture and sound and lots of excellent bonus material. Highly Recommended!!",1341792000,,2311,4.927835051546392

Although the story is timeless, the music and singing are very operatic, which is fine because it was so well done. Indeed, it's great to have a mix of styles within our Disney Collection. Besides, how can a kid really enjoy Sleeping Beauty's Castle at Disneyland and on every Disney movie if they don't see this wonderful story?",1340150400,,487,4.545454545454546

879476,3,6304401132,"For those not familiar with how Blu-rays work, they have what is called a ""pop-up"" menu which is a menu that you can bring up without exiting the movie.  Sometimes though, the pop-up menu and other features don't work as they should and in this case the pop-up menu doesn't always come up when I hit the button, and it requires bringing up the ""top menu"" which is like the menu on a standard DVD. But every time I do this, it goes back to the beginning of the movie and I have to navigate back to where I was and there are also loading screens between the menu and the movie.",1339200000,,575,4.133928571428571
879477,5,6304401132,"When this came out in the theatres back in the 50's, I was sort of taken aback by the ""strange"" animation depicted on screen, having really grown up on PINOCCHIO and the like.  Of course, seeing the entire screen filled with the incredible colors and hearing the sound from every corner of the theatre did set a new high mark for Disney and their world of animation.

Years later a copy, non wide screen, was released on video, then came a ""partial"" expansion, and finally, the original aspect ratio was allowed to fill the screen on DVD, with the advent of large screen t.v.'s.

And now, the presentation of SLEEPING BEAUTY on Blu-ray brings the history (for me, anyway) full circle, though not QUITE as large as the original.

Mary Costa (of old ""live"" t.v. commercials for refrigerators and Chrysler Corporation's cars, and the first Cunegonde in the national tour of Bernstein's CANDIDE right after it closed on Broadway and concert versioned across the US) brings her crystalline voice to full force as Aurora on the 7.1 soundtrack (although her Metropolitan Opera tour as Musetta in La Boheme was quite a tour de force without amplification).  And of course, the film itself is reproduced for the blu ray disc in high definition...quite a visual treat.  AND, you can practice your French or Spanish with alternate soundtracks.

So, I'm happy.  I also found a re-seller through Amazon who sent me a spotless, good as new package of the film.  For anyone wanting to experience a beautiful hommage to medieval hour books, take a look at this film....and enjoy an addition to the incredible Disney villains with a dragon who just won't quit.  Maleficent indeed.",1339113600,,1663,4.84452296819788

879565,3,6304401132,"This is one I really had not seen before. It was in theaters when I was 12 years old, and clearly too mature for such things, at least when they cost money. I have seen stills and short segments from it, probably on the Disney TV show, but I know I never saw the whole thing.

The art is quite a departure from earlier Disney animation, and indeed looks like it may have been a cost-cutting measure. It's quite angular in style, and uses a lot more flat, unrealistic backgrounds and crowd scenes. Princess Aurora is pretty enough, and the Prince Philip is handsome, but they don't have fully rounded, shaded features. The look like flat cartoons.

The story is of course the familiar traditional one, adapted as Disney always does adapt. Princess is born after long years of wanting by the King and Queen, at which point she is betrothed to the boy prince from the neighboring kingdom, Prince Philip. Her three fairy godmothers can each offer her one gift. The first offers her great beauty, the second a marvelous singing voice, and just as the third is about to bestow her gift, the evil witch, Malificent, shows up and pronounces a curse. The third fairy godmother attempts to mitigate the curse, but for security, her fairy godmothers give up magic to take her into the forest to be raised anonymously. They give her the name Briar Rose.

The curse was to take effect on her 16th birthday, ""before the sun sets,"" so of course she has to meet the handsome prince in the forest the day before. She doesn't know who he is and he doesn't know who she is, but of course they fall in love. Each one is then chastised for shirking their duty to marry royalty, without anyone ever guessing that they both are royalty, and are in fact betrothed.

Hard to believe, but so it the ease with which Malificent is overthrown. Then Aurora is awakened by Loves First Kiss, and everything is la la la. With better art, and better advantage made of Tchaikovsky's marvelous Sleeping Beauty ballet, I might have more respect.",1336608000,2,2008,4.569444444444445

I just think they're more into the Disney movies with lots of action and songs(Toy Story, Tangled, Princess and the frog). Overall, it's a beautiful movie.",1336176000,,438,4.289156626506024

879573,5,6304401132,"Two things stand out to me watching this film as an adult:

1. How is it possible that after 16 years of living like mortals, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather have no clue how to bake or sew? There's no reason they should have gotten caught.
2. Why did they take Aurora back to the castle on her 16th birthday? After all those years of heartbreaking separation, 16 years and one day seems like no big deal and a lot safer.

I love this movie because Maleficent is my favorite Disney villain. She is pure evil, but she is an amazing work of art. Disney always makes their villains so creative. The princesses usually look alike: small nose and chin, big eyes, long hair (typically), and a perfect body. Sidekicks and smaller characters are a little more unique: they get the big noses, huge chins, short squishy bodies, and proportions that even the most unattractive real-life people are not unfortunate enough to be blessed with. But the villains... they range from amazing to creative to unique to just plain weird. (Look at someone like Yzma in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Emperor-s-New-Groove/dp/B0060CV31C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Emperor's New Groove</a>!) But Maleficent is the one who has always fascinated me the most. She's gorgeous even though she looks like a devil. There are times when you can't help sympathizing with her even though she's the bad guy. It's because you can tell she's lonely. And, like the fairies put it, she does not understand love. She has never been loved.

Besides that, Eleanor Audley does the most amazing job ever as Maleficent. She's the quintessential villain voice. I guess that is why they used her again for the wicked stepmother in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007Z9R7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>... another favorite villain of mine. It's a shame that they did Cinderella III so many years later that none of the original actors were around. Although whoever did the stepmother's voice did a pretty decent imitation. (I really think there should be a time limit on sequels. Cinderella III was OK but Cinderella II totally sucked.) Oh, and if you ever watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Acres-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0000V4906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Acres: The Complete First Season</a>, you will not be able to watch Eleanor Audley without hearing Maleficent!",1332720000,,2558,5.908108108108108

The only problem with the copy that I got was that I had ordered a used one to include the DVD as well as Blue Ray.  All of the disks were included, but the cover was only for the blue ray and the DVD copy came in a paper sleeve inside it.

The story is great too, It's a classic, if you are a boy or a girl it doesn't matter, each can relate.

879961,2,6304401132,"Whoever ""enhanced"" the colors in this version of Sleeping Beauty ruined them.  The Princess either drinks too much or spent quality time with solar radiation because her skin glows pink - when it is not disconcertingly changing color.  You can see an example of the type of completely awful skin discoloration I mean in one of the pictures posted above on the listing: the three fairies looking into the cradle.  Okay, so maybe fairies have unnatural skin, but everyone else?  Notice that in that picture the wood of the cradle is pink too.  I know little girls love pink, but did they have to tint EVERYTHING that color?)

If you watch the commercial for this where they show the original coloration and the ""enhanced"" version side by side, it's pretty obvious the original colors look more natural.  The enhanced stuff looks florescent.  It would be bad enough if that's all that was wrong, but they didn't keep it even.  Things change tint at random, sometimes when all they're doing is just standing there.  If you have a choice, get the older version of this - skip the ""new, enhanced"" hack job.",1318464000,2,1100,4.712041884816754

I did have a problem with my order however.  When i first ordered this movie, it said ""New Condition"", which is Factory Sealed and most likely with a cardboard sleeve.  I patiently and eagerly awaited for it by mail.  I received it only to be disappointed.  It was not sealed, had not sleeve, had the DVD version just put in the case, and some obvious wear and tear.  I paid what I thought was a new price for this movie.  I contacted the company, which took me a couple days.  Once I finally got a hold of them, I explained my situation and they were very helpful.  In the end, I returned my first copy of Sleeping Beauty and ordered another copy.  When I finally received this copy from another company, it was great and up to my expectations.  The moral of the story is that it may say ""New Condition"" but when buying from anyone but Amazon there is a higher risk that it might not be as advertised.

Overall, I am completely satisfied with my product, once I received the copy that met my expectations.  My copy had the cardboard sleeve which had no damage whatsoever.  The discs were not scratched and it was wrapped in original factory plastic.  One thing to mention is with this combo pack, Disney sloppily put the DVD version in a cardboard sleeve and stuck it in the plastic wrap around the case.

Sleeping Beauty will transform your home into a fantasitc world your family will want to experience again and again.

This 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition release of Sleeping Beauty, as a 2-disc DVD is the first entry in the Platinum Edition line to be released in high definition video. The new restoration features the film in its full negative aspect ratio of 2.55:1, wider than both the prints shown at the film's original limited Technirama engagements in 2.20:1 and the CinemaScope-compatible reduction prints for general release at 2.35:1.

Film Backround: Sleeping Beauty is a 1959 animated film produced by Walt Disney and based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. The film spent nearly the entire decade of the 1950s in production: the story work began in 1951, voices were recorded in 1952, animation production took from 1953 until 1958, and the musical score, mostly based on Tchaikovsky's ballet of the same name, was recorded in 1957. Sleeping Beauty's production costs, which totaled $6 million, made it the most expensive Disney film up to that point, and over twice as expensive as each of the preceding three Disney animated features. Sleeping Beauty's successful reissues have made it the second most successful film released in 1959, second to Ben-Hur.",1311033600,,1624,5.315175097276264

880169,5,6304401132,"My earliest memory is sitting on the couch watching this film in our living room on a Saturday afternoon. The moment I heard the ethereal vocals of Mary Costa as Briar Rose began her route into the forest, I became forever entranced by the magic of Disney animated storytelling. This film marks my first and most influential memory (I was not even 4). I was born (as my pen name indicates) right at the dawn of the Disney Renaissance which began with The Little Mermaid in 1989 and ended with Tarzan in 1999. So you would expect me to prefer something like The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast over something from three decades earlier, but behold, I was blessed with parents who failed to take me to see those films before introducing me to the classics they had begun purchasing on VHS as soon as I was born (Sleeping Beauty, Pinnochio, The Great Mouse Detective, The Rescuers Down Under, Robin Hood, The Sword and the Stone, ect). The first film I saw in theaters was Aladdin(1992), and that was an experience in and of itself, but what its ultimate effect ended up being was an acute disappointment that I never got to see my first love on the wall-spanning theater screen. How thrilling it would have been to see Prince Phillip battle Maleficent with the George-Bruns-adapted-Tchaikovsky score blasting through the speakers!

If you love classical music, if you are any kind of romantic, and most of all, if you value the innocence and grandeur of the Disney Classics, then you need to add this film to your library! Anyone who claims this film is boring was deprived of artistic appreciation in their life and lacks innocence, which is their very great misfortune. You could pause this film at any point, print out the image, frame it, hang it up on your wall, and visitors would almost swear you had a masterpiece in your home. What the story does (admittedly) lack in character development and plot depth is more than compensated for in the artistic design and scope alone. Let us not even begin to get into the brilliant score composed by the masterful and gifted Peter Tchaikovsky! This is a fairytale beloved by generations, and despite criticism on Disney's ""romanticizing"" of the classic folktales of Western culture, I dare anyone to name another film version of this story, if one exists that comes even close to creating the same effect on the audience in any aspect! I am inclined to believe that no such version (animated or live-action) can raise their hand because this film tops them all...it was and to this day, still is, the pinnacle of achievement in animation.

You do not have to get so involved with the ""story"" to be able to enjoy this film. Watching Sleeping Beauty is like going to the symphony or being able to value and appreciate art in any form. And for all the naysayers complaining, the morality and presentation of the characters is still communicated effectively. Aurora is innocent, yet exudes a grace and maturity that is unheard of in Disney heroines. Prince Phillip is the prototype prince for all the rest: daring, dignified, yet down-to-earth. The three good fairies are as warm, affectionate, and kind-hearted as any doting grandmother could be, and last, but certainly not least, Maleficent is the epitome of evil and cruelty. She doesn't have to have a reason to show up and cause havoc in King Stephan's realm...her performance at the christening party was just for show! She is evil because she loves evil and hates everything affiliated with good. With the notable exception of Chernabog from Fantasia(1940), you cannot find a more similar representation of Satan, himself. And any individual who plans to kidnap your betrothed and keep him away from you until he is old and decrepit is a prime definition of cruel and unusual punishment! Finally, the battle between Phillip and our archvillainess is the confirmation that, even with the advent of the computer, animators are STILL trying to top the look of this film. I rode home on a bus with my basketball team one week from a tournament a few years ago and had brought a handful of movies to watch on the way...most of them iconic classics I might add (Gone With the Wind, Sound of Music ect.). They voted on Sleeping Beauty, and most of them hadn't seen the film for a good ten years. By the finale, even my coaches were thanking me for picking this movie! I could tell they were impressed!

If you have a spare couple of hours on the weekend, give this film a go, yes, even if you do not have a little girl who is less than 8 years old nearby. Sleeping Beauty's overlaying message that ""love conquers all"" is more adequately communicated through the audio and visual presentation than the most complex romantic comedy or raunchiest tv drama ever!",1310428800,,4754,4.718411552346571

880173,4,6304401132,"Disney considered this to be his magnum opus trying to expand on the merits of previous films later admitting this to be very flawed for something that was to be considered Disney's greatest. Firstly conflicting interests in more ambitious more publicity driven endeavors through the space race with Russia and the endeavors through Disneyland make them invest only so much in this production. What they do invest essentially does not flesh out the whole film it is uneven and choppy due to conflicting artistic interests. Firstly they want a naive sixteen year old princess but the angular style reminiscent of UPA and Warner Bros. in order to stylistically change their direction. The stylistic change prohibits such a design of a juvenile naive sixteen year old virgin, as she looks more mature and aware and developed than this. Because Walt wanted both he essentially sacrifices and endurable princess character for a style that differs from past Disney endeavors which although distinct character development suffers. Again she is developed to a completely different direction and is not sympathetic because her awareness makes it seem that all of her hardships she brings upon herself.

Further more another problem with this project is that the only really well fleshed out character is Eleanor Audley's Maleficent. The voice delivery for her is perfect and is an exceptional expansion on what made the Snow White Queen so endurable. However this film becomes more of a character study and vehicle for her and is told from her perspective so I laugh at the idea that they are trying to make a new spin on Sleeping Beauty with Tim Burton when this concept was essentially executed in the original. They neglect to flesh out the other characters which makes this film depressing seeing her as the only compelling character. The only reason you empathize with the cast is because you share a common enemy in Maleficent she is malevolence taken to its extremes in a fictional sense. She seems to intimidate and scare people through her firmness and seductive appearance initially as she is to frail to look as if she is any physical threat. Though when it comes to character study as we notice as the film progresses she becomes more erratic her physical appearance deteriorates in the sixteen years she searches for Aurora. Character Study is so effective for her exclusively that she is the only one who really progresses throughout the film.

Aurora herself has to many mature physical features to convey herself as a naive sixteen year old virgin she is reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn which Marc Davis derived much of his influence for Aurora from as this was stated before. The whole Sixteen Year old concept was used in much greater effect with Snow White but probably at its zenith with Glen Keane's Aeriel in The Little Mermaid. The two female leads seem to be based on Hollywood Personalities but in a renaissance historical context as artistically much of the visuals are based. They are so focused on technical proficiency in this film namely to exploit the new technology of Technarama and with Eyvind Earle they took great advantage of the technology through intricate surroundings and atmosphere with some influence of minimalism as well.

The reason why this is not Disney's zenith is first off I could cite better character development in other films perhaps with the exception of a more compelling villain, Chernonbog's appearance in scale and might could be debatable. So really had this been greater it would have had the same effect that Snow White or other Disney classics did in the sense that it brings back interest in theatrical animation when the industry was transitioning to television. It did not such thing as many of the laid-off artists found their way to Hanna Barabera who many of the big suits at Disney ironically didn't consider them much competition, yet some of the most proficient artists in this film found their way there shortly after.

This was probably Walt's wake up call the man who was synonymous with fiscal irresponsibility with Roy keeping him in line finally conceded that Roy was right. It was a good run but following this they cease producing epics arguably until the renaissance. Overall this film has just as great use of perspective and scale and versatile use of color keys. Though visual beauty does not prevent under-developed characters. Which again the biggest pro in this film is its distinct visual style.",1305158400,,4473,4.983935742971887
880318,3,6304401132,"Out of all the Disney classics, Sleeping Beauty isn't his best work to me. It has never completely grabbed me, and I realized why I didn't want to watch it all the time when I last saw it.
To be completely honest I have never really liked the songs, and the choir. Personal choice, but that style of choir voice has never appealed to me.
However, in saying that, there are some absolutely hilarious scenes, from the fairies arguing over the dress, right till the very end, to Prince Phillip landing in the mud, to my personal favourite is the drunk Jester in court with the two kings. It is still a classic that I will treasure for all time, even if I don't watch it every week, I will certainly value it and watch it at least every six months.

880419,4,6304401132,"`Sleeping Beauty' is a classic Disney animation from before the time of CG and computer trickery and it has to be said it is even more beautiful in it's restored state. Following the fairy tale of sleeping beauty who is cursed by a witch to sleep until woken by her one true love this film has a great story for kids, some musical numbers and is interesting enough for adults to enjoy as well. The witch, Maleficent, is quite sinister at times and the parts of the film which feature her are quite dark and small children may get scared, but not excessively so. It is funny to watch this film after it was so brilliantly parodied by 'Shrek', but that doesn't detract from the charm of this film in the slightest, in fact it seems all the better for it. The extras are what we have come to expect from Disney re-releases, a making of feature, music video of the theme song, deleted scenes and various games for younger viewers. I always feel the extras have more to offer kids than adults but I guess this is essentially a children's film despite the obvious enjoyment adults will get from it as well. This is a classic Disney film and whilst it lacks the excitement or artistic skill of films such as 'Pinocchio', this should still be added to your Disney collection at some point.

880575,5,6304401132,"Fauna, one of the three Good Fairies says that tearfully to her two companions Flora and Merriwether just before the film's ending.  Me, too, love happy endings that is, this is one of the better ones, young lovers reunited for happily ever after, and good triumphing over evil!  ""Sleeping Beauty"" was the first Disney animated film I had ever seen during its original run back in 1959 when I was just about five years old.  As such I have a fondness for it, and it is one of my favorite Disney animated films!

The lavish painstaking care and attention that went into this film from Walt Disney on down is evident in this masterpiece of animated art.  Set in the 14th century, the movie looks like a medieval illuminated manuscript come to life.  The colors are vivid, dazzling vibrant and glowingly lit from within like the finest jewels, with a spectrum that embraces all the hues of a rainbow and then some.  The soaring, lyrical musical score is the most classical of all the Disney animated films, excepting ""Fantasia"", adapted by George Bruns from the ballet ""Sleeping Beauty"" composed by the master composer Peter Illich Tchaikovsky.  This is a wonderful introduction to the world of classical music for children; I remember years later when I saw Tchaikovsky's ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet performed I instantly flashed back to this movie at particular moments, chuckling to myself when I recognized Maleficent's theme in the ""Puss'n'Boots"" divertissement.

The story is so well known it almost doesn't bear repeating, it's based on the French version by Charles Perrault ""La Belle au Bois Dormant"", about the beautiful Princess Aurora who is cursed on her christening day to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday by an evil fairy who is angry she was excluded from the celebration.  This is softened by one of the good fairies attending who changes it to sleep not death, until she is awakened by the kiss of her true love.  Disney supplied his own Americanized twists and tweaks to the tale.  These include the prerequisite cute woodland creatures as friends in the forest for Briar Rose/Princess Aurora. But hey they work, and we all like them!  The most inspired touches are the Three Good Fairies, each as individual as her signature color, Flora the born leader in her coral pink, the sweetly dreamy Fauna clad in leaf green garments, and the feisty little Merriwether whose always wears a vivid blue, these are natural extensions of the Fairy Godmother in Disney's earlier ""Cinderella""; as a matter of fact Disney veteran actress Verna Felton supplies the voice for both the Fairy Godmother and Flora! The other most memorable improvement is the arch villainess, the perfectly named Maleficent, a menacing, Gothic figure in her horned headdress and flowing robes of black and purple.  Masterly voiced in curdled, disdainful tones by Eleanor Audley, she is one of the all time best in the Disney pantheon of villains.

There are two sequences that are my personal favorites.  The first is a lighthearted charming one where the Three Good Fairies use their magic to prepare for a sixteenth birthday party for Briar Rose.  Flora uses her wand to make a beautiful gown, Fauna to make a scrumptious birthday cake complete with candles, and Merriwether cleans the cottage.  Inanimate objects spring to life in a delightfully graceful ballet as scissors, needle and thread collaborate to sew the dress, the eggs crack themselves, and the flour, sugar, milk and spices measure themselves into a mixing bowl, and pour the batter into a splendidly tiered cake, while Merriwether leads the broom and mop in a happy parade across the room as they tidy up.  This is accompanied by a delicate, tinkling melody, that strengthens in tone and quickens it's leisurely pace as Flora and Merriwether engage in a comic magic duel as to what color Briar Rose's dress will be, Flora wants pink and Merriwether of course blue, and the dress keeps changing color back and forth with each flash of their wands.  The second is the escape of Prince Philip from the Maleficent's grim dungeon assisted by the Three Good Fairies.  This is a riveting, heart racing flight, as a little kid I was on the edge of my seat in anxious anticipation, wondering would he make it safely back to King Stefan's castle to awaken Princess Aurora.  The camera angles, the imaginative touches, and particularly the musical score which builds in intensity and timbre, becoming jagged, frenzied and dissonant to emphasize the danger and the terror as Prince Philip bravely fights his way to the castle, through a maze of oversized lethal looking thorns only to have to battle with Maleficent herself transformed into a huge, horrific fire-breathing dragon combine to create an unforgettable scene.  For my money, this still remains one of the most breathtaking battles between good and evil ever presented on the screen.

The vocals are all exceedingly well done; Mary Costa has a lovely radiance in both speaking and singing that make her an enchanting Briar Rose/Princess Aurora, while Bill Shirley brings an engaging youthful manliness to Prince Philip.  I've already complimented Ms. Audley earlier on her Maleficent, so let me acknowledge the three actresses that bring the Good Fairies to life:  Verna Felton as Flora, Barbara Jo Allen as Fauna and Barbara Luddy as Merriwether; all three do sterling work.  Both Misses Felton and Luddy were Disney animation film veterans, who had worked successfully for Disney before and would again afterwards.

This is chock full of extra features mostly on disc 2.  There are games for the children, a music video, an alternative opening and deleted songs (a wise choice by Disney after viewing them) and a virtual reality tour of the Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle.  What I found most worthwhile was the ""Making of Sleeping Beauty"" featurette, a short subject on the composer Tchaikovsky and the commentary by Pixar animator and director John Lasseter, film critic and historian Leonard Maltin and Disney animator Andreas Dejas.  Their discussion and comments over the film were very interesting, and I especially liked Lasseter's briefly becoming a little boy again in his excitement over the battle between Prince Philip and Maleficent.  The one flaw is the many trailers and previews that are included, there must be close to 10 at least, very obnoxious, since you can't just access the menu to start the movie but have to keep skipping to the next one.  This is a very poor way to present a classic, & I don't think Walt Disney would have stood for it!",1288137600,,6635,4.943294329432943

880671,2,6304401132,"This is easily the worst disc we have ever watched.  Not because of the movie itself, which is a faithful - even gorgeous - transfer.  But in the battle to get to see it.

First off, this disc includes TEN ads in the beginning!  Fortunately, depending your player you can chapter skip, and so I did.  Over, and over, and over. And then the screen went black, and I had to do it all again.  It took almost 5 minutes just to GET to the movie!

Second, and perhaps worse, is the disc doesn't play for 2-3 minutes even when you DO get to the movie!  This isn't a mistake, it actually warns you of this as the disc starts.  And true to it's word, it just goes black for so long you think it's broken.  If you get to the point of the disc playing, you literally have time to go make yourself a snack!

Combined, these 'features' are so infuriating that they cast a dark pall over the entire movie that never really went away.  The best word to describe it is 'abusive.'  I think Walt would roll in his grave if he knew how miserable an experience Disney has wrapped around and in front of his classic.",1281484800,5,1095,4.1571428571428575

880675,5,6304401132,"Si has actualizado tu equipo a blu-ray, esta pelcula clsica no puede faltar en tu coleccin.
Vi esta pelcula siendo muy chico y la verdad nunca me imagin que me enamorara de ella casi 30 aos despus de haberla descubierto en VHS.

Como creo que hay otras reseas que hablarn de lo grandioso de la historia y su relevancia nostlgica, no hablar mucho de eso. Yo les hablar un poco de las aportacions tcnicas que tiene esta edicin en blu-ray.

Si de verdad quieres saber de que es capaz en calidad de imagen tu blu-ray, tienes que tener este filme. Las ilustraciones , el detalle en los fondos y el estilo visual creado por Eyvind Earle no tienen comparacin. Y se aprecia el minucioso trabajo artesanal de los artistas de Disney, esta calidad pone en evidencia, para nuestro deleite visual-y auditivo- las razones por las que La Bella durmiente perdi dinero en un principio, pero tienen que verla en alta definicin para entender a que me refiero.  Una produccion que comenz en 1951 y termin hasta 1958..  7 aos de produccin!.

IMAGEN
Para esta produccin  Disney utiliz un formato muy especil: Negativo Technirama de 35mm de doble cuadro,impreso en Technirama de 70mm, creando un ""aspect ratio"" de 2.55:1 .  Es decir, 2 veces lo largo de una peli normal . Los dibujantes tuvieron que adaptarse y trabajar con ilustracines que abarcaban practicamente todo el restirador. Una de las gracias del Blu-ray es que tiene un detrs de cmaras realizada en los 50's para el show de ""El mundo de Disney"" en donde vemos gran parte del proceso de produccin de La Bella Durmiente.

AUDIO
Adems el audio fu remezclado para hacer provecho de la tecnologa 7.1. , y haciendo provecho de esto escuchamos lo mismo que el principe Felipe escucha cuando es atraido por el canto hetereo de Aurora en la secuencia del bosque, y las llamas de dragon nos envuelven en  una de las secuencias de accin ms emocionantes en la historia del cine. Que cosa mas maravillosa. La desventaja es que para esta edicin, las voces en espaol aunque verdaderamente geniales,no son las originales. Me imagino que esto se debe a la nueva mezcla de audio que en espaol est en 5.1-Dios nos libre de que hagan lo mismo con El libro de la Selva.

ESPECIALES.
Esta edicion especial platino de 50 aniversario viene cargado de especiales.
La edicion contien dos blu-rays.

El primero trae la pelcula, las opciones de audio en Ingles, Espaol, Portugues (5.1) e Ingles y Frances (7.1).. que yo no se porque le siguen dando mas importancia al frances si hay mas gente que habla espaol, en fin.
Unos jueguillos ahi medio chafones y un cortito digital -El Encuentro con El Dragon-que hace uso de la tecnologia 7.1.
El Especial que de verdad vale la pena de este disco es un audiocomentario con John Lasseter que tambin va mostrando recuadros con imgenes en relevancia a lo que se est comentando.

El segundo disco tiene la caracterstica que contiene los especiales en Alta Definicin. Cosa que hoy en da no es muy comn para una pelcula clsica.
Entre los destacable est la reconstruccin virtual de el paseo original de el castillo de la Bella durmiente en Disneylandia, paseo que dur muy poco tiempo en el famoso parque debido a las aconglomeraciones que provocaba.. pero todo eso viene explicado en el disco.
Tambion contiene escenas y canciones eliminadas _en su versin de storyboard, claro_. Una mirada a los artistas y sus estilos en ""Cuatro artistas pintan un rbol"" , entre otros.

CONCLUSION.

Este Blu-Ray vale la pena como ningn otro. Calidad en imgen y sonido insuperables, Especiales como para aventar para arriba, y entretenimiento divertido, musical, romntico, emocionante, sano y familiar. Una compra segura, un clsico inmortal.",1274659200,2,3674,4.80190174326466
880676,5,6304401132,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The Walt Disney Company's 1959 adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is the last truly great animated film from the studio's early brilliance.  It caps the first era of feature-length animation which began with Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" in style, with a simple story told through daring animation and creativity.

With the voice talents of Mary Costa, Eleanor Audley, and Verna Felton, among many others, the movie's dynamic animation precedes the digital revolution in animation by at least three decades.  Yet, the available resources of the time are utilized so ingeniously that the movie is literally forty years ahead of its time.  It also boasts unique characters and a script which is not afraid to present its villainess as a purely evil demonic witch.

The storyline is deceptively simple:  three benevolent fairies look after a princess, deep undercover because of a vengeful death curse at her christening.  Eleanor Audley's vocal work combined with frighteningly mature animation make the evil fairy Maleficent one of Disney's most potentially terrifying antagonists.  Her name itself is a stroke of genius:  a combination of the words ""malevolent"" and ""magnificent.""

Also featuring a great soundtrack comprised mostly of Tchaikovsky's ""Sleeping Beauty Ballet,"" and including the poetic ""Once Upon A Dream,"" Walt Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a superb film, animated or otherwise.",1274140800,,1421,5.472477064220183

880678,4,6304401132,"This movie came out the year after I was born, but if I remember correctly, the last time I saw it was in the movie theatres when I was a child.  Although it's great family fare, it's not as good as other Disney classic animated films.  Along with the blu-ray disc I also received a regular DVD version in a cardboard slip case.  It would have been nice if the plastic case held all three DVDs inside.  Now, I have to be concerned with losing the DVD that is just held on the front cover of the plastic case with a bit of glue.  The second blu-ray disc that comes with the movie has some fun games to play.  In fact, to me that was the best part of this package.  One of the games where you have to follow along with the forest animal's dance steps is not easy.  The one where the wicked queen tries to read your mind is indeed a mind blower.  It definitely figured out what I was thinking.  Probably the only difficulty I had with the games was with my remote.  A child would definitely have to be told how to get from one place to the next using the blu-ray disc player remote.",1271894400,,1079,4.09047619047619

Sadly, it just isn't all that I remembered it to be--we (the hubby, my 2 year-old and my 5 year-old) almost fell asleep on this movie. It is slow-paced and uninteresting. The music is lame; the premise is lame. The fairies are still as fun as I remembered, but not good enough to carry an entire movie. Lest you think I am too picky, I do want to say that we all enjoyed Snow White, & Cinderella  and both of these movies were made before my mother was born (I am 35 years-old). It is NOT that this movie is old--it's just boring.",1271548800,,611,4.091666666666667

880870,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty was my all time favorite Disney film. I was so in love with this story, it's crazy how many times I wore out the VHS. But growing up, I lost touch with the story, but I recently bought the Blu-Ray and re-watched the film and you know what? I'm still in love with this movie. I really miss these old Disney movies where the animation was so bright and beautiful, the characters were so lovable, and the story was so magical. I'm not bashing Disney films from today, just I'm sure we could all relate on this subject where the older Disney films just had a certain charm about it. Sleeping Beauty is just a timeless story and has so much wonderful romance, I guess since I'm a girl, I just couldn't help but still be in love with this beautiful story.

Princess Aurora is born and is the future queen of her land, three fairy's, Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna bless her with three gifts: beauty and song, right as Merryweather is about to bless Aurora, the evil witch, Maleficent, comes in and curses Aurora that she shall touch a spinning wheel by her 16th birthday and die! Merryweather changes it to where she won't die, but sleep and could only be woke up by the kiss of true love. The fairy's wish to keep this from happening still, so they take Aurora and raise her as their own. One day Aurora on her 16th birthday goes out in the forest and meets the charming and handsome Prince Phillipe, but she doesn't know he's a prince and she doesn't know he's fhe man she's actually betrothed too. She is told by the fairy's that she can never see him again and that she's a princess; later that night the curse happens! Now the fairy's need Phillipe to save Aurora before it's too late.

Everything about Sleeping Beauty is just a perfect Disney film and I can't wait until to show this to my future kids one day. I know that their generation is going to have just the CGI animation, so it's good that at least we still have these films, they're treasures. The voices, the animation, the story, Sleeping Beauty is the most romantic fairy tale that anyone could easily fall in love with. If you are a Disney fan, this is a must see, it's a great family film or if you're just a film buff in general, I'm a grown up and I still tear up when I watch Sleeping Beauty.",1270166400,,2277,4.342723004694836

If you own the Special Edition version of this that was released a few years back, it's not quite amazing enough to upgrade to this.
However, if you do not own digital non VHS verison of this movie, this is the copy you should purchase!

881012,5,6304401132,"I first watched Sleeping Beauty years ago in Day Care.  And of course, I must have watched it time and time again with my sister and my cousins.  This Disney movie is based on the classic Brothers Grimm tale, about a princess named Aurora, who under the spell of a wicked witch will ""prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die.""  Fortunately, one of her fairy godmothers revoked the spell, by saying that yes she would prick her finger, but rather than die, she would sleep for one-hundred years without aging one second.  And that she would awake to love's first kiss.  Like Aurora, I have always dreamed of finding true love, and living Happily Ever After.  This is such a wonderful movie.  The scene when Flora, Fauna and Merryweather put the kingdom to sleep before Aurora wakes up, makes me cry every time I watch it.  Make sure to add this first-rate film to your collection, before it goes in the Disney Vault!",1261958400,,919,4.527272727272727

The Blu-ray also has the option of leaving messages to loved ones or communicating while watching the movie with a family member who is also watching it. I haven't used this feature but I can only assume it would be exciting. I love the extra features this has. The whole story behind how they built the Sleeping Beauty attraction in Disneyland Resort was Awesome!

You can't beat having two of a good thing. I love this movie and I know not everyone has Blu-ray, yet, so having a DVD copy helps. I can lend this movie out to friends while still having my Blu-ray copy on me.

881108,5,6304401132,"Disney was passionate about the restoration of this movie. The visuals and details of the picture are simply BREATHTAKING in Blu Ray on a good projection screen.
But the audio is simply astounding. Disney wanted the best audio possible for this film, and it was recorded in Germany (the vocals were done in the US)
The original recordings of the orchestration still exist, remarkably,and were incorporated with a 'cleaned up' voice and effect track.
The result puts almost all modern day soundtracks to shame. The Master Audio soundtrack is rich, sonorous, noiseless, and VERY high fidelity... and in 'living stereo'
On a good set of electrostatic loudspeakers (my reference monitors) the audio has to be heard to be believed...

881109,5,6304401132,"I know it's not saying a lot, but this movie is better than 99% of the movies that come out nowadays.  It really is a timeless classic. Everything is just as Walt intended, unlike many of the disney movies in recent years that I think have lost their way and entirely miss the sense of what he was trying to accomplish.  Many of Disney's recent classics are not really Timeless. For example, I recently watched Alladin and was astonished by the number of 90's pop culture references in the film.  While hilarious, they probably won't hold up to the test of time and future audiences may be confused.
Another example:
Disney's upcoming film about the frog princess looks like it will no doubt be an atrocity. Aside from there being what looks like an inter-racial couple, (which would make Walt Disney roll over in his grave), the movie just looks incredibly stupid and full of stereotypes and poop humor. I think it's great that they are trying to incorporate African-Americans into their movies finally, but does that mean that the movie automatically takes place in some poor ghetto slum and all the characters have to speak ebonics? Apparently it does, and the movie looks to be one massive stereotype.",1259625600,,1205,4.755980861244019

It's has the most attractive animation even to this day. I own the VHS, Laserdisc, DVD and now the Bluray. But the BluRay is the best format that I've seen so far.

When I was nine, I saw a comic book retelling of the Walt Disney movie, but I finally saw this movie the first time.  (Actually, I thought the comic made a couple of improvements, including the ending.)

One can argue if this is really one of Walt Disney's classics:  I would not put it in that category.  I did have some problems with the drinking scene where the minstrel got drunk -- I think that is trivializing alcohol for a young audience.  There are logical problems to the story such as how three fairies who cannot cook or sew without using magic can care for a girl for sixteen years without using magic.  But this is still quality entertainment for the children.  The climax is very suspenseful.

881243,5,6304401132,"Should I need to explain how important Sleeping Beauty is as an animated film, or what it's about? Probably not. Sadly, the movie gets passed over in favor of its more appealing Disney brethren, and few of today's generation (especially males) have seen it. Heard of it? Sure. It's a classic, after all. With this latest DVD release, Disney is hoping to provide the children, teens, and adults of today with another reminder of one of its most forgotten-but most memorable-classics.

First hitting theaters in 1959 after nearly a decade of work during the last ten years of Walt Disney's life, Sleeping Beauty was a different looking animated movie, and the first animated feature to be completed in a super-wide scope for theaters. I bet you didn't know Sleeping Beauty was the first movie to be both presented in Technirama widescreen format and shot in 70mm. (A fact which comes across splendidly in this new remastering.)

While the technology behind it may have been breaking ground, the story of Sleeping Beauty ultimately is just more of the ""same ol' Disney!"" thing. Taking one part Grimm's fairy tale, and one part Disney rewrite, Sleeping Beauty, as you likely know, revolves around a princess named Aurora, who is cursed at her christening by the evil witch Maleficent to die before she turns 16. Rather than let the young girl grow up to die, three fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather raise the girl under the alias Briar Rose in the woods.

I bet you could guess what happens next even if you've never seen it. Basically, Aurora is discovered by a charming prince with a white steed, and the evil pet bird of Maleficent. Evil spell, sleep, wake up with a kiss, fight a dragon-you know the rest.

The movie is a classic, you get that. What really makes this Platinum re-release of the DVD shine (remember it was released briefly in 2003 in a then-Special Edition) is the brilliant restoration and upgrade job they did with the art. When the 2003 version came out, I was amazed they were releasing Sleepin gBEauty in a 2.55:1 image; this release goes beyond that. Even if you've seen Sleeping Beauty dozens of times, this is like watching the movie anew. You'll see new things on the edges of the screen which add to scenes, and you'll see more detail of the brillian tartowkr. In short, they took an archaic release, upgraded it once, then kicked it up a notch and did it again.

The color palettes were also edited for better clarity and crispness. Overall, I like the changes and modernizing of the colors with the digital enhancement. There are some instances where the new changes don't even remotely resemble the original (such as when Aurora sees the green flames of the spinning wheel). In the newly colored scene, there's really no green ambient lighting at all until she's up against the fire. It's one of the few questionable changes, but overall the re-coloring is splendid and combined with the wider image, it's a visual treat.

Not only is the video improved, but the audio is as well. 5.1 sound, better upgraded clarity, and to top it all off original theatrical audio for those who refuse to watch classic releases tampered with.

If the better audio and video weren't enough, the extras trump what we got in the 2003 edition. Commentary tracks, historical documentaries on several of the minds behind individual aspects of the art/story, an alternate storyboard opening, deleted songs, a virtual tour of Sleeping Beauty's castle, and a 45 minute Making Of featurette highlight the brand new additions to the DVD. Along with those new additions, the Platinum Edition also features the best leftovers from the Special Edition, including storyboard sequences, live-action references, art galleries, trailer galleries, and a feature on four Disney artists crafting a tree.

Unlike many Disney re-re-releases, Sleeping Beauty: Platinum Edition is a grand slam. With an upgraded video transfer, much improved audio tracks, and a plethora of new and classic features, this is by far the best version of Sleeping Beauty ever released. Whether you picked up the 2003 edition or not, if you're a fan of Disney's classic movies, this is a must-buy. If you're on the fence, pick it up and hold on to it, because once it goes out of print and ""re-enters the Vault"" who knows how long it will be until you get a second chance.",1249689600,3,4350,4.837365591397849

881337,5,6304401132,"One definitely has the feeling that the Disney producers of this 50th Anniversary DVD release were more than a little strapped for materiel to pad out the movie - which is as short as it is gorgeously visualized, and set to Tchaikovsky's lilting ballet music. It is the ultimate dance move; it seems as if every character, not just the two lovers are dancing, most of the time. The video itself looks quite lovely, clean and crisp, and I am sure the enhanced `surround sound"" would have rattled the rafters, if I had the home theater sound system... er... and any rafters to rattle. Even at the length of barely over an hour, the movie enchanted the public almost as much as its creators --Walt Disney himself not the least. The castle in whose highest tower the lovely Aurora slept, waiting for true love's first kiss was being built for real even as ""Sleeping Beauty"" was in production, to eventually become the landmark and logo for Disney's real-world amusement park properties.

One of the extra features is a walk through of an original feature of the castle, in which park visitors peeped through keyholes, windows and doors at various scenes. This feature is long-closed, but was re-created electronically, using some of the still-extant features, which seem to have been just left in the closed up storage spaces within the Castle. There is a very long feature about the ""Making of"" in which a shout-out is given to just about everyone (living and dead) who had anything to do with the creation of the feature. We half-expected inclusion of the janitors who swept up and emptied out the trash baskets, since this kind of animation must have meant tons of it. There is also the usual collection of discarded story-boarded but never animated scenes, an alternate opening... and the Disney short about Grand Canyon, set to Ferdy Grofe's music. Not sure what that was doing there, maybe for the classical music element.",1243728000,,1924,4.812688821752266

881343,5,6304401132,"In common with most of my fellow ""late boomers"" who were born in the late 1950s, I have fond memories of the Disney films of that era.  ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" were the two animated Disney productions which were first released in our early childhoods.  I am  extraordinarily fond of ""Dalmatians"", and while I am less enamored of ""Sleeping Beauty"", I still find in it much to enjoy.  The newly restored version available in the Platinum Edition is magnificently colored and beautifully restored.  Gems flash, silks shine, and the textures of wood and stone are wonderfully real.  Tchaikovsky's music never sounded better.  Emotions run at a high level throughout the film and culminate in the exciting battle between Prince Philip and Maleficient.  As I watched the Platinum Edition for the first time I realized with some surprise that many of my early mental images of Middle earth, as I read J.R.R. Tolkien's books in the late 1960s and early 1970s, were subconsciously influenced by my exposure to ""Sleeping Beauty!""

""Sleeping Beauty"" is very much a product of its time.  Aurora/Briar Rose has the same preoccupation every young woman fifty years ago was supposed to have: find the perfect Prince who will carry her away. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, (most girls knew better then and now, of course) but it does make for an interesting contrast with ""Dalmatians,"" which though released just a couple of years later has many more female characters with much more developed personalities.

I'll rewatch and enjoy ""Sleeping Beauty"" many times.  The additional material, including information on the elaborate production process, is interesting, too.  But what I'll find most intriguing will be the contrast between  prevailing assumptions in the mid-twentieth and the early twenty-first centuries.",1238976000,,1845,5.2312925170068025

The colors pop out and the attention to detail is very impressive. It is like Pixar but 50 years ago. No wonder why this movie took 6 year to make. The scenes of the forest and the witch's castle are amazing. I watched the whole movie and was consistently impressed in this area.

The BD has a 7.1 DTS-HD Surround sound which obviously is far better from the original movie. However, I believe Disney dropped the ball in the sound area. The surround from the back speakers is overcharged, in fact there are scenes where it shadows the front speakers. Also the main central front speaker sounds awful and they could have enhanced this. I understand that they included the original lossless audio, yet still they could have enhanced this in order to appeal a new generation. he same way they did with the graphics.

Overall the movie is very good; however like in the middle it becomes a little bit draggy even for my three year old daughter, who is a Disney fan. There are some scenes when she  becomes a little bit bored, which rarely happens to her when she is watching Disney or Pixar movies.

I recommend this BD ONLY if you have kids that will enjoy the movie, you are Disney Collector, or you have seen this movie earlier in your life. Otherwise, I believe you WOULD NOT enjoy this purchase. The reason is because some scenes are lenghty, and the audio problems I mentioned before.

I personally like this film and believe is a good addition to our collection.

Personally, there are only a handful of real Disney treasures. And their color, attention to detail, and depth is beyond perfect. In the world of mass production, Disney's creations today has become a flat and somewhat monotonistic in color and depth.

I've been looking forward to this most recent release of Sleeping Beauty for a long time - my VHS tape was wearing out, and when my young son discovered the film, it was getting significantly higher playing time.  It is, in my opinion, the best of the classic Disneys (herein defined as those that Walt personally supervised).  Thus, it was was with great relish that I made this my first-ever Blu-ray purchase.

The film itself is as good as ever, obviously.  The sound has been cleaned up some, but is still not fantastic.  That's okay, because there's something charming about the thin-ness of these old films.  The video looks better than ever.  The extras are numerous and range from ho-hum to fascinating.  The audio commentary by Pixar guru John Lassiter, film critic Leonard Maltin, and others is informative but unspectacular - it tends to cheerleading at times.  There is a Wonderful World of Disney fictionalised account of Tchaikovsky's life, most interesting as a period example of what was being shown on the WWD TV show.

In fact, Disney really dug around in its vault for this disc!  Also included is a short film on the Grand Canyon (apparently the preview short shown in the theatrical run) and another WWD episode on the making of the film.  The best extra, though, is a short film (15 minutes) on four Disney animators playing artist for the day.  They all take the same subject (a particular tree) and make a ""picture"" of it.  The four pictures are as diverse as the personalities of the artists, and makes for an interesting case study, as well as showing art in progress.  There are also a number of original songs that were written before the decision was made to blend in the Tchaikovsky ballet score, so they sound more like traditional Disney pop songs.

So why the 3-star rating?  Well, this Blu-ray disc was so incredibly annoying that I wish I'd bought the DVD instead.  The menus are not easily navigated and worst of all, if you stop the playback, there is no memory, it simply re-starts from the very beginning (including the FBI copyright warning and the ads - and WHY MUST I WATCH ADS WHEN I'VE PAID GOOD MONEY FOR A DISC! ARGH!).  This is not a problem with my Blu-ray player (a PS3-80GB) as all the other DVDs and Blu-rays I've tried retain memory of location and will not restart cold, even when ejected from the machine.

My recommendation: buy the DVD instead.  You don't get the same number of extras, but there are lots on the Platinum edition, including the commentary and the alternate songs.",1231113600,2,2548,4.665919282511211

I could rest easy knowing that I had the blu ray edition, but I could watch the DVD copy until I got my player.

881819,1,6304401132,"Like many people in Latin America, I grew up watching some great Disney movies. I believe that what really made them such hits with Spanish-speaking audiences (back then) were the great dubs (doblajes) of the time.
I was really excited when Disney started advertising this new special anniversary edition, restored and full of goodies. However, disappointment struck when watching the movie I realized that they had decided to re-dub the whole movie.

Now, one of the reasons this movie was brought back is to show off the potential of a fully animated Disney classic on Blue-ray. Nevertheless, if Disney wanted to advertise tha package as fully restored, they also had to do the so for all non-English tracks (French and Spanish). However, the classic dubs would cost too much money to be restored. Thus, Disney decided to ditch the old and bring in the new. So they just re-recoded everything in 5.1 DEHT and started advertising it as such.

Maybe Disney doesn't understand this, but the old dubs have become inseparable parts of their movies. To me, this is not the same movie that I grew up with and came to love. And hence, the bad grade.

If you don't mind the cheap voice-overs that come in 5,1 DEHT, then this DVD is for you. But if you appreciate good acting, good translations, or just simply want to relieve a really good movie and share it with a new generation of youngsters, then, by all means skip this one.",1228262400,19,1422,4.7028112449799195

881898,5,6304401132,"Disney's classic fairy tale SLEEPING BEAUTY is timeless.  It is as lovely today as it was in 1959.  Full of warmth, saturated colors, and an enduring story, SLEEPING BEUATY continues to enchant princesses of all ages.

We purchased this DVD for my three year old as a Christmas gift, but could not resist a sneak peak at Grandma and PawPaw's house over Thanksgiving.  The animation was stellar in 1959, and I must say, it certainly holds its own against any animation of today.  The vibrancy, detail, and charm still capture the imagination, submerging the viewer the fairy tale world.  The story itself is eternal:  good triumphs over evil and love, true love, concurs all.  The music is a perfect accompaniment to the tale, and ""Once Upon A Dream"" ranks up there as one of the all time best Disney songs.

I very much enjoyed watching this with my two girls and the rest of my family.  It was a beautiful way for the entire family to spend a small part of Thanksgiving week doing something memorable together.  I was surprised about how much of this movie I did not remember from when I saw it 40 years ago, and I was surprised how much detail my 11 year old remembered from the first time she saw it.  The three year old was simply enchanted by the entire movie; from the fairies to Princess Aurora.  She was enraptured the magic and the majesty of the story.

I highly recommend this dvd as a treat for the entire family.  Little ones, teens, parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles will all have a wonderful time together.

The fight with the dragon is gorgeous. I haven't had a chance to go through all the extras or the bd-live yet, but I hope to in the near future.

882054,5,6304401132,"I'm one of the many who faithfully turn out every time Disney release a new DVD of one of their classic animated films. The Platinum series, bi-annual releases of the Disney films which sold best on VHS, has proved an exemplary program, and the impressive streak continues with this edition of Sleeping Beauty.

First, the movie; Sleeping Beauty was one of the last Disney movies I'd not managed to see in my childhood. It never came across my radar, so I was very excited to see it. The story is classic Disney, and well-executed classic Disney at that. The characters are all well-developed, and the voice acting is extremely good. But it's the visuals that sell it. This is the most beautiful piece of eye candy in the entire Disney library. I couldn't stop looking at the animation, with vibrant colours filling every inch of frame. This was the last Disney movie before they started using a photocopying process, and while I love the look of the next group of films (101 Dalmations and The Jungle Book, for example), there's nothing that can compare with the beauty of hand-painted cells. It's gorgeous from start to finish.

As for the bonus features, I've loved the Platinum Series as much for the documentaries as I have for the movies. Each one in the line has come with a tremendous thirty- to sixty-minute feature on the making of the film, and this one is an interesting and informative watch.

I didn't buy the previous release of Sleeping Beauty, so I can't say how the transfer or the bonus features compare to that, but if you haven't already added this movie to your collection, there's no reason to hesitate. It's a classic for a reason, and well worth your time.",1226793600,,1681,4.672297297297297

Our old VHS tape broke ages ago, and we've been unable to buy a new copy on DVD until now.  In typical Disney style, this movie will be available only for a limited time and then gone again for several years.  If you even think your family might want this movie eventually over the next 10 years, buy it now.

Using the same long-term perspective, I almost bought the Blue-Ray version.  However, we don't have a Blue-Ray player yet, and my daughter got this movie as a birthday present to watch now - not eventually.

Movie Review:  Among Disney animation movies, Sleeping Beauty is generally acknowledged as having the most dark and sinister of villians.  The evil witch actually become a black fire-breathing dragon for the major fight scene.  Otherwise the film is as much about the prince as the princess, with plenty of comic relief scenes thrown in from their royal fathers and the three good faries.

882157,3,6304401132,"""Sleeping Beauty"" isn't a very warm or emotionally engaging film, and those of us who love it do so because of its extraordinary design artistry (largely due to the participation of artist Eyvind Earle). The film's use of color is central to its artistic integrity, but those who have digitally remastered ""Sleeping Beauty"" for this Blu-Ray edition have played havoc with its original palette. Scores of Disney artists labored for years to put ""Sleeping Beauty"" on the screen, but a few keyboard-pounding technicians with no obvious artistic credentials have marred its color scheme and spoiled one of its key charms. If all you want is the visual sweep, the sharp clarity, and (heaven help you) the story of ""Sleeping Beauty,"" then this version will serve; if you want the carefully chosen colors that bathed the screen in its original Super Technirama 70/Technicolor release, then you'll be sadly disappointed.",1226448000,8,912,5.168918918918919

882160,5,6304401132,"This is the movie that started me off on a lifetime passion for fantasy tales.  I was in third grade when Disney released this film.  Our school had a good citizenship program where once a month we would be allowed to go with some teachers to the local theater for a matinee.  Usually, they were old black and whites starring talking mules and Our Gang cartoons.  The matinees never quite held the same thrill as that day we were treated to a tale of magical kingdoms with fairies and witches where good conquered evil.  I was instantly hooked and spent hours in the library searching for volumes of fairy tale books.  When my daughter was born, I began collecting Disney videos and now I am starting a new collection of DVDs for my granddaughter.  I hope that she will find them as exciting as I did.  It is much harder to instill that magical experience now when the market is flooded with cheap imitations starring Barbie and smart mouthed zebras.

882250,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is a landmark film in Disney history. Beyond its bold, distinctive look, which has already received due praise and discussion, it came along when Walt Disney Productions had fully transformed from primarily a movie-making studio to a multi-faceted company with its own theme park, publishing, record labels and other interests that interwove each other in a process Roy Disney called ""cross-pollination"" but today we call synergy.

During its six-year production period leading to its much-heralded release in 1959, Sleeping Beauty inspired the castle in Disneyland (and the walk-through attraction which is now being reopened and featured on this new DVD), fourteen different recording releases (one featuring Broadway star Mary Martin and another with Mouseketeer Darlene Gillespie), countless comics, coloring books, toys and other merchandise, and perhaps most significantly, promoted on television from Walt's very first Disneyland show in 1954 to the Mickey Mouse Club.

While these elements existed for Disney in one form or another before Sleeping Beauty, never before had they been so homegrown.

You can see many of these elements on the not-to-be-missed new 50th anniversary ""Platinum Edition"" DVD, overflowing with bonus features including a new audio commentary with Leonard Maltin, John Lasseter and Andreas Deja, several new mini-documentaries (with some Pixar artists as well as Disney personalities in attendance) and, as mentioned above, a Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Walk-Through Attraction With Walt Disney Imagineering that you can customize and experience before it opens to the public.

Through years of work in writing his two ""Disney's Lost Chords"" books about the songs that did not make it into Disney films, artist/historian Russell Schroeder had a hand in making possible the ""lost"" sequences new to the DVD, including an alternate opening with a song called ""Holiday"" and three other song demos with storyboards to convey what might have been.",1225843200,,1988,5.59468438538206

I don't have a Blu-Ray player &/or recorder yet as I awaiting Panasonic making an ungradeable version recorder and lower prices. My review, thus, really covers the packaging. The first problem is the slip on sleeve over the plastic box. The box was shrink wrapped but the slip on sleeve was not. Sure this leads to destructiuon of this sleeve in the retail stores. The DVD version is in a light same size cardboard attached to the Blu-Ray plastic box with four(4) pieces of sticky roll-on glue leaving sticky marks when trying to roll off. This glue also caused print to come off with the glue and the same is true of the clear sticker stopping the disc slipping out in the delivery. I like the plastic box externally but internally the two lugs are two loose and when I opened the package Disc 2 fell out on the floor and was damaged with scratches and dust(that, at least, is blown off). Disc 1 was behind three inserts, loose, but did not fall out. Looking at the ad on the DVD version and it tells me that Blu-Ray is made from scratch resistant materials. Not currently my view or experience at this time. One has to to see that Blu-Ray has more material in a given area than DVD thus if scratches effect the playback then a much larger area is or can be damaged. I have never used or seen the DVD version of scratch resistant material. Worth a thought before too much further time goes on with Blu-Ray. Maybe this is an isolated incident but the lugs are definitely to flush and loose to hold the discs firmly in place, especially for travel long maiul delivery distances",1225065600,3,1904,5.06687898089172
882470,5,6304401132,"OK, I always thought Sleeping Beauty was one of Disney's least exciting offerings from their classic animation films. Although I saw in the theaters when I was very young, I mostly know it from the VHS version. But my wife said it was her favorite so when it came out on Blu Ray, I picked it up.

Just a few points on why it is so impressive. First, the BR version displays the full original aspect ratio, you get to see the film in full Cinemascope. Second, the transfer to BR looks flawless, you'll see details in the animation you didn't know where there. I kept staring at it in awe. Finally, the sound quality was full and clean.

So put that all together and it actually makes the semi-flat characters come alive and the kinda lame plot seem exciting. Overall, BR gave me a new appreciation for Sleeping Beauty, and I can't wait for future Disney BR releases. (Beauty and the Beast next, please?)

Oh, and how awesome is it that they threw in the DVD version too?",1224633600,2,969,4.402234636871508
882471,4,6304401132,"What?  Disney's released another two-disc edition of ""Sleeping Beauty?""  Why, pray tell?  Because they can?  Because poor Disney-addicted saps like myself will fall for the ruse and pony up more of our hard-earned cash, even though we already own the Special Edition that was released a mere five years ago?  You can tell I was skeptical.  But there are some wonderful new extras on this release that weren't included in the last, and for hardcore fans, they're definitely worth having.  And the film itself...?  Well, for those of you who have never seen ""Sleeping Beauty,"" by all means snatch it up.  This may not be Disney's most entertaining film in terms of story line, but it's certainly one of its most visually gorgeous.  The look of the film is based on ancient tapestries and medieval artwork, and the way that the studio's animators and background artists have translated them to the screen (led by the brilliant, visionary Eyvind Earle), is nothing less than breathtaking.

The biggest drawback to any edition of ""Sleeping Beauty,"" and it's not necessarily a small one, is that the scope of the film, its visual, widescreen beauty and impact will be completely lost on a conventionally sized television.  If you don't have a big screen TV, it's almost not worth the investment.

So, if you have the old edition of the film, try selling it on Amazon and put the money towards getting the new one.  If you don't have either, just be aware that the size of your set may seriously effect (or enhance) your enjoyment of this most beautiful and unique of Disney's masterpieces.",1224633600,,1583,4.814814814814815

The colors are gorgeous, love the widescreen presentation, but I have an issue.  I have a 40"" flat screen LCD HD television (but a non-HD DVD player) and when I play this DVD I notice a lot of blurring of the crisp edges, particularily when the characters are in motion. It's especially noticable in the opening sequence (""Hail to the Princess Aurora""), and when Kings Stefan and Hubert are toasting the impending marriage of Aurora and Phillip (""Skumps""). Those are the worst instances I've noticed so far, but it's all through the film. When the fairies wave their wands or move too quickly the wands and the outlines of their clothing have a zig-zag appearance instead of crisp edges. Even when chracters turn their heads sometimes it's noticable. Something makes me think it's not a defect with the disc itself. I'm not sure if this is just because TV technology has progressed so far beyond the original animation, or maybe my standard DVD player isn't up to snuff. Or maybe it's an issue with the restoration.

882475,5,6304401132,"What is so exquisite about Sleeping Beauty is that it looks like a medieval tapestry coming to life. If you look closely at the details in the backgrounds you can see little twists in the leaves and curves in the tree bark which overall gives an ornate and opulent look still refreshing to this day. It was the most expensive film in it's day, it took over four years to make and Walt Disney stated to his artists and animators that they should take their time over it, make it beautiful and so it came as a shock when it didn't do all that well in the cinemas. It wasn't really able to communicate to an american youth who were smoking things they shouldn't and it seemed this highly romantic film was too idealistic in it's portrayal of young love, it felt as if it should have been released earlier than the late 1950's, so culturally you can see that it wasn't able to make audiences identify with it. But this is probably the one Disney film which stands the test of time better than any other, artistically speaking; since the music is exemplary and the imagery and animation highly captivating, more so than anything Disney has attempted in recent years. In places it is so beautiful to watch.

The Disney studios today have developed the way they tell fairy tales now to another stunning level as 2010 will mark a new leap in visual storytelling for the company with the release of Rapunzel Unbraided, a computer animated film which has the feel and sensitivity of a traditional animated 2d film yet with the texture of an oil painting coming to life. For years now the company has been trying to reinvent their style, pushing their visual language to another stratosphere and they may well have done it in Rapunzel, but from what I have viewed it does echo slightly the romantic style of Sleeping Beauty, it's attention to detail is just as shimmering and splendid ... we'll have to see. We can see though that this film, Sleeping Beauty, set a standard which modern animators and film makers still aim for and that is why Sleeping Beauty is such an enduring work of art, as it really aimed to make animation a cinematic art form, it was ahead of it's time and held a maturity wiser than it's time.",1224115200,,2207,4.5175

The picture is amazing, and the enhanced audio is a extremely nice touch. The special features are ROCKING, especially for any young kids, you young at heart! I think they did well with this, and it makes for a nice add on to your Disney movie collection. I think for the price Amazon offers it doesn't make for an expensive re-buy either, if you go to any other store, the price is above $18, and I payed under that with shipping. I am not completely happy with how Disney re-invents it's already pre-released classics and films, but for what they add on, how they make the picture better and better, and everything else they end up adding on or offering, it is worth it.

No other animated film has utilized the talents of the best dancers, costume markers, musicians, animators, painters, designers, and singers to bring about such a harmonious clear vision as in ""Sleeping Beauty.""  Artistically it is one of the most beautiful films you will ever watch.

The Blu-ray and/or the DVD of the restored version are well worth purchasing even if you already own an older version of the film.  Comparing it to the special edition DVD, the film grain has been eliminated which gives the characters a nice clean flat look.

The colors  are a lot brighter, brighter than they've ever been before.  However, I'm not 100% convinced that it enhances every scene.  Most of the scenes look wonderful with these bright vivid colors, but there's a few scenes which I feel might have looked better, having a more sophisticated color composition with those subdued tones you get from watching the Special edition.  But the thing is, I don't know how true these enhanced bright colors are to the original color compositions intended by the artists so I suppose it all boils down to a matter of taste.  Thanks to the Blu-ray you can see in the backgrounds a much higher level of detail and depth of color which is quiet striking.

No matter what version of the film you get your hands on, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a must watch and this new restoration has done a wonderful job of eliminating film grain, brightening up colors, and the fact that aspect ratio allows even more of the artwork to be scene is a wonderful breath-taking improvement.",1223942400,4,1594,4.823529411764706
882545,5,6304401132,"This is a new release of a Disney classic that first appeared in 1959. As is my custom, I much prefer to watch an animated feature film with several of my younger grandchildren (ages 3-7) and did so again with Sleeping Beauty on its 50th anniversary.  Once again, they were engrossed in the story line whereas I was somewhat more interested in how the quality of animation measures up (after 59 years) when compared and contrasted with recent films such as Toy Story and Toy Story 2, the three Shreks, Ratatouille, Cars, and Wall-E. It measures up remarkably well. Just as there is a certain charm in black-and-white classic films from the 1930's and 40's (e.g. Casablanca, The Little Shop Around the Corner, and It Happened One Night), the same is true of older Disney features (e.g. Dumbo, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and Pinocchio) despite relatively less sophisticated animation.

There were also generational differences when my companions and I examined the special features that include ""Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough (a fully immersive virtual tour), an all-new ""Enchanted Dance Game,"" the ""Dragon Encounter Audio Sensory Experience,"" and an all-new ""Making of Sleeping beauty."" Predictably, my grandchildren much preferred the supplementary games whereas I was (as always) intrigued by the ""behind the screen"" material such as a discussion of the film by John Lasseter of Pixar, the film critic Leonard Maltin, and the Disney animator Andreas Deja. The production values in this new edition are superb, especially in the Blu-ray version.  The running time of 75 minutes seems just about right. Whatever the ages of those who see this film and one or more of its numerous special features, they will find much to enjoy and appreciate.

The story line is strikingly similar to the one in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  A daughter named Aurora is born to royal parents and then cursed to die by her 16th birthday by an evil fairy, Malificent. To protect her, three good fairies take her away, re-name her Briar Rose, and raise her themselves. A handsome prince meets her by chance, they fall in love, and agree to meet again soon. However, on the night of her 16th birthday, as she prepares to return to her parents and be crowned a princess, the evil fairy locates her and then.... Fortunately, everything eventually works out for Aurora as it also does for Snow White, Belle, and other Disney heroines.

I highly recommend this 50th anniversary celebration of one of Disney's most delightful animated films. Although it was under-appreciated when first released, I think it will now receive the praise it so clearly deserves.  Bravo!",1223942400,2,2654,4.990950226244344
882546,5,6304401132,"This movie is a classic. To upgrade it to blu-ray was a brilliant idea by Disney. The graphics and colors are vibrant and stunning.

This made it a must buy since most people with young children have a grandma and grandpa or DVD system in the car that doesn't exactly have a blu-ray player in it.

882547,4,6304401132,"For a fifty year old animated movie, Sleeping Beauty holds up exceptionally well for the modern viewer.  While a bit light on story (evil queen threatens new born princess with curse of death, fairies cause the curse to be limited to slumber, fairies raise princess as a peasant to protect her from curse, curse strikes, etc), Sleeping Beauty tells that story quite well without relying too heavily on over-the-top musical numbers.  Visually, Sleeping Beauty is one of the stronger works of from Disney with a striking Maleficent, contrasts between light and darkness, and one incredibly creepy castle for the evil queen.  Outside of the fairies, the good side is a bit boring, but the three fairies carry the story and breath life into Sleeping Beauty.  Of course, the movie relies on a bit of stupidity on the part of the fairies to actually have a story, but beyond that, the movie works.  This one truly is a classic.

This is the two disc ""Platinum Edition"", however, and there is an abundance of special features.  This set has a commentary track and a trivia track that are each, unfortunately, buried in the bonus features menu on Disc 1.  Rather than having those two features which are designed to play along with the feature be on the main menu, they are each tucked away and easily missed.  The only other features on disc one are a music video from Emily Osment singing the signature song ""Once Upon a Dream"",

The second disc has the bulk of the special features and this is broken into ""Cottage"" and ""Castle"".  ""Cottage"" is designed for the younger viewers with a poorly designed dancing game and a language game so horribly narrated that it is best avoided.  The good stuff (for adults) is in ""Castle"" with a making of, alternate scenes, a 30 minute video with visuals of the Grand Canyon set to music, the original broadcast of a Disney documentary, and all told, if you're looking for bonus footage, this is the disc to get.

On the strength of the art, the fairies, and Maleficent, Sleeping Beauty is a Disney masterpiece.  The Platinum Edition is the DVD to own.",1223683200,3,2082,4.699724517906336
882548,5,6304401132,"Walt Disney released his greatest artistic masterpiece ""Sleeping Beauty"" in February of 1959. After spending 6 million dollars and 8 years in the making of this masterpiece, Sleeping Beauty managed to gross 5.3 million at the box office, certainly not enough for Disney to break even on his greatest artistic achievement in animation. Disney spared no expense on Sleeping Beauty, as he used Technicolor and Technirama 70. Technirama 70 was a special system of film running through the camera horizontally, exposing two 35mm frames simultaneously. This unusual film is then printed normally on standard 35mm film and shown with an anamorphic lens for the widescreen, extra dimension effect.

Unlike Disney's earlier box office successful films of ""Snow White"" and ""Cinderella"", ""Sleeping Beauty"" lacked the music and characters that younger children love. There are no fun songs like ""Heigh Ho"" or ""Cinderelly"" and no adorable little mice like Jacques and Gus. This movie is definitely for a little older audience that appreciates the greatest art ever created for a full length animated movie. To say it is Disney's artistic masterpiece is an understatement! I saw Sleeping Beauty when it premiered in the winter of 1959, and even though I was a small child, it was then and is still now my absolute favorite Disney movie of all time!

This new blu-ray version of ""Sleeping Beauty"" made me feel as though I was seeing it again in 1959! This is the widest version I have ever seen and when you add hi-def 1080p and the all new digital restoration to it, it's like seeing it for the first time ever! Everything is so colorful, super wide, sharper, brighter than you can imagine! You can see every crack in every brick and stone! I am keeping my fingers crossed, that they treat more of the other great old Disney films with this same blu-ray restoration, as it's like seeing the film like you've never seen it before!

""Sleeping Beauty"" may not be known for it's songs, like in ""Snow White"" or it's cute characters in ""Cinderella"", but it is known for the most fantastic hand drawn art that will never be surpassed by anyone ever again. Every scene is pure art in it's highest form due to the fantastic work of the best Disney artists of the time. This blu-ray dvd has a Bonus Feature disc that features many of the artists that contributed to this masterpiece. Seeing Eyvind Earle, who was given complete control of every artistic aspect of the film, along with other artists Marc Davis, Mary Blair, Ken Anderson and others is a real treat!

This bonus disc also features the beautiful Mary Costa, whose looks and gorgeous voice made Princess Aurora come to life. We also get to see Bill Shirley, the voice of Prince Phillip, Eleanor Audley, the voice of Maleficent as well as the wicked stepmother in Cinderella (She is the best villainess voice of any in animation!) and of course the three good fairies Verna Felton the voice of Flora, Barbara Jo Allen the voice of Fauna and Barbara Luddy the voice of Merryweather. This is so great as Disney shows how the people whose voices played the characters look so much like the characters! Of course they show how the film looks like Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty music seems to have been written for this Disney masterpiece, instead of the other way around!

More Bonus features include a Maleficent game, learning to waltz, an all new dragon encounter and a never before seen alternate opening. The best bonus feature for me is the Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough. This is unbelievable, to be able to take a digitally re-created 3-D tour of Sleeping Beauty's Castle, just as it was in 1957 and 1958 (two years before the movie premiered)in Disneyland in California! What a treat! If you don't have a blu-ray player, now is the time to get one to enjoy the most breathtaking Disney masterpiece ever created! Sleeping Beauty is pure art in every way one can imagine from it's Tchaikovsky music to it's fairy tale of how good always conquers evil, but mainly for the opulent, gorgeous art dominated by the talents of Eyvind Earle's scenery and Marc Davis' characters- it's a rare treat for the senses and one you don't want to miss!",1223596800,13,4180,4.808066759388039
882549,5,6304401132,"I was skeptical about buying an animated movie in blu-ray.  I can't even express how amazing this movie looks!  The color is outstanding, the scenery better than I would have ever thought possible.  All the dotty looks of the old-style Disney movies has been completely erased with this enhancement and yet, you lose none of the nostalgic feel.  The story is one of the best, as always and the characters are wonderful.  The sound is fabulous AND you get a bonus regular dvd with this purchase which I think is wonderful (Yay portible DVD player for trips!).  If you are on the rail about buying animated blu-ray like I was, don't be with this one!  I bought mine on sale, but I would have paid full-price for how amazing this looks.  I would recommend this to anyone.",1223596800,4,768,4.554744525547445
882550,5,6304401132,"This movie is a classic.  Many reviews here describe why this movie is just that and I won't dwell on those aspects of the movie.  I will say this though.

This is my absolute favorite of the Disney classics.  The art direction is simply superb, many scenes present themselves as multi-layered moving story books.  It not only is an interesting direction, but is entirely complimentary to the midieval fairy tale setting of the movie.

The story is wonderfully and efficiently written, and includes Disney's most memorable villian.  This movie truly is a stylistic classic, a giant among it's peers.

Per this blu-ray speicfically, this movie looks like it could have been produced yesterday.  The absolute crispness of the backgrounds, especially forgrounds during closeups is stunning.  I will say I did notice some softness of character in mid-ground shots, but what could you expect of a movie of this vintage.  Even the live action shots of the story book opening is extrodinarily detailed.

And it sounds great, 7.1 surround sound in hi-def DTS-HD MA audio.  For a movie that was originally recorded in hi-tech (at the time) stereophonic sound, the surround effects and ""presence"" and superb.  Another masterful job by Disney.

Bonus features:
This 2 disc set includes an exhaustive set of bonus features, in line with high profile Disney releases.  These include, numerous making of and historical bits, the standard interactive game and next-gen features such as BD-live and Picture-in-Picture ""Cine-explore"". Additionally included is a limited time pack-in of a standard DVD disc.  Personally, I find the BD-live features are of limited value but many might find the opportunity to send piture mail to friends over the Disney BD-live system fun.  I do think the limited time DVD pack-in is a great bonus for those that have portable regular DVD players such as in-car models.  Why buy 2 discs if you have kids and are interested in making sure your movie purchases work with mobile needs.

All, in all, this edition including the extensive bonus features make this movie a nobrainer as a first purchase or an upgrade from VHS and a highly recommend for people upgrading from DVD.",1223596800,5,2188,5.041782729805014
882551,5,6304401132,"""Sleeping Beauty"" is a magnificent adventure now in widescreen with sumptuous detail. The backgrounds have a lush intricate medieval design while the characters seem to float through each scene effortlessly. I found the movie to be especially calming and filled with luminous beauty. Each scene is exquisite, like a painting in motion. The handmade animation has been restored to a new level of brilliance. The colors are gorgeous and keep your attention even more than the storyline, which is a bit slow in places.

The basic story revolves around three good fairies who protect princess Aurora for sixteen years. Nothing too interesting happens until Maleficent (an evil fairy) transforms herself into a dragon and then the story finally has a formidable villain, which makes it a bit more exciting. However, prince Phillip seems unable to slay Maleficent until he is helped by the three good fairies. They keep the story alive and fresh with all their magic. It is fun to watch them triumph over evil. Still, the fairies are not able to undo Maleficent's curse on the princess Aurora who falls into a deep sleep after pricking her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle created by the evil fairy. The only way she can awaken is to receive a kiss from her true love. Maleficent tries to make this an impossibility, but somehow good overcomes evil in the end.

Since this was my first time to see Sleeping Beauty I had never realized it was a story about an arranged marriage. Fortunately princess Aurora meets prince Phillip in the forest before the wedding takes place. To me, princess Aurora looked twenty not sixteen. The only other difference from the story I heard as a child was that Princess Aurora doesn't sleep for a hundred years. Everything else was exactly as I imagined it to be. This movie has a perfection that is rare and beautiful and it is definitely a movie worth collecting.

882552,5,6304401132,"For all of the thirty two years I've been on this planet, ""Sleeping Beauty"" was one of the few Disney films that I never viewed.  My wife and daughter have watched it numerous times on VHS, but I either wasn't home at the time or I was interested in something else.  My wife considers this film to be her favorite Disney movie.  Having watched it for the first time tonight, I understand why.

The Disney version of this fairy tale is inspired by Tchaikovsky's ballet.  With the wonderful ""Once Upon A Dream"" waltz, a cast of likeable characters including the fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather and a classic Disney villain in Maleficent, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is two parts love story and one part action yarn.  Humor is provided by the fathers of Aurora and Prince Philip, as well as the fairies.

For those unfamiliar with the story, Maleficent casts a spell on the infant Aurora.  On her sixteenth birthday, she is to fall into a deadly sleep.  Luckily the kind fairy Merryweather had not yet given Aurora a gift.  In order to save her life, Merryweather casts a protective spell that prevents Aurora from passing away but puts her into a deep sleep.  This slumber can only be broken by her true love's kiss.  From there, the story has magic, a dragon, and an ending that's both beautiful and funny.

The 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Walt Disney's classic is a masterpiece.  The film looks beautiful.  It is set in a widescreen format and has been digitally restored to a colorful and eye-popping presentation.  The sound is also excellent and the music is simply wonderful.

The DVD is loaded with special features.  It includes an alternate opening sequence, a game in which you can learn a waltz, a look into the life of Tchaikovsky, the musical ""Grand Canyon Suite"" and much, much more.  Heck, even the standard Disney Channel television star music video is good.  This time around it's Emily Osment's popped-up version of ""Once Upon A Dream.""

I can honestly say that ""Sleeping Beauty"" has worked her way into my top ten list of Disney films.  It's a wonderful film for the whole family and deserves a spot on everybody's DVD (or Blu-ray) shelf.",1223510400,5,2161,4.721925133689839
882706,5,6304401132,"Disney's first classic to hit Blu-Ray is spectacular!  I have to admit that Sleeping Beauty isn't one of my favorite Disney movies, but I pretty much like them all is some way or another.  Why then the five stars?  The conversion to Blu-Ray is spot on!!!  I can't wait for them to convert the rest of the library, this is the way these movies are meant to be seen.  Not to mention I have barely tapped into BDlive yet (so far seems very cool).",1223510400,4,443,4.226190476190476
882707,5,6304401132,"From what I gathered from viewing the interviews on the most recent ""Platinum"" release of ""Sleeping Beauty"" this was Disney Studios' pinnacle of achievement in animation of that time. And indeed, the artistry is stunningly beautiful.  You get the full scope of what was put into it with this new widescreen edition.  However, unless you have a large wide-screen TV, the characters are nearly overwhelmed by the wide and ""busy"" background art.  The Full-Screen version seems to give one more of a 'personal' experience with the characters whereas the wide picture seems to distance you from them.
As for story, it is the 3 Good Fairies that carry the movie and have the best material.  Princess Aurora and Prince Philip seem almost incidental characters built around the story of the 3 fairies' heroics (Aurora and Philip have an amazingly small amount of dialogue).  Don't get me wrong, I love this movie, but next to ""Cinderella"" all the extravagance of ""Sleeping Beauty"" does not hold a candle.",1223424000,,996,4.975903614457831
882708,5,6304401132,"To be very honest, I debated on whether or not to purchase this edition of Sleeping Beauty because I have the 2003 version.  I was skeptical because I was afraid that the bonus features on this new edition would excluded the Grand Canyon featurette and the Story of Peter Tchaikovsky until lo and behold, it was included.  I have yet to have seen all of the bonus features of the DVD but the film looks and sounds greater than the 2003 version  I noticed more detail and the sound was outstanding.  The Disneyland Walk-Through feature was just breathtaking as this was the version I never saw.

I strongly recommend this for any Disney fan!",1223337600,11,640,4.578947368421052
882709,5,6304401132,"Most new Disney editions have been improvements over what has come before, but this new edition of SLEEPING BEAUTY is an unparalleled improvement on all previous editions.  Before receiving the new Platinum DVD copy I dipped back briefly into my old VHS copy that I had for my daughter when she was a child.  4:3 ratio, poor color, in general nothing special.

I then put in the disc for the new Platinum edition.  I was utterly and absolutely astonished.  Widescreen instead of 4:3.  The improvement in the color was unbelievable.  Now, I have to offer a disclaimer.  I watched the Platinum edition on a Philips up-conversion DVD player.  Unless you own an up-conversion DVD player and a high-def TV it won't look this good for you (though it is also available in Blu-ray -- I would love to have checked this out on Blu-ray through my Sony PS3, but I only had the regular DVD).  But with my set up the results were nothing short of spectacular.  I was absolutely thrilled with the results.  Even if you have a relatively low-tech DVD set up, this is going to be a vast improvement over the old VHS edition.

SLEEPING BEAUTY has always had special emotional importance for me.  My Dad and I never did much stuff together.  I don't have many childhood memories of just me and him.  But for some reason he took me, when I was a very small child, to the theater to see SLEEPING BEAUTY.  I believe that it was the only movie that only he and I ever saw.  My mother took me to many, many movies, but my father only this.  We would later go as a family to many movies, but this one was just the two of us.  This alone would mark this as a special movie.  This new edition brings back the original big screen experience that I had at the Markham Street Cinema (since torn down) in Little Rock, Arkansas as a small child.

As an adult SLEEPING BEAUTY is both a wonderful experience and something approaching self-parody.  There is A-List Disney and B-List Disney.  SLEEPING BEAUTY is without any question A-List.  It was one of the last feature length films done before the institution of the Xerox process.  I consider it the end of the Golden Age of Disney.  It ends the era that began with SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  The self-parody comes out in the endless take offs on elements contained in the film.  The recent (and exceptionally good) Disney film ENCHANTED takes off on the aspects of this film that shows Aurora as intimate friends with wild animals.  It is also seen in SHREK when Princess Fiona sings and makes wild birds explode.

The was the last Disney film to be completely hand painted.  ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS, the next major Disney production, utilized a xerox process that eliminated the need for most of the background painters.  The difference between this and subsequent films is palpable.  While the economics of the industry dictated that the switch to Xerox be made, it is truly said that the transformation was made.

As a child, I found this to be far and away the most terrifying of all the Disney films.  I stil vividly remember the horror I felt as the Prince chopped his way through the barrier of thorns that surrounded the castle and the terrifying transformation of Mileficent into a terrible dragon.

If you are already a fan of SLEEPING BEAUTY then this is a must-owen film.  If you don't know the movie, this is the only edition that you should consider for your first encounter.  As I've learned first hand, all of the Disney re-releases of their movies are utterly first rate.  But this is one of the great Disney movies.  We get not only a exquisite version of a Disney movie, but a first rate version of one of the greatest fims that Disney had mde.",1223251200,6,3697,4.52416918429003
882710,5,6304401132,"Walt Disney's 1958 ""Sleeping Beauty"" marked the end of the studio's first golden era and, by extension, an era in American filmmaking. Watching this 50th anniversary edition (the most lovingly compiled among these 2DVD resissue series sets), you sense everyone involved - Disney's legendary ""Nine Old Men,"" animators, Walt himself, even the characters on screen - knew it.

For years Disney called his TV show, ""The Wonderful World of Color,"" but in ""Sleeping Beauty"" he told an admittedly thin story (adapting an opulent Tchaikovsky soundtrack)almost through vividness alone. Sets overflow with near 3D level detail and depth, swirling scene to scene and rewarding the eye when stopping a frame. Green dominates: Princess Aurora's ponders and meets her future in the pastoral forest singing ""I Wonder,"" dark pea-moss clouds surround and shadow villanous Maleficient's castle (joining royal purple in her angry frustration) or green flames where Aurora's betrothed Prince Philip defeats her in the film's climax.

Eyvind Earle's justifiably praised art background (feted in a DVD bonus) rests behind loveable ancillary characters. Three fussy good fairies (distinctive to the film's betterment by ""Old Men"" Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas,over Disney's objection), sweet forest animals always in Disney's repertory, a jolly king and tipsy troubadour jester divert and move the plot, pumping humor and life into a film little about plot to start with.

""Sleeping Beauty"" was about allowing Disney's audiences one last unabashedly romantic, unironic visit to 14th century fantasyland, to the sword of truth and shield of virtue where (as Maleficient mocks),""True love does conquer all"" and good fairy Fauna cries, ""I just love happy endings."" Almost every animated feature to follow, starting with Disney's 1961's ""101 Dalmations,"" gave a sly wink or modern in-joke reference, stretching right to Princess Fiona's parody of forest scene in Dreamworks' 2000 postmodern masterpiece, ""Shrek.""

""Sleeping Beauty""'s bonus features acknowledge its cross-generational appeal. Three exceptional documentaries address its making (one covers the lengthy, excruciating ""Sequence 8"" alone). You get an instructive if overdramatic vintage ""Disneyland"" Tchaikovsky bio, featuring Walt Disney's explaining of ""Sleeping Beauty""'s Technirama 70mm filming style and demonstrating stereophonic sound and widescreen picture. You get an intriguing if conventional alternative opening, deleted songs and storyboards.

You also get children's word and dance games and Emily Osment's gawky teen-pop version of Sammy Fain's ""Once Upon A Dream."" But the most notable extra is the film's digital remastering and soundtrack. It takes advantage of Blu-Ray and other home theater technology in ways even visionary Walt could not have imagined previewing the film for his TV audience. (To illustrate, compare this print with the bonus trailers from the film's re-releases). ""Sleeping Beauty"" stands as one of Disney's most important achievements artistically and historically, and this 50th anniversary set is the most complete and essential way to own it.",1223251200,3,3123,5.736501079913607
882711,5,6304401132,"The Sleeping Beauty story never gets old, no matter how old you are or how long ago you saw it. But this Platinum Edition brings out the best in the story with a great-looking digitally restored picture, making it now even harder to forget with colors that jump at you. If you can watch the movie on a widescreen TV you will enjoy it at its fullest as it was the first one that Disney did on 70 mm film.

Alongside the unforgettable tale, there are lots of extra material packing the two discs, such as children games, a great documentary on the making of the movie and even a short on the life of Tchaikovsky (whose music is featured on the film) that make this package a must have for Disney fans.",1223251200,,699,4.2556390977443606
882712,5,6304401132,"Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY is based upon the story of Briar Rose by the Brothers Grimm.  In this version of the tale, a beautiful baby girl named Aurora is born to a friendly king and queen.  After her birth people and creatures from all around come to give her gifts, including three good fairies.  Two of the fairies give their gifts to the child but before the third fairy is able to do so, an un-invited guest, the evil sorceress Malificient, appears and places a curse upon the child.  Before the end of Aurora's birthday she will prick her finger upon the spindle of a spinning wheel and die.  After Malificient leaves, the third fairy bestows her gift: instead of dying, Aurora will only fall into a deep slumber when the event happens and will only awaken with true love's kiss.  The fairies take Aurora and hide her and raise her deep in the woods as their own child.  When Aurora meets her true love, Prince Phillip, it would seem that everything is going to work out as planned.  But in fairy tales, even a Disneyized version of one, nothing is quite as it seems.

SLEEPING BEAUTY had been in pre-production and production for almost a decade before it was originally released in theatres in 1958.  The film was incredibly expensive to make and had it failed it would have bankrupted the studio.  In fact, the film was so expensive that it was the last Disney animated picture to mostly have hand-drawn animated cells for each frame of the picture.  Xeroxing was king after that and a glory age of animation came to an end.  The film turned out to be a huge critical and financial success and remains as one of the most beautiful animated Disney features ever.  The influence of the movie can clearly be seen on modern animated pictures, most prominently Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  The movie also contains some very memorable Disney characters, including the most wicked of all Disney villains, Malificient.

Besides the visual impact of the picture, the film is also notable for it's very un-Disney-like score.  The film was scored by an adaptation of George Bruns from Tchaikovsky's famous ballet, SLEEPING BEAUTY.

As beautiful and stunning a movie that SLEEPING BEAUTY is, it has one major drawback.  Like all Disney animated pictures, the writers in adapting the original story failed to include some of the more dark and graphic parts of the story of Briar Rose, e.g. as the final confrontation between Malificient and Prince Phillip.  Other than that, though, SLEEPING BEAUTY is a meticulously-crafted example of the art of animation and one of the most beautifully drawn pictures ever to grace cinema screens.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Disney films or well-done animation.

The special 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of the movie comes with two discs.  The first disc includes the movie in widescreen digitally restored format; ""Once Upon a Dream"" music video with Emily Osment; song selections that can be played with or without lyrics; a commentary with John Lasseter, Andreas Deja, and Leonard Maltin; ""Princess Facts"" (pop-up factoids that appear while watching the movie); the short pictorial GRAND CANYON (this was the short that originally accompanied SLEEPING BEAUTY in theatres); and a Walt Disney special entitled ""Peter Tchaikovsky Story"", which was the first tv program to be simulcast in widescreen picture and stereo sound

The second disc is a special feature disc. It includes the documentary ""Picture Perfect: Making of SLEEPING BEAUTY""; a featurette about Eyvind Earle; a featurette about how expensive the picture was to make; the original planned opening sequence of the movie; three deleted songs; two storyboard sequences; a virtual tour through the now closed Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland; a Disney special entitled ""Four Artists Painting a Tree"" (which is really just a long commercial for SLEEPING BEAUTY disguised as a show to encourage young artists); art galleries; trailers for the film; a matching game; and a language game.  I found the documentary about the making of the movie to be really interesting as well as the story about the history of the Sleeping Beauty Castle attraction at Disneyland.  I found the two games to be the least-interesting thing on the DVD.  Disney puts those things on there for young children, but I really think they are a waste of space and time.",1223251200,,4357,4.949175824175824
882713,5,6304401132,"The story of Sleeping Beauty is a timeless classic.  And the Disney version is my favorite overall.  The demure Aurora is sweet, kind, and innocent and has a simple and understated beauty to her.  Her song ""Once Upon A Dream"" is one of the most beautiful songs in the Disney songbook.  The colors used in the film are stunning.  And, last but never least, the villain Maleficent is one of the most evil Disney villains ever created with the blackest of hearts.  I root for her every time I watch the movie.  Who doesn't love someone who gets all mad and exacts revenge just because she's not invited to a party?!  Talk about holding a grudge...  She truly is the Mistress of All Evil.",1223251200,,684,4.451612903225806
882714,5,6304401132,"It has been over two decades since I last saw Disney's animated film SLEEPING BEAUTY. I was just a small child in elementary school when I first saw the film. Once again, Disney digs deep into their vault and re-releases the classic animated film as part of their platinum edition series. The two dvd set includes the remastered version of the film and a slew of bonus features that the family is sure to enjoy.

The story of Aurora, princess to King Stefan, she is a welcomed into the kingdom with a lavished celebration. The infant is greeted by King Hubert and his son Prince Philip, whom Aurora is betrothed to marry later in life. Then Aurora is paid a visit by the three good fairies Fauna, Merryweather, and Flora. Flora and Fauna are able to bless the child with the gift of beauty and song but before Merryweather could bless the child, the evil witch Maleficent drops in unexpectedly. Displeased that her presence was not wanted at the celebration, Maleficent curses the child that she will die at the age of 16 with a single prick to her finger by a spindle. Thankfully Merryweather weakens the curse to simply a deep sleep. Reluctantly, King Steffan allows the three good fairies to take Aurora out of the kingdom until she is the age of 16, to protect Auroa from Maleficent's curse.

As mere mortals, the three fairies raises Aurora as Briar Rose in the forest without raising a suspicion. In the meantime, Maleficent has her army (who are totally incompetent for comedic value) out searching for Aurora for 16 years. When she realizes her army's mistake of looking for a baby for 16 years, Maleficent sends out her pet raven Diablo to search for Aurora. With the assistance of the fairies, Prince Philip goes to rescue the princess who had fallen under the evil witch's spell.

Everything you expect in a Disney animated film is there, song, comedy, drama, and a anti-climatic ending is here in the lavished remastered film. This was the first time I have seen SLEEPING BEAUTY since I was a child. I almost forgotten how good this film is. The colors in this new version is vibrant. The music is beautiful. The music in today's Disney animated films lacks the beauty and elegence of the classic Disney films like the orchestral score for SLEEPING BEAUTY. Once again Disney does a wonderful job at remastering and re-packaging SLEEPING BEAUTY.",1223164800,2,2356,4.713592233009709

I guess they started a little early with this one.

Fated to an eternal sleep upon reaching the age of 16, she is given somewhat of a reprieve by one of the Good Fairies who bestows upon Aurora the blessing of being reawakened by true love's kiss. The 3 Good Fairies (Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna) take Aurora into the woods as a baby and raise her as Briar Rose in order to keep her away from Maleficent, hopefully avoiding the curse in the first place. However, on the crest of her 16th birthday, Aurora happens to meet Prince Phillip and naturally falls in love. Neither knows the true identity of the other and that their kingdoms have already decreed that they marry each other. When she is returned to her parents, the King & Queen, Aurora is upset that she cannot marry her boyfriend from the woods, and instead, must marry a Prince she has not met (as far as she knows). Maleficent finds the Princess and carries out her original curse. Can Prince Philip save the Princess with true love's kiss?

The film looks and sounds spectacular. Shot in Super Technirama 70, the widescreen (2.55:1 enhanced for 16x9 TVs) film has been restored using state-of-the-art technology, and will fill up your speakers with its 5.1 enhanced home theater mix. For purists, the restored original theater track is also included. Either way you choose, Mary Costa (the voice of Aurora) sounds incredible. It would be hard to imagine anyone else vocalizing the Princess with such warmth and beauty. Eleanor Audley also deserves kudos for her vocalization of the evil Maleficent. She is definitely one of the most scary and memorable Disney characters.

This project was special to Walt; it was the last feature based on a fairy-tale (until 1989's ""Little Mermaid""). Since the studio had already done a similar tale with ""Snow White,"" Walt wanted to make it different by adding a classical music inspired Tchaikovsky score and giving the film a less cartoony and more artistic visual representation. Breaking all box-office records, this film succeeded on all levels.

And the extras...wow! On Disc One, in addition to the feature, you get:

*Music & More: ""Once Upon A Dream"" music video performed by Hannah Montana's Emily Osment, who updates the song with a pop rock beat

* Disney Song Selection: Instantly access your favorite songs from the movie

* Backstage Disney includes audio commentary for the film (John Lasseter, film critic Leonard Maltin, and Disney animator Andreas Dja), Princess Fun Facts (pop-up trivia fact option while watching the movie), ""Grand Canyon"" short (1959 Oscar winner for best short subject film and features the music of Ferde Grof's ""Grand Canyon Suite""), and The Peter Tchaikovsky Story. The Peter Tchaikovsky story was featured on the 1959 Walt Disney Presents anthology. It was a historic telecast due to the fact that home viewers could listen in true-stereophonic sound, by turning on two additional radios with ABC simulcast of the necessary stereophonic channels. Disney explains the process at the beginning of the featurette. You can choose between this version and the version that replaces Disney's explanation. Although the featurette was first broadcast in black and white, it was shot in color. The remaining color footage is here on this DVD set.

* Naturally, there are trailers/promos for other Disney films, including the upcoming theatrical release ""Princess & The Frog"" and the next Platinum Edition DVD release, ""Pinocchio.""

Extras on Disc 2:

Games & Activities:
* Briar Rose's Enchanted Dance Game: Learn to Waltz, taking on the role of Princess Aurora or Prince Phillip.
* ""Sleeping Beauty"" Fun With Language Game. This one is definitely for VERY young children who must identify the most basic of words using visuals from the film.

Backstage Disney:
* Picture Pefect: The Making Of ""Sleeping Beauty"" (43:32) A wonderful documentary detailing the making of the movie. Features interviews with animators and Mary Costa, who is still beautiful today. Watching this will definitely enhance your appreciation for this movie as the artistic masterpiece that it is.
* Eyvind Earle: The Man and His Art (7:33) is about the man responsible for the artistic backgrounds and overall look of the film. Disney stepped up everyone's game at the animation studio by having Earle oversee the design. Features interviews with Alice Davis and John Canemaker.
* Alternate Opening (3:28) is recreated with storyboards and sketches. After viewing this, I'd say they made the right decision, as the music intended for this sequence was more pop-oriented and not fitting the classical Tchaikovsky score.
* 3 Deleted Songs
* 8 Art Galleries, including visual design, character development, storyboards, publicity, and a detailed look at the Storybook featured in the film's opening,
* Original Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle walkthrough attraction, unseen for years, presented in a virtual digital recreation which is BREATHTAKING. Almost like being at Disneyland. ""Tour"" it yourself, or with host Tony Baxter explaining your tour as you go through. There is also a featurette explaining the history of the walkthrough.
* Sequence 8 (Forest Scene) (5:30) is a featurette that shows the detail and labor that went into this sequence put together by Disney's famous ""Nine Old Men."" This sequence alone cost the studio over $10,000. It is also interesting to note that only about 8 drawings were able to be done per day because of the precision required; considering it takes 24 to make a second of film, well...you do the math.
* Publicity features 3 trailers (teaser, original 1959, and 1995 re-release)
* ""Four Artists Paint One Tree"" (16:08) is a 1958 featurette that has four Disney artists (Marc Davis, Eyvind Earle, Joshua Meador, and Walt Peregoy) painting the same tree, each showing their own personal style. Walt Disney himself encourages each to ""be themselves."" An excellent lesson for budding young artists.
* Storyboard sequences
* Live-action reference footage. See three of the black and white films that were shot to aid the animators. Especially fun to watch is the sequence where Prince Phillip fights the dragon.

882824,4,6304401132,"This is another classic fairy tale given the Disney treatment.  The story is rather familiar.  When the Princess Aurora is born, she is presented to her kingdom.  Yet the celebration is short lived when the evil enchantress Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) shows up uninvited.  As retaliation, she curses the baby to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die by the evening of her sixteenth birthday.

Fortunately, the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are there to soften the curse.  Aurora won't die, just fall into an enchanted sleep so only love's first kiss can wake her.  They even plot to hide and raise Aurora as their own to keep the curse from coming true.  Will that plan succeed?  Is there any way to defeat Maleficent?

This movie is often praised for it's look, and rightly so.  Based on artwork from the Middle Ages, it provides a stylized look.  The amount of detail in the backgrounds alone is amazing.  The characters fit this stylized world while still looking real.  Additionally, the background music is majestic.  It is adapted from bits and pieces of Tchaikovsky's ballet based on the fairy tale, and it fits the look of the film perfectly.

And as much as it looks and sounds great, this isn't my favorite of the Disney princess movies.  There is only one song from the movie that is at all memorable.  ""Once Upon a Dream"" is great.  The others are choral pieces that slow things down.  Speaking of slowing things down, the prologue, while needed to set up the story, is very slow.  Once we get to Aurora's sixteenth birthday, things pick up.  But even then, the princess comes across as a boring character.  The thing that saves this film story wise are the fairies.  The three good fairies are wonderfully funny.  And Maleficent is an exciting evil villain.  In fact, she might scare young kids.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie.  But when compared to Disney's other fairy tales, it is a little weak.",1221264000,,1951,4.6923076923076925

882930,3,6304401132,"The movie is cute, but I have a few problems with it that ultimately made me decide not to buy it after I rented it:

1) It's too much like one of Tchaikovsky's ballets, of which I'm not much of a fan.  I haven't seen his version of Sleeping Beauty (on which this was based), but I have seen his version of The Nutcracker; if you like to watch ballet, you might enjoy this one, but otherwise, no.  It is not the kind of thing I would expect from a Disney movie.

2) We don't see enough of Aurora or Prince Phillip.  (In fact, it seems that Aurora is better known through Disney Princess products than through the actual movie.)  We see them dance together one time, and then they don't do much after that.  OK, we can forgive the fact that Aurora sleeps on the job (which is really what she's doing; the original tale had her sleep for a hundered years and not meet the prince until he woke her up), because it is, after all, Sleeping Beauty.  But even when Phillip is trying to rescue her, he's just a paper tiger; the fairies do all the work by releasing him from his prison, giving him a sword and shield, turning the arrows that are shot at him into flowers, etc.  It's really the fairies who rescue her, while the prince gets all the credit--and no one in the movie notices this!  Again, this is not what I expect to see in a Disney movie.

Still, it's interesting to watch from the point of view of a student of animation.  Fans of Nintendo will notice how much the castle looks like the castle from Super Mario Bros. and how much one of Maleficent's henchmen looks like Ganon (the villain from The Legend of Zelda).

If you want a better movie with a similar concept, try Snow White.  If you want one of Disney's movies from around that time, try Cinderella.  My absolute favorite Disney Movie is The Little Mermaid; if you haven't already, I recommend that you buy that one instead.",1205798400,2,1890,4.314447592067989
883001,5,6304401132,"5 STARS (HIGHEST RATING):  THE MOVIE, THE MONEY, & THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY DVD:

""Sleeping Beauty"" (1959) marked a stunning departure from the usual ""house style"" of animation at Disney Studios. The Disney Version, principally designed by artistic genius Eyvind Earle, is most definitely set in an enchanted, 14th Century, Medieval Kingdom. Earle gets his own DVD featurette entitled ""Eyvind Earle: The Man And His Art.""
  Legend has it that ""Sleeping Beauty"" took six years to create (but according to the new 2008 ""Picture Perfect: The Making Of Sleeping Beauty"" DVD Documentary, the film was actually in various stages of development for nearly a decade) at a cost of $6 Million Dollars. And, for once, you can see every penny up on the screen. (The 2008 DVD release has an even ""wider"" Widescreen aspect than the 2003 release). Everything is so detailed and lush, it adds up to an addictive movie experience that invites multiple viewings. Pefection came at a heavy price; both financially and personally. Walt Disney himself spared no expense to have Tchikovsky's stirring musical score recorded at a Stereophonic Studio in Germany, and that had nothing to do with the actual animation! Upon first release, the film made an impressive $3 million, but that was only half its cost. Nevertheless, the film won prophetic and instant praise as ""an unmatched vision of pagentry and adventure."" Certainly, the film has now made back its cost with theatrical re-issues, video, DVD, and Blue-Ray releases.
  Many artists in addition to Eyvind Earle labored on ""Sleeping Beauty."" Sequence director Eric Larson worked on the infamous Sequence 8 (Princess Aurora meets Prince Phillip in the forest) for well over a year. When that sequence alone cost $10,000 Disney fired Larson from ""Sleeping Beauty"" and put him to work on ""101 Dalmations."" Disney later told Larson that animated features  (Once, Disney's bread and butter) were just too expensive and might well bankrupt the studio.
  By the mid-1950's, Walt Disney's time and interests were occupied with opening Disneyland theme park, live-action movies and ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" TV Show."" Disneyland opened in 1955. In 1957, Walt Disney was wise enough to promote ""Sleeping Beauty"" with a park attraction two years before the film's release. The original ""Sleeping Beauty"" Attraction is recreated as a ""Virtual Walk-Through"" DVD Bonus Feature.
  Disney was determined not to (exactly) repeat his own fairy-tale past. Although visually sophisticated, the film tells the story in straightforward fashion. ""Sleeping Beauty"" is blessedly free of the ""comic bits of business, tricks"" and ""story padding"" found in ""Snow White"" and ""Cinderella."" Three tiny good faeries  named Flora, Fauna and Merriweather attempt to save Princess Aurora from the curse of ""Mistress Of All Evil"" Malificent, voiced with  chilling authority by Eleanor Audley (who also voiced Lady Tremine, the abusive Stepmother of ""Cinderella""). A nice case of ""mistaken identity"" is also employed in the narrative. When Phillip  (voiced by Bill Shirley) and Aurora meet in the forest, he thinks she is a peasant girl. Aurora falls in love with him not knowing that he is the Prince she has been betrothed to since birth. Indeed, she (going by the name Briar Rose) does not yet know she is really Princess Aurora at all. While the ""Prince Charmings"" in ""Snow White"" and ""Cinderella"" are bland afterthoughts; essentially footnotes to the plot, Prince Phillip takes an extremely active role in saving both Aurora and his Kingdom from Malificent. She hisses, ""Now you shall deal with me, Oh Prince, and all the Powers Of HELL"", as she transforms herself into a fire-spewing dragon. What follows is one of the most thrilling and nightmarish battles of good vs. evil in cinema history. Prince Phillip just barely survives, but he emerges as a strong and hunky hero we can be proud. True, Aurora herself takes a back seat to the faeries, Malificent, and Prince Phillip. But critics who complain about Aurora's secondary role should remember that, in the original fairy-tale, the title Princess does FAR LESS! Whereas Snow White is depicted as an innocent child, Aurora is very much a lovely young woman who is clearly ready for the romance she longs for. And she is beautifully voiced by soprano Mary Costa.
  Animators John Lasseter, Andreas Deja, and ""Entertainment Tonight's"" Leonard Maltin provide  lively and informative Audio Commentary that is far superior to the grim and dreary tone of the Commentary on the 2003 DVD release. Among other things, we learn that Eleanor Audley initally turned down the choice role of Malificent because she was battling tuberculosis. Fortunately, she eventually  felt better enough to do the voice recordings. ""Sleeping Beauty"" was also the last feature to be completely drawn, inked, and painted by hand. Afterwards, the Studio moved to the less expensive Xerox process for the modern-day story of ""101 Dalmations.""
  I find ""Sleeping Beauty"" to be an absolutely  hypnotic and mesmerizing film; one that should be cherished forever. On the occasion of its 50th Anniversary, I hope it is finally regarded as  an apex in animation and the Crown Jewel of Disney's fairy-tale features.
""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of a kind, and the last one of its kind.",1205107200,2,5291,5.149358226371062

As for me, I'd say that regardless of what you read into it, Sleeping Beauty is a must-own, especially if you have a Blu-Ray system and a huge widescreen television. A true Disney classic, the movie has such colorful and stunning visuals -- and such a strong villain -- that it makes up for its one major flaw: the lack of a good lead character.

The art, for example, is astounding. Full of bright 1950s color, each background is a stylized, graphic collage of rectangles and straight lines that is also filled to the edges with meticulous details, every one in sharp focus. For each tree you see every leaf. For each shrub you see every thorn. It's as if the producers had Blu-Ray in mind when they made it.

As a whole, the characters are terrific. Kids will love the fairies. On-screen longer than anyone else, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather fly like bumblebees, have lots of personality and are truly funny. They lose their temper and make many mistakes, especially when it comes to baking a birthday cake or sewing a dress.

The villain is perhaps the scariest in any Disney film. ""The mistress of all evil,"" devil-horned, green-skinned Maleficent is a high-class, sarcastic horror show all by herself. She curses baby Aurora to death, later imprisons a prince so that he can't save the girl, and eventually turns herself into a towering dragon that breathes green fire.

In fact, the movie's only weakness is the princess herself. Aurora -- dare I say it? -- is quite a snooze. Unlike the lead characters in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella/dp/B0007Z9R7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs/dp/B00003CXCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>, this 16-year-old has an oh-so-plain, passive personality. With no history of being mistreated, she looks like a Barbie doll and sings like an opera star. You just can't relate to her.

Still, the art is fantastic, children -- especially girls -- will love the story and parents can easily sit through it. This is the first Disney classic princess movie on Blu-Ray, and it's a fine start.",1205020800,8,3211,6.421296296296297

It's a look that set the stage for other Disney movies to come, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pocahontas/dp/B0007KTBIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pocahontas</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulan/dp/B00024I2Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hercules/dp/B00004R99S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hercules</a>.

As a whole, the characters are terrific. Kids will love the fairies. On-screen longer than anyone else, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather fly like bumblebees, ooze oodles of personality and are truly funny. They lose their temper and make many mistakes, especially in their attempts to bake a birthday cake and sew a dress.

The villain is perhaps the scariest in any Disney film. ""The mistress of all evil,"" devil-horned, green-skinned Maleficent is a sarcastic, high-class horror show all by herself. She curses baby Aurora to death, imprisons a prince so that he can't save the grown girl, and eventually turns herself into a towering dragon that breathes green fire.

The movie's only weakness is the princess herself. Aurora -- dare I say it? -- is quite a snooze. Unlike the leads in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella/dp/B0007Z9R7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs/dp/B00003CXCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>, this 16-year-old is a plain, passive Barbie doll who sings like an opera star. Unlike Cinderella or Snow White, she has no history of being mistreated. She's likable enough, but tough to relate to.

Still, that's the opinion of an adult, not a child. I give Sleeping Beauty five stars because of the art, because young kids -- especially girls -- will love it, because parents will also be entertained, and because its wholesome message that love conquers hate has rarely been presented better. A product of its time, the film is not perfect but still tough to beat.

883008,5,6304401132,"When 'Sleeping Beauty' was first released it was the target of critical villification--perhaps because of the more stylized art work. The art work is actually a leap forward from 'Snow White' and the earlier classics. It took me awhile to get used to the new technique when I first viewed the film--but now I recognize how effectively it manages to convey the ""feel"" of a genuine fairy-tale.

A nice discussion of the art work is featured in 'The Making of Sleeping Beauty' which accompanies the latest VHS release of the film. Aside from the richly textured backgrounds and brilliant animation, 'Beauty' is blessed with the rapturous singing voice of Mary Costa's light soprano doing full justice to the ballad, 'Once Upon A Dream'. The idea of using Tchaikovsky's 'Sleeping Beauty' music for the background score and songs was an excellent decision. Music is used throughout to emphasize either the bright or darker moments in the story, always very effectively. Choral work is superb, as are the orchestrations.

This is a film that can be enjoyed on so many different levels--music, animation, story, art work--it ranks with the very best of the classic fairy-tales from Disney. And yes, Maleficent, in all of her wicked glory, makes the most impressive fire-breathing dragon you're ever likely to see!

Dear Walt gave us little gals the imagined lore of pretty Princess's or Princess's to be. As well as the Tom boy in me, the warrior Princes with sword and shield fighting for the greatest cause . . . defending ones kingdom from evil overbearing forces.

My undying luv for the winged serpents of old - Dragons, is all given credit due to my favorite Walt Disney villian  . . .
Malevolent Maleficent, considered a Dark Fairy (more suitable in Disney standards of the time than a witch) who transformed her being into the statuesque purple fire breathing dragon in the ending battle together with Prince Phillip and the delightful fairies; Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather to save the realm from darkness.

MALEVOLENT MALEFICENT, THE DARKEST FAIRY - notable quotes:
""The Forest of Thorns shall be his tomb!
Move through the skies on a fog of doom!
Now go with the curse, and serve me well!
Round Stefan's Castle, CAST MY SPELL!""

""She is indeed, most wondrous fair.
Gold of sunshine in her hair,
lips that shame the red red rose.
In ageless sleep, she finds repose.
The years roll by, but a a hundred years to a steadfast heart, are but a day.
And now, the gates of a dungeon part, and our prince is free to go his way.
Off he rides, on his noble steed, a valiant figure, straight and tall!
To wake his love with ""loves' first kiss""! And prove that ""true love"" conquers all! AHAHAHAHAHA!""

SLEEPYING BEAUTY is most intoxicating, hilariously funny, beautiful artistry, classical music and captivating characters immortalized.  Both an enchantment and fulfilling destiny, from a prickling finger to a long awaited magical kiss.

`Sleeping Beauty' stands at the end of phase I in the history of Disney's production of feature length animation films. Following such early classics like `Snow White' (37), `Alice in Wonderland' (51) and `Peter Pan' (53) and preceding the modern masterpieces `Little Mermaid' (89), 'Beauty and the Beast' (91), `Aladdin' (92), `Pocahontas' (95) and `Mulan' (98) you can easily observe both the gains in production values from the earlier and the shortcomings in comparison with those that followed.

Yes the characters are grossly undeveloped when judged by today's standards and the animation falls noticeable short of what can now be done, the colors are brilliant and alluring the three good fairies Flora, Flauna and Merryweather enchanting and the music memorable.

Whether you love it or just like this film it's a piece of Disney history and should ultimately be judged by its main target audience, children.",1175817600,2,1173,5.098958333333333
883079,5,6304401132,"Music, sound, color, and motion were what Walt Disney once said about exploring the world of animation. This movie has it all! The pure use of the classical backdrop of Sleeping Beauty Ballet embraces this animated feature with a children's book come to life in a 3D manner, when 3D was looked upon as a cinema gimmick. Don't get me wrong, it's not a 3D movie, but seeing this film on the big screen theatre, makes one feel they have entered those magic castles-firsthand.

The gimmick here is to give the three good fairies each a unique color, which they relish, even for their change into peasant women, harboring the young princess in the middle of the forest in order to shield her from the witches curse.

The witch, of course, is dark, sinister, and very gothic. Not wanting to give into failure for her announced wicked spell cast upon the young princess since birth.

During an outdoor walk, the young princess stumbles upon a male stranger, who happens to be her once betrothed, and whom she is bound to marry. Not knowing he is the prince, and him not knowing she is the princess, they both fall in love with each other amongst cute trailing animals.

The miscommunication goes further down the road as they announce their love for each other with the people who have been protecting them, and then think they have fallen for some stranger.

It's the witch who becomes the first to find out they have mistakingly bonded, and captures the prince as hostage. (For he alone can break the spell, with love's first kiss).

It's not enough that she finally set the spell upon the princess, when she finds out her hostage has been set free. Ultimately transforming herself into a raging demon, in order to thwart his advance towards the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Fine animated tale, and incredible execution style for a film developed in the late 50's.

It was re-released in the mid-1980s, and, no doubt, many of us Generation Yers, as well as people who were children when it was first released, a good thirty decades before, will recall just how beautiful a film it truly is.  For starters, the use of color to tell this oft-told tale, with great attention to detail.  Particularly, I recall the scenes that take place in the forest, when the beautiful Princess Aurora, who carries a curse on her head, bestowed on her by the evil and vindictive Malificent, is hiding away with her fairy godmothers, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather.  It's so green in these sequences that I can almost smell the earth.  What's more, Princess Aurora is drop-dead gorgeous.  It's easy to see why the jealous Malificent cursed the blonde-haired beauty at her christening.  [Yes, though most of you probably know about the plot already, for those of you who aren't familiar with it.

883175,5,6304401132,"""Sleeping Beauty"" was one of my favorite Disney animations when I was little, along with ""Alice in Wonderland"". Watched it quite a few times, and know all the words to all the songs, and pretty much all the dialogue, both of which are pretty good.

A princess, Aurora, is born, and three fairies come with gifts to give. Only two, beauty and song, are given. The sorceress Malificent interrupts the ceremony, and gives a gift of her own, a promise that when Aurora touches the spindle of a spinning wheel on her sixteenth birthday, she will die. Luckily, the third of the fairies, Merryweather, has her gift to give, and she counters the spell. If the princess does prick her finger, she will fall into sleep rather than death, and can be awoken with true love's first kiss. Still, the King is not convinced, and has every spinning wheel burnt, and the fairies take the child into the forest, to be raised as a peasant under the name of Rose. Will this be enough, or will Malificent get her way?

The animation and scenery has a medieval flavor, while the augmented Tchaikovsky score and additional songs really add to the atmosphere. The sorceress Malificent is probably my favorite Disney villain, she's a very carefully crafted character, from the crack of her staff, to her flowing robes to her soft voice. The chatter and squabbles between the good fairies is pretty interesting too, as is the discussions between the two kings. Fine characters all round, though I do feel a bit bad calling Malificent ""fine""...

Worth a look for fans of fantasy and lovers of animation.",1165881600,3,1575,4.72
883176,4,6304401132,"I'm sure we're all familiar with the story of Sleeping Beauty - the timeless classic of a beautiful princess, separated from her birth parents for 16 years in an effort to prevent her from pricking her finger and drifting into an endless sleep.  Her only cure, were this to happen would be the kiss of True Love.

Of course, this film is Disney at his best, no doubt about it, and is a joy to watch for all ages, both young and old.  It works at many levels.  The musical score, based on a famous ballet, is exquisite and charming, and the story line, is multi-leveled and quite enthralling, both to very young children and to sage adults.

It is interesting to note that Walt Disney changed this 14th Century story from a pagan tale to a Christian one.  The original story is one of rape and revenge, but Walt Disney's classic is one of triumph of Good over Evil.  I particularly love how Prince Philip is essentially impotent without the aid of the three magical faeries, Flora, Fauna and Meriwether, who obviously symbolize the Three Graces.  Without their help, he (nor any of us, is the implication), cannot succeed in the ultimate triumph over the Evil One, manifested in Malefacent, and her spell of Death, (or endless sleep - a reference perhaps to indifference to the Godliness around us?).  Also of interest is the reference to the spinning wheel itself.  In the 14th century, the art of weaving was terribly important and thus a young maiden, including a royal one, would well be judged on the quality of her weaving and spinning ability.  Additionally, the original story had her poisoned by a flax seed on the spinning wheel, and there truly is a poison carried by flax seeds.  Another example of Disney's Christian theme is the very nature of the story itself, of a child, a girl in this story, who is taken from her rightful parents for a certain length of time, but will be reunited again with them someday, presumably after her ""death"" and reuniting with her true love, a Prince of all Princes.  As I say, Sleeping Beauty, is a story to be enjoyed on many levels.

883178,5,6304401132,"It's so wonderful to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic recently for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Snow White by the time Disney released it again.

Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Sleeping Beauty, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.

The story is familiar enough to any parent, so I won't go on about that other than to say that of all the Disney Princess classics, Sleeping Beauty (and Snow White) has some scenes that might scare a young princess under the age of 5.

But you should take advantage of purchasing Sleeping Beauty or any of the other ""off-the-market"" Disney princess classics like Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess of your own that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.

And indeed, you will enjoy Sleeping Beauty or any of the other Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.

883179,5,6304401132,"This DVD changed my opinion of Disney's Sleeping Beauty.  Since the story has been summarized elsewhere, my review will focus mainly on the DVD itself.  I had never been much of a fan previously and viewed this as a sort of Snow White and Cinderella also-ran, although I did love the gorgeous, sweeping adaption of Tchaikovsky's ballet, with ""I wonder"" and especially ""Once Upon a Dream"" being among Disney's finest and most transportative musical pieces.  The difference between this and prior releases of Sleeping Beauty (indeed, of many Disney movies) is that the digital restoration truly enhances the film possibly beyond what, as one reviewer put it, may actually have been experienced by the original theatrical audience.

The results are nothing short of stunning!  At last, viewers can really see the intricate details of Eyvind Earle's brilliant animated medieval tapestries, any still of which could hang in an art gallery.  For a comparison, check out the unrestored segments on Disk 2, such as the trailers, and see how grainy and washed out those look.  Whereas, in DVD's like Bambi and Cinderella, the restoration went somewhat overboard with excessive brightness and ""dead"" backgrounds in the former, and questionable color ""improvements"" in the latter, for this release of Sleeping Beauty, Disney struck the right balance.

One note on this ""Special Edition""; that term has been used rather loosely by Disney over the years.  This 2-disk set actually contains a fair amount of extra material, including a few rarities like vintage documentaries and specials apparently found nowhere else, such that it could technically be called ""Platinum.""  While the word is that Sleeping Beauty will eventually be given a proper ""Platinum"" treatment, perhaps on Blu-Ray, that won't be for at least a few years yet.

The time and care devoted to crafting Sleeping Beauty shows. It was an elegant 70mm stereophonic visual and sonic feast that fit in well with other literally ""big"" movies of 1959, even though it nearly bankrupted the studio at the time.  Given the film's ever-increasing stature within the Disney canon, particularly its acknowledged influence on anime, I would especially like to see a theatrical re-release, with further sound enhancements, as I believe it would play well in modern cinemas.  The sheer spectacle and escapism of Sleeping Beauty outweighs whatever shortcomings have existed in terms of character development.  (For the record, aside from the three fairies who take up the most screen time but are less irritating than Cinderella's rodentia, 1. Aurora is every bit as appealing as Snow White or Cinderella, 2. Disney finally managed to create a believable prince in Phillip, and 3. Maleficent is an awesome villainess who can transform herself into a scary dragon and doesn't need any magic mirror to tell her what to do!)  The bottom line is, if you are a fan of classic animation, epic fairytales, or the grandeur of Tchaikovsky, Sleeping Beauty is a must.

For these reasons, I heartily recommend Sleeping Beauty Special Edition.",1157846400,4,3069,5.182186234817814

If you're thinking of buying this, though, get this for the extras: all are dated and easily recall the era of the late 50's that the movie was released in. ""4 Artists Paint 1 Tree"" and ""The Peter Tchaikovsky Story"" are especially enjoyable and add another dimension to the viewing of the film.

The commentary, on the other hand, is nothing special.  Yes, there are a couple of songs thrown in that got cut out of the final production.  But there is also quite a bit of buttering up of the final production as well as of Walt Disney himself.  The commentary is also almost completely disembodied from the film itself - it sounds like they carried out separate interviews with those involved on a few major topics (background art, overall design, Walt Disney) and simply rearranged clips with the voice of a narrator, while in large part ignoring the action of the film.

883315,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is a Motion Picture that has a true Masterpiece aura. This Film was such a Masterpiece that it also would influence other Films and other types of Animation. The Paintings in Sleeping Beauty were of a true master who is no longer with us, when as for the graphic Paintings of Melicifent and her as a Dragon, and as for the Castle that she lived in, as well as the Thorns that defended Aurora's Castle, they are so amazing, that they would all influence any Gothic Painter today.
In a variety of songs by Ronnie James Dio or even KISS and JUDAS PRIEST plus OZZY himself, one can feel a presence of Sleeping Beauty. In the album Dream Evil that I did a review on, this Film gives a huge presence of influence, and especially on the album Cover, when as for OZZy and his albums, one can feel some type of influence on Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon as well as Ultimate Sin. On the album of Music From THE ELDER and on the PAUL STANLEY album, one can find influences from the Battle in between GOOD and EVIL, that are in the Film of Sleeping Beauty, although the music is of the original Ballet, but redesigned for the Film, so the music and the Tale are in no connection with Music From THE ELDER or PAUL STANLEY.
Although there is no connections at all with this album and the Film, I always felt a connection in between Sleeping Beauty and Calling All Stations by Genesis. The swirls of the art on the CD jacket and the multi colors shown when the Gifts are given to Aurora are to blaime, while the Battle sceenes in between Melificent and Philip as well as the sceenes of the escape, are in connection some how for me with the song and musical sounds on CONGO, which is my favorate song on this over ignored Masterpiece. The title song gives me a feel of lonleyness, when dealing with Aurora being drawn into such a long sleep, while Shipwrecked is to me about the heartbreak in between Briar Rose learning that she has always lived a lie and that she will never see her true love again.
One can take these ideas seriously or leave them alone, but this Film has such a strong connection to various Pop icons, if one follows those songs and certain parts of the Tale of Sleeping Beauty, as well as the Art.",1146009600,2,2229,4.309523809523809

883318,5,6304401132,"I won't waste your time discussing the movie, it's gorgeous graphic design, and the beautiful music, adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet. If you're a fan, you already know this. If you've not yet discovered the movie, you'll read more about it from others. Note: This is a review of the DVD edition. I don't own a high definition TV or a Blu-Ray player, so I haven't bothered to buy the Blu-Ray edition.

Sleeping Beauty was first released to DVD in region 1 in the fall of 2003, although it had already been released in other parts of the world. This release utilized a 1990's digital restoration that was absolutely gorgeous and presented the film in both its original widescreen Cinemascope aspect ratio and pan-and-scan fullscreen. It also included a disc full of bonus materials, such as the 15-minute making-of featurette from the 1997 VHS and laserdisc editions, other short making-of featurettes, a widescreen-to-fullscreen comparison, and several short films such as Grand Canyon, the live-action Cinemascope short that accompanied Sleeping Beauty in its original 1950 theatrical release. For a non-Platinum Edition, Sleeping Beauty's first DVD release was definitely one worthy of a Disney classic. However, its release window was very short and it was vaulted just five months after its DVD debut.

Now, Sleeping Beauty has been taken out of the Disney vault and given a sparkling new DVD treatment, starting with the main feature itself. Sleeping Beauty was the second film in history to be given a full extensive digital restoration, and those efforts resulted in what I still consider to be one of the finest DVD transfers ever made. However, this new restoration blows the 2003 DVD's transfer away. The colors are warmer and more pleasing this time. The clarity is outstanding and all of the patterns and textures feel almost as if you could touch it.

Disney has been advertising this as a never-before-seen expanded version of the film, and they're right. Now, anyone who's seen it in a theater or on a widescreen home video release knows the film has always been wide, and therefore knows the expansion shown on the packaging and in commercials is a little exaggerated. However, previous widescreen versions used the Cinemascope master, which cropped a bit off all four sides of the images. Sleeping Beauty, however, was filmed in and designed for 70MM Technirama. However, once a soundtrack is added to a theatrical print, you STILL didn't see all of the full Technirama negative. This new DVD and Blu-Ray edition is the first ever home video version to utilize the complete Technirama negative. Although you won't always notice the difference, there's some scenes where you see things you never EVER saw in previous home video releases. In a film that places so much emphasis on the artwork, this is quite a revelation. This DVD, unlike the previous one, does NOT include a pan-and-scan version. Personally, I'm not very upset over this, as Sleeping Beauty should only be seen in its full Technirama splendor.

In addition, the audio transfer is absolutely flawless, but the last DVD, as well as the soundtrack CD, which has also seen a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/new-release/dp/B001DXF9FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">new release</a>&nbsp;to coincide with the Platinum Edition DVD/Blu-Ray, also had amazing sound quality - very vibrant and full with complete clarity. I've heard recordings made AFTER this soundtrack was recorded that don't sound this good. Sleeping Beauty was not the first stereo album, nor was it the first film to have stereo sound, but it was the first time the music element itself had ever been recorded in multi-channel stereo, and therefore became the world's first stereo soundtrack album. This time, the DVD also includes the restored original 4-channel soundtrack as well. This one sounds a little less full, but its inclusion in here for posterity's sake is still to be commended. I've also heard that the 7.1 soundtrack from the Blu-Ray is also absolutely incredible.

The bonus features on this new set are, for the most part, far better than those from the previous DVD, with one exception, which I'll get to in a bit.

First and foremost, the audio commentary from the original DVD is gone and replaced with a new one, although clips from the old one are said to be included. I have yet to listen to the new commentary, so I can't say anything. The old commentary included two deleted song demos, but since these are included on disc 2 as separate bonus features, this really probably isn't missed. Nonetheless, it's a good reason to hang onto your 2003 DVD. Another good reason will be coming up soon.

Secondly, gone is the fluffy 15-minute EPK featurette from the movie's 1997 home video releases, plus other various small featurettes obviously taken from interviews for the 15-minute piece. While all of it was informative and better than no behind-the-scenes stuff at all, it left one wanting more. Well, Disney's giving us more now with a fairly meaty 45-minute documentary, Picture Perfect: The Making Of Sleeping Beauty. This one really delves into the history of Disney's film adaptation, as well as the groundbreaking achievements accomplished in the film. The only EPK spin-off featurette from the 2003 DVD one might miss is the Restoration featurette, but since it advertised how the master for the 1997 video and the 2003 video releases was done, it's not too logical here, but it was nicely informative on how digital restoration is done in general.

Disney includes the Cinemascope-filmed short film that accompanied the film on its original release, Grand Canyon, as well as the Disneyland episode promoting the film, The Peter Tchaikovsky Story. Although these were included on the 2003 DVD release, these are not merely ported over from that release. Grand Canyon was ported over onto the 2003 DVD from Sleeping Beauty's special edition laserdisc box set's non-anamorphic masters, meaning it was a letterboxed 4:3 image. This time, the film has been beautifully restored and is presented letterboxed in a 16:9 frame. In addition, The Peter Tchaikovsky Story is presented in its complete television versions. One version explains to the viewer how to use their radios and TVs to be able to view the program in 3-channel stereo sound and was shown in markets with participating radio stations broadcasting the audio. The second version, shown in non-participating markets, had different narration during that segment. Both versions, however, included TV's first ever widescreen presentations, albeit still slightly cropped on the sides, when they previewed clips of Sleeping Beauty.

New featurettes on Eyvind Earle and Aurora's walk through the forest, called Sequence 8, are also included, as are live-action reference footage - some of which was ported over from the 2003 release, some of which is new to the set - and the short film Four Artists Paint One Tree - also ported from the 2003 release, albeit from what I hear, a new transfer was made. Also included is an alternate opening with a new recording of the deleted song Holiday, as well as three deleted songs - It Happens I Have A Picture, presented as both a newly recorded song and in a spoken word version, as well as the two demos from the 2003 DVD's commentary - Riddle Diddle and Go To Sleep. All are presented with storyboards with the exception of Go To Sleep, which is actually married to the scene of the film it would have appeared in.

The most exciting new bonus, however, is the recreation of the original Sleeping Beauty Castle attraction at Disneyland. Bonus features of this type have been included on The Little Mermaid Platinum Edition DVD, which offered a virtual ride based on the abandoned Disneyworld ride, and the recent 2-Disc Nightmare Before Christmas DVD, where film of the Christmastime revamp of the Haunted Mansion was presented. This time, the viewer gets the chance to view an attraction that hasn't been seen in three decades. You can see the attraction straight-through, in a presentation that allows you to see the windows up close and get more information on how they were originally created, and a behind-the-scenes featurette on the making and history of the attraction. When any of the presentations are over and it goes back to this bonus feature's main menu, you'll see a little something highlighted. Select it and you can see still images of the pages from the souvenir book given to visitors of the attraction at the end.

The only bonus feature not completely ported over from the previous DVD are the art galleries. In some areas, it gains images, but in some it loses them. However, it's presented in the same format as galleries from all of the post-Beauty and the Beast Platinum Edition DVDs. Also, audio commentary has been dropped from all images. I personally preferred the art gallery in a castle format of the 2003 DVD's galleries as well as the audio commentary on select images, which is another reason I'll be hanging onto my 2003 DVD as well.

Despite what's been left off from the 2003 release, this new 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Sleeping Beauty STILL blows that DVD away because of what IS here, as well as the spectacular audio and video presentation. Without a doubt it is the best home video version ever for this fantastic movie. All fans of this movie MUST own this new DVD edition. If you happen to own the 2003 DVD, you still must upgrade to this new Platinum Edition DVD, but I'd still hang onto the original DVD for the fullscreen version, (In case you ever had to show this to someone who *gag* hates widescreen.) the original audio commentary, and the original photo galleries. Disney's first Platinum Edition of a previously-strong DVD release, based on some past downgrades, could have been a complete disaster. Instead, it's a vast improvement and I can't praise this set enough.",1138579200,2,9942,5.033414337788578
883319,5,6304401132,"First of all, this comes in Widescreen or Fullscreen. You chose when you hit play.  This was the first animated film to be made in 2.35 aspect ratio.

Aurora is the first child of the king and queen.  There is a royal baby shower and everyone is invited except the evil witch Maleficent.  The first two fairies give Aurora her gifts when Maleficent arrives and gives Aurora her gift, ""She will prick her finger on a spindle and die.""  As Maleficent has the strongest magic, the final fairy, Merryweather, cannot change it but modifies it to she will sleep until awaken by true love's kiss.

To prevent this from coming true, the king burns all spinning wheels and sends Aurora to be raised by the fairies in the forest.  Aurora grows up as Briar Rose and just before her 16th birthday she meets a gallant stranger in the forest.  Thinking it is safe, Aurora goes home and there is a big party for her.  Maleficent fulfills her curse.  To spare the kingdom the loss, the fairies cast a spell across the entire land putting everyone to sleep until Aurora awakens.

As it turns out, the man in forest is Prince Philip, Aurora's betrothed.  And it is his kiss will wake her up.

This is a beautiful classical Disney animated film.  The colors are vibrant and the widescreen gives the film extra depth.  Add in another great song score including Once Upon a Dream, and you have a true classic.

883462,5,6304401132,"In 1987, as a wide-eyed 6-year-old, I saw SLEEPING BEAUTY during it's cinema re-release.  It was probably the first time I ever went to the movies.  The experience definitely stayed with me and fired my love of Disney movies which had begun when I was a toddler with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and MARY POPPINS on video.  Now so many years later I have relished collecting and revisiting all the Disney classics on DVD, and the 2-disc edition of SLEEPING BEAUTY is something really special.  Six years in the making, the movie made history for being the first animated feature shot in 70mm and was the 2nd highest-grossing film of the 1960s' (second only to BEN-HUR).

The story is well-known: Beautiful Princess Aurora is cursed as a baby by the cruel Maleficent.  On her 16th birthday she'll die from pricking her finger on a spindle.  Good fairy Merryweather remedies the curse by changing death to sleep, and the awakening of Aurora by the kiss of true love.  However, to ensure that Aurora does not meet this fate at all, the fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather take the infant deep into the forest, where they pose as three spinsters and rename the child Briar Rose.  On her 16th birthday the girl will be quietly smuggled back to the palace with Maleficent none-the-wiser.  However things take an unexpected turn when Briar Rose falls in love with a handsome Prince, and the princess is ultimately discovered despite the best efforts of the fairies'.

The production design by Eyvind Earl takes it's cue from medieval tapestries and paintings.  The score, freely-adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet, is lush with ""Once Upon a Dream"" and ""I Wonder"" the main standouts.  Mary Costa, later one of the leading opera singers of the 60s' and 70s', performs the role of Aurora/Briar Rose and does a fantastic job.  The character of Prince Phillip (voiced by Bill Shirley) is the first prince in a Disney fairytale that takes an active role in the story.  The prince-roles in SNOW WHITE and CINDERELLA are quite static and uninteresting.  Eleanor Audley (who also memorably voiced CINDERELLA's icy stepmother Lady Tremaine) works her magic again with Maleficent, still one of Disney's strongest villains.  Verna Felton, Vera Vague and Barbara Luddy play Flora, Fauna and Merryweather.  Disney fans will remember Felton from CINDERELLA (the Fairy Godmother), ALICE IN WONDERLAND (the Queen of Hearts) and LADY AND THE TRAMP (Aunt Sarah).  Barbara Luddy's voice you'll also remember as that of Lady in LADY AND THE TRAMP.

Disney has done a terrific job in restoring SLEEPING BEAUTY for this 2-disc Special Edition.  The film is presented in its  Technirama 70mm proportions with 5.1 sound mix (as well as an optional DTS mix).  The colours are strong and vibrant with the use of High Definition Video employed to clean up every frame of animation.  Some great extras are included, featuring a 'Making Of' segment with Mary Costa and Eyvind Earl both extensively interviewed.  There's also a recreation of the original Disneyland 'Sleeping Beauty Walk-Through attraction' which features early concept art by Earl.  The lovely Disney cinema featurette THE PETER TCHAIKOVSKY STORY is also included along with a cute set-top adventure game 'Rescue Aurora', plus lots more.",1122336000,8,3259,5.0335820895522385

In an attempt to shield her from this curse, the three comedy fairies take the child into their care and nature her into adulthood.

Whether you're a Disney lover or not, Sleeping Beauty's mixture of strong visual characters, exciting villains and breathtaking action allow us to once again get swept away with the childhood fantasy that sadly is lacking in so many of today's more modern animated features.

883469,5,6304401132,"Surely I'm biased - as a youg kid, I dreamed of becoming a Disney animator (sadly unfulfilled) - but I believe 'Sleeping Beauty' has the most incredible art and music of all of Disney's efforts to date.  I rent other Disney DVDs from local library for my kids, but this one I bought.  Unlike the 'Lion King' special edition - which I found not-so-special - this one is truly well-done and worth a purchase.

Positives:

- High-quality digital restoration resulted in eye-popping color and details presented in 70mm widescreen format.

- Tchaikovsky's music is timeless in its power to mesmerize, and matched up perfectly with synchronized masterful animation.

- The supplemental second disc is unusually excellent both in breadth of content and the quality of presentation.

- There's a restrained, formal quality to 'Sleeping Beauty', akin to classical ballet, which provides a such pleasant contrast to the increasingly shrill Disney offerings of the late Eisner era.

- The painstakingly hand-drawn background and characters are simply awe-inspiring in their unique artistry.

- The sheer grace and elegance of the characters, as well as the consummate artistic skills of their rendering have NOT been matched by any other Disney films, generally as good as they are.  (I was disappointed by the comparatively amateurish art of 'Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and the Beast'.  It was not until 'Finding Nemo' that artistic animation again made my jaw drop and stay there throughout the film.)

Negatives:

- This work was done almost half century ago, and the age does show in this time of computerized animation.  The most noticeable flaw is when Malicifent first appears literally with a bang, yet the characters in the background remain absolutely still.  This detracts from the power of this moment; rationality dictates that such an apparition would have caused shock and panic among the crowd.  Contrast this with the animated crowd scenes in 'Hunchback of Notre Dame', or the constantly dynamic background of 'Bug's Life', in which every blade of grass sways with the wind.

- The classical elegance of the story and characters means certain dignity and restraint (contrast this with the gross-out jokes of 'Lion King' and endless wisecracking of 'Aladdin').  In my opinion, this is a major plus, since this would make  'Sleeping Beauty' a true classic (like the best works of DaVinci and Michaelangelo) that will survive the test of time for decades to come.  However, in today's world where attention-deficit rules, its lack of cloying cuteness and 'Fear Factor' gross-outs may not win this film a general popularity contest.",1098230400,4,2635,5.155294117647059
883470,5,6304401132,"SLEEPING BEAUTY is a beautifully made film.  It takes the grace of the ballet and shows it in a form that makes it easy to watch, easy to listen to and easy to own.  This is the story of the Princess Aurora, cursed by an evil witch upon her first royal event.  In an effort to save the Princess from her fate, the three good fairies (also excellently done as comic relief) raise her deep in the forest without the use of magic to help them out.  Upon her 16th birthday, Aurora is told the truth of her past and the tale takes off from there.  While I'm sure that most of you have already seen this wonderful film, I will not spoil any more of the details of the movie.

The singing in this is truly amazing.  The girl voicing Aurora is a beautiful, clear soprano, hitting notes that amazed me as a child and still amaze me today.  Prince Phillip is all a prince should be.  Malificient is truly the most wicked villan ever put on a Disney screen.  She still gives me some chills into my adulthood.

I highly recommend SLEEPING BEAUTY, not just for your children, but for you as well.",1097884800,3,1083,4.234146341463415
883557,5,6304401132,"I always used to call Sleeping Beauty an updated re-telling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Princess Aurora has a magnificent voice who dreams of her prince and who has many animal friends. Prince overhears her and joins in but she gets frightened and runs off. Instead of 7 distinct dwarves, you get a shortened 3 distinct fairies. Maleficent turns into a dragon while the Queen turns into an old hag. Aurora and Snow White are put into a coma by doing something that the villain has made them do(bite the poisoned apple/prick the needle). But I greatly prefer this and even without the Snow White comparison, I still call it a classic.

On Aurora's birth, the entire townsfolk descends on the castle to see. 3 fairies: Flora, Fauna and Merryweather give their gifts beauty and song. But before Merryweather gives hers, Maleficent shows up and is upset she wasn't invited. In response, she casts a spell that Aurora will prick her finger on a needle before sundown on her 16th birthday and die. Merryweather than casts a spell that instead of death, it's more of a coma that can be broken if she receives true love's first kiss.

Aurora, re-named Briar Rose, is now living with the 3 fairies in a cottage in the forest. While out, she encounters Prince Phillip and says for him to meet her that night. However, she gets upset and runs off. They re-enter the castle but Maleficent puts her in a trance that makes her prick her finger and on top of that, Phillip is captured. The fairies break in her castle where Phillip must get to the castle while battling Maleficent's spells, including herself.

Now I don't know about you, but when Maleficent turns into a dragon, it's still seems frightening even after all these years. ""Now you must deal with me O Prince, and all the powers of HELL!"" and she rises high in the air to become a dragon is still probably the better final battles Disney has done, which I would include with the one in Lion King and Little Mermaid.

It's also a really beautiful film that was shot for the first time in widescreen which required more detailed drawings and a very pristine transfer. 1 of 2 Disney films I'm recommending one after another(the other, ironically being Snow White).",1095638400,3,2219,4.638676844783715

The script, so to speak, is laughable and way below Disney's norm.

The artwork is terribly disappointing. Worse than CGI graphics today. Everything two-dimensional and static - like watching bad reruns of Clutch Cargo cartoons. Even the backgrounds lack depth and interest.

Yes, there are colorful displays of fireworks, at times. An easy feat to accomplish.

883562,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is one of the most ambitious animated films ever made. It's a gorgeous, elegant, and absolutely amazing landmark in animation; a film so charming, memorable, and beautiful that it has been hailed as the most incomparable film in the animated genre, and with good reason. Detailed backgrounds, glorious colors, outstanding visuals and beautiful music are all contributing factors to the grandeur pageantry that ""Sleeping Beauty"" enthralls on its audience.
Up until the last few years, ""Sleeping Beauty"" was actually considered one of the few Disney 'failures.' That means, a poor box-office success. But that was 1959. Since then, the film, like ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia,"" has returned to theaters many times and made way on video for new generations to enjoy, earning large estimates of money and critical praise, not to mention being the most requested Disney film on video after ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"" and ""The Lion King.""
It was finally re-released in a fantastic Special Edition DVD, and looking back, I can't believe this was once considered a failure. As if! This is not just a timeless tale of good and evil; the plot is elegantly portrayed with rich textures and stunning animation.
Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's best animated films, EVER, and a must-own DVD for any collection. If only Disney still made films like this. I don't think we could be so lucky. Don't delay, get this before time runs out!!!",1087862400,5,1444,5.046025104602511
883563,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is Disney's retelling of the fairy tale of the same name.  This DVD release of Disney's 75 minute movie features options to view it in either the original 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, or in a ""pan and scan"" 1.33:1 aspect ratio version that captures most of the action while using the full height of a standard television screen.  A second DVD includes supplemental material on the history and making of the film.
The story itself departs somewhat from the traditional fairy tale version, with a story line that provides a little more scope for character exposition and interaction.  The result still retains a fairy tale feel, and the plot remains simpler than most of Disney's other animated features.
The biggest strengths of the movie are in its wonderful animation, artwork, and music.
The animation is perhaps the best of any Disney movie.  The animators were exceptionally good at using facial expressions to help tell the story - Maleficent's face perfectly expresses her smug satisfaction when something goes her way, and Princess Aurora's expression when she first meets Prince Phillip by surprise perfectly communicates the various emotions that are running through her.  The animation of the action is also wonderful, with some of the best moments being Aurora's dancing and Phillip's battle with the dragon.
The background artwork is terrific.  Each background is really a high quality painting, full of scene specific detail and yet all coordinating to give the picture overall artistic unity and medieval feel.  And yet, all this beautiful background coordinates with the characters in a way that avoids overpowering them.
Unlike some of Disney's other animated classics, this film did not use original music, but instead wisely went with Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet music.  Tchaikovsky's beautiful classic music perfectly complements the beautiful, artistic nature of everything else in the film.
All the attention to artistry and detail made the film too expensive to be a commercial success in 1959, but it also made the film a timeless classic that can continue to be enjoyed today and far into the future.  Get it now, or you may have to wait seven years for Disney's next rerelease.",1085356800,6,2230,5.1722222222222225
883564,5,6304401132,"One of Disney's best animated films has to be Sleeping Beauty.  The story of Princess Aurora who is taken away from the kingdom by the three good fairies in order to protect her from the curse of the wicked fairy Maleficent.  The film looks just like a medieval tapestry and the scenery is amazing.  Disney's Sleeping Beauty has some of the best animation ever seen on film.
It is wonderful that Disney has been releasing these restored versions on DVD of their classic films and adding some wonderful documentaries and behind the scenes.
Sleeping Beauty contains some of the most widely recognized Disney characters: Princess Aurora(Briar Rose), The three good fairies Fauna, Flora and Merryweather and the most notoriously diabolical villain Maleficent.
While being an animated film, that doesn't make it any less thrilling, suspensful or exciting.  I recommend seeing this movie just to see Maleficent.  She appears in flames at Aurora's christening and she goes out with a bang as a ferocious fire breathing dragon.  This movie is truly an epic in every sense of the word: from the wicked fairy's curse, to the princess hiding out in a cottage with the three good fairies, to the princess meeting her fate atop the castle to Prince philip slaying the dragon and running up the stairs to find the Sleeping Beauty. This is one film that both adult and child can truly enjoy.

The colors are brilliant and clear.... the blue is sky blue and the pink is true rose pink.... and every color has the subtile shades that they should have... obviously reproduced from the exsisting cells and background art in the Disney archives. The additional features are plentiful and fun, and the menus are consistant with the look of the film. There is a game section that uses rock and roll music for an intro and there is a modern interpretation of the main song by a pop group, but these are very minor concessions to modern maids..... on the whole, this is an incredible 2 disc package for anyone who loves the painstaking and time consuming art that these pre-computer animations now use.
There are several short subjects, including a biography of Tchaikovsky, ""Four Artists Paint a Tree"" and ""Grand Canyon"" which are all pluses and fun to see and take us back to 1959.

The characters are wonderful, and the evil fairy Malificent is one of the most creative and evil of all the Disney villains.  The music is very good and addictive and it whisks you away to another world.  It is a once upon a dream.  See it if you love Disney films.",1084060800,2,607,4.626168224299065

Althought the animation is done by hand and not by the newest digital technology(by computer), it looks a little dated compared to some of the newer animation movies released by Disney.  Like other Disney classics released on DVD, they have remastered the film and made the colors vivid. You can also chose what format you want to watch the film in either full or wide screen.  Not to mention added lots of bonus materials including some about the making and design of the movie, which should be interesting to adults that have seen this movie during their childhood.  Also there are a couple of games included on the DVD which are good if your children are old enough to play on the computer(my daughter is only 6 months so she is not quite ready for those).  Another interesting feature found on the DVD is about the music, if it sounds formiliar that is because it was written by composer Peter Tchaikovsky, Disney only added lyrics to the music scores of the ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet.
The story is excellent, one for the ages.  The only thing that I have caution about is that if you have younger children I would think twice about showing them this movie, speaking from personal exprience, when I first saw this movie at the age of five our six I was very scared when the wicked fairy Maleficent transformed into a fire breathing dragon. I really don't plan on showing my daughter this movie until see gets much older, being only a baby now I don't think will have much interest in it now anyway.

Certainly, the much-acclaimed artistic merits of ""Sleeping Beauty"" come to life here in a form that may actually surpass its original theatrical presentation. But the stunning visuals serve to enhance what is possibly Disney's most accomplished narrative. The subtle character touches and combination of drama, humor, romance and adventure play out in wonderful balance, all leading to an exciting climax that has often been copied in several subsequent Disney films...but never to the same effect. The story takes place within a completely convincing fantasy world, giving a real sense of time and place for the characters - and viewers - to inhabit. Children will never forget the warm and lovely princess, her charmingly realistic young prince, and the greatest villain in Disney animation. Adults will be caught up in a nicely paced story that unfolds with just the right mix of fantasy and magic.
""Sleeping Beauty""'s story and art touched me as a child, and the film continues to amaze and transport me today. The multiple galleries of production and concept art present a fine display of the substantial talent and imagination the went into the making of this elegant and elaborate film.

Sleeping Beauty (in case you didn't know) is a story about Aurora, a princess, who, on the day she was to be given special gifts by her fairy godparents, she was cursed by an especially evil fairy. The curse was that on her 16th birthday, she would prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die. So, she gets taken away by her fairy godmothers and hidden in a small cottage in the forest, not told of her royal heritage. Everything is all fine and dandy until the day of her sixteenth birthday, when she meets a boy in the woods (who just happens to be her betrothed, though she doesn't know it) and her fairy godmothers give her a magical (which they REALLY weren't supposed to do) dress and cake. A spy for the evil fairy sees the magic, then the princess, and tells her, so Aurora actually ends up pricking her finger.
But, everything turns out fine and dandy, and everyone lives happily ever after.
Recommmended for: EVERYONE. Everyone loves this movie (for the most part), even if they won't admit it.",1069977600,3,1218,4.566210045662101
883706,5,6304401132,"I vividly remember the release of Sleeping Beauty. I was old enough to go see it myself - just barely.  There I was sitting way up front eating my popcorn and all of a sudden this spectacular dragon materialized right before my eyes.  Popcorn forgotten, I was hooked.  Cartoons never looked the same to me, and I spent the rest of my life inhaling fantasy and science fiction on a quest for the same thrill.
Animation has changed quite a bit in the ensuing years, but even today Sleeping Beauty is a towering achievement.  Now I'm more sensitive to the tricks of the art and can see the masterful use of perspective that made the scenes leap out at you.  When I first picked up this DVD I half expected to be disappointed, to find it really wasn't so glorious in retrospect.  This is hardly the case - this film is just as vibrant and alive as it was in 1959.
The added dimension now is that I can see how Disney's work was a formative influence on animation even today.  Artist/Directors like Miyazaki owe much to this film and its predecessor Snow White.  And they freely admit it.  As a production, Sleeping Beauty created a sense of legitimacy for animation that proved that high quality animation was something well beyond the Saturday morning funnies.
Disney took a great risk when creating this film, pouring a tremendous amount of resources in making it something as perfect as was possible for his time.  While the studio reaped the financial benefits, the audience was the real winner, as a whole genre exploded before our eyes.  Even now, with anime rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, this film stands out for story, art, and music.
The additional features, especially those that retell the making of the film, are excellent as well.  All captures in fine detail on this DVD.  This is a must see for anyone who still loves a fairy tale.",1069804800,205,1858,4.577039274924472
883707,5,6304401132,"Between the classic Armitage backdrops and the beautiful animation (it's hard to explain to kids today that Maleficent was drawn BY HAND, not in a computer, a'la Pixar) this ranks among the most intricate animated films ever made.
This film is from an era when feats of animation were displayed without apology- the flames licking the vine that envelopes Sleeping Beauty's castle, for example(and really, the vine itself) are testament to a bygone time when stunning visual effects were all the more stunning for having come from a real hand, a real paintbrush, liquid ink.
The story itself is a departure, in classic Disney style, from the original Sleeping Beauty stories from cross-cultural folklore.  Disney implements such characters as the fairies, the bumbling King Hubert, anthropomorphic animals (always) and the greatest villian of all time- Maleficent.  These characters mesh with the sheer animation artistry to raise this bedtime story from the context of simple narrative to the epic romantic accomplishment of the type Disney is known for.
While we all, of course, anticipate the happy ending, the wedding, the classic Disney optimism, this one is worth looking at not only as an archetypical fairy tale, but also as an exemplar of mid-century animated art.",1069632000,5,1272,5.230392156862745

883710,2,6304401132,"I remember seeing this film in the theater, not sure what year.  It was the habit of Disney to show their films in rotation, one year Sleeping Beauty, another Bambi, another Snow White, Fantasia, Alice In Wonderland, and so on.  This was before the age of VCR's.  When I saw it I was very small.  Maleficent, the evil witch that put a curse on Aurora, frightened me, as she did when she became the gigantic fire-breathing dragon.  I had a few nightmares about this film.
I would caution parents with very small children to watch the tape first without the child present to see if these images are appropriate for their child.  At times, Disney was a bit too over-the-top in the earlier classic cartoons when it came to violence and death and I can recall a few other films he made where the images were too much for me to understand and frightened me instead.  I remembering being very upset when Bambi's mother was shot dead, crying through a good portion of the rest of the film. When I saw Snow White's stepmother turn into the wicked old hag I could no longer look at the screen and wanted to leave the theater.
Disney's company was even responsible for a horrible cartoon called ""Hitler's Children"" that was made during WWII, I believe as propaganda.  (I was able to view this cartoon recently and was appalled at the images and language!)  So, even though these old cartoon films are called ""classics"" parents should take the time to view them before their children do and spare their children some unhappy moments.  I wish my parent had had the same option.
The rest of the film tells a good story and the art is visually interesting despite being so old.  I give this film 2 1/2 stars",1068163200,11,1692,4.5147540983606556

I thought that Aurora's voice is a bit too womanly for her, certainly very different from the singing voices of the other princesses. And I know this is going to sound strange, but it just felt to me that Aurora and Phillip's relationship wasn't very developed. I mean, it's a Disney...but at least the other movies had more interaction between the characters, even though it was love at first sight. In this respect, Sleeping Beauty falls in with Snow White and Cinderella.
But overall, the movie was very entertaining...I loved the scene between King Stephen and Phillip's father, when they were drunk. And the three fairies are so adorable! I didn't realize till I watched this again that Maleficent also had a sense of humor when she captured the prince and told him that he would be released in a 100 years.

The story, you should know by now of course, young princess whisked away by three fairy `godmothers' to protect her from evil sorceress, raised in the forest unaware of her heritage, meets prince charming unaware he's a prince, eventually finds out they're betrothed to each other as prince fights sorceress.  The re-mastering technique employed on this DVD yielded incredible results, the image was actually more vibrant and colorful than originally aired in 1959 and it looks marvelous on today's widescreen HDTVs.  I was quite taken with the art, quite unlike anything Disney has done before or since with it's angular geometry and perpendicular themes.  Aurora and Maleficent duel for most beautiful Disney female forms to date.  The extras on the DVD are quite interesting as well.  The original theatrical companion pieces The Grand Canyon was sublime and the snippet of how four artists paint a tree helped glean a bit into the mindset of the brilliant artists on the Sleeping Beauty project.

883794,5,6304401132,"In the fifties Disney embarked on a creative and artistic endeavour of unprecedented scale.  Adapting the old folk tale of Briar Rose for a more recent generation, Walt Disney was determined to make this his swan song - his crowning achievement.  Millions of dollars and more than 5 years was spent creating this lavish work of art.
And the film was successful, to a degree.  Although not among the very highest grossing films of its year, it pulled in a respectable amount, and later more than made it's creation cost on video.  However, seeing that Sleeping Beauty did not have the success that they were hoping for, Disney decided to not attempt such lavishness again, a tradition which has only been broken with recently.
But what of the film, is it worthwhile?  The answer is yes - the timeless setting has created a film that is impenetrable to aging.  It retains its humor, and the plot maintains an excellent balance of simplicity combined with challenge and confusion.  The characters are all voiced beautifully, and each fit their purpose in the story perfectly.  In addition to this, now that the film is on dvd, it can be seen as it was meant to be - in glorious widescreen.  When you see the effect the widescreen has on opening up the framing and shaking of the claustrophobic atmosphere the movie had in it's pan and scan format, you'll vow never to go back.
It is worth noting that this is Disney's most humanist work.  The movements of the characters are so natural and lifelike, and their motivations so uncluttered and benign, that it is impossible to wish them anything but happiness.  The romance between Aurora and Phillip has been derided for being too simplistic, too sappy, too unrealistic, but those who do not seem to understand that this is what works for such simple people.  Phillip is the ultimate good guy, while Aurora is the ultimate good girl.  When they interact, everything feels natural, everything feels right.  There is much to their romance than a simple list of adjectives.",1064361600,,2015,4.769452449567724
883795,4,6304401132,"Highly recommended to those who want to see background art at its zenith.  Taking one aspect at a time: 1) COLOR: Incredible!  The same dark intensity I remember from the 70mm prints.  One reviewer said the DVD color blew away the original theatrical print he saw when the film was first released.  He may have seen a 35mm print back then, because the original 70mm print I saw in 1959 was about equivalent to this DVD, but, in the theatre, the image on the retinas if all viewers in the 20 or so rows nearest the screen was much bigger -- bigger than is currently possible, while maintaining sharpness, with any home equipment.  70mm in those days was projected on a very large screen with at least some curve, and was meant to simulate the arc of vision.  In Sleeping Beauty, the effect seemed like being immersed in a dream-like, ornate, medieval world. That the color in the DVD is equivalent to the 70mm, the first DVD I can say that about, means that the restorers and transferors are to be heartily congratulated!  The marvelous color styling of Eyvend Earl comes through in all of its carefully thought out detail. There is a marvelous, rich, often dark look. There is a wider range of colors, and more variegated backgrounds, both drawn and suggested, than usual, by far. The story I heard a few years after the film was released, during a visit to the Disney studio (as a college newspaper writer) was that Disney had asked Earl (and the other background artists) for ""A moving Illustration; a medieval tapestry come to life."" ""But Walt, medieval tapestries had muted colors!"" ""But Eyvend, ours won't!""  Disney, Earl, and the others later decided to go for dark, rich images, and to imitate the fancier and more colorful style of the rubrics.  While it would not be appropriate for many other films, this color is the best of the best.
2) SOUND. They toned down the dynamics, and shaved off the deep bass!  Try turning the Bass control way up, and crank up the subwoofer, if it has a separate control.  If you have seen the film before, ask other viewers to step out of the room for a moment, and go to one of the scenes with thunder, or the climax, and make sure there is enough bass -- then go to another spot and check to see if the quiet and delicate treble music is still clear.  The escape from the castle and the events immediately following should be overwhelming, and Tchaikovsky's mad, wild, frenzied string music -- particularly the ""Dance Vertigo"" part of the Sleeping Beauty Ballet that they used for the thorns catching on fire, and just about the whole climactic sequence (as the prince tries to get to Aroura's castle), should really rage, and shake the floor. It did in the theater in 70mm and 6 channel stereo, and it did at my house, when I got through with it. Manufacturers often slice bass and dynamics in DVDs of films that had spectacular sound, to avoid blowing out the feeble speakers people have in their TV sets. They should either offer special ""full dynamics"" DVDs for those who are equipped, or just risk it.
3) THE FILM AS A WHOLE : Using Goethe's Three Principles: a) ""What was the artist trying to do?"" Probably trying to make a more elaborate and beautiful than usual Disney fairy tale film. b) ""How well has the artist done that?"" Very well indeed, in most ways. Much of the archetypal depth of such tales is intact. There is the nurturing mother (aunt type, in the three good fairies) the incompetent parent (King/Queen/ and the good fairies when befuddled), and the feared/bad mother (you-know-who).  Jung would have liked the demonstration of what happens when you try to exclude the bad/feared parent from your consciousness. The Uninvited.  More scuttlebutt from the time the film was released: at first, Disney was going to have all the good fairies the same, and mysterious, (this was partly confirmed in the supplementary material on disk 2). This was rumored to be in response to critics who didn't like him giving the Dwarfs in Snow White, and later the Mice in Cinderella, very individual personalities.  Based on his many humorous, public comments, if this happened to be true, he might not have admitted paying attention to the critics.  When the animators complained that making the fairies the same was ""no fun,"" he decided to go the other way, and make them very individual, and since one of them was to be named Flora anyway, he decided to make her gently bossy, like his own mother, a school teacher, who was named Flora.  So Flora in SB is Disney's mother, and Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins is his father (with a little of Walt thrown in by Bill Walsh and Don Da Grady).  I would have used a larger orchestra, and not lightened Tchaikovsky's music quite so much (but in the fiery climax the music used is untouched, except for adding a repeat!. They did a marvelous thing by turning the ""Blue Bird"" into a vocalise for Aurora walking into the forest! c) ""Was it worth doing? "" Yes. And you will see several younger animators/artists in supplementary materials saying how much it influenced them. Favorite characters: Merriwether and Maleficent, the quintessence of projected evil.

883884,4,6304401132,"At a hefty cost of six million dollars and six years in production, Walt Disney?s ""Sleeping Beauty"" promised to be the most ambitious animated feature ever produced. However, changing public tastes resulted in a majestic glossy-looking effort that, despite its technical innovations, failed to become the blockbuster the studio had hoped for. The story, slightly changed from its Grimm?s fairytale origins, charts the birth of Princess Aurora (vocal by Mary Costa). The young Princess is cursed by the evil Maleficent, a horned sorceress visually realized by animator, Mark Davis, that has to rank among the all time great Disney villainesses. Before her sixteenth birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. But three good fairies believe otherwise. They usher off the baby Aurora into the woods and raise her as their own.  But Aurora meets up with her future in a big way when she comes across the brooding Prince Philip (vocal by Bill Shirley). He instantly succumbs to her charms, not realizing that she is the princess he is supposed to marry. But when Maleficent discovers their romance, she is determined to see that tomorrow never comes for the couple. The magnificently staged final show down between Prince Philip and Maleficent is chillingly good entertainment on every level and the story is as fresh and appealing to seniors as it is for the young at heart.
""Sleeping Beauty"" was shot in Technirama - a Cinemascope-style 2:35:1 aspect ratio that, in the past, has suffered on 1:33:1 television displays in a cropped off pan and scan image. On disc one of this two disc set we get both the Technirama transfer and a full frame copy ? to satisfy those who have yet to realize that full frame means fifty percent of the image is missing from their television screens. The review herein will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film which, in a word, is beautiful! Colors are rich, vibrant, bold and have been carefully rebalanced to provide a very smooth and crisp looking transfer. Black and contrast levels are fully realized.
A few problems - minor digital noise and a halo effect during portions of the forest sequence that flashes so quickly you almost have to stop and think, ""Did I just see that?"" The audio, remixed to 5.1 but strident, strangely lacking in bass - I say, strangely because ""Sleeping Beauty"" was recorded in stereo that, while, of course, should sound dated by today's standards, usually has a strong sonic bass characteristic that is curiously absent here.
Extras too are something of a disappointment. We get the ""Once Upon A Dream"" featurette - billed as a ?new? documentary on the making of the film. Created for the previously issued laserdisc and VHS copies this featurette is too short - not covering the scope of production. Next, there's the Peter Tchaikovsky Story - a badly acted and largely fictional account of the man who was inspired to write, among other things, the ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet. The transfer here is terribly faded, suffers from chips and scratches and digital noise, edge enhancement and shimmering fine details. We also get the ""Grand Canyon"" featurette that accompanied ""Sleeping Beauty"" on its original theatrical engagement, but again, as with the Tchaikovsky Story, all the same criteria apply and - this time - the Technirama image HAS NOT BEEN ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TELEVISION DISPLAYS!!!
There's a really, REALLY awful music video, some benign child's play and a few short featurettes that, among other topics, explain how the film was shot, the techniques used in the animation and the restoration process employed for this new DVD.
Over all, I could have done without these studio junkets, especially since none of them were even moderately cleaned up for inclusion into this special edition.

883886,5,6304401132,"Sad to say, but ""Sleeping Beauty"" is quite possibly the single most overlooked animated work of Walt Disney. While hard to believe, the 1959 film is rarely seen in it's proper perspective in the Disney universe.
Despite the film's strong following, it became the ""Dark Disney"" in later years. The dragon was seemingly too scary for the littler kids (Maleficent even uses the ""H"" word!), and the relative lack of funny animals in ""Sleeping Beauty"" was another drawback for the average Disney veiwer. As a result the film has never seemed to gain the notoriety and lasting love the other Disney's have always enjoyed. This lack of prominence makes this one of the biggest treats in the Disney vault, because it's almost a rediscovered classic from Disney's heyday.
All that being said, I have to admit that I've personally never seen the movie before I bought the DVD the other day! Oh, I've seen a few clips of the dragon and whatnot over the years, but never before have I had a chance to actually screen the complete film. This was a bit of good fortune, because now I got to screen the film in a pristine widescreen presentation. Lucky me!
The ""Dark Disney"" is brilliant, of course, and one wishes the studio had made a few more sojourns into the darker realm of fairy tales. Because we have been conditioned to expect kid-friendly funny animals from Disney, it's so easy to forget that Walt often wanted to push the envelope of education and art, and enlighten the audience while entertaining. With ""Sleeping Beauty"", he did it in spades.
I liked the way the Disney staff was able to extend the classic tale and at the same time retain most of the familiar elements we all know by heart (the forest of thorns, for example). Beyond that, the stylized artwork is all at once both nostalgic and timeless. The art has definite leanings toward more commercial/graphic work (a previous reviewer was spot-on mentioning 1950's greeting cards design). Best of all, despite the computer process used to clean up dust and correct color, there is no computer fakery in the animation itself, the crutch upon which the entertainment industry now depends for support in all things. Computer geeks should look to this film and see what REAL animators were once capable of!
What struck me most about the film (besides the stunning artwork), was just how much the film owed to ""Fantasia"" in both imagery and classical musical scoring. The images of the dancing minions in Maleficent's lair will certainly call to mind ""A Night on Bald Mountain"", and the music is in keeping with Walt's love of the classical musical sound. ""Once Upon a Dream"" is easily in the top five of all Disney songs, and the classical score brings to mind the famous Tchaikovsky ballet  based on the fairy tale.
The fairy godmothers are lots of fun, as are the kings, and the Prince's horse. To be honest, Prince William is not the most heroic Prince ever. Let's face it; the three fairy godmothers do most of the work, while the Prince takes the credit. Regardless, he does lend a bit more Princely derring-do to the Prince role than Snow White's Prince did.
Maleficent is truly scary, too! The imagery of the witch is at times provocative as well as frightening.
Lots of extras on Disc 2, including an excellent ""The Making Of"" documentary, and two featurettes of great note; ""Four Artists Paint One Tree"" shows four of Disney's premire animators in an excellent demonstration of artistic interpretations and individual styles, and a long featurette about Tchaikovsky called ""The Peter Tchaikovsky Story"". This secon feature is not exactly historically accurate, but it is interesting. The uncredited Paul Frees, ""The Man of a Thousand Voices,"" narrates.
We also have ""Grand Canyon,"" the 1959 Academy Award winner for short subject. The widescreen film follows the music of ""The Grand Canyon Suite"" (a la ""Fantasia""), showing us a depiction of life in the Grand Canyon. Beautiful photography spoiled only by the brief appearance of cuddly cougar kittens and bunny rabbits.
You'll also find a surprising feature, a ""Widescreen-to-Full screen Comparison."" The feature has a simple introduction, and then shows the two formats side-by-side during the ""Once Upon a Dream"" sequence. Although simplistic, this offers the viewer the opportunity to have the two formats clearly and concisely explained and demonstrated. While it seems like an afterthought as far as features go, it's a nice inclusion that once and for all spells out the difference between Widescreen (letterbox), and Full Screen (pan and scan). For the first Widescreen  animated feature film, ""Sleeping Beauty,"" I think you'll agree that Widescreen is the only way to go!
There are also some kid-friendly games on Disc 2, and a horrid modernized version of ""Once Upon a Dream"" in a music video (AVOID!).
This is one DVD set that no true fan of animation should be without. Anime fans should also take note, for modern anime has nothing on this rare cinematic acheivement from 1959.",1063411200,6,5002,4.904368358913813

883889,5,6304401132,This film is absolutely without a doubt one of Disney's best.  I remember seeing Sleeping Beauty in theaters when it was re-released in some theaters back in 1995. Since then I had been looking for a VHS copy of the movie. Well I got a DVD player and was REALLY happy when I found out that Sleeping Beauty was coming out on DVD. The restoration process is beautiful. This movie is a classic.

883890,3,6304401132,"The Blu-ray is indescribable. Seen on a 60"" plasma display, it's jaw-dropping. I saw the film theatrically more than 50 years ago, and the Blu-ray easily outclasses the Technicolor print. You finally /understand/ what Disney was trying to do, visually. As for the movie itself...

There is one truly great scene in ""Sleeping Beauty"" -- a scene, in fact, unique in all of Disney feature animation. Maleficent taunts the chained Prince Philip with the fear of growing old and ugly, while the sleeping Aurora remains young and beautiful, by showing him what will occur when she sets him free -- a hundred years from now. He sees himself as a decrepit old man with long white hair and beard, astride a horse destined for the glue factory.

""A wondrous future lies before you. You -- the destined hero of a charming fairy tale come true. Behold -- King Stephan's castle. And in yonder topmost tower, dreaming of her true love, the Princess Aurora... She is indeed most wondrous fair -- gold of sunshine in her hair -- lips that shame the red, red rose -- in ageless sleep she finds repose. The years roll by -- but a hundred years, to a steadfast heart, are but a day. And now, the gates of the dungeon part, and our prince is free to go his way. Off he rides, on his noble stead, a valiant figure, straight and tall, to wake his love, with love's first kiss, and prove that [extreme sarcasm] true love conquers all."" [mean-spirited laughter]

Now, I happen to _like_ bearded geezers, and (for me) Philip (who, when upset  or angry, looks a lot like Harrison Ford) is far more attractive in his old age. But Maleficent ""shoves in the knife"" by suggesting to Philip that, though he will not have changed inwardly, Aurora will nevertheless find him a repulsive old man. So much for ""love.""

This sequence grabs the romantic notions of physical attraction, love at first sight, and ""happily ever after"" by their figurative necks and rubs their faces in pig manure. It's marvelously cruel, even ugly, adding a nasty moment to a film that would benefit from a darker tone.

As generally disappointing a movie as ""Sleeping Beauty"" is, there _are_ some good things about it. Eleanor Audley's Maleficent is superb. Her malice is subtle -- she rants and raves only when driven to extremes. Audley brings a world-weariness to Maleficent only hinted at in the script, but which immensely deepens the character. Disney animated features have always had terrific character acting, but Audley's performance is primus inter pares. It's no wonder that Maleficent has never lost her place as everyone's favorite Disney villainess.

The animation is also superb. Human characters move naturally and fluidly, with believable weight -- the scene in which Philip and Aurora dance by the lake is remarkable. Philip's horse (note that ""Philip"" comes from Greek words meaning ""horse lover"") moves much like a real horse, with little caricature. Note also how fabrics (especially the fairies' and Maleficent's costumes) swirl and bounce with the proper inertia.

Eyvind Earle's magnificent production design needs no more praise than has already been lavished on it. It's pretty much the only reason ""Sleeping Beauty"" is of any lasting interest.

The frame-by-frame digital restoration was produced in the mid-'90s for a VHS and laserdisk release. It looks nothing short of incredible on DVD. I saw ""Sleeping Beauty"" during its initial run, and the DVD simply blows away the theatrical presentation. It'll knock your eyes out. My only complaint is that saturated colors - fabrics, a bird's plumage -- are simply too vivid for the otherwise subdued color palette.

The supplemental material is lavish, including two complete Disneyland shows, one a G-rated biography of Tchaikovsky, and the other about how four Disney artists ""interpret"" a tree. The artwork gallery is, however, disappointingly skimpy.

The commentary (running and otherwise) is terrific. It actually acknowledges and discusses the film's shortcomings, a first for Disney home video. The funniest moment occurs when the ever-optimistic Mary Costa opines that Disney and Tchaikovsky would have enjoyed working together. Richard Schickel is the only Disney biographer to accuse Uncle Walt of being homophobic, but I really doubt Walter and Peter would have found much of a basis for a relationship (even professional), if only because Tchaikovsky was a moody and profoundly unhappy person.

I'm sorry I can't give ""Sleeping Beauty"" more than a three-star (""average"") rating. The incredible artwork and outstanding animation cannot hide the fact there is no compelling story. It is for good reason that Aurora has long been known as ""the plastic princess.""",1063152000,6,4690,5.053040103492885
883891,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty stands as Disney's most visually stunning creation-filmed in 70mm and with designs by Eyvind Earle that combined modern design with the gothic stylings of the 14th Century. Paired with a score adapted from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet and excellent vocal perfomances, the film is fondly remembered by many.
The film itself draws more from the Brothers Grimm version of the tale as the Perrault version that inspired Tchaikovsky, but the score is perfectly appropriate. Maleficent, perhaps the greatest of the Disney villains, has crashed the party celebrating the birth of Princess Aurora, and curses the child to die on her 16th birthday, when she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel. The curse is partially negated by one of the three fairies who had come to bless the princess, and Aurora will instead fall into a deathless slumber, only to be awoken by true love's first kiss. The fairies decide to raise Aurora in secrecy until her 16th birthday, but Maleficent finds her the day before her 16th birthday, and manages to set the curse in motion, leaving Aurora's betrothed, Prince Philip, to awaken her.
The DVD is presented in widescreen and fullscreen formats, although watching the film in anything less than widescreen is a travesty. The film has been spectacularly restored, from the same process that was used to excellently restore Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The special features are expansive, and are, quite frankly, akin to the Platinum Editions that Snow White and Beauty and the Beast have received the past two years (and that The Lion King is geting next month).

883945,3,6304401132,"Once again Disney, aka the Evil Empire, shows why they cannot be beat when it comes to dvds. They do it right each time. Sleeping Beauty leaps off the screen with vivid color and sharp lines. Kiss your VHS version goodbye. And having a choice between the widescreen and fullscreen versions is great. The purist in me goes for widescreen whilst my wife and daughter choose full.
That said, this is Disney's lamest Princess movie. Aurora is a cipher, there and yet not there, no personality at all. Flora, Fauna and Merryweather are the true leads of this story. More should've been done with Maleficent; wasted potential here.
Now for the lack of logic.
First if ""before the sunsets on her 16th birthday she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die,"" could not the fairies have waited til the day AFTER to bring Aurora home? But then, no sleeping, I guess.
Second, Maleficent's goons have been searching for 16 years for Aurora, but as a baby. Now, wouldn't Maleficent, in those 16 years, at least ask once how things are going, instead of waiting all that time and then asking? This is a problem of poor business management. A good villainess would have appointed a head henchman and have him report to her on a daily or weekly basis.
Third, the 3 fairies have no clue how to bake a cake or make a dress for Aurora's 16th birthday. Well, who was cooking for all those years? And didn't they even attempt to bake a birthday cake the prior 15 times? And who made Aurora's outfit in which she goes gathering berries and meets Prince Philip? Sears?
Fourth, why doesn't Prince Philip speak anymore after telling King Hubert he's going to marry Aurora? Listen carefully; he does not speak for the rest of the movie after this point... come to think of it, neither does Aurora!
Fifth, when Philip races to the castle with the fairies in tow he has to hack away at all the brambles to get through. Why doesn't Flora or Fauna or Merryweather just make them disappear? If they can turn spears into flowers, brambles disappearing should be cake (which they don't know how to bake. Maybe that's the problem...).
Call me nit-picky but these things just leap out at me... why did I buy the dvd then? Because it was for my wife's birthday and this is her favorite movie in the whole world. Also, ""Aurora"" is our daughter's middle name... and I love my wife and daughter very much!",1063065600,8,2390,4.547563805104408
883946,4,6304401132,"It took Disney's animators six years to create ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the effort really shows in this magnificent rendering of the German fairy tale ""Dornroeschen"" or ""The Little Briar Rose."" The fairy tale is variously transcribed from European folktales by Perrault and The Bros. Grimm. (My favorite part in the Grimm rendering is how the arrival of the long-desired child is announced to the Queen-- she gets the news from a talking crab that jumps out of her bathwater. Now, what kind of crab would that be?)
Disney recreates the old tale with new characters--giving the good and evil fairies much more of a role--in fact, they steal the show. The good fairies are Flora, Fauna and Merrywether, three chubby, bell-shaped sprites, who were inspired by housewives the artists observed in grocery stores. And Maleficent, the stylish, Goth baddy who is tall, slim and has a bit of a smoker's rasp in her deliciously evil voice (played by Eleanor Audley.)
The fairies, good or evil, have so much to do, in fact, that Princess Aurora only gets to sing a bit (by an exceptional operatic soprano Mary Costa) and Prince Philip is equally reticent. The Prince gets a shocker early on in the tale--he has somehow been betrothed to Aurora since early childhood, but this interesting fact wasn't communicated to him until just before the wedding is to go off.) He is understandably miffed, gee, a guy should have SOME say in the matter, even if he doesn't get to pop the question, and after a set-to with Mom and Dad, he never says another word.
The real star here is the production, with the stylish Scandinavian Sixties art by Ervind Earle. Earle looked to folk art, Medieval art and tapestries for inspiration and mixed it with a fine modern sensibility to make a stunning set.  The animation owes a lot to Fantasia, which is especially noticible in the automated mops (Night on Bald Mountain) and Maleficent's domain. The artists wanted to avoid a repeat of ""Snow White"" and they certainly achieved a completely different look and feel. And taking the best of ""Fantasia"" was a good idea--as ""Fantasia"" itself was way ahead of its time and underappreciated until much later than its release in the Forties.
As to quality of the DVD, there was a glitch just as Philip is delivering the wakeup kiss to Aurora, the film jumps as if a few frames were cut. A glitch on this particular DVD? Strange that this happens at a critical moment.  The extras are well worth looking at, especially the interview with Earle and getting a look at the exquisite detail of the background artwork, giving any parent or grandparent a reason to enjoy the film for their own reasons while it runs for the umpteenth time on the DVD player.",1062979200,,2708,4.747346072186836
883947,5,6304401132,"This movie is one of the great classics of animation, especially for Disney.  The DVD version is significantly improved compared to the previous VHS tape.  The picture and sound were both greatly enhanced for this release.  Furthermore, both widescreen and full screen versions are available in this package.
As with Disney's other classics, some liberties were taken with the original story of Sleeping Beauty.  Disney took the classic story and made it unique and special.  In some ways the story is less violent and dark than the original fairy tale.  In other ways, such as the portrayal of Maleficent, the movie is dark and forbidding.  While the movie is generally a children's movie, Maleficent's dragon and her general demeanor can be somewhat frightening for some in the pre-school and younger set.
Aurora was the first love for many a young boy, and was also the model for the aspirations of millions of girls.  The romantic love story of Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip enchanted would-be princesses everywhere, and in some cases became the measure by which future spouses were measured (and many of us struggled to meet the ideal).
Of course, the romantic story and the evil of Maleficent were balanced by the comedy of the animal characters and the three bumbling, good-hearted fairy godmothers.  While their goodness may appear a bit too vanilla and sweet for some, it is perfect for those longing for the innocence of their youth.
While the movie is the most important part of the DVD, this two CD set contains a phenomenal number of extras.  I found the audio commentary by various key individuals to be absolutely fascinating.  I planned to listen to portions of the commentary in preparation for my review, and instead found myself listening to the entire thing because it was so incredibly fascinating.  Mary Costa (Princess Aurora) and others provide their perspective on the creation of the movie, as well as personal memories of Walt Disney and his influence on the film.  The audio commentary by itself is worth replacing your VHS tape, particularly for aficionados of Disney movies.
In addition to the audio commentary are numerous, emphasize numerous, other bonus features.  Some I felt were less than worthwhile, others, such as the shorts ""Grand Canyon"" and ""The Peter Tchaikovsky Story,"" were excellent bonuses.  The number of bonuses on this two disc set was so large that there is a navigational overview included in the DVD that categorizes 38 features found on the second disc.
With the movie and the wealth of bonuses, this movie is a must-buy for those who have yet to have ""Sleeping Beauty.""  For those who have the VHS, the bonus material is nearly worth the cost of the DVD.  Certainly those who are collectors of Disney memorabilia and historians of Disney will find the DVD to be a concise compendium of some of the best information available regarding this film.  I highly recommend this DVD!",1062547200,72,2935,4.955102040816326

It's the 14th Century and evil queen Malificent curses Aurora, the king's infant daughter, taking away her happily-ever-after. Or so it would seem.
The brilliant interpretation of Tchaikovsky's ballet score and the distinctive medieval-inspired art of Eyvind Earle's detailed, pastel-hued, vertical-horizontal compositions, make this timeless romance -- based on a folk tale that arose after the Dark Ages (and a metaphor for the times?) -- a must-have for the digital family library and a masterpiece of animators' art.

""Sleeping Beauty"" was a turning point for Disney when animators sought a more sophisticated look for their animation and presented it in widescreen. The abundance of extra features for this dvd show how this look was achieved with a history of behind the scenes which includes samples, restoration comparisons and interviews from many of the animators. Also included are games (""Rescue Aurora"" and ""Princess Personality Game""), music videos, art projects, art galleries, trailers, scrapbooks, publicity posters, etc. Also included: a 25 minute short film ""Grand Canyon"", and two other shorts - ""The Peter Tchaikovsky Story"", and ""Four Artists Paint One Tree"".
The commentary is especially noteworthy and informative. It features a narration by Disney historian Jeff Kurtti with the participation of Eyvind Earle (art director), Mary Costa (voice of Aurora), Ollie Johnston (supervising animator), Marc Davis (supervising animator), Frank Armitage (background painter), Mike Gabriel (Disney artist) and Michael Giaimo (Disney artist).
The dvd has the option of viewing it in widescreen mode (enhanced for 16x9 televisions) or full screen. I must add that viewing it in full screen will be a travesty - the full glory of this artistic accomplishment is best seen in widescreen!",1062028800,,1345,5.533980582524272

The movie is (obviously) a classic, and the animation holds up well in the face of the modern, stylized approach to traditional animation. True, there aren't any computer-generated images in ""Sleeping Beauty,"" but it remains one of the best-crafted cartoons of all time.
I was very impressed with the sound and picture quality, and the choice to watch the movie widescreen or full-screen was a nice feature. It's the best presentation of ""Sleeping Beauty"" that I've ever seen.
The second disk is packed with in-depth information about the making of the movie, and the restoration of the film for this DVD release. It's great stuff for afficionados, but it's even interesting for casual fans.

As with all of the Disney special edition DVD releases, the quality spoils you for the multitude of other older films put out on DVD from other labels without the care and expertise of video and audio restoration in which Disney obviously is a master. Yet another wonderful job was done on this film. If you are already a fan of Sleeping Beauty I'm sure this package will knock your socks off. Buy it now, (and don't worry about the rest of this review.) I just still don't get why anyone would be a particular fan of this one over the far superior and memorable Snow White, Dumbo, Toy Story 1 & 2, Roger Rabbit, etc, etc.
I know I saw this as a kid on the BIGGGG screen in the first few years after it came out. I didn't like it then, and it was so forgetable I didn't remember hearing any of the music before, and only remembered seeing some of the scenes. Probably slept through it 40 years ago. I still find it to be slow paced, plodding and basically boring compared to those other Disney classics. I watched this DVD with my wife (who also didn't care much for it as a kid, or in this cleaned up version) and our 3 young kids (2 boys & 1 girl). The kids were completely disinterested through out the film. They had a great time when we showed them Snow White and Dumbo. The multitude of extras included didn't interest us much either, it's nice they are there if you are really into this movie. One of the main complaints I have with this movie (besides plodding) over the other older Disney classics is actually with the animation. Sure, it's nice to be in widescreen, but all those wonderfully detailed backgrounds don't go with the style of the characters put on top. Most of the characters are quite simply drawn, fairly flat and plain. They don't blend well with their surroundings. Snow White and Dumbo don't have that problem.
If you already specifically love this movie, for what ever reason, you'll love the quality of this DVD set. If you are after the truely great unforgettable Disney classic about a beautiful girl in a deep sleep, woken up by the kiss of a handsome prince--well that would be Snow White. If you are just looking for a wonderfully FUN family movie, you are on the wrong page again--that would be the Toy Stories and Who Framed Roger Rabbit! Or venture beyond Disney, and treat your whole family to the incredible DVD of Yellow Submarine.
Unless you just have to own THIS movie, do yourself and your kids a favor and buy any of the other truely great and entertaining Disney classics instead. Because it's not a shoe-in your kids will like this.",1061424000,2,2855,4.429657794676806

884044,5,6304401132,"Keyed to the style of Disney artist Ervind Earle, SLEEPING BEAUTY has long been renowned as one of Walt Disney Studio's most artistically beautiful films--and now with this meticulous restoration Earle's vision comes to the home market in a DVD package that is sure to win praise from every fan of hand-drawn animation.

The story, of course, is the time-honored fairy tale. Princess Aurora is cursed at birth by the evil Maleficent, who declares that on her sixteenth birthday the princess shall prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die--but fortunately the powers of good are able to mute the effect of the curse; the princess shall not die, but shall instead fall into a deep sleep from which she can be only awakened by love's first kiss.

Earle's vision for the story is drawn from a host of sources, some of them more immediately apparent than others. The result is a curious mixture of flat illustration and meticulous detail that imparts both a modernist edge and the quality of an ancient illuminated manuscript--a truly remarkable concept that gives the film a visual style completely unlike any other among the Disney classics.  The DVD offers the option of viewing the film in either its original widescreen ratio or pan-and-scan format--but why any one would elect pan-and-scan is completely beyond me; if ever there was a film that made good and full use of the widescreen ratio, this is it, and you'll want to see every inch of Earle's remarkable work.

Earle's style aside, SLEEPING BEAUTY has been influenced by a number of films that are worth noting.  In terms of plot detail, it has been very clearly influenced by Disney's earlier SNOW WHITE, and the designs for the evil Maleficent and her ""goons"" are very clearly influenced by FANTASIA's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" sequence--and to magnificent effect; Maleficent is easily among the darkest characters ever created for film.  Interestingly, many visual set-ups also seem to have been influenced by MGM's THE WIZARD OF OZ, most notably in the scenes in which the three good fairies rescue Prince Philip from Maleficent's nightmarish castle.

Unlike some animated films, the voices are beautifully matched to the characters, with Mary Costa as Princess Aurora and Eleanor Audley (who also performed the Wicked Stepmother in Disney's CINDERELLA) as Maleficent standouts among the cast.  The score, which is based on the brilliant Tchaikovsky ballet score, is also extremely well handled and includes the memorable ""Once Upon a Dream.""

All of this has been lovingly, shining restored, and quite frankly even if you saw the film in its first release the result here will no doubt surpass it.  There is not a blip, a glitch, or a sound-surge to be found.  And as is usual with Disney ""limited release"" DVD editions, the package includes a host of extras, some designed to appeal to the younger set (there are two simple games, neither of which require a CD-ROM) for children and a host of interviews and documentaries.  Fortunately, many of the people involved in SLEEPING BEAUTY are still with us--including Ervind Earle and Mary Costa--and their various contributions make the bonus package truly superior.

All of this said, it should be noted that like FANTASIA, SLEEPING BEAUTY is more likely to appeal to adults who can fully appreciate the visual charms of the film than to children, who may find the film's tendency to linger over visuals a bit too much for a limited attention span.  But this is indeed a Disney masterpiece, and it belongs in your collection.

884046,5,6304401132,"Following in the traditional style of Walt's masterpieces Snow White and Cinderella, this Disney classic is true to the Charles Perraut version of the French fairy tale. Over six years in the making and entailing a budget of over 6 million dollars, 'The Sleeping Beauty' became one of the top-grossing movies of 1959, second only to Ben Hur.

Sleeping Beauty was the first animated motion picture to be filmed in the 75 mm widescreen format, unlike its predecessors Cinderella, Pinocchio and Snow White. The animation, which is extremely luscious and poignant, is also portrayed in finer details. The Renaissance influenced backgrounds and castles and the vibrant splendor of the forests are a beauty to be marveled at. Equally outstanding is the brilliant adaptation of the Peter Tchaikovsky score, which is richly melodious and simply surrounds you throughout the movie. The Oscar nominated score truly adds to the visual stunningness of Sleeping Beauty.

The characters are wonderfully created with an in-depth look into each of their respective personalities. Princess Aurora is the deity of beauty and feminine coyness embedded in a romantic heart. Prince Phillip is handsome, brave, noble and passionate and possesses every virtue of an ideal hero. Maleficent is a unique villain, her cruelty and wickedness sometimes a little too scary for younger viewers. The three good fairies; Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, are each created with remarkable liveliness. Flora is the self-appointed leader of the trio; Fauna of a soft-hearted, peace-loving nature; and Merryweather her impatient, practical-minded self. King Stefan and Hubert and the prince's horse, Samson add a lot of humor to the tale.

The vocal talents comprise of Mary Costa as Aurora, whose solo classical numbers are a pleasure to hear. Eleanor Audley, who had brought to life Cinderella's cruel stepmother with stunning chillness, was asked by Walt Disney himself to portray the role of Maleficent. Bill Shirley is excellent as the speaking and singing voice of Phillip and Verna Felton voices Flora with warmth and spasm.

Overall, a visual and musical masterpiece which is coming to a 2 Disc special edition DVD on September 7, 2003 in the US; and has already been released in a 2 Disc collector's set in Europe the April of this year. I own the European one, and must say that 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer is breath-taking. The European Disc also provides a fascinating DTS track; which although not available for the US release, is compensated there by an additional 1.33:1 fullscreen presentation of the movie and a few trailers (but take it from me, the visual beauty of this movie can only be appreciated in the widescreen format). The bonus features on Disc two offer an in-depth look at the film itself and how it was made. Also included are vast virtual galleries, a set-top game, some live-action references and lots of other interesting aspects. So enjoy this classic masterpiece from Disney in all its glory. I simply adore this movie and shall always cherish it with me.",1059696000,11,3062,5.142570281124498

When Disney first stuck their foot in the DVD waters they did it slowly, offering movies without major extras and at a price well above their competition.  With a stable of classics in their coffers I wrote some scathing reviews and comments on various web sites.  Disney finally got it through their heads that DVD has broken through to become the standard format for the new millenium.
Several other Disney Disks have gotten this deluxe treatment.  Their collaborations with Pixar; Toy Story One and Two, A Bugs Life, Monsters Inc were among the first. Tarzan, Atlantis, Beauty and the Beast as well as Dumbo and a variety of lesser films have editions chock full of extras as well.

884133,5,6304401132,"1959: Disney's presence had already been established. ""Snow White"" was the first animated film ever to grace the big screen and Disney had dazzled audiences with the 1940 ""Fantasia"". But in 1959, ""Sleeping Beauty"" won the hearts of fairy tale lovers, romance lovers and the young at heart. Disney was back in the saddle. The animation to the Sleeping Beauty was taken from the greeting card designs and artwork of a 50's artist. Set in the medieval 14th century, at times resembling the beautiful tapestries and cathedrals of the day, Sleeping Beauty is embellished with cool hues of purple, blue, green and black. A magic romanticism fills the air from start to finish. The score to the film was taken from the ballet music of the Tchaikovsky ballet by the same name. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" ballet is in fact Tchaikovsky's greastet musical masterpiece, and Disney merely sliced up some of the melodies to fit certain moods and scenes in the film. He also put lyrics to the enchanting ""Sleeping Beauty Waltz""- in the song ""Once Upon A Dream"" in which the Prince and the would-be Sleeping Beauty meet for the first time, waltz and fall in love.
True in many respects to the old fairy tale, which some claim originated in Germany, others in France, where it is known as ""La Belle Au Bois Dormant""- the tale is brought back to life through classic Disney charm. Princess Aurora (named after the Roman goddess of the dawn) is born to King Stephen and his Queen (The March from the Tchaikovsky ballet plays) and all the inhabitants of the land come to her Christening in the great hall of the castle. Aurora's three fairy godmothers Flora, Fauna and Merryweather (later Disney animators said they based them on three actual little old ladies) bestow the baby princess with the gifts of song and grace. But the Gothic enchantress Maleficent, the rotten apple in the bunch, was not invited and naturally, she is outraged. She wears a purple-black robe, has Devil horns on her head and her constant companion on her shoulder is a black raven. ""Sometimes I don't think she's very happy"" Fauna says of her. Caught up in a nasty mood, the evil sorceress casts an evil spell on Aurora. She will prick her finger on a spinning wheel an die on her sixteenth birthday. To avoid this catostrophe, King Stephen orders all the spinning wheels burned. Merriweather, the fairy in blue, brings hope- only the kiss of a brave and noble prince will lift the curse of the death-like sleep.
That prince is Phillip, who was already engaged to wed Aurora as a boy, (in an obvious statement about political unions in European monarchies). The three fairies do their best to prevent the terrible fate on Aurora, so they hide with her in their cottage in the deep forest and change her name to Briar Rose, raising her as their own child. But.. luck would have it, she meets Prince Phillip as he is hunting, they waltz and fall in love and she is brought back to the castle where she was born. There, Maleficent makes her prick her finger on the spinning wheel in a hypnotic trance. The spell is cat Poor Aurora...
But you know the rest, don't you ? Fairy tale loves always have a happy ending. The Tchaikovsky music, the artistic animation, and the engaging story will delight audiences as far into the future as 2059. In 1959, children and young girls might have been captivated (they said that Aurora was based on either Leslie Caron or Audrey Hepburn) but in the future, the tale will still win hearts. Young girls will once again be gripped. Virtue will be rewarded. After all, ""true love conquers all.""",1052265600,48,3576,4.6868044515103335

The colors screamed off of the screen, and were at their best when the fairies were ""warring"" over what color to make Aroura's birthday dress. The fairies themselves were incredibly fun to watch & listen to, but the real star of the film was the most evil of all Disney's bad guys: Maleficent. When she laughs, your blood crawls. And when she turns into a dragon, the graphics are amazing.
I can only imagine what the restoration process will do to the colors in this movie, but if the restoration of ""Snow White"" is any indication, then the relaease on DVD of Sleeping Beauty will be the masterpiece of all animated films.
I can NOT wait until September for the release of this film. Even my kids are salavating at the thought of having this in our family DVD library.",1051574400,,979,4.4748603351955305
884135,4,6304401132,"Before the hardcore Disneyphiles ready their pitchforks, let me explain that yes, I enjoyed the movie when I was younger, I enjoyed the songs and the characters and the overall experience. However, rewatching it recently I've noted that most of the points people seem to rave about (the music, the villaness) are borderline cliched when compared to other Disney movies. Maleficent is evil, sure, and yes her pet bird is cool but she's far from the end-all-be-all of Disney villanry. Aurora/Sleeping Beauty is the epitome of a boy-crazy 16 year old girl (complete with the ""But WHY can't I fall in love with the Prince?!"" whine-scene reminescent of the entire ""Triton arguing with Ariel"" scene(s) from that -other- Disney movie, ""The Little Mermaid""), but her singing voice is fair enough, so that can be overlooked (to an extent). The 3 fairies were mere fodder. Amusing, and sometimes laugh-worthy, but mostly there just to hold the story together. The deus-ex-machinas that crawled out of the woodwork for the 2nd half of the film were less than belivable, and mostly cringe-worthy. (example: ""Aurora's walking into a corridor! It's Malifecent!"" and later the faires just -happen- to know Malifecent's weak spot..? Ri-ght..) Disney has been known to overhype the snot out of their dvd releases, and this will be no exeption. The special features -sound- like they'd be something that would intrest the average child viewer, but from an adult standpoint, they reek of ""Fodder made in less than 2 months just so we could take up the 2nd dvd."" A making of special, a few games and some other random things that Disney whipped up in less time than it took to actually create the film. All in all, buy it if you don't want to settle for the VHS tape or if you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have -every- Disney DVD that's released, but otherwise, stick with the VHS tape or see if you can buy it secondhand.",1051142400,2,1917,4.794561933534744

I do have one comment about the review of the foreign DVD 2-disc set.
Sadly there is NO guarantee that what has been released in Europe will be what we get in the US and vice-versa. For example the Legend DVD here in the US is far superior to the European release, with more extras etc.. And the Brotherhood of the Wolf DVD released in Canada is a 2 or 3-disc set instead of the one disc we got here in the US.

Yet you can't find it in the shops and Disney don't have a release date. Well, I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that Sleeping Beauty- Special Edition is now available on DVD. The bad news is that it's available in the UK, and not the US as yet. However, I can tell you all about it.
The 2 Disc Collectors Edition features an all new remastered edition of this Disney animated classic, and it is quite frankly the best looking Sleeping Beauty you'll ever see. The animation looks fantastic and the music is more beautiful than ever. As for special features there is the typical behind the scenes animation info and history that you might find on a Gold Collection release except spread out over two discs. So there's definitely room for an an Ultimate Edition.
When Sleeping Beauty was first released in 1959 it was a commercial failure, but became more popular when it was released on video. It has since been re-released on video several times, but it has never been more welcome than it is this time round, because it is the best looking and sounding version so far.
Here's hoping that when Disney release it in the US, it has a few more special features added, and receives even more of the recognition that it deserves.",1048118400,2,1391,4.5019762845849804

884203,5,6304401132,"Though it is remembered nowadays as a masterpiece of animation, when the film was released in 1959, it got the cold shoulder from moviegoers, mostly because of its adult themes and hellish villian.  The uptight society of the day did not take to it too well.  But today, we know the genius behind the movie.  The film revolves around Aurora, a Princecess who will one day succed Father, King Stefan as ruler of the Kingdom.  But the King's enemy, Maleficent the evil fairy, does not take kindly to this and lets out a warning that Aurora will die on her 16th birthday when she pricks her finger on a spindle.  Not sweet is it.  But the King's friends, the good faries (sorry I cannot remember their names), offer to take the princecess to a secret place in the woods to hide her from Maleficent, until her 16th birthday has ended.
That is the plot.  The animation in this movie still holds up today for its rich colors, sharp contrasts in moods and settings (Stefan's Castle is bright and proud while Maleficent's Castle is vile, dark and ominous) and simply unforgettable characters.  The three fairies are an absolute delight to watch.  If you need any one scene from this movie to prove what I just said, see the finale where Prince Phillip battles Maleficent as a colassal dragon from hell.
This movie got Disney going on the path that would eventually, though it took another 30 years, lead them to the Aladdin, Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, even though they had dabbled in Adult themes before.

884205,4,6304401132,"I was in Lebanon for a week and was extremely surprised to find the Sleeping Beauty DVD in their Virgin Megastore, though the cover was in French, the employees there assured me it was in English too.
The box is beautiful all in purple feautring the classic kiss scene with the transparent head of Maleficent over them. it's a gorgeous matt box that's open from the right.
All the contents of the DVD is written on the back (in french sadly). Through the pocket you pull out the 2 DVD envelope case (like the EU Harry Potter DVD), the DVDs looks gorgeous and full of color. It also includes a shett of the scene numbers.
The first DVD before anything asked if I wanted to watch the whole DVD in english or french- which i found delightful since I've never seen this in any DVD- and everyhting from menu to little details was in english.
It contains the movie, making of feature, rescue Aurora game & a coloring book. The back of the DVD states there's also a special episode of Art Attack about making Sleeping Beauty's castle- sadly I didn't find this on the disk, so I don't know if this is a Hidden Feature. I tried to look for it but couldn't find it. One this is for sure, it's not on DVD 2. Interesting!
Disk 2 was a disappointment since the menus are in french so I didn't know what was going on, and sadly even some of the videos were dubbed French over the english track, which is very annoying and unprofessional. And the features that actually were in English had large french subtitles, and there's is no option for not viewing subtitles. I must admit that the french menus are a turn off, so sadly I lost all anticipation to watch the special features that i eagerly awaited.
One very important note, the DVD menus and Design is STUNNIG, the menus are made like old manuscripts and it's gorgeous. A very big shock is that this DVD is not released as a part of the ""platinum collection"" like Snow White & Beauty and the Beast, yet production wise, the cover, package, disk and menu designs surpass both Special Edition DVDs by a hundred mile.
the only reason I'm writing this review is because I couldn't find any information about this DVD anywhere (even on Disney.com) and I thought Fans of this movie would love to know what they're getting.

884206,5,6304401132,"This is, by far, my favorite cartoon ever.  It was the one I watched most as a kid and the one that I still think the most about today.  I know the DVD isn't released yet, but I have no doubt that high definition and widescreen will be enough to make it a superior buy.
What is perhaps the best about this movie is that Tchaikovsky's score is used instead of some odd Disney musician.  Don't get me wrong, Disney has turned out some wonderful songs over the years, but when the entire score comes from one ballet, there is a flow to the entire movie that other Disney films don't have.  The music seems to all be drawn from a common theme, not several seperate songs thrown together like it is today.
Furthermore, Disney's recent political correctness isn't present at all; Phillip & Aurora's fathers get drunk together, something that would never but put on screen today.
The characters are also very well drawn.  Even if it was all hand drawn and there are no computer special effects, I think that Aurora and Phillip are probably the best looking couple Disney has ever turned out.  The backgrounds are also lushly rendered in watercolors, not the computerized exaggerations so prevalent in ""Hercules"" and later films.
The horror and comic relief are great as well, strong and engaging enough even for the most mature audiences to still be enthralled.  Maleficent and the three fairies play at odds very well and I think that the charcters share some very deep screen chemistry, even for an animated movie.
That's what I like the most.  The film wasn't made for children; it is truly an animated ""feature film"" for audiences of all kinds and, though I like most of Disney's movies, none really can compare to ""Sleeping Beauty.""",1030579200,2,1730,4.667763157894737

The most extraordinary thing about this animated film is that no computers were used.  Every pose was hand-drawn and painted (remember when animated films were drawn by hand?), and transferred to 70 mm, another first for a Disney film.
This is guaranteed to make a great transition to DVD.  The restored version on VHS is already beautiful and it's not even in widescreen.  Not only can I not wait to see the film in its original format, but I also look forward to also seeing other documentaries about the process of making the movie and why it is still timeless today.  Hopefully they'll produce a disk or two similar to the one they made for ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" celebrating the debut of a landmark animated film on DVD.  If only studio execs would get cracking!",1027987200,12,1006,4.882352941176471
884278,5,6304401132,"""Sleeping Beauty"" has always been something of an anomaly in the Disney canon.  There isn't another movie like it, animated or otherwise, and its tendency to go overlooked renders the distinction all the more tragic.  With all due respect to ""Pinocchio,"" ""Bambi, ""Fantasia,"" ""Cinderella"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,""  they're just not ""Sleeping Beauty.""
Walt Disney made his sixteenth animated feature (and there is no more appropriate number for this particular fairy tale) at a volatile stage in his studio career, and the final product reflects many experimental but surprisingly harmonious influences.  The entrancing score was taken from an original ballet by Tchaikovsky, and the animation, clearly derived from medieval imagery, has both an astonishing purity and a curious quaintness.  It doesn't leap off the screen the same way ""Snow White"" does, and the human characters, many of whom are intentionally comic as opposed to heroic figures, don't have nearly as much fullness or dimension.
""Sleeping Beauty,"" based on a story by Charles Perrault, transforms that vice into a virtue.  What to make, after all, of a fairy tale whose heroine spends most of the movie out of commission?  Well, if you're Walt Disney, you relegate the near-perfunctory love story to the backburner while the Good Fairies and Maleficent calmly steal the picture.  A risky solution, but in this case, the best one.  Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who were inspired by real-life old ladies at the supermarket (Merryweather, in particular, is so cute you wish you could keep her on your bookshelf), have an intoxicating fussiness, and their conversation sparkles with the sort of pleasant banter you can enjoy as a child and enjoy even more as an adult.  As for Maleficent (magnificently voiced by Eileen Audley), running neck-and-neck with ""The Little Mermaid's"" Ursula for the title of all-time greatest Disney villain, she's a wickedly charismatic presence, as chillingly beautiful as she is demonic.
Scene for scene, ""Sleeping Beauty"" has more imaginative visual curlicues and hidden-gem sequences than nearly any other Disney movie.  To watch the film a second, third or fiftieth time is to be in a state of constant anticipation of the next glorious set-piece, whether it's the harrowing extended climax -- a truly thrilling clash between good and evil, and a considerably more violent spectacle than we're accustomed to in movies like this -- or a moment as simple and luminous as the Fairies disappearing into a jewelry case.
The animators have employed a higher degree of stylization and more surreal touches than usual (watch the early scenes in which the Fairies bestow their individual gifts upon the princess), complemented in full by Tchaikovsky's marvelous music.  I can't remember when I've seen such an impressive confluence of sound and image, such a seamless match-up between the nuances of melody and rhythm and the accompanying shifts in color and movement.  The score is unapologetically devoid of Broadway-style numbers and tongue-in-cheek lyrics (there is one musical sequence featuring the requisite ""cute"" rabbits, robins, squirrel and owl, none of whom, thankfully, burst into song), lending the film a timeless classicism that today's animation, steeped in pop-culture references and misguided attempts at Gen-Y appeal, can only dream of.
I watched ""Sleeping Beauty"" recently for the first time in nearly a decade, and the experience was like reuniting with a very old, very eccentric friend.  I could analyze it to death (I probably already have), but fairy tales, especially Disney fairy tales, aren't made to withstand academic scrutiny.  They're made to be remembered, not as a homogeneous mishmash of stale happy endings, but as individual vintages, each with its own vivid flavors and memories.  ""Sleeping Beauty"" -- to quote a lesser classic, the fairest of them all -- is a film to savor and cherish.",1022371200,30,3930,5.264
884279,5,6304401132,"I have watched this film countless times with my daughter, and find it to be one of the most beautiful drawn Disney features to date.

While she is being blessed by the 3 good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and the adorably chubby and rambunctious Merryweather, Maleficent rears her most intriguing, green pointed head.  Angry about not being invited to the gathering, she bestows an evil curse upon the newborn, to ""prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and DIE"".  This to happen before sundown on he sixteeth birthday.

The tale is beautifully spun among lushly drawn surroundings populated with one of a kind characters.  Aurora is beautiful and innocent in the face of impending danger, King Hubert's son Prince Phillip is one of the most handsome princes.  The three fairies who guard and raise Aurora in secret to protect her whereabouts from Maleficent, are lots of adorable fun.  Speaking of Maleficent, she is probably my favorite Disney villain of all time, tied perhaps,  with Snow Whites' ""Old Hag"", who is hideously hard to beat in the villain realm.

The most impressive thing is the story adaptation. If you know the book, you will notice that the passage of time is obviously nonexistent. The Disney staff had the good sense to broaden story vignettes- like showing the prince and princess meet in the forest and fall in love, unaware that they are already engaged to be married; or create a comic sequence with the fairies preparing a surprise party for their charge that goes awry, and simultaneously gives away their hiding place to Maleficent. All of these sequences seamlessly bring the story to a 75-minute feature length film- which is still amazingly compact when compared to fantasy films of today.

The same goes for the prince, although he does rescue this victim (with MUCH help from the fairies).  But that's okay, the classic Disney films have a way of giving the spotlight to what should be side characters.  Perhaps sticking to the original plot would be just too uninteresting anyway.  This said, the film has some very beautiful scenes, and I don't recall an abundance of hateful musical numbers, which in my book is a good thing!  Nice animation, decent plot that does not drag, except for the scenes that take place in the castle while the Princess is in her exile; there are some scenes that take place between the two Kings that needed to be edited.  At the same token there are scenes with the fairies and Maleficent, both suspensful and humorous that more than make up for the staler moments.  Overall, not to be missed for adults and children!  By the way, this one deserves 4.5 stars but you know how the rating system works!",1003968000,,1200,4.622641509433962

884350,5,6304401132,"Sleeping Beauty is one of the most original Disney movies to come out ever, no contest. The way the story strings itself together with such clean cleverness assures that this is some of the most masterful storytelling ever put to animation. It's a tremendous, stunning musical with songs to delight the heart and dreamy forest sets and thrilling medievil battles. The film will have you holding on to your pillow in the suspense scenes and have you heart tickled in the romantic loveliness.

884351,5,6304401132,"This is my absolute FAVORITE Disney movie!! It was the one I watched over and over when I was little - mostly for the fairies. Now, my favorite character has to be MALEFICENT - she is the best villain in Disney! Elegant, delightfully wicked with a voice, wardrobe and raven to be envied! Oh - and Aurora and Philip are great too *wink*. Pleeeeease, Disney, release this on DVD so us children who grew up long after it was released on the big screen can finally see it in widescreen...(and all its glory).",989107200,2,504,4.43010752688172
884352,5,6304401132,"Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of the most macabre and dark pictures ever. The tale of good versus evil is magically brought to life through an astonishing visual display of elite and sinister animation, combined with our heroes and villians, and a well-rendered musical score that is taken from the very music of Tchaikovsky. There is no doubt about it: this is a meticulous and excellently crafted motion picture which remains one of Disney's most ambitious and intriguing.
The story remains the same: the princess Aurora is born into King Stephen's royal court, the pride and joy of all the kingdom, where celebrations and gifts are bestowed upon the small child. Tragedy strikes when the lone misfit of the kingdom, the evil and crafty Malificent, rains on their parade to place a curse on the child: ""Before the sun sets on her 16th birthday, she shall prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel, and die!"" The kingdom is in peril with this news, and so the three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather conceal the child deep within the forest in a hidden cottage, raising the child under the assumption that she is of no royal relation.
But what Disney movie would be complete without the obligatory second act of villainous treachery and heroes saving the day? This movie follows that same pattern, but in such an intense way that outweighs some of the live-action suspense we get from mainstream films. Malificent's curse comes true, and so it is up to Prince Phillip, whose love interest in the young princess drives him on his journey to seek out and rescue the maiden while defeating the creepy witch.
Everything in this movie screams the word ""medieval,"" from the animation of the elaborate castles to the creation of the forests and acts of mysticism and nature which accompany them. Attention to detail is great, focusing on such things as woven tapestries decorating the walls and ceilings of the castles, while the clothing worn by the characters dances between the elite society and the middle-class quite nicely. Other important settings in the movie, such as Malificent's castle, are given a gloomy, ominous look, dark and stormy, full of rotting and decay.
This is also a classic evil-against-good story as well, attributing its successful execution to thr dazzling displays of magical powers as well as swarthy swordfights. Prince Phillip's treck through the forest of thorns still brings a certain amount of heightened suspense to an audience, while Malificent's character brings unease and restlessness to viewers. She is the embodiment of true evil, which is easy to see, while Prince Phillip is everything we want in a hero: dashing, morally just, and committed to his one true love.
Comical relief is provided stupendously within the efforts of the three fairies, whose arguments amongst one another are hilarious and laugh-out-loud funny. Flora takes on the serious role, the one with the level head who makes sure that everything goes according to her plan. Fauna is douty and bird-brained, yet sweet-natured and high-spirited. Merriweather is the rebel, and her machinations in rebellion of Flora's perfect plans bring some funny moments, especially in a battle of the wills at the small cottage as they prepare for Aurora's birthday.
The musical score plays throughout almost the entire film, unlike certain Disney films which have breaks in the score. The musical numbers sung by Aurora and Prince Phillip sell us on their love for one another, while the dark and brooding music of Malificent's power and evil fit the scenes perfectly. There are times when the music is frightening, and times when it brings cheer and delight to us.
""Sleeping Beauty"" remains one of my favorite movies, maintaining all the classical elements of the original work while giving it a wondrous and invigorating look. The visual style is comething to be admired and adored, while the story and the characters are crafted with heart and wit. This is Disney's darkest yet most complex piece, perhaps ever.",988934400,34,4022,5.022455089820359

884354,5,6304401132,"I bought the widescreen VHS version of Sleeping Beauty about 4 years ago, and it was the first time I had seen any Disney movies on widescreen video.  With an aspect ration of 2.35:1 (I think) this movie has a cinematic feel to it, especially in the scenes with Aurora and the Prince dancing at the lakeside.
This movie is just such a classic.  Unllke alot of Disney movies before and after, this one is not so bubbly and happy, in fact it's kind of dark at parts.  When I saw it as a kid, Malevalent scared me alot!  With the widescreen aspect ration, the sharp classic animation style, and some wonderful music and songs (taken from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty Ballet themes), in particular, ""Once Upon a Dream,"" this movie is one you should definitely add to your collection!!
Oh, I forgot, they don't make it any more (at least not the widescreen version) and it's not out on DVD yet.  Hopefully they will come out with it soon, in widescreen, and with some good extras, like the short documentary at the end of the VHS version.  A true classic!",983059200,6,1051,4.505263157894737

884397,5,6304401132,"In comparison to the tripe that Disney produces now, this movie is even  more classic than it was when it was first made. The classic story of  ""Sleeping Beauty"" was ALMOST never better-produced (I still think  the ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" version is best, sadly not produced  anymore)
The animation is unusual for a Disney production--it adds length  and the appearance of fitness to the bodies of the humans, while making the  fairies... rotund? But the animation, rather than making the characters  look like the Barbie-and-Ken bodies of ""Pocahontas"" makes them  look beautiful and noble. In addition, the scenery in the movie is  breathtaking--the interior of the castle, the fields in which Maleficent  and the prince do battle, and the forest where Aurora first meets  Philip.
A baby princess is born to a kindly king and queen, who invite  hundreds to the celebration--including three fairies to bestow blessings on  the baby. But the evil witch Maleficent shows up as well--and curses baby  Aurora with death on her sixteenth birthday. But the third fairy is able to  soften the curse into sleep until a kiss wakens her.
And for added  safety, the fairies take Aurora, under the name ""Briar Rose"" out  to the forest to raise her. All goes smoothly until she falls in love with  a young man in the forest, but is told that she is betrothed to Prince  Philip. Guess who the young man is.
As her sixteenth birthday approaches,  the fairies bring Briar Rose back to the castle--only to discover that  they're delivering her straight into Maleficent's grasp.
Maleficent still  holds the record for best Disney villain--we don't need any explanation for  her evil works, except that she's pure evil! In case the horns on her cap  didn't tip you off! Her acts of evil towards the king and queen, Aurora and  Philip would be acceptable in an adult movie. That's how amazing she is as  a villainess, rather than the blustering morons that Disney has had  recently. She's not obvious--and watch out for her casual jaunts through  her ghastly castle!
Aurora was a big improvement on ""Snow  White""--the only reason she doesn't decide her own destiny is because  she's royal. And Philip is the perfect match for her--I was in love with  him when I was a kid. He's strong, masculine, funny, and adventurous, and  the final battle with Maleficent is breathtaking in its dark  violence.
The music is amazing: the beautiful ""Once Upon a  Dream"" is a unique song, one that I still remember even though it's  been five years since I last watched the video.
And thankfully, the humor  is still sophisticated. Nowhere are the screaming gross-out antics of Timon  and Pumbaa. One of the sweetest scenes in the movie is when the three  fairies get into a massive, impressive fight over cakes and dresses for  Aurora's birthday, one that lasts until the end.
A beautiful, dark,  bright movie that adds pizzazz to an old favorite, this movie is a must-see  for any kids who ever dreamed a fairy tale.",969235200,,2980,4.821782178217822

My favorite Disney film until The  Rescuers was released is still a favorite of mine. The animation is  spectacular & the villin Malificent is the most evil and terrifing  Disney villin ever. The story takes place in a magical medievil kingdom  where King Stephan & his Queen have just been given the gift of a baby  which they named Aurora. During the celbration of her birth the three good  faries Flora, Fauna, & Merryweather bestow gifts upon the tiny  princess. But before Merryweather can say her gift the evil fariy  Malificent crashes the party she then places a curse upon the child that  before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she shall prick her finger on  a spinning wheel & die.
After she vanishes Merryweather gives her  gift that when her finger does prick the spindle of the spinning wheel that  instead of dying she will fall into sleep which only true loves first kiss  will awaken her. The three faries then decide to bring up the young  princess in the forest until after her birthday. Sworn off magic & a  new name for the princess (Rose) as the only means to her protection. Rose  is strictly forbiddon to talk to strangers but when she meets Prince  Phillip in the forest she falls in love not knowing that he is the prince  she is to be married to. When Malificent finds the princess she has to use  all her powers in order to put Aurora to sleep and keep Phillip from  finding her.

No, not like the moments at the beginning of Beauty  and the Beast, but really a sort of 2-dimensional color-saturated eye  candy.  And I mean that in the most positive way!
Yes, the characters  move with all the grace of any Disney animation.  But the overall  impression I got was of gothic illuminated texts, or stained glass  windows.....you get what I mean.
This was something original and  refreshing, an animated ""look"" that was not merely consistent  from one artist to another but in concept itself.
