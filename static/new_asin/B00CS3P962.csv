8585524,1,B00CS3P962,This movie is a total waste of money - it was so bad I watched a little over half of it and could not bear to watch anymore because of the bad acting and it ended up in the trash can.  Not only was it badly written but the acting is BEYOND HORRIBLE.  This is by far one of the worst movies I ever picked up and it was promptly put in the trash where it belongs.  If you want to throw away your money get this movie.,1376956800,3,415,3.6931818181818183
8585525,1,B00CS3P962,"Richard (Rudolph Moise) is a successful lawyer who is going to marry Nadine (Kenya Moore). He breaks the news to his Haitian girlfriend Florence (Kia Samuel), who does not take it all that well. After she shoots up the wedding, gets out of jail, she vows to kill them both.

The film starts out like a poorly scripted, badly acted, low budget African-American film. Director Kenya Moore did a marvelous job maintaining that consistency throughout the film which picks up about 55 minutes into the feature.

This is not a horror story and far from an action thriller. It is a poor drama with badly written characters. Not worth a Redbox rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Nice cleavage Kenya.",1376352000,5,707,4.778688524590164
