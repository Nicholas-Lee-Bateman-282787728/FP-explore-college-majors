684247,1,6303593135,"While Godard's classic, breathless, is undeniably one of the greatest films ever made, the version released from the International Film Series is nearly unwatchable.  It is terribly overexposed, washing out much of the picture detail, and making most of the white-on-white subtitles impossible  to read.  In addition, (I am unsure if this is unique to my particular  copy) the video tends to ghost, and in places appears pink with a moving  vertical (this is definately not a tracking problem, rather a glitch with  the copy of the film this tape was recorded from).  I would recommend this  film to anyone, however it might be best to purchase the other version.",953424000,25,663,4.963636363636364
684248,5,6303593135,"This is one of the most refreshingly entertaining french movies of all time. While ground-breaking in it's use of editing, the movie is also refreshingly original in it's story (by Francois Truffaut). Jean Paul  Belmondo is the embodiment of 'coolness' as the anti-hero Michel Poiccard,  even if he is a 'small-time' hood. Jean Seberg is beautiful as his 'cute'  american love interest. While it may not appeal to the general public, film  lovers and insiders will be delighted. Great for sophisticated viewers. One  of the all-time greats.

684453,3,6303593135,"I wasn't sure whether to give this one two or three stars, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Technically I don't think there is any innovation in Breathless that isn't in John Cassavetes Shadows (released several months earlier than Godards film), except perhaps the jump cuts, which are no longer fashionable. On a deeper level, it is possible to care about, and believe in, the story and characters in Shadows, but not about the ones in Godards film, who are caricatures and not believable at all. The ostensibly lively and spontaneous young women played by Jeanne Moreau in Jules and Jim and Jean Seberg in Breathless are no match for Lelia Goldoni in Cassavetes Shadows or Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence. In this film, Seberg acts like Belmondos murder of a cop is about as disturbing to her as if he had refused to pay a parking ticket. Belmondos character was presumably meant to be flat and emotionless, but Sebergs character provides no real contrast; despite constantly going on about Chopin, Mozart, and Faulkner, she never displays any real feeling. The hype around this film (and other films by Godard and Truffaut) has obscured much of what is truly great in French cinema  films like The Wages of Fear, Jacques Tatis Playtime, La belle noiseuse, Kassovitzs La haine, or the work of Sylvain Chomet and Tony Gatlif.",1440806400,2,1346,4.776824034334764

684542,5,6303593135,"This film was made in 60s and many years later as I was getting intrigued by the director Godard, I saw bits and pieces of it and knew that it is a classic film that created a new way of making films.  It also features Jean Paul Belmondo.  Let me just say that my mother and (European) women of her generation loved this actor and the only other actor that competed for their devotion was actor Marlon Brando.

Film is made in Paris and it is a story of a young man, con-artist who makes his living stealing cars, until one day while caught in his act and he ends up killing a policemen.  In his attempt to avoid prison, he decides to return to Paris and find friends who can help him raise money so he can make his escape to Rome, Italy.  A con-man that he is, he lacks no shortage of women who adore him and are willing to do anything to please him.  But there is a young American student, unconventional girl with a short hair and (French) American accent that catches his heart.  Both are young and are on the crossroads of defining their future and their lives.  They also are exploring love for each other.  It is obvious that there is strong sexual energy between them, but can cultural and social differences make up for the gap in their intellectual strength?  There is almost a notion that young man's predicament is a test of their love.  Do they love each other that they will stay together until the end of their days on earth, or is it a kind of love where ""if I cannot have you, no one else will"" that ends in tragedy?

The very end of film is what captures viewers attention.  Could it be that roles of who is in love with whom change at that very moment?  Godard is challenging idea of how far the act of betrayal has to go before we as human beings are able to acknowledge the true feelings we have for another person?  All that we know is when things go too far, we are left to face the consequences that mark the rest of our life, or the beginning of our death.  Perhaps some acts of betrayal are nothing but the death itself - there is a breath in our body, but the soul is damaged beyond repair.

I absolutely loved quotes from Faulkner and other writers used in this film during conversation between the two lovers.  It must have been gutsy to have something like that in the movie that was made in 1960.  Yes - Godard was a genius.",1427328000,,2355,4.216517857142857

Highly Recommended.",1413072000,,381,4.815384615384615
684609,4,6303593135,"A key film of the late Fifties/early Sixties French New Wave,  BOUT DE SOUFFLE (Breathless) opens with suave lowlife Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) stealing a car. When he's caught speeding on the way to Paris and pursued by the police, Michel kills the officer. Desperate to collect some money owed and make his escape to Italy, he hides out with Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American girl he had slept with once and who is oblivious to the danger he's in.

This is one of the most influential films of all time in its liberal use of jump cuts, in idolizing American noir films and transferring that aesthetic to a foreign country, and its allusions to other films and even self-referentially to itself. Goddard left plenty of signs that he was seeking to overturn the staid French mainstream tradition, such as when Michel rebuffs a hawker selling ""Cahiers du cinema"" (the French film magazine), or when Patricia interviews a film director named Parvulesco, who is none other than Godard's New Wave comrade-in-arms Jean-Pierre Melville.

 BOUT DE SOUFFLE is undeniably dated. Even knowing all that context around its creation and reception, I found it hard to be really bowled over and cannot award the film a full five stars. Still, there's a lot to like. I'm particularly fond of the film's dialogue, which revels in French slang that hitherto had not been consider ""proper"" for art, most of which goes over Patricia's head and some of which Michel explains. In that sense one might compare the film to Raymond Queneau's novel ""Zazie dans le mtro"" from the same time. Criterion's English subtitles deal with it not through literal translations but by trying to find analogous English slang. The sexual frankness of its young characters might surprise younger viewers who would place this social upheaval to later in the 1960s.

I watched Criterion's one-disc DVD version of the film, missing out on the extras that came with the two-disc DVD edition or the Blu-ray. While customers today might want to go straight for the Blu-ray, those buying from the used market for cheap need not pass up the DVD, as the transfer isn't bad at all.",1408233600,,2142,4.889807162534435
684610,2,6303593135,"There is no ""real"" plot or action, and the dialogue is corny and inarticulate. The only suspense was wondering whether Jean Paul Belmondo was going to smoke himself to death before the cops shot him. Belmondo's chain smoking for an hour and a half is not an artistic accomplishment. Considering Belmondo's cigarette consumption, the movie was properly titled, Breathless.",1405728000,2,371,5.305084745762712

It's a very stylish black and white film about a thief, played by Jean-Paul Belmondo, who wanders through Paris trying to find the man who owes him money. He's on the run from the cops, and in love with a beautiful journalist.

My problem with the film is that the plot is very weak. It's got a lot of influential cinematic shots, and the use of very long tracking takes is really great, but the movie's plot struggles to move forward. Another big problem with the film is the excessive use of ""Jump Cuts."" The continuity is all over the place, as the movie jumps from one cut to something else entirely.

While maybe not sublime, this film is wonderfully entertaining, and for what it's intentions were it is a masterpiece, too well thought out and executed.

684661,5,6303593135,"Breathless is a film that leaves you just that; it is a brisk 90something minute journey that rarely slows down, delivering an exhilarating experience through both its narrative and its filmic style.

Godard's first film follows a man on the run, after committing a murder in rural France, who reunites with a former flame, an American reporter. The two are both the pursuers and the pursued, whose roles constantly shift both among themselves and with their surroundings. The power plays among the two of them are just as compelling as their experiences on the edge of the law.

Through brilliant editing techniques, such as jump cuts and sound continuity, the action unfolds upon the audience with great efficiency and effectiveness. We see the full extent of their actions and their dialogue, quickened by the luxury of jump cuts, eliminating that which is not necessary and heightening the sense of urgency throughout the entire film.

Even when the two are at rest, passing the time in a hotel after being pursued by the authorities, the pace does not slow down, as we witness very well-written conversations between the young lovers. They view life with a cynicism that is somehow fatalistic yet charming, with an authenticity rare to characters with such a negative perspective. It rings as true, not the cliche that it has become in a post-Breathless world.

In addition to its own merits, which are plentiful, Breathless is such an essential viewing due to how influential it has become. Both its formal techniques, of story and script, as well as its informal aspects, such as editing and sound, have paved the way for many modern films. Even among our contemporary cinema, though, Breathless still delivers an exhilarating and truly breathtaking ride.",1372809600,,1762,5.0446735395189
684708,2,6303593135,Most of the reviews for this film stated that it was excellent.  I can't recommend it.  It seemed to drag on forever.  The long conversations - for the sake of only conversation - made the movie seem really long.,1372723200,2,212,4.384615384615385
684709,1,6303593135,"First of all, jump cuts. What's the big deal? I won't waste your time with a detailed negative review. But I do want to mention two or three things: 1) The 26 minute scene between Seberg and Belmondo had me rolling my eyes with boredom.  2) Hearing the glaring Iowa accent of Seberg as she speaks French put me over the edge.  3) Godard apparently abandoned the screenplay,  which is annoyingly obvious. Here's something positive that I will say: There are so many other French films that are so much better and are exciting to watch.  For instance, ""Confidentially Yours,"" ""The Piano Player"" and ""Les Diaboliques"" are just a few that I would recommend.",1371772800,5,653,4.701754385964913
684710,5,6303593135,"Okay, enough with the one-star reviews.  ""Breathless"" has earned its reputation as one of the great, genre-altering films of all time.  Why?  Because of its style.

It's as if director Jean Luc Godard anticipated Marshall McLuhan and Andy Warhol.  In this film, 'the medium is the message', and surface is all that matters.  Attitude is everything.  Godard scrapped all the pretensions of storyline, stereotypical location shots and scene framing, and made a movie that engages the viewer, so he/she feels like one is witnessing something directly.  The movie doesn't give you a dazzling, foreign and aloof picture of Paris-- it gives you a Paris that is warm, immediate, and familiar.  Scenes appear uncontrived, and are allowed to happen, sometimes with ad-libs.  When there is a transition, as in late afternoon to evening, it comes with the flash of the streetlamps igniting in a row.  Simple, and brilliant.

John Paul Belmondo starts the film with a line that Amazon won't allow me to repeat.  Suffice to say, it sets the tone, and is one of the greatest lines ever given to an anti-hero.  Belmondo brings a persona to the film similar to onethat the world would meet a few years later in the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger... charismatic, sophisticated, but cool to the point of uncaring.  Jean Seberg provides an anchor to the film, and an eerie beauty.  She plays a young woman in an experimental stage of her life, like a coed you might find in any dormitory in any college...only slightly more enigmatic.

The camerawork is terrific, and integral to the attitude of the film.  There are many 'nod and wink' moments, as when a cavalcade of motorcycles passes, in arrow formations, left to right.  When a scrolling news message board says ""the suspects capture is imminent"", the audience is naturally briefed that the film is nearly at a close.  It's all about motion, pacing, flow, and just ""being there"".  Godard seemed to be saying, ""You know its a movie, and I know its a movie.  I'll let you in on the joke.""  Moviemaking was never again quite the same.

P.S.  Did I mention that there is a witty, faux-noir jazz score?  And finally, there is the most overacted and tragicomic death stagger in the history of film.  You can watch this movie several times and still feel the same sense of exhilaration, the same clearing of the air.",1370822400,,2342,4.79
684711,1,6303593135,"This is one film I missed during my favorite cinematic era--European films of the 60s--so I was excited that TCM was showing it last night on an otherwise dull TV night. Oh dear. Viewed today, this thing comes across as just one more badly made movie. The famous jump cuts were more like skip cuts; I felt like I was watching a bad copy from which bits had been censored. The famous long scene in Patricia's apartment was boring beyond belief--the result of filmmakers too lazy to bother with a script. Jean Seberg's character was well done, except that it's hard to believe she would be out on the street in jeans and t-shirt hawking the Herald Tribune one day, and the next day be all gussied up to interview a best-selling writer at the airport. A stunning moment of that interview is when Patricia asks the author what his great ambition in life is, and he says that it's to become immortal and then die. We then have a close-up of Patricia's face which now becomes for the viewer Jean Seberg's face with an unforgettable expression, when we think of her suicide. Art and life at this moment intersect most startlingly. I also find what Patricia does at the end of the film to be wonderfully believable and realistic--none of this Bonnie & Clyde stuff for her; she's going to save her own skin.

It broke so many rules, oozed French charm, paid homage to American violence in film, and gave us two young stars. Belmondo in many ways was the first to make debauchery look cool and every new generation to follow attempted to come up with the equivalent to smoking in bed, dressing conventionally but with their own twist on it, and some memorable gesture as Michel did with Bogie' s.

It is a film about the influences of art in general, and the need to strive for an original statement in the face of such art.  It is a love story that transcends the rapid, jump-cut rhytms for which Godard is deservedly famous.  Notice how the film is all movement, action and speed when outside, but slows down to a languid, dream-like pace when Belmondo and Seberg are togehter in the bedroom.

684780,4,6303593135,"Breathless (1960) is considered to be one of the most important examples of French new wave cinema. It is the story of Michel Poiccard a young criminal who is on the run from cops and Patricia, a young American girl aspiring journalist living in Paris and working for New York Heral Tribune Newspaper.

Michelle has immature ways and care-free life style. The movie presents him as a likeable character with his eccentric ways and idiosyncrasies, most famous of which is the thing he does with his thumb over his lips. Jean-Paul Belmond truly brings the character to life. Michelle and Patricia's relationship what really makes the movie. There is a famous sequence shot in a real hotel room. The scene is famous due to its natural atmosphere shot without any lighting, and the fact that the hotel room being very crammy. I also find the dialogues between Michele and Patricia very natural. It is a mixture of sexuality, romance and love and future of a relationship - essentials of what happens between every man and woman.

But what makes the movie famous (or unique) is the ""jump-cuts""; it is a real different way of editing the scenes. The entire sequence is shot, but the parts that slow down the pace are cut-out which make it look like the scene is cutoff and skips forward to the next scene. This gives the movie a unique atmosphere.

Goddard has introduced us to two charismatic actors who are infinitely watchable as they parade around the streets of Paris.  Jean Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, in 1960 Europe, represent a new kind of cool pair as they casually drift around and talk in an open manner not typical of Hollywood films to that point.  Both are fashion statements for a kind of carefree, aimless lifestyle.  Despite the fact that Belmondo's character has killed a policeman he seems relatively unconcerned about it.  Some of the extended scenes, such as the opening car ride and the bedroom scene later on, are meant more for displaying style and facial close-ups than moving the narrative forward.  But I have to admit it was fun to watch these two even if the endless sexual advances and frivolous conversations got a bit tedious.  I liked the flash cuts and how the camera surveyed the city to give the backdrop of the story.  But I never felt like the story had any purpose other than to show off the stars and introduce a new way (or ""wave"") of doing things in cinema.  I loved the natural style of the film, and appreciate how it influenced filmmaking, but the dots never seemed to get connected by the time ""Fin"" rolled around.",1354406400,2,1388,4.582995951417004

684785,5,6303593135,"Jean-Luc Godard intended to shake the delicate world of cinema, that much is obvious. But did he intend to reinvent it? Whether it was his intention or not isn't the point, the point is this; he did. Jean-Luc Godard, and Francois Truffuat are the undisputed fathers of the French New Wave. Some cinephiles or historians may feel like pointing elsewhere, to Jean Renoir for example, protesting that he is truly the father of the French New Wave, I disagree entirely. The French New Wave was a product of the kindred spirits and talents of Godard and Truffaut. And no other film represents the French New Wave more coherently than Jean-Luc Godard's dazzling 1960 picture, 'Breathless'. Unorthodox and uninhibited. Raw and experimental. Godard broke every rule in the book, disavowed the laws of cinema, and scribed a new rule book, one where the pages are blank, and possibilities are endless. The story is so simple I can summarize the entire film in half of a sentence, but I refuse to give you or Godard the satisfaction. What counts in Breathless is not the story, but how the story is told. The very definition of 'cool', the film is robust in creativity, and exuberant in its flaws, and passionate about its reckless behavior. Self aware and rebellious. If there was no Breathless, there would have been no Tarantino, if there was no French New Wave, the streak of genius that ran through the nineties and 2000s wouldn't have existed. Before Breathless, it was believed that films took money, that you had to find yourself in a place of authority to make a film. Breathless broke this misconception. Breathless makes you want to run outside and make the film of your life. Breathless made that possible, Breathless made the amateur the auteur, Breathless reinvented the face of the cinema, and made you believe that could too. All you need is a girl and gun.

Criterion, as usual, have outdone themselves. Buy the discs, read the booklet, watch the feature and the features, and you'll be a Breathless expert in no time!",1351641600,,2024,4.816091954022989

684803,2,6303593135,"I rushed to see this when it came out in 1961 and adored it.  Now I have to wonder why.  Yes, I'm aware that it was a stylistic breakthrough and that we should all offer homage to Godard for that.  But, as other reviewers here have said, that's not enough to make it great film.  Many other break-through films are still enjoyable today but this isn't one of them.

I was enamored of it because I was young and impressionable.  I soon followed in the steps of the Jean Seberg character and went to Paris, enrolled at the Sorbonne and smoked Gauloise.  Fortunately I stayed clear of the creepier types that poor Patricia fell for.  I guess the close shots, the overlapping dialogue and the fact that the characters were so casual about sex were part of the attraction for me---remember this was the very beginning of the 60's and I was from the Midwest, not far from Jean Seberg's home, actually.  (I knew someone who went to  church camp with her in Iowa.)

But, gee, this time around, the glamour of that lifestyle had long since tarnished.  I'm still vulnerable to anything French ----I just re-viewed and re-loved ""Shoot the Piano Player"" but this one failed to hold anything to interest me.  The petty thief who is supposed to be sexy....well he wasn't.  His habit of rubbing his mouth, a la Bogart, was just pretentious and stupid.  The conversation in her bedroom...was beyond the pale...We're supposed to find that kind of drivvel interesting?

Well....chacun a son gout...And there are many who will attempt to love this film because they are told that they should.  For those who really want good crime films of the time, search out the ones by Jean-Pierre Melville, who had a cameo in this one.  He loved amoral characters, dark Paris streets and big American cars, too, but somehow his films held together, have the substance that this one really lacks.

I continue to love other Nouvelle Vague Films of the era, especially those of Truffaut and Malle, both of whom have a humanism that Godard never had.",1328054400,8,2015,4.657223796033994

Also, the film is in mono, aided by Dolby Digital.  I can see how the film is loved by most film connoisseurs but I'm not overly impressed.  First of all Jean-Paul Belmondo as Michel seems over his head.  I remember when I was 17 or thereabouts, I tried one of those French cigarettes (Gauloises).  It made Camels seem like candy.  It reminded me of Michel chain smoking what appeared to be a homemade doobie throughout the movie.  I digress.  I didn't like him or Belmondo.  On the other hand I loved Jean Seberg as Patricia, an American student and wannabe journalist.  She falls for Michel in spite of his obvious criminal activities.  She must wrestle with the idea of staying with him or pursuing her career.

What really impressed me was the ""surprise"" ending with the enigmatic actions of Seberg's character at the end which made me laugh when I realised that she fooled us all along and that the naive American girl was actually the most cunning and totally self-serving (others may consider it just being realistic) character of all.  It was obvious from the start that Seberg never really loved the Belmondo character and in fact she was trying to get rid of him but like a rash that wouldn't go away she simply tolerated him knowing that it wasn't wise to upset a murderous gangster and when she saw a chance to get away from him and from his manipulating her into agreeing to go on a trip to Rome with him when she clearly preferred to continue studying at the Sorbonne at least for me all her actions made a lot of sense in the end.  Beware the naive and innocent looking as they may just turn out to be the very opposite.  In fact, the Belmondo character was on the outside what the Seberg character was on the inside and vice versa: remarkable!

The End."" Black Adder, quite rightly, deems it ""completely and utterly awful."" Now imagine if the intellectuals of the day heralded Baldrick's manuscript as one of the best novels ever written, and it appeared constantly on critics' All-Time-Top-Ten lists.

This is not the first Criterion Collection DVD I have purchased that has had technical issues. In this movie, the entire bedroom scene where our two protagonists chat in bed was uninterpretable on this DVD due to the fact that the subtitles went by in a single frame flash. I thought: is this intended to be subliminal? Because that's about all I was getting. I don't speak french and couldn't read the subtitles, and the scene went on too long for me to simply enjoy two lovely humans rolling around together. Last time I saw this movie, in about 1979, I think it had the same problem. I would have thought that it would have been fixed for this release.

The movie itself is of interest in that it represented a break from traditional films and moviemaking. Even now, the casual nature of the protagonists love affair is a bit shocking, and the nihilistic approach to life that the main characters display is oh so stylized. But I loved looking at it and enjoyed the cat-and-mouse with the Inspector. The jazz music score is funny to us now but it still a great counterpoint to the action.

If you like perfomance pieces this is the movie for you. if you're more of a fast pace, story driven flick then I recomend you something else like The third man. This movie is perhaps better view as a breakthrough in style and an indipendent crittic at the films from that time. This movie is the answer to the question Can we make a movie outside the studio ruled-hollywood-track mentality? and coud this be art? the answer my friend is: yes.

684873,2,6303593135,"""Breathless"" is a French film made in 1960, and it is a great departure from what I had expected.  It was different, but did not appeal to me because it seemed a mumbo-jumbo of a film.  The script seemed like it was pieced together out of newspaper clippings as dialogue was chopped and all over the map.

The movie opens up with a young thief, Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo) stealing a car and eventually shooting a cop.  He runs from the crime and steals a car to get to Paris and shacks up with Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American who sells the New York Herald Tribune International on the streets of Paris.  Michel hides out in her hotel room while trying to sell Patricia on a plan to go with him to Italy.  She soon realizes that includes a journey into criminal life, which is overwhelming.

The film is in black and white, with subtitles.  The conversations are constantly cut and pasted throughout, you feel you are hearing just parts of conversation.  The thief, Michel, is a bit odd in all his car-jacking and running around like a cartoon figure at times.

It is full of prattlings on life and goals, and some scenes go on forever with close-ups of the lovely Jean Seberg.  It seemed to be a film to frame her talents and beauty, but frustrating in weak plot and abrupt scene changes.

Its director,Jean-Luc Godard,was part of the nouvelle vague,including Truffaut, Melville,Chabrol,Rivette and Rhomer. This was Godard's debut-formerly a Cahiera du Cinema critic-,still looking so fresh and modern,the epitome of cinematic invention, vitality and cool.

Chabrol,who served as supervising producer on `Breathless',famously warned that great subjects rarely make great films. And Godard gnomically said:""All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.""This was the basis of the brief scenario that Truffaut,an admirer of film noire and pulp fiction,provided for Breathless. The couple talk of lifeand literature in a seedy hotel,make love and visit the movies while he tries to get money owed to him by criminal associates. The police close in,Patricia betrays him. The style is everything,a calculated destruction and remaking of traditional film grammar. The camera is hand-held,the editing is abrupt and inconsistent.

He evokes other directors,Fuller,Preminger,Aldrich and Bogart's image looms. We are kept at a distance by Brecht's alienation effect,told that we are watching a film,but also that movies,like our lives are halls of mirrors.

684875,5,6303593135,"Every director has their beginning but for Jean-Luc Godard, his 1960 film ""&Agrave; bout de souffle"" a.k.a. ""Breathless"" was the beginning of a cinema revolution and bringing the world closer to nouvelle vague, the French New Wave.

Godard is a unique director who attracted attention for his innovative editing and his use of jump cuts, his style of not giving his talent a script until the morning of and using improvisation and utilizing film techniques that most directors would never do.  In fact, his filmmaking even infuriated his producer because instead of using a full day to shoot a film, sometime he was in the mood to do only 12 minutes.  But then again, Jean-Luc Godard is not your typical director and in 1960, no one knew what to expect from him.

Many looked at him as a rebel as he wanted to challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood cinema and for those who watched his films evolve year after year, the more we get to see Godard in his characters but also his political ideologies as well.

But ""Breathless"" was a film that helped change cinema.  For decades, many followed the Hollywood tradition and sure, Jean Renoir did something unique and special decades earlier with ""The Rules of the Game""  (unfortunately, no one at the time was ready for the film until three decades later and people acknowledge that his film was ahead of its time) but it was ""Breathless"" that inspired young directors and showed them that directors, auteurs can do something different.

From the use of jump cuts to capturing Paris with a hidden camera, the film and its director was hailed for its innovation and it was the beginning of the French New Wave.  Interesting enough, although the film made Jean-Luc Godard a popular name, the director himself was not as thrilled by all the attention and popularity of ""Breathless"" that led him to create ""Le Petit Soldat"" (The Little Soldier) which was highly political and banned in France for three years.  Regardless of whether or not Godard enjoyed the success of the film, the film was unique and an inspiration to many filmmakers.

For over 40 decades, ""Breathless"" has been regarded as a film that cinema fans must watch and eventually own and in 2007, The Criterion Collection released ""Breathless"" in a 2-disc DVD set (with a slipcase cover) and booklet.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Breathless"" is presented in black and white in its original aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  The film looks absolutely great and the Criterion Collection once again does a wonderful job with the transfer.  According to Criterion, the transfer is approved by director of photography Raoul Coutard.  The new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm fine-grain master positive. Thousand of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.

As for audio, the audio is in French Monaural and was mastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical track print, and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The Dolby Digital 1.0 is clear and understandable but for a more immersive soundtrack, I chose to have my home theater receiver set with audio on all channels.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For anyone interested in French New Wave films, ""Breathless"" is a film that is recommended watching.  It's a film that changed cinema and launched the career of director Jean-Luc Godard.

What I loved about the film is the acting.  The whole 25-minute improvisation scene in the bedroom is incredible.  I've learned through the special features that the scene involved Godard yelling and instructing the Belmondo and Seberg on what to do and also learned that the jump cut scenes were accidental but yet made the film quite creative, unique and artistic.

But is it one of the best Godard films?  This is difficult to answer because personally, there are so many Godard films that I do enjoy but yet this is his first and is an important film in his career. But the problem is, to enjoy Godard films is to know Godard films.  You appreciate his films, the more you watch several of them and learn his unique style of filmmaking.

Also, the film has been given so much credit for its innovation that so many people come to the film expecting something like Orson Welles ""Citizen Kane"" or a film that with this groundbreaking story and people who experience this Godard film are perplexed and don't understand what the big deal is. And I think that is what has perplexed Godard after the success of the film.  Godard was very critical of the film to the point that he distanced himself from it and thus created the film ""Le Petit Soldat"".

But as mentioned, to enjoy Godard is to know Godard and that is watching his films and learning about them.  Fortunately, The Criterion Collection does a fantastic job with this release of ""Breathless"" in presentation and also its content.  Not only do you get the film but you get to see the various interviews with the talent, interviews with those who worked with him and easily enough, different interpretations of what people got from the film.  The 1993 documentary ""Chamber 12, Hotel de Suede"" is a magnificent addition to the film as we get to see and hear from those who are involved with ""Breathless"", giving us some insight to Godard and his unique filmmaking style.

As far as my enjoyment of the film, I absolutely enjoyed it!  Godard and Belmondo had a magical partnership during their short time together and as for Jean Seberg, this is an actress that had a bad experience  in her earlier years as an actress, given a chance in ""Breathless"" (and worked once more with Godard) and had a rollercoaster of a career that ended in tragedy.  If there was one positive, she is immortalized through her role as Patricia in this film.

""Breathless"" is a film about two different people, their words and what they mean are different, they talk about themselves but yet never really talk to each other.  Are they even listening to each other?  Do they even care for each other?

There's no doubt that one can rewatch ""Breathless"" and see something different each time.  May it be the two talking about paintings, the two talking about Faulkner, this dialogue between the two is something that I found so enjoyable (as I have with Eric Rohmer's moral tale ""My Night at Maud's"" with also a magnificent, smart and enjoyable long bedroom dialogue scene).  There is something about the tone about the film that is just so enchanting.

Despite Michel being the uncaring young bad guy, somehow you can't help but be intrigued by his character.  He's a dangerous man but yet Patricia is even more dangerous in some ways.  Compared to other films showing around the world during its time, ""Breathless"" was fresh, unique and different from what was seen in traditional cinema.

Cinematography for ""Breathless"" is absolutely beautiful.  Because timing and space was a concern, Godard elected to use a wheelchair to film.  Not wanting to use expensive lighting, Godard wanted to capture a realistic feel of these two characters by using natural light.  So, many different techniques employed in this film.

In fact, when they were seen in public, cinematographer Coutard was hidden in a cart as the two are seen walking down the street.  No one around the two actors are aware that the scene was being filmed.  And of course, I go back to the jump scenes and the editing but accidental as it may be, it was definitely a major part in introducing the world to nouvelle vague and changing the scope of cinema.

If you are a Godard fan or a cinemaphile, ""Breathless"" is an important film worth owning in your film collection.  Is it Godard's best film?  For me, I enjoy ""Band of Outsiders"", ""Pierrot le fou"" and ""Mascullin Feminin"" even more.  But in the context of importance, ""Breathless"" is the feature film that launched Godard's career and for that, I'm so grateful that The Criterion Collection gave fans a magnificent release for this film.

Highly recommended!",1265328000,4,9881,4.956231003039513
684876,5,6303593135,"Choosing between this 1960 origional or the 1980s Richard Gere version of Breatless, it is this, no contest.

This is arguabley the first French New Wave film, and contains the ingrediants. Lots of jump cuts, ten minute shots, uniuqe camara angles.
Watch the scene where Belmondo steals the car, or where he is in the room with Jean Seaberg, where the same shot is held for the whole dialouge, panning camara.

Breathless is a pretty simple crime film: steel car, accidental murder, elude police, romantic interest. But it is the way that Godard uses film technique to tell the story that makes it work. You see a old stroy told in a fresh way.

These shooting and editing techniques are now used constantly on TV to make the medium look hip, but in 1960, these were truely experimental and enhanced the STORY. Godard remebered here, story came first.",1259798400,,851,4.736486486486487
684877,5,6303593135,"Jean-Luc Godard has been credited with revitalizing cinema in the early 60's with his interesting and unique style of filmmaking, a style that has bleed over into even modern cinema and continues to influence and inspire.  To say that Jean-Luc Godard is one of the greatest directors of all time (in company with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Ingmar Bergman) is perhaps too simple.  The fact remains that Godard isn't simply one of the best, he's one of the most important.  `A Bout de Souffle' (better known as `Breathless') is a sublime example of why he is so important.  With his debut feature film he stunned audiences and critics alike by breathing a breath of fresh air into cinema and creating something new and intriguing and completely entertaining.

`A Bout de Souffle' is one of those films you have to be wary about `over-praising' because once you `get' it you totally fall head over heals for it, but until you `get' it you may find yourself baffled at all the praise.  That was me upon my initial viewing.  I was about halfway into the film and I was stumped as to why this movie was so well loved.  Sure, it was stylistically exuberating and blatantly original in construction, but as far as being a great `movie', well, I just wasn't `feeling' it in that way.  The third act though is a huge wallop to the viewer and completely changed my thinking on the entire film.  In fact, upon my second viewing I was able to spot things throughout the films progression that only added to my admiration for it, and now I am completely and utterly in love with the film; so much so that I consider it one of the best ever made.

So, I don't want to raise your expectations so much that you become dumbfounded in the films first and second act.  Please, realize that my praise belongs to the film in its entirety, and entirety that cannot be fully appreciated until the third act is through.  You really need to judge the film on your second viewing, for it is only after you have put all the pieces together that you can really enjoy the film from start to finish.

The film is part crime noir, part romantic thriller.  It centers around a thug named Michel who is on the run after killing a police officer.  He hides out in his American girlfriend's apartment.  The film sports a neurotic narrative that keeps the audience glued as Michel and Patricia (the girlfriend) go through their day as normal people in abnormal circumstances.  The performances are fresh and believable, and the dialog (a lot of which was adlibbed) feels perfect for the situation.  Godard brings a lot of his love for film into his construction of `A Bout de Souffle', a film that can be seen as an ode to the great film noirs that came before it.  What is remarkable is that, but making this film completely his own, Godard created an ode that is superior to the films he was praising.

During a press conference with an author, Jean Seberg's character Patricia asks the author ""what is your greatest ambition in life"" to which he responds, after much thought, ""to become immortal and then to die"".  The significance of this statement is seen, not only in this film, but in the idea that art makes the artist immortal.  Godard has become immortal.  In the context of the film though, the immortality comes from love.  When one has become truly loved then they are in essence `immortal'.

The question raised at the end of this film is, `was Michel immortal?'

Through Godard's impressive way of telling a story within a story one really has to watch this film a few times to answer that question.  The outcome with each viewing may be different than the last, and the fact that Godard keeps the answer an ambiguity is to the films advantage.  Did Patricia really love Michel?  Was her emotional reaction to the films conclusion all just an act?  Piecing together Godard's point of view may reveal an answer you least expect, which makes this film all the more captivating.  The films production notes mention that Patricia commits the ultimate act of betrayal; but exactly what that act is, is up to the audience to decide.",1251417600,,4115,4.6098901098901095
684878,4,6303593135,"The Bottom Line:

Breathless reminds me of the Blair Witch Project (bet I'm the first person to ever say that) in that looking back it's hard to see what all the fuss was about--Breathless was extraordinarily novel for its time but now it's a far less compelling motion picture, so if you sit down to watch it you might find a find far less masterful than you were lead to believe.

684879,4,6303593135,"Viewing this is surprisingly fresh:  all of the protagonists are evident mediocrities and even rather silly.  While they use fashionable vocabulary and ""all the right moves"", they are basically stupid and headed nowhere.

So you get a petty thief, forced to act at extremes and hidden in Paris to get money owed to him, so that he can escape to Italy.  He has a string of GFs to exploit, and seeks to find one willing to help him in Paris, after another has apparently given him up to the cops after helping him to steal a car in Marseilles (the pathetic motive of all his crimes).  He finds one, a lovely American would-be journalist (Seeburg, who was to make a career in Paris, marry novelist Roman Gary and later commit suicide), whom he uses in the crudest self-serving manner.  She obliges, to a point, for unbelievably laughable reasons that are surely meant as satire in her stilted dialogue.

The ending, nonetheless, is anything but expected, which in so many ways is the essence of New Wave realism.  I hugely enjoed watching this unfold, even though I had seen this when I first came to Paris.  I think it is a classic, though it has aged only medium well.

Recommended.  Goddard is worth the effort, and the acting is good, however insipid the characters are by design.  It is fun, you see Paris at the beginning of the 1960s, and the ironies - including the unbelievably stale interview by Seeburg character, with a writer at the airport, made while she was harboring an evil fugitive - are well worth the price of admission.  But far better was yet to come in subsequent films.",1237161600,,1591,4.599290780141844

On the surface, it seems like a standard young couple-on-the-run adventure, but Godard upends the predictability of the situation with a fresh, documentary-style perspective that emphasizes youthful impulses over morality lessons. Some of its fresh, brazen novelty has worn off over the years, but there is no denying its propulsive energy.

The plot is deceptively simple. Michel Poiccard is a young, small-time criminal with a Bogart fixation, living for the moment and taking what he needs with no consideration for the possible consequences. His one obsession is Patricia Franchini, a pixyish New Yorker who lives in Paris and works part-time for the New York Herald Tribune. Michel steals a car in Marseilles and drives to Paris to see her again. On the way, however, he shoots a motorcycle cop with a gun found in the glove compartment of the stolen car. As the police close in on Michel, he holes up in Patricia's apartment and tries to convince her to run away with him to Rome. Godard wrote the script based on a story by Truffaut, and the plot emphasis is placed squarely on the dynamic between Michel and Patricia, especially in a lengthy dialogue scene in her apartment. The thriller aspects seem secondary until the last half-hour and the memorably bitter ending.

In his breakthrough role, Jean-Paul Belmondo captures Michel's surly, amoral nature with a certain magnetic quality that announces his arrival. As the fashionably enigmatic Patricia, Jean Seberg was just 21 but had already been burned by Hollywood thanks to her mechanical performances in two Otto Preminger films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saint-Joan/dp/B000AMCCLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saint Joan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bonjour-Tristesse/dp/B0000E5NPZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bonjour Tristesse</a>. She still strikes me a blank slate here, but it seems to work for the story because the viewer is left wondering what motivates her devotion to him and her final act of absolution. The two-disc 2007 Criterion Collection DVD set is as impressive as expected for the film's aficionados. Beyond a fairly pristine print of the movie, Disc One includes the original French trailer and 27-minutes worth of vintage interviews with Godard, Belmondo, Seberg, and director Jean-Pierre Melville (who has a memorable cameo as a pretentious author.

Disc Two has the lion's share of the extras. There are recent interviews with Coutard and assistant director Pierre Rissient, as well as a ten-minute interview with documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker and his brief experience working with Godard. Seberg gets special attention in an eighteen-minute film essay that covers her tragic life and career, and another essay, ""Breathless as Criticism"" has Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum explaining the significance of the film for a new generation. There is a 78-minute documentary from 1993, ""Chambre 12, Hotel de Suede"" that traces the original film locales. Interviews with Belmondo, Coutard, and technical adviser Claude Chabrol are also included.

Jean Luc Godard was one of several filmmakers who felt that movies were getting stale, so he attempted to rejuvinate the medium.

Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) kills a cop after stealing a car. He overreacted but now needs to play it cool to avoid detection. He is a wanted man, but he steals cars left and right and persues a beautiful American girl (Jean Seberg) instead of fleeing the country. She is ambivalent about him, but the two spend a lot of time together. Their conversations are the most enjoyable parts of the movie, especially the one in her apartment.

A simple movie that sometimes feels like sneaking into a stranger's conversation, Breathless is highly enjoyable. It was made on a modest budget, but it comes off as being slick and interesting.

684932,5,6303593135,"""A Bout de Souffler,"" (""Breathless"")1960, a French crime drama/romance/thriller was the first of the ""Nouvelle Vogue""(""New Wave"") films - made by a school of filmmakers associated with the noted French cinema  enthusiasts' magazine ""Cahiers du Cinema--"" principally Jean Luc Godard, and Francois Truffaut, among others.  Truffaut wrote the script; Godard directed; it was his first film.  It starred the ""jolie-laid,"" (beautiful-ugly) Jean-Paul Belmondo, making his film debut as Michel Poiccard/Laszlo Kovacs, a petty thief-cop killer.  And the stunningly beautiful Jean Seberg, then 21, as Patricia Franchini, a seemingly aimless American girl taking classes at Paris's famed university, the Sorbonne, selling The New York Herald Tribune International Edition along the City's equally famed shopping street, the Champs Elysee.  It introduced techniques that were to become commonplace: hand-held cameras, jump cuts, a cool jazz soundtrack, as it told its story, filmed on the streets of Paris for less than $50,000: even then a bargain basement price.

In plot, actually, it could be a typical B crime thriller of the 1930's or 40's; Poiccard kills the cop in the first few minutes of the film -we're never quite sure why; thereafter, he just wants to raise enough money to flee to Italy with Patricia; who doesn't wish to go, and will eventually take steps to assert her independence.  Poiccard is much more self-aware than an earlier generation of filmic criminals were; he's a great admirer of Humphrey Bogart; constantly trying on the mannerisms of that iconic actor.  It's not easy to sympathize with him; yet we eventually do, to some extent.

""Breathless"" is widely considered a great, groundbreaking film, and so it is.  But my relationship with it is a little different than most people: I first saw it upon its initial release, as a college freshman.  Someone once remarked that great books we read when we are young serve as lighthouses: casting their light forward on where we will eventually go.  Well, for me, actually, it was movies rather than books, that illuminated the way forward, and ""Breathless"" was surely a lighthouse for me.  Was it the coolness of the characters?  Their ironic, disaffected viewpoints?  For sure, the two leads are portrayed as shallow and vain, yet the movie spoke to something in the young woman I was; wish I could put my finger on it.  So  ""Breathless"" is no longer technically groundbreaking, of course, but hopefully it can still serve as a lighthouse for those coming upon it for the first time.",1210291200,2,2547,5.158150851581508
684933,3,6303593135,"I was actually looking forward to watching ""Breathless"" but it was certainly a disappointment for me.  This is the story of a man who is going nowhere and who doesn't seem to care too much about what happens along the way.  Yes, he had momentary interests and vague notions of where he would like to be tommorrow and maybe as far into the future as next week.  However, we are given 90 minutes to marvel at his chain-smoking, car-stealing, pick-pocketing self absorbed life.  He has friends in the underworld who show up on occassion and he has a string of girl friends for whom he shows up on occassion.  No one is immune to his manipulation; not even the poor cab driver who got stiffed for the fare.  I got tired of his pointless, hedonistic thievery (not to mention murder).

This movie is highly rated so the problem may well be me.  Maybe it's meant to portray a new Lost Generation in Europe but all the more reason to pity the once great continent.  It may be a brilliant look at a lone wolf's inability to exist in modern society but why empathize with a person who goes to excessive means to avoid assimulating?  This is one of those movies where the dialogue doesn't fit the action.  Murder, thievery, manipulation all takes place with a script that sounds like a college sophomore's intellectual efforts to seduce a coed.  I'm not sure I'm cut out for Godard.

684938,5,6303593135,"Earlier commentators have quite rightly praised the excellence of the technical quality in this film's transfer to DVD and the general distinction as well of the included special features. Outstanding among the latter is the insightful discussion of the film not only in the usual context of its homage to Hollywood noir but of its not so readily recognized role as an art work in the lengthy tradition of ""the international theme,"" that of the naive young American girl adrift among money-hungry Europeans, a favorite of numerous artists since Henry James' ""Daisy Miller.""

""Breathless,"" it's true, has always been rightly understood as a tribute to Monogram Pictures, B movies, and Bogie, but it is equally illuminating to see it as a satirically meaningful interaction between a psychotic, though charming, evil European and a presumably naive, though even more lethal, American girl. Henry James predicted in despair that the American girl of the future would know ""little of mystery, and even less of manners."" In confirmation of his prediction,, we have in this film the American girl in the person of the deadly careerist, ultimate betrayer Patricia, seller of the New York Herald Tribune, speaker of grotesquely pronounced French, herself a species of unwitting last Mohican, the reductio ad absurdam in fact of the presumably innocent American encountering the presumably wicked European. The film ""Breathless, thus, is much more than a piece of meaningless ""existential"" viciousness celebrating the merits of film noir. It is rife with more literary and cultural resonance - to wit, the clever yet moving arrival at rock bottom of an old tradition - than is usually acknowledged.",1193788800,2,1689,5.2555555555555555
684978,5,6303593135,"First off, if you consider yourself any kind of film buff and if you haven't seen Breathless, shame on you.  Not only is it #1 on my personal favorite films life, but i also consider it one of the 5 most important films ever made in cinema history.  In short, it is a film worth owning on DVD.

I had been petitioning for Criterion to release this title in their collection for years and it finally happened-- Breathless has been done justice.  And I must say that my expectations for this Criterion release were greatly surpassed; it is by far the best Criterion DVD i own.

Amazon seems to agree with the release's quality as it has ranked this edition of Breathless as 94 in their Essential 100 DVD's.

Here's what makes this release so good:

+ The new transfer.  beautiful.  it is clear and the image has excellent contrast.  i noticed details in the film that i had never noticed before in my crusty Fox-Lorber edition.  Same goes for the sound transfer.

+ Packaging.  I love the box are and packaging.  the 2-disc set comes with a pretty thick book of essays and interviews that are all very informative and examine the film from a number of perspectives.

+ Special Features.  I don't know of any other dvd release of a classic film that has such comprehensive special features.  i had considered myself somewhat of an authority on breathless... that is until i watched every available feature on this edition and realized that there was so much i didn't know!  although all of the features are great, the best one was the documentary, Chambre 12, Hotel de Suede, an 80 minute piece that if probably the most comprehensive body of info on the film that ive ever come across.

I highly recommend this new release.  In my opinion, you cant go wrong with this film, or with this definitive DVD release.",1193702400,16,1808,4.555900621118012

684980,1,6303593135,"Breathless (Jean-Luc Godard, 1959)

After seeing Pierrot le Fou, finding it awful, and then reading Roger Ebert's recent revised review of it (""...while I once wrote of it as Godard's most virtuoso display of his mastery of Hollywood genres,"" I now see it more as the story of silly characters who have seen too many Hollywood movies."" Ebert, 16Aug07), I thought that perhaps I'd just picked a bad Godard movie to start with, and went for the one that everyone and his mother loves: Breathless, Godard's first film, about which Ebert has famously said ""Modern movies begin here..."". And that may well be true. Recognizing that it is seminal, however, does not make it any less boring.

I re-read Ebert's 2003 analysis of the film just before beginning to write this review, and I'm certainly not going to quibble with any of the points he makes there. Of course not; they're all absolutely true. ""You cannot even begin to count the characters played by Pacino, Beatty, Nicholson, Penn, who are directly descended from Jean-Paul Belmondo's insouciant killer Michel."" Indeed. If I'm reading Ebert (and watching the film) correctly, Breathless is a sort of anti-noir. It has most of the elements of a good noir; a doomed protagonist (Belmondo), a hauntingly lovely femme fatale (Otto Preminger protege Jean Seberg), murder and mayhem, some fun cameos (the one scene in this movie I really loved was the press conference with noir genius Jean-Pierre Melville), the whole lot. Put this in America and give it to, say, Billy Wilder, and wow.

But Wilder did not make it; Jean-Luc Godard did. Autant-Lara said of this film that ""...a minor producer hired a minor director to make a minor crime movie running a maximum of five thousand metres. But the director filmed eight thousand metres..."" Perhaps Wilder, with his clout, could have made a movie of the length Godard envisioned for this movie. (Or Melville, for that matter.) But Godard's 150-minute epic had to be cored, peeled, sliced, and stewed down to eighty-nine; as with the infamous screw-ups in Antonioni's Blow-Up that ended up being considered revolutionary, Godard stated that the jump-cuts now recognizable to any TV viewer (aside from being used in thousands of commercials, the jump-cut technique was a mainstay of Homicide: Life on the Street, one of the finest TV shows of the nineties) were the products of simple pragmatism: ""...when we came to [Belmondo and Seberg in the car], which had to be shortened like the others, instead of slightly shortening both, the editor and I flipped a coin...'we're going to cut out one or the other altogether, and then we will simply join the remaining shots'."" Pragmatism once again wins the day. (Modern viewers seeing the film for the first time are likely to see that scene and think about Homicide. I did, long before reading that piece.)

What remains, when you strip away the mystique and the seminality, however, doesn't necessarily have to be enjoyable. Thousands of fantasy novels read by millions of people are descended, directly or indirectly, from the Eddas. Have you ever read the Eddas? No, you probably haven't. Some find them enjoyable. I have my doubts that ninety or so percent of Lord of the Rings fans would agree with them. Why? Because Tolkien distilled what was there, embellished it, and then added his own artistic touches to make it his own epic, and he succeeded famously. Tens of thousands of copies of Lord of the Rings sell every year. Stack that up against maybe hundreds of copies of the Eddas. And so it is with Breathless; all those Pacino/Beatty/Nicholson/Penn characters (and the odd exclusion of DeNiro) quite simply did it better. Hell, look at John Cusack in The Grifters. (For some odd reason, that performance strikes me as the closest analogue. Don't ask me why, I've no idea.)

Yes, it's important, and it changed the face of filmmaking forever, but unlike a number of other films of that stripe, Breathless has not aged well in the least. To use one more quote, filmmaker and critic Tao Ruspoli says of Breathless that it ""...may be amusing to watch without attempting any sort of analysis, [but] its status as a masterpiece can only be understood through a careful analysis of its historical context."" I submit that a number of other, just as important, films don't require such context in order to be enjoyable (or, as ""enjoyable"" is not the precise word one would probably use for such movies as Birth of a Nation or Triumph of the Will, we'll substitute ""powerful"") to the modern viewer. Night of the Living Dead, just as important as Breathless, still holds up today not just because it changed the face of filmmaking, but because it's a cracking good piece of filmmaking. Similarly Murnau's Nosferatu or Welles' Citizen Kane. So why bother with it unless you're a film student who's been assigned it in class? Gets a single star for its historical importance, but certainly doesn't merit a recommendation unless you like gaping at Jean Seberg (which is, actually, quite a valid reason to watch it). *",1190332800,30,5053,4.8983644859813085

In a memorable, drawn out scene, the two lovers flirt and fight amongst the pillows, discussing the deeply philosophical and the trite and trivial. The dialogue sequence in this scene is a superb piece of cinematic realism. The detail of Breathless - Michel's white shirt and Bogart style cigarette and hat combo, Patricia's striped dresses, he city of Paris, a sharp jazz score, the doomed forebodings of noir - raise this film up to its position as Flicks magazine puts it: the yardstick of celluloid cool.",1180310400,,900,4.7025316455696204
684984,5,6303593135,"I finally did it. I finished watching "" bout de souffle"" aka ""Breathless"". I kept putting it off because I usually have problem when everybody tells me that such and such film is the epitome of its era or it breaks all the rules, starts the revolution, and reinvents the cinema. Well, "" bout de souffle"" does not put you under the pressure, it takes you for a ride, and you follow for 90 minutes its incredibly young characters, common crook (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his American free-spirited girlfriend (Jean Seberg) on their journey on the streets of 1960-th Paris along with Raoul Coutard's legendary camera. I am not going to tell here how great the camera work was, how fantastic the music score and the views of Paris were - the fans of the film know that already. They also know about the beginning of French New Wave, and how it influenced the future cinema. I just want to say that the movie was made over forty years ago - the smoking was cool back then, and Belmondo made smoking look very sexy. Belmondo fascinates me in this film. I've seen him in a lot of later movies - he's always been good (I recommend Le Magnifique, 1973 and Le Professionnel,1981 ) - but in  bout de souffle he is not just good - he is embodiment of cool, his face changes its expression every moment, you can not take your eyes off him. Is it me or he does remind the very young Mick Jagger - not commonly handsome but irresistible and sexy? He and young (she was 21 at the time) Jean Seaborg made one of the best screen couples ever. My favorite scenes:

Michel drives the stolen car in the beginning of the film, and he starts to talk to us, the audience. The day is nice, the sun is shining, and the life is beautiful...

Michel and Patricia drive in the convertible. The wind plays with her short hair. We only see the back of her head and her neck. Michel tells her that he loves the girl with a beautiful neck, wrists, knees, but she is a chicken...

Patricia comes to the hotel to find Michel in her bed. They start talking about nothing and about very serious things. They smoke, she tries to find a good place for her new poster, and he wants to sleep with her. In the end of the scene, his face, he looks at her - there is love in that look...

I've seen the Richard Gere version, and frankly, all I remember about it is the MTV music video for the theme song. The original gave me a completely different perception of the story, and the ending surprised me. I thought Jean-Paul Belmondo did a fantastic job with a complex character.

685018,4,6303593135,"What interests me is Truffaut's and Godard's very simple story is its ability to convey the nihilism of the main characters.  I believe it deserves at least as much attention as any of the evolutionary film making leaps that went into the film making.

The story is simple enough: Michel Poiccard (Jean Paul Belmondo) is a petty thief whom within the first five minutes of his appearance on screen has the cops on his tail because he has stolen a car.  Not being particularly bright, he shots the patrolman who pulls him over and leaves the scene of the crime rife with incriminating evidence.  The rest of the film, some eighty odd minutes consists of Michel chasing down money owed to him from earlier petty crimes; trying to keep one step ahead of the police and know what they know of his whereabouts; hanging out with and trying to sleep with Patricia Francini (Jean Seaberg), an American student at the Sorbonne and sometime writer for the Herald-Tribune--one gets the impression that the reason she is with him is that it is artistically inspired slumming for a novel she is working on.  It is Patricia who will ultimately betray Michel when her future in Paris is threatened by possibility of the loss of her visa and passport she willingly leads the police to him.  While they are still partners we are given an interesting look at the Paris underworld.

The world of petty thievery and the criminals on the margins of society who are the primary subject of Breathless were a group that Godard was in a good position to expostulate upon.  Having become totally obsessed with cinema while he was student at the Sorbonne, ostensibly studying ethnology, he was cut of from his families finances when they found out that ostensibly meant not at all and he had to subsist through petty theft.  The film--working often as a biography of Michel--shows a world of inactivity.  We see him sleeping, trying to put together the money that is owed him, comparing clothes with other petty thieves and trying keep Patricia amused and hopefully in bed.  He has absolutely no short term goals and his one ambition, going to Italy is little more than a pipe dream and is totally unrealistic.  Michel lives in a world that is totally sensory and sensual.  There is nothing about his character that suggests he could go beyond this, or that he wishes to.  Even worse than his sloth, is the fact that he is a total moral bankrupt: his code of conduct is so totally self-interested and egocentric as to be frightening.  In a word, it is degenerate.

Patricia is Michel's counterpoint in the film and though she comes from a different class background and has long term goals that presumably are not parasitic--being a journalist and novelist--she is just as morally repugnant as he is.  Although bright, intelligent and well educated she is totally self-absorbed.  As Dwight Macdonald  points out about the bedroom scene between Patricia and Michel ""...it becomes evident, through many small touches of dialogue and expression, that each lover is so bound by childish ego as to be unable to make contact with the other, that they are emotionally impotent.""  Patricia's self-centeredness can be seen in her reading of Faulkner to Michel and insisting on its beauty (he does not speak English) her constant changing of facial expressions in the mirror and her insistence that Michel acknowledge the beauty of a Renoir reproduction that hangs on her wall.  Neither are trying to connect with the other on any but the most superficial level.  They are simply using each other.  It may not be evil, but it certainly is amoral.

Two amoral characters would not be all that threatening, but as Pauline Kael points out, what makes the film so disturbing is just how little the characters give a damn about anything.  ""This new race lives for the moment because that is all that they care about.""  The group of people Michel is representative of are marginal and have no stake in society, do not accept the tenets of loyalty or even a code of conduct going beyond meeting and satiating immediate wants.  Patricia is just as dangerous for different reasons though.  Although she has of vision of the future for herself ""she is so free that she has no sense of responsibility of guilt....  The codes of love and loyalty...depend on stronger emotions than her idle attachment to this lover....""  People like this represent a danger to society that goes beyond their numbers because the damage they can do is totally out of proportion with their numbers.

What finally makes Breathless so unique amongst underworld films is its differences from the gangster films that preceded it.  Michel is almost a polar opposite Rico Bandello.  Where Rico is chaste, Michel is a fornicator.  Where Rico is obsessed with power and making it, Michel could care less as long as there are cars to steal and fun to be had.  They both ultimately are brought down by their big egos and stupidity though.",1156204800,2,4959,4.794117647058823
685019,5,6303593135,"Why is the first movie by Godard different from so much independent cinema nowadays?  After all, Godard always is trying to impress us with cinematic tricks and arbitrary changes of mood and pace.  But there is an important difference.  When you listen to his characters talk, they are speaking reality.  When he films Paris even before the fifties were over, you get the exact feeling of the town without sweeping shots of the skyline.  And when he does some expected thing, he does tongue-in-cheek, playing with the conventions, subverting them and making you laugh about them.  So you have innovative cinema, instant icons, cult scenes, and a lot of talk about love, sex, high-culture, jazz music, post-modernism before it was even imagined, and one of the more beautiful imagined cities in the world.  And after this Godard would become even more radical, changing the way we can understand cinema, challenging the status of the art that he wants to elevate (but he knows how?).  I cannot emphasize how revolutionary all the thing feels.  And it is forty-seven years old?!  Like other Godards, it makes you think that we, as Westerners, haven't got too far from what he saw so many years ago.",1148860800,3,1196,4.876237623762377

I understand that it was an important movie that deviated from the conventional style back then and and it was an early new-wave movie after the 400 blows. I get all the points godard tries to make in this movie. Like emphasizing on unnecessary details(the chat on the street, in the bedroom) and cutting short major events(killing the cop). But at the end of the day I was not very impressed, the movie didn't catch my attention. On the other hand the 30 minute sequence in the apartment between bridget bardot and ger husband in Contempt was intruging, complex and masterful.",1139097600,5,689,4.702479338842975
685021,5,6303593135,"A movie more famous for style than substance, though it set the movie world on its head. A third-rate hood in Paris (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who thinks he's Bogart, steals a car, then kills the policeman who pulls him over. Now on the lam he goes to his girlfriend (Jean Seberg) and asks her to hide him until he can collect some money owed him from a previous job; after that he tells her they will go to Rome. But Seberg is as empty, soul-less, and finally ruthless as he is, and at the end she turns him in to the police.

But it's the way Goddard relates the story that had everyone ga-ga over this movie masterpiece: he presented new ways of viewing his material - fast-cutting, imaginative camera angles, a total breakdown of time and space, no transitions. His idea was to give the impression of ""living in the moment."" There are some memorable scenes, especially the bedroom scene with Belmondo and Seberg discussing art and philosophy and the final shot of Seberg, but at times it's very hard to relate to these two conscienceless, amoral characters; I know it's all about alienation and impetuosity, but whew!

The location photography on the streets of Paris is superb and set another precedent for New Wave filmmaking. Excellent too is the musical score (part jazz, part classical). It's an extremely influential movie, groundbreaking and revolutionary, though some of it's most creative techniques (jump-cutting, for example) have become second nature today.",1138060800,7,1468,4.891566265060241
685022,5,6303593135,"First, I must say I enjoy these types of movies.  Characters who are living on the edge of society, almost oblivious to it.  That obviously says something about me, the viewer, the interpreter.  It also says something about how I view reality.  As Marx noted, humans are self-interested creatures at the core.  The rest is constructed fluff.  This movie, for me, flows along that premise.
Second, I had read nothing on this film until after I saw it a couple days ago.  I knew Jean-Luc Godard was a very influential filmmaker, but little about this film itself.  When I first saw the jump cuts I thought, ""what the h&*@?""  Others say those were political comments, revolutionary, forced, or just plain amateurish.  What Roger Ebert conveys is Godard had to cut 30 minutes of film, so he went through and cut out anything he found boring.  Sounds logical.  This led to the final product, which includes the jump cuts.  Well, I think as a style it ends up working.  This is a ""rough"" film about an ""amateur"" criminal.  Perhaps along its core is a universal political statement about social authority and the individual reactions to it.  In the movie people die, and they die through the unpolished style of the main character, who simply lives how he chooses.
Third, to me, the camera work, the acting, the script, all flow seemingly into a very stylized film that pays homage to the petty crime drama genre.  In a way it is Reservoir Dogs before Reservoir Dogs.  But it is also more.  It tells the truth about love.  Love isn't as simple as meeting somebody, sleeping with them, marrying them, having children, aging, and dying.  Love, like life, is beautiful but messy.  This film matches love and life perfectly.  Just as amazingly, like the other film I mentioned, it manages to remain ""on the fringe"" of cinema while reinventing the industry in an important way and becoming a topic in mainstream discussions about film making.  Certainly we have moved on.  Breathless is not the only great movie ever made.  There are movies made today that may even be its equal.  Breathless becomes immortal, then dies.",1133481600,3,2108,4.751381215469613
685023,4,6303593135,"What can one say about BREATHLESS that hasn't already been said?  From the opening moments of the film, I was shocked by the camera work.  It was not until after I had seen the film that I learned about its ""groundbreaking techniques"" and the fact that many people consider it the beginning of modern cinema.  So I can only tell you my initial impression of the film: this does not feel like 1959.  The close-ups in the opening sequences, the playfulness of Jean-Paul Belmondo's acting style, the spontaneous dialogue and feeling of improvisation-all of these aspects led me to believe that the film was quite modern.  Like a good piece of jazz music from the 1950s which can still shock & awe today, BREATHLESS won me over in its opening sequences.  It is definitely ""in your face"" filmmaking at its best.

One thing that BREATHLESS certainly nails is the relationship between our ""Bonny & Clyde"" characters.  Many people have complained about the ""bedroom"" sequence, citing its length, lack of scripted dialogue, and the like.  It would never have survived in modern cinema.  However, Godard manages to capture something in these ""spontaneous"" sequences.  I really felt like they were a casual couple.  Their lines are not perfect.  They are reacting to one another.  It's like we've been placed in their bedroom and we feel as if we are a hundred miles from any theater.  This is life.  Is it true that life is a bit boring at times and lacks a script?  Yeah.  But perhaps that is his point.  BREATHLESS, despite its titles, ""breathes"" life into its script and characters by allowing them to improvise their way through the film.

That being said, I think that all ""groundbreaking"" films are destined to get certain things wrong.  In particular, BREATHLESS ""feels"" a bit too experimental.  That is to say, it is an experiment in going against the grain and it is (sometimes) painfully aware of that fact.  Let's take the ""jump cuts,"" for instance.  While Godard may have paved the way for modern ""quick cuts,"" his jump cuts often occur within a scene and give the film an ""amateur"" feel at times.  Remember when you made the videos for Spanish class and had to go back and ""fix"" a line error?  Do you remember the awkward cuts and how that would effect both the visual and auditory aspects of your movie?  Well, that's kind of what happens in BREATHLESS.  In fact, it happens so often that one wonders if he wasn't trying to go for that effect. It is distracting at several points in the film and I am one who would've recommended a bit more polish in places.

Overall, I would recommend you see this film if you are interested in film history and seeing the so-called ""great films.""  BREATHLESS is the start of something huge and is often regarded as a pinnacle work of one of the world's greatest directors of all time.  But if you're looking for a date movie or something for the whole family, I'd probably choose something else.  There's a bit too much of ""life"" in this movie to make it suitable for mindless popcorn munching.",1131494400,3,3034,4.666037735849057
685024,5,6303593135,"Godard saw that amateur films of family and friends had a poignant nostalgia and an immediacy that was lacking in American films.  Even the great Hitchcock working in America at well-financed studios produces his masterpieces with great deliberation and finesse creating a plastic art.  So Godard mixes improvisation, street scenes shot from within a box on a wheelchair and captures Parisians as they really are in their banality, in their recognizable humanity, and therefore, the thrill of humankind in recognition.

The Belmondo character smokes his fat Chesterfields exactly like Bogart, his gangster screen mentor.  So the director interjects his admiring eye on American film actors within the storyline.  Belmondo impersonates Bogart, his many personal screen quirks, but then the stoic Bogey is exaggerated, a modern stalking horse for future punkdom.  You could almost see the swinging 60's five years in advance as Belmondo and doll-like Jean Seberg prance about Paris, breaking the stodgy rules of their 1940's,1950's parents, making love on a whim, making banal, pseudo-intellectual references, outlandish statements - I've had lovers, many, anyone I see, blahhh blah, I'm pregnant - so what - let's get under the sheets, banality under amazing visual setups in a plain room for thirty minutes. Then there's the cuts from moment to moment, a two or three minute cut to the same shot with the car driving through Paris - a parade of diplomats - a policeman on the trail of Belmondo interwoven, so we have the effect, especially in black and white, of a documentary spliced together by an amateur.

These are all very original ideas, which I think along with One Life to Live make Godard a heavy weight in the pentathlon of great directors.",1130803200,2,1751,5.144366197183099

This is one of the great masterpieces of both the French New Wave (nouvelle vague) and Godard (as well as Truffaut, who shares a writing credit). Both Belmondo and Seberg are well-cast and exciting to watch. Between Jean Seberg and Anna Karina, Godard had the good-sense/luck to work with two of the most beautiful and interesting women I've ever had the pleasure to watch.

685026,5,6303593135,"Franois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette and Eric Rohmer were film connoisseurs, who all worked as movie critics for the same magazine. Between the years 1958 to 1964, this group transitioned into filmmaking, and, along with other directors, such as Agns Varda, Jean-Pierre Melville and Louis Malle, ushered in the French New Wave Movement, (Nouvelle Vague). Their background in film theory and criticism was a major factor in motivating these artists to create a bold new cinema.

Jean-Luc Godard's first feature, ""Breathless,"" was released in 1960, introducing the New Wave and changing cinema forever. Godard used jump cuts, handheld cameras, zoom lenses and a new editing style to take the viewer places never ventured before. No artificial, glossy stage sets in this movie. Along with the protagonists, we travel up and down small side streets, into local bars and sidewalk cafes, across boulevards and, for inconsequential moments, brush the lives of passers-by, who have nothing to do with the screenplay, but always play a role in our daily comings and goings. The fragmented rhythm of modern life is translated here. Godard used sound in the same way, adding street noises, bits of conversations and music to add to the movie's authenticity and pace. This was indeed innovative at the time. And it still holds up. Watching ""Breathless"" forty-five years after its debut, 21st century technology does not detract from its dynamism or relevance in the slightest. In fact, with each viewing, I find the film every bit as exciting and poignant as I did the first time.

Jean-Paul Belmondo plays the feckless, foul-mouthed car thief, anti-hero and Humphrey Bogart fan, Michel Poiccard. Just a few minutes after the opening credits conclude, Michel's status changes from small-time hood to cop killer. His life's plans alter drastically as he becomes a hunted fugitive. Michel remains cool enough, however, to visit an old girlfriend and steal some money. Bogart would have been proud - not of the theft, but of the style. Michel spots gamine-like American, Patricia Franchini, (the lovely Jean Seberg), selling copies of the Herald Tribune on the Champs-Elysees, and pursues her, with roguish smiles and moody pouts. He curses her and moves off fast, though, when she gives him a hard time. He likes his women more enthusiastic. Instead of getting out of town fast, Michel hangs with fellow thugs and steals more cars.

Patricia is an enigmatic character, who occasionally startles with her observations and revelations. Twenty years-old, with the naive face of an angel, she seems to have no direction or goals in life. She studies at the Sorbonne and says she wants to write, but is oddly detached. She shuns commitment. She does occasional odd jobs for the newspaper, but appears to live in a dream world. Of course Patricia winds up with Michel and together they gallivant around the gorgeous streets of Paris, as if they haven't a care in the world. Patricia does have at least one problem, however - she might be pregnant. Together the couple attempts to collect on a debt to raise enough cash to escape to Italy.

Godard captures incredibly intimate moments between the two lovers, particularly in one lengthy, extremely realistic bedroom episode, filled with small talk, tenderness, petty cruelties, eroticism, mind games, childhood memories shared and loneliness. At the scene's end we have a better understanding of the self destructive individuals who make-up this twosome. A sense of burgeoning doom, which has hovered in the background all along, begins to increase here. Michel's bravado also escalates with the level of danger and, to his credit, he remains true to his idol, Bogart, to the end. The conclusion boggles the mind, at least it has always impacted me emotionally in a major way.

Belmondo is brilliant as the restless thief, in this, his first film role. He reminds me of a French James Dean. Seberg is convincing and fresh. This is a dynamic film, witty, fast-paced, romantic and disturbing. It has long been a favorite of mine.

I was put off when half-way through, my wife started snoring and my 15-year-old movie buff daughter picked up a maths book to study in preference to watching more of it.

The most irritating scene is where Michel sits around in his undies playing the tough wiseass beseeching his 'girlfriend' to sleep with him. I doubt there was a tight script for this part of the movie. In an attempt to be hyper-realistic this scene sadly comes across as totally feigned - it's embarrasing watching the actors ad-libbing to fill-out their roles - and from this point the immersion in the reality of the movie is completely destroyed.

It reminded me of a John Waters movie with a girl is sitting on a train, eating lunch, farting, scratching her nose and staring out the window... for two hours. Performance art? Maybe.",1112745600,5,972,4.645348837209302
685061,5,6303593135,"Numerous reviews, essays, and books have dedicated much thought and contemplative work on Jean-Luc Godard's film Breathless.  So where does one begin this review knowing that many have already dissected his film?  Perhaps, we should try to understand why this film has received so much commotion.

Contemplating the society when Breathless was shot and comparing it with our current society might not be the best approach.  It is also silly to think that a young audience will get all the references to older films, which Breathless intends to shove aside with a refreshing style.  For example, jump cuts are something that today's youth have seen millions of times.  If people watch MTV or any other television channel they will see the infamous jump cut in action in both recorded and live format.  So why bother watching Breathless?  Well, to fully appreciate Breathless the audience should watch films from France and the rest of the world that were made before, let's say in 1955.  In this way the audience will build an idea of how stiff and structured films were without much visual surprise, which big production companies still depend on occasionally as they use them as a safety net in fear of having a bomb at the box office.

Breathless is actually a refreshing breath of a new wave that hit the world of the cinema in the 1960s.  This fresh idea helped develop film and cinema into what it is today, and this is why Breathless is such an important film.  The film broke the cinematic rules that were in use by the production companies.  For example, Godard wrote his shooting script during his morning coffee while probably inhaling his nicotine fumes, scenes where not rehearsed and the idea of how to frame a shot came though the motion and the making of the film.  Cinematography used handheld cameras a long time before it became common through lightweight cameras.  Contempt was expressed in regards to meticulous lighting.  The filmmakers tossed the old ways out through the window and began to create a new form of visual expression, which was only a natural progress for cinema just as art has advanced through history.

Breathless takes place in Paris where Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) seeks refuge in the masses after having killed a traffic policeman in a moment of fear.  Wanted and hunted Michel takes short cuts to find money by stealing money from old girlfriends and trying to get back old debts, money Michel needs in order to leave the country.  However, he has also made new acquaintance in Paris that infatuate him, the beautiful American Patricia Franchini, a Iowan girl by the name of Jean Seberg who sought refuge in France after a couple of box office bombs in United States.  Michel seeks Patricia as a means to find shelter and possibly affection.

The chemistry between the Michel and Patricia generates a certain mystique, as Patricia always seems to be full of astonishing revelations.  For example, she tells out of the blue that she is pregnant and that she requires her freedom.  Michel on the other hand is an uncomplicated guy with a tough faade that he seems to borrow through his hero Humphrey Bogart--style he mimics by having a constant cigarette that is hanging of either one lip or squeezed in between.  The character's differences could maybe be a result of the individual styles of acting, but also on Godard's rejuvenating style of directing.  This mystique keeps lingering in the air through the cinematography and the performances of the actors.

Regardless of how the mystique is generated, the film provides a wonderful cinematic experience, as it is full of surprises and leaves the audience in a breathtaking, yet quirky visual journey.  This further evolves on how Godard makes the film a little more interesting in a cerebral way in regards to cinema.  For example, Godard efficiently uses the director Jean-Pierre Melville, to perform as a famous writer that Patricia interviews while Michel uses one of Melville's films, Bob le Flambeur (1955), as a reference of who would pay a debt.  Ultimately, the audience has experienced an interesting cinematic expedition through Breathless, especially in a historical perspective.  The story is not intricate, yet it is the simplicity that Godard employs that makes this film so wonderful.",1111881600,27,4306,4.96513249651325
685062,5,6303593135,"Perhaps I will be the first to admit something no self-respecting film critic would say about such a brilliant period of filmmaking, The French New Wave (a movement that was solidified between the late 1950s and 1960s).  I didn't like BREATHLESS the first time I saw it.  In fact, I even had the audacity to publish a review here, that first time, stating that I didn't like it because of its style, as well as the overall way it left me feeling (completely unresolved).  Of course, no one found my review helpful.  I had a lot of nerve, taking on one of the most definitive films of that era and boldly putting it down!  Upon second reflection, I realize that the feeling it left me with was intended, and also why it was hailed as one of the greatest films from the time period.  Therefore, I felt compelled (since I deleted that old review) to properly acknowledge BREATHLESS, directed by Jean Paul Belmondo, as the masterpiece that it is.

As far as the story goes, I don't want to waste too much space, here, re-telling it.  I will say that Jean-Paul Belmondo, as Michel, our ""anti-hero"" is deliciously unsavory and the ultimate wise guy.  This thug idolizes Humphrey Bogart and feels very comfortable to make the stand as an anarchist in the face of the law, society and his girlfriend, Patricia (Jean Seberg).  BREATHLESS follows these two and their exploits, through jagged camera angles and really thrives on a ""less is more"" approach.  There is a great deal of subtlety here.  That includes numerous, off the cuff references to cinema, the director and his work as a critic, and plenty of double entendre.  I really reccomend this, because if a film has the capacity to drive someone to such frustration and irritation and then bring about a total 180 degree change of heart so many years later, that is certainly an example of compelling cinema.",1102118400,2,1856,4.673846153846154

685066,5,6303593135,"I've been meaning to catch up with Jean-Luc Godard's French New Wave classic BREATHLESS for a while now, ever since I became a big cinema enthusiast. Godard is said to have been one of the great film innovators of the 1960s, and this was the film that announced his arrival to the film world as a major new talent. I was able to catch up with this DVD recently, and I was not disappointed by the movie at all. In fact, I was intrigued and often startled by its sheer freshness and stylistic innovation. I was also intrigued by its characters: Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), a criminal trying to elude capture by the authorities throughout the picture; and his American girlfriend Patricia (Jean Seberg), a wannabe-journalist who is strangely drawn to the lowlife Michel. This is perhaps youth as Godard saw it: disaffected, indifferent to anything but themselves and their own lives...maybe even existentialist. Michel himself towards the ends doesn't even seem to really care that the police are closing in on him; and by the end, Patricia doesn't either. These two young people are basically self-absorbed narcissists, and Godard similarly doesn't try to connect the audience to these hardly-sympathetic characters. We are often kept at an emotional reserve from these two people, just as they keep their distance from the real world circumstances around them. (Michel makes a fitting statement towards the end when he says to Patricia, ""When we talked, I talked about me, you talked about you, when we should have talked about each other."") In short, the characters themselves may not be the most memorable in movie history, but their cold, detached worldview most certainly is.

If the characters are interesting to simply observe, the technique is also equally fascinating to watch. BREATHLESS has a small reputation of being the first film to extensively use the ""jump cut,"" sudden cuts in the middle of scenes. Personally, I wasn't always sold on Godard's frequent use of it in this film, but when it works---as in one short sequence in which Michel tries to describe Patricia in various ways---it works very well, somehow making the film more realistic-feeling as a result. The cinematographer of BREATHLESS, Raoul Coutard, also uses a lot of handheld camera work---supposedly one of the first films to do so---to impart a documentary feel to the movie. In short, all throughout the movie you see glimmers of this film's incalculable influence on later filmmakers (Martin Scorsese immediately comes to my mind; BREATHLESS' realism and style reminds me of his early film MEAN STREETS).

To sump up: BREATHLESS is a seminal work of the cinema that has still managed to remain fresh and startling over the years. Its main characters and filmmaking style still manage to fascinate, and I don't feel that it has dated a whole lot since its landmark release in 1961. It still remains as potent as ever...just as any ""classic"" film should. Highly recommended.",1093305600,4,2958,5.022403258655804
685067,5,6303593135,"On this wonderful DVD of ""Breathless"" the commentary by film critic David Sterritt on Jean-Luc Godard's new wave masterpiece is so insightful that it makes this DVD even more of a must have for any lover of international cinema. It is a delight to hear his enthusiasm for the film, the director and the stars. Beyond that, there is this landmark film that in its new pristine restoration is so fresh and vibrant that it leaps from the screen. It is packed with incredible images of the three major characters of the story, Belmondo, Seberg, and Paris. It all seems to have been shot only yesterday. Jagged and edgy in its famous jump cut editing and with fluid cinematography by the famous Raoul Coutard it is as fresh and exciting as it was forty-four years ago.

  The film is full of homage after homage to movies and pop culture of the day that so inspired Godard and many of his contemporaries. All of this is interlaced with a story of two characters so convinced of their independence from society that they cannot see how trapped they are within their self-created images gleaned from the icons of that time and place. All of this is presented with a wonderful mix of humor and suspense that propels the story forward in jerks and leaps through the city. Only when we are in Patricia's apartment does the film switch to long lingering shots of the everyday life of these two people. Then back out on the streets and the frantic chase with the cops and the search for an escape.

  Jean Paul Belmondo is simply incredible to watch in this the film that made him and his tough sexy image famous throughout the world. He is so natural, and human as to seem to be caught by the eye of the camera completely unaware in his life as Michel Poiccard. Jean Seberg broke out of her limited Hollywood shell and embarked on her European career with her role as Patricia the American girlfriend of Michel who ultimately and inexplicably does what she must do. It is obvious that Godard and his cameraman adore her and the wide-open eye of the lens lingers on her with the same enamored devotion that Michel reluctantly shows her. With this film she really shows the range of her talent and how good she really was in the medium of film acting.

Here are two of the most photogenic faces of the early sixties shot without Hollywood lighting setups. Yet some of the shots have a glamour that Hollywood could not equal in all its artifice. Yet all the time this groundbreaking film never for a moment lets you forget you are watching a movie-movie. Both real and fake it achieves a fantastic reality all its own that changed cinema in profound ways and is still affecting the way we look at and make movies today.",1090886400,4,2705,4.530737704918033

685069,4,6303593135,"All right - Breathless is an important film and I can see why.  This is the film that gave birth to the French New Wave.  Before this, films look like they were shot in a studio.  This film made the gritty look of seventies filmmaking - and indeed, today's independent filmmaking - possible.  This film has a guerrilla feel to it, which makes it seem very modern.  Goddard films on actual locations with handheld cameras.  The most obvious innovation is the deliberate use of ""jump cuts"", which goes against the traditional theory of ""invisible edits.""  The story itself (by Francois Truffaut) is innovative - it foreshadows Quentin Tarantino with its non-moralistic account of a cold-blooded, Bogart-worshipping killer (wonderfully played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his crazy/beautiful American girlfriend.
That having been said, the style of this film is really what is important.  Looked at today, when its innovations have been absorbed into mainstream film, TV, and commercials, some of the flaws are more apparent.  Especially towards the end of the film, when the story gets wackier and the style gets over-the-top, it became hard to restrain my Mystery Science Theater comments.  That is the problem with being the first in anything - you go too far and you date yourself.  Although Goddard started the Nouvelle Vague, I think that Truffaut - as evidenced by his script here - is the more important artist.  This is the film that paves the way for better films like The 400 Blows.  However, Breathless is still a good film and a must for any serious student of cinema.  Although there are few extras on this DVD, the film looks great.  For all its flaws, Breathless still has an air of authenticity that few films today can dream of.",1080604800,29,1741,4.8941979522184305

685091,2,6303593135,"The reaction of someone who is not a film historian:
This is obviously not intended as a work of surrealism or Dada. Godard has a story to tell, and two characters to introduce to us.  I suggest that the film techniques be measured by whether they contribute to these goals.  The use of handheld camera, long shots, candid shots of Paris do.  They give the film a sense of energy and reality, and have perhaps been adopted by others because of this.  The ""jump cuts"" (which I take to mean the abrupt cuts in the middle of scenes, with no attempt to maintain continuity) do not.  They are distracting and remind you, with a jolt, and indeed never permit you to forget, that you are watching a film.  This is not like noticing that a great painting is made up of the artist's individual brushstrokes; more like brushstrokes that keep you from seeing the overall picture.  It just comes off as amateurish, and interfers with plot and character development.
Seborg didn't seem to me to work in this role.  I think Godard means to tell us that she is not vulnerable but in fact the same sort of animal as Belmondo, but the toughness was not persuasive (esp. the obvious self consciousness of the closing shot).  If this is not what was meant, then she failed to communicate to this viewer what exactly it was that motivated her character.  Does that mean she is ""deep""?",1074988800,6,1364,4.530612244897959
685092,4,6303593135,"When I first saw Godard's Breathless, perhaps I had my expectactions high, or rather manipulated to be as such from reading other reviews, and I ended up thinking that while there was a flair for style and a rhythm that was a reminder of the jazzy feel in Cassavettes' Shadows, the characters, inparticular the lead, were too shallow, self-righteous, and all-too-vain for comfort - or perhaps too, well, French.
On a few more tries of the ""groundbreaker of the French new-wave"" (which I believe was at it's absolute best in Truffaut's 400 Blows, accessible to a wider audience), I see that Godard, as much as he probably loves his characters, he despises them as well, in a sense.  It could even be suggested that Godard sees himself in the lead Belmondo's role, and if that's the case then Godard is practicing the old self-reflection trick (though the story is loosely based on a newspaper article, scripted by Truffaut himself).  For those that can take such filmmaking, this is the treat of the week.  And for film buffs it should be seen at least once to get an idea where most ""affluent"" independent filmmakers get their edge, and indeed its rhythm will give inspiration to struggling filmmakers.  I might even see it again in several months to remind myself how inspired the jump cuts were that Godard used.  But, I certainly don't think that it's among the greatest films ever.",1054771200,8,1385,4.7782426778242675
685093,5,6303593135,"I first watched ""Breathless"" in a film class my Senior year in college and I was amazed by it. Although this film was made many years ago, I was blown away by the production techniques used. Some people in my film class thought the movie was stupid and made no sense, while others (including myself) found the beauty in it's ability not to stick to the norm and be compelling in a subtle way. In a time when continuity is extremely important in film, it was refreshing to see jump cuts that were made on purpose (or rather necessity since Godard had to cut the film down considerably from his original cut). Jean-Luc Godard is a true genius!
This film revolves around the character of Michel, a common hood, who gets mixed up in the murder of a police officer while trying to win over the heart of the woman he loves. The plot to the story is simple, but the outcome is exciting.
""Breathless"" is definitely not for everyone. It makes you think about hidden messages, symbolism, etc. However, it is very enjoyable and entertaining. I would highly suggest this film.

Truffaut's script is excellent, nearly every shot is original and revelatory, but what I loved most about the movie was the apparently random, documentary feel Godard gave to so many of the scenes:  Belmondo with one lens missing from his glasses, the faces he and Jean Seberg make in the mirror, the Air France clerk sticking her tongue out at her boss, etc.  How did Godard manage to be so stylish and truthful at the same time?

685095,5,6303593135,"""Breathless,"" Jean-Luc Godard's tribute to moviemaking itself and one of the seminal titles of the French New Wave, is, jump-cuts and all, a film that changed the way movies were made. It introduced audiences and critics alike to new voices in the cinema, to a newer and cheaper guerrilla-style film made on location and to the sort of movie aware of the fact that it was just a movie.
That said, though, this movie is a lot of just pure fun. In the leads, Jean-Paul Belmondo and the absolutely gorgeous Jean Seberg seem to inject their portrayals of young thief-and-killer Michel Poiccard and his indecisive American girlfriend Patricia with a sense of humor and joy. The couple they portray are given moments where they're not really pushing the action forward, where they're reveling in what it feels like to be young and in lust, if not love. The scenes where they're lying in bed just talking or riding together in a car and talking about Paris are perhaps the most delightful aspect of the film.
Even though the character of Michel is almost certainly doomed from the moment he steals a car and guns down a police officer, he has a lot of fun with his last days, wandering the streets, stealing from friends and trying to get Patricia to sleep with him. Patricia, likewise, is given moments of joy, despite worrying about her pregnancy and job, wondering if she should betray the man she loves to the police or run away with him to Rome.
That spirit, in addition to its technical wizardry and the passion of its makers, is what made the film different in 1960, and it's the spirit behind it that just makes ""Breathless"" fun Sunday-afternoon viewing now.",1043107200,,1659,4.684931506849315
685096,5,6303593135,"More than forty years later, it may be hard for modern audiences to understand how revolutionary Jean-Luc Godard and his Nouvelle Vague (French New Wave) contemporaries really were.  So many aspects of Godard's stylistic achievements, such as the unabashedly hand-held camera, have become so popular in music videos, TV, and the movies, that its use here may not seem notable.  Film critic David Sterritt's commentary track does an excellent job of conveying the importance of this first feature-length Godard opus, and also emphasizes the many ways in which the director is having fun with his audience.  As Sterritt demonstrates, Godard uses what he has enjoyed from his life as a lover of movies to deliver a filmgoing experience that contains the humor and action that he enjoys.  Godard lingers on the lengthy interactions between Breathless' two young actors, allowing us all to savor their intimacy, and also uses Brechtian self-conscious techniques to encourage the viewer to stop and consider his filmic experience.  Breathless is a great introduction to Godard, much more accessible to current American audiences than his later work.  Watch the movie first, then watch it again with the excellent commentary track.",1042588800,8,1224,5.316062176165803

True, there are attractive moments in Godard's cinema verite style. But the situations are so boring and the lead male character so vacuous that it is hard not to get irritated. One reviewer praised Godard for spending a half hour with the couple lounging around in her bed. Boring, boring, and finally, irritating. Try the 400 Blows -- similar style but a really interesting, even gripping, story.",1042329600,5,565,4.957894736842105
685099,5,6303593135,"The film that validated the French New Wave and consummated the now-ubiquitous cinma vrit, ""fly-on-the-wall"" cinematography of modern independent film, Jean-Luc Godard's debut feature Breathless, as influential as it's obviously been (one need only gaze as far back as the extended bedroom scene of 2002's ""Late Marriage"" to catch a recognizable echo of its ingenuity), still remains as challenging today as it must have been in 1959. Stylistically, the jagged editing technique is what will always call the most attention to itself: Godard chose to snip out small pockets of celluloid almost arbitrarily between most of the action and dialogue, ostensibly to cut down the running time, but effectively to mimic the erratic, shallow attention span of his characters. In turn, the deliberateness of this device tends to distract from the essential simplicity of Godard's narrative, about a killer on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who plots to flee the country with his Parisian lover (Jean Seberg). Revisiting this quaint work of artistry today reveals that Godard, in his vision of existentialist ennui and contemporary youth, has never really been intellectually surpassed in this subject matter by any subsequent film directors. For one matter, his picture's visual impudence alone renders most other cinma vrit timid in comparison. It's one of the few films of its kind that actually dares to appear as clumsy as possible.",1027900800,3,1424,5.361607142857143

My only complaint with the DVD is the narrow-screen ""pan and scan"" format, and the sound quality.

685132,4,6303593135,"If you don't see this with the proper context, it can be a bit of a headscratcher as to why this movie is important.  It's a bit like watching ""Birth of a Nation""; it's hard to get that sense of ""D.W. Griffith was there FIRST"", especially since the film's content is, to say the least, appalling.
So, in a nutshell: French film between the 40s and the 60s was largely focused on big, lavish literary adaptations.  It was staid, it was pretty vapid in some respects artistically (although there are some very beautiful films from that time such as ""Children of Paradise"", available from the Criterion Collection), and it was safe for the unwashed masses, despite the artistic world surrounding it.  You also have to remember that at the time, films weren't considered art by the academics of the day, they were ""mere"" entertainment.
A group of filmmakers decided to try and change this, and the country got swept up.  ""Breathless"" was something totally new and different and furthermore, it made a mint at the box office (not a commonly mentioned fact, but part of the reason the New Wave took off was that the early films made money)  If you followed the American indie scene in the mid-90s, it was much the same way; ANYBODY could get a movie made, and there were stunning surprise hits.
So that's why ""Breathless"" is so important and why so many people love it.
That said, as an actual movie, it's dated, both from the fact that its techniques have been ripped off so many times and the fact that in a simple technical straightforward sense, it wasn't that good a movie in the first place.
Visually, it is excellent.  All those using DV camcorders now would do well to imitate Godard's use of handheld camerawork; it's obvious he meticulously planned every shot and didn't just improvise like a lot of them.  He knows how to frame his shots and how to use camera motion.  Actingwise, especially considering the script, it's also quite enjoyable.
If you don't want to read criticism of this film, stop reading; I give this three stars on the above merits plus one star for historical value.
In other respects, it's horrendous.  ""Breathless"" never develops a point; the plot is ill considered and more often than not feels like an inept parody of American B-movies, not a tribute.  Unlike the movies he's imitating, ""Breathless"" has no sense of urgency and offers us no reason to care about the characters, especially the lead, who's basically just another jerk.  I'm unimpressed by Godard's constant film referencing or the placement of some of his jump cuts; they add nothing.
Part of this is, as I said, the fact that the film has been ripped off so many times that its techniques are no longer new.  But just sit down with some work from Welles, Powell and Pressburger, Yasujiro Ozu, Bunuel, or Alfred Hitchock, watch that and then ""Breathless"", and you realize that they have something Godard doesn't; a care for the story in addition to the care for the images.",1014249600,9,2967,4.706563706563706
685133,4,6303593135,"Not exactly a thriller in the purest sense, film critic Jean-Luc Godard's first film ""A Bout de Souffle"" or ""BREATHLESS"" [...], originally released in 1961, not only ushered in the French New Wave (Nouvelle Vague) movement, but assured the director of a career and made an international star of Jean Paul Belmondo.
Seeing this clean, full-frame digital transfer today, one is jolted with the timeless quality of this assured filmed experiment that daringly broke the rules and locked in a new cinematic language, or at least a new dialect.  A hand-held camera more often than not on the move, a black and white documentary feel of realism and natural lighting and locations (not sets), jump cuts, improvisational shots and long, loose, naturalistic conversations (about things other than the so-called plot) between Belmondo and co-star Jean Seberg as amoral lovers on the run.""Breathless"" suffered an anemic remake in 1983 with Richard Gere as a kind of amphetamine-crazed nut case in the Belmondo role.
The original title more accurately translates as ""Out of Breath.""  And it is an exhilarating film to re-experience,  In form and theme, this is an existential, anti-film film with numerous, sly film references within the movie frame, in images, props and in the sometimes intentionally ""big movie music"" moments to punch up the irony of a scene.  This is a great film.",1006128000,4,1373,5.116071428571429
685134,5,6303593135,"Godard's ""Breathless"" (or ""Out of Breath,"" the correct translation fo the title) still feels fresh and alive, especially when viewed in the dreary context of contemporary Hollywood cinema.  It offers a sparklingly original alternative at every turn, from the pacing of its story to the engine that drives its loopy, intentionally sloppy plot.  This is a picture that is alive on screen as you watch it, forcing you to draw yourself into the action rather than lay back and passively absorb it.
The film is one of the finest examples of New Wave cinema, from its jump cuts, its depiction of Parisian life, its incredibly sustained sequences of pure converstaion and dialogue, all of which dominate what is essentially a simple chase picture.
Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg are a perfect mix of classic and contemporary, both remaining timeless.  Their relationship really unfolds in the film's central sequence, a near 25-minute conversation in Seberg's bedroom, in which such subjects as Faulkner and fornication are explored aptly.  And that is what the film is known for----when was the last time a thriller contained the audacity to feel free to explore areas residing outside the genre?
Like ""Pulp Fiction,"" one of its distant relatives, this is a film where plot and story are present but removed far into the background, while character, dialogue and visual texture are placed in the foreground.  In its pristine black-and-white cinematography, its innovative use of camera movement and position, its raw, defined performances, and its tireless style and visual invention, ""Breathless"" is a great film and belongs in any serious film lover's video library.",1002240000,27,1666,5.224719101123595
