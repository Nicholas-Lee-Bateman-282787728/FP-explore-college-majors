3518296,3,B001CTDH76,"this is a great tv show don't get me wrong...but compared to psych it's just DUMB,",1243468800,4,82,4.1875
3518297,5,B001CTDH76,"I've come into the crime drama genre recently, having fallen in with roommates who watch NCIS, CSI, Criminal Minds, the Medium, etc. on a regular basis. Out of all the crime shows I've seen - and even most other prime time TV - the Mentalist is one of the very few with which I actively try to stay current.

Admittedly, the premise is similar to Psych, but while I find Psych's Shawn annoying and over-the-top, the Mentalist, Patrick Jane, comes off as suave and intriguing. You never quite know whether you can trust him completely, as he deals with his personal demons along with the murders in each episode. Each episode in this first season has a reference to the color red in the title, reminding you that the overarching story involves Jane's motivation for working with the team.

The Mentalist is also the only crime show in which I care about every member of the police team. I eagerly look forward to the snatches of development for each of the characters as they progress through the cases. It's got plenty of humor, but it's somewhat subtler than you'd find in Psych. Jane is quirky and nontraditional in his crime-solving, and it often puts his team in awkward situations, which they then manage to get out of in unusual ways. It's my favorite show on TV right now (and not even in my typical genre), and I can't wait til the DVD is released. I hope there's plenty more to come.",1242345600,9,1392,4.54183266932271
3518298,5,B001CTDH76,"The Mentalist is one of those shows where you can kind of miss one episode and still be caught up. It's kind of the same in every episode, like Scooby-Doo, but the tricks Patrick Jane uses, are different. See Patrick Jane(Simon Baker) used to be a fake Psychic, but after he insulted a serial killer on television, the serial killer basically slayed his wife and his daughter. He gave up that life to help out the CBI solve cases with his extraordinary abilities to read deep into a situation. He can hypnotize people, and he also tricks people into telling him what he wants to know. He can do things that no ordinary person can do. While he's helping the CBI, he's on his own search for Red John, the serial killer. Patrick is very tortured and he protects his inner self with much difficulty. He puts up a front, to protect people from seeing the pain he's under. Simon Baker plays the part well, having a similar part with The Guardian. Simon Baker is amazing, and Robin Tunney (Agent Lisbon) and the others, help support the roles excellent. If you want a good detective type show, without all the flashbacks and gore like CSI, this is great for you.
Enjoy!",1241740800,11,1162,4.511848341232228
3518299,5,B001CTDH76,"Lately we've been bombarded with alot of new shows. It's hard not to like alot of them with all the technology that is available as apposed to the 70's and 80's when we had to put up with corny writing and shoddy effects. Still, they bring back the nostalgia, that we crave so bad ! Well nowadays we have alot better writing and ALOT better effects, this show has some of both. my wife and I and even our teenage daughters love it. Soon as it comes out we will be buying it. Simon Baker is a great talant and was a superb choice to play the guy that all the guys wish they were and all the woman kinda wish they were with. admit it! Watch a couple of episodes and you'll be hooked too!!!
p.s....Cho, is another great charactor ! Greatly portrayed by Tim Kang, kinda reminds us a little of Joe Friday maybe ? Anyway, ENJOY !",1241222400,8,823,4.15
3518300,5,B001CTDH76,Another light-hearted investigative drama along the lines of Bones or The Closer. Good ensemble cast. Main character w a special talent. And an emotional back story that gives the series lots of heart.,1238112000,25,201,5.121212121212121
3518301,1,B001CTDH76,This is nothing more then a ripoff of USA Networks much better show 'Psych'. Don't bother.,1237852800,16,90,4.6875
3518302,4,B001CTDH76,"This TV show, in its first season, is, like ""Life,"" a police procedural with lots of flavor--in this case, a former phony psychic who, years ago, talking insultingly about a serial killer on his psychic TV show.

The killer was watching the show, apparently, took offense, and proceeded to murder the guy's entire family.

After much soul searching, our hero quit his pseudoprofession and now works with a police agency doing for crimes what Gregory House does for his hospital--solving the cases no one else can solve. He uses his ability to read people and situations that stood him in good stead during his stint as a phony psychic.

Of course, like the cop in ""Life"" his merry, mischievous exterior conceals an iron core of permanent, near-psychotic rage. The Mentalist works with the police agency he works for in order to find the serial killer to killed his family, and he has told his boss there, in merry seriousness, that if/when he finds the guy, he will take him apart in a way Dexter (as in the HBO series) would admire.

All this is backstory. No spoilers, as I promised. There's considerable interaction with his boss, her boss, and the three person team that also works with the boss, and they're all competently played, seemingly pretty much credible as detectives.

So both this and ""Life"" have:

1. fine actor in the lead role--with ""The Mentalist,"" Aussie heartthrob Simon Baker, who every woman appears to find irresistable (according to my wife).

2. multilayered plot, with an ongoing story arc on top of the case du jour, and evolving relationships among the team members.

3. light and shadow--lots of comic moments alongside very dark stuff indeed. In painting this would be called chiaroscuro (think Rembrandt paintings of interiors illuminated by candles).

If you like ""Life"" I'm certain you'll like ""The Mentalist"" even if the more run of the mill procedurals (all the CSIs for example) don't appeal to you. I'd also put ""Bones"" in this category FWIW.

And this is about as good as we can expect until Joss Whedon's next show shows up (presumably ""Dollhouse"" with Eliza Dushku, herself a master of chiaroscuro).",1230595200,127,2141,4.889502762430939

As the other series intensify, and very justifiably pull you in to the smartest man in the room, Patrick Jane, as he gets his revenge on the ""cad""!!",1494720000,,315,4.448275862068965
3518435,5,B001CTDH76,"Sometimes the directing can be a little bit too artsy with their weird closeup shots with no context, but overall this show is amazing. The acting is wonderful. I am partial to the actress who plays Lisbon, who does a phenomenal job of playing a ""pocket rocket"" and ""angry princess"", as so lovingly coined by Patrick Jane. I am also very fond of Cho's character, the serious no-nonsense cop on the team who balances out everyone else very well. I thought the actor did a really good job portraying an almost robotic cop but giving him lots of human qualities, making the character relatable and likeable.

The mysteries are great, and I love that there is a balance between physical evidence and the psychology of the human mind. Ever since I discovered Agatha Christie's Poirot last year (I know, I know), I have been addicted to that kind of mystery and this show feeds that addiction. I have also been craving for a show to replace Psych after it ended a few years ago, and this show is the perfect replacement.

The Red John story from episode one is compelling and disturbing. The show starts off light-hearted but turns very serious by the end of the episode. It definitely caught my attention and left me no choice but to bingewatch the entire season!",1492992000,4,1258,4.63677130044843

3518635,5,B001CTDH76,"Echoing other reviewers, this series is engaging, entertaining, well-paced (generally), sometimes whimsical and rarely overly serious  in many ways a throwback to shows from the 1960-70s.  The basic premise: Simon Baker portrays Patrick Jane; a mentalist, con man and faux-psychic whose wife and daughter were murdered by a serial killer in retaliation for a perceived slight. To pursue the killer and exact revenge, Jane works as a consultant to the fictional California Bureau of Investigation, using his powers of observation, analysis and psychological manipulation to solve homicides.  The CBI homicide team is comprised of a solid ensemble cast, led by Senior Agent Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney), who has the thankless  and generally impossible - task of keeping Janes scams and ploys barely within the limits of the law.

Ive watched portions of The Mentalist on network television and Im finally working through the entire series - in order - while indoor cycling. The first season begins roughly a year after Jane joins the CBI and his past is slowly revealed over the next three seasons. The freshman season takes a few episodes to find its footing, but reaches its stride by Episode 1x14 (Crimson Casanova), one of my favorite episodes.  The DVD set appears to be standard retail packaging  Ive watched the entire season and each disc worked well.  Overall, a really entertaining package  well worth the price.",1473811200,5,1420,5.192982456140351

However, this is a good series because of the investment in the characters. The overarching story lines and the characters' background stories are great. I high recommend it.",1470096000,,293,5.125
3518670,2,B001CTDH76,"We watched the first few and don't think we'll watch any more.  The acting is OK, not great.  The plots are lame.  Much of it is impossible and lacking depth and details.",1469923200,,170,4.25
3518671,3,B001CTDH76,"The main character is charming, but he is also so smug that even his cute quirks, Jonny Depp waistcoats and sad back-story aren't enough to make me not want to slap him upside the head.

While it's still a fun mystery/ murder of the week cop show to tuck into, I just can't in good conscience pay twice as much to watch one season of this as I do Hulu and Netflix.

More shows on Prime please.",1469664000,,393,4.090909090909091

3518684,5,B001CTDH76,I've watched all the seasons so far and am going back doing reviews.  This is a terrific series; haven't found anything like it.  Simon Baker fits the role perfectly.  It's contemporary but avoids cheapening the relationships - friendly or romantic.,1469145600,,249,5.175
3518685,5,B001CTDH76,"I have been a long-time fan of this series and was finally glad to find at a decent price, to add to my dvd library. I do not watch too many of these procedural-type shows, but I was hooked on this one from the start, as it has a refreshing and different take on things, let's just say it's not your typical or run-of-the-mill cop show. Another thing liked about the show, even though, I didn't watch every single episode, every single week, during its run,when I did watch, I never felt like I didn't know what was going on, at least not in terms of the overall story.",1468972800,2,569,4.229357798165138

3518690,5,B001CTDH76,"One of my favorite tv series. simon baker is one of my favorite actors. He also stared in ""The Guardian"" (2001 - 2003,)  a three year cbs tv show available on amazon prime streaming video (and netflix)  that i think is EVEN BETTER. The last couple of years of the 7 year mentalist series was bad. It sort of ruined the whole series. They should have stopped it after redjohn. But the first years were exceptional. As yet, the first year is the only year available on bluray. this show is similar to ""Monk"", in that some of his 'tricks' are really authentic common mind games. i also object to the respect given to the fbi, but it's tv and you have to try to go with the flow. every time i turn it on, i am reminded that if i watch this incorrectly, i can be prosecuted for a felony by the fbi, then i have to forget that and make myself make believe i can still root for the fbi good guys. i find that a little more irritating than i can forgive. this is as good as legal tv can get in this day and age. Good resolution and picture quality. its a quality disc with good sound. will likely stay permanently in my video library. good for my lifetime collection. Robin Tunney is good too. I liked her first in ""The Craft"". i think her best work was the little indie ""CHERISH"" (2002,) which i also recommend.",1468281600,,1304,4.191235059760956

I was disappointed when they finally revealed the nemesis.  That's what happens when you write scripts without having a clear outline of who that nemesis is, who should portray him, and how he fits in the grand scheme of things.

Everything about it made it fun to watch, from the complexity of the characters, to the heart-warming loyalty of their friendships, to the slight playful romances brewing that leave you hopeful for more, witty humor, appealing settings, and great crime-solving with conclusions that were not obvious and different than any other crime-solving show out there. Guys and girls alike will love this show, there is truly something for everyone. I highly, HIGHLY recommend buying the entire series and watching it all in order, it is worth every penny and provides hours and hours of captivating yet clean entertainment. This first season has so many episodes! But you will still be wanting more, it is that good. In fact each season gets better and better so definitely don't stop after watching season one.

Patrick is a character he uses his child and most of his adulthood experiences to help solve crimes, he gives up the con life to catch his wife and daughters killer. He is still a con he just use it for good. Yet you can still see he is very tourtered soul. Watch laugh,cry get hooked. You will not be disappointed",1439856000,2,625,4.1652892561983474

Although not an officer of the law, he uses skills from his former career as a successful, yet admittedly fraudulent, psychic medium to help a team of CBI agents solve murders. The real reason for Patrick Jane's involvement with law enforcement is to track down the serial killer known as Red John, who was responsible for the brutal murders of his wife and his daughter.",1432080000,,534,5.079545454545454

3518922,5,B001CTDH76,This show is different then the usual cop procedural. Simon Baker makes you laugh with his bizarre take on crime solving.  This once phony physic has decided to give it all up and help the police find a serial killer that also killed his wife and daughter.  This show is both witty and unique.

Is it entirely factual? No. Are the characters consistent? Not always. Will it keep you interested? Almost definitely. Despite a slightly gruesome premise, The Mentalist doesn't take itself TOO seriously. Sometimes, that doesn't quite work out--I'm looking at you, Russet Potatoes--but most of the time, it does. The show is fun, its titular character is smart, and its mysteries are more often than not interesting. You may not walk away hungry for season two, but you certainly won't leave disappointed.",1430092800,2,603,5.216494845360825

It also appears that the actors speak so fast that their enunciation is mushed.  I wish that they had analyzed that as they were taping the scenes and improved that aspect as they filmed it.  As my husband and I watched, we kept asking each other ""what did he/she say?"".  So some of the plot we have to either suppose or form our own take on the plot.

Great acting and brilliant story telling. Unlike most police/crime shows you'll come to care deeply for these well crafted characters. Simon Baker is a fabulous actor. He is so handsome people tend to not give him the credit he deserves. He simply is Patrick Jane. Who is charming yet troubled. Heartbroken and yet given to whimsical moments levity. Robin Tunney is given the difficult task of dealing with Jane and his unorthodox methods. She does so with a great wit and charm of her own. If you are looking for a great show The Mentalist is a winner. It deserved better than all the CBS/ WB politics.,1418947200,6,768,4.696296296296296

3519085,5,B001CTDH76,"Mentalist - First Season [0568 - 09-09-2014 - DVD] I'm Mental for the Mentalist!

Summary:
  This is a police procedural show featuring murder investigations. As such we are introduced to the murdered ""subject"" at the start of each episode.
  A unique and very intriguing aspect of this show accounts for its popularity and long network run - the mentalist Patrick Jane as played by Simon Baker. Mr. Jane in a prior life was a fraudulent spiritualist whose wife and child were brutally murders by ""Red John"" who called him out as a fraud. Jane renounces his bogus avocation and is employed as a consultant with the CBI - California Bureau of Investigation - a squad of 4 cracker jack detectives that play extremely well off of Jane's smarty personality. Jane has an acknowledged agenda - he want to avenge the killer of his family - ""Red John"".
.

Content & Packaging:
6 disks - 23 episodes - Comes in a solid, standard, snap case - a handy booklet with cast photos and episode summaries included - a cardboard box with artwork -  a few interesting features on disk 6.

Positive Comments:
 One can only marvel at the witty and insightful encounters and dialog with Jane and the CBI crew. Accolades to the writers of this show.
 Simon Baker as Patrick Jane is a reason to watch this show. His laid back informality and unorthodox procedures when solving the weekly murders are arresting.
 The back-story and interactions of the 4 CBI investigators add rather than detract to the shows appeal.
 The show walks a fine line between humor and pathos and successfully pulls it off without being cute.
 In several episodes Jane show a deep and heart felt compassion for children in stressful sistuations. I found this very appealing and realistic.

The Cast:
 As the season progressed I noticed that the strengths and weaknesses of each CBI member was drawn out by gestures, casual remarks and actions under stress. A very talents group of actors indeed.

Negative Comments:
 Sometimes I find Jane's mentalist routines forced and over the top.
 A very few episodes had one deleted scene. I enjoy watching deleted scenes and have usually found them to be interesting and informative. I don't understand why there weren't more of them.
 Although Patrick Jane admits he was a fraud and that the whole concept is bogus when he encounters an individuals who claim ""mystical powers"" he give them the benefit of the doubt - this does not ring true to this viewer.
 My negative comments are picky and do not detract from the quality of the show.

Recommendations:
This is a well-crafted and thoughtful show and if the material interests you I recommend it.",1410480000,,2641,4.785871964679911

Jane is a bit emotionally immature in his overconfidence. He does fine with clients, but his work relationships are annoying. The other work characters lack depth. Jane's costuming and coif are attractive, and Baker does it all justice with his acting skills. What really turns me off about the show is the distastefulness of the crimes and criminals. Bad enough there are people like this in the real world. So this show is really a disappointment compared to the ""bildungsroman"" nature of ""The Guardian"" that had real depth and true tragic appeal not unlike ""The Lives of Others"" and ""Crime and Punishment"".",1393632000,,730,4.943089430894309

I had hoped that this First Season would finally show me the full Pilot, or have these scenes as part of the First Season, since it was advertised as containing the Pilot in the series.
It doesn't.  It just starts out with Jane already working for the CBI, with no background to speak of in any of the episodes.

So my solution was to jump onto ROKU & buy 1 episode at a time via Amazon Instant Video's :)

  ""Well"" (I hear you thinking), ""maybe just ONE season."" Fool not yourself, Gentle Viewer. Simply bite the bullet and buy all four. Today. Right now. For one thing, they are a joy to watch sans commercials.

  I'm sure those who've managed to find their way here unaided know enough about the cast and particulars to go on with, and they have probably already figured out that the show is stunningly brilliant. Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes in modern garb with a twist, but it is so much more.

  THE MENTALIST, in fact, lays almost every icon and cliche of the whole mystery/crime genre on its ear, and, in some cases, goes them all one better. Just one ""for instance"" will suffice (half the fun is searching out the others): there are two variations (so far) on MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. In addition, there are elements from many and diverse television dramas of the past, from THE FUGITIVE and PERRY MASON and THE AVENGERS to (""Patience, Grasshopper"") STAR TREK. Yes, STAR TREK (Kimball Cho as Spock?). Bruno Heller knows - as did Gene Roddenberry - that an audience needs a cast they can care about, which means a group of well developed characters who care about each other.

  I'm not sure Mr. Heller did all this on purpose, mind you (Well.......), but the fact is that some of THE MENTALIST episodes - to say nothing of the seasons themselves - have as many layers and contain as many traditions as the HARRY POTTER novels, including Jane Austen's penchant for misdirection, but it is certainly great fun thinking along those lines whether or not.

  And really, what more can we ask. The series IS great fun. Treat yourself and buy it. Watch it with friends who are unfamiliar and not yet addicted. You will NOT be sorry.",1360713600,,1903,4.672672672672673

3519365,5,B001CTDH76,"In The Mentalist, the main character is Patrick Jane (Simon Baker) played with intelligence, charm, coyness and an almost childlike demeanor. Patrick, or Jane, as he's know by his colleagues, is on a mission to kill the nefarious serial killer Red John who murdered his wife and daughter. Jane is frequently asked, ""Are you a psychic?"" His reply is always, ""There's no such thing as psychic's."" His dislike of psychic's comes from the good living he used to make as a fake psychic and the tragic mistake he made by doing a psychic reading describing Red John on television. Jane is consumed with guilt because that appearance angered Red John and he killed Jane's family in retribution. A mentalist is, someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion. A master manipulator of thoughts and behavior. Jane, because of his previous experiences and instinctive mental capacity is a powerful mentalist and he uses his talents as a consultant for the CBI (California Bureau of Investigation.) The cockiness and forthrightness he sometimes displays is kept in check by Senior Agent Theresa Lisbon, played masterfully by Robin Tunney. Lisbon and Jane have a complex relationship. At times they are like brother and sister or mother and son, always there for each other with an unspoken respect and perhaps an underlying love. Jane may seem to be wandering around a house or crime scene, but all the while he is taking in information and sizing up the suspects. His crime fighting style is unorthodox, humorous, confounding and sometimes rude. Helping to weed out the villains are Tim Kang as Agent Kimball Cho, Owain Yeoman as Agent Wayne Rigsby and Amanda Righetti as Agent Grace Van Pelt. They all share a camaraderie that resembles a symphony orchestra. None of them is in tune with their jobs without each other. Jane goes with the team to investigate and solve all of the murders assigned to the CBI, but his driving force is to find Red John and have his revenge, that is, to kill him. The furtive longing between Rigsby and Van Pelt is handled with finesse. The plots have twists and turns, sometimes intertwining and always entertaining. The Mentalist is so much more than, let's get the bad guys. It's a delight to watch and to wonder what comes next but, don't try too hard because you'll never guess what it is. I recommend The Mentalist to anyone who enjoys a good crime show or anyone who likes eye candy. Simon Baker will supply you with plenty of that.",1356048000,2,2470,4.827830188679245
3519366,5,B001CTDH76,"The premise is unique and the characters intriguing.  Although there is a long term, underlying plot development (Red John), I like that not every episode attempts to advance the underlying plot.  I also like that the romantic entanglements of the two main characters is kept to a minimum and unintrusive.  Simon Baker is great in this role.  He is flawed, not perfect but a really good guy.  He is not intimidated by wealth and we chuckle when he takes the obnoxious, arrogant (often wealthy), and just plain wicked down a peg.

Best series on prime time in a very, very long time.",1356048000,,582,4.6568627450980395

I would have to say my favorite episode from the season is the episode set at a corporate retreat. The prologue was fantastic! I hope this show lasts a long time and that CBS doesn't cancel it before the Red John story is wrapped. It would be horrible not to at least give this show a fitting closure.,1354752000,,440,4.5125
3519386,2,B001CTDH76,"The biggest problem I have with the Mentalist is that I saw the Guardian first.  That show was superior in almost every respect to The Mentalist; cast chemistry, setting, acting skills of the guest actors, social relavance, even the wordrobes.  The show is as current today as it was when it aired and most of the cast characters are compelling and for the most part, believable.  Bakers performance and chemistry with his costars is amazing.
In contrast, I found the Mentalist to be another mediocre network show.  I am disapointed that Heller does not make use of Bakers mastery of non-verbal communication and body language.  Baker glides through the show chatty, smiling and flirty; odd when you think that he just lost his wife and child to a serial killer.  The supporting cast characters are flat, and do we really need another Cali cop show?
Considering the show has run for 5 seasons, I thought it would get more compelling, so I streamed a few episodes of Season 5.  It was like watching a soap opera. Nothing really changed, so I can't see spending almost $200 to buy all four seasons.  I can totally set this show aside.  Additionally, I found that numerous episodes are not HD, so why spend the extra money?",1354406400,12,1220,4.690140845070423

3519389,4,B001CTDH76,"I'll admit it, TV commercials are over the top, I'm trying an experiment where I basically chuck cable in favor of netflix and amazon.  Came across this, during a TBS marathon (I think that was the station), and so bought a couple of episodes in season 4, and am currently subscribed to season 5.

For those unfamiliar, Patrick Jane, was a mentalist, talked to the dead for people (was running a scam as there is no thing as a psychic - Jane repeated ad nausem).

Red John kills his family, for no other reason apparently than he didn't care for Jane acting like he knew him on a TV show.

Year in loony bin, then off to work for the cops as a consultant.

Again, if you go through the episodes, there's some serious logic gaps;

Red John's cohorts kill off an office of police officers and yet they pretty much drop it in 5 minutes.  No massive police effort, no ongoing interest by anyone really than Jane.

and Red John.... doesn't appear to be ANY logic behind the man, although he is connected to everyone and his mother.

Still all in all the cast is a good ensemble cast, the murder per episodes are at least marginally entertaining.

And I have to say the first episode of this last season had me laughing out loud at the antics.

There's some silliness with ""Lorelei"" who is supposed to be a known conspirator with Red John.

Leave your logic at the door, kick it into neutral and let it pull you along for a fairly decent ride.

Likely the best I've seen that is still generating new episodes this season.",1353369600,,1515,4.387096774193548

But just as there's some good scenes worth of a laugh, there's some depressing ones, they are just so well balanced I love it, it's perfect. The main character usually shows a great honesty that if found charming, because he uses some sarcastic remarks sometimes and it is straightforward most of the time.

We see: ""The Mentalist"" is a false medium that at first works as an artist. Later it happens the tragedy of the crimes of ""Red John"" but that I think doesn't matters  anybody: it's only another more of these infinite serial killers it seems the USA is plenty today and an excuse to introduce Patrick Jane in the world of the police.
There, it's curious, as is evident sex roles are changed: beautiful chief Teresa Lisbon behaves as a man, she's externally hard, uses violence and carries a gun. Instead, Patrick Jane is soft and polite, but this is the case he ever ends in mocking from Teresa. I don't know if The Mentalist has paranormal powers, but he's extravagant,  falsely weak and clever and also deeply amoral, as I think at bottom, police actions and human justice simply are themes that truly doesn't matter to him. He's only obsessed with the capture of Red John, or mostly, with killing him as pure vengeance out of justice.
But between all this plot, there are  characters and situations unusual in other telefilms, deeply human and I think real, generally played by secondary people. Excellent and original series plenty of humor.",1327622400,,1281,4.840182648401827
3519443,4,B001CTDH76,"I have always loved crime shows and I can say this is one of the best.  Most detective shows are so grim and gorry that they leave you depressed.  Not so with The Mentalist, though it has gorry crime scenes and there are heartbreaking mysteries to solve, this show incorporates humor to lighten the mood at all the right spots.  I would say this show is similar to Lie to Me because of Jane Patrik who is a man who is good at reading body language, facial expressions etc to tell when someone is lying.  He is a person who used to pretend to be a phsychic but when his wife and daughter are brutally murdered by Red John he walks away from that life convinced that there are no such thing as phsychics because he himself was a fraud.  It is a show that keeps me wanting to go on to the next episode and see what Jane will do next.  However I will say that it is a bit unrealistic as to how easily he solves the crimes with almost no help from his collegues.  Still, it is a show worth watching.",1327190400,,994,4.092783505154639
3519444,5,B001CTDH76,"I use the word ""psuedo"" because it appears that the usual procedures are rarely adhered to in this show, but that is its greatest appeal. I came across this show watching reruns on TNT and fell in love with it. What a cast of characters. The stories are fairly typical murders but the way Patrick and his cohorts go about solving the cases are very entertaining. The entire cast is superb with Simon Baker as Jane, Robin Tunney as the leader, and Amanda Righetti,Tim Kang and Owain Yeoman rounding out the cast. They all bring their characters to life with wit and charm. There is just enough of sexual tension between Agent Lisbon (Tunney) and Patrick (Baker)to keep everyone guessing what will happen between them and their repartee is quite amusing.

This show is not meant to be taken seriously. Although there are some serious episodes and the history of Patrick Jane is sad, the episodes are mostly played for the understated and subdued humor. The only actor here that I have seen before is Robin Tunney who has made many movies and a very fine actress. But the other supporting players bring a fresh dynamic to the show. Without giving away anything the basic premise is that the team is after a very bad serial killer called Red John. This story thread is touched however slightly in nearly every episode.

I like this show enough to purchase all three seasons that are currently available. I look forward to Season 4 on DVD. Highly recommended.",1325548800,3,1454,4.698039215686275

3519452,5,B001CTDH76,"Unlike Teresa Gisbon who prefers a very methodical approach to solving cases, Patrick Jane takes a different tack.  He looks for the motive behind the murders with his finely-honed cold reading skills. As we are introduced to him, Jane solves a case in under five minutes. He is placed on suspension as the culprit is fatally shot, but we soon see that he was quickly vindicated once the evidence was collected.

Red John features prominently in three episodes, and there is strong chemistry between Wayne Rigsby and Grace van Pelt (not to mention a traumatic experience between Jane and Gisbon during the season's climactic episode).

Outside these episodes, there are themes of revenge, murder, obstruction of justice, child abuse, and aggressive paternalism. They are all worth watching, and it is always fun to try to solve the mystery before Jane does. It's not always easy (indeed, it's often excruciatingly difficult) to catch all the clues before the killer is revealed.

I have not watched the extra features at this time, having been too absorbed in the storylines (overarching and episodic), but this set would be worth purchasing in any case. Highly recommended.",1312675200,,1174,5.098958333333333
3519453,5,B001CTDH76,"I couldn't get enough of the antics of Simon Baker as Patrick Jane, using his powers of observation (as opposed to his former  fake psychic abilities) to help  reveal clues for his team to solve cases. Much to the embarrassment of many suspects lives (and lies) and also ""innocent bystanders.""  And lead agent, Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney) is always in control, but wondering what tricks Jane ""has up his sleeve,"" and what orders he isn't going to follow or ignore. Sometimes dragging one or all of her team members with him, working on a hunch, or just being insubordinate. Because he really isn't a cop, ""Just a Consultant"" -  he really doesn't have to follow rules or anyone's orders. Or so he thinks.

There are many light-hearted scenes, interspersed with the serious parts of crime-solving. Agents Cho (Tim Kang) and Rigsby (Owain Yeoman) can be crack-ups as they interact. Cho, being the serious one, and Rigsby the ""Get it?"" ""I don't get it?"" guy. Rigbsy also being in love with Agent Van Pelt (Amanda Righetti - See episode ""Russet Potatoes""), the rookie who to wants to prove herself, and believes in the life hereafter, as opposed to Jane's atheistic view.

I liked the fact that some episodes conclude with somewhat sappy, happy endings (with Jane's help), and others with darker, more somber endings; reminding Jane of the deaths of his family at the hand of Red John. And also Jane reflecting on his obsession with finding and killing Red John, and whether it will make any difference to the emptiness in his life; knowing it won't bring his family back.  The dialogue between Lisbon and Jane in the final moments of the season ending finale (see episode ""Red John's Footsteps"") is both haunting and touching.  Excellent writing, acting, directing and mood music.

3519455,5,B001CTDH76,"I bought this season because I had seen a few episodes on television and the show seemed pretty interesting. I wanted to get into it, but I wanted to start from the beginning since the serial killer Red John is recurring and integral to the story as a whole. I absolutely did not regret this purchase, and would in fact recommend this show highly to anyone. The best comparison I can make is if Bones merged with House, although Patrick Jane is a much more likeable character than House in my opinion.

As before mentioned, the show essentially revolves around Jane, an ex-psychic/con artist, and the serial killer, Red John, who killed Jane's wife and daughter. In the first season, they give you just the right balance of revealing interactions between Jane and John while leaving out just enough to keep you wanting more! The script is well written and witty, and all of the characters are very distinct and likeable. It is also very refreshing to see a show where the main male and female protagonists aren't really ""love interests"". It's pretty obvious that Jane and the main CBI agent, Lisbon, have some chemistry, but it is by no means a main point in the story. It's just sort of there for intrigue and could even be chocked up to just Platonic love for each other. Still, there is that drama between another pair of agents, Rigsby and van Pelt, which is very satisfying and will entertain those who desire the drama in their show.

Overall, I'd say this show would satisfy just about any audience! It has drama, crime, comedy, love, serial killers, witty dialogue, intriguing characters, and overall well-written script. For how cheap it is on Amazon, I would say that you simply cannot lose by getting this season on DVD!",1309824000,,1731,4.690789473684211

3519458,5,B001CTDH76,"'The Mentalist' is a rare gem in the procedural-show genre. It's not as scientific as 'CSI' or 'House' nor as realistic as 'The Wire' or even 'Law and Order'. What 'The Mentalist' lacks in realism and work-bound logic it makes up for with entertainment value, using the likeability and charm of it's characters and plot to carry each episode.  I wasn't sure what to think about this show going in, but after watching this first season DVD set I have to say 'The Mentalist' is one of the most engaging shows on TV.

After the death of his wife and child at the hands of serial killer 'Red John' (whom he publically mocked), celebrity psychic Patrick Jane admitted to being a fraud and is now a consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation (a fiction version of the real CBI). Joined by senior agent Lisbon, the dry-humored agent Cho, the spiritual newbie agent Van Pelt, and the likeably insecure agent Rigsby, Jane uses his abilities in observation and deduction (cold-reading and even hypnotism) to help the team solve homicides. Most of the plots play out episodically with Jane's vengeful search for the killer 'Red John' popping up here and there as the series goes on. Each episode is convoluted enough to be interesting and each self-contained story is resolved in a beliveable manner (with some moral ambiguity) and not always with easy solutions. This show wisely doesn't judge it's characters or situations (for the most part) allowing the audience to sometimes judge things for themselves.

One of the best parts of 'The Mentalist' is watching how the characters interact and the cast really sells it. Simon Baker is very charismatic as Jane and his performance is so finely tuned (check out how his eyes dilate in close-ups) you'd swear you were watching a real mentalist at work. Robin Tunney has her best role in Senior Agent Lisbon, someone who's annoyed by Jane's arrogance but respects him as a colleuge and even trusts him as a friend. Tim Kang is dead-pan (and very funny) as the down-to-earth Agent Cho. Amanda Righetti is perfect as the spiritual Van Pelt, a great contrast to Jane's methodical approach to psychic-abilities. Welsh actor Owain Yeoman is fun to watch as the likeable Rigsby, especially with him trying to keep a relationship with Van Pelt. Most of these characters do fit some archetype of the procedural show, but there's enough unique (and again, believable) about each one that each episode is a pleasure to watch.

While it might not seem like a big deal, the one thing that really sets 'The Mentalist' apart is it's filming on location all around California. We're not stuck in enclosed labs or hospital rooms, no claustrophobic office spaces to try and sell realism. Each location in the show is visually appealing like you're taking a road trip with these characters. It's nice when a show can stretch it's legs and NOT make you feel like you're just watching people work. That 'The Mentalist' still manages to keep it's believability is impressive indeed.

I keep mentioning the 'believability' in 'The Mentalist' but I'm by no means saying it's realistic, in fact it has a lot of the same pitfalls as other procedurals: The actors are obviously way too attractive to be in this profession (especially the way the they dress), Jane gets away with breaking the rules (and being a jerk) waaaaay too much, side-characters seem too dense (especially other law-enforcement officers) and for a procedural show there's almost no PROCEDURE involved (no clear-cut laws or rules to follow). Even the idea of using a fake-psychic isn't exactly original ('Psych' anyone?).

'The Mentalist', created by Bruno Heller (who also created HBO's excellent 'ROME' series) is far from the most realistic and original show on TV. However it's crafted much better than just about any other procedural out there (the BBC's Sherlock comes the closest in my mind) and it's clever stories, appealing locales and charming characters make it perfect escapist entertainment. A real winner and one of the best shows on TV!",1301702400,,4044,4.930983847283406
3519459,2,B001CTDH76,"Hi,

Like anyone reading this review I really enjoy ""The Mentalist."" The show is exciting and humorous. Plus the character of Patrick Jane has a legendary smirk.

My issue is the main menu screen. There are no options. No choice of episode selection. No settings. Nothing. You have to play all the episodes. If you are looking for a specific episode you must fast forward to find them. It is really strange and frustrating.

It seems rather ironic to me that a show based on mental acuity can't seem to make a normal menu screen. That is a bit mental.

Simon Baker is perfect in the role of Patrick Jane - a clown with a broken heart. He is a 3-dimensional character, something you just don't see in other series. Watch a few episodes and you can write Jane's biography, complete with motivations. You feel for him and want him to achieve the revenge he seeks, while laughing at his clever crime-solving antics.

3519479,5,B001CTDH76,"The Mentalist is a show about a special police force in California (so they can travel all over and not be stuck in one city) and the consultant who helps them out using skills from his former career as a ""fake Psychic"". The reason why he does this is part of the story, so I won't go into that here.

This is an ensemble cast show, with each character playing off of one or more of the other characters. This is what makes the show good. Rigsby is the ""Yes, Boss."" man; Cho is the straight/blunt man, with a little look-the-other-way thrown in; Van Pelt is the move up the ladder wanna be, everything is supposed to be a certain way gal; Lisbon is the wants-to-do-it-by-the-book leader, with the realization that life doesn't always work that way; and Jane is the Maverick consultant. The combination works well, and even if the particular storyline happens to be weak in any particular episode, just watching the character interactions is entertaining.

My only complaint is that the directors/writers spoon feed you the clues. There has not been single episode where I didn't know who did it before it was finished (usually less than half way), and some of the proposed explanations could be slightly different and still fit the clues (although there was one episode that had me gong until 3/4 of the way through).  It would be nice if the cameras didn't swing and focus on a particular item, rather passed over it along with 1000 other possible clues. It's kind of like slapping you in the face and saying ""Look, here's a clue!!!""  I do like that occasionally Jane misses something or they show a chink in his facade.

Do you have to suspend reality a bit for an hour sometimes, sure. But for those of us with a slight vigilante bent, the means are not always over the top. The cast interaction is enjoyable, and every once in a while I have to think and might actually learn something, which is a good thing.",1286841600,,1913,4.549418604651163

I came across ""The Mentalist"", but had never seen or even heard of it.  After reading the blurb on the box, I thought it might be interesting, but also thought ""eh..."" and put it back on the shelf.  I was a little leery because I have checked out other TV series with which I was unfamiliar and ended up being disappointed.  However, after failing to find anything that looked more interesting, I grabbed ""Mentalist"" and checked it out.

I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised by this series.  My husband was watching the pilot episode with me and both of us were immediately drawn into the story.  It was fascinating and that same fascination continued through every single episode in this season.  I didn't think any of the stories were boring or dragged at all.  Simon Baker, who plays Patrick Jane--the mentalist and lead character with a tragic past--is a critical reason for the success of this series, in my opinion.  He plays his character with humor, charm, and an exuberance that is highly enjoyable to watch.  The fact that he's good looking doesn't hurt either. :D

As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the formula for this series reminds me of a law-enforcement version of ""House""--but only in the sense that it centers around a highly unique, off-beat, fascinating character with an uncanny ability to see things and solve mysteries that no one else can quite figure out.  Unlike House, Baker's character has a well-mannered, smooth charm.  This and the way he is always several steps ahead of everyone else also reminds me of Aloysius Pendergast--the FBI Agent character who features prominently in the novels by Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston.

Additionally appealing is the interplay amongst the main characters.  Despite the fact the mentalist is the key character, the others are written in such a way that they are integral to the show.  All are good actors, as well.  The stories are highly creative and interesting, the dialogue is great, and it's entertaining to try and figure out who committed the crimes.  It is also quite clean with almost no bad language (I love the fact that they say ""crap""--I think it's hilarious) and very little raunchiness.

3519486,4,B001CTDH76,"The Mentalist is a smart, dramedic semi-procedural that features an investigative team for the California Bureau of Investigation and their permanent consultant, a mentalist [Patrick Jane] who pretended to be psychic - and whose wife and daughter were murdered by a serial killer he angered with an unctious profile on live TV.

The cast - Simon Baker [Patrick Jane], Robin Tunney [Senior Agent Teresa Lisbon], Tim Kang [Agent Kimball Cho], Owain Yeoman [Agent Wayne Rigsby] and Amanda Righetti [Agent Grace Van Pelt] - is as solid as any on TV.

The actual series is a first-rate whodunnit that uses the CBI team's investigative skills to allow Jane the opportunity to observe and improvise - resulting in the solution of the crime [usually murder]. Occasionally in the foreground - but always in the background - is the spectre of the serial koller, Red John, and Jane's desire to find him and kill him. Despite the darkness surrounding the Red John arc, the show is usually fairly breezy, always smart and enjoyable - especially when Jane and Agent Lisbon are bantering.

Features include: deleted scenes [Lost Evidence] for three key episodes; Gag Reel [actually pretty funny]; Evidence of a Hit Series [interviews of cast and creative team] and Cracking the Crystal Ball: Mentalist vs. Psychic. There are no audio commentary tracks and only the Evidence of a Hit Series featurette can be considered a quality feature.

I find it a really refreshing change to the intensity of shows like CSI and Law and Order (both of which I also enjoy) I look forward to the next series

3519514,2,B001CTDH76,"Los amantes de las series de suspenso, sean de investigaci&oacute;n privada o policial, esperan sorpresas, caminos nuevos y que la tensi&oacute;n en cada cap&iacute;tulo vaya subiendo se acuerdo a la conocida secuencia de ""hilo, nudo y desenlace"". En mi opini&oacute;n, The Mentalist (1ra. Temporada) carece de ello. Incluso si uno la considerara dentro del g&eacute;nero intermedio de la ""comedia policial"" (en el que se encuentra, por ejemplo, Bones), se la siente ins&iacute;pida y carente de imaginaci&oacute;n.

Cuando pienso en un mentalista lo asocio de inmediato a un ilusionista, al estilo del personaje de Harlequin, aquella maravillosa pel&iacute;cula inglesa con Robert Powell, Carmen Duncan, David Hemmings y Broderick Crawford, y siento que The Mentalist se encuentra a ""a&ntilde;os luz"" de ella.

3519524,4,B001CTDH76,"I didn't get into this show until about halfway through the season, and then it was only out of idle curiosity.  I am glad I did.  I won't waste your time with what it's about--you probably already know that--and get directly into why I like it.

Why I like it is the character of Patrick Jane.  I've been watching TV and movies regularly for 20 years now, and I can honestly say I do not have him figured out.  While it would be easy to dismiss his motives as being guilt (making up for all the years he posed as a fraud) or revenge for his murdered family, I do not think it is that simple.  I think there is something more to him, something that he hasn't revealed yet, and Simon Baker does a magnificent job portraying this very interesting character.  I am looking forward to the second season.

PS:  As for the whole ""Mentalist"" versus ""Psych"" debate, I will say it is all a matter of taste.  I tried ""Psych"" and did not like because I found the lead character highly annoying--but that's just me.",1256601600,4,1003,4.315508021390374

Simon Baker is a very good actor who presents a cheerful, child-like character (he appeals to older women, I'm told) who is, nonetheless, intellectually sophisticated.  What a nice combination.  He is nowhere near as handsome as he is claimed to be but has a delightful charm based on a happy, smiley personality.

If you enjoy solving mysteries , clever plots that keep you guessing, this is the DVD for you!  Excellently scripted, with  funny one liners sprinkled amongst  thrilling investigations of Murder. Fascinating illusions and deductions which keep you hooked through to the end of every show. The shows are stand alone plots which are satisfying in themselves, but the depth of characterization is revelatory, the surface lightness of the Mentalist himself slowly shows signs of fragility and a painfully darker sub-plot is revealed by the end of the series. Simon Baker and rest of the cast are simply brilliant, giving the characters depth which leaves you wondering what next?",1256342400,2,707,5.294642857142857

The comedy is well placed and never takes away from the show or the situation.
And unlike many crime shows we know and love there is no romance between the consultant and detective.  There is a bit of wanna be romance on the team, but not the leads.

Having heard about it on tv ads, I decided to borrow Season One from the local DVD store and see for myself what this show was all about. It's a bit quirky, a bit black comedy, but alot of fun.  Simon Baker is perfect in the role of Patrick Jane, a pseudo-psychic who is always a few steps ahead of everyone else. His character is witty, intelligent, and a bit arrogant at times.

I will especially praise the packaging, as it looks excellent! It is truly a 'collectible' packaging, if compare with those cheap packaging but insane pricing dvds. Keep up the good packaging, i will definitely keep on buying for the season to come!",1255305600,2,589,4.556603773584905

Shown here in the UK on Five, it doesn't get great ratings (probably because it's then repeated about 6 times in the following week on various sister channels) but it is a nice respite from the violence and reality rubbish which seems to dominate UK television.

An ensemble cast make this a must watch, but Simon Baker is the stand out.  This part could do for his career what ER did for George Clooney.

Well written, well acted and all in all great telly.  I enjoy it very much.  Hope that Five continue to show it even though ratings are not fantastic.",1248566400,4,598,4.440366972477064

Christie and Conan Doyle can be blamed for the flawed genius crime fighter with that unique quality with Sherlock Holmes, Ms Marple and Poirot. There have been later takes on this theme such as Nero Wolfe. More recently its been Monk, Columbo, Mrs Fletcher (Murder She Wrote), Profiler and Medium.

This isn't serious crime investigation and thankfully its not meant to be. Enough with the real life police/hospital dramas that are usually quite frankly an overglorification of a generally unattractive, nasty and messy business (believe me I work in the crime area).

Shows like those beforementioned and of course The Mentalist are pure entertainment and totally detached from reality and that's why I like them. What makes these shows so successful is a quirky character with a unique special quality, an actor able to translate the role well to the screen and good stories and supporting characters. Simon Baker is perfect in his role, the support characters are good and the story lines entertaining.

Too often networks have lost the escapist theme in favour of an attempt (falsely) to achieve a more realistic approach. Fewer and fewer are the fun shows that I recall as a young man, such as Hawaiian Eye, 77 Sunset Strip, Wild Wild West, the Man From UNCLE, Avengers, The Saint, Outer Limits and the Twilight Zone. There have been some recent successes with Magnum P.I., Macgyver, The Pretender and X-Files. Great examples of pure escapism, realistic enough have you half way believing, but fun enough to know at the end of the program that you have had a good time.

The Mentalist is just such a show. Its the sort of program you want to watch over and over again because of the unusual nature of the character and the cleverness of the actor in portraying that character. Its the process and the interpersonal exchanges that are why you watch programs like this. The conclusion, though important, is secondary to the journey we take with the lead character seeing his quirky and genius approach to the information received.

Thank goodness there are still some programs like this around, like oases in a desert of modern day TV visual chewing gum, that has long ago lost its flavour.",1246233600,32,2390,5.25984251968504
3519548,5,B001CTDH76,"It is tough to produce something new and different in a TV police procedural, but ""The Mentalist"" succeeds in its highly entertaining first season.  Simon Baker (The Guardian) returns to TV as Patrick Jane, former wealthy (and fake) psychic who made the mistake of mocking a serial killer on television.  The serial killer, Red John, retaliated by slaughtering Jane's wife and young daughter.  Jane is now a consultant with the California Bureau of Investigation.

Jane assists a squad of detectives run by one Theresa Lisbon.  His contributions to investigations are his remarkable powers of observation and an almost disturbing ability to read people.  Balanced against these talents are a low threshold of boredom and a boyish charm that lets him get away with most of the pranks he plays on his squadmates and on the occasional suspect.

Robin Tunney does a nice job as the patient and highly professional Lisbon.  Not less often than once a show, she gets talked into bending procedure to enable Jane to solve a case.  Lisbon is properly wary of what she rightly identifies as Jane's achilles heel, his thirst for revenge on Red John.  She may have a certain cautious fondness for Patrick Jane as well.

The rest of the squad provides a nice ensemble feel to the episodes: Amanda Righetti as attractive, ambitious Grace Van Pelt; Tim Kang as the wonderfully deadpan Kimbro Cho; and hulky Owain Yeoman as Wayne Rigsby, who suffers through the season with a terrible crush on Grace.

Each episode features a new case, typically a murder with unusual circumstances to which Jane can apply his talents.  Each case has enough plot wrinkles to keep the viewer guessing along with the detectives.  The show succeeds as a drama while retaining a nice touch of humor through the interaction of the squad members.  The thread running through the season is Jane's hunt for clues to the identity and whereabouts of Red John, a search that will lead to a thrilling and disturbing season finale.

""The Mentalist: The Complete First Season"" is very highly recommended as a new and entertaining version of the standard police procedural.  ""The Mentalist"" has been renewed for a second season beginning in September 2009.",1245974400,10,2209,4.959239130434782
3519549,4,B001CTDH76,"Is The Mentalist a rip-off of PSYCH?  To those who believe it is, I am sorry, but there is little that these two series have in common.  PSYCH is a comedy with serious moments, but the Mentalist is a serious drama with moments of humor.  Both are great series.

The cast is excellent.  Let's focus on the supporting players-Tim Kang is a riot as Kimball Cho.  He is so dead serious.

His partner, Wayne Rigsby played by Owain Yeoman, is the comic relief, especially when plays off Tim Kang's Cho.  Of course, Rigsby has a mad crush on Grace Van Pelt played by the red headed beauty Amanda Righetti.  She seems too beautiful to be a cop, but she is as about as serious as Kimball Cho and is a good officer.

One comment, because of space limitation, has to be made about the Boss of the group-Virgil Minelli played by the wonderful Gregory Itzin.  He played President Charles Logan on 24 which gave the US presidency its first czar.  Let's hope he is more prominent in Season Two.

Of course, Simon Barker as Patrick Jane and Robin Tunney as Teresa Lisbon are a delight to watch.  The chemistry between them is electrifying.

Patrick Jane does have an air of sadness about him.  The menacing Red John serial killer is always in the shadows.

The season finale is one of the best written finales that I have seen.  The twists and turns in the finale is like a tango performed by two dancers who know how to shock and awe the watcher with such moves that are beyond technique-it is pure artistry.

It is a great freshman series.  Hope the writing can keep up for season two.",1244937600,18,1571,4.407665505226481

I place the series in higher regard for being truer to life (as TV goes), as one reviewer said, because they worked in the child welfare business for many years and this was pretty representative of the real thing.  The Mentalist doesn't have the character depth, making you think more about the person.  Here, Simon Baker was the best actor, Dabney Coleman next, and the others were a less strong, but the story and the two leads carry it.
