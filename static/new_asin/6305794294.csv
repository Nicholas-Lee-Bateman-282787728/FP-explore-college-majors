7894848,4,6305794294,"The movie stars Carter Wong , Polly Kuan and an assortment of others. A Ming General Kuan and his family are killed. The Generals son is saved though by a General Juan. The boy is then taken to the Shaolin temple by his grandmother for the purpose of being safe and learning kung fu in hopes of one day gaining revenge. The boy goes by the name Tang and is looked after by an older and tougher student played by Carter Wong. The boy and his friend (Carter Wong) eventually have to pass through the 18 Bronzemen so as to leave the temple. They eventually get out of the temple and pair up with the young mans intended wife played by Polly Kuan and go after the Ching leader who was responsible for the whole mess. I think their are movies with better kung fu, but not many as entertaining to watch. This truly is a classic in all ways. If you don't have this movie in your collection then your collection isn't whole and you should add it immediately.",1036108800,,950,4.283333333333333
7894849,4,6305794294,"As a rule, when a movie spawns several sequels and the box art on each video sequel is similar to the first film video box art, it stands to reason that the original was hugely popular.  Such is the case here.  This is the first of what were ultimately 4 ""18 Bronzemen"" films (Eighteen Bronzemen, Eighteen Bronzemen 2, Eighteen Bronzemen 3, Eighteen Bronzegirls).  This legendary classic stars Carter Wong in what may be his signature role.  Relatively simplistic, this movie introduces us to a labryinthe of bronzed expert challengers as the final test before completing Shaolin training.  The mythology of the bronzemen is explored on multiple levels, including the theft of 18 demonstrative and instructive small bronze statuettes in various poses, representing secret strikes.  The fighting is perhaps only slightly better than average, but the unique intruguing concept makes the movie worth watching and owning.  This movie is probably for classic lovers only.  I have seen all 4 installments of the Bronzemen.  Somewhat out of keeping with typical kung fu movie-making practices, the sequel, Eighteen Bronzemen 2, actually retains the star Carter Wong and the director, Joseph Kuo, in what appears to be a conscious legitimate bigger and better extension of the first film.  For these reasons, Bronzemen 2 is clearly the best of the lot, followed by Bronzemen 1, followed by Bronzemen 3, and much further down Eighteen Bronzegirls (a slightly campy ignorable Carter Wong-less spinoff).  Final rating Eighteen Bronzemen 1 --- 3.5.",990316800,,1536,5.254098360655738

Adding to his already impressive list of martial arts titles such as 36 deadly styles, 7  grandmasters, born invincible, just to name a few.  This movie tells the  story of a young boy saved from death, and delivered to the shaolin temple  for protection.  His family slaughterd by the ming dynasty.  The young man  played by roc tien grows up learning the deadliest arts of shaolin kung fu,  with the help of his older and more talented shaolin brother (Carter Wong).  The day comes when he feels he should leave the temple.  The only way out  though is through the chambers of the 18 bronzemen.  With the Help of  Carter Wong he may get out of that, but once out how can he hope to bring  down the Ming lord?",967334400,,769,4.471014492753623
