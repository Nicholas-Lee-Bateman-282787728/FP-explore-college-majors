8175122,5,B000N60H4U,A great introduction course for his more in depth RPM course.  Includes a bonus DVD which is nice.,1436400000,,98,4.444444444444445
8175123,4,B000N60H4U,"This package include a dvd of Tony and an introduction to his RPM life planning system, both done in a ""live"" format.  I believe that this will be most effective for those who own and have practiced the Time of your Life (TOYL) series that Tony put out a few years back.  It is supplementary material that helps solidify the concepts Tony details in the TOYL series.  Watching Robbins live is impactful as you are able to observe some of his core concepts (physiology, emotional impact) that are essential to his results system.  I highly suggest purchasing the TOYL 10 cd package and using this as a boost to cement the life changing practices.  Thats about $300 total for a system that can truly move you away from regrets and towards what you want out of your life.  That being said, this abbreviated version is not a bad idea if your a rookie, it's a great test run to determine if you accept the principles and would like to invest in the TOYL set.",1193356800,,953,4.448275862068965
8175124,2,B000N60H4U,"I am a big fan of Tony Robbins, but this DVD was only a small segment of the RPM system and is a little bit of a commercial.  I have heard the old version of this time management system and it is amazing.  If you have never heard Anthony Robbins before, this might be worth checking out.  It is just a small sample of his stuff.  Then, if you are convinced, invest in the full system.",1192579200,5,384,4.0131578947368425
