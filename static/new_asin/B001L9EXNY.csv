3682121,5,B001L9EXNY,"Take a journey back in time, when Cyclops ruled the land.  Roman citizens were not safe, herds were randomly decimated, and fear reined supreme...that is, until the great Caesar himself rid the land of the dangerous creatures!

Except for one.  The last Cyclops roams the forested area around Rome, dining on unsuspecting thieves and brigands.  A hungry trio spies a drying rack of wool, and pays for their dishonesty with their lives.  Cyclops rips through two men, leaving one behind to warn the Emperor Tiberius.  Corruption runs rampant through the Roman empire, and Tiberius, with his maniacal pattern of decision making and ambition, has run the gauntlet until his only the most violent `victory' games will do.  He sends Marcus Romulus to capture Cyclops for use in the games.  An enraged Cyclops kills many of the troops, yet Marcus emerges as a hero, inciting the jealousy of the Emperors' nephew.  Popularity is no weapon against blind ambition, and the victory games pit man against Cyclops, friend against friend, and ultimately, freedom against tyranny!
This is one amazing movie.  The CGI employed on Cyclops is remarkable, just as the costuming/props used on the Centurions is.  A picturesque digital reconstruction of Rome serves as a suitable backdrop for this freedom motivated film.  If there is any problem with the production, it is the Victory games pit used.  I am not sure that an Emperor as fanatical as Tiberius is depicted as would settle for a small arena, but it does work in the film very well.  Another realistic element is that of the format of the games with small side battles climaxing in a major brawl.  The background element of the slaves being used in the games instead of building the nephews' villa addition is also factual.  In times of war, households were cleaned out of slaves for war efforts and `freely' given when any Emperor demanded it.

The casting of Eric Roberts as Tiberius is excellent, while Kevin Stapleton as the imprisoned General is a good foil.  Roberts gives a performance that reminds me of the BBC I, Claudius strongly.  Stapleton is rugged, and is a fitting Roman centurion.

Roger Corman gives us a film that is a good addition to any sand and sandal collection.  Great DVD jacket too!

3682123,2,B001L9EXNY,"In CYCLOPS, director Declan O'Brien combines several film genres: the rise of the Roman Empire, the fall of the Roman Empire, the Cyclopean mythos transplanted from Homer, and the regeneration of a pseudo-Frankenstein.  It is to be noted that O'Brien fails miserably at each. The time is imperial Rome with Tiberius as emperor. If this Tiberius is the one who followed Augustus, then there would have been many alive who could still remember the mighty Julius Caesar and the imperial Augustus who followed him.  Eric Roberts plays Tiberius as a simpering lunatic who delighted in the gore of the arena.  I do not argue with O'Brien's decision to place the Cyclops at the dramatic center.  In fact, the animation reminded me of a slightly more hideous Shrek, and in this case, the Cyclops was the film's only round character.  All the others were paper mache one dimensional cutouts who were typecast as predators or victims.  What I found even remotely interesting was the morphing of the Cyclops from a brainless 10 foot brute to one who could learn a few words in English.  You will recall Mel Gibson from BRAVEHEART shouting ""Freedom"" as the ax fell.  The Cyclops here tries mightily to enunciate the same, but with some undoubted comical effect. CYCLOPS is not a film to learn something factual about Rome or Homer.  It is, however, one in which the unititiated may think that they have.",1230940800,3,1391,4.8354430379746836

3682130,3,B001L9EXNY,"All the grandeur of Rome..........on a budget of a buck fifty.  What a spectacle.  The CGI giant Cyclops was very shiny and new looking as he lumbered about the country side lopping off heads and eating the odd Roman who chanced to get in his way.  All too soon, the poor fellow is captured and treated miserably.  If he hadn't been the last of his kind, he could have unionized and revolted.  Instead, he becomes a plaything to the reigning despot Tiberius Caesar (Eric Roberts).  Forced to perform in the coliseum (not the big fancy one, mind you, but a teensy weensy version) battling desperate men chained together with but a sword and a shield to share amongst them.  Naturally, there is rampant corruption everywhere and a sick sycophant (Craig Archibald as Falco) constantly giving his crazy uncle Tiberius a few too many bad ideas.  Can the newly imprisoned hero Marcus (Kevin Stapleton) rally the troops and save Rome from the sadistic rule Emperor Tiberius!?  Or will he be content just to teach his new buddy Cyclops a few key words like ""meat"" and ""free"" (although I'm almost certain Cy understood the idea of ""free meat"" right from the  start when he learned that people taste just like lamb chops).

What a hoot.  Though I guess this movie wasn't meant to be a comedy, nonetheless I found it funny.  Eric Roberts didn't act so much as he smirked his way through the role.  And poor Kevin Stapleton simply looked bewildered and out of sorts in a skirt while Craig Archibald sneered appropriately as the villain of the piece.  No one looked too happy to appear in this one ring circus.  Not to put too fine a point on it, this film is a hack job.  Crap from the get-go.  Nuttier than a fruitcake.  Still, I couldn't help but muster a particular fondness for the mess they made.",1432598400,2,1789,4.586750788643533

3682139,2,B001L9EXNY,"After watching a series of awful Bulgarian shark movies (the latest being ""Shark Hunter"" featuring Velizar Binev who appears here as Cletus,) I changed it up a bit and decided to watch ""Cyclops"" (released in Hungary as ""A Kklopsz Szvetsge,"") a Bulgarian sword and sandals epic starring Eric Roberts as the evil and merciless Emperor Tiberius Caesar and a wretched CGI Cyclops. I smelled trouble as soon as I saw that it was produced by Roger and Julie Corman. I give it two stars for unintentional laughter-provoking moments, which are plentiful. For starters, Roberts chooses an interesting accent for Caesar, sounding more like a Chicago crime boss up against Eliot Ness than the Emperor of Rome.

The hero is Marcus (Kevin Stapleton, who is clearly the best actor present,) a military commander assigned to deal with the Cyclops menace; on the other side of the coin is conniving weasel Falco (Craig Archibald,) who, like Caesar, has a liking for pointless cruelty that does not further the plot. Amazingly, the Cyclops is captured and brought to Rome but (of course) breaks loose and goes bananas. The answer is to make the Cyclops fight in the arena against criminals. After maneuvering himself into a promotion over Marcus, Falco uses a crucifixion setting as a pretense to arrest Marcus, who promptly volunteers to be a gladiator and fight in the arena. Before it's done, there is a clash of women (Barbara, played by Frida Farrell) is the vixen-in-chief, while Flavia (Tania Kozhuharova) is a slave sympathizer, who fears that Marcus will start a popular uprising. Naturally, pathos ensues when it turns out that the Cyclops is actually a nice but misunderstood guy, and extremely protracted scenes of Cyclops education ensue. (This is actually much more boring than it sounds.)

The stab at a twist ending involves Marcus' former slave Gordian (Mike Straub) in an odd conspiracy which I won't spoil for you. There actually is one surprise near the end of the film, but you will not be shocked at who Falco engineers the headline battle to star. Most of the plotpoints are astonishingly predictable, and the finale is a real hoot if somewhat divergent from recorded history.

Flaws in the film are too numerous to mention. I have been inside the Colosseum in Rome, and it is impressively enormous; the same arena here reflects a venue with substantially more budgetary constraints. The plot is ridiculous (not that you could have possibly been expecting much,) and the dialogue is frequently excruciating (""I'm gonna' see what Marcus has under his blanket! A Cyclops, perhaps?"") and the effects are among the worst I have ever seen. The extras are limited to English subtitles. This is a very poor film, but if you want some bad movie guffaws, this one is loaded with them.",1327708800,2,2781,4.938034188034188
3682140,3,B001L9EXNY,when we needed you? What a stupid looking computer cyclops. Why does every movie today have to use computers for special effects? Computer effects have their place but only if they look real. The acting in the movie was also bad. The only real character I liked was the one Frida Farrell played (Barbara) and the only real reason I liked her was she looks good as a gladiator and has nice looking thighs. All that said: The plot is these roman soldiers capture a cyclops. He is put into a arena and that is all I'm going to say. For all the bad I just said for some reason however I liked it but if you want to see a better cyclops movie watch the 7th Voyage Of Sinbad.,1324080000,,669,4.153846153846154

3682142,3,B001L9EXNY,"Like so many Syfy movies, Cyclops is about exactly what it says on the tin: a Cyclops.  But that's an oversimplification, because this movie (produced by Roger Corman, of all people) actually has something to offer.

Oh, it's a rip off of every period movie that's gone before, of course.  A little bit of Gladiator here: a similar mask and a military man turned gladiator who seeks to upend the status quo. A little bit of Cyclops there: the Cyclops' appearance is inspired by Ray Harryhausen's amazing stop-motion Cyclops in The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad. What's a Cyclops, a Greek beast, doing up in Roman times?  Well, let's just say that my expectations are low enough that I was relieved that the movie didn't take place in a modern day high school.

The titular creature shows up immediately and begins hacking off limbs.  It looks primitive by modern CG standards, but that's okay - it seems like a stop-motion beast brought to life.  It interacts frequently with Roman soldiers and other assorted idiots, who capture the Cyclops and then can't seem to keep it safely caged. The centurion who captures it, Marcus (Kevin Stapleton), gets a little too greedy in asking for a land grant when he delivers the beast to Emperor Tiberius Caesar (Eric Roberts). The Emperor doesn't take kindly to Marcus' sass and decides to strip him of the title, a slippery slope that ends with Marcus as a gladiatorial slave.

In the background, poor actors read from lame scripts.  Meanwhile, no Roman legionnaire is capable of spearing the half-naked Cyclops, the beast seems to change size depending on the perspective, and a prostitute becomes a killing machine in the arena. But we came to see the Cyclops in action and this movie doesn't disappoint.

Indeed, the Cyclops is almost an action hero of sorts.  He uses everything from spears to chains to decimate the opposition, biting, ripping, and tearing foes limb from limb with gleeful abandon. The Cyclops even gets a bit of pathos in the arena in the fashion of a true antihero.

This isn't a good movie, but it doesn't pretend to be.  It's a movie about a big one-eyed giant.  And in that regard it's a success. The Cyclops has a particularly narrow focus, but it's very good at what it does: eating lots and lots of Romans. What more could you ask for from a monster movie?",1278806400,,2321,4.712871287128713
3682143,3,B001L9EXNY,"Eric Roberts plays the Roman ruler that can be benevolent in a sociopath sort of way. A group is sent out to capture a cyclops that just wants to be left alone but when they get to close to his home he decides to have them for snacks. Okay this is kind of funny, gross, and reasonably done fantasy/gladiator movie. If you like the low budget films on the SciFi channel you will probably not be adverse to spending a couple hours watching it. Just put the brain on pause and bring popcorn.

3682144,1,B001L9EXNY,"The fantasy genre has made some great movies. Tops among them were the films of Ray Harryhausen, the legendary stop motion animation director who found a way to make us believe everything from giant octopuses to flying harpies to skeletons carrying shields and swords. He introduced us to Jason and the Argonauts and took us on many voyages with Sinbad. Unfortunately there have been some who have taken his joy of the fantasy genre and turned it into crass film making that offers nothing to rejoice in.

I'm beginning to think that the SyFy channel is more detrimental to the genre than it is helpful. Sure, they make a good show like the STARGATE series or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. But when it comes to made for TV movies, SyFy turns out some of the worst drek possible. I swear, if I have to glimpse a preview for another snake movie I might go mad!

Using CGI effects for almost all of these films, they seem to misunderstand how to use it. Rather than take the painstaking time to make the items in CGI seem real, they rush it into production and toss out an inferior product that, with any luck, only the least jaded 10 year old will find a reason to enjoy. For those of us who grew up with Harryhausen or who loved the Rings trilogy, the movies SyFy is churning out leave much to be desired.

That being said lets take a look at CYCLOPS. I have fond memories of the Cyclops due to THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD made by Harryhausen (thus the connection to this film and reason I mentioned him earlier). Perhaps the best thing that can be said about this movie is that after watching it, you'll want to go back and watch those old films.

The movie takes place in ancient Rome where Emperor Tiberius (Eric Roberts) rules. The games in the coliseum are not what they once were and new entertainment is sought. The emperor is in luck when a Cyclops is discovered roaming the countryside, recently killing several travelers who attempted to rob him.

Tiberius sends out his most successful solider, General Romulus (Kevin Stapleton) to capture the beast at the request of his right hand man, a man who has more motive to hope for Romulus' failure than his success. Of course Romulus does capture the beast and take him back. Now the Cyclops can compete in the arena for all to see.

Rather than hail the conquering hero, Romulus demands satisfactory payment for his capture of the Cyclops, but word from the politician to the ears of Tiberius not only prevents this but also stops his being hailed as a hero as well. Further conniving results in Romulus being stripped of his rank and tossed into the gladiator pit to fight the monster.

While imprisoned, Romulus gets a glimpse as to the real personality of the beast. He is no more monster than man, simply tortured by all he meets and hungry. The pair become at least friendly and you realize early on that should they face off against one another they'll choose friendship over a fight to the death.

The big day arrives and after several battles the beast is released. So what happens? I won't spoil it for those who love cheesy fantasy films or low budget CGI happenings. But it is fairly predictable.

To try and calculate where this movie goes wrong is impossible. The sets are terrible, most notoriously the arena where the battles take place. Whereas most movies of this genre show huge arenas (even the low budget sword and sandal films of the 60s had huge arenas) I've seen small town football stadiums that are bigger than this one.

The acting? Is that what you would call this? Roberts has the ability to act, but here he seems content to increase his bank account and opting to take the money and run rather than perform. If you thought Kevin Costner's accent in ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES was bad, try out Roberts New York accent via ancient Rome. And Stapleton (who I guess stars on TV's ONE LIFE TO LIVE) should stick to soaps. He not only can't act, he has no star presence here at all. He looks completely out of place.

The Cyclops itself isn't too bad looking, just poorly rendered in CGI. The shadows rarely match properly, the quality of the set image when placed against the CGI is way off and in general the whole of the effects fails miserably.

If you rent this movie from say a Redbox for a dollar, find a way to get your money back. It is truly a bad movie and not even in the so bad its good category. And if SyFy continues to make movies like this, my guess is the ratings will decrease rapidly.",1271376000,4,4475,4.484029484029484
3682145,2,B001L9EXNY,"This is really more of a historical movie than anything.  Like a low-rent episode of Rome with a CGI monster.  At least I assume a computer was involved in the creation of the monster,  But it's so poorly done it might have just been done freehand.  They must have been shooting in Norway or something.  You can see the actors breath and it gets distracting.  But I enjoyed Eric Roberts as Tiberius even if my fellow reviewers did not.  I easily watched it all the through and I might watch it again sometimes.  Ordinarily I would give a movie like this 3 stars.  But read on....

About the Blu-Ray itself...  OK it is 1080p and it looks rather good in general.  And it has a decent 5.1 soundtrack.  But it has nothing else.  No extras.  No sub-titles.  No trailers. No popup menu.  No top level menu.  It just plays the movie.  This is not what I expect with a Blu-Ray.  If no trailer is available for this film then how about a few trailers for other films?  And give us some menus.  A bare-bones blu-ray production like this greatly reduces the chances for a 2nd viewing anytime soon.  This is why I dinged it down to only 2 stars.

3682152,4,B001L9EXNY,"Who doesn't love a good cyclops movie?  I sure can't think of anybody, nor would I consider someone a true American if they didn't.  Cyclopses(Sorry, I have never had to pluralize the word ""cyclops"" before) tend to only make fleeting appearances in a limited number of films, but thanks to Roger Corman's company, New Horizons, we get a whole film dedicated to a cyclops!  And dig this, it actually takes place in ancient Rome!  Throw Eric Roberts into the mix and it's a no brainer that you'll have to watch it.
In the film, a cyclops is posing a threat to Rome, so Tiberius Caesar(Roberts) orders it's capture.  Hero soldier, Marcus, succeeds in capturing the ten foot beast, only to be thanked by having his promotion yanked out from under him and being accused of treason.  Tiberius puts the cyclops into the gladiatorial games to compete with slaves and criminals who fight to earn their freedom or death.  The cyclops is a vicious brute who rips people limb from limb, decapitates and devours them as well.  He even bites off a kid's hand(he was asking for it though.  You don't tease a cyclops)!  As you might have already guessed, our hero Marcus will eventually be pitted against the cyclops, but Marcus learns that befriending a cyclops can be quite useful, especially if you're planning a rebellion.
This film was fun nonsense.  Not historically accurate by any means, but why should it be?  Roberts kinda sleepwalks through the evil emperor role, but that really doesn't bring the film down.  Considering we're not dealing with a Schmuckheimer budgeted film here, I was actually quite impressed with the look of the film.  The movie looks higher budgeted than it probably was and the set design wasn't bad at all.  No, it wasn't HBO's Rome, but pretty good I must say.  The cyclops itself is naturally a CGI creation, and an above average one for a straight to video film.  He's not all that impressive looking to me, but I hate CGI anyway.  You get used to his look before too long though.  The cyclops becomes a bit more of a sympathetic character in the last act of the film.  I think it's supposed to be emotional, but it's more comically amusing than anything.
Like I said, it's a fun little film and I'd recommend it to lovers of B films, horror films....and movies about gladiators!!
I wouldn't put much stock in folks who say this film is bad, has bad acting, writing, FX, etc.  IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT A CYCLOPS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!",1236470400,14,2449,4.635730858468677
3682153,1,B001L9EXNY,"I bought ""Cyclops"" on a whim at a local Wal-Mart after seeing it on sale for $9.99.  Turns out that there's a very good reason this thing was on sale for $9.99. It stinks. Not just a little, but a LOT. It was so bad that I literally couldn't watch any more than the first 30 minutes of it. After that, I took the disc out of my DVD player, but it back in the case, and then threw them both in the trash.

Where do I start?  The ""acting"" was absolutely putrid. I wouldn't question you at all if you told me that the casting director for this turd of a movie went down one afternoon and picked people off the street for the starring roles. The screenplay itself was written by a 5th grader. The directing was horrible, as were the camera angles. Finally, the computer-generated special effects that generated the ""Cyclops"" himself weren't even remotely believable. All in all, this thing looks like it was made in about a week's time with a budget of about $200,000.

The California state legislature should pass a law banning Roger Corman from ever directing another motion picture again. As for Eric Roberts, it's sad to see that someone who's had a decent acting career has now been reduced to this. Seriously, Eric ... If you can't find anything better than this for work, maybe it's time to find a new career.

8317610,5,B001L9EXNY,"Decent little B-movie for creature feature lovers that, unfortunately, once again features a rather lame SyFy CGI monster.  Unlike many other SyFy flicks, though, this one actually tries to keep a straight face throughout, and even succeeds on occasion. Also, unlike most other SyFy flicks, it's a period piece and, though its budgetary constraints are obvious, does come across as more colorful than much of their other offerings.  Eric Roberts is actually pretty effective as a Roman Emperor, obviously PURPOSEFULLY playing Tiberius as foppish.  No, he doesn't get too deep into the character simply because the script gives him nothing to chew on, nor is that the kind of film this is.  I enjoyed his presence nevertheless.  Kevin Stapleton is surprisingly sympathetic as the main protagonist.  Plot is, though made up of gladiator movie conventions, pretty decent.  Historical accuracy, um, OK, ""Roger Corman"", ""made for SyFy"", enough said?  However, it actually isn't any less accurate than movies like Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" or ""The Centurion"".  BTW, for those who think the arena in this movie looks too small, the famed Colosseum would not be built for at least another 50 years after the timeline of this movie.

8317614,2,B001L9EXNY,"Eric Roberts is not a poor actor, and usually instills a tongue-in-cheek kind of aura to the films he is in, but the poor man can't overcome the horrible acting of just about every person in this film.  It's hilariously horrible! Honestly....how can an actor be so bad that a scream sounds 'faked'.

I wasn't sure if the producers had intended for the breath of most of the actors to be showing in great plumes due to how cold it must have been where they filmed, or if it was just something that happened.  Not sure if the city of Rome became so cold for frost?  ;)

They tried with the special effects - but honestly that Cyclops is just pasted onto the screen and is so comical.",1461801600,,681,4.2890625

8317616,3,B001L9EXNY,"I purchased 'Cyclops' on sale and I'm glad I did. It's not a terrible picture. It's just not worth more than a budget movie. I watched it once and doubt I will watch it again.

The movie itself is about a Cyclops that has survived the purge of previous emperors and is probably the last one left in the world. It is captured and used mainly for gladiatorial games. It is tormented and starved and put in a cage. The main star of the movie follows a path similar to the one of Russell Crowe's character in 'Gladiator'. He feels sympathy for the Cyclops and is eventually thrown into the gladiatorial contests through scheming of the emperor and his underling.

It looks like a decent amount of money was spent on the sets and the costumes and the acting is not bad. What hurts 'Cyclops' the most is the CGI. CGI is used for the Cyclops and it looks amateurish or like something from a low budget movie a decade earlier. So you will have to use your imagination and suspend disbelief a bit if you want to enjoy this movie.

I give it three stars based on average plot above average sets for a low budget movie and knock it down a star for poor CGI.
Recommended strictly for fans of low budget monster movies.",1457481600,,1206,4.327433628318584
8317617,3,B001L9EXNY,"I'm still trying to work out what the Cormans were trying to achieve with their production of 'Cyclops'. It's a budget production but they seemed to want to make it look like something much bigger. But so many of the scenes feel small and enclosed even though there seems to be reasonable detail in set design and costuming. Rooms are small, the arena is small and the supporting cast is small. They try to make up for these deficiencies by using sound, so, for example, you see about two dozen people standing around but there is a crowd of thousands cheering in the background. And whenever Cyclops is around there is a constant loud (but distorted) thumping. It also seems to be miscast, largely and there is a wide variety of accents in play. The story is reasonably coherent but some of the acting is terrible and some OK. The Blu-ray video presentation is quite good most of the time, making use of some decent CGI for the city landscapes, lots of bright colours and also the Cyclops doesn't come off too badly much of the time. The audio suffers from being a Dolby Digital 5.1 track only - no lossless option. Although the dialogue and music are fine the constant thumping of the Cyclops moving about is a bit of a mess. In the end it's a bit of fun but nothing special or something that you will remember next week.",1451952000,,1323,4.471074380165289
