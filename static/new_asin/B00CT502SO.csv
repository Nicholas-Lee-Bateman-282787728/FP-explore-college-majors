5738582,4,B00CT502SO,My kids love Gumball and they were very excited by our purchase of this movie!  Arrived just in time for our trip!,1379030400,,114,4.181818181818182
5738583,4,B00CT502SO,"It's time to go Gumball crazy in the amazing world where the kookiest cornucopia of characters can be found in the city of Elmore.  The latest volume of this ""Amazing World"" show contains 12 new-to-DVD episodes such as:

""The Party"" - There's a party going on tonight, but Gumball and his bro Darwin need to find dates to take with them.
""The Kiss"" - A kiss from his Granny Jojo leaves Gumball emotionally scarred for life.
""The Secret"" - Darwin is hiding something from Gumball, and Gumball won't rest until he finds out what it is !
""The Poltergeist"" - Something is haunting the Wattersons' attic.  Turns out to be their neighbor Mr. Gaylord Robinson who's not his usual grouchy self lately.
""The Date"" - Gumball finally asks Penny, the peanut girl with moose antlers of his dreams out on a date, but it doesn't turns out the way he expected it.
""The Ghost"" - Gumball asks the ghostly Carrie to possess him so that he can learn to say ""No."" to his situations.
""The Prank"" - Darwin and Gumball constantly pull tricks on their father, but at what cost ?
""The Robot"" - The robotic Bobert wants to be ""a real boy"", so he decides to impersonate Gumball and steal his life.

Another character gallery dominates the bonus features like the previous volumes.

So get your groove going with the latest installment of ""The Amazing World of Gumball"" on DVD.  And of course, there are new episodes premiering weekly on the Cartoon Network, too !",1377648000,,1435,4.5859375
5738584,5,B00CT502SO,"Although I do not like how CN released Gumball in three mini section DVDs; I love this specific title because it includes ""The Debt"" which features Mr. Robinson's debut of ""I Want To Be Free.""

The first time I saw Mr. Robinson rip out of a conservative suit and into bright leg warmers and neon tights I laughed so hard I cried. I could not stop laughing as Robinson flailed all over the stage and the fireworks shot off. The ""adult humor"" really comes full circle as to why his first name is Gaylord (it's not just because it's an old name.)

Also the look on his wife's face (Margret) going from shock to complete disgust and then just walking off is priceless.

If you need a really good laugh, this DVD is worth picking up for this specific episode alone.

5738598,5,B00CT502SO,"This animated series is the definition of zany wacky cartoons. Sometimes, you'll get a callback or reference to a previous episode, which adds some continuity to this world, but they're mostly random hilarious shorts. This was made to be like a best-of dvd, but it's been confirmed that all of Season 1 can be owned by collecting these three Amazing World of Gumball dvds: The DVD, The Mystery, and The Party.",1423612800,2,409,4.774647887323944

5738603,5,B00CT502SO,"The original season of Gumball is genius level humor. I love all the quirks and humor for both children and adults. A+ stuff.

This DVD is basically just barebones; there is no HD version available, and no extra content to get into with the discs. Its just Gumball, plain and simple. I'd like HD, but the type of graphics this cartoon is drawn in scale up well with interpolation on players.",1414108800,,391,4.507042253521127

5738607,5,B00CT502SO,Dvd's are standard DVD's and packaging is typical for a box set. I can say i really hate the commercials for their other DVD's at the beginning of this one and all the others...,1397433600,,177,4.235294117647059

5738609,5,B00CT502SO,My 3 year old loves Gumball. We DVR all the episodes but would have to start a new one every 15 to 30 minutes. And he would get upset at the distraction. Now he can enjoy it straight through without interruption.,1389657600,,212,4.195121951219512
