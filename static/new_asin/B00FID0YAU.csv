5993263,5,B00FID0YAU,"This is a very fun workout, and is a tough one to get through. If you do this workout correctly, then you will begin sweating within five minutes. The music is great, it is very upbeat, and I would highly recommend.",1394841600,,215,4.2682926829268295
5993264,5,B00FID0YAU,I love boxing workouts.  I believe it's one of the best for full body conditioning and was delighted when I found one by Cathe Friedrich.  I have been a long-time fan of her workouts and this one doesn't disappoint.,1393804800,3,215,4.487179487179487
5993265,5,B00FID0YAU,Great workout!  I love that I can break it into shorter workouts or do one long workout.  It's always nice to get another heavy bag workout.,1393286400,4,140,4.346153846153846
5993266,5,B00FID0YAU,"What can I say?  Cathe is the best workout teacher.  The combos in this workout are lot of fun.  Good cardio and great music.  My husband workout in a gym 4 days a week.  The other day, I invited him to workout with me with this DVD and he said Cathe kicked his butt.  You get a lot for your money.  Enjoy!",1392422400,,306,3.838709677419355
5993267,5,B00FID0YAU,I love this DVD!  It is a great workout and so much fun.  Cathe is great and it really gets you sweating.,1389398400,,105,3.727272727272727
5993268,4,B00FID0YAU,"Not the most difficult of workouts, but definitely a good one.  Point of reference: I'm an Insanity and GSP Rushfit ""graduate"" (few times).  I like the different segments in this video (with weighted gloves, without, etc).  I agree with the other reviewer that my heart rate doesn't go way up with this, but using the weighted gloves does give my arms, shoulders, and back a great workout and that's equally important.  Great for days when I don't want the high intensity of something like Rushfit but still want a good 60 minute workout that works my muscles and isn't just cardio.",1388188800,5,582,4.732673267326732
5993269,5,B00FID0YAU,"This workout is a kickbox cardio workout from Cathe.  Punching and kicking drills with and without boxing gloves are part of this workout.  There is even a heavy bag bonus section.

The chapters:

-Warm up
-Kickbox Cardio
- Cardio with Gloves
-Kickbox Combos
-Stretch
-Heavy Bag Bonus.

There are several premixes that are shorter and longer than the original workout time of 55:16.  The premix times range from 36 to 65 minutes.

I really enjoyed this workout here's why:

* The movements were perfectly synched to the music.  I normally don't like Cathe's choice in music since I need a driving beat to get me through a workout.  The music really fit this workout.

* The music choices:  normal, instrumentals with Cathe, just Cathe.  So if you don't like the music or the tunes annoy you, you can use your own music.

* The combinations made me think. They weren't overly complex, but they were more than the usual, ""jab, cross, hook, upper"" that is in so many kickbox workouts.

* Cathe is her usual peppy and encouraging self.

I didn't find this workout all that intense.  My heart rate wasn't elevated and I used weighted gloves for the entire workout.  Cathe uses 12 ounce boxing gloves for just one section, Cardio with Gloves.  This section had me breathing hard, but before you know it, it's over.  Of course, I am coming off of a Beachbody's Insanity workout, so any cardio compared to that feels easy.

I will use this workout on those days that I want a cardio workout, but not wanting anything too intense.  I don't have a heavy bag, nor do I plan to get one (I just don't have the room in my workout space.)  I still do the heavy bag section and I try to punch really hard so that my heart rate gets elevated.

I would recommend this workout to those wanting a fun cardio kickbox workout that's not too, too intense and that makes you think.",1380758400,3,1857,4.5075075075075075

5993271,5,B00FID0YAU,Love this workout!,1449964800,,18,5.333333333333333
5993272,5,B00FID0YAU,"I love it!  The music is the best music I've ever heard on a exercise dvd (I graduated 1985).  There's 5 sections: warm up, cardio, with gloves which I would call more of a weight session, combos (not as much cardio), then yoga to cool down.  When I first did the 2nd section, I didn't think I'd make it through the tape, but that is the hardest cardio.  I'm definitely getting more of her dvds.  This is my first one by Cathe.",1449100800,2,427,4.158536585365853
5993273,5,B00FID0YAU,this is a great dvd if I was to say one bad thing about this dvd is the bag work isn't long enough but a great dvd never the less.,1448409600,,130,3.3666666666666667
5993274,5,B00FID0YAU,"Great work out.  A little hard to keep up with at first but after you learn the routine, it is a lot easier.",1437782400,,108,3.6956521739130435
5993275,4,B00FID0YAU,I always enjoy Cathe's workouts.  She challenges me.,1431820800,,52,5.5
5993276,5,B00FID0YAU,I love this workout.  Physically challenging but easy to follow.  One of my favorites.,1424131200,,86,5.071428571428571
5993277,4,B00FID0YAU,"A really good workout, pretty intense but personally not my favorite Cathe workout",1420761600,,82,5.384615384615385
5993278,5,B00FID0YAU,"5 stars! this will get you out of a plateau, or if you need to get in shape and burn fat, this will get you there. If I don't sweat, I don't feel like I'm getting a good workout. This workout made me sweat like heck on the first try! Now it's one of my favorites. The moves are very empowering and I love when she's motivates you by saying ""get angry""...lol! I get pumped!",1405641600,5,372,3.973333333333333
5993279,5,B00FID0YAU,"Unusual for Cathe, the music is fantastic, very motivating. This is a great way to get your stress beat!

The workout consists of warm-up, cardio kickbox, boxing drills with big gloves and then combos.

Warm-up, cardio kickbox, boxing drills  = 30 min
Combos = 20? (I haven't done them all yet)

It is good, because if you only have 30 min you can get a kick-butt workout, or if you have more time you can add the combos.

The combos take some coordination and time to learn, but this is good because it keeps you interested.

Great, great workout",1400112000,,547,4.474747474747475
5993280,4,B00FID0YAU,Great workout even the warm up is a breather. There is some jumping involved so be prepared. Good music which gives a motivated beat just when need. Cathe's videos are great.,1399248000,,174,4.645161290322581
8615917,5,B00FID0YAU,"Love this cardio workout, its fun and burns calories! My Fitbit registers over 5000 steps after completing two sections of this DVD. If you enjoy kickboxing this is the DVD for you.",1530144000,,181,4.6875
8615918,5,B00FID0YAU,"Ive been doing kickboxing for over 10 years, and I love that I can add this DVD to my collection! It has a great combination of punches and kicks. You definitely sweat too. I can see how some of the combinations might be a tad confusing at first. If you're a beginner, this may be a little more challenging but not impossible.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys kickboxing!",1514764800,,394,4.472222222222222
8615919,5,B00FID0YAU,"I have many videos from Cathe. Her workouts are tough but very good. This one is no exception. It is great. Although they use boxing gloves in part of the workout, I use weighted gloves. You'll get a good workout with or without gloves.",1499644800,,236,4.386363636363637

8615921,2,B00FID0YAU,Didn't care for this video. The music to me is irritating and it's not really kickboxing. There's too much jumping also. I really did not like the bonus bag section. It was pretty boring.,1489363200,,187,4.529411764705882
8615922,5,B00FID0YAU,Have really enjoyed this dvd.  It kept me in shape over a long Connecticut winter.  It's great to be able to mix and match the workouts to fit my needs.  Sometimes there's time for a long session and sometimes there's not.,1485475200,,222,4.365853658536586
8615923,4,B00FID0YAU,Does a good job of giving you a good cardio workout.,1474329600,,52,3.8181818181818183
8615924,5,B00FID0YAU,"I LOVE this workout!  I've only done it once (I skipped the gloved portion) but had so much fun that I couldn't wait to write a review.  I was hesitant to buy the DVD after being disappointed with ICE ""Rock'm Sock'm.""  I felt the ICE workout was pretty advanced with more cardio drills than kickboxing and I hated the music, which too me has to be motivating.  ""Rockout Knockout"" doesn't have the cardio blasts and sticks to pure kickboxing; you can make it more difficult if you add weighted gloves and do the pylo moves but it's also easy to modify for those who can't tolerate high impact (my knees can't take it anymore so I loved that you could tailor the routine to suit your needs).  Then there's the music!  What a difference music can make - the songs were recognizable and perfectly coordinated to what move you are doing.  This may not be Cathe's most rigorous video but for people who aren't fond of cardio (I prefer weight lifting) this workout is so enjoyable you'll forget that you're exercising and dripping with sweat.  I will be using this DVD regularly.  Highly recommend!",1473379200,,1091,4.582474226804123
8615925,5,B00FID0YAU,"This is a WORK OUT.  I thought it would be more ""easy""... NOT.  But just good enough.  Hit my stride and target heart rate within 7 minutes of the WARM UP.  But, very gentle on the knees.  I'm over 40 and my doctors have prescribed for hard core cardio but less jumping (it's hard on the knees).  This combines strength and stress relief!",1472169600,4,338,4.285714285714286
8615926,4,B00FID0YAU,A great workout video from beginning to end. Been using it for two weeks and have lost about 5 pounds. The video has a segment on a punching bag which is great but just wish it had more routines.,1464048000,,195,4.0256410256410255
