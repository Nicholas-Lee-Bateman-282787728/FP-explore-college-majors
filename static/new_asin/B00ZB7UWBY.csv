Eva Vencl",1520985600,,41,5.0
8719722,4,B00ZB7UWBY,"This box set contains four operas in their original DVD cases, housed in a thin cardboard box. All operas are available on Amazon individually.

THE OPERAS ARE:

TOSCA:  4.4 stars
Paolo Carignani  conducts the Orchestra of the Opernhaus Zrich. The singing and acting are excellent. The modern scenery and costumes generally support the story although the minimal scenery at the end is not helpful.

CARMEN:  2.5 stars
Franz Welser-Mst conducts the Orchestra of the Opernhaus Zrich. Whoever assembled this box set did no favors to Jonas Kaufmann by including this production. The excellent singing is betrayed by bad, low-budget directing. The scenery and props are often inadequate or inappropriate. Kaufmann's acting is awful. I blame the director, not Kaufmann, who plays Don Jos as a gibbering half-wit who later turns into an anger machine. Vesselina Kasorova delivers a powerful vocal Carmen but lacks the usual sensuality, and can barely dance. Isabel Rey as Michala gets her dress torn off by the soldiers and runs around that way for a while.

FAUST:  4.3 stars
Yannick Nzet-Sguin conducts the Metropolitan Orchestra. Both the singing and acting are excellent. The scenery and costumes support the director's atomic bomb scientist theme. Sadly, the opera gains nothing from this theme.

WERTHER:  4.7 stars
Michel Plasson conducts the Orchestre de l'Opra national de Paris. Excellent all around. Occasionally we watch from offstage as singers enter or exit, which distracts from the story.

8719724,4,B00ZB7UWBY,"These are good recordings of interesting interpretations. I miss a little the eye and ear catching moments that i am looking for, for this 5*s.",1475712000,,143,4.76

8719726,2,B00ZB7UWBY,One of the discs has stereo sound error - singers are on the right of the stage coming thru left speaker channel and singers on the left hand side of the stage coming thru the left speaker. For me this makes it unwatchable. Others seem not have even noticed it..,1459987200,,262,4.26
8719727,5,B00ZB7UWBY,"I ordered this 4 - pack even though I have 2 of the 4 already, sung  by a different tenor.
SUGGESTION:
WHY DON""T YOU OFFER CUSTOMERS THE OPTION OF CHOOSING "" ANY"" 4 OPERA DVDS  FOR A"" BULK  PRICE"",  JUST LIKE THE ONE I RECEIVED. THAT WAY I WOULD ORDER 4 THAT I DON'T ALREADY HAVE.
Thank you for your consideration.

This Kaufman Carmen, Tosca, Faust and Werther was very enjoyable.",1458691200,3,381,4.309859154929577
