I feel so much more balanced, healthy and calm with a consistent yoga practice so I am constantly looking for ways to stay inspired and motivated to practice at home. For me it is very challenging to complete a full practice at home so i prefer to go to classes BUT the time restrictions of making it to classes doesnt work well with my busy inconsistent schedule- instead it makes it near impossible to schedule in a yoga studio class. Determined to find some at home teaching - Dashama's you tube videos became a must for me! She is an inspirational person in so many ways! Having trained with her you tube TV channel and regularly with this DVD (more than a dozen times) it has allowed me to stay more consistent and practice yoga whenever I need it! She has a very clear and conscious way of explaining the adjustments needed in each pose and challenges me to explore further depths within the practice. Her visible dedication and innate talent for yoga teaching is a blessing... I've been daydreaming of making it to her upcoming Bali Retreat but in the meantime I will be staying tuned for her next 30 day yoga challenge and perfecting the sequence from this video.",1302998400,,1223,4.538461538461538

8360585,5,B002AZ8OH4,"I tried for years to find a great yoga video so I could work on my flexibiliy and have less stress without having to add the stress of going to a studio and paying over $20 a class each time I needed a moment for myself. Most of the videos were boring or I the teacher would get on my nerves. This video was simple, easy to follow, beautiful and I found it easy improve my flexibility. I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to do yoga without all the hassles of the studio and people looking at you. I am going to recommend it to my friend who just had a baby and can't leave the house for workouts because she is on a ""feeding"" schedule at home. GREAT VIDEO!! Thanks!",1254700800,3,679,4.074626865671642
