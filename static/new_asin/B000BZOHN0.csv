8094919,5,B000BZOHN0,"I got this workout from my parents years ago(i.e. early 1990's) as a Christmas gift.  I found that this video improved my balance, control over my own body, and my seat/position.  Not many items are needed to complete this workout: a chair, a soccer or basket ball to squeeze between your knees, a hand/tennis ball, and a little bit of time.  This workout helped keep my muscles in riding shape when I had to ""give up"" riding for college.  The intro is by Denny Emerson, and the videos sprinkled throughout the tape really break up the routine.  Each exercise is clearly explained, and with a little diligence this video can help any stage of rider improve themselves.",1289520000,,668,4.6752136752136755
