8438666,3,B004R2HPOG,"The wicked princess Suryalekha (Amrita Singh) falls in love with the one man who is able to defeat her champions.  This man, Suryavanshi Vikram Singh (Salman Khan) deceives her, then leaves her in disgrace.  Incensed, she kills herself and her ghostly self torments the area as she waits for Suryavanshi to be reborn and return to her.

Hundreds of years later, an archaeologist uncovers part of Suryalekha's palace.  His team, including his daughter Sonia (Sheeba) and son-in-law Vicky (Salman Khan), visit the palace grounds.  Suryalekha's spirit is convinced that Vicky is Suryavanshi reincarnated and calls to him.  It is left to Sonia to overcome the evil with her love and protect her husband.

This is, at times, a silly movie, and sometimes overly dramatic.  That said, it's still an enjoyable tale, full of action, romance, the supernatural, and music.  There is much more to the plot that can be explained in a brief synopsis, and the romance was a good story.  Singh was fantastic as the beautiful and evil Suryalekha, and Sheeba's portrayal of the opposing pure and lovely Sonia was equally good.  Both of Khan's characters were less than three-dimensional, but still appealing.  The most unfortunate aspect of the entire movie was the light brown hair/beard of Suryavanshi, which looked simply goofy on Khan.  The music and choreography were good, as were the costumes for these numbers.  Overall, while bordering on the ridiculous in parts, it was an entertaining movie and a good example of the Bollywood of the 1990s.",1502841600,,1533,5.055776892430279
8438667,4,B004R2HPOG,"A good horror film for the early 90's.
It was very different and unique for its time. It's not classified as a horror film but as a romantic thriller. However, I still found it scary as a kid. This is definitely one of Salman's better films during that era. If you like supernatural mysteries. The film has everything; comedy, action, suspense, horror, mystery, fantasy and off course, singing and dancing",1304380800,2,405,4.8
