8183047,1,B000O5B40Q,"This DVD is misleading. By the packaging you're lead to believe that you are purchasing a DVD that is both bilingual and educational. The contrary. It is a DVD of the primary colors. However, it doesn't contain a voice-over or any type of dialog what so ever. How is a baby (0-2 years old) supposed to learn anything from this. Instead, each color is introduced through a title page. Last I checked, my baby couldn't read. For example, the word, ""Azul"", is displayed. Then, 5 random blue (azul) objects float around on a black background to a classical song. It does this until the entire song is over. Honestly, I got a a little dizzy watching this. Then, it moves on to the next color, etc. It's not visually exciting either. The shapes displayed are low quality renderings. They look like the computer animations I created in my intro-digital art class in college. My baby was so bored! I can't believe this product is out on the market.",1216684800,3,940,4.601190476190476
