8372394,5,B002L5LHOK,"I can only comment on the first season of this Japanese medical drama series. I've only just started the second season, and the third season is waiting. I'm not a fan of Japanese movies with very few exceptions so I wasn't expecting much when I started watching this, and I found one of the characters to be extremely offputting in the first couple of episodes, but as it went on and more characters were introduced and developed and various subplots were deftly interwoven I began to recognize that this is an exceptional program. The episodes are very suspenseful, and the viewer is continually being surprised. I wonder at the effect such a series would have on the Japanese public to see their medical culture portrayed in this way with all the political machinations taking place behind the scenes and the indifference to the patients on the part of some hospital administrators and doctors. This is the backdrop and counterpoint to the other part of the story which portrays heroic and skilfull practitioners of medicine doing their best to save lives in spite of those conditions. Strongly recommended.",1360281600,,1109,4.935828877005347
