8230858,5,B000Y2JCJO,"A moving portrayal of how dictatorship tears apart families. While the facts of Argentina's brutal dictatorship (backed by the U.S.) is kept in the background, it's something Americans need to understand better: how the government of the United States contributed not only to the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands across Latin America, but also left so many bereft of children or parents.",1508803200,,398,5.234375

This film is an outstandingly understated film showing what feelings run through people (run through a family of people) when placed under severe stress.  While the stress applied to the family in this film is political upheaval, the viewer does not have to necessarily know all the ins-and-outs of the unfortunate burdens that stemmed from the takeover in the late 70's.  The viewer simply needs to know that something unpleasant was happening, and the details focused on and examined here within the film are those that revolve around human relationships.  It makes a compelling emotional statement about who we are as humanity by way of showing a number of clever metaphors.  Some might find the film ""sentimental""; however, I found it to be best described as tender, compassionate, and extremely sensitive to the love that resides behind familial relationships.  This film is about family. This film illuminates the universal truth that we must cherish the good moments we may have when we have them.  But at the same time, its somber approach still leaves us with the recognition, too, that we need to work for and hope for a better future whenever possible, considering consequences of our political foibles.  The film has outstanding acting by the entire cast.  The visual imagery is slick yet simple.  If you hate tender tales, you may hate the story portrayed in this film.  If you like tenderness, with a dance with metaphors and subtle approaches to family relationships, then you'll love this film and the many scenes within.  Five Stars by me!  NOTE:  It is virtually impossible to find this film to buy at a reasonable cost and with English subtitles AND on a medium that is compatible with devices common to N. American devices.  Working on that!",1453334400,,1773,4.945945945945946
8230861,4,B000Y2JCJO,A very touching film.  The Argentine dictatorship and its consequences for a family as seen from a child's view. Ricardo Darin and Cecilia Roth do a great job as the caring parents.  Watch with a pack of Kleenex on hand,1288569600,,219,4.45
