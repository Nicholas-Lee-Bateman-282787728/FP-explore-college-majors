7835570,5,6303056709,"I spent the 1970's in Brazil, scouring the Rainforest for a cure for cancer. Ten years after that I found myself in Africa, hunting only the most dangerous of animals. Lions, tigers, rhinoceroses, tyrannosaurs rexs, humans...But in 1989, I ended up with a bad case of typhoid fever, and was told the best treatment for my case was to move to a colder climate and get some rest. Rest is for the poor. Ever seen a poor man relax? It's like watching a log rot on the floor of the forest. ""Rest? Not for this man,"" I told the doctor. ""I'll rest when I'm dead or paralyzed from a fall off the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro!""

So after I finished my dress-down of Doctor Sleepy McCrybaby Face, I was off into the night, onto my next adventure...

Next stop, Switzerland!

After enjoying several weeks being pampered in a ski lodge, dipping caviar covered bald eagle eggs into melted Swiss Chocolate, I became bored, and through a local shopkeeper, learned about the Swiss Rail. At first, I was skeptical. After all, I am a man of vast experiences - I had once speared a Zimbabwean medicine man through the heart after spending three weeks tracking him through tall grass infested with tarantulas and scorpions the size of rottweilers. I once flew a hang glider from Nepal to Mongolia, and used Genghis Khan's femur as a skewer for elephant steaks. Having been around the world and back again, I asked the man, ""How could a man such as myself, with a rich history, be transfixed by a railroad?""

He said, ""I can't explain it, kind sir. But the ride is simply majestic.""

I decided to take the man's word and try the Swiss Rail. And guess what? The strange man was right. Life was never the same for me. All the diamonds and rubies and karate lessons from Bruce Lee's ghost and elephant tusk tooth brushes in the world will never, ever replace those six days I spent touring the Alps on the Swiss Rail. Majestic it was, friends.

So, when it came time to relive my experiences on the Swiss Rails, I chose this VHS tape set. It may come with a hefty price tag, but when you're as rich as me, reliving the moments that altered the very course of human history is, well, priceless. Besides, the poor don't ride these trains, they are relegated to the coal car and forced to eat old rubber tires. Again I say, what lazy swine!",1306886400,2,2310,4.462085308056872

The whole series should be on PBS at least once a month and I guarantee you'll raise some serious money with these awesome panoramic video's of Switzerland and the surrouding areas . Unfortunately ""NO ONE"" has made these available on cd and could make a fortune just re-formating these on CD to sell on the PBS stations . Watch just one and you'll know what I mean . IT will take your breath away . The Best travel videos I have ever seen as far as scenic area's go . ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ! Sincerly, Pat Simmons",1221955200,,575,4.383177570093458
