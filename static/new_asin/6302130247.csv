This tape completed my long sought after set of SIX Bulls championship tapes. Thank You Amazon for providing a venue where I could find a 23 year old tape.",1400544000,,427,4.219512195121951
7821463,5,6302130247,"This is a awesome video documenting the Chicago Bulls's rise to the becoming the team of the 90s. This is this first championship and without a doubt one of their greatest teams ever. One of my favorite parts was Jordan and Bulls getting redemption by defeating The Pistons who eliminated the Bulls the three previous playoff series. The Pistons used to overwhelm the Bulls with their physical style of ball but it showed how great a team the Bulls were to mature and have mental toughness. The video has interviews from all the players and it's interesting to hear their thoughts on the championship season. Of course the best part of video is when they chronicle the Lakers vs Bulls Finals. Although it was a 5 game series it was a hard fought series with the featured match up  Air Jordan vs The Magic Man. It was fitting Jordan's first title would come against Magic. It was a sort of passing of the torch. I recommend this to Bulls fan, Jordan fans and fans of the NBA. Cheers.",1368057600,,982,4.51685393258427
