8047850,5,B0007KX4D8,I have the other four vhs in this set. Had to purchase each one vol at a time as there wasn't a complete set available. This one completes my set. Five in all each covering a different technique. This is a good video on glass engraving giving useful tips on finishing ones engraving. The only thing better would be if this set were on a dvd.,1392422400,,341,4.181818181818182
