7751530,4,B01FR35ZQS,"The film stayed fairly close to the book, and the acting was top notch. I appreciated the way they changed the ending to allow Gilly to stay in contact with Mrs. Trotter, W.E., and Mr. Randolph.

For Gilly Hopkins fans, you won't be disappointed.",1475884800,,246,4.590909090909091

7751538,5,B01FR35ZQS,"Everything Katherine Paterson writes moves me.  All of the actors in this film were superb and well-cast.  Mrs. Paterson herself makes a cameo appearance.  I might have missed her, except I went to high school with her son David (who wrote the screen play for this movie, based on her book by the same name).  I've just ordered her new book ""My Brigadista Year"" and can't wait to read it.",1512691200,4,388,4.5

7751540,5,B01FR35ZQS,"As someone that came from a very messed up childhood I often avoid movies like this but it's so full of love.  It's got it's tense moments of course but many laughs and many tears and come on now... how can you pass up a movie starring greats like Kathy Bates, Glenn Close, Octavia Spencer and Bill Cobbs along with these brilliant child actors.  It was absolutely perfect in it's telling.  Highly recommend!  My only upset was coming here to Amazon and hoping to find this on Blu-Ray..... *sigh* and this movie is recent.  Of course all the action movies get the high end Blu-Ray treatment but not nice heartwarming movies like this.... really a shame, truly!",1509494400,,660,4.6068376068376065

7751558,5,B01FR35ZQS,The movie was fantastic. It was a very good movie I think for preteen age are teenagers.

7751575,5,B01FR35ZQS,"Fans of the classic 1978 children's book by Katherine Paterson will be happy to know this movie adaptation remains satisfactorily on par with the original story. Gilly Hopkins (Sophie Nelisse) has been bounced from foster home to foster home for as long as she can recall, and she's become angry and mistrusting because of it. All she really has is a photograph of her mother Courtney, which she often speaks aloud to while alone in her bedroom. Gilly is sure that if only she could track down her mother and let her know how badly she wants them to be together, Courtney will be glad to whisk her off to her own home.

Meanwhile, Gilly's latest foster placement is with Maime Trotter (Kathy Bates). While Gilly is determined not to allow herself to settle in, Trotter is equally determined to be a good parent and give Gilly the love she needs.

With the help of her new teacher Miss Harris (Octavia Spencer), Trotter's blind elderly neighbor Mr. Randolph (Bill Cobbs) and her little foster brother W.E. (Zachary Hernandez), Gilly slowly begins to realize that many people want to care about her...if only she'll let them.

Nelisse does a fantastic job of portraying the complex Gilly, often coming off as rude and unkind when there's a vulnerable girl wanting desperately to be loved just underneath.",1491264000,,1302,4.803571428571429

7751578,5,B01FR35ZQS,"This is a faithful adaptation of the Katherine Paterson classic, with an A-List cast! Foster kid Gilly has been a challenge for previous placements, but she finds a home, a family, acceptance...finally, in a place where love welcomes her in. Still, she yearns for (and dreams about) a reunion with her birth mother. Pathos and gentle humor, compassion and understanding come into focus as Gilly's suitcase is packed yet again. After a very limited run on a few theater screens, the film went right to DVD and ""on demand,"" but that's not a reflection of its quality as a story or as a film. Some independent features (without explosions and zombies) find a niche on home screens, with thoughtful conversations following. This is one of those, and I highly recommend it for families.",1487203200,9,781,4.879699248120301
7751579,5,B01FR35ZQS,"An adaptation which is faithful to the book.  All of the actors are a joy to watch (except Julia Stiles because her character is such a B****!) and the story is worthwhile family fare.  Have your 4th or 5th grader read Katherine Paterson's novel, then watch the film together as a family.  Well done.",1486857600,2,300,4.518518518518518

Defensive and toughened by a rough childhood, Gilly Hopkins ends up on the front doorstep of a foster mom (played by Kathy Bates) who is not to be denied. Determined to love Gilly no matter what, this foster mom sets about to break down the barriers to Gilly's heart. A great cast, a moving tale of adolescence, and the importance of family make THE GREAT GILLY HOPKINS a film to be added to home video collections.
