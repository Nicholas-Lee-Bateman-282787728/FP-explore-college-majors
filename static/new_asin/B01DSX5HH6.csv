8756834,5,B01DSX5HH6,One of my favorite Shark Week seasons! Loved the Megalodon special and also Submarine's. I think it's cool to mix a little fun and historical lore into educational programs. This was a great mix of specials so of course the whole set is a must-have for any SW fan.,1501804800,,264,4.408163265306122
