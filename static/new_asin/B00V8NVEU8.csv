8709612,1,B00V8NVEU8,"I felt betrayed by this movie. Three-fourths of the way in it turned into a god-botherer movie. This kid works hard to solve all the problems in his life, wakes up his father, and then is expected to give the credit for his hard work to god. Extreme waste of time.",1524873600,,264,4.196078431372549

8709614,3,B00V8NVEU8,"Good story and would be easy to watch if not for the constant annoying music and even singing over almost all of the dialog and every single scene of anyone doing anything. I hope the people who made this movie learn from that; knock off the annoying music. What was the point? Just to make me skip ahead constantly? I have never been so annoyed by a movie, but it was such a good story I wanted to see the end. Why, WHY,  would you put singing, singing that is louder than the dialog, over the dialog? Absolutely the stupidest decision in movie making history.",1522713600,3,561,4.3428571428571425

8709617,5,B00V8NVEU8,"Once you start playing the movie, you may notice that the sound quality, and the video production quality is not so amazing. But if you keep watching, you will really be drawn in, because while the acting is not outstanding, it is very good for each and every character. The story goes along, and really is interesting. All of the actors are Australian.  The message is clear and sometimes subtle, but you will really get it. It can also be a very powerful movie at times, I was really suprised by this movie. Very well-made. The Christian message is here. Good acting. You will enjoy it. NOTE: There is a bible study included. (You could use this movie for your youth group!)",1459209600,2,676,4.540983606557377

8709619,5,B00V8NVEU8,"When I became saw the movie case of 1500 Steps, the first thing I saw was ""Life Is a Race"" on the cover with a young man posed to start a race. on the cover and I was really looking forward to learning more about this Christian running movie.  I wondered how the title, 1500 Steps, related to the story since I knew that the average person takes 1,500 steps in one mile. What I learned was that 1500 Steps is a powerful drama about surrendering to God and embracing His will in our lives.

The story takes place in the beautiful, Sydney, Australian beach suburb of Cronulla, and it takes us through the journey of the life of 16-year old Jonas ""Jobe"" O'Brien (Alex Fechine). After the death of his mother, Jobe faces considerable odds both at home with his alcoholic father and at his new school. Jobe's father verbally abuses him while he continues to get drunk regularly and is suffering from his own pain.

The more Jobe learns about himself, in 1500 Steps, Jobe learns more about his athletic abilities and his potential to become a runner. He learns how he has inherited his mother's athletic ability and the fact that his mother was once a champion runner. Throughout 1500 Steps, we see Jobe become friends with the group of kids that aren't necessarily in the stereotypical popular group at the same time he is excelling with running.

There's one of those bully-types - Damon (Jack Matthews) - who is clearly threatened by Jobe's presence both on the track and with Damon's girlfriend, Grace.  Grace (Laura Benson) sees Jobes worth and starts spending time with him at about the same time that Jobe beats Damon on the track in school running competitions, which results in her former boyfriend becoming angry and retaliatory. As Grace seems attracted to Jobe, Damon begins to threaten Jobe's reputation, his track career, and even his faith.

When Damon puts a drug in a students drink at a high school dance, the result is tragic and Jobe loses a good friend. After this tragic event, Jobe seeks revenge against Damon, as an emotion and power wells within him that he has never experienced before. At the same time, Jobe is accused of using drugs and is suspended from the running team even though he is innocent.

A retired ex-Olympian, Harry White, sets about mentoring his athletic ability when - by chance - he happens to see Jobe run. It is now up to Harry White to encourage Jobe to dig deep and decide what type of man he wants to become.

As a drummer in the praise team at my church, I want to say that the song, Blue Sky, by Melissa Otto is awesome and the words are very meaningful. The only negative thing I could find about this movie is the fact that the background music made me crazy, although that's probably just me. The movie, 1500 Steps really inspires and shows that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and if one stumbles during the race it is important to remember that finishing well is the key to ultimate triumph.  This movie speaks to the heartache of alcohol and drug abuse and shows that people too often place a period in their lives when God has instead placed a comma, allowing more of the story to follow.",1436745600,5,3145,4.532627865961199
