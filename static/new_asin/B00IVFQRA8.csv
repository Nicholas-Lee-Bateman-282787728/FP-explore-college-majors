8645657,1,B00IVFQRA8,Bummed. Waited a few weeks and when received it from Mexican address was not compatible with our DVD player. Feeling stupid for spending $28 on a DVD in the first place!,1496620800,,169,4.483870967741935
8645658,5,B00IVFQRA8,"This movie made me reevaluate how I view/rate all other movies.  What I mean is that if a story is told, it should be told more to be true to the subject than it should be told to entertain the viewer.  This makes it a higher form of art, more credible and more powerful.  La Jaula de Oro does a great job of capturing the struggle.  The struggle for the dream.",1452729600,2,361,4.042253521126761
8645659,5,B00IVFQRA8,"This tells the story of three teenage friends from Guatemala - Juan, Sara and Samuel. They want to have a better life and so set off together for the hazardous trip to the promised and fabled land of the USA. Along the way they also pick up an Indian in the shape of Chauk, who can not speak Spanish but Tzotzil.

The film depicts the train journeys and all of the travails that befall them and to say this can be heart breaking is an understatement. It is based on actual testimonies of immigrants who have lived to tell the tale. They have to deal with corrupt officialdom. Pimps and drug gangs as well as the underhandedness of those who you would have expected to help.

This is from Diego Quemada-Dez who is more famed in Hollywood for his work on `Gone in sixty seconds', `The Constant Gardener' and '21 Gramm's' as a camera man. Here he directs and co writes and because he knows his way around a camera he has managed to capture some beautiful shots, which clearly juxtapose against what the kids are going through on the screen. In Spanish and English and the aforementioned Tzotzil with good sub titles, this is a film that really moved me and I can absolutely recommend.",1422748800,7,1181,4.462962962962963
8645660,5,B00IVFQRA8,"Translated to English, the title of this movie is ""The Golden Dream"".
I ordered my copy from the U.K. and although it will not play on my television here in the USA it will play in my computer.
This movie was exceptional, far beyond what I had expected.  I can no longer ride the fence when it comes to treating our brethren from south of the border like the human beings they are.  The USA has been blessed over and over and it is morally wrong for us as a nation to turn our backs on our neighbors who are less fortunate.  The people that come here from south of our border are desperate for a life without poverty and political corruption.  I stumbled upon this movie by accident while looking for something else.  It has won numerous awards overseas but here in the USA it's practically unheard of.  Worth watching, worth sharing..",1421539200,5,835,4.42483660130719
8645661,5,B00IVFQRA8,"Already sympathetic to the plight of Central American immigrants, still I'm left with a much greater appreciation for what privilege I have, and a sense of responsibility for using for good;  For those who are ideologically pitted against migrants from the South, I'm sure God knows what you're thinking.  My grandparents really weren't much ahead of the stories depicted, only the laws and prevailing attitudes at the time were not so dehumanized as we've become.",1402358400,7,464,5.173333333333333
