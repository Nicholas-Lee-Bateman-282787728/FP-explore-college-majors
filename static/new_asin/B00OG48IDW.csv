6735711,5,B00OG48IDW,"Lovely in some parts , hard to watch in other parts but always a thought provoking movie. How does one bring ancient customs and old tribal laws into the current century? What happens when they conflict? That what's this story is about. In some parts of the world, a woman can be hunted down...stalked raped and made to marry the man who chooses her. The so-called woman can be as young as 10 or 12, while the man might  be over 25 as in this case. I won't tell you how the movie ends but I will say, I enjoyed it a great deal",1458345600,5,526,4.0576923076923075

6735716,4,B00OG48IDW,"This Ethiopian film, benefitting from support by producer and womens rights campaigner Angelina Jolie, is a pleasant surprise.  I had no expectations going in, not being familiar with the story, but finished it surprised, educated, and feeling exposed in a genuinely non Hollywood way to another culture and its values.
This true story of a young teenage girl abducted in order to be married in rural Ethiopia in 1996 has a real hook in its two main actors, Meron Getnet and Tazita Hegere, working as a story thanks to a non sensationalist matter of fact way it is told.
This is not focussed on Hiruts abduction and rape, but rather on the fact she fought back, and this resulted in her lawyer taking her side and fighting back against the system.. its about women taking back their rights and place in society, but done in a non preachy way.  The story appears to have been condensed somewhat, with some moments of the drama veering towards unlikely coincidence, such as arriving back to her house just in time to see the police reclaim their prisoner but too late to do anything about it.  On the other hand, moments which could have been sensationalised  Hiruts visit to her village ending in villagers shooting at their car as they leave, are glossed over and cut quickly away to the human and legal drama instead.  In truth, some of those cuts are slightly unsuccessful, leaving the viewer to put two and two together with the aid of a hurried line of exposition.  But this is a quibble when the milieu and characters are presented in such a genuine way as to help you stay in the movie despite some stumbles in the flow of the script.  And while the editing results in some jarring moments, the cinematography has enough handheld work to add drama where it is appropriate, but static enough when the characters need to breath.  Considering the location work and likely budget, its really not bad.. the occasional wide shots of Ethiopia are quite revealing, with green and farmland replacing my rather unfounded view of it as dry and dusty.  While the rural traditions leading to the event are condemned, the culture as a whole is not, with the meeting of the tribal elders showing their own brand of wisdom in how they deal with situations internally.
In the end, it is the empathy between the young Hirut and her lawyer that are compelling, and the message that ultimately, no-one is above the law.  It is the little stories and events that can rise to become society changing, when someone is willing to seize the moment and take a stand.",1445644800,11,2546,4.662946428571429

8683430,5,B00OG48IDW,"This is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone! I just introduced it to a group of university students in southern Japan as a way to explore the complex web of issues surrounding education and empowerment for women and girls around the world. Difret is a study in courage. The courage of a14-year-old girl who accidentally (?) killed the man who abducted and raised her on the way home from school one day. The courage of the young lawyer, Meaza, who fought tirelessly for her life and freedom in Ethiopia's legal system. Even the courage of her family, who risked their own lives to meet their daughter and sister and to defend her in the traditional tribal court of men, which actually spared her life. This film will make you think long and hard about the price a young girl has to pay to avoid child marriage, a crime inflicted upon 14,000,000 girls around the world. Watch it with your teenage students or children and see what they think about protecting the universal right to an education.",1478390400,2,1002,4.603351955307263
8683431,5,B00OG48IDW,I cannot believe I never knew this movie! It will tug  at your heart  throughout and cause a few tears!  Excellent  acting by far and really teaches us the true perils that exist in Ethiopia. Please view!!!!!,1469318400,,208,4.54054054054054
8683432,5,B00OG48IDW,What an amazing  story  I hope  this  movie  open a lot of  people who are still  believe on  this tradition. Well  done!,1468540800,,121,4.136363636363637
8683433,5,B00OG48IDW,"I found the movie ""Difret"" to be a triumph for women's rights while at the same time a sad indictment of a male dominated society married to a cultural tradition as hurtful and scarring as slavery.  To hear grown men justify the abduction, beating and rape of a 14 year old girl under the premise of love & tradition made me as a loving father wanna take up arms against these men; and I'm a God-fearing believer in nonviolence.

The movie is so touching and real that any human being with just a smidgen of love in their heart will be moved by the story and performance of the actors.  Us men must stand up against violence toward women especially if its an accepted tradition.  If a 14 year old girl, scared for her life can find the courage to stand and fight back against the odds, then all men must find courage to do right by women and defend their right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  We as men are no better than the worst of men among us. And we're as guilty as the man perpetrating the crime, if we stay silent, stand down or withhold our support of a woman's right to exist as equals among men.

We're not gods fellas, we're men. Hopefully, family men. Time to bury the many myths and traditions that once upon a time made us feel godly, and start being the family men our women can love and cherish without fear of us sacrificing them to our macho egos and ancient ideas of what a man should be. And that is what this movie made me feel.  Anger, compassion, hope.",1468368000,,1488,4.274021352313167

8683437,5,B00OG48IDW,"As a Muslim Bangladeshi woman once told me in reference to a recent ""National Geographic Magazine"" story The Changing Face of Saudi Women, Our problem is that men should learn to keep it in their pants! The solution according to male tradition has been in placing the onus on the victim which is just another element in support of female enslavement, and as shown in the film, ""Difret"", the story of a kidnapped girl, Hirut. The male history of what it means to be a female is one of: maintain the household; provide sex on demand; provide male heirs (w/female infanticide not uncommon). Let's remind ourselves of the list of almost warfare style tactics for male dominion over females: Asset control, role guilt, child marriages, domestic violence, FGM, acid attacks, kidnapping as shown in this film, foot binding once common in China, isolation/exclusion, and stoning. One would think that the moral compass of religion would provide a safety net for women, but all the major religions were created for an illiterate populace where strength governed the ethos. In Muslim cultures Sharia law is overseen by males. In Judaism the patriarchs write the rules which saw women as jealous, vain, lazy and gluttonous; likely to gossip and receptive to the occult/witchcraft. Christianity with special emphasis given to Catholic, Orthodox, LDS religions simply exorcised the word ""galit"".
So what is to be done? Hirut had the answer. Education! Educating girls would have a singular impact toward maintaining the health of the family, and by extension the community. A few critical locals promoting female education will have far ranging regional influence, for example, Afghanistan.",1458950400,2,1677,5.191881918819188
