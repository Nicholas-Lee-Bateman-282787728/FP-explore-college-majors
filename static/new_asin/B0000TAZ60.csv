8002465,5,B0000TAZ60,Two awesome classic sci-fi movies in one package.  What's not to like?  Both are entertaining for their genuine campiness and overall feel.,1394150400,,139,5.2727272727272725
8002466,2,B0000TAZ60,"In the Mountain Greenery, Where God Paints the Scenery, a few unlikely people converge. The future of our galaxy depends on what they do. One of them (Shirley Kilpatrick) is out of this world. She seems to want to get you and your little dog too. Could her actions be misinterpreted? Watch and find out.

This film has a lot of time filler and can be fast forwarded during the scenes where everyone is creeping around outside in the bushes at night with a searchlight on them and cheap music in the background.

I saw this on DVD but it looks like a poor transfer. The only DVD extra is the trailer.",1378771200,,599,4.339285714285714
8002467,5,B0000TAZ60,"1. She Demons (1958). Featuring an island of babes being held captive and cruelly experimented upon by an evil Nazi scientist. His horrific experiments involve their temporary uglification - what a tragedy! At one stage they make a daring escape, but are recaptured when they decide to do an interpretative dance (complete with jungle drums) right near the entrance to the Nazi hideout. Worth buying for that scene alone.

2. The Astounding She Monster (1958). Not as good as She Demons, as there isn't any expressive dancing. Silly gangsters-hold-good-guys-hostage-in-remote-hideout movie with the highlight being a mysterious alien woman in a shiny silver skintight suit whose perilously torpedo-like chest places them all in great jeopardy. She glows brightly in the dark and moves very slowly, but somehow manages to keep catching them by surprise.

Both movies feature the classic ""there's a monster about, let's all separate and wander around in the dark alone"" plot device.

All in all, great value for two very cool movies that would be excellent to have playing at a Tiki party or similar.",1111881600,19,1098,5.192090395480226
