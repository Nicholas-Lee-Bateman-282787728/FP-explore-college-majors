1731734,2,B000069CFD,"This is the worst of the BBC ""chronicles of Narnia""
trilogy. While the story of Prince Caspian is worth
almost 4 stars, the dawn treader story is boring and
done poorly. I understand that this film is 13 years
old, made for TV and for children, but the scene with
the dragon is so badly done. I would have liked the BBC
to elaborate more on ""prince caspian"", but I understand
they had to inlcude the ""dawn treader"" because we are
introduced to one of the main characters from ""the silver chair"".

I liked ""the lion witch and the wardrobe"" and ""the silver chair"", but they will cost almost the same seperatly as the complete triology boxed set. I think older fans(13+) should
skip this film, but younger fans(12 and younger) may like it.",1044057600,,736,4.492537313432836
1731735,5,B000069CFD,"I really enjoyed this televsion series when I was a young kid.  The music is really inspiring, the puppets of the Lion (Aslan) and the dragon are very realistic.  It doesn't have the modern 3D animation like today.  But I feel the orignal film tricks and the realistic animals really made this classic C.S. Lewis's story come alive.

The DVD is in excellent condition and it is closed captioned which has made this hard of hearing person very happy!",1219449600,2,449,4.6455696202531644
1731736,5,B000069CFD,"Prince Caspian:

Peter, Lucy, Susan, and Edmund are once again whisked into the land of Narnia when they least expect it: while in a subway together several years after ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" Narnia has been conquered by a plotting king, and the ""old Narnians"" are now scattered in hiding from the wicked humans. The children must aid Prince Caspian, the exiled rightful owner of Narnia, and win their kingdom back for the good of all.

This is an epic tale with many new and fascinating creatures introduced, with a central theme of faith. The fact that Lucy is the only one able to see the glimpses of Aslan when the struggle becomes bitter speaks volumes about the virtue of faith, and we can already see in this installment how Susan began to lose hers. The children are not only called to Narnia to save it once again, but to teach the new Prince the value of the old and magical ways of Narnia, and to learn a spiritual lesson themselves.

Voyage of the Dawn Treader:

The fifth book in the series finds Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace joining Prince caspian on a ship called The Dawn Treader, which is setting sail to little known Narnian territories where Caspians uncles have been exiled. Each island explores a different sin by which an uncle fell, and a different magical encounter for the voyagers to face and resolve.

The developement of the mighty mouse Reepicheep is an especially welcome treat for children, and the scene in which Eustace becomes a dragon and embodies his own foul heart, so gaining a sort of enlightenment and a definite change of character, is a particularly skillful use of symbolism.

The reaching of Aslan's kingdom is also a symbol of enlightenment, with the Kingdom of Aslan invoking the Kingdom of Heaven in the reader's mind. The islands can be seen as steps in the path to heaven, and the character developement along the way can be seen as an outline to the steps towards righteousness and spirituality. As a fantasy or as a religious writing, this is a hugely important book!

1731737,3,B000069CFD,"In the December, C.S. Lewis's ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" will follow in the footsteps of Lewis' pal Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"" with a gleaming new big-screen adaptation, full of top-notch CGI, costumes and settings.

In the months before it's released, however, it might be time to dust off the 1990 BBC adaptations of ""Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" crammed into one long movie. The first half suffers from the hokey production of the first film, but the second half blossoms into a fantastical sea voyage.

It's been months since the Pevensies went to Narnia through the wardrobe, and now they waiting for a grim summer vacation. But they don't know what changes have gone on in Narnia. Young Prince Caspian has been raised by his cold uncle King Miraz (Robert Lang) ever since his father's death, with only an old nurse and an aged part-dwarf professor as his friends.

But when Miraz's queen has a baby son, Caspian finds himself on the run, and is taken in by the ""Creatures in Hiding,"" talking beasts and magical people. But that isn't enough to ensure victory. Caspian blows the Horn of Queen Susan, and the Pevensies are whisked back into Narnia to assist the young Prince and his ragtag army in reclaiming his throne.

No sooner have Lucy and Edmund gone to their ""awful cousin Eustace""'s house, than a painting on the wall draws them in -- and deposits all three kids beside a giant Narnian ship. Caspian, now a young man, takes them on board and explains that he's on a mission to find some loyal lords who Miraz exiled from Narnia.

But the voyage only gets more dangerous, with the group being captured by slavers, consumed with greed over ""gold water,"" taken captive by invisible creatures, attacked by sea serpents, and Eustace is even turned into a dragon when he greedily claims a treasure trove. But the greatest threat is ahead: the very edge of the world.

It's a tricky thing to take two books and mash them together into one big movie, and it's a credit to the BBC that these stories aren't completely unwatchable. In fact, they unfold at a quick but steady pace, paying plenty of attention to the individual characters. The first half has several flaws, but the second half makes up for that in drama and severity.

This is less fantastical and more battle-oriented than the first movie of this series, especially given Peter's rather flat duel with Miraz right before war breaks out. But the filmmakers take time out to dwell on the minor characters like the sailors, Reepicheep the warrior mouse, and the lovably skeptical dwarf Trumpkin. You gotta love someone called ""Big Mick.""

Unfortunately, the movies do suffer from some decidedly hokey special effects; dragon-Eustace shifts size and looks absurd, and Miraz's army is clad in Ye Olde Dungeone and Dragone Armoure, complete with black bat motif. Very ""Batman goes to the Renaissance Faire."" The special effects are redeemed somewhat with a dazzling Dawn Treader, creepy Sea Serpent, and a centaur that still looks better than ""Harry Potter's.""

Barbara Kellerman still cackles and squeals, and Sophie Wilcox still whines all the time. But the two Caspian actors do an excellent job with their roles, both as a young naive boy and as an experienced king. David Thwaites is the breakout role here, taking Eustace from a whiny brat who gets under everyone's skin to a mature young man who thinks of others first.

Two stories in one -- the first rather flat, the second graced with some genuine chills and heartwarming moments. ""Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" has some serious flaws, but it's definitely worth watching.",1129420800,13,3664,4.829346092503987
1731738,5,B000069CFD,"I think the narnia chronicles are great,thelion,thewitch etc was a great PartI of the narnia series. my whole family loves the narnia movies ,although when we watched PartII, princecaspian & the voyage of the dawn treader,i didn't exactly see eye to eye with the special effects. PrinceCaspian wasn't exactly, what i thought it should be. the voyage of the dawn treader is simply superior to prince caspian & wonderful special effects. If anything, prince caspian should be remade, while the dawn treader should stay. then my second favorite,the Silver Chair, is PartIII and was one of the two best movies , in the chronicles of narnia.the time people get to this narnian ending, they will usually be curious to see if it makes up the holes in the series. So i highly recommend that you see firstly the wardrobe one, then skip prince caspian and go on to the voyage of the dawn treader so you'll be able to understand PartIII, the silver chair.",1078012800,,944,4.762195121951219

I loved reading all the books in the series.  I am hoping that someone will make a wonderful movie series out of the Chronicles of Narnia.  I am hoping someone that has as much passion as the man who is now putting out the Lord of the Rings movie series, will take an interest in CS Lewis.

7965456,4,B000069CFD,"-This review pertains to the original DVD release, not the remastered edition-

In 1989, the BBC produced the second and third films in their four-film series adapted from the books&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/0060598247/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>&nbsp;by C.S. Lewis. For the most part, these films serve as faithful representations of the classic children's stories despite their miniscule budgets. The films lack the elaborate special effects of later fantasy films, but this is a very minor complaint. The series, which first aired in America as part of the WonderWorks television program on PBS, has become a fondly remembered family favorite.

Prince Caspian
One year has passed for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy since their adventures in Narnia. While waiting for their train to arrive at the station, the four children begin to feel strangely, as though they were being beckoned to some other world. They find that they've been magically transported back to Narnia and in their absence a thousand years has passed in Narnia. Their castle lay in ruins and all those that they knew are long gone. The children come across their old Narnian possessions and then journey out into the vast forests, hoping to discover the reason for their being summoned. As they pass the river, they rescue a curmudgeonly dwarf named Trumpkin, from being drowned by villainous soldiers. Trumpkin explains that young Prince Caspian has summoned them to help him reclaim his throne from his wicked uncle, King Miraz, who killed Caspian's father and usurped his throne. Trumpkin leads the children to the hiding place of Prince Caspian and the small army of creatures that remain loyal to the young prince. The Children and the Narnians prepare for battle and arrange a duel between Peter and Miraz, and to the victor goes the throne. With the help of many creatures and talking beasts, including the brave and noble mouse Reepicheep, the Narnians defeat King Miraz and restore Caspian to the throne. But the victory is bittersweet for Peter and Susan are told that they will never return to Narnia again.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
After Edmund, Lucy, and their obnoxious cousin Eustace are pulled through a painting of a ship and land in the Narnian sea (this occurred in the last few moments of Prince Caspian), they are rescued by King Caspian who is on a voyage. King Caspian's mission is to discover the fate of seven noble Narnian lords who were sent into exile by Caspian's evil uncle, Miraz. Edmund and Lucy are thrilled to be reunited with Caspian, as well as the courageous swashbuckling mouse, Reepicheep. Eustace, on the other hand, does nothing but complain and instigate conflict with members of the ship's crew.
On the first island that they reach, Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep are taken captive by a group of uncouth slave traders. The traders sell Caspian to a nobleman, who is revealed to be Lord Bern, one of the seven missing lords. With Lord Bern's help Caspian rescues his friends from the slave market and abolishes the slave trade.
Shortly after leaving the island, they weather a terrible storm only to have the wind die down completely, leaving them drifting in the middle of the sea. As their rations dissipate and hope of reaching an island before they starve fades, a great wind carries them a great distance and they reach another island. While everyone else searches the island for provisions, Eustace, unsurprisingly too lazy to help in any way, wanders off to avoid work. He falls asleep in a cave, which turns out to be the lair of a dragon, and when Eustace awakens he's stunned by the realization that he's become a dragon himself. After using his newfound strength and his ability to fly to aid Caspian and the crew, Aslan shows Eustace mercy and transforms him back into a human child. The crew discovers that the Lord Octesian perished on the island, either devoured by a dragon or having turned into one long ago. They leave the island behind and continue their journey to find the five remaining lords, but Eustace is far more pleasant company than before. One night a giant serpent attacks the ship, but thanks to Reepicheep's quick thinking no one is hurt.  The next island they arrive at is enchanted and the water turns everything that it touches into gold. Edmund and Caspian are momentarily consumed by greed before discovering that the water claims the lives of anyone who bathes in it. They find the third Narnian lord turned into a golden statue and abruptly leave the accursed island behind.
After that they beach on an island inhabited by strange invisible creatures that want Lucy to help them become visible again. She must find a magician's spellbook and break the enchantment. After doing this she meets Coriakin, the venerable magician, who turns out to be a jovial wizard and he helps the crew repair the damage done to the ship by the sea serpent. Caspian and the others depart Coriakin's island and continue their voyage further into uncharted waters. Then they reach a deep impenetrable fog-enshrouded island where nightmares become a living reality. The crew barely escapes with their sanity intact and having rescued Lord Rhoop, whose mind is exhausted from years of living in abject terror.
Next they reach an island where a banquet table awaits them... with the three remaining lords sitting there fast asleep. Fearful of a dark enchantment, no one dares to eat from the table, but then a beautiful princess tells them that the table was put their to reward travelers with the courage to have sailed so far. Caspian, determined to revive the three sleeping lords, asks the princess how he might restore them. They are informed that they must travel to the ends of the Earth and there leave behind a member of their party. The princess introduces them to her father, Ramandu, a retired star. But the question remains: who shall be left at the world's end?

Both films, Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, feature a talented cast (mostly of unknowns) including Richard Dempsey as Peter, Sophie Cook as Susan, Jonathan R. Scott as Edmund, Sophie Wilcox as Lucy, Jean Marc Perret as Prince Caspian, Robert Lang as King Miraz, Big Mick as Trumpkin, Warwick Davis as Reepicheep, David Thwaites as Eustace, Samuel West as King Caspian, Preston Lockwood as Coriakin, Gabrielle Anwar as The Princess, Geoffrey Bayldon as Ramandu, and Ronald Pickup as the voice of Aslan. Of the cast, Warwick Davis as Reepicheep is delightful, and David Thwaites is wonderful as the appropriately irritating Eustace.
Both of these classic BBC productions are sure to cast a spell on your family.
