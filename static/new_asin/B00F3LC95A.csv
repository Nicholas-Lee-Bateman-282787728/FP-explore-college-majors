5966325,5,B00F3LC95A,"I love these double discs! I recently went looking for DVDs of two favorite films, MARATHON MAN and THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, and I found both of them in double-disc packages with two other favorites, BLACK SUNDAY and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. Both sets have excellent widescreen versions of the movies with good picture and sound. And both sets have really great prices. So I ended up with 4 great films instead of two--and for less than I thought I'd have to spend. Now, that's a bargain!

This package has two really intense thrillers from 1976 and 1977, with great directors, John Schlesinger (MARATHON MAN) and John Frankenheimer (BLACK SUNDAY). They also both have the same leading lady, beautiful Swiss actress Marthe Keller (THE FORMULA, FEDORA, etc.).

MARATHON MAN is a creepy cat-and-mouse game that pits a vicious Nazi war criminal (Laurence Olivier) against an innocent college student (Dustin Hoffman) and his girlfriend (Keller) in 1970s New York City. When Hoffman's CIA agent brother (Roy Scheider) is murdered by the Nazi, he becomes inadvertently involved in the villain's attempt to retrieve a stolen fortune. The Nazi was a dentist in the death camps, and that fact leads to one of the most excruciating interrogation scenes you'll ever see. (""Is it safe?"") Goldman wrote the screenplay based on his own bestselling novel, and Schlesinger (MIDNIGHT COWBOY) once again makes NYC seem like the most sinister place on earth.

In light of recent historical events, BLACK SUNDAY is no longer the same movie I saw in a theater in 1977. I was a college student then, and the story of fanatical Islamic terrorists planning to blow up the Super Bowl (with the President of the United States in attendance) seemed like great fun. Not anymore. Now, this long, detailed film seems more like a cautionary tale than entertainment. It is practically a step-by-step ""How To"" instruction manual for lunatics. Based on the bestselling novel by Thomas Harris (RED DRAGON, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), it is a truly chilling experience. Marthe Keller is the crazy terrorist in charge of the deadly plot, with Bruce Dern (COMING HOME, NEBRASKA) as her even crazier American accomplice. Robert Shaw (JAWS, THE STING) is the Israeli Mossad agent who tries to stop them. Frankenheimer (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) keeps the big story racing to the jaw-dropping finale. (Note: this movie was filmed long before the invention of CGI special effects, so most of what you see actually had to be staged. Amazing!)

So, two great thrillers for one low price! (PS: The other double album I mentioned is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-The-President-Men-Three-Days-of-The-Condor-DBFE/dp/B00AMSTXSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All The President Men / Three Days of The Condor (DBFE)</a>.

5966326,5,B00F3LC95A,Black Sunday is a movie in which the plot is very real in today's world.  Very cool that they filmed the movie during a real Super Bowl game.  Marathon Man has one of the most intense scenes ever.  I really hate dentists after watching this one,1411344000,2,244,4.260869565217392
5966327,5,B00F3LC95A,"They don't make movies like this any more. Two great films. I remember these two movies played together in the theaters as a double-feature in 1977. It was Black Sunday's second run. Marathon Man first followed by Black Sunday, one of my all time favorite movies. I've always wished they would do a remake of this movie but, it will never happen because of the subject. NFL would never cooperate these days. If you've never seen these two movies, lucky you because you're about to be entertained.",1411257600,,496,4.712643678160919
5966328,5,B00F3LC95A,Dustin does heck of job in this thriller. Zell is masterful and gets what he deserves in the end.,1409270400,,97,4.157894736842105
5966329,5,B00F3LC95A,"I haven't watched these yet. Again I've seen these years ago on CRT TV. I'm looking forward to the 50"" flat screen experience. Again a fine addition to my DVD library.",1405468800,,167,4.419354838709677
8611987,5,B00F3LC95A,"Two great flicks which have somehow fallen through the cracks of the ""classic""filter. I had not seen either movie since seeing them in the theater forty years ago,but they hold up well and I would recommend them to anyone particularly if haven't seen them before.",1522800000,,263,4.866666666666666
8611988,5,B00F3LC95A,Both movies are classics that a thoroughly enjoyed when they first came out and even enjoy them more now.,1483488000,,105,4.578947368421052

8611991,5,B00F3LC95A,I saw the movies when they originally came out in the theater. They were as good as I remembered them.,1476057600,,102,4.15
8611992,3,B00F3LC95A,"Features two films about foreigners who aspire to do bad things in the United States. Black Sunday is about a Viet Nam POW who along with a gal aspire to crash a Goodyear blimp into the Super Bowl. Sky high tension and a surprising amount of shooting.

Marathon Man is about a guy who aspires to run a marathon, he is in training. He meets a gal, his brother who is an international traveler comes to visit, he concludes the girl may have bad motives. a German baddie is mixed into the plot along with dental hygiene and diamonds. A suprising amount of shooting",1464998400,,561,4.394230769230769
8611993,4,B00F3LC95A,Great acting in the movie with very big stars about a very important subject. I was never bored but the story stayed with one theme instead of intertwining several topics but it was enjoyable to watch and I will watch it again.,1462147200,,227,4.428571428571429
8611994,5,B00F3LC95A,Watched them both in their film release and wanted them for home entertainment.,1451520000,,79,5.153846153846154

8611996,5,B00F3LC95A,"Both of these stories are exceptionally told.  In BLack Sunday, how the blimp pilot got to where he is at, how the VA turns its back on him
and how he just plans to blow up the stadium and the terrorist that he loves  Quite a story, it's made better and more suspensful by having
Robert Shaw included in the story. As a non stop Israeli secret police agent, he is the best. He does not pull any punches and wants only
to catch the terrorist and stop this all from happening. I recommed this story  5 stars!!
In Marathon Man, the story all starts with a traffic accident. The younger brother of a WW2 nazi death camp doctor  the ""White Angel"",
is brought out of hiding and forced to come to New York to collect the diamonds that his brother was going to smuggle out of the city. Enter
Dustin Hoffman and his brother a ""businessman"" who is really a spy, not sure for which organization, played  masterfully by Roy Scheider
who happens to know the ""White Angel' from other business they have had together. Scheider does not like the White Angel and in a meeting
tells him so and the White Angel snaps out a knife and stabs him to get rid of him.
Scheider limps back to Hoffman's apt and dies in front of him, trying to tell him something but he dies as soon as he hits the floor. The White Angel
was a dentist in the Concentration Camps and he comes looking for Hoffman, Don't want to ruin the story, see the movie, there are lots of down
right sscary parts in it It will make you think about seeingn a dentist  thats for sure",1444176000,4,1523,4.23448275862069
