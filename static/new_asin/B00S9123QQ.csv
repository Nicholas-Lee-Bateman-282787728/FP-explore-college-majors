6965158,5,B00S9123QQ,Think that Supernatural is one of the best programmes eva to come onto TV!! Personally find it to be alot better than 'The X-Files' ever was. Jared and Jensen are sooooo hot and do an excellent job at playing brothers whose mission is to save people and hunt things.  A must see for all lovers of the paranormal combined with cute guys. I can't wait for season 3!!,1212624000,,364,4.352941176470588
6965159,5,B00S9123QQ,"I must admit that Supernatural is one of my favourite shows. I have both seasons, and even the weakest episode from each season is stronger than the strongest episode of many of the television series I have seen over the years. The episodes are well written and the cast works together quite well. The tone of each season runs from amusing, like in Hell House (Season 1) and Hollywood Bablyon (Season 2), to downright sad/tragic, like in Heart (Season 2), with the rest of the shows falling somewhere in between. Many of the episodes are scary, such as the episode with the clown, but they transcend mere horror. I won't give away too many plot points, but I will say that this is a series I am proud to say I own, and I am waiting for the third season to come out on DVD.",1208044800,,772,4.3310344827586205
6965160,5,B00S9123QQ,"This show is awesome... it really is. But what is the deal with the pricing here? You can get both of them separately for $40 each. That's 80 bucks right? Well to buy both in a combo pack it costs $107. What the hell? That makes no sense. Guess I know how I'm purchasing these. And if anyone out there is stupid enough to purchase this particular item (both in a combo pack), well, you're probably too stupid to even understand the show. Or to even order anything online. Or to even read this. Get my point?",1203811200,,507,4.237113402061856
6965161,5,B00S9123QQ,"My 16 year old daughter said she has never seen anything so sexy. She loves it that the brothers are so close.

6965162,5,B00S9123QQ,"My sisters and I have been watching this nonstop since they arrived in the mail.  It is an EXCELLENT series; it has all the classic spookiness and creep factor, while keeping a very grounded approach that could almost make you believe those two are really out there saving the day!",1199577600,4,281,4.62
6965163,5,B00S9123QQ,"My son is very happy with this gift.  He's a huge fan of the show and is enjoying watching them without commercials.  He is also enjoying the deleted scenes and out takes.  As always, this was delivered in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  Thx P.Brown",1198713600,,262,4.51063829787234

6965166,4,B00S9123QQ,"The content gets four stars because I really enjoy this show. But this is nonsensical pricing for a 2 season package. Season 1 is less than $24, and season 2 is priced at less than $38. So purchased individually it costs around $62 for the two seasons, but if you act now you can pay $107.89 and get a combo pack of the same two seasons. I guess they must use more expensive plastic to bind them together!",1188950400,19,405,4.205128205128205

6965171,5,B00S9123QQ,"I really enjoy the series but this pricing game is wild. I purchased seasons 4 ,6,and 7 for $15.99 each.excellent quility. Seasons 1 and 2 I purchased for $17.99 each. All at Walmart. Sometimes it pays to be patient and wait for the best deal. Nothing against Amazon , but this is one of the few times they have been beaten in their pricing.",1401926400,,341,4.34375

6965173,5,B00S9123QQ,I happened upon this series when it started this season and loved it so much that I purchased the previous 3 seasons. My whole family is hooked and my 10 year old son can't wait for Thursday nights so he can watch Sam & Dean. You will not be disappointed with this original and well acted series.,1226966400,,296,4.2105263157894735

6965176,1,B00S9123QQ,why would you pay so much more for a two pack of the seasons when you could purchase the seasons seperately and get it for cheaper??? its the exact same thing. doesnt look like anything extra added to it. i don't understand why they even bothered with this. i guess its to lure in people who don't know how to shop around for decent prices.,1220313600,4,340,4.246153846153846

8697820,1,B00S9123QQ,This series is terrible. There are too many liberties and grave errors about spiritual warfare in this silly show. It is quite laughable and a joke for those of us who actually are in battle with the dark forces. This series is only for the ignoirant.,1504742400,,251,4.478260869565218
