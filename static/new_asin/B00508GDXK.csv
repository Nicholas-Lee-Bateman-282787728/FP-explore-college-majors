4513511,5,B00508GDXK,"An excellent collection of movies, and great value.  The intriguing crime drama of ""Consenting Adults"", with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, the absorbing prison drama of ""An Innocent Man"", with Tom Selleck, and the very entertaining comedy/drama, featurig the incredibly seductive Kim Basinger as a nightclub entertainer (and a gangster's moll on the side - an unfortunate love interest for Alec Baldwin in the title role.)  A veritable feast of entertainment!",1357171200,,458,5.6231884057971016
4513512,3,B00508GDXK,"I bought this mostly for ""An innocent Man"" as I didn't really like the other movies when they came out. I hadn't seen the movie since it came out and it wasn't as good as I remember. If I didn't know better I would think that it was a Lifetime movie. The acting was below expectation for the actors involved, but maybe it was Tom Selleck trying to break his nice guy image after Magnum. I think if they re-edited it, it would be a lot better. The plot was still good however.",1317859200,,475,4.118279569892473
4513513,5,B00508GDXK,"Great buy, three movies for the bargin price of one.  All feature Tom Selleck.  You can't go wrong.  I have never seen Tom Selleck in a movie or TV Show that I haven't enjoyed.  From his hit show Magnum PI, to his most receint roll as Police Chief of Paridise Island TV Movies.  To his roll as police commishioner in Blue Bloods I have enjoyed his acting for years.",1312156800,,365,4.231884057971015

4513515,4,B00508GDXK,"This is a two-movie package, so all the reviews saying ""fantastic movie"" are not very helpful. Anyway, these are two movies with vaguely similar plots about the imprisonment of an innocent man, and his eventual release and revenge. One is very good, the other is . . . watchable. Packaged as a double-sided DVD with no extras, it's a good deal for the price.

CONSENTING ADULTS
This a good movie that did well in theaters. Starring Kevin Kline, Kevin Spacey, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, with Forrest Whittaker in a supporting role, it's sexy, dramatic, and suspenseful. The story is that happily-married Kline and Mastrantonio find themselves getting involved with their new neighbors, Kevin Spacey and Rebecca Miller. Spacey is a con man who keeps pushing them to go further and further into wilder and riskier behavior. Finally he proposes wife-swapping, goading Kline into spending the night with Spacey's wife, who he is attracted to. Kline gives in, but wakes up in the morning to find her dead in the bed, and Spacey screaming that he is a murderer. Kline's wife divorces him and he goes to prison for a crime he knows he didn't commit. He then devotes himself to clearing his name and getting back what he lost. The movie is kind of a ""Body Heat"" with more detective work and less sex; Kline and Spacey are great as always with their familiar bewildered decency and scheming creepiness, respectively. A good movie with some disturbing themes and scenes.

AN INNOCENT MAN
This is a sadly predictable movie with a few decent moments. Tom Selleck stars as a cardboard-cutout upright working man with a beautiful and devoted wife. Two rogue cops mistakenly burst into his house and shoot him on a drug raid at the wrong address, then plant evidence to frame him to cover up their mistake. Selleck refuses to take a plea and goes to prison, where he is caught between warring gangs until a kindly older prisoner schools him and he learns to toughen up, use swear words, and grow his moustache longer to look like a badass. The dialog is painfully stilted (""I won't plead guilty to something I didn't do! It would be wrong!"" ""But what about justice!?""), and almost all the actors - especially Selleck - deliver it woodenly. The prison gangs are, frankly, racist stereotypes (even the white ones). He is eventually released from prison but the dirty cops won't leave him alone, so - with the help of his new convict buddies - he sets out on his own mission of revenge, culminating in a brawl/shootout/car chase that lets Selleck do some Magnum P.I. stunts like flying off the hood of a moving car and running the bad guy down and disarming him single-handed. Laila Robins is charming as his too-perfect wife. F. Murray Abraham steals the show as the grizzled older convict who helps Selleck survive prison and guides him to get his revenge with an absurd plot that he masterminds from inside the prison. (He has the best lines in the film, but you can see him thinking to himself ""I won a Best Actor Oscar for 'Amadeus'! What the hell am I doing here?"")

Two nights' worth of entertainment, ranging from average to very good. Not recommended for kids.",1441670400,2,3156,4.734545454545454
