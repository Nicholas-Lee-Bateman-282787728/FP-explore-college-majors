7902796,5,B000003KAM,"I enjoyed thise episode of Star Trek Voyager and consider it to be a strong beginning for Season Three of the show.
This episode, which bears the production number episode 46, was actually shown as the first episode of season three.  It is the continuation of the story begun in episode 42 - ""Basics Pt I"".
At the beginning of this episode, Janeway and the Voyager crew are stranded on a remote and dangerous planet after the Kazon take over Voyager in ""Basics I"". Of course, this episode covers the retaking of Voyager by the Starfleet crew.  But also included are final resolutions of the Seska/Chakotay relationship and of the nagging doubts about the paternity of Seska's child.
Strong writing and good acting combine to make this an important Voyager episode.  I give it 5 stars.",997747200,5,784,4.75
