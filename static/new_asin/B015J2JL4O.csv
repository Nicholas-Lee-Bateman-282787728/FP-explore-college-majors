The movie shows aspects of Indian life and romance that echo with happenings in societies all around the world, such as corruption in policemen.  There is happiness and sadness in the movie and it deals with death, which is important to face and accept.",1476230400,,390,4.705882352941177
8733755,5,B015J2JL4O,"I absolutely loved this film. I will review this movie by its features and plot.
Features: I think that the director did a great job not utilizing artificial life. The scenes in the movie were spectacular with natural lights. The subtitles were great for me since I do not speak Hindi and I loved the idea that language was not a barrier for me to enjoy this masterpiece.
Plot: In my opinion, this film is the best Indian movie of 2015. I absolutely adored the themes involved in the plot. The film had suspense, family dynamics, first love encounter, sadness, tragic events and, finally, the role of destiny in our lives. Everyone must watch this since it could be viewed as a metaphor of modern India. As India is trying to achieve a balance between modernity and tradition, so are the characters of this movie.",1475798400,2,813,4.613793103448276

8733757,5,B015J2JL4O,"I could not find a way to watch this movie that everyone had been raving about. Finally I bought the DVD and for once I agreed with the critics - everything that has been said about this film is true. It is that good.
The film is about different characters who live in Benaras and are unrelated and who finally come together at the end.
The director Neeraj Ghaywan and the writer Varun Grover using their knowledge of Benares weave a story that epitomises India and its small town.
The casting is perfect because every player is perfect and looks the part. The evil cop, the friends who are crazy about women. A standing ovation to the central parts Sanjay Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Shweta Tripathi, Richa Chadha 
but the discovery of the film wasVicky Kaushal playing Deepak, the love-struck yet ambitious student who shines brilliantly.

The everyday conversations between people, the awkward discussion about premarital sex between the father and the daughter are just brilliant. The Durga Pooja scene possibly the most romantic and captures the sweetness of love in its infancy. Trust me, the sights and the visuals make this a particular scene one of the best composed situations in recent memory. The soundtrack from the band Indian Ocean was just wonderful.
Masaan is a complex, multi layered portrayal of India especially the India in the small cities- it captures the fear and the hope, the failures and successes, the innocence and the corruption, not to forget the dusty roads, colorful festivals along with lives and deaths.
Please experience it at the earliest.
