4884465,5,B005SH65S6,"Excellent series. Good stories. Well acted. One gets used to the regional dialect used by the actors and as a matter of fact, it adds a feeling of authenticity to the stories portrayed.",1345507200,,185,4.636363636363637
4884466,5,B005SH65S6,"They are putting all of this series out in region one. this is the show circa 2000 or so. their fifth series and the best so far. In this one murderers get away with crime even! The show features alot of great yorkshire landscape too. So it's northern england south of scotland and it's mainly on the coast. they are not releasing this as fast as many of us would like in this region but it will eventually all be available on dvd in the u.s. And unlike mainstream movies which are being phased out of production on dvd. yes, dvd's are on the way out in that regard , tv series will still be coming out on dvd for years. This is a strong picture on this one too. As it was shot on high grade film which looks great still. This series has a the boys dealing with mariatal problems and estranged girlfriends etc too. The show was one of the better brit detective shows on tv during it's run for sure. 1996-2007. It's a strong show in many regards and that's a fact. It's worth owning too as the shows acting is superb ,although the chain smoking dalziel is a man heading for a stroke probably if he hasn't quit smoking by series 12. I have yet to see a bad episode of this show or even a boring one, so lets hope they finish releasing this show on dvd in the next few years.",1338854400,3,1272,4.133064516129032
4884467,5,B005SH65S6,"New  fascinating stories,  very well written characters ! When ordering this I thought we had seen then and was DELIGHTED to realize that this is a new to USA series!!",1337126400,,167,4.533333333333333
4884468,5,B005SH65S6,"Detective Superintendent Inspector Andy Dalziel is a force of nature and a wily foe. Under that pugnacious exterior is a ferocious intelligence. Yorkshire is not the charming but murderous environs of Midsomer, or Detective Chief Inspector Morse's Oxford. This series features mysteries with the roughness of the rolling Yorkshire dales and Dalziel's formidable form. To quote the Fat Man, ""A man who can play the bagpipes shouldn't have trouble with this job."" Colin Buchanan convincingly contrasts as Detective Inspector Peter Pascoe, trying to cope with balancing work and life.

A Sweeter Lazarus: Is the resident of a homeless shelter the long-lost victim of abduction, long believed to have been killed, or a fraud? Our Andy fights for the truth in an old, revived case, while poor Peter Pascoe battles his wife; Ellie seems to have changed the rules on him.

Cunning Old Fox: Don't pee up Dalziel's leg and tell him it's raining. Or sprinkle fox piss on our Andy's coat. He's liable to protect the maligned fox from the local hunt, just to get his Yorkshire way. The plot is a bit unlikely, but no more so than other U.K. mysteries, where the merest of motives seems to send otherwise respectable British denizens into murderous rages.

Foreign Bodies: The standout of the bunch, featuring a recovering (from his gun-shot wounds) Dalziel in an amorous mode with an old flame (he has many) in a beautiful, massive Victorian hotel on the coast. Dracula-like, a body washes ashore in a coffin, a black dog roams the seaside resort, and Stella Moon (the same actress who played the Midsomer psychiatrist who spawned evil children) uses her ripe feminine whiles on our susceptible voluptuary, Andy. Bront fans may especially enjoy a mystery that includes their blustery Yorkshire landscape. Enjoy!

Above the Law: Peter discovers his talents as a man who is committed to his calling as Law Enforcement Officer, while his marriage further disintegrates. Ellie was just as annoying in Reginald Hill's books, not extending her limited compassion to her husband, just on self-righteous social causes. A gay judge is killed, and Dalziel suspects financial and political intrigue are at the heart of the matter.

PS: For those of you who want more, Series 6 - 11 are available for Region 2. Series 6 and 7 are worth it; the show drastically declines in quality after that, as reviewers in the U.K. note. Even in the U.K., you can't get these Series without Dutch subtitles (it's easy to turn them off by selecting UIT under Ondertitls on the main menu).

4884469,5,B005SH65S6,"You can't help but feel sorry for Pascoe having to put up with Dalziel's rudeness, but that's because the acting is so good.  The story lines are fresh and it is easy to get involved with the characters--that means the acting is good!",1334188800,,234,4.441860465116279
4884470,5,B005SH65S6,"Separated from his wife, Pascoe, (greatly acted by Colin Buchanan) in Season five (5) of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"",  has become a very unlikely roommate of Dalziel (wonderfully acted by Warren Clark).  This living arrangement between Dalziel and Pascoe really emphasized that the two British detectives are not only very different in their approaches to solving murders but they are extremely different ""privately"".

Recovering from his gunshot wound in last season, Dalziel, in Season five (5) is back with his very keen insights  but seemly uncouth and rough manners solving horrendous and well written murders that include a ""well preserved corpse"" floating in the sea in a casket, murder of a judge that has a hidden life, etc.  Likewise very debonair and mellow in his dealings with suspects but surprisingly very untidy in his personal life, Pascoe also solves this season some nasty murders.  In spite of their differences, Dalziel and Pascoe make a very good team solving the splendidly written cases in Season five (5) of this great series.(This season was filmed in the late 1990s, thus the ""team"" get a little more ""high tech"" help solving the murders from their computers)

I really enjoyed Season five (5) of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" because it is so well written, directed and, most of all, acted--I adore the ""night and day"" differences in Pascoe and Dalziel.",1334188800,,1365,5.066964285714286
4884471,4,B005SH65S6,"The first time I viewed Dalziel & Pascoe was on TVO, years ago.  Enjoyed it thoroughly but wasn't hooked until it was in re-runs on TV somewhat later.  The first four series captured the spirit, wit and delicious Yorkshire sensibility extremely well from Reginald Hill's superb series. Starting with Series 5, the episodes are original teleplays ""based on the characters"" of Hill. Have to say, though, in contrast with another reviewer, while I enjoyed 'Foreign Bodies' for the droll take on the black widow theme, the outcome was preposterous, given five bodies to her credit.

The casting of the key characters is perfect: Colin Buchanan as Pascoe in the early series is indeed very dishy, and a charmingly wry counterpoint to Warren Clarke's acerbic, deliberately crude Dalziel. He's perfection.  Suzanne Corbett, although not physically like her written character captures exactly the shoot-from-the-lip feisty, social activist cum writer wife of Pascoe and David Royle couldn't be better as Wieldy.  Supporting cast is terrific and guest stars and other cast as precisely cast as the others.

I too discovered the The Best on DVD, the Netherlands distributor that did what BBC didn't do:  make the whole series available, though only on Region 2 format.  Like another reviewer's idea of hooking up and downloading via computer and/or then onto the TV screen, but need a more tech-savvy friend to help do that.

Learned from a friend who worked at TVO years ago who found out from the BBC marketing guy that U.S. interest in the series wasn't that high and without that huge market it wasn't worth their while to produce in Region 1 format.  Then, what's the excuse for not having the series available in England, except for seasons 1 and 2?  Wasn't available in London, when i was there in 2009.

Happy that Amazon now sells the whole series, albeit in Region 2 format!

4884551,5,B005SH65S6,"2 lead characters are from the novels of Reginald Hill keep the action and suspense moving. Season 5 is 4 feature-length episodes that aired in 2000.
I bought and viewed REGION 1 DVDs, USA/Canada. Some reviews were written prior to them being available.
 DS Andy Dalziel, he pronounces it Dee-el, (Warren Clarke) heads the cop team with a sour face and disposition, but also provides the occasional suspense breaking laugh. His main man, DI Peter Pascoe (Colin Buchanan) is much more new-school and systematic in sleuthing approach, but struggles in this series with marital strife. Season 5 has DS Wield (David Royle) and DC Ivor Novello (Jo-Anne Stockham) assisting. Episodes have fine acting ability and guest stars, but it is the excellent multi-layered writing merging to a finale that makes this show one of the greats. The show lasted over a decade, 1996 to 2007.
The Yorkshire scenes are lovely (home of the Bronte authors.)

SDH SUBTITLES for all 4 episodes; each 1  hr. NO bonus.
1 A SWEETER LAZARUS: A witness (Nicola Walker -`Last Tango in Halifax'; `MI-5') to a suicide jump off a building by a murderer must testify to release Pascoe of responsibility. But she claims to be a former kidnap victim that was killed. Pascoe's job is on the line--his marriage just as shaky. Oops, WDC Kendell has a corpse in her flat.

2 CUNNING OLD FOX: A death on the green hillside during a hunt is determined to be suspicious. Pascoe's rooming wit Dalziel; who seems to agree with critics of the hunting sport. Dalziel sends his female team copper undercover in the posh horse community. `Master of the Hunt' is David Calder (Bramwell; Titanic)

3 FOREIGN BODIES: A body washes up onto the beach like flotsam--ASTONISHINGLY embalmed and in a casket. An old flame invites Dalziel for a seaside rendezvous as the rest of the team investigates a motorway death. Dalziel and romance is a stretch. An activist author and a bus tourist's death add to the plot mix.

4 ABOVE THE LAW: A judge is shot dead. Was it the heroin dealer being tried, the judge's office seeking spouse, the judges boyfriend, the spouse's lover, . . . ? Ellie Pascoe has a message for her estranged husband. Politics, crime, and personal lives conflict. Judge Chance's wife played by Celia Imrie (`Cranford', `Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'). She's good, and did you know a second BEMHotel is in production?

Hill but on the characters he created, the production company has done a good job. I have purchased several seasons and like them all. The actors are well  chosen. Shipping was right on target.",1346025600,,346,4.323076923076923
8484985,3,B005SH65S6,"Have been watching these on Amazon Prime with a BritBox subscription.  Generally, I wish they were better.  Dalziel is one dimensional and for a detective who is supposed to be an ace at figuring things out, we never actually see his thought processes.  The actor playing Pascoe cannot summon up an emotion on his face to save his life.  The best of the bunch is Sgt. Wield, the actor playing him is simply amazing.

Probably my least favorite episode of ALL the seasons is ""Foreign Bodies"" from Season 5.  The plot simply makes no sense.  Dalziel recieves a postcard from an old flame who entices him to a seaside hotel in Whitby, North Yorkshire.  Bodies of her ex-husbands are turning up left and right, and Dalziel figures out that she was married to all four men although she, incomprehensibly, denies this until he corners her.  She may be a raging psychopath but Dalziel is more interested in a roll in the hay with her.  She is in her 50's and finally tells him she has married a 22 year old ""for his youth"" - wherever this husband was during the week she and Dalziel were cozying up, we don't know, but he shows up on the pier and she seems to be expecting him and pushes him into the water, claiming he tried to kill her.  It appears pretty likely that she set him up to kill at least three of her four previous husbands so she could inherit from them.  What does Dalziel do after he essentially solves this?  Has another roll in the hay with her and wishes her well as she runs off for a South American cruise, presumably to snag husband number 6.  How does ANY of this make sense?  Dalziel is not the type of detective to let a serial murderer waltz off into the sunset, regardless of how good in the sack she is... I was gobsmacked at how little sense this episode made.",1529625600,,1783,4.36060606060606
8484986,3,B005SH65S6,"These shows faithfully reflect author Reginald Hills characters.  They are not, however, taken from the authors novels.  The last two episode from Season 4 were written by others, and all four of the shows in Season 5 were also written by other writers.  The acting is still superb, though, in all of the episode I have seen, so far.  As always, I recommend American viewers to turn on English subtitles to assist with the vernacular of Yorkshire, England.  I had almost no trouble understanding what was taking place, but I had subtitles turned on.  There are four episodes in Season 5.

The first episode is titled A Sweeter Lazarus.  Although based on the characters developed by author Reginald Hill for his Dalziel & Pascoe police procedural novels, it was actually written by Michael Jenner.  The opening scene portrays Andy Dalziel gazing from the window of his home.  He sits down and opens a newspaper, but soon gets up, says Stuff this to himself, and leaves for the pub.  As Dalziel enters the pub, he sees DS Wield, who stands frozen in surprise.  Immediately, everybody in the pub stops talking and stands staring at Dalziel, who says: Whats up?  Never seen a ghost before?  Dalziel had been shot by members of the SWAT team in Season 4, and had been gone from work for three months recovering from two bullet wounds to the chest.  Dalziel soon meets the new Acting Chief Constable, Rebecca Fenning, when he mistakes her for a stripper, but she doesnt hold his mistake against him, and the two get on well.  Fenning is played by Pippa Haywood.

Meanwhile, DI Pascoe is on a stakeout at a womens shelter after two homeless women had been murdered.  He has sent a Woman Detective Constable (WDC) on loan from a different department into the shelter to work undercover.  Her name is Shaz Kendall, and she is played by Amita Dhiri.  She soon discovers another murder and summons Pascoe, who alerts other officers.  In a short time, Pascoe becomes a subject of suspicion for pushing the perpetrator off the roof.  The only witness, a homeless woman who saw everything, claims she saw nothing.  Upon checking her name, it is discovered that she claims to be a missing girl who was kidnapped and thought to have been murdered in Yorkshire when she was thirteen years old.  Is she really the missing girl?  Dalziel doesnt believe it, but others do.  What is the truth?

The kidnapped girl was named Abbie Hallingsworth.  Her role is played by Nicola Walker.  She has two brothers, David and Martin, and the three of them have inherited their fathers brewery.  Each has a one-third share.  The brewery could be sold to a German company for a considerable sum, but is it enough to justify murder?

More are murdered before the case is solved, and there is (of course) a chase scene in the brewery.  To me, this episode seemed more like a cheesy American network TV police drama than a quality production of the kind I have come to expect from the BBC.  Apparently, the writers have run out of ideas, and the producers decided to abandon the novels of Reginald Hill as a source for their stories (too expensive?).  I thought the direction in this episode was especially bad and can award it no more than two stars.  I didn't like it much.

The second episode is titled Cunning Old Fox.  It was written by Steve Attridge and Malcolm Bradbury.  The opening scene shows a lot of men and women on horses chasing a fox across fields with hedgerows, while animal rights activists and hunt followers watch and film from the nearby woods.  Georgina was bringing up the rear of the pack of horses when hers rears and throws her off.  She is killed in the fall.  Was it an accident?

The Master of Hounds receives a threatening letter, and Dalziel decides to have the body of Georgina exhumed, and he begins a suspicious death  investigation.  Sergeant Wield discovers evidence of foul play in the hedge, and the case is off and running.  More murders, and an attempted murder, ensue.  Woman Detective Constable (WDC) Novello goes undercover, but her true identity is quickly figured out by the killer.  The murderer is soon identified, and a chase takes place.  Not in time, however, to prevent one more murder.

I didn't particularly like this episode.  For one thing, the title did not seem to fit the story.  I could tell that it had not been written by Reginald Hill.  The plot was straightforward, but somewhat predictable.  I wish the BBC had stuck with Reginald Hills stories.  They were a lot better than the stories that are being portrayed now.  I do not believe that Hill would ever have had his WDC go undercover.  That is a stale ploy used a lot by American TV writers, and not what I would expect to see in high-quality British drama from the BBC.  Only three stars for this episode.

The third episode, Foreign Bodies, is a story about four male bodies that suddenly appear in Yorkshire.  All are men.  The first is in a casket that float ashore from the sea.  It contains a remarkably preserved body of an elderly man.  The second body is found under a highway overpass beneath his French-made automobile that is parked on the overpass.  Two more men are killed, and Dalziel begins to suspect the involvement of an old flame that he has reconnected with in Scarborough.  He has met her accidently while on a doctor-ordered holiday and they meet in the hotel where they are both staying.  They rekindle their romance, but in the end, she leaves for a cruise to South America without him, although she makes it clear that he was welcome to join her if he wished.  In total, five foreign-born men are dead or injured in Yorkshire, and all five of them had previously been married to Dalziels old flame.  Coincidence?

The story for this episode was written by Malcolm Bradbury, and not by Reginald Hill.  We learn in this episode that Pascoe and his wife, Ellie, are in the midst of a divorce, and their daughter Rose is staying with her grandmother in Lincolnshire.  In the meantime, Pascoe is staying with Dalziel, who complains constantly about Pascoe failing to wash the dishes.

The ending of the show was quite unsatisfying to me, and at least one of the scenes involving a young man being pushed off a pier into the water was especially lame.  Although most of the loose ends are tied up, and we pretty much know who killed who, I did not like this episode at all, and will award it no more than two stars.

The fourth episode of Season 5 is titled Above the Law.  It was written by Matthew Hall.  The opening scene shows an elderly judge leaving his politician wife to walk to the newspaper stand for the Sunday newspapers.  Special Branch is in charge of his security because he had been threatened in relation to a case he was about to hear.  Instead, he walks into the woods, where he expects to meet his homosexual lover.  A motorcyclist approaches and shoots him twice in the chest with a handgun, and we have the first murder.

The wife, who is running for membership in the European Parliament, refuses to drop out of the race for MEP after her husbands murder, but she becomes the next victim of the murderer, who runs her off the road and almost kills her.  Dalziel and Pascoe run in circles as suspects and witnesses lie to them and withhold evidence.  In the meantime, Ellie gives Pascoe an ultimatum: he must choose her or the police department, but not both.  It appears that the marriage is over, but these shows are starting to look more and more like an American TV serial programs or soap operas, so who knows?

At the end, Dalziel is pulled off the case by the higher ups and resigns the force in disgust.  Obviously, his resignation won't be accepted, because that would mean the end of the series, and there are six more seasons to go.  The end of this episode was highly unsatisfying, and I would not recommend this one at all.  The only reason why I award more than a single star is because of the quality of the acting.  The stories are not nearly as good as those written by Reginald Hill.  I am disappointed in Season 5, and award only two stars..

This was not a very good season for this show, in my view.  Together, these four shows warrant no more than a three star rating.  A disappointing letdown.",1514764800,,8242,4.58670322138451
