8643839,4,B00IO637T8,"Great little short on an incredible luthier building a beautiful instrument and putting it in the hands of one of the most promising talents in the jazz world. The music is great and makes for a perfect solo guitar soundtrack. My only wish is that the building process was more in depth and revealed, and I wish the whole thing was longer! But still a fun short to watch and certainly worth the price. Do yourself a favor and check out both the luthier, Otto D'Ambrosio, and the guitarist, Julian Lage.",1408492800,,502,4.527472527472527
