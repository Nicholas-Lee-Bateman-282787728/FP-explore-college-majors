8027776,2,B0002F6ASE,"Hi, Boys and Girls!  It's time for another lesson in ""How to buy from Amzn and not get ripped-off!""  Ever look long and hard for a dvd of a film you thought you'd never find...and then one day you check here and--surprise!--here it is!  You're so happy to find it you go ahead and instantly order it and purchase it.  But you're in such a rush you neglect to look over the ""Product Details"" which, if you had taken the time to read, you'd have noticed there is no Studio or Company information for this release, which is a good bet that...you've just bought a bootleg disc! Now this isn't always a bad thing, per se, because sometimes it's better to have a hard to find film than not have it, but you should be aware that the picture quality on stuff like this is not gonna be 1080p, restored image quality.  In fact, it will probably resemble what this film would look like if you watched it on a VHS tape...which is probably where the transfer actually came from.  So...caveat emptor.",1424476800,,986,4.3901098901098905
8027777,1,B0002F6ASE,"I ordered this DVD from MovieMars, as I remembered seeing part of the movie being filmed in London in the 80s. Unfortunately what arrived was quite possibly the worst transfer of a movie to DVD that I have ever seen. Both picture and sound quality were, to put it mildly, appalling. Best to wait until someone does the job properly, but that could be a while away.",1253750400,9,364,4.447761194029851
