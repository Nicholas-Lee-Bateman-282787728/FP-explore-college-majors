288322,5,6300269477,"To go along with the first review about it being color.  The opening sequence ( airplane flying over New Mexican desert) was in color - remainder of the film was in black and white.  You'll love seeing James  Arness in a rle oter than that of Matt Dillon.  He really brings  ""life"" to this movie.  In the 90's it's rather ""campy""  but definetly worth watching.",927504000,,360,4.446153846153846

288478,1,6300269477,"Another classic movie ruined. Probably on purpose. The original movie is chopped or zoomed in to fit the new television screens. On this Blu-ray you no longer see the tops and bottoms of the film. Then that small portion of the film that is left has been enlarged to fit the screen. The chopping is horrible but the enlargement makes the whole movie blurry. After seeing this I hurriedly put my old DVD copy of Them in my safe deposit box. Then I went to Amazon to order another DVD copy. What do I find? The old original DVDs are now $40 each, and up. I will keep this trash Blue-ray and watch it so as to not take any chances of damaging my original dvd which had ALL the picture and a MUCH better picture than this trash Blu-ray.  But now that the movies is ruined I am sure I will watch it a lot less. If this is progress then I wish the ants would have won.",1522022400,,862,4.100591715976331

288522,2,6300269477,"It's amazing how opinions on this Blu-ray differ.  I watched it the other day for the first time, and I thought it looked like crap.  It's extremely grainy from start to finish, unacceptably so, and it's dark, I had to crank the brightness and the contrast way up to try to improve it, and afterward it still looks like crap. It's generally a dull image, although it improves in some scenes.  Not at all what I would call a ""high definition"" image, but reading some other reviews I see that opinions about that vary wildly. The only thing Warner ""improved"" on over the DVD was that it's in widescreen, but that's no good if the image is subpar.  On the package we're told that image quality will vary depending on the quality of your playback equipment, which is (expletive deleted).  You shouldn't have to go out and buy a way more expensive LED TV and Blu-ray player than what you've already got, just to make a movie look as good as it's supposed to look.  Still sealed copies of the 2003 DVD are selling for high prices on ebay, which should tell you something about what most viewers thought of this Blu-ray.  Warner discontinued the DVD when they released the Blu-ray in 2015, and apparently they didn't see the backlash coming.  I've seen some screen shots reviewers have posted from the Blu-ray, and they look way better than what I saw when I screened the Blu-ray on my 32 inch Hitachi LED TV, so something isn't adding up here, and I'm not buying the crap that my playback equipment isn't good enough.  Steer clear of this Blu-ray and pick up the out-of-print DVD before it gets too expensive.",1520121600,,1603,4.538194444444445

288584,4,6300269477,"This film, the first in the ""big bug"" craze of 1950s monster movies, holds up superbly today. It's tense and atmospheric, with a smart script, solid acting, and a female scientist who, refreshingly, is neither a damsel in distress nor a tacked-on love interest, but a vital part of the team. The giant ants are truly impressive beasties for the time period - if they occasionally look a little googly eyed, well that's no major sin - when they are rampaging through darkened tunnels and crushing people in their jaws they are certainly no joke. A lot of sci-fi films from this time period come off as laughably quaint today, but this one's a real keeper.",1511136000,2,654,4.646551724137931

This is a movie about taller-ants.

This is not a fly-by-night movie. It is an ant-by-night movie.
William Schallert ""Colossus - The Forbid Project"" ASIN: 6300987531, gets to be the Ambulance Attendant.

 Leonard Nimoy is the Telex operator. If this keeps up, he may find himself on a starship, where he can deal with ant-imatter.

 James Arness only wants to help Joan Weldon out of a plane and into the ant-ichamber.

I watched this several times with my wife. The ants make a noise similar to a loose fan belt. So every time we pass a car with a loose fan belt she says, ""Get the other antenna.""

I have all the Universal Monster movies on BD and all of them are far superior to this terrible looking BD. ""The Mummy"" looks better than this movie and it is 20 years older! B/W movies are the worst when the transfer is done poorly and this is the case here. The movie? One of my favorites as a kid, it does not hold up well, sadly. It's 20 minutes too long, lots of chatty scenes that go on forever, ""Tarantula"" is much better in my adult opinion. No photo gallery. Lots of other ways to spend $13 and get a better movie.

288814,4,6300269477,"I've watched it a couple of times now and what struck me most about it is how well James Whitmore sells the picture. Right from the start, he's taking the movie seriously and that lets the viewer do the same. I believe this is the first ""giant bug"" movie and, unlike the knock-offs that followed, it's a high-quality studio picture. Younger viewers may roll their eyes at the creature effects, but they're very good.
My only real complaint with the movie itself is the lesson on ants in the middle of the film. It goes on too long and does more to slow the pace than increase the tension.
There's some kind of technical problem with the sound. On my Blu-Ray player, I have to change the output from surround to stereo in order to hear the English audio. I have an older player, so this may be something to do with new copy-protection tech. (Yes, I updated the player's firmware.)
Unfortunately, the most popular review of this Blu-Ray has some misleading information. Although a full-screen version of the movie is available on DVD, it was originally shown in theaters in a widescreen format. Like most every movie, it was shot on 35mm film, which has a full-screen aspect ratio. That doesn't mean the director intended you to see the entire frame. Sometimes, the part of the image that is supposed to be cropped is ""protected"" from boom mics and so on because the filmmakers knew it might be shown full-frame, but it's all extra information that doesn't add anything. (I saw Jurassic Park in a theater near the end of its first run, and the projectionist forgot to matte the image for the first 10-15 minutes, so there were boom mics following the actors at the top and bottom of the screen.) I've included a picture to refute one of the claims in the popular review: that the first appearance of a giant ant is delayed due to cropping. On the left is a DVD screenshot showing more picture at the top and bottom (and tiny slivers less on the side). At the right is a Blu-Ray screenshot of the same shot -- about a second before the top of the ant's head appears above the sand dune. (That round thing at the right is not the ant.) Also, note the DVD is lower in contrast and bright enough to wash out some of the detail in the sand -- in this shot at least. There are DVDs that are better than their Blu-Ray counterparts when the Blu-Ray has been done carelessly or with inferior sources. That's not the case here. Sometimes, it's a matter of preference, but you can't fault the Blu-Ray when it's showing you the film as it was originally shown.
Some trivia about the film: According to Hollywood legend, Fess Parker's performance caught Walt Disney's attention and led to his casting as Daniel Boone. Likewise, James Arness got his Gunsmoke role from this movie. That's the story, anyway.",1489622400,12,2790,4.548707753479126

288978,5,6300269477,"I watched these movies as a kid in Minneapolis on Mel Jazz's TV show and no doubt I was watching them along with the Coen Bros across town. Unfortunately the only take away for me was having watched really cool horror flicks from the 50's, they went on to do something with their education from Saturday afternoons in front of the tube :-)

This is a Warner Bros production and is pretty well done on all counts within the time period. James Whitmore and the rest of the cast are very good with the somewhat simplistic plot of atomic testing gone wrong. But this is what I love about these films, the context of the cold war and of new technology were a watershed of concepts during this period, some brilliant, some not so much but the final product (for me) never fails to entertain as it now is a peek into the mindset of this time period. The visual and sound effects are dated but convincing enough to make the movie above the standard B-movie horror/sci-fi fare of the day.

Later in my life I ran into s person who thought this was real, granted I think the person was probably touched, but I had to chuckle that anyone could think that such a thing was possible. Such is the power of movies!",1477785600,4,1199,4.348214285714286

This and movies like Rodan, Godzilla, Mothra and the original Dracula, Wolf Man, or Frankenstein movies.

As the narrative progresses, it appears that the earliest atomic tests in New Mexico have had some form of accumulative effect in the evolutionary path of certain invertebrate. The results are not good, as it causes common ants to metamorphose into giant man-eating freaks that threaten humanity.

Into the picture then come Edmund Gwenn and Joan Weldon, entomologists, and James Arness, FBI man. With the aid, of the military, in the form of air force officers Onslow Stevens and Sean McClory; the little group attempts to wipe out the nest of the mutated monsters with flamethrowers and gas  before they disperse across the world.

With good casting and decent script, all of which helped make the proceedings tense, interesting and, unexpectedly enough, rather convincing. Perhaps it is the film's austere and seemingly factual approach, which is its top attribute.",1465430400,,997,5.180124223602484

BTW, the ant special effects are terrible; big hairy ants. The idea of atomic bomb mutations has been done to death, but this movie was still early for that theme.

  - Unnatural Things Alive or Dead""

If that list of shady goings-on doesn't whet your appetite for this movie, then I don't know what to tell ya. Them! - out in 1954 - was the forerunner and the granddaddy of the giant insect films of the 1950s. Them! tracks father-and-daughter bug experts Edmund Gwenn and Joan Weldon, state trooper James Whitmore, and FBI agent James Arness as they hunt down colonies of rampaging mutated ants from New Mexico to Los Angeles. It begins with an unsettling scene, with New Mexico state troopers coming across a traumatized 5- or 6-year-old girl wandering the desert. Soon after, they find an inexplicably caved-in trailer home absent of its occupants. I love the ominous tone established in those scenes. The first half of the movie moves like an eerie detective story. The second half opens it up as a full-on monster movie as America's military might converges in the L.A. sewer tunnels to take out the surviving queen ants and their soldiers.

There is taut execution to Them! There's a sense of dread and an apocalyptic vibe pulsating throughout, abetted by a tremendous score and by black-and-white cinematography that lends a greater sense of atmosphere than if the movie had been in color. The acting is aces. A movie like this could've played for laughs, but, gratifyingly, the cast and crew take it seriously. Oh, there are brief moments of levity but they serve as offsetting grace notes from the tension sustained on the screen. Our protagonists are professionals in their field who do their jobs the best they can, and it's exactly how we hope front line folks like these would behave in real life should crazy sh-- go down. The special effects are apropos of its era, so, no, they don't hold up to today's standards. There's a lot of smoke and mirrors going on. What's effective is how the mutant creatures are staged. As they say, it's all in the presentation. The first time we see a behemoth ant, it's a hell of a memorable scene. Edmund Gwenn's character heightens the foreboding mood by dropping several sinister remarks: ""We may be witnesses to a biblical prophecy come true""; ""Ants are the only creatures on Earth - other than man - who make war."" Them! is one of the first in sci-fi cinema to extend a cautionary message about man's hubris and the perils of nuclear testing. It presents a terrifying vision of nature gone amok. And as a long-time Los Angelino, it freaks me out that there are 700 miles of spooky storm drains worming their way 'neath my city. Because what else is down there? Well-groomed mutant Chihuahuas?",1461024000,,2900,4.783132530120482

289290,1,6300269477,"Great Movie! Very bad Blu-Ray. This review is not for the movie itself, which stands out among the 1950's B Sci-Fi/Horror flicks, as a top notch film. No this is for the Blu-Ray disc which is terrible. Firstly, if you have this film on DVD, and were thinking of upgrading; In a word...DON'T! Where do I begin? First the transfer is very grainy in many places, and is almost unwatchable. Second, the original aspect ratio of this film was 4:3. This disc is in widescreen. To accomplish this, they chopped off portions of the top and bottom of the original picture, to make a ""Widescreen"" presentation. I mad a side-by-side comparison to see what was cut. Now sometimes what is cut is not very important, however in some cases it IS important. For instance; When Dr. Pat Medford is examining a ""Foot-Print"" in the desert and hears the strange whistling noises of ""Them"", in the original you slowly see the emergence of ""Them"" at the top of the screen. Now due to the cut, their ""Emergence"" is delayed slightly, and you view of the doctor is cut. Third, the film is very dark. This darkness, coupled with the graininess of the transfer, almost makes watching it impossible. And lastly, the sound is not good. I had to turn up the volume on both my TV and sound-bar almost to full before the dialog was audible, but the music and sound effects were very loud. If you are lucky enough to have this ""Classic Sci-Fi"" movie on DVD. Consider yourself lucky and DO NOT buy this stinking piece of mildewing trash. THEM! is a classic of 50's Sci-Fi genre; It deserved better than this.",1459900800,28,1573,4.561837455830389

289358,1,6300269477,"This review relates specifically to the Blu-ray version of the film WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT BUY.

The film ""Them"" is a classic 1950s science fiction film. The FX are typical of 50s films of this genre and are adequate, if unconvincing by modern standards, but that's perfectly OK. The script, acting, cinematography and direction overall are very good, and it is a satisfying and enjoyable movie worth 5/5 stars in the context of other 1950s films.

However the recent Warner Blu-ray release is a travesty. This film was originally released in 4:3 aspect in theaters but for some reason Warners decided to use a cropped version of the film for the blu-ray release, perhaps so that idiots who don't understand the reason for the black bars at the sides of 4:3 aspect films on a widescreen don't fell annoyed that the whole screen isn't being used. Even worse, it is not a cropped version taken from the original film stock, it is just a zoomed copy of the earlier 4:3 aspect digital transfer done for the DVD release.  Consequently it is not crisp.

DO NOT BUY THIS BLU-RAY. Instead buy the earlier Warner DVD which is superior in every way and is still available as of January 2016. If you already have the DVD and were considering upgrading to the blu-ray (which is my situation) then don't do it.",1454025600,12,1295,4.641921397379913

289376,1,6300269477,"I love this movie, but held off picking it up because of the differing opinions about the blu ray quality. Finally watched it with a friend and we both agree that this version is in NO WAY a true widescreen. It is just zoomed in (not cropped, like others say) to fill a widescreen tv. All one has to do is watch the WB logo at the beginning and you can see it is pushed to the edges. That is not a part of the film that ANY cinematographer would decide, no matter fullscreen or any various widescreen aspect, it is a company logo that will always be the same framing.
You don't lose much screen image, but man, this makes the movie look crappy. Way too much noise in any bright background and comparing a paused scene in the lair (with the dead ants and larvae),the blu ray side by side with the dvd, the blu ray background was actually blurry. The dvd looked great and that was playing on a dvd player, not upscaling on a blu ray player.
If any of this makes sense to you, stay away from the blu ray version. I would love to see this in it's real intended widescreen. This is not it.

The script is sharp. Great to watch with your kids and explain, ""This is what we got before there was Pixar, George Lucas, digital effects."" James Whitmore is terrific... (I was thinking how cool it could be to go back in time and say, ""Y'know, Jim...20 years from now, you will OWN broadway with your portrayal of Harry Truman...and in another 40 years, you'll STILL be doing unforgettable work in a film called ""Shawshank Redemption.'"" The talent, likability and staying power of some actors is mind-blowing.) It's said Walt Disney watched this movie to see if James Arness would work out as DAVY CROCKETT he was developing for his TV show, ""Disneyland.""  Arness didn't make the grade -- but FESS PARKER's brief appearance DID! Disney cast ""the crazy Texas pilot"" from THEM! landed him the role and Davy Crockett would go on to be a sensation with Disney actually re-releasing the 3-part TV show into a theatrical movie. Parker would go on as DANIEL BOONE on NBC for a half-dozen years.

Imagine my disappointment when I start watching and immediately see that this movie was cropped into the 1.85:1 HD format. It ruined my enjoyment of the movie that I grew-up loving in its original 4:3 theatrical release format.

Why would WB do this? If I wanted to fill my screen I could have simply hit the zoom button on the TV. But the way it is, much of the original framing is altered and cannot be fixed on my end. A secondary issue with this cropping is that the image is softer and film grain is more pronounced since the presentation is effectively zoomed-in about 40%. I urge the studios NOT to do this to movie classics. They should be presented in their original format.

If you are okay with this presentation, go ahead and purchase the Blu-ray but hang on to your old 4:3 DVD copy as I surely will. Other than the above serious defect, the transfer is almost perfect with no quality issues.",1447286400,4,1170,4.407407407407407

MAN has split the atom and ushered in a new era. But how could he know he would also create THEM? This landmark movie about giant radiation-mutated ants boasts remarkable, OSCAR nominated special effects. THEM! Begins in New Mexico with a child wandering in shock, a ransacked general store and a battered corpse full of enough formic acid to kill 20 men. It ends with an epic struggle in the 700 miles of storm drains under Los Angeles, where the insect hordes are beaten, though they spawned a generation of films about radioactive creatures. Some approximate the terror, but few have equated the artistry of THEM!

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: Academy Awards: Nominated: Special Effects. Golden Reel Award: Win: Best Sound Editing. Leonard Nimoy has a small, uncredited part as a U.S. Army Staff Sergeant in the communications room. Other actors who appear in small parts include John Beradino, Willis Bouchey, Booth Colman, Richard Deacon, Lawrence Dobkin, Ann Doran, William Schallert, Douglas Spencer, Dub Taylor and Harry Wilson. When THEM! began production in the fall of 1953, it was originally conceived to be in 3-D and Warner Color. During pre-production, tests were to be shot in colour and 3D. A few colour tests were shot of the large-scale ant models, but when it was time to shoot the 3D test, Warner Bros' ""All Media"" 3D camera rig malfunctioned and no footage could be filmed.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In one of the most intriguing openings in science fiction cinema, where we find two New Mexico State Police troopers Sergeant Ben Peterson [James Whitmore] and Trooper Ed Blackburn [Chris Drake] discover a little girl in shock, wandering across the desert near Alamogordo, New Mexico who were doing their highway patrol duty, who take little girl to safety. Nearby, they discover a trailer home that has been partially demolished by some unknown force and inside there is evidence of a bloody struggle. Later, when one of the police officers is gathering evidence at another site of destruction of a ransacked country store, we he hear lots of very strange, high pitched sound coming closer and closer until he's confronted with the horrifying source and the last thing he will ever see. Meanwhile, doctors try to jolt the little girl out of her catatonic state, finally succeeding with a formic acid sample, similar to traces found at the crime scene. The child becomes wildly agitated upon smelling the odour, screaming, ""THEM! it is THEM!,"" hence the title of the film which means GIANT ANTS!

A precursor to all the giant insect horror films of the fifties, THEM! [1954] was released during the Cold War era and was also one of the first science fiction thrillers to issue a warning about the dangers of nuclear testing and radioactivity in the aftermath of the atomic bomb's creation. The film is truly unique in its conception and the first half is constructed like a detective thriller, the second half works as a fantasy adventure with the army and FBI agents invading the storm drains beneath Los Angeles where they hope to locate and destroy the queen ant's nest. THEM! also has a welcome sense of humour that sometimes emerges during unexpected but appropriate moments, such as the sequence with the airline pilot Alan Crotty [Fess Parker] who is being held for observation at a Brownsville, Texas, mental institution and no one believes his eyewitness account of the mutant ants. But if anyone deserves the screen credit for the film's success, it was Ted Sherdeman, a former staff producer at Warner Bros. who was instrumental in developing the project. First, he commissioned the original story from George Worthing Yates, which appeared as a diary account about giant ants nesting in the New York subway.

But at the start of the film, we find after several people in the New Mexico desert wind up missing or presumed dead, including an FBI agent and most of his family, police Sergeant Ben Peterson [James Whitmore] teams up with FBI Agent Robert Graham [James Arness] to find out whats causing the strange occurrences. They find send a strange print found at one of the crime scenes and it is sent to the Department of Agriculture. Doctor Harold Medford [Edmund Gwenn] and his daughter Doctor Patricia Medford [Joan Weldon] arrive and ask to be taken to the scene of some of the disappearances. When they get there they are shocked to find gigantic ants, whose mutations were caused by the first atomic bomb explosion nine years earlier. They manage to destroy the nest of ants, but not before two winged queen ants and a couple of drones have hatched and escaped the nest. Now it is a race against time to find the two queen ants before they can establish more nests and hatch more queens.

The best parts of the film are near the beginning and the mystery of unexplained deaths in the desert is well done, and a subplot involving a little girl terrified by the smell of formic acid is very vivid, and near the end and the famous sewer scenes, searching for the ants new nest. But there good moments throughout, especially the evidence given by a supposedly insane aircraft pilot Alan Crotty [Fess Parker] and a babbling Jensen [Olin Howland] the alcoholic, both of whom have seen the ants in action.

THEM! as I have originally informed you that originally been conceived as a 3D feature in colour and the giant ants were given a purplish shade of green; their eyes were a soapy looking mixture of reds and blues that changed shades constantly and made them appear to be alive. Unfortunately, these effects were lost when Warner Brothers decided to release the film in black and white without the 3D effect to save costs. Nevertheless, the film still proved to be enormously successful when released, becoming one of the studio's top grossing films of the year and even receiving favourable reviews from critics who usually dismissed horror and sci-fi films. The New York Times review proclaimed THEM! ""one ominous view of a terrifyingly new world"" and that ""it is definitely a chiller....fascinating to watch."" Jack Warner remained unconvinced, however, and told his staff after a screening, ""Anyone who wants to make any more ant pictures will go to Republic!"" Obviously, the studio mogul was a poor judge of science fiction films for THEM! is among the best, a cautionary tale about the dangers of the atom bomb and a frightening view of nature run amok.

One of the reasons THEM! succeeds so well is the amount of suspense that is built up before the ants appear on screen, which isn't until a half hour into the film. If you watched the movie without seeing the poster or knowing anything about it first, it would definitely add to the mystery. We hear them a few times before we actually see them in their full glorious appearance and the high pitched, pulsating, echoing sounds they make are truly creepy. It's the perfect build up! By far I think the most impressive performance in this film is by the little Ellinson girl [Sandy Descher], although everyone else is just as good and there's an amusing scene involving Dr. Harold Medford [Edmund Gwenn] trying to communicate via radio headphones.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video has at last brought out the classic sci-fi horror film THEM! that I originally had on the inferior DVD format. THEM! is a massive pleasant wonderful surprise and for the now for the first time it looks so beautifully clean in the Black-and-White 1080p encoded images and is a joy to view and is now brought to you in a brand new transfer. In the cinema it was brought out in the 1.75:1 Original Aspect Ratio, but now Warner Home Video has decided to release it in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio and despite the slight difference it still looks like a brilliant presentation. At at the start of the film it looks very grainy and I think that this was done on purpose, but as the film progresses the Black-and-White images get very clear and crisp. So all in all this is a brilliant presentation of one of my all-time favourite horror sci-fi films where creatures are out to destroy the world and also try and have world domination.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video has given us the original produced RCA Sound System of 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono sound track, that audiences got to hear in 1954. The dialogue is very clear, as are when the giant ants gets very vocal with their high pitched, pulsating, echoing sounds that are truly creepy. What is equally impressive is the very atmospheric exciting music composed by Polish composer Bronislau Kaper who really brings lots of tension to the film to make you wonder what nasty things are going to happen to everyone looking out for the giant ants and also trying to fend them off, which to mind makes watching this Blu-ray even more exciting and also brings back so many wonderful happy memories when I first viewed this film in the cinema and you will not be at all disappointed and will keep you on the edge of your seat in not knowing what is going to happen next to the people who are out to destroy the giant ants.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Ants [2002] [1080p] [1.33:1] [3:04] Here we get to view Behind-The-Scenes archive footage montage on the Design and Operation of the Giant Ants. When you click on this Ants extra, you get to view this sort of mock up colourful magazine style cover with the title wording THEM! and informs you that SELECT OUTTAKES! WHAT YOU DONT KNOW COULD KILL YOU! Plus you also informed that you should check out EXTRA! See & Hear What They Have Kept From You About THEM! as well as You Cant Afford To Miss THIS!!! Details Inside! But then suddenly you get another similar mock up magazine page entitled GRUESOME FOOTAGE giving you loads of detail with very enticing in-depth information about what you are about to witness, especially what gruesome images you will get to view, but throughout the just over 3 minutes of footage, you get lots of sound effects of the giant ants and some weird atmospheric type of music in the background. But what you actually get to view is lots of test shots from the film THEM! But at the start of each separate test shots you get this single frame shot of a cassette tape, with different wording with each corresponding test shot you are about to view, and the first example has the wording Douglas # 805; SC No. 181; Take N and Hickox # 17 that I suppose was used to record the sound, and of course with each test shot the wording keeps changing on the cassette tape, anyway you will understand when you personally view this extra. But as you go through the different test shots, most of the time you see the giant ants in action and sometimes you get to see the hidden mechanical parts that made the giant ants work. But again while you watch all these test shots you get to hear the sound effects of the giant ants, but you also get the sound of the helicopter that appears in a couple of shots hovering over the giant ants nest. But in one of the test shots you actual see the guys behind-the-scenes who worked the giant ants. But despite this being a very short extra it was still interesting to view, but what a shame there was no recorded video interviews with anyone who was involved with the film.

Theatrical Trailer [1954] [1080p] [1.33:1] [3:18] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for THEM! But for some unknown reason we get to view it in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio? But despite this, it is really great to see this included, especially showing us what audiences viewed in 1954 in giving us its full scale scary terrifying dramatic presentation we will witness in the actual film.

Finally, one of the reasons the sci-fi horror film THEM! succeeds so well and has the right amount of suspense that is built up before the giant ants appear on screen, which isn't until about half hour into the film. If you watched the film without seeing the poster or knowing anything about the film, it definitely add to the mystery. What I love also about this film is when we hear THEM! a few times before we actually get to witness THEM! especially with the high pitched, pulsating, echoing sounds they make are truly creepy and it's the perfect build up! But equally what I also love about this film is the little orphan girl wandering around in total shock, the inhospitable windy environment, the creepy dark passageways, the creatures that emit a deadly acid and not to mention the egg laying of the queen ants, as well as the scene where the crew finds hatched eggs in one of the giant ant farm chambers. Plus, there is something about seeing this sci-fi horror film in Black-and-White that really adds to the creepy atmospheric factor. The cinematography of the desert scenes is very impressive. However, for a creepy and crawly good time, you can't beat THEM! and those prophetic last words as spoken by Dr. Harold Medford in the film's final scene will haunt you long after the screen fades to black. So all in all I am so excited to have this in my ever increasing Sci-Fi Horror Films Blu-ray Collection and well worth purchasing, as I know you will have a totally enjoyable 92 minutes of sheer terror enjoyment. Highly Recommended!

On Blu Ray, it's also brilliantly remastered. Basically it's a simple tale of fear. The Nuclear tests in 1945 have led normal ants to grow to gigantic size. So what makes this so great? They aren't fire breathing, talking, thinking, indestructible ants, they're just ants, doing ant things, only their 9 feet long. James Whitmore, James Arness, Joan Weldon and more make this film so damn enjoyable. Even though I now have it on Blu Ray, if it's on TV, I'll just stop and watch it.

The very thought makes me desperate for a nap. I highly recommend watching this film only in the daytime with friends and family or alone in the middle of the night. It is too terrifying otherwise.

Them! Them!"". For all observers, including the audience, the visceral terror was palpable, and quite frankly unforgettable.

289579,5,6300269477,"A classic 1950s sci-fi movie with great production values for the era, crisp and sharp B&W, and excellent cast all-round of actors who were or became famous in their own rights. Highly recommended as one of the top 50s science fiction movies.  Them! is one of the first of the 1950s ""nuclear monster"" movies, and the first ""big bug"" feature. A nest of gigantic irradiated ants is discovered in the New Mexico desert; they quickly become a national threat when it is discovered a young queen ant and her consorts have escaped to establish a new nest. The national search that follows finally culminates in a battle with Them in the concrete spillways and sewers of Los Angeles.

Them! is one of the movies that made me love fifties Sci-Fi. With it's intelligent script creates a refreshingly suspenseful story of mutation due to nuclear radiation. In my opinion the special effects hold their own even after all these years. Yes obviously they are not on par with today's CG movie effects that we have come to enjoy but never the less for that time, they are brilliant. Love the small town atmosphere which everyone knows each other. The intelligent plot and the wonderful cast delivering 100% makes this movie a must for Sci-Fi fan

I especially appreciate the fact that the woman PhD in the story is treated in a most respectful manner by her father, another PhD. Very unusual for the 1950s, when sexism in movies (and elsewhere) was, sadly, the norm.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengoolie is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better :Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOLER ALERT
New Mexico State Police troopers Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) and Ed Blackburn (Chris Drake) discover a little girl in shock, wandering the desert near Alamogordo, New Mexico. They retrace her steps to a mobile home owned by an FBI agent named Ellinson, who was on vacation in the area with his family. The side of the trailer was ripped open from the outside, the rest of the family is missing and no money was taken. A single unidentifiable animal track seems to be the only clue. Then a strange, pulsating high-pitched noise echos out of the desert on the wind. The little girl briefly reacts in fear when she hears the sound, but this is not noticed by those around her.

A general store owner named ""Gramps"" Johnson is found dead; his store is also torn apart from the outside. No cash was taken, but a barrel of sugar was smashed open. Gramps' Winchester rifle was fired and is now twisted out of shape. Peterson leaves by car to check on the little girl and make a report, leaving Blackburn to guard the store. Blackburn hears the strange, pulsating sound outside and leaves to investigate; off-camera gunshots are fired, the strange sound grows faster and louder, and Blackburn's scream is heard.

A plaster cast of the odd footprint found near the trailer is sent to Washington, D.C. Peterson's boss later points out that Gramps had time to fire all his ammunition at his attacker, and Peterson's missing partner was a ""crack shot"", eliminating the possibility of a homicidal maniac. Even more puzzling is the coroner's determination of Johnson's cause of death: a broken neck and back, skull fracture, crushed abdomen, and ""enough formic acid in his body to kill 20 men"".

The FBI sends Agent Robert Graham (James Arness) to investigate after the Bureau is unable to identify the footprint. With him he brings Drs. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn) and his daughter Pat Medford (Joan Weldon), both myrmecologists from the Department of Agriculture. The elder Medford examines the footprint. He later exposes the Ellinson girl to formic acid fumes, which revives her from a catatonic state; she screams, ""Them! Them!""

Though his suspicions are validated by the girl's reaction, Medford will not reveal his theory; doing so prematurely might lead ""to a nationwide panic"". While investigating the Ellinson campsite, Pat screams when she encounters a giant, eight-foot long foraging ant. The lawmen run to her aid and empty their pistols into the insect with little effect. On directions from the elder Medford, Peterson and Graham destroy the ant's antennae, blinding it; they then kill it with sustained fire from a Thompson submachine gun. Harold finally reveals his theory: a colony of giant ants, mutated by radiation from the first atomic bomb test near Alamogordo, is responsible for the killings.

A helicopter search conducted by the Medfords, Peterson, Graham, and Major Kibby, on orders from General O'Brien, discovers the ants' nest. Cyanide gas bombs are tossed into it, and Graham, Peterson, and Pat descend into the nest to kill any survivors. Deep inside, Pat finds evidence that two queen ants have hatched and have escaped to establish new colonies. To avoid a general panic, the elder Medford gives a government task force a briefing on ants, as the government covertly investigates all reports of any unusual activity, even sightings of ""flying saucers"".

The first report comes from south Texas where a private pilot (Fess Parker) has been committed to a mental hospital after claiming that his aircraft was forced down by UFOs, shaped like giant ants. Next, the Coast Guard receives a report of a giant queen hatching her brood in the hold of a freighter at sea in the Pacific; giant ants attack the ship's crew and there are few survivors. The freighter is later sunk by U. S. Navy gunfire, eliminating one of the queens.

A third report comes in that leads Peterson, Graham, and Major Kibby to a rail yard in Los Angeles where a smashed boxcar has been emptied of 40 tons of sugar. An alcoholic in a hospital ""drunk tank"" claims to have seen giant ants outside his window. The mutilated body of a father is recovered, but his two young sons with him are missing. Peterson, Graham, and Kibby find evidence that the dad and kids were flying a model aircraft in the Los Angeles River drainage channel near the hospital. Given the apparent convergence of sightings, the President of the United States declares martial law in Los Angeles; more troops are assigned to find the new nest in the vast storm drain network under the city.

Peterson finds the two missing boys alive deep inside the drain system, but they are trapped near the ants' nest. He calls for reinforcements and goes in alone to rescue them, getting both boys to safety just before he is attacked by a giant ant. Graham arrives with reinforcements and kills the ant attacking Peterson, as others swarm to protect the nest. Peterson dies from his injuries. Graham and the other soldiers fight off the ants, but a tunnel collapse isolates Graham. Several ants charge him, but he is able to hold them off with his machine gun just long enough for the other troops to break through and make the rescue. The queen and her young hatchlings are discovered and destroyed with flame throwers.

Afterward, Dr. Medford makes a philosophic observation: ""When Man entered the Atomic Age, he opened the door to a new world. What we may eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict.""",1431907200,,7377,4.835182250396197

'Them!' features stalwart, resourceful 1950's American men facing up to The Unknown Menace and protecting the children and the womenfolk. Like all the 1950's SF films, it captures, almost accidentally, the America of the time-- clothes, cars and manners. That America is a very nice place to spend a couple of hours in. Even with giant ants running around.

No need to recap the plot once again here. Suffice that the acting is surprisingly good (James Whitmore has pure star quality and charisma even at this early stage in his career) and the script and editing are both tight.

Just a great film. See it by all means, and it's well worth owning. Them! is on par with War Of The Worlds, Body Snatchers, Day The Earth Stood Still and the other greats of the era.

It had everything, mystery, a great cast of at the time little known actors-including James Arness, James Whitmore, Fess Parker (Disney's Davy Crockett)  and even Lenard Nemoi from Star Trek ( see if you can see him. While I hate bugs this was the best the 50's could do for special effects and then they worked really well. Now we might thing them clumsy and fake. But in the 50's it was a big deal when a plane flew over the farm as we pointed with open mouths. ""Must be going a 100!""

Anyway while the radiation factor is completely bogus that is because we were in the early years of the atomic world.  The mystery starts immediately, in a the far off western US desert, with a policeman vanishing off right off with an odd but distinctive whirling sound as small ants gobble up sugar on the floor of a crime scene.

Then enters the FBI (James Arness) after Whitmore finds a little girl wandering in the desert. Experts are called in with Edmond Gwenn and his babe daughter/scientific assistant. The foundling cannot speak until she is given a whiff of formic acid and starts screaming ""THEM!"" So out they go into the desert to search for the cause of disappearances. The cause becomes obvious as they are attacked by ""THEM!"". Thank God Arness and Whitmore brought some Thompson machine guns. With this scene the culprits are made know.

The picture is perfection: no visible grain or DVD noise, perfect contrast and good sound. Warner Bros. should use whoever did this transfer on everything. Maybe they do because all their more current releases are very good along with Columbia and Paramount. Maybe this is because these three are still using Technicolor while all the rest use some form of Eastmancolor (Deluxe, Metrocolor, Pathe etc.) I saw this here in Phoenix in 1954. The opening title scene with all the credits was in color until the scene change then it went to B&W. This may be why Warners chose to electronically color the word THEM red and blue on this DVD. Judging by the way the scenes are composed with a lot of different planes of depth I believe THEM was filmed in 3-D but not released in 3-D. WB did that to DIAL M FOR MURDER in 1954 also. My vote for best color transfer goes to Fox's 1945 LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN. The opening scenes in the train observation car with Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews are beautiful. Those closeups of Tierney will knock you out with those bright green eyes. You can still get this one inexpensively on Amazon. Can't say that about THEM! OOPS!

Having owned this on VHS for years, I wanted to replace it with a digital copy. DVD prices seemed high so I decided, against my better judgement and intuition,  to try the ""Amazon Instant Video"". As I suspected, it was a major disappointment. I was unable to download it to my PC (Amazon advertises they are downloadable to other devices, touting that you can ""save it"" to your hard drive, but when I tried, this one apparently only is downloadable to a Kindle, so out of luck there). The movie player often has trouble connecting but my internet connection seems fine with everything else. Finally, in the middle of the movie, the screen went to a mish-mosh of colors and just froze - unusable.

Like ""The Cloud"", this is just another hoax - another way for large corporations to control your data. The reasons they give for this technology being positive are the exact reasons it isn't. What happens when ""they"" decide you shouldn't have access anymore, or they need some information that now conveniently sits on ""the cloud""? There is nothing wrong with having things on your hard drive and backing up files, and even then if you are connected to the internet you have risks.

Wake up people!! Stay away from technology that keeps you data ""out there, somewhere""! Ironically enough...this movie is abount giant ants that mutated and try and take over the world. Hmmmmmm....I think there is a parallel here somewhere.....",1375574400,5,1599,4.720430107526882
290010,5,6300269477,"Released in 1954, 'Them' stands apart from other science fiction films of the early 1950's. Instead of cheap effects and cheesy storylines, it deals with the possible results of above-ground testing of atomic bombs. One such test alters the DNA (although this term is not used in the film) of ant nests in the surrounding area, creating a new generation of giant ants. Once they decide to move their queen into a major city on the West Coast, all hell breaks loose. The acting is genuine, the action nonstop, the script tight, and the special effects solid. James Arness ('Gunsmoke') and James Whitmore ('The Shawshank Redemption') have starring roles. Co-stars include Edmund Gwenn {Kris Kringle from 'Miracle on 34th Street') as a bug scientist with a streak of philosopher in him: ""We may be witnesses to a Biblical prophecy come true..."" and Joan Weldon as his daughter. Also look for Fess Parker ('Davy Crockett') in a smaller role as a private pilot temporarily committed to a mental hospital after he reports seeing one of the giant ants near his plane.

Ah, the classic word uttered by the little girl, ""Them,"" still can send a shiver down my old hardened spine. Many people feel this is the ultimate giant monster movie of the 50's, with the possible exception of ""Godzilla."" I find it right up there with the greats, though a little worse for wear.

People are disappearing in the desert of New Mexico. Buildings being destroyed, or heavily damaged, & a very strange occurrence, a grocery store gets hit, & other than the owners, the only other thing that is missing? Sugar! Here we have another great paranoid nuclear/communist 50's allegory committed to celluloid, as mutated giant 15 foot black ants are discovered in the desert, & they have an agenda, populate, divide, & conquer!

Filled with ample amounts of dread, just like the scene with the little girl, ""Them,"" delivers it's atmospheric paranoia in spades. Especially potent is the sleigh bell sounds the ants make. The beginning of the movie uses this to full effect, as you hear the sound, but don't have a clue to what it is yet. All you know is something bad is going to happen. Director, Gordon Douglas, & makes a fine, even frightening film for it's time! Unfortunately, it does not hold up in the effects department as well as some of it's 50's sci-fi brethren like, ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,"" or even ""The Deadly Mantis."" Most of this can be contributed to the low budget, & the multitude of sheer number of the Ants. I mean, you can spend more money on one monster, than several, right? Even so, for it's time, the Ants were menacing to this young boy, & a whole generation who grew up in the 50's & 60's, before special effects became a perfected art. At the same time, younger people who are used to special effects from the 80's to today, will probably not embrace this film, for it's menacing Ants look silly today as compared to the insects in movies like, ""Starship Troopers,"" & the remake of ""King Kong."" You have to make a jump back in time to really appreciate, ""Them."" That is why I feel this film begs a remake from a fine director.

THEM even holds up well today making allowances for black and white and no computer graphics special effects.

Okay, sure, the ants look like an art project gone bad, all rubbery with antenna that look like pipe cleaners.  But for its time, that was state of the art!  (The movie was nominated for a special effects Oscar, losing out to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.)  What those ants lacked in realism was more than adequately recompensed with a pervading sense of doom: that eerie desert landscape, the fabulous use of sound.  Shot in glorious black and white, THEM is one of the more taut Sci-Fi thrillers of its time.  It moves relentlessly to a final showdown that involves a rescue mission plus the prime directive of destroying all the giant ants.  This movie is also helped immeasurably by the performances of James Whitmore (fraught with a quiet authority few could master), James Arness (snarling as he towered above everyone), Oscar winner Edmund Gwynne (the quintessential scientist), and Fess Parker in a brief but effective role as an eyewitness.  Leonard Nimoy even puts in an appearance as an Air Force sergeant!  And who could forget that little girl wandering like a zombie in the desert.........until the scent of formic acid causes her to scream THEM!

Dr. Medford can say, at the end of the film that atomic bomb testing causes mutation in life forms...Linus Pauling learned so to his cost - he was accused of being an anti-progressive and communist sympathiser...and had to appeal to President Truman for the return of his confiscated passport.

Them is a well acted criticism of the dangers of radiation mutation by atmospheric atomic bomb testing. The desert scene where the four main characters; the Drs. Medford (Edmund Gwenn, Joan Weldon)FBI agent Robert Graham (James Arness)and Police Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) first encounter the giant ants is loaded with 1950s concerns.  The public's bewilderment by science, fear of atomic radiation mutilation and apocalyptic destruction all come up in this scene. Graham is irritated by  Pat Meford's use of the word ""myrmecologist""...""why don't we all speak English, then we'd have some basis for understanding!"" Harold Medford tells the others that the huge ant the have just destroyed by gunfire was the result of radiation for the first atomic bomb test and ends with the Biblical prophesy that the ""beasts shall reign over the earth"" and the human race faces extinction. The ants are destroyed at the end of the film but concerns about the atomic age persist.

It's the bit parts that give this film a ring of true, while it's good seeing Leonard Nimoy in his pre-Spock days as the army sargeant, Fess Parker as the stressed out Alan Crotty (the parth that brought him to the attention of Walt Disney) in the ""loony bin..nut house"" for seeing giant flying ants is the part I liked most.",1297728000,,1764,5.027397260273973

After the military is called in to destroy the nest, the queen escapes, and a new colony pops up beneath the city streets of Los Angeles! Gordon Douglas' 1954 film is a landmark in Science Fiction cinema, unofficially kicking off the nuclear era along with THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and Japan's GOJIRA. Giant bugs would run rampant on theater screens all across America as a result, with THEM! quickly being followed by TARANTULA, THE DEADLY MANTIS, EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, and others. Outside of simply being the first of its kind, THEM! is also recognized for its Oscar-nominated special effects, the surprising amount of physical violence that occurs on-screen, its impressive set designs, as well as a number of key performances by James Whitmore, James Arness, Edmund Gwenn, and Fess Parker. From Cold War fears to larger-than-life insects, THEM! is a frighteningly entertaining entry in the Giant Monster genre.

Her blank stare and inability to speak indicates shock, which is justified when her trailer home miles up the road is found literally torn open from one side. The general store close by is in a similar condition, with the owner's lifeless body found in the basement and his 30-30 rifle barrel bent backwards. At both crime scenes, the money was left behind, ruling out robbery. However, both damaged properties had spilled over sugar... a psychotic killer in a hijacked tank with a sweet tooth, perhaps? Try oversized mutant ants in said condition as a result of early atomic bomb testing in the area years ago!

A pre-Gunsmoke James Arness and others concur and the battle between the only two species on earth that wage war begins.

It's certainly understandable that this is considered the best of the ""big bug"" films in the 50s by many. Being the forerunner to the subgenre that would later give us giant spiders, wasps, scorpions, praying mantis and grasshoppers certainly helps its pedestal placement. Yet, Them! wouldn't have maintained respect through the years without its intelligent script (with dialogue mainly between doctors, the military and law enforcement on how to combat the giant ants) and an A-movie treatment from Warner Bros. (although the budget was cut prior to shooting, thus eliminating the proposed usage of color film and 3-D special effects). Lest we forget the eerie squeaking and chirping sounds heard as a forewarning of oncoming six-legged monsters, which manages to set a chilling tone to compensate for the somewhat minimal screentime of the ""ant""agonists (all of which were man made and ""in the flesh""; no stop motion animation or usage of actual ants superimposed on the film).

But James Whitmore's tough police sergeant with a heart breathes life into this film. He impressed me when I first saw ""Them!"" as a kid, and years later as a reporter I took advantage of a backstage interview with Whitmore to say how much I enjoy that movie (as well as 2 other B-thrillers from that era in which he starred: ""Face of Fire"" and the uniquely imaginative ""The Next Voice You Hear""). I recently bought the DVD after telling my 8-year-old grandson enough about the film to stimulate his interest. Like I said, the giant ants are big enough to indicate a pending threat (which is enhanced early in the film by action occuring within hearing but out of sight offscreen)but not nearly so lifelike as to trigger nightmares for young viewers. And a very young Fess Parker has a small but key bit years before becoming the coonskin-cap hero of kids around the world as Davy Crockett. James Arness is there in his pre-Matt Dillion personna in a much bigger--but not as fun--part than he had in ""The Thing From Another World."" Edmund Gwenn, always a delight to watch, is good as the bumbling scientist called in on the case.

""Them!"" may not be great art, but it's a fun, entertaining film that provides an interesting peek into the society and mind-set of the 1950s. And it may be prophetic--the afternoon after we first saw this movie as children, my brother, cousin, and I began noticing that the ants in my grandma's back yard seemed to be growing bigger!!!",1279152000,2,1656,4.651877133105802

290419,5,6300269477,"A New Mexico police car speeds down the narrow road of white sand.  The two policemen intently scan the expanse of sand, sage brush, and yucca trees; there has been a report of a lost little girl somewhere in this hot desert.  A spotter overhead in a helicopter sees her; the police car rushes to her rescue.

The girl, perhaps only 5, is wearing a plaid, flannel robe and is clutching her security doll, its head broken.  Her blank eyes stare past them; she's in shock.  An ambulance arrives, but before it can take her to the hospital, an eerie high-pitched trill reaches their ears; the girl's eyes stretch wide in fear.

The two policemen head off down the road to find the trailer spotted by the chopper.  The trailer and station wagon look normal, but then they find the other side of the trailer looks like a plastic garbage bag that has been ripped open by a foraging raccoon.  The inside: a mess.  Bloody clothes and a gun speak violence.  Outside, there is an odd footprint and sugar cubes are strewn about.  Solving this mystery is going to be no picnic.

On a special note: the actor Fess Parker, of Davy Crockett fame, has just passed away.  He has a small part in this movie as a pilot who reports seeing flying saucers.

Extras: 'Who's Who!' - a list of characters and actors;
'Bugged at the Movies' - brief paragraphs about a few other creature movies;

290420,5,6300269477,"Of all the B-horror films of the 1950's, ""Them!"" stands out as the most dramatic.  Big stars, and soon-to-be big stars scatter the landscape.

At first you think you're part of a murder mystery of sorts.  Two policemen, one played by James Whitmore (quite a great star here) as Ben, and a plane above, clearly marked New Mexico State Police, are doing a search of the desert.  They find a little girl who can't speak, and who seems to be in shock.  She carries a broken doll.

Further searching finds a destroyed trailer.  Ben figures that there must be some kind of murder here.  They find tracks.  They find that the trailer was ripped out.  And they find pieces of broken doll.  (Sad music).

They put the girl into a medical van (driven by uncredited William Schallert) and as they load her in, they hear the mysterious warbling sounds that will scare the crap out of any ten year old who watches this movie.  ""Must be the wind.""  Yeah, sure.

Ben and his partner drop off at a general store where the report of a missing girl was first placed (apparently).  They find it ripped out just like the trailer.  A busted shotgun is mute testimony that something unholy lurked here.  A dead body filled with formic acid (as you kids know, is also the acid secreted by ants!).

Ben leaves his partner to go drive away in his police car and report evidence.  His partner, alone, hears that warbling sound again.  The  photography here is great.  The shadows, the man, the silence ** screams, gunshots **  silence.  Except for the warbling.

A lot of this movie is drama more than scary stuff.  A lot of talking goes on to clearly explain to the viewer exactly what's going on, why the ants are dangerous and what's being done about it.

Yes, we have the usual daughter of the professor who happens to have brains and is gorgeous.  Imagine that in 1954!

They team up with Ben and Robert (playing a tough guy FBI agent, James Arness of Gunsmoke fame).

They find the nest, but it's too late.  Queens have flown the coop.  And they could be nesting anywhere!

Panic in New Mexico:

Usually in movies like this, the female professor gets the hots for the hero and she is saved from the manly man.  No, not this time.  Sure, there are heroics, but the suspense-building is done by the scientists and somehow, an absent-minded professor from the Department of Agriculture is running the military.  Bizarre but true.

The professor has a great way of getting their shocked little girl to snap out of it.  They fill a glass of ant juice and let her smell it.  She screams: Them!  Them!  Quite the fright!

Some of the actors are not convincing.  When the girl (Pat) is confronted by one of the ants, she screams OK, but when Arness is pumping it full of bullets, she stands there waiting for her cue rather than cower in fear.  No nuzzling of Arness' shoulder either which was disappointing to miss.

Investigating the Nest:

They find the nest OK, and kill the bugs with cyanide.  Much music and adventure as they comb the caves.

In one hilarious scene, Pat finds that the caves are covered with saliva.

Dr. Patricia 'Pat' Medford: [observing the tunnel walls] Look! Held together with saliva!
Ben Peterson: Yeah! Spit's all that's holding me together right now, too.

Flying to Washington:

This is the most boring part, as we get a film presentation from the professor as to ant's habits and why the eight foot long ones could spell the end of Man.  Oh brother.

A lot of the movie at this point goes incessantly over investigation and searching for the ants.  Fess Parker (Davy Crockett!) plays a brief role as a guy who saw flying ants and is locked up in a psych ward.  He overdoes the southern accent a bit but is fun to watch.

The usual media suppression and marshal law ensue.

Panic in Los Angeles:

After much hullabaloo, we find our way to Los Angeles.  Ants are in the tunnels.  Much drama ensues here too.

The ending is great as Arness is cut off from his men and the ants converge  on him as he runs out of bullets!  He screams and runs.  Now would Matt Dillon scream and run?  I mean, really now!

And James Whitmore plays a great death scene as he saves the lives of children at his own sacrifice.  It's sad.

The bottom line:  Them! is well worth seeing.  It's dramatic overtones and its subtext of the dangers of atomic testing is clear.  It does not get heavy into romance or how goofy the professor and how hot his daughter is (though there is some of that).

The director focusing on how the ants impact our lives with the deaths of others is real and though a bit overacted, is refreshing and unusual for a B-movie horror flick.

Since ""Them!"" helped to inspire other atomic testing nightmares, such as Godzilla, film students especially should study this film.

In fact, it might teach your kids not to burn ants!

A great cast is worth repeating.  Thanks, Warner Bros!

""It's getting pretty late, Doctor."" -- James Arness
""Later than you think."" -- Edmund Gwenn

One of the few bright spots during the decline of quality films in American cinema after the 1940's was the sci-fi genre which developed in the 1950's. At it's best it was both fun and entertaining, as well as thought provoking. Them! does all that and more. A great film for late at night cuddled up with your Baby or a Saturday morning when you're being lazy, it's loads of fun.  Star Trek fans might even get a glimpse of a young Leonard Nimoy at a teletype machine if they look fast enough. Those who grew up watching Daniel Boone will enjoy Fess Parker minus his coonskin cap as a pilot who has seen THEM so is presumed bonkers.

It all begins in White Sands, New Mexico, as cop Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) patrols the unending desert with air support above. They find a young, traumatized girl wandering nowhere, in shock and unable to speak. Following her trail to discover what has transpired, a ravaged trailer and a general store in shambles are just the beginning. Bob Graham (James Arness) is called in from the F.B.I. and when a strange acid is found in a body, both men realize they are in over their heads. What neither can understand is why, once those results are sent to the government, the response is to send two scientists and the Army.

Edmund Gwenn and Joan Weldon are father and daughter, and have a theory they don't want to reveal until they're sure. Bob and Patricia (Weldon) hit it off as that strange and eerie sound in the desert winds is revealed to be a product of atomic testing by man; ants having grown gigantic and mutating until they have no choice but to find the only source of food available--man! They prove hard to destroy, and the heroes must follow escaping queens all over the US, culminating in an exciting battle in the storm drains of Los Angeles with the lives of two frightened children and an anxious mother hanging in the balance.

Ted Sherdeman's screenplay adaptation of George Worthing Yates' story has a message about man's interfering in the natural course of nature while director Gordon Douglas never forgets this is supposed to be fun as well. Just good clean fun for a rainy night. Highly recommended.",1257033600,2,2306,4.614634146341463

They discovers that hordes of mutated ants are the cause, Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn) and his daughter Patrica (Joan Weldon) help them try to solve a solution to get rid of the ant problem before they spread to the world.

A brilliant and thrilling 1954 Sci-fi horror classic that is one of the most cautionary movie tales of all time is one of the best Sci-fi movies around.

290464,5,6300269477,"When this movie was released in Sweden about 45 years ago, it was retitled ""Spindlarna"", which means ""The Spiders"". It still bore this title when it was first shown on TV years later, but recently, it's simply been called ""Them"" (the original English title).

The Spiders?! Why on earth would a horror movie about gigantic ants be called ""The Spiders""??? There's not a single spider in the entire movie!

The retitling was either a joke, or a crude way of hiding the real plot. After all, you're not supposed to know that the monsters are ants, until they SHOW THEMSELVES. I was certainly surprised when I saw ""Them"" the first time. In fact, I was even a little bit irritated. I mean, I had expected large, woolly tarantulas! Besides, I happen to *like* ants. (I hate spiders.) Nuking a bunch of Black Widows would have made my day!

But yes, the movie is surprisingly good for a black-and-white production from 1954 (I didn't even know it was *that* old).

Therefore, I give it five stars.

Besides, ants in California or Arizona are probably nastier than the coy, peaceful garden ants we have in our Swedish rosebushes...

Beware then...of the ants.

1 - A good cast: James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn and James Arness are all pretty famous actors who do a fine job here,; 2 - Good special effects, meaning they still look pretty real even 55 years later; 3 - A pretty intelligent script, certainly far better than its competitors; 4 - None of the standard stupid love interest to take away from the storyline; 5 - Just the right amount of action, and finally, 6 - It keeps your interest all the way through.

Sure, the special effects have long been eclipsed by digital, but the suspense holds up as LA mobilizes to defeat the giant killer ants in a battle of the sewers. The opening scenes are among the best of any era. I don't know how director Douglas got little Sandy Descher to emulate wide-eyed speechless shock, but from that moment on the tension rarely lets up. Then too, her single word eruption in the van may be the single scariest moment and a genuine inspiration on somebody's part.

I guess it takes a big man to defeat big ants and thank goodness James Arness has switched to our side since menacing the North Pole in The Thing (1951). He, Whitmore, and Gwenn  prove to be great pest exteminators though their methods are a little unorthodox, while poor pretty Joan Weldon sort of tags along after the guys in typical 50's style. Note the many nice touches from both the producer and director-- the well-stocked press conference, the army units deploying in the background, the humorous aside from the ugly guy in the hospital.

Along the way, we are treated to a lecture on ants (complete with old film clips) and some dubious science to explain why a colony of ants could grow to 10 feet in size in only ten years.

People start coming up missing and the police are there to investigate.  Shortly after they find bodies and bags of sugar along with an occasional vibrating shrill sound that everyone swears is just the wind.  Soon scientists are brought in to examine tracks they find in the sand and they soon deduct it is ant tracks of a very large scale.  The reason... nuclear fallout of course.(the reason for ever mutation)  Soon a group is formed to invade the nest and exterminate the giant ants.(You will see a trend with my reviews I give the cliff notes synopsis. Why tell you the whole story, then you won't have to watch the movie)

Other then the same ol' reasoning behind the mutation this film is very well done.  In fact it was the largest grossing movie the year it came out.  My twelve year old son loved it so it tells you even with all the video games, MP3, DVDs, CGI and the like this film can still captivate your attention.

Out of all the movies that fall into this genre I have to rank this movie #1.

290568,1,6300269477,"I am very surprised about the many positive reviews here.

Of course: the movie itself is a classic, and should not be missed in any ""best of"" ranking.

But we should rather assess, what the buyer of the product - the DVD - get's for their money. And this is from my point of view extremely disappointing. We are withheld a mere 24 % of the cinema movie - with no explanation or apology at all!

According to IMBD the original cinema film format was 1.75 : 1. This is quite the same as a modern TV-screen with it's 16:9 format.

On the DVD however the film comes in good old 4:3 format. That means, they have cut on each side 12 % of the original picture, leaving us just three quarters of what was shown in the cinemas!

Thus the judgment can only be: one star for Warner Home Video!",1206835200,15,784,4.1655629139072845
290569,5,6300269477,"I remember seeing this movie as a little kid and it scared the devil out of me, especially because it was partially filmed in Victorville, CA and I lived in nearby Palmdale at the time. This movie was a turning point for me as I used to be scared to death of monster movies but after being initially scared, this became one of my all time favorites.

I don't know if they've ever colorized it, but I don't think it needs to be in color and would probably ruin my experience with it. This film should stay black and white. After all, that's part of the charm.

For the technology of the time, the ants are very well done and especially for a little kid, totally believable. No strings, and no puppeteer's hand flashing on camera. The story is classic too, just the way I like my icky bug. The pseudo-chauvinist pig comments are typical for the era and don't detract from the story. In fact, I believe the director didn't want any romance and the actress playing the woman scientist was kind of disappointed there was no substantial love sub-plot.

The plot is typical atomic-mutation-creates-monster-bugs, but it is also one of the first, and surely the best done. The anti-nuke message is clear.

This movie hit home in so many ways, especially because of the Joshua trees. It also hit home because of the scenes in the flood control channels in downtown LA, some of which I used to play in when I was a littler kid living in Lakewood and Playa Del Rey before we moved to Palmdale.

This is the ultimate in great icky bug. Highly recommended.",1206576000,,1542,4.492857142857143
290570,4,6300269477,"The menacing insects in this fine sci-fi from 1954 can't hold a candle to what they would look like with the benefit of today's sophisiticated special effects.  But with a script this tight (thanks to Ted Sherdeman and Russell Hughes), sharp, no-nonsense direction by Gordon Douglas, plenty of atmosphere, and characters this engaging, the old-fashioned look of the terrorizing mutants doesn't matter.

THEM! was based on a story by George Worthing Yates, and made in the apocalyptic mode of the atomic post-war era, when the memory of Hiroshima and the birth of the atomic age was very much to the fore.  THEM! is the best of a group of films made during this period, in which humanity is warned, through the rise of mutant species resulting from atomic radiation, of the dangers lurking behind the door that science has just opened.

THEM! opens in the deserts of New Mexico (not too far from White Sands, where the first atomic test bombs were exploded), as Sergeant Ben Peterson, a state trooper (James Whitmore, in an affecting portrayal of what could have been a stock character) picks up a little girl wandering through the scrub in shock, clutching a doll with a broken head.  She is unable to speak and tell Ben and his partner, Ed Blackburn, who she is or where she came from, but they quickly come upon a trailer where they find the other piece of the doll's head on the floor.  The trailer has been badly damaged and there is no sign of the child's family.  They also find an unidentifiable print in the sand not far from the trailer, and make a cast of it.  When Ben and Ed visit the nearby store of a local old-timer, Gramps Johnson, to find out if he has seen anything unusual, they find the store pulled apart in the same way as the trailer, and Gramps dead at the bottom of his cellar.  Ben leaves Ed at the store to explore further - but when he returns, Ed has also disappeared.

As it turns out, the trailer belongs to an FBI agent on vacation with his family, and, assuming that his and his family's disappearance is a violent crime, the FBI sends agent Bob Graham (James Arness, in the second of his classic sci-fi appearances, only this time he's recognizable) to investigate.  Ben is distraught, as he feels responsible for leaving Ed alone in Gramps's store. As he and Bob are introduced, the coroner comes in with the report on Gramps's body, and tells them that there was ""enough formic acid in him to kill twenty men.""  Nonplussed and with no leads, Bob sends the cast of the strange print off to his FBI office in Washington, in case anyone there can identify it.

Someone does: Dr. Medford, a specialist in myrmicology (the study of ants, the term taken, for the classically-minded out there, from the Greek ""myrmidos"": in Homer's ""Iliad"", Achilles's troops were called the ""Myrmidons"" because out on the field they looked like  a swarm of black ants).  Unable to believe their eyes, Dr. Medford and his daughter, Pat, who has followed her father into his scientific specialty, catch the first plane out to New Mexico to find out whether the print is real or a hoax.

Of course, it's not a hoax, as the doctors Medford, Bob, and Ben quickly find out.  As the four search the desert the same day for more prints, in a rising sandstorm, they meet their first specimen of the new breed of giant ant that has evolved in the desert in the aftermath of the atomic tests.  The team barely escapes from the encounter, and as they do so, the two myrmicologists remind Ben and Bob that ants live in colonies, and that their problems are just beginning.

From then on, the film follows the team as it tries to locate the nests of the giant ants, and discover whether queen ants have hatched from these, flown away, and established new nests in other locations.  The government and the military are brought in, and, with the four main characters spearheading the search and destroy mission, this first-class sci-fi races to its finish in the underground sewer tunnels of Los Angeles.

The crisp pace of the film is due to a terrific script that moves forward with locomotive speed, and that provides its characters with snappy, adult, engaging dialogue.  The scenes inside the ants' nests, where the characters must go in order to find out whether queen ants have hatched and left, are genuinely frightening.  There are also some touching human moments, as the haggard mother of two children trapped inside the tunnels waits outside, her husband already killed by the ants, as Ben battles inside to save the children's lives.

The actors give colorful yet believable performances, not least Edmund Gwenn (Mr. Claus from ""Miracle on 34th Street"") as the eccentric senior Dr. Medford, James Arness as the stalwart Agent Graham, James Whitmore as the gruff yet tender-hearted Sgt. Ben Peterson, and stage actress Joan Weldon as the junior Dr. Medford.  The attractive Weldon was not happy in Hollywood and returned to the stage after this film.  Her height, unusual for the era, makes her a nice match for the rangy, 6'6"" Arness, and they both do a creditable job navigating some 1950s moments surrounding the unusual scenario of a brainy career woman as the romantic interest of a not-that-brainy hero.  Arness to Weldon soon after they meet: ""Look, Miss, um, Dr., er . . .""; Weldon to Arness: ""Well, if the ""doctor"" bothers you, why don't you just call me Pat?"".  In a similar echt-1950s moment, Weldon gets off the plane in southern New Mexico, in the 110-degree heat, in a wool suit, hat, gloves, and high heels - the same outfit she wears later to visit the desert in a sandstorm.  A small cameo by Fess Parker as a Texas pilot who encounters the ants while airborne, and gets sent to a mental institution when he reports it, won Parker the role of Davy Crockett after Walt Disney saw the movie. Also, viewers of a certain age should see if they can identify the actor playing a junior naval officer who appears onscreen only for a few seconds, as he hands a ""top secret report"" to a typist.  This was Arness's second foray into this genre - his first was as the giant blood-drinking vegetable/man in Howard Hawks's original (and far superior to John Carpenter's overblown remake), ""The Thing"".  The future Marshal Matt Dillon is to be congratulated on wandering into not one, but two of the best early science fiction films ever made.

Mention must also go to Bronislau Kapers' eerie, tingly score, with its now famous whistling signature sound for the ants, and the excellent black and white production.  Note the overlay of color, though, faintly visible on the opening titles, the only remnant of the initial efforts to shoot the film in color.  Looking at it today, it is hard to imagine that the clean, black and white look of the film could have been improved upon.

THEM! shows its age in a couple of places, but for the most part holds up wonderfully, and deserves its high rank in the canons of this particular science-fiction genre.",1205971200,3,6963,4.674856674856675
290571,5,6300269477,"This star-studded thriller has a plot that is more complex than that of many modern sci-fi films. What's more, the viewer learns something about ant biology in the process.

The clues build up: The site of former atomic-bomb testing, a building with a big hole turned outwards, with no money stolen but sugar taken,...a never-before-seen footprint nearby,...a mutilated corpse loaded with formic acid, a little girl with missing parents who screams in horror at the scent of formic acid, an unearthly screeching sound in the wind, etc.

The existence of giant, 9-foot ants is confirmed. A huge nest is located, and the giant ants destroyed. Problem solved? Not quite. A new set has already hatched, and the queens have taken wing.

A ""crazy"" pilot spots a giant flying queen ant being chased by two smaller, but still-giant male suitors. One queen and her progeny mess up a battleship. Another makes it to the underground tunnel system of LA.

The tension builds...Will a certain drunken man, who is institutionalized within sight of the tunnel openings, give useful information? Will two missing boys be found alive? Will the remaining giant queen ant be destroyed before her progeny multiply out of control...and threaten the very continued existence of the human race?

Now relax...Scientists tell us that giant insects are impossible because the exoskeleton would have to be too heavy to support them. According to evolutionary theory, insects are the most successful form of macroscopic life on Earth. If giant insects were possible, they would have appeared on our planet a long time ago.",1205625600,5,1594,5.115384615384615
290572,4,6300269477,"I didn't grow up with these Fifties films, so watching this is a completely new experience for me. In some ways, I enjoy this far more than modern monster films. This is most likely due to the genuine wonder and terror that infuses every frame of film. It's important to remember that a film like THEM! was probably groundbreaking for it's time - probably even more so than Cloverfield was to today's audiences. For an older film, the pace is surprisingly brisk. What also surprised me was the treatment of the sole female character in ths film as a Scientist rather than just window dressing.

What's also interesting is just how many assumptions the filmmakers make, are challenged by later films and TV series. That the Government can be trusted to protect its citizens - later challenged by the X-Files. That Scientific now-how can solve anything. There's a sweet naivety to those assumptions.

THEM! marks the first time I've ever watched a Fifties Sci-Fi film from beginning to end. It's a surprisingly enjoyable ride, albeit with some naive assumptions by our modern standards. It does, however, stand as a testimony to the hope and wonder that audiences then had in the power of Science to transform our lives.

290618,4,6300269477,"This is -in my view-THE monster movie ;an absolute classic of the mutant monster sub-genre ,this is the real thing .
Them are giant mutant ants ,the product of A-Bomb tests in New Mexico near the end of the Second World War .Years late they go om a rampage across the South-western USA ,looking for sugar and killing anyone who gets in their way.

Veteran State Trooper Sergeant Ben Peterson (James Whitmore)and his partner Officer Blackburn (Chris Drake)are the first to discover evidence of their depredations when they encounter a distraught young girl amidst the wreckage of her trailer home ,muttering ""Them ""as she sits in the middle of the wreckage .All the while the biterw inds whip up the desert sands into a storm as the tension slowly builds. Indeed ,whet sets this aside from amny inferior imitators is its measured ,atmospheric build up .It is a while before we cathch our first sight of the creatures and Gordon Douglas'direction expertly builds tension along the way
A father -daughter pair of scientists Dr Harold Medford and Dr Patricia Medford ,played respectively by Edmund Gwenn and Joan Weldon ,are called in to assist in the elimination of the problem with aid from FBI agent Robert Graham (James Arness).Some are able to eacpe the desert environment and make their way to sea and attack cargo vessels while the others congregate in the LA storm drains where the climax takes place .
The movie spawned many imitators of varying quality from the excellent (Tarantula)to the risible (The Deadly Mantis anyone?)but all fall short of the quality on display here .The acting is crisp and authoratative ;the script is pointed and pretty overt in its criticism of the nuclear age .When asked by Agent Graham what bother horrors might lie in waiting Dr Harold Medford replies ""Nobody knows .When man first entered the atomic age he opened a door into a new world. What he will find in that new world nobody can predict""
That speech sums up a whole genre and neaty exemplifies the paranoia at the root of much 1950's science fiction cum horror moviemaking .The ants do in truth look a little phoney by today's standards but they are used sparingly enough for this not to be a major problem

From its slow measured build up to its tension packed storm drian climax this is genre film making at its best .I unreservedly urge you to see it",1199404800,,2350,4.757352941176471
290619,4,6300269477,"THEM takes place in a desert in New Mexico, in U.S. government meeting rooms in Washington, D.C., and in water conduits in downtown Los Angeles.  The plot is familiar to sci-fi fans.  Monsterous creatures are created as a by-product of atomic bomb testing.  In this movie, they are giant ants.  There is an elderly professor who takes care of the scientific sleuthing.  There are various military personnel.  And there is the beautiful assistant of the professor.  At first, witnesses are quarantined or declared to be ""crazy.""  But as the plot develops, the repeated sightings of the ants make it obvious that the witnesses are to be believed.

THEM is to be commended by the acting of a little girl who is in the state of shock, because her parents had been killed by the ants.  This is an interesting nuance in the realm of cinema.  Usually it is some adult who is mentally traumatized, not a child.  THEM is also to be commended because it is often scientifically accurate.  For example, during the sleuthing efforts it was determined that the victims had a high level of formic acid in their bodies, thereby providing a tip-off that the poisoning was by way of ants (the French word for ant is ""formis.""  The term ""formic acid"" thus literally means ""ant acid."")  THEM is also to be commended for its depiction of the female assistant scientist, as she is shown to be assertive and a good source of scientific guidance.  Here, there is a close parallel with IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA.

Baby boomers who watched television or movies from the 1960s will recognize a few actors who play minor or bit parts in this film.  For example, Fess Parker (a.k.a. Davy Crockett) plays one of the early witnesses.  He is a ranch hand who happened to be flying a small plane, when he encountered a flying giant ant.  He was committed to a mental health facility, and confined by government authorities.  Fess Parker can be recognized by his handsome face, but what is more distiguishing is his poor acting abilities.  In the film under review (THEM), as well as in all the Davy Crockett movies, Fess Parker speaks his lines as though he were reciting the lines of a memorized poem.

THEM is one of the best of all the black and white science fiction films.  It is not as good as IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA, which features a six-armed octopus that attacks the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.  But it is light-years better than THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, which takes place in the arctic, and contains way too much yakking, meaningless dialogue, and has a ""monster"" that is just a man wearing rubber gloves.

The movie under review, THEM, deserves at least FOUR STARS because of its relatively intelligent dialogue and careful attention to plot development.

THEM is a good start for parents interested in teaching kids about ants.  There is one episode, where the elderly scientist gives a serious scientific lecture complete with motion picture clips, about ant behaviors.  Interested parties should also buy, ANTS:LITTLE CREATURES WHO RUN THE WORLD, produced by NOVA with noted authority Prof. Edward O. Wilson as the narrator.",1197849600,,3129,4.763940520446097

I'm not proud of that fact, but I daresay I'm not the only dumb kid who ever tortured ants for fun.  You can't tell me you've never kicked over an anthill before.  For centuries, ants have also paid the price for the ""crimes"" committed by their nastier cousins (bees, wasps, etc.) because they are the perfect scapegoats - you can find them anywhere, and they're oh so harmless (well, except for the likes of fire ants and soldier ants).  Just think about how many ants you've unknowingly squashed under your shoes over the years.  Even those who ""wouldn't hurt a fly"" have probably sent countless ants to that big ant hill in the sky.  If I were an ant, I would hunger for revenge on all the ruthless humans.  Here they are, mind bogglingly more powerful than the mightiest of their tormentors (no human can lift something twenty times his own body weight), veterans of interspecies warfare, more organized than even the mightiest of human armies, and yet they can do nothing but wish they were large enough to really teach humans a lesson.  Ironically, human beings actually grant them their wish in this seminal science fiction/horror classic.

Nothing much happens out in the New Mexico desert - until now.  It's a big mystery at first, as Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) and his partner pick up a shell-shocked young girl wandering aimlessly in the desert, then discover an abandoned car trailer down the road that has been ripped apart pretty good.  The only clues - a bloody shirt, a mysterious print in the sand, and some scattered sugar cubes.  The situation gets curiouser and curiouser when they check in at Gramps' store and find it all smashed up, just like the trailer.  Neither the cops nor FBI Agent Robert Graham (James Arness) can make heads or tails of it all.  They are still grasping at straws when Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn) and his daughter Pat (Joan Weldon) from the Department of Agriculture arrive in town.  Their suspicions are soon confirmed - it's an ant problem.  A really, really big ant problem.  A really, really big problem with really, really big ants.  Nine years after the atomic tests in that area of the desert, the radiation has caused the most unnatural of genetic mutations.  The brass wants to find and bomb the nest, but the good doctor points out the futility of such an act.  It's not just a matter of killing the gigantic ants - they have to make sure no queens have escaped to parts unknown.  If that has indeed happened, a whole army of Orkin men couldn't save mankind.

The idea of giant ants terrorizing the countryside sounds pretty hokey, but Them! is fantastically successful at presenting the story in a serious, plausible manner.  The question of whether or not to inform the public is given due consideration, for example, and the giant ants themselves are pretty impressive, especially for 1954.  I doubt they would scare even the youngest of kids in our day and time, but they are not ludicrously constructed, ridiculous looking ""monsters"" (OK, I'll admit those giant pipe cleaner antennae are borderline adorable) or the product of superimposed images of ants run amuck.  You also don't get too many shots of them along the way, and this helps the film generate an impressive amount of suspense early on.  Throw in some pretty good acting (Edmund Gwenn and James Whitmore are especially good, while James Arness' voice alone lends a serious air to every scene) and a minimum of nuclear bomb moralizing, and you've got yourself one of the best classic monster movies ever made.",1195948800,,3669,4.738582677165354
290623,5,6300269477,"The film begins with a small plane flying over the desert. The pilot calls the police car to tell of a lone figure walking in the desert. This small girl is speechless. Next the police car stops by the car and trailer beside the road. The trailer is torn up, as if by a giant beast. Strange marks are in the sand, unlike any known animal. They hear a high-pitched chirping. It must be the wind. The patrol car finds a dead body in the destroyed store. What is going on? They hear more high-pitched chirps. The policeman left behind is killed. It must be a homicidal maniac, no money was taken. An FBI agent arrives to investigate, the husband in the trailer was an FBI agent. A pair of biologists arrive to investigate. The first atomic bomb was exploded in this area. [Is this a clue?]

The wind blew away the clues in the dust. The myrmicologist says something may have happened that could panic the nation. A giant ant threatens the beautiful young scientist. A burst from a Thompson machine gun kills it. There will be many others back at the nest. Atomic radiation must have caused a mutation! They find the nest and discuss how to kill the ants at high noon. Cyanide gas is used to destroy the giant ants. But now volunteers must investigate the nest to see if any ants survived. Two empty egg cases are found, queen ants have escaped to repopulate their species! The General must inform Washington about this danger to the nation. The film explains the life of ants.

There is a report of strange flying ants near Brownsville Texas. They were heading west. [This news must be kept from the public, Washington knows what is best for the nation.] A ship at sea that held ants was sunk by naval gunfire. A railroad car was broken into, tons of sugar stolen. Then they get a clue where the ants may be hiding: the Los Angeles storm sewer system. An emergency is declared for Los Angeles, all must stay indoors after 6PM. Extremely dangerous creatures are hiding underground! Life as we know it is threatened.

A combined Army-Marine task force is sent into the storm sewers to search and destroy the enemy ants. [This elaborate sewer system must have been very profitable in graft.] The two boys are found and saved by heroic action. The soldiers arrive to destroy the hidden danger. They must find and destroy the egg chamber. Could there be others? No one can predict what could happen from atomic bomb explosions. [No mention of radioactive fallout or a nuclear winter here.] This is a very good drama that warns against the unintended consequences from science for the military.

3. the monster(s) were on screen for maybe a total of five minutes

Interesting is that this was originally to be a big budget picture.. In color, longer, with more special effects. But, money pressure cut it back to what it is (Probably a better flick).

290678,5,6300269477,"Yes sir, those o'l World War Two generation people knew how to make a monster movie when they had the money.  Someone gets gobbled up by something from outerspace or underground, someone lives to tell about it, the Army finds out saying--""Well, that it for them!""  and in they go with everything they got.  All that and James Whitmore, James Arness, and the cutie Joan Weldon and a ton of ammunition.  This is kind of a serious movie so it requires both popcorn and hot dogs and soda--and remember, when you watch it you haven't got a clue what it's about.

PROS:

1.  Story line better than so-so.  Handled seriously.  The writers and director took the time to figure it all out before they shot it including having the police in the movie pick up enough clues to tell them what was going on.

2.  Whitmore and Arness star...that's a star there.

3.  Even the little girl in the first scene can act and she only say's one word!.....I'm watching this again as I write...tell me something--is there anybody in this movie who 'can not' act?

4.  At the scene where Whitmore and his police partner enter the general story that has been broke in.  The evidence is mounting.  They find a 30-30 rifle behind the counter...the barrel is bent double.  They find the owner under a trap door in the floor--dead.  A noise from across the room, Whitmore gets up, right hand pats holstered pistol--he gets a stern look on his face then he and his partner advance on the position where the sound came from.  The beginning of the movie is like this, no filler.  By the numbers.  I wish our police were like that around here.

5.  There is no doubt about it, the writer of is movie knew exactly what he was doing.  Yes...five stars to the writer.  Whitmore's partner is left alone--We know what's about to happen to him, don't we--Whitmore goes for help.  His partner (a stern face strong lookin fellow) walks into another room, looks down.  Whitmore is heard driving away.  He goes into the ajoining room to turn the radio off.  A sound is heard--it's the monster sound.  He hears it, turns, pulls his gun--smart guy. Without taking his eyes off the direction of the sound, takes a step or two forward to the pull chain light.  Standing under it, no expression change on his face--eyes never wavering from the direction of that sound...neither does his gun.  He reaches up, finds the pull chain switch without looking and turns the light out.  Two steps forward and he is out of that room.  A glance left then right to find the light switch, he finds it, turns the light off...his gun never left the direction of the sound, (is this guy combat trained or something?).  He eases forward, small steps, soft around fifteen steps, never does his eyes or gun waver in the least from that sound.  The monster sound shoots up in volume.  He hesitates, eyes swivel left then right like a gun turret, searching for anything--anything at all.  His gun never moves off target.  The sound is identified as coming from outside, through a big hole in the wall.  He steps to the edge of the hole and stops.  He turns his head right then left--I figure his was making sure which direction the sound came from.  The sound is coming from the left, his head stays turned left, he blinks then steps through the hole.  There is no need to go futher with this discription--we all know what he found.  I will say he got off five shots (off screen) before he yelled.  So, why am I writing this?  Well, it goes to realism.  In all the movies you watch, if there is a darkened corner or hole for a monster to crawl into and hide the actors will find a way to walk or crawl close to it until the monster gets them.  This law officer had the look on his face and (with a little more training about taking proper cover) attention to stealth, and attention span focussing on a possible enemy I've seen from some of our soldiers during Vietnam.  Unlike in the movies...they 'never' took their eyes off their target, and let's face it, his stern face had the look of walking towards a date with destiny.  I don't remember who he is, but he sure could act!

Seven.  I don't seen any reason to go through this step by step and tell you everything...I'll jump ahead toward the end.

8.  We're in the sewer system now, (or something like it).  The ants have found a new home...they been there for months.  The army is in there to, searching for Them and two lost boys.  James Whitmore gets chewed up by one of the ants as he was saving the two lost boys.  James Arness holds his head up to hear his last words.  The kids are safe.  There is shooting going on, the ants have found the small army unit.  Arness walks back to them and for 23 seconds I have never seen so much ordinance shot down range (in corridor like conditions) at any target as what I have seen here.  It makes me wonder if back in World War Two when some of our smaller units stumbled across an enemy tank/s who spots them at the same time...what was their reaction?  I bet it was pretty close to the same...throw everything you got at'em as quickly as you can, or run.

CONS:

1.  There are no cons in this movie.

Few times have I ever seen a movie so well put together.  The writing is perfect, the actors really act, no subplots get in the way and take away from the main story line and focus.  There is no filler I could find, everyword, every hand motion, seemingly every hand gesture pointed at one thing...the story.  Tight, percise, writing.  It is because of the writing, acting, and obviously directing, THEM must have five stars.  Even though all of it is laid out for the viewer sooner or later I feel you should have the full spread while you watch.  The lights must go off, only you watching the movie so your attention isn't elsewhere--one salad bowl of popcorn, two hot dogs, and a big drink to wash it down with.

This kind of movie doesn't require thought to understand--it demands your full attention to get the most out of it.  Bye.

P.S.  For those of you who never seen handgrenade explosions the size of these smoke and dusk clouds thrown up by the rifle grenades is pretty close to accurate...of course real military explosions happen in the blink of an eye rather than so slow.",1177545600,7,6221,4.427561837455831

The effects in this movie are a marvel even today.  The producers of ""THEM,"" could have easily used forced-perspective on real ants, forcing actors to react to empty air and reducing realism.  Instead, they built highly realistic giant ants which still look life-like even compared to more recent attempts in this genre, by movies with much higher budgets, like ""Empire of the Ants.""  The pace of the movie is fast, so the watcher tends to ignore the fact that a backwoods sherrif quickly becomes a major player, even in a room with Army generals.  Anyone who has ever stepped on a red anthill, knows how fierce ants can be, so how much more fierce is an ant 15 feet long.

290739,5,6300269477,"Here's a wonderful example of crisp, solid movie-making from the 1950s that still holds up well today. Yes, the special effects are a bit dated -- but that happens to all special effects in time. What matters is how the story is told. And in this case, it's told powerfully & enjoyably, owing a good deal to noir sensibility. In fact, it initially unfolds like a mystery; and even when the science-fiction element becomes clear, it's still handled in a realistic fashion. As for those special effects ants, the film is wise in depicting them sparingly, often obscured by sandstorms, shadows, etc. Combined with an eerie & effective sound effect, they can still evoke chills.

One of the striking things about this film is its humanity -- the characters have their own little quirks, humor emerges at the most unexpected times, and the viewer really feels the fear & concern that our protagonists feel. For example, the terror & dread displayed by the mother awaiting word of her two missing sons comes across intensely. She's played as a real person affected by events, not just a cardboard cutout. The female scientist is both warm & competent, a strong figure rather than a helpless damsel in distress. The two heroic leads display fear & even terror in certain crucial scenes. And a startling twist towards the end demonstrates that being a lead character is not always enough to ensure survival.

290783,5,6300269477,"It's great to finally see this fifties classic on DVD. I'm not sure what some reviewers were talking about...this is, in my opinion, a very CRISP transfer, the best version of the film I've ever seen. Perhaps their sets need adjusting.

As some mention, the 'extras' aren't much. An interview or commentary with James Whitmore would be a welcome addition, but the movie is great on its own.

Why recount the plot? If you've seen it, you know it, if you haven't, just watch the movie!

Warners was looking for a follow-up to Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, their biggest money-maker of 1951. When Ted Sheridan's script was chosen, it was initially given the 'A picture' treatment. It was going to be in color, and 3-D, with an 'A' movie cast. As the time for filming apprached, Warners got cold feet, and the first two concepts were shelved, though the picture still has a color title card.

The lucky thing is that the solid cast remained...James Whitmore, James Arness, Academy Award winner Edmund Gwynne, Joan Weldon (in an inappropriate tweed suit and hat...which I loved, because what would a fifties woman coming to New Mexico from Washington, DC, wear? and she ditched it later on...smart girl.)

Throw in a great group of character players, including bit parts from Richard Deacon, Leonard Nimoy, William Schallart, and most famously, Fess Parker (legend is that this part led to his being cast as Davy Crockett), Onslow Stephens (""Drain 227 !!!""), Olin Howard (""Make me a sergeant and gimme the booze!"")and one of my faves, Dub Taylor (""Is sugar a rare cargo? Is there a market for it? You ever hear of a fence for hot sugar?""), plus numerous other recognizable bit players (Mrs. Lodge, the LA beat cops, Kibbie.)

Helmed by B-director Gordon Douglas, the film has a realism and snappy feel missing from most 'monster pics.' This film was very much a reflection of the hard-nosed atmospheric film noir of the late 40s-early 50s on which Douglas had frequently worked. Note the whirring fans, the boiling coffee, the radio broadcasts, the ceilings on the room sets. Whitmore recounted that they set up the general store, and then he, Arness, and Douglas took hatchets to it to create the 'ant destruction chaos'. Can you imagine actors doing this today?

This movie is what RKO scare-master Val Lewton would have made if he made fifties sci-fi. (Of course, Robert Wise, one of Lewton's prodigies, did make 'The Day the Earth Stood Still', another understated classic...I've always considered Them! to be a 'sister piece', along with Howard Hawks' ""The Thing from Another World', which has a similar feel to it (as well as also another 'spunky-but-gorgeous heroine' who is ahead of her time but admitted to the 'inner circle' by the menfolk, both of whom look great in slacks!)

The score by A-movie composer Bronislaw Kaper is one of the key elements to the film. Music is missing at some times of suspense, but greatly enhances others.

The photography is wonderful. The shots of ""New Mexico"" and the storm drains of LA are both well-done and unforgettable.

and what lines!

""Look at the walls, held together with saliva!""

""Right now, spit's about all that's holding me together, too!""

""Please, my nerves!""

""we may be witness to a Biblical prophesy come true...""

""There's no homicidal maniac in this case.""

""Give it to us straight, Doc. Get to the verb.""

""He's with the government, so watch your step.""

""Stay loose, huh?""

""THEM ! THEM!""

(A special kudos to an amazing little girl. She set the tone right off, and the rest of the story took off from there.)

By the way, it is easy to tell that the film was originally intended for 3-D. Next time you watch, look at shots like the hovering helicopter, the trees and cactus in the desert, the ants coming straight towards the screen, etc. To my knowledge, though, it wasn't shot using the process...I've never known it to be shown that way, anyway.

A treat to watch again and again, this one is a Halloween fixture, along with ""Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""The Thing"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"", ""I Married a Monster from Outer Space"", ""It Came from Outer Space"" and any Ray Harryhausen film.

290785,4,6300269477,"These days it is common for parents to take young children to all kinds of scary movies. It was different long ago. No parent would take a young child to an evening movie. What they did was send them to the Saturday horror movie matinee with their older brothers and sisters.

This happened to me in 1954 at the tender age of seven when I was sent with my older sister to see ""Them,"" a science fiction classic about giant mutant ants created in atom bomb testing. The giant ants invade LA, breaking into box cars filled with sugar and killing screaming people left and right, crushing them in their horrific jaws.

I spent most of the movie in the lobby, watching through the curtains they had in those days, too frightened to be in the dark. The WORST thing was that the giant ants made a sound sort of like giant crickets and for several years after I had to talk myself into going to sleep -- ""It's just crickets, not giant ants, not giant ants, not giant ...""

  this movie never lets itself get to far away from the truth of the moment and because it is done so ,it gives the film the feel of something that is really happening.

290787,5,6300269477,"Them!  is on my short list for top billing among the 50's classic sci-fi movies.  Even after more than half a century I think you will find the story is still engaging and the characters memorable, thanks to a well written screenplay and strong performances from some first rate actors.

The film opens as a kind of `who done it' mystery revolving around the exact nature of the title characters, and evolves into a well developed ""man against nature gone wild"" piece.  I won't say more than that because, on the off chance you have never seen this film, you should NOT read the spoilers contained in most of these reviews, because the mysterious way in which the title characters are introduced is part of the charm of the film.

Yes, the film is shot in black and white, and yes some of the special effects are a bit dated by today's standards, but the cinematography, art direction, sound design etc. are all first rate as befitting a release from a major studio.  To be perfectly honest I thought some of the effects looked a bit cheesy even 40 odd years ago when I first saw the film, but it didn't detract one bit from my enjoyment of the movie then and still doesn't today.  In fact, as some others have noted, they are part of the charm of the film.  The ""Fan-belt coming loose"" sounds that someone here so aptly described is an example of how a simple element was used very effectively.  To this day, that sound sets my teeth on edge and sends a shiver up my spine.  As noted above, the cinematography, staging, lighting etc, are exceptionally well done, and I consider the opening shot of the search airplane panning down to the little girl walking in the desert in the opening sequence to be one of the all time classic images in the genre.

Contrary to some comments here, I did not find the plot to be thin or simplistic at all.  Plot wise (and production value wise), Them! Looks like Doctor Zhivago, compared to some of the other '90 minute wonders' filmed in the fifties.  I think the producers felt that with giant radioactive bugs to keep the action going, the film did not need any of the lame artifices used to `punch up' plots in some of today's movies.  So you won't find shallow self-involved characters sniping at each other in nauseating interpersonal conflicts.  You won't find a ridiculously over the top arch-villain who is so evil that he makes milkshakes out of pureed body parts.  You won't find a pimply light-saber wielding gen-X'er whining because folks just don't understand him.  Nor will you find bad Soap-Opera thinly disguised as an SF storyline [ala all this ""Who's having who's alien baby?"" crapola we see these days on the sci-fi channel].

What you WILL FIND is a CLASSIC 50's style sci-fi yarn, which is one of the finest examples of an SF film of that era.",1145318400,10,2801,4.5458167330677295
290788,4,6300269477,"""Them!"" is another of the sci-fi/horror movies of the 1950's.  Premiering on June 16th of 1954 in New York City, ""Them!"" is one of the earliest creature features.  I wonder what younger viewers think when they watch these old films.  Do they hold the same fascination that they did for those of us who were growing up in an era before CGI?  The special effects in this movie are laughable today, but at the time this was released they earned an Oscar nomination.

The story here is very simple.  The first test of the atomic bomb has resulted in the mutation of ants in the desert so that they now are from 9 to 12 meters in length and are killing people in the South-west United States.  The science part of this science-fiction story is pretty weak, but on the other hand they at least try to stay true to the nature of ants.  James Whitmore plays State Police Sgt. Ben Peterson and James Arness plays FBI agent Robert Graham.  These characters chase the ants from the desert of New Mexico to the storm sewers of Los Angeles.  Edmund Gwenn and Joan Weldon play father and daughter scientists Harold and Patricia Medford, who help them track down and destroy the mutated ants.

The DVD does not hold much in the way of extras.  There is some archival footage of the giant ants, and a trailer, but that is all.  Overall, this movie rates somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I am going to give it the higher rating because when all is said and done it is an entertaining movie.  I would think this would be a good candidate for a Hollywood remake, using modern special effects, but for some reason it has not been done yet.",1145059200,4,1623,4.402684563758389

There are others we love (I myself have a great and abiding fondness for I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, and some folks swear by WAR OF THE WORLDS), but these five, though they did not exhaust the genre (as Hollywood understood the genre), certainly defined it during their decade and well into the 1960s, until 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.",1142899200,2,586,4.689320388349515

THEM has classic written all over its giant bugs menace the world premise. Indeed, for a film of its time, nothing was more realistic or scarier than THEM.

The premise is that due to nuclear weapons, a massive army of humongous ants has been birthed, and now the world is in danger of annihilation from these giant mutant ants. The army is scrambling to find ways to scrap these big bugs, but who ever said killing something much larger than you was easy? Set out in the Arizona desert, the movie is realistic thanks to it's not-so-crazy special effects and its surreal setting. The bugs begin to massacre the army trying to erase them, one individual at a time; they're also trying to kill off more of the local population and work their way to the nation's population, and eventually, world domination. The ultimate showdown has the army trying to trap the ants back in their own turf, and the climax and results are explosive. Definitely not a cheap ending, it closes the movie on a thrilling note.

So if you're a big fan of the sci-fi movies and horror films of the 50s and 60s, this film is just right up your alley. THEM is a classic scare, and it will have you thinking about what's to come for the future...do giant bugs really exist in our future? Ha! Think again.

Sometimes it's hard to separate science from fiction giving that radiation played a part in mutating a natural product of the earth known to us as the ant species. But it happened in New Mexico as the story begins. A child wandering  alone in the desert carrying her doll is in shock. She has a look of horror in her face that will forever be etched in your mind. And the final scene with the heroic struggle of James Arness (The Thing From Another World) and the Army trying to destroy the insects is epic to say the least.

It seems that man, due to his desire to build and test new weapons, twisted nature to the point where even innocent ants became monsters. Great stuff. James Arness is his usual manly, rugged self in this picture, and James Whitmore was great as the hard-nosed cop. I may be wrong about this, but wasn't the pilot in the asylum a very young Fess Parker?

A Cold War metaphor in which a very committed U.S. Army takes on the invader (significantly without resorting to any of the obligatory 1950's garage-built gizmos that pepper monster movies), the film is remarkable, especially among its genre, for a strong script, suspenseful storyline, and performances that hold up amazingly well after fifty years.

James Arness stars as the hero, while Edmund Gwenn portrays the twinkly old scientist, a role he reprised numerous times. Joan Weldon plays Gwenn's daughter, likewise a scientist, in one of the most evenhanded, competent characterizations of a woman professional ever put on celluloid.

290862,5,6300269477,"It's amazing how well some of these old movies hold up sometimes--detail for detail much may not compare with a contemporary film: the dialogue may sound a tad antiquated or the special effects might seem a little thrift shop. What works is the whole ensemble: the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. Actors seemed to act better--many had stage experience and had a finer sense of themselves before a camera; character actors were richer and more interesting; direction seemed more solid, and the lighting and effects people knew how to generate real suspense and mystery with minimal materials. That requires real talent. Current product is glossy and seamless, but it's also frequently empty.

I also like the fact that decent people back then were presented as just that: decent, and often well-adjusted. These days every decent soul seems to have a tormented background. That's to add a little more drama to the flick. Nobody's just good as they stand; groups and teams aren't well adapted and efficient. There's always the problem person, or the complete jerk, or the worthless or cowardly leader.

I love this as a great sci-fi horror flick--in fact it's the prototype for the second Alien film (there's even a ""Newt"" here, and Newt's broken doll). But more than anything I love it for its portrayal of people working together--selflessly and without ego--to save the world. The only significant bump occurs when the men try to become gallant with the female scientist and she immediately reads them the riot act and the movie proceeds, in fact proceeds with the woman assuming the team leader position. Think about that. This is a Fifties film. She doesn't get the responsibility because of affirmative action, or quotas, or because she's the biggest b*tch around, or even because she's romancing or manipulating the alpha male, she gets it because she's the best qualified for it. This is potent stuff and it's done completely without moralizing, political correctness, or self-consciousness.

Today's films seem to be about nothing but ego. ""Teams,"" when you can find them, consist of individuals who constantly duke it out among themselves or agonize over their own predicaments despite the immediacy of dire threats that should have them sticking all that nonsense on a back burner. Sadly, it's an accurate depiction of the real world, especially the corporate world. This movie was made back when plenty of people had pretty recent memories of a war where teams learned how to work together for SURVIVAL. Today you can't even get a bunch of special interest groups to ditch their individual agendas for the few moments it would take to pull together and get one half-baked frat-boy out of the White House.

So compare this movie in this regard to Alien II sometime. It's quite an experience. I wish our kids got more exposure to this kind of stuff.",1116201600,14,2871,4.962577962577963

Of course we usually only get to see the heads when the ants are alive to alleviate the need to automate the legs and body parts.  The back story actually moves along pretty well and it was amusing to see the original cop [Shawshank Redemption?] pressed into service and becoming an authority figure towards the end.  Typical interplay with old professorial `expert' brought in with his attractive assistant/daughter and the stalwart, wooden FBI agent assigned to the case.  Transfer to DVD looked really good too.

290889,5,6300269477,"In the late 1940's and 1950's the USA and the Soviet Union repeatedly tested nuclear bombs. In the USA the early tests were done in the desert southwest, and the mushroom clouds could be seen for dozens of miles (and the noise could be heard for hundreds of miles). As scientists measured the increased levels of radiation in milk served to schoolchildren and their parents built bomb shelters in their backyards, Hollywood decided to take the cold war paranoia which made the fifties so unique and create a new type of sci-fi/horror movie - the ""mutant monster"" film. Along with the original ""Godzilla"", 1954's ""Them"" is one of the best of the lot. It starts out in the New Mexico desert, where two state troopers discover a mobile home that's been ripped apart by some unknown animal. The adults are missing, but they do find a terrified little girl (a creepy Sandy Descher) who's so shocked that she can't talk and simply stares wide-eyed and zombie-like at the policemen. A fierce sandstorm blows up, and the troopers then arrive at a local general store that's been ripped apart like the trailer. Curiously no money or valuables were stolen, but sugar has been spread everywhere, and the owner's corpse is found. He had emptied his shotgun at his attacker before being killed with a massive injection of acid. The troopers also find some tracks from an ""unknown"" large animal. Baffled by this turn of events, one trooper takes the mute little girl to a hospital. The other trooper stays behind to guard the store, but he is attacked and killed by an unknown assailant. The next day Robert Graham (a pre-Gunsmoke James Arness), an FBI agent, arrives to help with the investigation. Soon they are joined by two scientists from the Agriculture Dept. in Washington - the eccentric but brilliant Dr. Harold Medford (a scene-stealing Edmund Gwenn) and his lovely daughter and assistant, Dr. Pat Medford (Joan Weldon). The scientists have a hunch that the ""unknown"" animal that killed the storeowner and destroyed the buildings was - a giant ant! The ants had been at the site of the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico in 1945, and the radiation has caused them to mutate to an enormous, man-eating size. Soon our heroic quartet is involved in a race against time to find and destroy the ant's colony before they can reproduce and spread across the world. When the queen ant and some male escorts escape the search becomes even more frantic, and leads to a final showdown in the vast sewers of Los Angeles. This film features fine performances by all three of the male leads - James Whitmore as the gruff-but-warm-hearted New Mexico cop, Arness as the quintessentially stern and macho 1950's movie hero, and Gwenn as the quirky ant expert. Although the special effects are obviously primitive by today's standards, ""Them"" actually had a larger budget than most fifties sci-fi movies, and the ants themselves were an impressive creation for their time. This film also features an impressive number of cameos by future celebrities, including Fess Parker of ""Davy Crockett"" fame in a hilarious role as a hillbilly pilot who sees three ""ant-shaped"" UFOs buzzing his airplane. When he tells his story he is declared ""crazy"" and locked in a mental hospital. Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek's ""Mr. Spock"") also has a tiny cameo. ""Them"" was so successful that it was followed by a string of imitators, but it remains superior to all of them.

and this film was it for ""giant bug"" catagory. There would be 100's
of atomic age nightmares to follow but none more better put togethe
than this well oiled machine.
The story begins as that of a police drama.  A little girl is found
wandering in the Nevada desert by local police. Although alive shes
in a state of shock which adds to mystery to her folks where-abouts
When the two officers are radioed in to check out a nearby trailer
they find it's wall pulled out and insides wrecked.  After Piecing
together a few clues the officers realized that this is the lost
girl's home and that her parents are perhaps the subjects of foul
play. On another nearby call the two officers investigate an old
supplyshack only to find it also in the same condition as trailer
with one added element,the body of ""Pops"" the store's owner dead
and lying mangled at the bottom of the cellar. One officer leaves
to get help while the other stays behind at the crime scene. When
he goes out back to search for the source of a wierd high pitched
chirping sound,he fires his weapon,screams & also becomes victim.
Upon the autopsy of ""Pops"" it's discovered that on top of broken
up condition he also has enough formic acid in him to kill 20 men
The FBI is called in and along with the 1st officer go back where
the little girl was found and it is there that they encounter the
horror of nature's fury in the form of giant ants mutated from a
deployment of atomic radiation.
This fomula would be followed time and time again in such lowbrow
features as Tarantula, Beginning of the End & Earth vs.the spider
but none would come close to the sincerity of this Warner brother
classic. With a cast that includes James Whitmore, James Arness &
Edmund Gwenn and great final battle under streets of Los Angleles
it's simple entertainment from a simple time that holds up after
repeated watchings. Look for Fess Parker and Leonard Nemoy cameos
And listen to the ""scream effects"" these are Warner bros patented

I can remember watching this on Saturday afternoon, frozen to my chair but unable to walk away, being sobered and thrilled by Edmund Gwenn's last line on the unknown effects of our dropping the atomic bomb.

The cast is surprisingly memorable: James Whitmore, James Arness, Edmund Gwenn, Fess Parker. Unfortunately the cast listing is short, so the many other familiar character actors who appeared are not recognized, and it's a shortcoming of the otherwise fun extras that they don't fill in this gap. Heck, Leonard Nimoy has a small part, though it's not referenced anywhere on the disc!  Action is sporadic and the ants are a bit ... okay, a lot ... laughable.

Extras also include ""Bugged at the Movies"", text pages about the many giant bug movies that followed; a 3-minute dose of film clips called ""Behind the Scnes"" but mainly just clips of clapboards; 25 stills, including posters.

This is one of those ""radiation gets the blame again"" movies.  James Whitmore is a desert-town sheriff who investigates some mysterious murders and gets more than he bargained for.  It seems that 12-foot-long ants are marauding through the desert--and reproducing.
The film has the standard cast of characters for a movie of this type--scientists, military types, and local cops.  The plotline is simple...track down all the ants and kill them.  Throw in a couple of kids missing is some drainage tunnel and you pretty much have the entire story.
The acting is credible, including Fes Parker--in a pre-Daniel Boone role--as a pilot forcibly confined to a mental institution after he claims he saw giant ants flying around his plane in mid-flight.  The special effects are passable, at best.  Then, again, you can't really expect filmmakers of the day to be able to effectively convey a sense of realism to the giant ant effects (done with puppets).

The sincerity of these performances along with the marvelous sound effects makes THEM a true classic of its kind.  Compared to today's CGI generated effects, THEM can't hold a candle.

Beginning in the radioactive deserts of New Mexico, where the national security state and atomic bomb testing had caught public attention, this 1954 film takes viewers on a ride through the unpredictable and dangerous potential consequences of playing with the basic matter of the universe.  It's highly entertaining, with a decent cast and dated special effects, but great story-line.  The film begins in the stark desert landscapes and ends underground in the vast sewer system of Los Angeles, including some striking shots of the trickling Los Angeles River.  This is one sci-fi film where the real problem comes not from ""out there"" or from strange alien creatures from outer space, but rather from the consequences of our own recklessness.  If the film was bad science, at least it had the insight to question whether we really had as much control over the consequences of this atomic testing as the authorities liked to pretend.

Standing head, shoulders, waist and knees about the competition, THEM is a well-researched tale of giant ants.  Yes, we know that ants and other insects could not really reach these sizes and still be able to move, but that is the only leap of faith in the film.
Atomic testing has allowed a colony of ants to reach gigantic proportions.  there presence is made known when a small girl survives an attack and is found wandering along a deserted desert road.
Edmund Gwenn (Santa Clause from Miracle on 42nd Street) plays the scientist who helps to understand, track, and overcome the ants.  Someone went to a lot of trouble to research all of the information Gwenn reveals.  All of it true.
Unfortunately, the discover of the giant colony is a little too late, new ant queens have been born and need to be found.  One such queen has moved into the storm tunnels in L.A.

290942,5,6300269477,"So screams the young Ellinson girl (Sandy Descher), who had previously been discovered wandering alone, and in a state of shock, by state troopers along a lonely highway in the hot New Mexico desert in 1954.  A few miles from where the unresponsive girl was found, troopers found a mutilated trailer, the girl's home; but there was no sign of her parents.  Instead, the troopers found unusual footprints and a sticky white substance and hear strange sounds in the distance.  To help solve this seemingly bizarre murder investigation, Police Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore, who played Carnes in ""Oklahoma!"" in 1955, Adm. Bull Halsey in ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" in 1970, and continues to act in the 2003 TV series ""Mister Sterling"") and FBI agent Robert Graham (James Arness, who later became TV icon Marshall Matt Dillon in the long-running series ""Gunsmoke"") have plaster casts made from the footprints and sent them to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., along with samples of the sticky white substance.  Befuddled, the FBI forwarded the evidence to the Dept. of Agriculture, where two scientists are astounded by what was found.  The two scientists, Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn, whose film career began in 1916) and Dr. Patricia 'Pat' Medford (Joan Weldon), rushed to New Mexico to investigate the findings first hand.  Upon their arrival, the doctors visit the Ellinson girl with Ben.  Dr. Medford tells Ben that the sticky white substance contains large amounts of formic acid.  When he holds a vial of formic acid in front of the Ellinson girl's nose, she awakens from her shock, screams, and yells, ""Them! Them! Them!""
Unwilling to share their understanding of the footprints and the presence of formic acid (and to the dismay of Ben, who only wants to solve the Ellinson's disappearance), the two doctors insist on being taken to the Ellinson's trailer.  There, they find more footprints.  Pat wanders away from the trailer to search for more evidence, but suddenly, an enormous dark creature rises from behind a sand dune: a giant ant!  Pat screams and runs, but Ben is nearby and shoots the ant which finally dies.  Dr. Medford finally reveals his understanding: ants have mutated in the New Mexico desert because of nearby atomic bomb testing.  The Ellinson's disappearance is solved, but the true terror is only beginning because some ants can fly!
""Them!"" typifies the classic 1950's sci-fi/horror film with all of the essential elements:
(1) The kindly, eccentric and all-knowing scientist (Dr. Medford),
(2) Unforeseen consequences resulting from atomic testing and threaten the entire human race,
(3) Brave and unselfish heroes (Ben Peterson and Robert Graham) who help save the world,
(4) The woman ('Pat' Medford) who is romanced by one of the heroes (Robert) after meeting him because of the unforeseen consequences.
Filmed in black and white, the special effects used in ""Them!"" were remarkably good for the time. In addition, the acting (under the direction of Gordon Douglas) was superb, considering how many ""B-movie"" sci-fi/horror films were produced during the early years of the nuclear age.  Other characters that made this film highly entertaining include mental patient Jensen (Olin Howlin, whose lengthy film career began in 1918), General Robert O'Brien (Onslow Stevens) and Mrs. Lodge (Mary Alan Hokanson).
If you enjoy watching sci-fi/horror films with giant bugs, you will probably enjoy ""Them!"".  For superb acting, good special effects and an engaging story, I rate ""Them!"" with 5 out of 5 stars.

290995,4,6300269477,"I first saw this movie on TV in the late 1950's when I was a young kid.  There were a ton of ""B"" Science Fiction movies back then.  Most of them were quite forgettable.  Some, like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" were rather good on a cerebral level.  Some, like ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" were so bad they were funny.  However, all suffered from the limitations of the special effects of the day.  Of course, we didn't understand those limitations back then so we enjoyed the heck out of most of them.  There were a few, however, that stood out.  ""Them!"" is my personal favorite of the era.  It had all of the ususal elements of the genre; radiation mutated monsters, elderly scientist with attractive secretary/daughter/understudy, no-nonsense government agent hero (who naturally falls for the attractive secretary/daughter/understudy), and a climatic battle where the good guys beat the mutants with the fate of the world in the balance.  There are several things that make this movie stand out above the others of its' era.  First of all, the acting is good and pretty much good all around.  James Arness is good but my favorite was the role of James Whitmore.  Secondly, there is a better sense of the dramtic in this movie.  The opening scene grabs our attention.  A trailer home out in the desert has been ransacked with no apparent motive.  Why?  There is the young girl who was found.  She is obviously in a state of shock.  Everyone who has seen this movie remember her screaming out the title name ""Them!"" when she hears the eerie noise of an unseen menace.  Finally, there just seems to be a lot more action in this movie.  Instead of just one major conflict, we get a series of man vs mutant battles.  The final battle is terrific.
A TV station was showing a weekly science fiction movie and I watched a lot of old clunkers with my 9 year old son.  The night they showed ""Them!""

290997,5,6300269477,"THEM! should feel old, quaint, and dated, but it doesn't at all.  There is no question it has a 1950s feel, and the special effects are [weak] by today's standards.  But whereas most of the films of the fifties featuring atomically altered monsters can only be watched with a grain of salt, one has to make no concessions to THEM! at all.
Although one might start with the cast for the source of the film's success, I think one ought to begin with the director, Gordon Douglas.  He is not one of Hollywood's elite directors, but his decision to film the entire movie in a completely nonsensationalist style is what really makes the movie successful.  The tone of the entire film is businesslike, and with no panic on the part of the principles.  There is a seriousness that they are dealing with a horror of nature, but at every moment, everyone manages to keep their wits.  This is emphasized by many keys scenes that are shot with no music or sound effects, which makes the sound effects, when they come, far more effective.  As a result, even with a lesser cast, I think this film would have been quite successful.  It is also marvelously photographed.
The cast is, nonetheless, quite excellent, and while it might have been good without James Whitmore, James Arness, and especially Edmund Gwenn, it definitely wouldn't have been as good.  Each one of them plays their parts completely straight, and one of the reasons that we, the viewers, can take this story of giant ants so seriously is because these actors all do.  Whitmore, who has long since settled into a career as a first rate character actor (still active--he appeared in Jim Carrey's THE MAJESTIC just last year), does a great job, though I must admit that I was confused as to why a local law enforcement officer would continue to be involved in affairs that clearly extend beyond his jurisdiction.  The one irritating element, as in virtually every Sci-fi film, is the beautiful, inconceivably young female scientist.  I love the idea of female scientists, but why must they all be 21, have a Ph. D., and be both brilliant and possess a great fashion sense?
After fifty years, THEM! manages to stand up very, very well, and remains not just one of the great Sci-fi films of the atomic age, but of all time.",1033776000,6,2274,4.6575

291000,5,6300269477,"Fans of classic science fiction movies should rejoice with the release of ""Them!"" on DVD. Now if only they would release ""The Day the Eartn Stood Still,"" ""The Thing,"" or ""Beast Fron 20,000 Fathoms."" Oh well, it's a start, at least.
And if the other movies are released in as fine a shape on DVD as ""Them!"" we fans will be even more fortunate. The DVD transfer is sharp, even allowing us to read the State Police patch on James Whitmore's shoulder, and remains that way all through the film. Don't expect too much from the added 'extras', however. Since I've never heard of any existing behind-the-scenes documentary, my disappointment is muted. Having the film is the important thing.
And what a film. Made during that golden age of science fiction movies when the Bomb hung over our heads like the sword of Damocles, ""Them!"" boasts an intelligent script and superb acting. Even the ants, easily the weakest part of the film, still hold up after all these years. Every once in a while, talk of a remake surfaces, figuring that with today's special effects, the movie could become even more effective. However, I hope that never comes to pass, for today's science fiction pictures often sacrifice script and acting in favor of dazzling special effects, and what makes ""Them!"" so effective as a science fiction picture is the script and the acting.
The strength of the movie is its initial treatment as a sort of murder mystery, into which New Mexico State Trooper James Whitmore is drawn after he and his partner discover a young girl wandering across the desert in a state of shock. Her trailer home looks caved out rather than caved in, and her parents are inexplicably missing. Her father being an FBI agent on vacation causes fellow agent James Arness to investigate. He, in turn, brings in Onslow Stevens (""House of Dracula"") as an Air Force Intelligence Officer, and Edmund Gwenn and Joan Weldon as a father-daughter team of scientists who suspect the worst and are not diappointed.
The film keeps this sort of noirish mood until the end with the battle in the sewers of Los Angeles. Look for Leonard Nimoy as an Army sergeant, Fess Parker as a shaken pilot and Olin Howard as a rsident in the alcoholic ward who keeps seeing giant ants in the rail yard below. (Howard later played the first victim in ""The Blob."")
I mentioned in the title of this review that ""Them!"" i the best of the red scare movies. At heart, that's what the film really is and we can take a special delight in the knowledge of it. The setting is at White Sands, nine years after the atomic bomb tests. It is determined that the ants only developed recently (Coming of the Cold War), live in underground nests (cells), totally subservient to the needs of the society and its queen, or leader. (Communists were often compared to social insects in critiques of their society.) The fact that the first victim is an FBI agent (and a good family man from what we are led to believe) brings in the FBI and Air Force Intelligence. The appearance of the scientists is frosting on the cake: they understand the nature of the enemy and develop the plans to stop them. It is also interesting that throughout the film the ants are simply referred to as ""Them,"" almost as in ""Us versus them.""
Even if you don't agree with the above analysis, the film is still a treat to watch and holds up well to repeated viewings. Bu the way, the film is restored to its original setting: black and white, with only the opening title in color. Of course, that color is red.",1032393600,7,3522,4.609872611464968

291003,5,6300269477,"It was almost inevitable that following the detonation of the atomic bomb, a new sub-genre of B movies was created: the giant, nuclear-radiated-mutant-insect-antagonist.  Typical plots had the once lowly, insignificant creatures suddenly growing to enormous size where they not only loom over humans but prey on and symbolically punish them for what they have unleashed.  In other scenarios, the tiny creatures amass in a humongous swarm, and -- behaving as if with a single mind -- do battle with all life in its monstrous path.
Perhaps the best of the big bug lot is THEM (Warner Bros). Originally released in 1954 during the Eisenhower era, recent, not so subtle political and anti nuclear subtexts have been read into the giant ant attack plot that may not have been intended.  What starts in New Mexico with a child wandering in shock ends in a desperate man versus mad giant ant battle to the death in the 700 miles of storm drains under Los Angeles.  A great cast includes James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn and a truly heroic James Arness. No tongue in cheek wink-wink at the audience here.  Everything is played for real.
The screenplay by Ted Sherman is a model of energy, urgency and wit.  And breathtaking is the only way to describe the surprising visual quality of the DVD transfer that does justice to the atmospheric artistry of the B/W cinematography that does not shy away from wonderful, moody almost noirish night shots.

291054,5,6300269477,"I am a fool for old B&W horror and sci-fi movies and this is one of the best.  A tense, fastly paced drama staring Matt Dillion's James Arness ( he also played The Thing in The Thing )as an FBI investigator checking into the very mysterious death of an agent and his wife.  Helping in the investigation is the super James Whitmore.  Slowly the riddle begins to unfold with startling results, it is ants killing people in the middle of the desert.  But not the typical household pests, but monstrous ones capable of rippling apart buildings or sail vessels.
The acting is a dream, with taughtly written and directed pace.  Look for Fess Parker in a very small role as a man who sees the large ants and ends up in a mental ward because of it.
A must for any true fan of this genre!!",1030579200,,780,4.315068493150685

It has stood the test of time fairly well, although the special effects pale in comparison with today's capabilities, obviously. But still, the plot works, the script is still decent and the suspense is effective. Some things which I sensed didn't work when I first saw it still jar me. One example is that the uniforms of the troops in the last action sequence look like they just came from the cleaners, and James Arness' helmet liner (why did't they use the real thing?) looks a few sizes too small. But these are minor reservations. I still like this movie and the DVD production is all that could be asked of a 1950's black and white film. If you're hung up on DTS and computer animated graphics, you should probably pass on.

291056,4,6300269477,"Discover why the 1950s was a great decade for science fiction films with the amusing Sci-Fi classic ""Them!"". A series of gruesome and unexplained murders in the desert of New Mexico leads to the discovery of a colony of gigantic radiation-mutated ants. Created from the radioactive fallout from recent atomic bomb tests, these enormous beasts terrorize the populace and establish a thriving colony within the storm drains under Los Angeles. ""Them!"" was one of the first atomic monster features of the 1950s that spawned a whole generation of Sci-Fi films about giant radioactive creatures on the rampage. The storyline is well paced and builds to a satisfying climatic finish. This landmark classic became a big successful hit in its release in 1954 and features some effective special effects, good suspense and a brief cameo of a young Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek). The cast includes James Whitmore, Joan Weldon, James Arness, Fess Parker and Edmund Gwenn (Miracle on 34th Street).

""Them!"" is an absolute must-have for any serious fan of the Sci-Fi genre. This landmark 1950s creature feature is presented in its original full screen format. The picture quality is a big surprise. Its clean black and white video transfer is outstanding with little grain and visible dust. Its simple Dolby Digital 2.1 sound is enjoyable and well balanced. Its colorful interactive menus are very appealing and a big highlight in this presentation. Its special features include a short 3-minute behind-the-scenes footage, picture and photo gallery, the film's original theatrical trailer and outtakes on the design and operation of the giant mechanical ants. With its great viewing quality, ""Them!"" scores a ""B+"".",1029801600,,1696,5.25830258302583
291057,5,6300269477,"the very concept this film proposes is thought provoking. the mere idea of collossol ants threatening the survival of mankind is phenomenal. whether atomic radiation would actually cause such a mutation is irrelevant. this movie is worthy of honored recognition in the National Film Archives as one of the greatest sci-fi classics of the 1950s.
as for the DVD. excellent transfer. it just doesn't seem possible this 48 year old film could look this good. the special features are adequate( though a documentary on ants and their natural habitat would have complemented the DVD even more )and this DVD is imperative to anyone's library of film.",1029369600,,643,5.0754716981132075
291058,4,6300269477,"Finally, one of the best SciFi films made (for its time) has been transferred to DVD.  The picture quality is quite good and the sound (in Mono)transferred to my surround system in a surprisingly pleasing and 'non-shrill' manner.  It's still a scary, well acted movie and only loses one star simply because the special effects (the ants) don't measure up to today's standards.  But then, who cares!!!",1028851200,3,400,4.940298507462686
291059,4,6300269477,"My revised opinion:
Having the original DVD and the blu-ray, it's clear that this film has been zoomed (or ""hard matted) for the latest release. While this may have been the way it was projected in the 1950s, the bottom line is that the image is cropped. I prefer the open matte format of the DVD. Zooming this simply degrades the image quality. Some of the shots also look too tight on the vertical. IMO, they should have included both the open matte and cropped versions on this release. I believe in OAR, but not in this particular case (especially when it leads to a cropped and degraded image).

I'm ""updating"" my previous review of the DVD with observations about the blu-ray.

Yes, a cursory glance at the blu-ray does make it appear to be ""murky"" or ""soft"" or ""grainy"".
However if you really look, I believe that you will come to the same conclusion I did: the blu-ray is very good.
The DVD transfer used sharpening and digital noise reduction.
The blu-ray doesn't appear to have processed the image the same way. I think what we are seeing is closer to the way the film originally looked. You can always boost your contrast a bit. I usually watch movies in ""vivid"" mode (on a Panasonic Plasma) with the brightness turned down to around 50%. For ""Them!"" I tried watching it in ""cinema"" mode (which makes the image a bit smoother and warmer. It looks great.
So, my advise is to give it another look. I was initially disappointed too, but decided to relax and give it a chance.

True; it's not razor sharp, but since this is essentially an enlarged picture it looks pretty darn good. On my old 27"" CRT the DVD looked fantastic. When you blow those elements up for anamorphic, you are bound to get softer and grainier.

If you love the film, this is a no-brainer. I'm keeping the DVD since it's the way I originally saw the movie on TV. Plus the DVD had more ""fun"" interactive menu elements...
I can easily recommend this to fans of the genre.
..........................................................................................
This is a dream come true for fans of this film. The cover art is GREAT, having been adapted from the original poster art. The menus are fun, reading like sensationalistic newspaper headlines. The transfer ROCKS. I've never seen this film look so good. Detailed textures and fine contrast. Some nice extras with some rare test footage. I had misgivings when I saw the advanced images of the cover art, which depicted the old laser cover. Those misgivings are laid to rest! I am a happy camper! Wait...is that formic acid I smell?",1028678400,,2569,4.714922048997773
291060,5,6300269477,"This film is, in my opinion, the best of the classic 50's sci-fi films.  The other ""big bug"" films that came out during the same few years all pale in comparison with this one.
I think this film has the best acting of any of the genre, and with James Whitmore (the Miracle Grow guy) and Edmund Gwenn (Miracle on 34th Street) in the cast, this shouldn't be surprising.  If you look fast, you'll notice a young vulcan (Leonard Nimoy) running some equipment for the military.  Also given a cameo is Fess Parker (Old Yeller and Back to the Future).
The DVD features are about as good as you can expect for a film of this era. Most of the additional features are things like the TV trailers, which is pretty common. One thing I like about this particular DVD is the behind the scenes featurette. This is a very informative ""documentary"" that gives the viewer new insight into the making of the film, and the ants.
Now for the bad news.  The only drawback of this DVD edition, is that it is presented in full screen, not the original widescreen as produced in the 50's.  I always hate full screen versions, because I want to see the film as the producer and director originally released it.  This was my major complaint when I purchased ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"". Maybe they'll release these in widescreen someday, and I'll upgrade. Until then, I guess I'll have to get over it.",1028678400,3,1379,4.496
291061,4,6300269477,"I first recall seeing this movie many years ago on ""The Creature Double Feature"" out of Boston. The scariest moment for me has to be when one of our heroes is attacked by a sneaky ant in the ant's storm drain nest. After many years (and sleepless nights!), I have long since come to love this little gem.
While the idea of giant ants may seem silly, the film pulls it off with surprising flair. The ants are certainly a bit dated, but even so, they are just real enough to make the unbelievable believable. There's great suspense built up throughout, culminating in an ant beat-down beneath a major metropolitan city. One of the most famous action scenes in sci-fi film history occurs here when a giant ant crashes through a wall and attacks a ship's radio operator. One of our heroes even goes mano e mano with a giant ant in close-quarters combat when he's cut off from help by a cave-in. If you aren't on the edge of your seat by then, you must be comatose!
James Arness (Marshal Dillon on ""Gunsmoke"") plays FBI agent and hero Robert Graham. James Whitmore plays New Mexico police officer Ben Peterson, who first uncovers the mystery of the giant ants. Edmund Gwenn is probably best known to fans as Kris Kringle in the seminal holiday film ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Here, he plays a dottering old scientist who provides info on ants and their behavior.
There are some lighter moments despite the danger posed by the giant ants. Besides fun banter between the characters, Gwenn has an amusing encounter using a military radio, and later, unintentional comedy occurs when scientists mark giant ant sightings on a map using black flags (""Black Flag"" is the brand name of a popular insecticide).
For all of the wonderful extras and menu design, the fan of ""THEM!"" will be disappointed with the lack of behind-the-scenes info on the film. For example, some production notes explaining that the film was originally supposed to be shot in Technicolor, but could not be due to the high cost would have been nice (the title card is in blazing red, the only use of color in the film). Also, information on the special coloring of the ant props in anticipation of the Technicolor shoot would have been informative (they were painted red and green). There are few if any behind the scenes shots showing how the ants were operated, which would have been nice. I have to go with four stars due to the lack of more info on the film, but the transfer is tack sharp, and the ants sound as spooky as ever (no info on the sound effects in the extras, either).
There are a surprising number of known faces in this film besides Mr. Gwenn, Mr. Whitmore, and Mr. Arness. Leonard Nimoy, forever famous as Mr. Spock on ""Star Trek"" has an early role here, walking on as a radio man who discusses a ""flying saucer"" sighting with a secretary. Also look for Fess Parker of Davy Crockett fame as the pilot who reports the giant ant-shaped ""saucers"". The well-known character actor William Schallert pops up as an ambulance attendant. Schallert appeared in countless cameos in television and films, and is probably best known for playing Patty Duke's father on ""The Patty Duke Show"". You may also spot Dub Ta ylor as a railway guard. Taylor was a staple of western films, and he's sure to be familiar. If you look quick, you'll also spot Richard Deacon, who went on to play Mel Cooley, the uptight producer (and target for Morey Amsterdam's jokes), on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".
""THEM!"" is a landmark sci-fi/horror film, and set the standard by which all other giant radiation-mutated bug movies must be judged by. You'll never quite look at ants again in the same way after watching this film. The effects are still good even today, and the ants can still creep you out despite being fifty years old!",1028592000,33,3773,4.624441132637854
291062,4,6300269477,"This DVD version of THEM! is far superior to the VHS version.

very strong.  This DVD has the worst menu system I've ever seen.

291093,5,6300269477,"A home in the New Mexico desert has been destroyed and all that remains is a catatonic little girl (Sandy Descher) who says nothing and reacts to nothing until suddenly in the hospital she starts screaming ""Them! THEM! THEM!"" The scene justifies the rather interesting use of a pronoun as the title for this science fiction monster movie from the 1950s. Those who have trouble remembering this title usually can still recall the film when you tell them this is the one with the giant ants.
""Them!"" divides neatly into two parts. The first half, where our cast of characters are confronted with the mystery of what is happening in the desert, is the best part of the film, creating a nice sense of tension as the clues that make no sense begin to add up to something quite unbelievable. But we know that this is 1950s black & white science fiction and the rule of thumb is once you actually see the monster a film quickly loses steam. The ants are basically a cross between giant puppets and giant marionettes. The thrills and chills come not so much from seeing the giant bugs as it does from the eerie sounds the ants make that are pretty much targeted right for your spine. Still, these special effects are not as laughable as, say, throwing grasshoppers on photographs of Chicago skyscrapers. The second half of the film becomes a search and destroy mission where you have to go along with the idea that a colony of giant ants can get from the area of New Mexico where the first A-bomb was exploded to below Los Angeles without anybody noticing. But then you remember this is a movie about ants the size of elephants and your curtail your complaints regarding your willingness to suspend disbelief.
I have long considered ""Them!"" and ""The Thing From Another World"" to be linked ideologically, as well as by the presence of James Arness, who is the heroic FBI Agent Robert Graham in the former and the carrot monster in the latter. The two films are linked ideologically basically by being opposite. In ""The Thing"" the military has to save the world from the scientist who wants to study the strange visitor from another planet and considers sacrificing a few human beings to satisfying the monster's blood lust a small price to pay for the advancement of science. However, in ""Them!"" the military looks to the scientist to not only understand what is going on but how to proceed with hunting down and destroying the nests of giant ants. After all, Edmund Gwenn as Dr. Harold Medford might not be playing Kris Kringle this time around but he is still a kindly grandfather type with no thought of sacrificing anyone to these atomic mutants. Consequently, there is no conflict about what to do, just how to go about doing it as quickly as possible (the image of James Whitmore using a tommy gun to take down the first giant ant seems more appropriate to a pre-war gangster flick).
I would think that at some point Hollywood might get around to remaking ""Them!"", although I would think the ants would work a lot better if they were smaller but more numerous (I am thinking something along the lines of ""Starship Troopers"" type numbers of ants pretty much doing the scarab thing from the recent ""Mummy"" movies). If they were the size of dogs or cats they could still do serious damage to anything that got in their way. Even if there were only 10 times bigger than normal, a couple hundred of them would give audience members the wiggens before they actually started stripping some poor slob down to the bone.
Another thing I have noticed is that many of these 1950s science fiction classics have some of the smartest damsels in distress you have ever seen.  Witness Joan Weldon as Dr. Patricia ""Pat"" Medford, out there in the desert helping her father fight the good fight.  It is as if Hollywood was going out of its way not to emulate the stereotype perpetuated on dozens and dozens of science fiction pulp magazine covers over the first half of the 20th century. There is still screaming from time to time, but a lot less fainting.",1027987200,12,4033,4.623430962343096
291094,5,6300269477,"""THEM"" will have you on the edge of your seat from the opening scene. The cast, especially James Whitmore and James Arness, perform with steely eyed seriousness. The plot of mutation by nuclear blast in well worn, but has never been executed so convincingly.
""THEM"" begins with a series of unsolved disappearances. The only
witness being a five year old child suffering from severe shock. Piece by piece the plot is realistically unfolded before the viewer, and we soon learn of the monster ants for which the movie is named.
The intense and rapidly moving chain of events encompass the geographic area between rural Texas and Los Angeles, with the transitions from place to place made smoothly, without the confusion which seem to plague more modern productions.
Although the special effects are dated, and the scientific facts used to convey the story might by a little inaccurate, the great performances more than make the movie.
Instead of squandering fortunes remaking bombs like ""THE BLOB"" and ""INVADERS FROM MARS"", Hollywood moguls should combine high tech special effects and a great story line and remake ""THEM"".",1027814400,3,1121,5.0978260869565215

291098,5,6300269477,"Certainly,THEM, is one of the best post-WWII big bug movies ever made. When it was released, the memories of the Second World War were quite fresh in the minds of American audiences. What they saw was not only a movie that combined snappy dialogue, male bonding (James Whitmore & James Arness), low key romance (Arness & Joan Weldon), father/daughter give and take (Edmund Gwynn & Weldon), and several comic flourishes (Fess Parker as a crazed pilot), but what made this movie click was that the enemy, the giant mutated ants, were presented in the same way that Hollywood showed the evil-grinning, buck-toothed Japs of the previous decade. These ants appeared out of nowhere in a surprise assault on a desert camper (read Pearl Harbor) with only an incoherent survivor, a little girl, to warn America about the dangers of 'them.' The warnings placed out on the police radio and on television are remarkably reminiscent of FDR's 'Day of Infamy' speech.  As on December 8, 1941, when America could see and hear the destruction wrought by the Japanese in the South Pacific, so too could the same audience a dozen years later be reminded graphically that though the times and faces on the enemy may change, there exists in this unfeeling world a vicious enemy that cannot be reasoned with nor can be deterred from their purpose.  All that Americans can do is get in the final kayo punch.
  After the ants have escaped from the desert to take roost in the hold of a navy steamer, there is a graphic and horrifying scene in which marauding ants are seen as breaking into the radio room, killing the seamen who are using their lives to buy time to morse code the message that ants have broken into the radio room. It is impossible to view this scene without being aware of how on some level this valiant morse coding does not remind one of a similarly valiant morse coding performed by some nameless sailor as the Japs were breaking in the radio rooms of Wake Island and Corregidor.
  And then there is the war against the ants in the underground sewers of Los Angeles.  The eerie silence that preceeds the ants' attack on the US soldiers brings to mind the storming of the beaches at Tarawa.  It is no surprise, then, that this movie resonated with the minds of Americans who were weary of the horrors of the Second World War and then had to face further oriental killers in Korea. Even today, as I see Whitmore and Arness blast their way through a horde of mindless ants, I am reminded of other and earlier documentaries that showed these marauders as non-insects, but nonetheless equally as threatening and just as worthy as being squashed under the jackboots of American soldiers.",1019606400,2,2678,4.6950959488272925

291100,5,6300269477,"Whenever someone mentions 50's sci-fi films,the first thing that comes to mind is the giant bug movies. Well,this is the best to come out of that era.
This movie sets itself apart by not following the trends of the time. You won't see any shots of someone waiving there hands in front of their face while the camera slowly desends on them. The lead female is also treated as an equal,rather then walking around serving the other men coffee or becoming an instant nursemaid the minute someone injures themselves.
The ants are actually quite impressive. Other than the fact that they look to be floating across the ground I was unable to spot any strings. I was happy they opted not to show the flying ants. I don't think they could have pulled it off without it looking cheezy.
The acting was good from top to bottom. It helps that the film had such an intellegent script. The pacing is just right so that you never get bored and the characters behaved realistically to the fact that their nemisis' were giant ants. Thankfully,the script didn't include a tacked on romance which never seems believable and usually slows down these types of films.
You really cant go wrong with this movie. In fact,even if you don't like 50's sci-fi films,you'll probably stilll enjoy this one. Theres even a suprize death!!Hows THAT for a teaser?",1012348800,4,1328,4.703862660944206
291101,5,6300269477,"Yes, the special effects are very much of the 1950s, but those effects are fun to watch--and unlike most other 1950s sci-fi/horror films, THEM! has a lot more going for it than special effects alone: sharp and aggressive performances, a cast of truly memorable supporting actors, a witty and intelligent script, and best of all (unlike many other films of its era) a story that can still generate plenty of suspense.

The grand-daddy of all mutant-monster movies, THEM! concerns a colony of A-Bomb-created giant ants that have lurked in the desert unnoticed until the colony begins to divide.  When newborn queen ants take flight, the world is in danger--particularly Los Angeles, where a nest establishes itself in the city's largely forgotten storm drains.  Edmund Gwynne and Joan Weldon give strong performances as the father-daughter scientific team sent from Washington to investigate, and James Whitmore and James Arness give able support as the action-heros of the piece.  Fess Parker is also very effective in a small supporting role.

The real winner in the film, however, is the clever cinematography and sound effects that build tremendous suspense, particularly when investigators must enter the desert ant nest and later track the ants to their Los Angeles lair.  These scenes possess a claustrophobic feel not seen again in any sci-fi/horror flick until ALIEN.  Without graphic gore but more than a few serious thrills, THEM! is a film the whole family can enjoy.

From the ominously rumbling piano glissandos that are played over the Warner Brothers logo at the beginning to its fiery finale, ""Them"" is a taut, tense doomsday prophecy on the monstrous results of nuclear testing. ""Them"" is, of course, THE 50s classic about giant ants, the result of nuclear testing in the Arizona desert. Director Gordon Douglas handled the film as if it were a crime drama, as opposed to the hysterical, comic-book treatment that this genre is usually treated. Filmed in  noirish black-and-white, with a strong cast, an extremely literate script (someone did their homework about ants and their behavior), an effectively chilling score by Bronislau Kaper, and a memorable sound effect for the giant ants, ""Them!"" is a memorable science fiction nightmare. I may also add that lovely Joan Weldon, who plays an entomologist, is very believeable-she doesn't look like a ""Miss Florida Grapefruit"" contest winner leaning her 38DDs over a microscope. Detractors of this film kvetch about how ""fake"" the giant ants look in this film-give me a break! If you can get past the fact that these are mechanical ants (in 1955, long before computer-generated special effects), enjoy the film-It won't hurt, honest! In closing, I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a literate, spine-tingling sci-fi thriller with a good storyline and performances, as opposed to a loud, special-effects-packed cinematic theme-park ride.

This film has it all, a wonderful script, great acting and above all, atmosphere.  It's a film that once viewed, it will never be forgotten.

291158,5,6300269477,"My 3 1/2 year old son loves this show.  He saw it 3 times during the 1st week end we got it.  He calls it the ""bug show"" and enjoys seeing it again and again.  Parts were a little scary for him -- he would hide behind a chair and peek over the arms. This is one of his all-time favorite shows.  Of course, I like it too.  That's why I wanted to share it with my children.  It is a classic in the Science Fiction genre.  The story is developed at a good pace, building suspense.  Not many Sci Fi shows include children. This one has a child in the beginning and 2 children at the end. I think this makes it easier for kids to connect with this show. It is a good introduction to classic science fiction for kids.",980035200,,711,3.9577464788732395
291159,5,6300269477,"Arguably, the original and the best of the ""genetic mutation by A-Bomb"" movies that surfaced during the 1950's...""Them"" can still send a chill down the spine today !
Convincing acting, a creative script, solid dialogue and an eerie musical score contribute to a film that is still viewed today as an intelligent and well made science fiction thriller. The plot of course is fairly well known....destruction and death are occurring in the New Mexico desert and state troopers are amazed to find out that ants mutated by atomic testing have grown to mammoth proportions. James Whitmore & James Arness lead the charge to halt the spread of these beasts and Edmund Gwenn, as dithering entomology expert Dr. Medford, lends his scientific mind to stopping the horror.
Excellent use of both desert and city locations...especially throughout the Los Angelas storm water drains...make this an unnerving and spine tingling adventure. The special effects are a little dated...but it is nearly 50 years ago !!
If you love classic / cult sci-fi....then ""THEM"" belongs on your shelf !!",975974400,69,1071,5.1257142857142854
291160,5,6300269477,"Gordon Douglas triumphs with his directorial work in ""Them!"", the quintessential giant monster-on-the loose movie. Extremely well paced and taughtly directed, ""Them!"" boasts an eerie, moody atmosphere that permeates the film. This movie has been so well made that it rises above its surprisingly unconvincing special effects and pulp science fiction roots and becomes a classic of the genre. Director Douglas has fashioned a stripped-down movie that sets a powerful mood without wasting a single frame of film. His characters are very believable and well developed.
The film opens in the eerie, lonely, wind swept Joshua-tree forests around Victorville, California, substituting for the New Mexico desert in the White Sands region. A police car comes across a lone little girl in the desert who, deep in shock, can only shout ""Them!"". Soon the police officers discover the wreckage of a lone trailer where the girl resided. What follows is more a detective story than anything else, with the menace of the giant ants being slowly revealed. Gordon Douglas handles the exposition of these ants so well that it is very easy to suspend disbelief. A certain sense of repulsive, uneasy wonder develops throughout the film and climaxes very effectively in the storm drains and sewers of Los Angeles, where the ants make their final stand.
The movie begins and ends with a theme of children being threatened, from the little girl who has one of the first encounters with the ants to the two little boys who are trapped in the storm drains with the ants at the end of the film. Normally, I find using threatened children as a plot device to be a cheap way to build audience sympathy, but here it is so well handled and tastefully done that I wasn't bothered by it.
Music and especially the sound effects are all equally well handled, becoming contributors to the highly effective whole that is ""Them!"". See this movie and see the craft of well made story telling at its best.
The video transfer is very competent and crisply done. The glorious black-and-white print used in the tranfer is clean with no obvious splices. The sound, though mono only, is clean and clear.",973555200,17,2159,4.917808219178082
291161,5,6300269477,"Them! is a great movie - solidly entertaining all the way through. The premise seems cliched, but this is the source of all the inferior imitations that followed, and when you see the original you will understand why so many wanted to rip it off! In the desert of New Mexico, gigantic ANTS are discovered to be the result of nuclear testing. Thus begins this insect extravaganza extraordinaire. This is a great movie for kids especially, but adults will probably get a kick out of it too. Don't worry - it won't disappoint.",971568000,,523,4.634408602150538

Love to see it on DVD someday. Maybe some audio commentary  from James Whitmore telling us his memories about making this film and with  working along side Edmund Gwenn.

291183,5,6300269477,"I remember this movie as being the first one that I saw that featured atomic created mutations.  The scenario that this could possibly happen seemed all too real considering what we didn't know about atomic energy at  that time.  (Still not real sure that is couldn't happen.)  The most  memorable part of this movie was the strange high pitched sound that the  giant ants made when they were communicating, and the little girl that  survived the attack that killed her parents.  The sequence where she utters  ""Them!"" with her eyes so wide and scared was unforgettable.
I  love these kind of movies and, lovingly, refer to them as classic B-movies.  I will watch them over and over again, just like visiting an old  friend.
I would recommed this movie to anyone who enjoys creature  features and hope that they would be as entertained as I have been over the  last 30 or more years.",962928000,3,883,4.64935064935065

Either Gordon Douglas hadn't learned that early Sci-Fi meant 'B' movies or he just didn't  care.  The result is a true Science Fiction classic, one of the most  frightening films ever put on celluloid.  Them! combines competent acting  by a superior cast, including James Arness and James Whitmore, with solid  effects and just enough scientific credibility to make it easy for viewers  to suspend their disbelief.  These critters are not bullet-proof, they're  not superintelligent, they're just too bloody big for any self-respecting  ant, and therein lies more than enough trouble.
