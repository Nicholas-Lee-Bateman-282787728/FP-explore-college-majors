Before I knew who Rocket Ismail was I saw him run down the sidelines at blazing speed on a punt return.  There are incredible plays (obviously) and it is a great way to acclimate children to football.  I still remember this video vividly even though I haven't seen it in decades.  I want to dig it up and watch it again, but since it is only vhs, the quality won't be great and won't have the longevity of a dvd.",1438992000,,514,4.0
