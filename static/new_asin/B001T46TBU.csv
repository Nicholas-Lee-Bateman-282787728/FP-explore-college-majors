8340465,5,B001T46TBU,A wonderful movie!!! Tells the story of how a drug dealer has too lose everything (financially & almost everything else) in order to find out what was really important in  his life. ABSOLUTELY 5 STARS!! People that do not like this movie are the same morons who have to have shoot em up bang bang every 5 minutes to stay focused!!!,1470528000,,331,4.426229508196721
