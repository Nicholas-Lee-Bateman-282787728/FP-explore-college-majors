8577458,5,B00C5TCVY2,"This is an excellent way to spend roughly nine hours relaxing to ""some"" of my roughly twelve thousand Trippy Fractals.  All-in-all I have ninety-one-thousand fractals that are separate from the sixteen-thousand-eight-hundred-thousand VJ Loops.  I wanted to write an update that I no longer operate my old web site ""allfractup"" or use the licensed phrase of ""All Fract Up"".  I have seen some people scamming others by charging $60+ dollars (excluding shipping fees) to buy copies of these DVDs.  Why do that when you can get them right here off Amazon who makes them on-demand for each order that is placed?  And, the best part is you'll pay a whole lot less when you buy it from Amazon.

You can buy ChromaDepth 3D glasses directly from the manufacturer at American Paper Optics.",1488758400,,779,4.908396946564886
