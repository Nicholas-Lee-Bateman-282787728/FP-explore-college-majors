7945088,5,B00005M207,Two of the earliest Hoppy films which are great entertainment.  The highlight are the original Paramount titles in both features.  These are the restored films from the U. S. Television Office.  It's just disgraceful the way they put a copyright notice superimposed on the main title.  It just ruins the beautiful look of the title card.,1294185600,3,337,4.964285714285714
7945089,5,B00005M207,"This is one of the best action Hopalong Cassidy movies there is it is.  There was some work that went into it's production.

I have several of these Early Years dvds.  One thing I have noticed about some of these Image Entertainment Hopalong Cassidy discs, including this one, is that some of them have flaws, dvd players have trouble reading them in a spot or two or more.  It's worst on some dvd players than others.  I would really know if this is common.",1175472000,,458,4.404761904761905
7945090,5,B00005M207,"William Boyd is introduced to us as the ever popular western hero Hopalong Cassidy in this 1935 double feature DVD.  This DVD series has been meticulously digitally reproduced both in picture & sound. Black & White and Standard Picture (before WideScreen).
William Boyd and Paramount Pictures made over 60 Big Screen Hopalong movies.  Many old time western stars were introduced in this very popular western series including Hoppy's sidekick George ""Gabby"" Hayes as Windy.
Once again enjoy the 1930's most popular cowboy tame the west and win our hearts on this new DVD series.  The picture quality and the stories are truly fun stuff.
In summary:  The first 1935 movie (60 minutes) ""Hop-a-long Cassidy"" introduces us to this western hero & how Bill Cassidy the foreman on the famous Bar 20 ranch got his name, Hop-a-long.  The story generally is about cattle rustlers and feuding ranchers.  Hoppy comes to the rescue.  Great action sequences climaxes this tale.  The second 1935 feature (63 minutes) ""Bar 20 Rides Again"" has Hoppy coming to the rescue of an old friend whos being forced off his land by a nefarious villian.
This is truly fun stuff and even today holds up as a great western hero.  William Boyd is Hopalong Cassidy.  For over 60 Movies he was our hero & now once again because of film preservation and this restored digital DVD we can escape to old west.  Great package and family entertainment.
Hoppy was and still is my favorite cowboy of all time.  The only cowboy who rode a white stallion (named ""Topper""), wore 2 silver six shooters, wore all black, never drank, smoked, was always a gentleman and tried to solve situations peacefully.  Imagine that for a role model!!!  He was mine.  Enjoy.",1027641600,29,1714,4.841924398625429
7945091,5,B00005M207,"Paramount Pictures and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character ""Hopalong Cassidy"" comes to life through the producing of Harry ""Pop"" Sherman and the realistic performance of William Lawrence Boyd...as Hoppy aims to do some trailing for cattle rustlers, clean up a wild town and save the under-dog...always filmed in the great outdoors of Lone Pine, California at the foothills of Mount Whitney.
Great Cast of Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson) always hot-headed & getting into trouble...but the scene stealer is George ""Gabby"" Hayes, as the old-timer Uncle Ben, gives the a film shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, as the father figure to Hoppy the interaction with Boyd's character is pure Americana!
Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and your grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome fun...when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play.
