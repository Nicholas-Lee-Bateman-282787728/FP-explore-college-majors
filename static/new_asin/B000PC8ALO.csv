8556968,3,B000PC8ALO,This DVD is a bit misleading. I love learning about all the royal families around the world but of course like many royal watchers my favorites are the Windsors of Great Britain. This DVD has Prince William and Prince Harry on the cover but it actually talks more about an african royal family that I knew nothing about. I watched it for the educational value but it was a bit disappointing simply because I didn't get what i thought i was getting. It was just ok as far as I was concerned.,1275004800,7,490,4.336956521739131
