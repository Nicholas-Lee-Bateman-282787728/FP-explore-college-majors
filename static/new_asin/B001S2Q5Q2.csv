8339373,5,B001S2Q5Q2,"I can't believe some of the people who wrote the negative reviews.
This is PART 1 of a multi-part documentary series. It clearly
stated in the description that this DVD only covered the recently
bulldozed portions of Cypress Gardens (when it was known as
Cypress Gardens Adventure Park).

Seriously, if the negative reviewers ACTUALLY READ THE ABOVE
DESCRIPTION -- and wanted the DVD with the botanical gardens
or ski show, they should have bought VOLUME 2.  But instead,
they complained relentlessly because they bought the wrong
DVD.

Overall, the picture quality is top notch. Like all the other
documentaries produced by this production company, there is no
narration. However, the DVD is subtitled with lots of different
facts about the park (saying basically what a narrator would say).

Bottom line, this DVD is really the only thing we have left of
Cypress Gardens ""Adventure Park"". Its a good way to see the
roller coasters, thrill rides and animal exhibits as they once
were (as the park was operated from 2004 - 2008).  If that's
what you are looking for, then you'll like it.  If not, wait
for Volume 2.

This is the only way to see Cypress Gardens currently -- as it
is now a closed and defunct attraction (Its not like there are a ton
of other Cypress Gardens videos to chose from).  If you want to
see the park as it once was -- you'll love this DVD.",1249257600,2,1365,4.658333333333333
8339374,2,B001S2Q5Q2,"I thought this video would be a nice memento of my recent trip to Cypress Gardens. Unfortunately, almost the entire video (produced in 2009) was about the short-lived ""adventure park"" that was being torn down when I visited the park in June, 2009. The video offers almost no coverage of the still-wonderful gardens, which have always been the heart of the park. The movie does have some great roller coaster shots, but the roller coasters had all been shut down by the time I visited the park.

Perhaps there's a Volume 2 that covers the actual gardens, but it wasn't available at Amazon.",1247616000,2,588,4.70873786407767
8339375,2,B001S2Q5Q2,"For a documentary, this was little more than a tourist video with musical background. Nothing about the water sky shows, the flower ladies. Not one word of dialogue. Don't waste your money.",1245196800,2,189,4.9375
