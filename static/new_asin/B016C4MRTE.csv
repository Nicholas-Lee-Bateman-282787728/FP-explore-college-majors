8736252,2,B016C4MRTE,"There are 3 areas to look at with regards to a DVD box set. The material recorded on the DVD, the quality of the DVD pressing, and the box it all comes in. First off, Chicago Hope is one of the best shows ever on TV. The cast is great, and the stories are well written. The only complaint is it sometimes is a bit over-produced, turning out to be too slick for it's own good. A minor issue. As for the quality of the pressing, I was somewhat disappointed. There were too many scenes where the lighting was too dark, making it hard to see what was going on. Plus the sound was low quite often, and there were some complete episodes that sounded like they were recorded in a tin box. Really bad. As for the packaging, it would be safe to say that this is the hands down the WORST ever. I don't know where to begin. First off, all you get with the box are the DVD's. There's no booklet, no episode listing, no story information, just the DVD's. Some of the cast photos on the DVD's are incorrect, and the six seasons are divided into 2 holders, both of which are noted on the back of each as holding the DVD's for the first 3 seasons. The kicker is the 2 holders themselves. The DVD's are crammed into each DVD on top of DVD. When you open it, DVD's fall out every time. One of the hinges on box 1 was broken when I opened it, as they are very fragile, holding too many DVD's each. It is VERY difficult to take out DVD's to watch them, you have to remove DVD's to watch other DVD's. The person who designed this box should never be allowed to again. Just thinking about the packaging annoys me and offsets most of what I like. One look and you would see what I mean. I took all the DVD's and put them plastic holders and put them in a small box. The fact is the box the show comes in you don't really need. All it has is a couple of photos which you can remove and put with the DVD's. In short, great show, okay DVD quality(it's 20th century TV), and absolutely terrible (WORST EVER - a 2 year old could do better) packaging.",1492560000,7,2022,4.095717884130982
