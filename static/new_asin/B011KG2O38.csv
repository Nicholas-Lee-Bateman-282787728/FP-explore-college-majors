7333650,5,B011KG2O38,"Casino Royale is the best modern 007 movie in my view. Skyfall is in second place and shows that Craig is a good Bond. However, the only reason he is not great is Quantum of Solace.",1498176000,2,181,4.055555555555555

7333657,5,B011KG2O38,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching Daniel Craig, the ""Blonde Bond"", in action. As we all know, all of our James Bond actors have been handsome dark haired devils.  In my opinion it was a nice change for them to find an actor who looked a bit different, but was completely as great in the part as the other actors were.  I am a great one for wanting the ""whole"" story about our film heroes and these films definitely laid the foundation. It was refreshing to see him fall in love.  In my opinion the other films seemed to make him a womanizing romeo.  In these films you actually saw him as his heart was broken again and again.  Thanks Amazon for making it possible for me to indulge myself with these films.",1479081600,6,703,4.33587786259542
7333658,5,B011KG2O38,Daniel Craig is by far the second best 007...only behind Sean. These movies are good enough that you'll want to watch them again and again. Only thing bad about the set is it's missing the final film and you'll have to purchase it separately.,1478995200,5,242,4.5227272727272725
7333659,5,B011KG2O38,"Daniel Craig is the best Bond to date. He personifies the ultimate spy genre to a 'T'. Part macho thug, part urbane gamester, part wily adversary, with the hidden hints of a heart that wants real love.

Casino Royale is the best Bond movie I've seen. Truly credible plot, masterful, rather than cartoony,  villains,  the wonderful Dame Judy Dench as M, and a gorgeously tragic heroine. Wonderful action sequences, and beautifully shot.

The other 2 movies in the collection are good too. Ian Fleming wrote juicy villains,  but a bit shallow on the women, though screen writers have tried to make them more than cardboard cutout seductresses with weaponry.

Thoroughly enjoyable spy capers.",1476748800,4,689,5.053097345132743

7333679,4,B011KG2O38,"Craig James Bond set very nice indeed, 3 movies for 17 dollars and all 3 movies played in my dvd player.  I will admit though Skyfall had a small moment where it had a hipcup in the playing for 4 seconds and rest of the movie played great so I am not worried about a few seconds hipcup as long as rest plays fine.  As for the 3 movies themselves very nice locations, exotic scenes, and amazing stunts and action scenes that will make your jaw drop open when watching these movies.  I don't agree he is a the best Bond because of the other Bond movies I have had the pleasure of watching during my lifetime.  Still he is pretty good at the role, still have to watch the 4th movie of his that just came out on dvd.  But in closing if your looking for 3 great Bond movies full of excitment, action scenes, and exotic locations then pick these movies up for a great price of 17 dollars or least that is what I payed for them.",1459641600,2,921,4.094444444444444
