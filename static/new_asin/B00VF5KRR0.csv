8709930,5,B00VF5KRR0,"A Haunting has been one of my favorites since the pilot, 'A Haunting in Connecticut' premiered back in 2002 and was disappointed when the show was canceled in 2007 after four excellent seasons. (The show was later renewed in 2012 by Destination America.)

I was pretty excited to find A Haunting-Ghost and Demons. The cover art is pretty cool and I was thinking these were new episodes. No Such Luck. The four episodes in this set: Ghost Soldier, Hungry Ghosts, Demon Child, and Where Demons Dwell are creepy. They are presented in 1.33 full frame and spread across two dvds. This would be great except all the episodes are from the previously released Season Two.

So BEWARE! If you own the Season One and Two Box Set, there is no reason to spend your money on this. This might be good as an inexpensive gift for someone but If you don't own any of A Haunting Sets, I'd recommend buying the season sets that over this sampler.",1469232000,,927,4.544910179640719
