659117,5,6303422136,"I loved this movie. For those who were captivated by Jennifer Jason-Leigh's over-the-top performance in The Hudsucker Proxy, Mrs Parker is a must-see movie. JJL wears a bob and a cloche hat like nobody else. Her  dialogue is not, as some have said, incomprehensible, but simply a  marvellous re-rendering of that fabulously affected clipped New England  style favoured by street-wise New Yorkers of the period, as essential to  the production as the wardrobe. See this movie and then read The Great  Gatsby, or, even better, Butterfield 8. The books will then come alive. I  particularly liked the way black and white was used for the 'flash-forward'  sequences, and colour for her more colourful, happier past in the twenties,  unlike the opposite method which is usually used. A movie with great style  and earnest attention to period detail - It's got me reading Dorothy  Parker's poetry, whereas before seeing this movie I knew nothing about her.",944870400,30,950,5.070967741935484
659118,4,6303422136,"Jennifer Jason Leigh's portrayal of the exceptionally clever, witty and vunerable Dorothy Parker is nothing short of acting genius. Ms. Leigh' understanding of this complex woman is uncanny. The use of black &  white sequences to counterpoint the colorful heyday of the Algonquin Round  Table is a nice touch. This is a film to watch again and again.",940464000,11,350,5.017241379310345

The film is at best a dark vision of the life of a writer, yet it sheds light on that shadowy  modernist, Dorothy Parker.  A jab at feminism, a poke at Hollywood and a  swig off the cocktails of New York all make this one of the greatest  sleepers of all time.  The mournful soudtrack, the slurred voice of Mrs.  Parker and the poetic zingers all make the film a literary masterpiece-- on  film! Michael J. Bacon

659347,2,6303422136,"This could be Exhibit A for a ""Details Movie,"" the kind of movie that goes to great lengths to get all the details right about clothing, decor, cars, etc, but has no narrative pull and no characters who are likable or engaging.  For starters, the lead character's dialogue is mostly inaudible (yes, my hearing is just fine, thank you), so if you choose to watch this (not recommended), keep the remote handy with your thumb on the volume control, because you'll need to max your speakers out to catch Dorothy Parker's muttered/mumbled/fumbled dialogue, whereas the others actor's dialogue comes through loud and clear (not that it's particularly interesting).  But don't bother, because nothing she says is worth hearing, and her renowned ""witticisms"" have been hugely overrated (you'd get more guffaws from any episode of Cheers than from everything Dorothy Parker ever wrote).  I was interested in this movie not because of Parker but because the leading male character, Robert Benchley, was one of the great American humorists, funny in both his essays and his short films, and infinitely more clever than Parker.  However, the movie never depicts Benchley saying anything even remotely funny (his famous ""Treasurer's Report"" standup piece is dead as a doornail as presented by actor Campbell Scott).  So in this telling, Parker isn't funny, Benchley isn't funny, and their lunchtime pals, the famous Algonquin Round Table, are neither witty nor particularly vicious, so the story ends up hanging on the neurotic Parker's promiscuity, and will she ever jump into bed with her longtime pal Benchley (spoiler: they don't, and you shouldn't care).  Actor Tom McGown does resemble the pudgy, bespectacled critic Alexander Woollcott, but Wollcott's notoriously wicked putdowns didn't make it into the script.  The externals of the world they inhabited are recreated in loving detail, but the dialogue is utterly lifeless, and by the time Parker gets around to her suicide attempt (in real life, there was more than one), you'll be wishing she succeeded.

I'm being generous in giving this thing two stars, since any movie that can make the fabulous Robert Benchley look boring has a lot to answer for.  If you've ever seen Benchley, he always wore a lovable, impish smile, but you'd never guess that from watching this.  Skip this movie and curl up with a collection of Benchley's essays.  They're a lot more life-affirming than this depressing exploration into the sex life of neurotic woman, played by an actress who delivers her dialogue like someone who received a megadose of novocaine.",1426464000,2,2589,5.140476190476191

659521,5,6303422136,"Biographies are a tricky thing to bring to film, more so than in novels, but director Alan Parker has done a superb job of illuminating the lives of Dorothy Parker and her 1920s Algonquin bon vivants. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a career defining performance as Parker, vividly displaying the unique mix of acerbic wit, dark impulses and drive for love that made Parker one of the 20th century's most iconic figures. To its credit the film doesn't shy away from both Parker's internal demons nor the restlessness and ennui below the surface of these famed intellectuals. The cast is first rate. Campbell Scott gives a star-making turn as Parker's soul mate, Robert Benchley. Their relationship is at the heart of the film and Leigh and Campbell are magnetic when they're on screen. Add Matthew Broderick as the cad that Parker loses her heart to, Wallace Shawn as the Algonquin waiter who devises the idea for the round table, Lily Taylor nailing the enigmatic Edna Furber plus a young Gywneth Paltrow and Heather Graham, and there is plenty of star power to hold the viewer's attention. The sets and costumes are spot on but in the end it's the writing, and more importantly the editing, that are front and center here. These NY luminaries may not have been as witty as they are portrayed here but the dizzying pace of their quips is a sheer joy. There are so many great ""throw-away"" one liners that you have have to see the film a second time to catch them all. You'll want to anyway, to pay more attention to Leigh's nuanced performance. Alan Parker took a risk in using a stylized manner of speaking for Ms. Parker and even more of a risk in having her occasionally recite her poetry directly to the camera but both work, in fact add another layer to the film.
This is a very funny film in parts, not just the one liners, especially for those who love witty repartee among more fully realized characters than we see in many films. And yet Dorothy Parker herself doesn't hide from the viewer the turmoil of her life and there are places where Parker's devastating honesty really pins you to your seat. Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle isn't just for Parker fans, for it accomplishes that rare trick of giving us a window into American history while being so damn enjoyable that even at a full two hours you find yourself wishing there was more.",1375574400,,2348,4.633093525179856
659522,3,6303422136,"Jennifer Jason Leigh was almost impossible to understand, but her acting was good.  She mumbled all of her lines.  I have liked her in some other films, so she knows how to speak.  If she was mimicking Dorothy Parker's voice, it still could have been more clear, to further the movie.  Campbell Scott was outstanding.",1374624000,,317,4.709090909090909

The Marx Bros and Dorothy Parker---imagine recording some of their encounters,there'd have been a lifetime of laughs.

Mrs. Parker was not a very happy woman to begin with.  Her poetry attests to that.  She understandably surrounded herself with people who were quite remote on purpose and set herself up only once in the film, all to come toppling down. This ""vicious"" group was a bit like the community of Hollywood actors who have trouble deciding what's real from the artifice.  Their remoteness was ""safe"" for them although probably not particularly rewarding in any personal way.

Sometimes during the film I wondered if the color scheme should be reversed.  The recitations of Parker's poems should have been in color and the repartee in black and white.  Of course that would never sell...

659526,3,6303422136,"i would have loved to give this film five stars, but then it would have had to have been made with another actress in the lead role.

i love the period, the writers depicted, the algonquin club, the direction, the production design, in fact almost everything about the film (including jennifer jason leigh's look) - but every time i have suffered through it i come up against her muttered and slurred speech, along with her totally manneristic enunciation.  she really ruined the film for me.

as another writer said here, parker deserves much better than this.  the rest of the cast is admirable, and i might have given it a higher score if the film had subtitles or at least ccaptioning.  but to take away the voice of this american icon known for her unique voice is to wreck the whole concept of the film.  someone should stop all residuals to leigh for this film (and give her a stern talking-to).

in fact, i am surprised that allan rudolph, who has directed some really great films, allowed her to turn in this garbled and inarticulate performance.  what a waste!",1303603200,4,1070,4.624338624338624
659527,2,6303422136,"I should probably start by confessing that I'm not an expert on Dorothy Parker, or the Algonquin Round Table. But I have at least read Harpo Marx's autobiography, which paints a fairly vivid portrait of the Round Table and particularly of Alexander Woollcott.

Reading Harpo's book, I got the idea that seeing a movie about the Round Table might be interesting and fun; but, alas, ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" is not the engaging movie I had envisioned. It is, indeed, a depressing drag of a film, which seems more inclined to sneer at the frivolity of the Round Table than to celebrate its wit. Judging from this movie, you'd be forgiven for thinking that everyone who participated in the Round Table was an empty-headed fluff, and for thinking that Dorothy Parker's entire life was nothing but a soul-killing series of random hook-ups with boring guys.

Like far too many biopics, ""Mrs. Parker"" resorts to grim melodramatics in an attempt to ""humanize"" its subject. Despite this tedious approach, the film never really succeeds in making Dorothy Parker come alive as a person. She is, in this movie, nothing more than the sum of the cocktails she drinks and the people she sleeps with. The other characters are similarly underdeveloped. In reality, Harpo Marx and Woollcott had a very close friendship; but in this movie, Harpo exists only to run around and biff people, and Woollcott exists only to make the occasional snide remark. There is no nuance here, no real suggestion of friendship between these people, and no real exploration of their art.

Which is a shame, because this movie certainly looks great (in terms of period detail), and it has a stellar cast. But too many fine actors - Wallace Shawn and Gwyneth Paltrow among them - are wasted on boring, do-nothing parts. Jennifer Jason Leigh is left to carry the movie basically by herself, and she does only an OK job; she has the languid and depressed demeanor right, but occasionally her accent is downright incomprehensible.

As for the DVD itself ... well, the print is fine, and there are the standard features (commentary, short documentary on Parker, etc). Honestly, I couldn't bring myself to explore the features much; by the time I was done watching the movie, I felt like I needed a long rest.",1298851200,3,2276,4.843187660668381
659528,3,6303422136,"I found this film so disappointing.  It has a great cast, and as a Dorothy Parker fan, I was hoping for a biopic that would do her justice.  This film had just about everything - in addition to that cast, there were good costumes, great sets and locations and good camera work.  But the soundtrack was godawful, at least on the DVD - the nearly constant incidental music was simply so loud so often it drowned out a lot of the dialogue.  Then, too, there was another serious problem - Jennifer Jason Leigh's failed attempt to imitate the upperclass accent Dorothy Parker used.  Leigh is no Meryl Streep and she went too far.  Too far north, in fact.  Parker was from New Jersey, not Massachusetts.  If you watch the documentary feature that comes with the DVD, you'll hear sound recordings of Parker reading her poetry aloud.  You can understand Parker easily, despite her Briticized r's.  Leigh, on the other hand, does some strange things with vowels - her long o's, for example, tend to run in the direction of rhyming with ""cow.""  Worse, she speaks throughout the film with her teeth clenched and nearly every sentence starts out with sufficient volume to be audible, but about half or 2/3 of the way through the sentence, the volume drops to the level of mumbling.  Again and again, I couldn't understand what she was saying.  To a lesser degree, Campbell Scott as Robert Benchley did some of the same thing, but not nearly as often and, at least, he didn't mumble so much.  Unfortunately, the DVD has neither closed captions capability nor any subtitles for the DVD player, not even English subtitles for the hearing impaired.  Seldom have I encountered a film that needed one of those features or the other to the degree this film does.

I did catch a whole bunch of Parker's famous wisecracks in the dialogue because, fortunately, I knew them already. (You can make out mumbling much more easily when you already know the lines.)  When Leigh posed as Parker reciting her own poetry, it was a crying shame.  In reading Parker's famous poem about suicide, ""R&eacute;sum&eacute;,"" you could make out most of the lines but the last one -- which is the punchline of the cynically humorous eight-line poem.  Her readings of the poems were perfunctory at best, conveying little feeling for the poems, if any.
In the end, Leigh's lack of skill in imitating an accent and in enunciating and projecting gave Mrs. Parker short shrift indeed.

It's a shame, really.  I blame the director for a lot of it.  If he couldn't get Jennifer Jason Leigh to imitate Parker's speech any better than he did, he should have found a different actress, not to mention a competent sound recordist and sound mixer.",1297209600,5,2694,4.711538461538462

I've also read the works of all the writers portrayed, plus James Thurber's wonderful ""The Years with Ross"" about the early years of the New Yorker magazine and it's founder and editor, Harold Ross.  There's much that is tragic about Parker's life, and some of those around her, but the tragedy here is that Parker's brilliant words are so swallowed and garbled by Leigh that after about five minutes, I went back to the main menu, hoping to find my way to a selection of subtitles that would include English, so I could actually understand Leigh - no such luck.  Those of you who can understand anything said by Bob Dylan may have better luck.  It's a shame because everything else about this film is

Although this biographical film seems quite accurate and not glossed over, the film has many problems, i.e., direction and editing.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is sometimes hard to understand what she is saying. Of course, I understand that it must be very difficult to deliver clear, understandable lines while also trying to convey that you are falling-down drunk, as she is during about one-third of the film. I've watched the film several times, and I still haven't been able to understand all her magnificent witty lines. The most famous of which are included in the film. The film tried to encompass the entirety of her life in two-hours.  It would have been better just to make a film on a section of her life:  i.e. ""Mrs. Parker Does Hollywood,"" ""Mrs. Parker Does the Roaring Twenties,"" or perhaps ""Mrs. Parker Does Charles MacArthur.""  However, I liked the film enough that I'll probably even watch it again, but next time with a glass of scotch in my hand so that I'll feel a part of the times and be able to identify with her better.  Maybe if I'm drunk, too, I will understand what she is saying when she's drunk.  I was disappointed that the film didn't include Lillian Hellman, who was a friend of hers, and who tried to help Parker in her last years. There's a scene near the end of the film where Dorothy Parker is in a bar and an obscure actor (played by Stanley Tucci) comes over to talk to her.  They could have substituted a scene with Lillian Hellman, who also liked bars, for that scene, and it would have been more interesting and literary. See: [...]",1233360000,5,1646,4.555932203389831

If you want to see a Dorothy Parker that makes you want to kill either yourself or her first; if you want to see a Harpo Marx (my absolute comic hero) that should be prescribed Ritalin and a club over the head; or the charming Matthew Broderick fail to revive an expiring movie, then spend your hard earned cash on this. Better still, get Jennifer Jason Leigh whatever is the opposite of Ritalin and charisma lessons.

I have been to the Algonquin and imbibed its delights, watched the movie/plays of George Kaufman for years, been an avid fan of biting, satirical wit and wordplay most of my life and I say, for a bio-based fun flick of the early 1900s, choose The Man Who Came to Dinner (or even Bambi) over this one.",1181088000,9,1042,4.566844919786096

The woman was a genius and with her acid wit, eternally quote-worthy quips, and keen eye that saw all-too clearly into the foibles and idiosyncrasies of her age, ""Mrs. Parker"" deserved better than the treatment she is given in this film. I will give Jennifer Jason Leigh credit for her performance here, and once or twice I thought this movie was almost going to take off, but it never did. Maybe someday someone will do right by Dorothy Parker and make a film that truly celebrates her as she deserves.",1171584000,,674,4.625
659601,5,6303422136,"Critics moaned when Jennifer Jason Leigh was tapped to portray Dorothy Parker, the Grand Lady of Barbed Words whose light shone brightest in the colorful 1920s. And, predictably, many critics trashed Leigh's performance. But, while Leigh made her name making sexy comedies and sexy thrillers, she actually does an excellent job here as the witty wordsmith in ""Mrs. Parker & the Vicious Circle."" OK, so she played a sexy wordsmith, getting naked with fellow writer Charles MacArthur (Matthew Broderick) for an eye-candy romp. But the sex and nudity, for all its visual appeal, could have hit the cutting-room floor without much being lost from the film. The romance that makes this film worth watching is the romance that never happens: Parker's non-romance with humorist Robert Benchley (Campbell Scott).

Let's face it, Broderick shared top billing with Leigh because he's a name. But it's Scott who deserved it; it's Scott's Benchley who provided an excellent foil for matching wits and barbs with Parker. They were, it seems, the perfect match -- but the film tells us they never consummated for fear of losing what closeness they already had.

Parker, Benchley and, to some extent, MacArthur were part of the Algonquin Round Table, the so-called ""vicious circle"" of the title, a regular gathering of the luminaries of the writing field back in the good ol' days of Prohibition. And director Alan Rudolph assembled a fine cast to round out the circle: Robert Sherwood (Nick Cassavetes), Edna Ferber (Lili Taylor), F. Scott Fitzgerald (Malcolm Gets), Harold Ross (Sam Robards) and Alexander Woollcott (Tom McGowan), among others, plus occasional cameos by the likes of Will Rogers (Keith Carradine) and a lively Harpo Marx (J.M. Henry).

We get to see them talk and drink at New York's Algonquin Hotel, we get to see them drink and talk at private parties. We also get to see them put on a variety show, the highlight of which is Benchley's fumbling financial report. Occasionally, we see a few of them working, as writers and editors of Vanity Fair and the fledgling New Yorker.

The film plays havoc with chronology, jumping around in the '20s, '30s, '40s and '50s, interspersed with brief scenes of Leigh reciting a few lines of Parker's immortal poetry. But most of the film is set in the '20s, and that's where the real color lies. (To drive that point home, Rudolph had later scenes filmed in black and white, while the early stuff in the '20s is in vivid color.) The Round Table comprised some of the finest literary minds of the age, and the lines popping out of their mouths throughout the film are classic literary gems. The best are traded between Parker and Benchley, who flirt outrageously across the years but never ""misbehave"" -- with each other, anyway -- like so many of their peers were doing.

Some of the best scenes are shot at the Table, with the camera panning from face to face as they drop lines -- many of which today crowd the pages of any good book of quotations -- with machine-gun rapidity and a surgeon's precision.

Of course, Parker's life wasn't all grins and giggles, and Leigh manages to show us the pain beneath the giddy facade. Parker, like many of her friends, was an alcoholic. She was unlucky in love and kept outliving her beloved dogs. She attempted suicide a few times; the movie shows only once. She was proud, but often too poor to sustain her lifestyle. She survived most of her friends, sank into senility and, despite her wishes, died on a sunny day. She also excelled in a field and an era dominated by men, and her name and writings outlasted the work of many of her male contemporaries.

This isn't a feel-good film by any stretch, but it's not dark and depressing, either. It's a slice of life -- in this case, a slice of several extraordinary lives from a very different time. The dialogue borrows heavily from the characters' actual words, and it's some of the most sparkling dialogue to show up on the big screen in a very long time.

659672,4,6303422136,"Dorothy Parker was a woman tragically ahead of her time. She wrote with real honesty and wit about what it felt like to be a woman in a man's world, and her acerbic tongue became legendary. Dorothy Parker was also a lonely woman who was profoundly unhappy all her life, failed twice at marriage and suicide, and loved her friend and colleague Robert Benchley all her life, never acting on her desire for him.

""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" does a wonderful job of depicting Dorothy Parker's life on film. It shows Parker young and vibrant in the 1920's, which are filmed in color, and then slowly fading into alcoholism in the 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. The latter sequences are shot in black and white, which is a fascinating way to structure the film. As the color drains from Dorothy's life, it drains from the screen as well. Director Alan Rudolph, who also wrote the screenplay, does a wonderful job of evoking the period of New York and Hollywood in the 20's and 30's.

Jennifer Jason Leigh is an extremely versatile actress, and she excels as Dorothy Parker. She looks, sounds, and acts so much like the real Mrs. Parker, especially in the scenes when she recites some of Parker's most autobiographical poetry. Leigh plays Dorothy as a woman who simply understood life too well, and was never able to be happy. When younger, she tried to be, but as the years roll on, you can see Dorothy slowly giving up, finally allowing herself to be forgotten. In a pivotal scene towards the end of the film, a psychiatrist tells Dorothy that she needs to face her pain more directly. Tears rollong down her face, she replies ""Face it more directly? I face it every day. I fall in love with married men, but I do it purpose. I drink too much, but that's because I'm thirsty. I think my version of pain is more fun than yours."" Leigh gives a brave, intense performance as Dorothy Parker, and she deserved more recognition for her work than she got.

Campbell Scott is also excellent as Robert Benchley, the fellow writer that Dorothy loved. Benchley was a married man, and the two never became intimate, although they loved each other deeply. ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" is not always an easy film to watch because it depicts a brilliant and vulnerable woman slowly drowning in her own unhappiness, with no hope that things will ever get better. In life, Parker regarded herself a failure as a writer, and died alone and forgotten at the age of 74. Her one wish was to die on a cloudy, rainy day. True to her luck, on the day of her death the sun was shining.",1093046400,8,2568,4.542116630669547
659673,5,6303422136,"The biting and caustic wit of Mrs Parker is bought superbly to life by the versatile actress Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays the brittle writer, critic and sometimes playwright to vulnerable perfection.
This is not an easy film to watch and I can understand why some people found it hard to get into.  I mean the 1920s were supposedly a time of fun, jazz, speak easy booze and laughter all around, the Great War was over and life was back to normal.
However watching the desperation of Mrs Parker's generation, the bright young things drink themselves silly, take drugs and lash out at each other in a perpetual game of verbal cat-o-nine-tails makes you realise that perhaps everything was not as ""normal"" as most people hoped.
The film jumps back and forth through Mrs Parker's life, some of the best scenes are in black and white, and we are treated to subtle barbs, cruel wit and tasty treats in the guise of a crackingly good cast, with Mathew Broderick doing himself proud as the sweet talking but brutal rouge who abandons his pregnant lover (Mrs Parker), Andrew McCarthy as Mrs Parker's husband Eddie, fresh from war and addicted to morphine.
All in all this is a deliciously complex film that will you need to see more than once, well worth an evening in with a box of pop-corn and a friend to share the sarcasm, and the very satirical humour that runs through the film from beginning to end.",1089417600,47,1399,4.618473895582329

I suppose closed-captioning would help, but for that I will need a newer television set.  Did she have to be quite that slurry?  The Benchley is well portrayed, but a bit too ideally.  One is not prepared, from Campbell Scott's wholesome portrayal, for his cerebral hemorrhage from alcoholism as I was just turning one month old not far away.  The sad fact is, Benchely was a teetotaler and pressed into drinking by his social set and film role stereotype.  Anyone who has seen the real Benchley of the late thirties and early forties can see what it did to him.

659760,4,6303422136,"During the mid-eighties, Alan Rudolph was one of the enfants-terrible of filmmaking, along with John Hughes, Barry Levinson, Lucas and Robert Zemeckis. Then, for some reason, we lost him. After finishing off a trilogy that had featured Keith Carradine and Genevieve Bujold, Rudolph proceeded to make ill-advised movies like ""Made In Heaven"", losing MY interest almost immediately. You'll remember, if you saw it, that this film featured Timothy Hutton and his then-wife, Debra Winger. Winger played God, if you can believe that!

Anyway, with ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"", Herr Rudolph is back in form, going back to his ""The Moderns"" era, the 20s, but this time, taking a bead on the PSEUDO-bohemian life in flapper era New York, rather than Paris, specifically the goings-on amongst the habitu&eacute;s of the Algonquin Round Table and various Cond&eacute; Nast and New Yorker Magazine writers and editors.

Jennifer Jason Leigh is good as the acerbic Ms. Parker, but I can't help thinking that the somewhat well-known standup comic, Margaret Smith, would not have been a better choice. She has the mien, NATURAL speech pattern and delivery you would expect Dorothy Parker to have had, and her act consists of just the type of bromides and anecdotes you'd expect to come out of that droll lady's mouth. Leigh is just too cute and cuddly to portray such an acid-tongued, distaff reprobate! Susan Sarandon, who looks EXACTLY like Parker with those big doe eyes and drawn mouth, would have been another excellent choice!

However, some of the other actors portraying Algonquin luminaries were picked MUCH more carefully, specifically the two doing Alexander Wolcott and George S. Kauffmann. It is, however, almost disturbing that Campbell Scott, parlaying the famous Robert Benchley, bares not a WHIT of resemblance to HIS target, either in manner or appearance! I say John Lovitz, with a standard issue, 30s-style pencil-thin moustache and pocket square, would have been the choice here, since there are hardly any Robert Benchley clones left anymore....

However, true to Rudolph form, the era is reproduced flawlessly, from the costuming to the set design and art direction. The writing is witty, esp. for the background male members of the Round Table. However, as good as Leigh is, you get the feeling that she is either trying too hard in the role of Parker, or is just about to nod off, her reading is so lethargic.

Don't get me wrong, I LIKE Jennifer Jason Leigh, I just think that the inimitable Mss. Smith or Sarandon would have been much better choices.

Nonetheless, this is Rudolph again at his best....putting the microscope to an artistic microcosm and recreating the setting faithfully. Unlike any other director...Alan Rudolph is the undeniable KING of 20th century period mood!

659761,5,6303422136,"I was altogether unfamiliar with Dorothy Parker, and the Algonquin Round before this film. The only writer of their generation that I had read was F. Scott Fitzgerald, as required reading in school.  I have never read ""The New Yorker,"" which also plays a part in the story.
This film does a good job educating the ignorant, such as myself, while spinning an interesting story about an interesting woman.  The layout of the film, the cuts through time interspersed with Parker's witticisms made for nice viewing and opened up the era for me.  Highlights and disappointments, romance and heartbreaks, the movie plays like the way I think a Jazz Age novel should.
Jennifer Jason Leigh is great in the title role.  The accent is a little odd, mainly because I had just see ""Hudsucker Proxy"" where she uses an almost identical accent.
""Mrs. Parker and her Vicious Circle"" sparked my interest in writer's of this generation, and that is what a biographical film should do.  A greater background knowledge of the personalities represented adds to the enjoyment of the film.",1039910400,18,1066,4.9
659762,5,6303422136,"I should probably begin by saying that I'm not old enough nor well-read enough to recognize the times and places and characters in this film.  I know it's based in truth... but to me, it's simply a character study.
And such a wonderful character study!  It's one of my favorite films.  (In some strange way it reminds me of ""The Sandpiper,"" though it doesn't take similar detours into absurdity and melodrama.)  I think that Jennifer Jason Leigh is perhaps the greatest actress of her generation.  Here, more than in any other of her works that I've seen, she has the opportunity to create a character that's not driven by plot, or subservient to an ""ensemble"" (not that there's anything wrong with that... ""Short Cuts"" is another of my favorite films, and she contributed admirably), but just takes center stage and wins us with her very being.  Dorothy/Jennifer is sad, but so compelling.
Many years ago, a woman I loved named Carol, when asked whether she was into ""Women's Lib"" replied, ""I don't care about 'Women's Lib.'  I've been into 'Carol's Lib' for thirty years now.""  Dorothy Parker was that kind of woman.  She had little time for what either men or women expected of her: the challenge was to be what she expected of herself.  In the end, I think, she failed to satisfy her hopes and dreams; but she carved a bright path in the sky as her star rose and fell.  If the end of life leaves something still aware, I hope she can look upon her legend with the same wry humor she turned upon her fellows.  She deserves that.
What I'm saying, I guess, is that if you love Jennifer Jason Leigh, you'll surely love this movie.  If you love seeing a character (be it real or fictional) fleshed out so that you can almost taste the salt in her tears and feel the desperation behind the bravado in her eyes... you'll surely love this movie.
If you wanted something ""exciting"" to happen, you should probably look elsewhere.
(And, for what it's worth... I'm wondering if there are different soundtracks to this movie.  I have it on laser disc.  My hearing, frankly, is none too good; and I never had any trouble understanding the dialog.  All I hear is Jennifer creating a character, and doing it very well.  I find her ""accent"" only to add to the sense of character.  Whether it's true to the real-life Dorothy Parker, I have no idea.)",1035331200,8,2335,4.572115384615385
659763,5,6303422136,"I won't argue with the reviewer who maintained that this film portrayed the players of the Algonquin circle in a stagy and unrealistic manner. It gives me smug satisfaction knowing the obvious hole in this criticism is that these ingredients can make a film great if done right. And done right it was in Mrs. Parker and The Vicious Circle. Each time I see this film, I experience the joy of watching the lives of luminous people through a peephole, a delicious voyeuristic journey into the unknowable literary past.
The thing about Jennifer Jason Leigh and her interpretation of Dorothy Parker's manner of speech? Did you ever sit through hours of Julia Child's famous cooking show and take note of the distinctive speech of this remarkable lady, also from New England? If Jennifer Jason Leigh were ever to star in a biography of Julia Child, she would either have to learn the idiosyncracies of Ms. Child's speech or not play the part.
Jennifer Jason Leigh is brilliant and almost became Dorothy Parker in the black and white scene where she recites a poem about all the things she shouldn't do and how she doesn't, after all, give a damn. That short scene was acting at the highest possible level achievement. Ms. Leigh recited the poem in characteristic Dorothy Parker style and conveyed the essence of the poem and the poet exclusively with her eyes.
I am proud that this pinnacle of dramatic performance was given by an American actor. So often, with all of the puerile bilge that pumps out of the filmmaking industry in this country, we forget that we have stunning talent to show the world.",1006905600,5,1597,4.748201438848921
659764,4,6303422136,"By most standards (if such standards actually exist in this trivial pop culture we've created), this is no better than a 2- or 3-star movie.  It's unfocused, meandering, slow-moving, and at times it unnecessarily keeps secrets from its audience.  Having said that, for me this movie is also addictive.  I've sat through it many, many times.

Part of the reason is the subject matter - for New-Yorkophiles, the Algonquin Round Table is a core curriculum, and anyone who can put two cohesive sentences together can appreciate the life and work of Dorothy Parker.  There are films in which these people are talked about or in the background, but this is the first film I know of that attempts to showcase them.  And bravo to anyone who tries it.

The other reason I can't stop watching is Jennifer Jason Leigh.  She was a wise casting choice.  I won't rehash the superlatives others have heaped on her.  I will hereby disagree with those who downplay her performance in this film.  She's the reason it's compellingly watchable.

Watching the life of Dorothy Parker unfold before your eyes should feel like watching a train wreck.  Granted, this film skips over a lot of her non-Roundtable years, but the way the film jumps back and forth in time is as lavishly excessive as Parker was herself.

As a filmmaker, Alan Rudolph usually needs to be forgiven for some aspect of his product.  He won't go down in history as one of the great filmmakers.
