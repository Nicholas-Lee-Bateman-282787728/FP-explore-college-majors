1004777,5,6305285861,"Brief Story summary below followed by brief review. *Caution: Spoilers*

Brief Summary: The film begins with a young military veteran named Danilla Bagrov wandering through the country who accidently ruins a music video shoot and gets in a fight with the hired security. After severely injuring them, Danilla is arrested but eventually let go by a sympathetic police chief who knew his father. The chief demands Danilla gets a job or faces probation so Danilla leaves his town at behest of his mother to see his brother Victor in St. Petersburg, formally Leningrad.

Upon Danilla's arrival, he cannot find his brother and instead hangs around with a homeless street vendor named Hoffman, who goes by ""German,"" after saving him from an extorting thug. Afterward, he meets a local party girl named Kat, who unsuccessfully offers him sex and drugs for money. Danilla leaves Kat in search of his brother, eventually finding his apartment where he is  greeted  by a loaded gun pointed at his head.

Unbeknownst to their mother, Victor is a mob hit man who was recently charged with assassinating a Chechen mob boss who controls a local market.  Victor then outsources this job to his brother, Danilla, after angering Kruglyj, the mob boss who assigned him the hit, by asking for more money.

Danilla prepares for the hit and successfully kills the Chechen market boss, but is then chased and wounded by two of Kruglyj's thugs who were to kill Victor after the hit. Danilla is able to hop into a tram car driven by a woman named Sveta, who agrees to help him. Danilla goes to German for help with his wounds and is mended over a few days while in hiding. At this time, Kruglyi threatens Sveta who lies and protects Danilla.  After Danilla has his health back, he thanks Sveta and begins an intimate relationship with her, even though she is a married to an abusive husband. They go to a Natualis concert, a band mentioned often in the film, where Daniel sees Kat and gets her number.  A few days later, Danilla threatens Sveta's husband to leave her alone, saying that if he doesn't he will kill him. That night, he goes to a club with Kat and eventually goes out to deal with other mob business set up for him by Victor the next day.

While Danilla is out, Kruglyin and his men find Sveta and beat/rape her for lying to them. This motivated Danilla to then find and kill Kruglyi and his men, who at this point, are at Victor's apartment and have beaten and tied him up.  Kruglyi then makes Victor lure Danilla in so they may kill him.  Expecting this, Danilla prepares a shotgun and other weapons and surprises and kills Kruglyi and his men in Victor's apartment.  He decides to let one man live so he may tell the others what happened there. The henchman who was allowed to live explains that it was Victor who betrayed him and Danilla informs him that he knew. Danilla then explains to a fearful Victor that he loves and forgives him and that he has become weak in the city. Danilla then tells Victor that he will return home to mother and become a policeman.

Danilla, now rich with mob money taken from Kruglyi, goes to retrieve Sveta and start a life together.  He finds her husband there beating her and shoots him in the leg with a shotgun. Sveta then runs to his aid and tells Danilla to leave.  This surprises Danilla and he is visibly shaken as he had hoped she would leave with him. Danilla then takes the money and begins hitchhiking to Moscow, where he eventually gets picked up by a truck driver.

Brief Review: Brother (1997) directed by Aleksei Balabanov and starring Sergei Bodrov, Jr. as the lead character, Danilla, was in my opinion an overall great film. The scene that was set along with the various connection with characters, including Kat and German that has been left out of my review, made for an interesting glimpse into a time shortly after the Soviet collapse. To have such a complex charter with a moral code, battling the mob must have spoken to the average Russian citizen.  Those born into rotting infrastructure of the USSR now had an iconic everyman as the hero fighting the disease of corruption. It also took time to touch on, what I believe to be, hot topics even today like: Poverty with German, Violence and Abuse with Sveta and her husband, and drug culture and Russian youth with Kat. I can imagine why this was such a big hit as it seems like it would stir the Russian soul to see someone, albeit fictional, make a difference in a dark situation. I advise everyone to check it out.",1398902400,,4520,4.593788819875776
1004778,3,6305285861,"Aleksei Balbanovs Brat is a crime/mob drama that was a Russian box hit that was released in 1997.  This movie stars Sergei Bodrov, as Danila Bagrov; Viktor Sukhorukov, as Victor Bagrov; Svetlana Pimichenko, Sveta; and Yuriy Kuznetsov, as Nemets.  This movie depicts the story of a recently released veteran, Danila Bagrov. After being persuaded to seek out his brother, Danila travels to his city, where his life takes a drastic turn. Danilas brother is a hitman name Victor, who lives in St. Petersburg. Before finding Victor, Danila meets a man called Nemets, who he quickly befriends. After being hired for a suspicious job, Danila finds himself betrayed, in a love affair, and being hunted by a an angry Russian mob.
Throughout the film, we see a reoccurrence of the word brother. Victor and Danila constantly refer to each other as this. The distinction lies in how Danila uses the word brother and how Victor uses the word brother. Danila loves and respects Victor, as he has looked up to the him since their father died. Therefore, Danila uses the word brother with a sense of love and respect. Victor on the other hand, betrays his brother, sets him up, and is willing to sacrifice Danila to save himself, yet refers to Danila as brother too. In fact, the only time that Victor refers to Danila as brother is a positive way is at the end of the film, when Danila save Victors after everything that has occurred. This depicts a few of the themes of the film; the power of family and the power of the environment. Danilas character portrays the idea of family over everything because he saves his brothers live after all that has ensued. Victor portrays the idea of falling victim to an exhausting city, since he threw his brother away to for money and to save himself. This film ultimately wrestles with the concept of nature vs. nurture. Nature,being Danilas naturally tendency to forgive and rescue a malicious silbing, and nature, being Victors predicament of falling victim to the succubus of a city.
The film, Brat, was slow paced (as many Russian movies), and at times difficult to understand. Although this movie was a block buster for Russia in 1997, I think it was a bit overrated. It was interesting to watch, but Danilas charactered was not evolved enough. He goes from being a soldier to a hitman, and I think his transformation should have been elaborated. Why did he decide to take a criminal life? Why is he a drifter? Is he violent solely because of the loss of his father? I think the film should have explored this more thoroughly to make the movie easier to follow. The best part of the movie is its ability to be realistic. Love and betrayal is a common idea, especially with the notion that we hurt the ones we love. Siblings take advantage of each other all the time and that is essentially what occurred in Brat. Overall, Brat was an interesting Russian film that truly explores the ideas behind family and the environment.",1394755200,,2953,4.709864603481625
1004779,5,6305285861,"This movie was directed by Aleksei Balabanova and overall was very good. It is about two brothers of whom the first was Danila Vagrov was discharged from the army and previously worked as a clerk at an army depot. He was discharged because of a reduction in the Russian military active troops. He later walks onto the set after being discharged of a band called Nautilus. Later he goes to his mothers of whom tells him he should get a real job like his brother who works as his mother thinks as a successful businessman. Much to her surprise his brother Victor works as a very successful Hit-man in Saint Petersburg. The plot continues from there with these two brothers teaming up to hunt various targets of the Chechen Mafia across Saint Petersburg meeting very interesting and fun plot twists along the way. The budget for this movie was around 10,000 USD but, the director Aleksei Balabanova and the two main characters Sergei Bodrov Platovesch as Danila Bagrov and Viktor Sukhorukov as Victor do an excellent job in this Russian crime film. The soundtrack is amazing by the Russian band Nautilus and the cinematography is very good as well. I personally have seen this movie about 4 times and I've watched Brat 2 about 2-3 times. I would highly recommend it to a person of whom is interested in watching a good foreign film.

1004819,4,6305285861,"<strong>Brat</strong> (Aleksey Balabanov, 1997)

Aleksey Balabanov didn't really become known in America until 2007, when <em>Gruz 200</em> either kicked off or extended, depending on whether you consider Andrey Iskanov's <em>Nails</em> part of it, a new wave of Russian absurdist filmmaking that has produced some true gems over the past few years. But in the rest of the world, Balabanov has been an underground sensation for years. His third feature, <em>Brat</em> (released in English-speaking countries as <em>Brother</em>), took home a raft of awards in 1997-98 and marked him as a director to watch in countries from Canada to Italy. Even the Chicago film critics took notice, handing the late Sergey Bodrov Jr. a Best Actor award and nominating it for Best Film (it lost to Alan Rickman's <em>The Winter Guest</em>), but Chicago, alas, does not seem to have the draw of New york or LA when it comes to putting names in front of people, and so we in America forgot about Aleksey Balabanov for a decade. More fool us.

<em>Brother</em> tells the story of Danila Bagrov (<em>War</em>'s Sergey Bodrov Jr., tragically killed in an avalanche while scouting scenes for a film at the age of thirty), an Army clerk who's trying to transition to civvie life. After a quick, unsuccessful try living with his mother, he ends up traveling to St. Petersburg to visit his brother (<em>The Island</em>'s Viktor Sukhorukov), known in the film only as The Tatar. Mom says he's doing well for himself up there, and Danila soon finds out that's the case--The Tatar is a freelance hitman, currently being targeted by his own boss, known as Roundhead, for being too greedy. The Tatar subcontracts the assassination of The Chechen, a former terrorist now horning in on Roundhead's protection racket, to Danila, who takes the job, needing some quick cash. This gets him in deep with Roundhead, who's found himself not only someone else to kill, but a potentially valuable subcontractor as well. Meanwhile, Danila has also made himself something of a name for dispensing vigilante justice, earning the friendships of various homeless folks, drug dealers, and the like, all of whom form a loose, unofficial network helping him out. And just to make things a little more complicated, he also finds himself sliding into a possible love triangle with tram driver Sveta (Balabanov regular Svetlana Pismichenko), who helped him escape the scene after the Chechen job, and Kat (Mariya Zhukova in her only screen appearance), a local party girl who offers a means of temporary escape from the stresses of Danila's quotidian existence.

It's complex, it's cerebral, and it's a good deal of fun. Balabanov got better as a filmmaker as time went on (here, he's way too fond of the overly-dramatic fadeout), but you can see how good he is at getting the best out of his cast and how good he is at pacing what could have easily been an all-too-boring film. <em>Brother</em> is anything but, and an excellent document of the early career of a director who just keeps getting better and better. *** ",1332979200,,3067,5.007843137254902

1004821,5,6305285861,"This is billed as a Russian `Pulp Fiction', I beg to differ and actually like both films, but this sort of stays with you and is more real. It stars Sergei Bodrov as Daniel, who has just been discharged from the Russian army. After he gets into a slight fracas with some film security guards, his rather earthy looking mother tells him to go and be with her `little Viktor' in Leningrad. He is the one thing the family has to be proud of, as her no good husband managed to go and die in prison - typical.

Well off he goes buying new music along the way to play in his Disc Man. On arrival he runs into a poor German trying to sell some pitiful wares in a rather down market flea market. He introduces himself as Hoffman, but Dani calls him `German' throughout. He has some more encounters where he seems to be a sort of Robin Hood attitude, doing good for good people. When he finally tracks the saintly Victor down it sort of become obvious rather quick that his halo has somewhat slipped and he is now a hit man for the mafia, well can't win em all can you? But Dani has always looked up to his brother, so when he suggests entering the 'family business', Dani agrees without much conscience wrangling. He claims to have been a clerk in the army, missing out on all the actual fighting. If that is the case then the Russian army training videos must be rather good, as he just takes to his new `job' like a duck to water.

The music is very urban and keeps surprising you throughout and there is a love interest too, whic moves the plot along nicely.

I do not want to give the plot away as this 1 hour 35 minute film really speeds by, there are only good performances, the violence is often, but not gratuitous and thoroughly believable, not over the top gore or cool shoot outs, but messy and very human. Great points I like from this film, they say `Hello' when they answer the phone (like the French ) they played faded glam rockers `Slade' at a `cool' party and do all live on vodka, something we thought was propaganda.

He seeks his elder brother only to find him enmeshed in a life of crime and murder.  Our hero turns on a tough guy performance 'par excellence'.  Balabanov's direction is taut and memorable.

However, beneath the bloody surface, Alexei Balabanov explores some of the consequences of compulsory military service for the young men of Russia; those who cannot use privilege to avoid it. The paradox of Sergei Podrov's character, Danila Bagrov, is that while he insists that he stayed in Army Headquarters for the duration, his many regular and unconventional military talents are revealed. He is somewhat of a latter-day Russian version of ""McGyver"". This in contrast his brother Sergei, played by Victor Sukhorukov (Poor Poor Pavel). Sergei is a coward, who throws his brother to the wolves, as gangs battle for control of a market in Moscow. Sergei never expects Danila to survive. In the end, when it is obvious that Danila has vastly more courage, resourcefulness and strength of character, Sergei begs for his life. It is unnecessary. Danila continues to forgive his brother and shows compassion for those in need, while being ruthless with others of evil intent.

Music is fascinating to the point that we learn that Russia in 1990s have its own, unique voice, no matter how terrifying it may be.  A film like this one becomes part of the personal library collection.",1198627200,,1122,4.3

""WARNING POSSIBLE SPOLIERS""

It starts out with Danila he wonders onto a movie set, he gets into trouble for it.  As it turns out, he recently returned from the war. And his mother seems to admire his big brother more then him.  Well anyways he goes to St. Petersburg to live with his brother.  There he meets all sorts of people.  He makes friends with a homeless German, with a female drugee, and he makes love to a married woman, who not only becomes his misterss, but whose husband also abuses her.  He also likes music a lot too.  See there's some redeming qualities right there!

Well anways back to his brother, his brother isn't so innocent.  His brother hires him to kill a Chechnian warlord for him.  Well sooner or later, he kills mercifulessly the people sent by the Chechnian warlord.  And at the end well I won't tell you the end, just watch it and see.

See both volumes of this movie (Brat 1 and Brat 2/Brother 1 and 2), very contemporarty, down to eath and close to the reality of Russian mafia.

Also, see some Soviet movies of 1960s-70s-80s. Some are true masterpieces and are admired by many generations. You won't find anything like them.",1170633600,,444,4.92
1004913,3,6305285861,"The film directed by Aleksei Balabanov takes the viewer into the world of Russian organized crime.  Danila is introduced to the criminal world by way of his brother Viktor after he returns home from his military service.  The crimial life isn't really much different since all he knew from his military experience was violence anyways.  He goes through this life of crime, killing a lot of people and what not.  They throw in a love twist to the movie, because you need to have some romance with all the action, right?  Turns out Danila is a pretty clever criminal, and he lives, and at the end he heads to Moscow.

The movie was okay, but I don't really feel the sympathy for Danila like maybe the movie intended.  Its too bad he didn't have a better role-model in his brother than what he had.  But I guess you could look at it that Danila turned out to be a successful ""business man"" so his upbringing couldn't have been too bad.",1165622400,,932,4.4411764705882355
1004914,4,6305285861,"The movie is about a local mafia chief's hiring Viktor to kill a rival while planning to kill him rather than pay his price for the contract. But Viktor subcontracts the job to his little brother, who has told him that he spent his military service as a clerical employee at HQ. When the goons make as if to kill him, he shows that he has hidden depths. Viktor is impressed with Danila's actions and sees that Danila is fully capable and suggests that they go into business together as the Bogrov Brothers. But now the mafia chief is now going after both of them. Danila is on the run, his brother in hiding, and as the bad guys get close there a lot of adventures that the brothers must get through so that they can survive.

The movie was very good and entertaining. I give the film a B+ because it was full of action but still had some comical spots.",1164585600,,853,4.265432098765432
1004915,3,6305285861,"This film is a look at Russian organized crime.  In the movie Danila, a young man who has recently left the army, is sent by his mother to live with his brother in St. Petersburg.  When he arrives his brother reveals that he has been hired to kill a Chechen crime boss and would like Danila to do it for him.  Danila uses his army know-how to easily dispose of the man and as he is running away he meets a trolley conductor named Svetlana.  The two begin an affair that lasts until near the end of the movie when another group of criminals come looking for Danila to kill him because he killed the Chechen.  They beat up Svetlana but when Danila comes back he thinks she was beaten by her husband and proceeds to give the man his ""comeuppance"".  When Svetlana sees this she realizes that she doesn't love Danila and tells him to leave.  He then receives a call from his brother asking him to meet him at his home.  Knowing this is a trap Danila prepares beforehand and kills all the men waiting for him except for one who he promised to let live.  He then takes all the money his brother was paid for the Chechen job, tells him to return home and take care of their mother, and leaves town for Moscow.",1160524800,,1201,4.232456140350878
1004916,3,6305285861,This movie definately caught me by surprise.  It was quite different in terms of the plot and entertainment level.  I was expecting to be put to sleep during the viewing but was plesently surprised to find that the movie kept me entertained throughout a vast majority of it.  The acting was above average for a foreign film and had a decent storyline.  It seemed to have a very real outlook on what life was like in Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and more than opened my eyes on the hard times that fell on Russia.,1160524800,,532,4.3979591836734695
1004917,4,6305285861,"I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie, but I found it to be an interesting snapshot of post-Soviet Russian life. It showed how easy it is to slip into criminal life when the opportunity presents itself.

The movie was also an interesting discussion on morality. Danila was not a bad guy, though he did fit into the criminal world well. He still did what he could for those who had nothing. It was, at times, hard to reconcile the cold-blooded killer and the compassionate young man.

The movie showed and interesting dynamic between the two Danilas. There was also the family dynamic; his brother was willing to put Danila's life in danger. Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Overall, the movie was entertaining. It was heavy, but with a few lighter spots so the viewer doesn't get overwhelmed.",1160438400,,814,4.75886524822695
1004918,3,6305285861,"The movie is oddly torn between a depiction of an action movie and a social commentary.  Danila often offers money and assistance to the numerous poor of Russian society, who are now ignored in the post-Soviet glut of the influential and criminally rich.  Random scenes of Danila drinking with the poor in the cemetery and protecting the beggars and peddlers on the street are spread throughout the movie.  The action scenes are amusing due to Danila's insistence that only the mobsters be harmed, even to the point of murdering some of his own compatriots.  In the last scene, a viewer is surprised by the terminal civility of the Russian mobsters, who politely lie on the ground while Danila reloads his gun.

 Almost as a comic relief, and depiction of Danila's morals, are the attempts to find a certain song.  Although Danila frequents a solitary music store of St. Petersburg, he is never able to find this one song, yet always buys music.  This connection with music leads to his relationship with a cocaine addict and a tram operator, who are fellow fans that interact at a rock concert.

 Although it may not be an accurate crime movie by American cinema standards, nor a good social commentary of Russian society; Brother is a surprisingly good and entertaining movie.",1160438400,3,1278,4.847926267281106
1004919,3,6305285861,"Danila`s character was very interesting -the movie made me to think who was the real bad guy in this movie, Danila or his older brother. I think that the older brother really didn`t need to draw Danila into criminal life. He was comfortable with this life style from the beginning. He didn`t seem to have any problems to kill people and he didn`t show any remorse afterwards.

But there was still some good side left in him and I think that the music represented it. Danila became young and enthusiastic while listening music. That side of him was totally different than the cold-blooded killer.

I think this movie was quite realistic. It also showed some nice shots of the city of St. Petersburg even though the movie made the city look grey and depressing. But it fit to the plot very well, there wasn`t much light in these people's lives either.

In overall, the movie was quite good. Better than I expected.",1160265600,3,912,4.617283950617284

1004956,3,6305285861,"I wonder what Brother director Balabanov set out to make a film about, whatever it was it didn't come to pass. The movie starts up very canningly with our hero dressed for the lack of the better in his army uniform walking straight into a set of a pop music video as a stark contrast to the posh crew. In case you missed the conflict a fight with security guards ensues right away. OK, we get it - a regular Joe - sorry, Danila, ain't down with the new decadent and corrupt Russia. But his war-honed killer instincts are very much in place and in demand. The movie keeps on darting from an action thriller to a social commentary and never quite succeeds at being either one. It has it poignant moments - my favorite is when Danila gets bored during a botched hit and crashes a rock star's birthday party in an apartment couple of floors up, and then remembers he still has people to kill - but I never bought Danila as a super killer he made out to be in the movie. In Prisoner of the Mountains he was very much in the game as a naive conscript, captured by the rebels, but as a ultimate killing machine he is no more believable than a Mini Cooper with a 50 caliber machine gun on the roof somewhere in Faluja. There are actors who are born action heroes - like Gosha Kutsenko (AntiKiller) or Clive Owen (Croupier), very few can jump from a silly little hobbit to a nasty little cannibal, but Bodrov isn't one of them. So all things considered I give this one 3 out 5.",1135814400,,1468,4.246428571428571

1004958,5,6305285861,"Brother was one of those low budget action flicks that succeeded against all odds. The story itself was simple yet surprisingly effective. Danilla is a 23 year old kid just released from Russian military service. After loafing around his home town for a while, he travels to St. Petersburg to hook up with his older brother. But guess what: The brother is a mafia wiseguy, and he puts Dannila to work as a contract hitman. Weren't expecting that, were you?

What I loved about Brother is that Danilla is basically just a kid wants to get drunk, get laid, and listen to his favorite rock band. His responsibilities as a mafia hitman constantly get in the way of having a good time. It was as if he were working at McDonalds, and just wanted to get his shift over with so he could go party. There is something carefree and beautiful about the Danilla character, in spite of the fact that he is a killer and  an anti-semite. You can forgive all sorts of character flaws when someone is still young and trying to figure life out. Strictly from the picture on the DVD cover, one might assume that there is a HIGH probabibility that Brother is just another crappy shootem up action/mafia movie. What I saw was an excellent depiction of what its like to be in your early 20s - with performances even non-Russian audiences will appreciate.",1127520000,14,1331,4.564853556485356

1004960,4,6305285861,"Thematically similar to films like Pulp Fiction and Snatch (although the storytelling is refreshingly simpler), Brother chronicles Danila's (Sergei Bodrov) experiences when he sets forth to the Big City, in this case, St. Petersburg. He hooks up with his brother (Viktor Sukhorukov) who works as a hitman in that city.  Interesting things happen when he agrees to take on a job originally contracted for his brother.

And just like the two aforementioned films, Brother explores the seedy/sleazy underbelly of a big city by having Danila interact with various colorful characters.

Told in little vignettes with each scene fading in and out from black, director Alexei Balabanov gives us an involving narrative about the roguish Danila. Although he doesn't hesitate to cap other lowlifes (and a married woman's husband), use drugs, he goes out of his way to help and befriend the defenseless and protect those not involved in one of their contracts.  His code of honor makes him some sort of Russian Wise Guy/Robin Hood.

The movie also gives us a glimpse of post-Soviet Russia and how the West and its capitalist values has encroached the former Communist stronghold.  That (and the endearing performance of the actors, especially Sergei Budrov) makes the film worth watching, since the plotline is basically  a well-trodden path in Hollywood and British gangster cinema.

So if you're waiting for a Hollywood remake, don't. It isn't as groundbreaking as Hong Kong films, but with a liberal dose of grittiness, black humor and a not-your-usual-locale charm, it is still a very entertaining piece of world cinema.",1101340800,5,1613,5.2007722007722
1004961,3,6305285861,"Dark, brooding but ultimately not very satisfying movie, showing the underbelly of post-Soviet Russia.  Brodov became the bad boy of Russian cinema for his stone-faced portrayal of Danila, a young hood, schooled by his older brother, Viktor.  Balabonov revels in the violence of mob-ruled St. Petersburg, with plenty of footage of decayed city streets and the ruthless criminal world that had formed in the once great capital on the West Bank. But, don't expect very much irony here. The movie is underscored by an unremitting techno-music soundtrack that became painfully unbearable by movie's end.  Although, the movie was heralded as one of the first ""realistic"" portrayals of post-Soviet Russia, it seems to owe more to ""gangsta rap"" than it does the mean streets of Russia.",1088208000,4,778,5.208

He hears from his mother that his elder brother, Viktor in St. Petersburg, is doing well in business. Danila joins him and finds out that Viktor is in fact, a contract-killer. Soon Danila joins him in the trade and is drawn to the underworld... soon killing becomes natural to him... it's a simple plot, but shows the sad reality of post-Soviet Russia...
Sergei Bodrov, the beloved young Russian actor (who sadly passed away in an accident) carries Danila's role out well. The music, mostly by Nautilus Pompilius, brings out the mood in the film.
The sequel, Brother-2, is more entertaining, but much less realistic. There is plenty of nationalism and anti-Americanism there, but still worth to watch.",1052352000,11,907,5.093959731543624
