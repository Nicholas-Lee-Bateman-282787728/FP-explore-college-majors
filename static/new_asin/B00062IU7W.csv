8294674,5,B00062IU7W,"I don't own this, but I've seen all 3 veggie tales in this collection (or at least parts while kids are watching them). I'm reviewing this collection because there is so little info on what's in the value pack! I called Big Idea, and they couldn't help me because this is a discontinued item. So, get this deal while you can! There will not be anymore once Amazon runs out according to Big Idea customer service. I don't know for absolute sure, but according to the internets:

Value Pak 2 contains:
Veggie Tales: Josh and the Big Wall - A Lesson in Obedience
Veggie Tales: Rack, Shack & Benny - A Lesson in Handling Peer Pressure
Veggie Tales: Lyle the Kindly Viking - A Lesson in Sharing

I like this set better than value pack 1 myself. It's been a while since I've seen these, but I think I remember the Viking one being boring. But you certainly know you're getting good clean entertainment for your children with Veggie Tales. My 2 year old really likes them all. The price seems to fluctuate and sometimes this is a better value than buying this pack and sometimes it's cheaper to buy all 3 separate.

Just in case you wondering:
Value Pak 1 contains
Veggie Tales: Madame Blueberry - A Lesson in Thankfulness
Veggie Tales: King George and the Ducky - A Lesson About Selfishness
Veggie Tales: Esther - The Girl Who Became Queen

Some people seem to think a value pack 3 is coming, but seeing that 1 and 2 are discontinued, I doubt we'll be seeing 3.",1255651200,27,1455,4.438202247191011
