8738993,5,B003B56IBQ,"This program was produced by the University of Utah's KUED television station in 2002. Don't expect an overview of the whole story of the transcontinental railroad, as this program only delves into the relationship between the Mormons and the two railroads during the 1860s. This is not a story often told, and few people know the Mormons played such a big role in getting the rail line built through the Utah Territory. It goes into the details of Brigham Young's contracting work with both the Union Pacific and Central Pacific. Excellent for fans of Western, Mormon, or railroad history!",1454284800,,590,4.96969696969697
8738994,3,B003B56IBQ,"This DVD could have been much better if it hadn't focused so negatively on the politics of early Utah leaders such as Brigham Young. I bought it because I wanted to learn about the transcontinental railroad, not to be harangued about someone's anti-Mormon views.",1327536000,,262,4.9772727272727275
