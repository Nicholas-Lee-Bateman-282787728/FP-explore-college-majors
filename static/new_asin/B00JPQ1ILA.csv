6388505,5,B00JPQ1ILA,"Saw this movie at a DAR meeting and, especially as I spent 13 years in the USAF and had a grandmother who was an Army nurse during WWI, serving in France, just had to buy a copy. A very well made film, especially topical at the moment due to the recent decision (still being contested) that late members of the WASP are no longer allowed to be buried at Arlington Cemetery, despite the fact there is a section of that cemetery RESERVED for WASPS... And the fact that, despite the increasing number of women veterans, the VA has yet to make a real effort to hire more GYN doctors... I had always known we've had women serving in just about every conflict this country has been involved in, but this documentary brings out a lot of information I wasn't aware of. It also does a really great job covering the political and legal wrangles involved as women worked to be acknowledged as warriors capable of fighting as needed. Kudos to those involved in making this documentary a reality.",1461283200,3,983,4.52808988764045

6388509,4,B00JPQ1ILA,"I was expecting a documentary style film - like some behind the scenes information about female veterans and the role of women in battle through history.  This starts out as the kind of video you might see while touring a ""women in history"" exhibit touting the successes of women in the military in small bytes with little substance.  It touches a little bit on PTSD and rape but seems to minimize this in my opinion and goes right back to what appears to be a recruiting video.  It is valuable content, but fairly superficial.",1450656000,,527,4.585106382978723

6388512,5,B00JPQ1ILA,"A masterful,powerful look at the vital role women have played in America. Far beyond Rosie the Riveter,these remarkable,courageous, competent women gave so much,so unselfishly.

8652964,5,B00JPQ1ILA,"Very touching and impressive. It's a damn shame that these courageous women that served during WW2 did not get the recognition, honor and credit for their brave service by those in high places.
