7934435,5,B000059YSD,"After having had a friend demonstrate a few Pilates moves I was interested enough to buy this video.  It is, I believe, the most basic mat video in the Stott Pilates series.  I found the instructions clear and easy to follow, and the workout very approachable -- though as a real beginner, I couldn't do all the moves -- after two weeks I'm getting closer AND people are asking if I've lost weight (I haven't) and I take that as a good result.  If I were Stott pilates, I wouldn't have put the intimidating equipment moves in the introduction to the tape though -- it almost scared me off.  I like the tape enough to have ordered a few more and to be looking for a Pilates studio locally!

I felt Moira Stott gave a really nice lesson and, given the limitations of video, was quite encouraging.",1096156800,8,794,4.374149659863946
7934436,5,B000059YSD,"Since I live in NYC, I attend Pilates studio classes with instructors who are accredited through Stott's school. I was tickled to see one of my instructors in these tapes! This is an excellent supplement to core strengthening that is essential to Joseph Pilate's teachings. The review ""too little substance"" irked me, since he/she missed the entire point of this work. You cannot have core strength without proper breath and support. Posture, standing, even the way you sit will change with this type of exercise. Slow and steady is the way to go for injury prevention. If you want a mindless, sweaty workout (and a possible repetitive stress injury), stay at the gym. You will sweat with this workout, it's proper BREATHING that gets you there. Pilates is for thinking exercisers, not mindless hamsters huffing away on a stair stepper. After 2 knee surgeries, a hip that clicks, and a pinched nerve in my neck (all from dancing, skating, gymnastics and yes, stairmasters), I wouldn't think of returning to my gym. There is no need to keep pounding yourself into a sweaty heap once you change your view of exercise with these tapes. 3 times a week at 20 minutes minimum will give you the look, the feel, and the strength you need. Moira Stott (and her modifications) is a godsend.",1051056000,30,1280,4.796380090497737
7934437,4,B000059YSD,"This tape is designed for initial exposure to Pilates and its concepts.  They  must be under your belt in order to advance to the next level of exercises.  The reviewer who felt there was too little substance to these exercises MISSED the whole idea of Pilates.  If you just want to work out and sweat, Pilates is probably not for you anyway.  If you're willing to do the basics and get it under your belt, there is a wealth of information  available through Pilates.  This tape is designed to do just what it says, and does it well.",1036368000,26,533,4.377551020408164
