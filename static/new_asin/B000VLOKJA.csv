Keel was a really weak lead character to attempt to host the series off of but the strong supporting cast and a villain that the audience could truly sympathize with made this series have promise. Then they started talking and it all kind of went downhill from there. That is kind of a harsh statement but after the close of this series, I really am not sure that I am better off for having seen it. Some of the plot hooks along the way were interesting but three volumes of politics and strategy for an ending that barely pays off the investment leaves me feeling jaded. And now in the end, I can really say that you can do better than this series.",1213833600,,687,4.333333333333333
