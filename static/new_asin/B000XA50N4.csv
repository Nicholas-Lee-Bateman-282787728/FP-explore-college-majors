3000309,4,B000XA50N4,"I chose this as one of the small Christmas presents to give to my daughter who is the mother of our grandaughter. We all have loved it and it is humor that can be listened to again and again.  It also would be very good for any women's fellowship.  I am sure my daughter will get much use out of it with women in her church and at work.  Her husband is a church pastor and she is a nurse.

3000311,5,B000XA50N4,"Oh why oh why did I not buy her DVD's there! I have been kicking myself ever since! I laughed, I cried, I could relate! I am reading her book, and that is good too! You will not be sorry!",1193875200,13,187,3.7
3000312,5,B000XA50N4,"This CD had me laughing out loud. Talent is when you can be somewhat tasteful and still get a laugh. I had my husband listen to the ""Momsense"" song and he even got a big kick out of it.",1335312000,,185,3.769230769230769
3000313,5,B000XA50N4,"After a very stressful week, I put this in the portable DVD player, put on some headphones, and put the kids in front of Sesame Street. It was a wonderful stress relief to laugh so much. I literally laughed until I cried. If you are a mom, and have a sense of humor, this DVD is quite therapeutic.",1306627200,,297,4.137931034482759
3000314,5,B000XA50N4,Again invite your friends to enjoy this with you!  This kind of humor is meant to be shared! (and so is her message!),1289952000,,117,4.086956521739131
3000315,5,B000XA50N4,"She is hillarious!
It is so nice to have great clean women jokes...you sit at laugh at yourself in some of the things she talks about it!

We watched this at a women's get together for church. I had to go home and order it for my personal collection.",1256169600,,250,4.1020408163265305
3000316,5,B000XA50N4,I love love love this DVD.  Anita keeps it clean but has a great time laughing and making me laugh.  It is a must have.,1256169600,,119,3.72
3000317,5,B000XA50N4,She is hilarious!  The whole family can watch and the whole family will laugh!!!  Quality entertainment.,1237766400,,104,5.4375
3000318,5,B000XA50N4,"I bought this DVD because I had seen the William Telle Overture ""Mom Song"" on U Tube, and loved it.  The whole DVD is great- refreshingly clean, family friendly comedy",1212364800,,167,4.566666666666666
3000319,5,B000XA50N4,If you're a mom (especially one with young children) you will laugh.  Nice clean fun.,1212192000,,85,4.666666666666667
3000320,5,B000XA50N4,This was a fun video we watched at my Mothers of Preschoolers group. We all laughed so hard! I can't wait to watch it again and share it with friends.,1212019200,,150,4.033333333333333
3000321,5,B000XA50N4,"Anita Renfroe rocks!  If laughter is the best medicine, I should be healthier each time I watch this movie.",1210291200,2,107,4.631578947368421
3000322,5,B000XA50N4,"If you're a mom, are going to become a mom, or HAVE a mom, then this DVD is for you. Anita Renfroe takes the common everyday stuff and makes you see it in a funny way. Her ""Momisms"" song sung to The William Tell Overture -- about what a mom says to a kid in a 24-hour period, is worth the price of the DVD alone. This is terrific comedy without the brainless swearing thrown in for shock value. Gather your mom-friends to watch and laugh your fool heads off.",1209686400,,458,4.1
3000323,5,B000XA50N4,This video is just hilarious.  I laughed so hard as she made me see myself in so many fun ways.  It is good clean fun with NOTHING objectionable.  My teenage boys even thought she was funny. Great fun to watch for a girls' night.,1209686400,2,229,4.159090909090909
3000324,3,B000XA50N4,I wish I had had this 4 years ago. I believe the momsense song seems more funny every time I hear it. The rest of the video really is geared to new moms.,1204502400,3,153,3.6666666666666665
3000325,5,B000XA50N4,"I went to the 2007 Women of Faith Conference in Denver and thought I might have an accident in the middle of a laughing spasm when Anita was on the stage.  She did all her best stuff.  Between MOMSENSE and DON'T BREATHE I lost all composure.  This DVD has the MOMSENSE song that has been circulated around on the Internet, and the music video of the DON'T BREATHE song that she did at the conference, scattered amist an hour or so of tons of other funny stuff.  If you buy only one Anita Renfroe DVD BUY THIS ONE!!!!!  It is my favorite!!!!",1203379200,,540,4.254901960784314
3000326,5,B000XA50N4,"This DVD was wonderful. I shared it with my Pilates teacher, whose mom is a preacher's wife... she LOVED it and bought one for herself. My daughter and daughter-in-law LOVED it and I bought one for each of them for Valentine's Day. This video is great christian comedy and I highly recommend it. My daughter said she needs to watch her copy at least once a week. It is very uplifting. I loved all of the anecdotes. I plan to buy more copies as gifts for baby showers, birthday gifts, etc. for my friends.",1203033600,,504,4.372340425531915
3000327,5,B000XA50N4,"Anita Renfroe is laugh therapy.  She talks about real life in a way that will make your ribs hurt from laughter.  Her 1812 Overture musical parody is straight from real life and goes straight to your laugh reflex as you recognize yourself, your friends, your mom etc.  I highly recommend this product.",1202774400,2,301,4.75
3000328,5,B000XA50N4,"I am a guy but this DVD is great.  I bought it for my wife, but find I am repeatedly sharing it with women I know  -- co-workers, relatives, friends, etc.  If all you do is see the part set to the William Tell Overture (Lone Ranger Theme), or listen to the Botox Song, which is poorly named but wonderfully done, then the DVD is worth it.",1202428800,,338,4.014925373134329
3000329,3,B000XA50N4,"I saw Anita at a Women of Faith conference and she had me in tears, so I bought this DVD. Maybe my expectations were too high? I watched it with my husband, so maybe that's why I didn't find it as funny as I might have if I were with a group of women. A friend of mine who runs MOPS meetings (Mothers of Preschoolers) said her group thought it was hysterical. I thought her spoken comedy was so-so, but her songs are very funny.",1201478400,6,428,4.047058823529412
3000330,5,B000XA50N4,"This was a gift for my wife, who loved it.  Anita Renfroe is talented, funny, and an entertaining observer of the issues that moms face in life. My wife's favorite part was Renfroe's rendition of all the cliches a mom uses throughout the day to the tune of ""The William Tell Overture"".",1199664000,,285,4.480769230769231
3000331,5,B000XA50N4,"I first watched this video at the Mother-Daughter banquet at our church last May.  Very funny, true and hilarious!  Many of us wished to share this with our co-workers, and patients.  What a wonderful way to look at life!

Anita is Awesome!
I think women will love it more than men, since men have not given birth, and her take on pregnancy and delivery are hilarious.

8227650,2,B000XA50N4,My wife had this on her wishlist and I decided to buy it for her.  We are always looking for comedy that is not raunchy and may be watched with the whole family.  Anita seemed to fit the bill.  The beginning of the dvd is quite annoying with her singing a LONG song that is neither funny nor entertaining.  After a few minutes of being subjected to this song it did not end so we fast forwarded the rest...and it took quite awhile!  We watched the entire program and barely laughed.  The most entertaining part was at the end when she did a parody of a Faith Hill song.  Overall we were disappointed and don't even think it is worth watching a second time.  If you are looking for good family quality comedy that is FUNNY look at Tim Hawkins!!  I own 4 of his dvd's and we watch them over and over.  If you have never seen one of his comedy routines you will not be disappointed...unlike this terrible dvd!,1388534400,,906,4.245614035087719
