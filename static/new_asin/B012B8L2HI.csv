8725798,3,B012B8L2HI,"This film is an odd combination of a Disney dance TV movie and a teen sex comedy. I was expecting the former, and was surprised by the latter. Five high school kids who have a tight click opt to go to CHROME, a teen dance club. When they get there, they are denied entrance because Sean (Franz Drameh) happens to be the brother of Alex (Alex Lanipekun) which leads to an improbable background tale. The five teens decide to open their own club in a warehouse. They eventually get help from the reluctant Alex, a stripper (Olivia Chenery) and some muscle (Tom Davis) in what amounted to a poorly conceived plot just so they can have half a film of hard bodied young adults jumping up and down having a good time.

I am sure there is a niche of teens that this film will appeal to, especially with the sex and full frontal nudity, both male and female (Penny Dreadful's  Olivia Cherery, Sasha Bayer, Victoria Beth, plus others)

3 stars for the nudity.",1442620800,,950,4.448275862068965
