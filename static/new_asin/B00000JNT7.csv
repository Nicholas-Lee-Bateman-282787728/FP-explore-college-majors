7912963,5,B00000JNT7,Fascinating look at how a beloved movie was filmed.,1410998400,,51,4.777777777777778
7912964,4,B00000JNT7,"This movie was a lot of fun and very moving to watch.  It has interviews with Norman Maclean's son and daughter and also with Robert Redford who produced and directed, and Brad Pitt who plays the narrator's younger brother.  The sound and picture quality were not high, but for lovers of the novel and movie, this documentary is well worth having.",1399680000,,347,4.672131147540983
7912965,5,B00000JNT7,"This documentary made the rounds when A River Runs Through It was in theaters. As films in the ""making of"" genre go, it is one of the finest. Of particular interest, beyond the usual artist hype, are the interviews with Norman Maclean's children on the significance of the novella in their father's long-postponed grieving process for his brother's death. They are very touching insights into the stoic young man portrayed in the movie. I've seen a lot of these kinds of shows, and this remains a standout of usefulness that survives the temporary popularity of underlying theater release.",1165622400,,589,5.020408163265306
7912966,1,B00000JNT7,I AM A MARKETPLACE SELLER. I purchased several dozen copies of this DVD for resale last year for $2.00 each at my local Kroger store. This movie is nothing but a headache. It is a LOW QUALITY budget film that half the time doesn't work. I have had more negative feedback from this title than any product I have ever sold... and I didn't even make the darn thing. I have urged my customers to review the product HERE. Rating a seller for a poor product that they did not make does not help future customers... only a product review like this one. So PLEASE make sure you write a review if you don't like this film. As for the 20 or so copies I have left... donation to a thrift store. Bye Bye.,1136332800,,692,4.1716417910447765
