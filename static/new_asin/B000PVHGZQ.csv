I don't remember it being called Imprisoned women it was just ""Caged without a key""I just hope that it does go to dvd soon. Another movie starring Susan Dey that I can't find is when she played a unstable mother on the verge of killing her only child. During the movie she is seeing a theopist for being bipolar which back then they knew little on how to treat it but, towards the end she's losing it a trying to call for help but can't find it and ends up murdering her baby girl. I Don't remember the name of it. I think it was call Mary Jane doesn't live here any more. If anyone knows I'd like to find out. N.D",1317081600,5,729,4.0344827586206895

Doe-eyed, fresh-faced Susan Dey, plays Valerie Smith. Valerie is a very naive teen. She gets involved in a robbery/murder, after accepting a ride from a strange boy. He forces Valerie to help him rob a store at gunpoint, and he winds-up killing someone in the process.

Even though she was unwillingly involved in the crime, Valerie gets sentenced to a stretch in a Juvenile prison facility. The severity of her sentence is absurd, considering that Valerie had no prior criminal history. I thought that this seriously undermined the credibility, of the film's whole storyline.

Once inside the Juvenile facility, Valerie is engaged in a bewildering struggle to adjust to her new surroundings. Valerie's told from the get-go by the other inmates, that she must choose which clique to belong to. This is to ensure her survival in the 'joint'.

The inmates are a motley crew of tough, hardened young women. The members of the 'good' clique, take Valerie under their wing, showing her the 'ropes' of prison life. They also offer Valerie protection from the clique rivalries, that sometimes result in violence. A member of Valerie's clique, even rescues her from being unwillingly ravished, by an intensely amorous lesbian inmate.

The prison staff, don't seem to be able to control the chaotic environment. Valerie and her fellow inmates, are forced to rely solely on the support of their cliques, to negotiate prison life. The lawyers procured by Valerie's parents, are amazingly inept at helping make a case to free Valerie. Unable to depend on being proved innocent, Valerie becomes ever-deeply entrenched in the violent prison culture, which results in senseless tragedy.

Imprisoned Women is a powerful film. I was surprised to see such a raw, hard-hitting drama, on network TV during the 70s. It is at times, rather melodramatic. Overall though, it has some strong performances. Especially Susan Dey, as the hapless Valerie Smith. If you liked those 70s movie-of-the-week films about teens in jeopardy, then I'd recommend seeing Imprisoned Women.",1261872000,7,2225,5.149584487534626

When i received it, it was recorded in the SP mode. When i started to watch it, the video quality was horrible!!!! Nice work MCM Entertainment! Why bother? If you don't mind watching this great movie with far less than good quality, by all means buy yourself a copy. For me, i will hope it comes on television again someday and set my TIVO to record it. I would have rather done a review concerning the movie itself and Susan Dey's great performance. Instead i felt you should be warned about the tape itself.",1230940800,9,637,4.406779661016949
