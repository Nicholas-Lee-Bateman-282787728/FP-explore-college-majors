5159150,4,B008FYZJ0O,"I had searched for years for a copy of ""Foreign Intrigue"" as, for unknown reason, it was not generally available in the Mitchum offerings.  The price was right, with this one!  Admittedly  the story is dated, but the setting and the scenery are of interest.  The second movie is, I think, miscast, awkward and confusing---held little interest, hence 4 stars.  I'm delighted to be able to add the Mitchum work to my collection, though.",1387324800,,434,4.8108108108108105
5159151,5,B008FYZJ0O,"I saw Foreigh Intrigue many years ago and was most interested in having it in my collection of Robert Mitchum movies.
I have enjoyed his movies 90% of the time... he always does a good job of the story (perhaps only the story is not always good) but he does a thoroughly professional job.",1373328000,,288,4.351851851851852
5159152,2,B008FYZJ0O,"According to the DVD case Mitchum owns the copyright for this film, so this was his baby, with its implausible storyline. Mitchum plays a press agent to one of the world's richest men, who gets a heart attack and dies just as Mitchum reaches him. A number of events encourages Mitchum to investigate the background of his dead boss, but over the objections of the younger widow. Several people want to know if Mitchum heard any last words from the deceased--he died merely groaning. Also, a lawyer from Vienna wants an official death certificate to verify that the millionaire died of natural causes so he can destroy  a letter in his custody. Mitchum is on his way to Vienna to examine the letter. But others are now in pursuit of Mitchum, to either prevent him from getting the letter or to obtain it for their own ends. Along the way we learn that the dead millionaire made his fortune by blackmailing other millionaires, who were traitors to the their country during the Nazi period. The letter in Vienna will reveal the names of the traitors, and was to be made public only if the millionaire  died of unnatural causes.

What makes this movie unsatisfactory? First, the story line is not plausible: a bunch of pro Nazi super rich wannabe Gauleiters waiting for a conquest which never came. After the war they are now willing to be blackmailed in the millions of dollars to hid their failed ambitions. The plot might have been stronger if one or more of the traitors were portrayed in the film. In addition to  a silly storyline, the movie is weak on the supporting characters, most of whom are played by unknown European actors. Finally, the ending is contrived and unsatisfying with no real resolution of the plot line involving the letter. Did the film run out of money requiring a quick ending?

Both Foreign Intrigue and The Quiet America are available only with this single disc. The latter is the first film version of the Graham Green novel  made in 1958 with Audie Murphy as the naive American do-gooder and  Michael Redgrave as the cynical, weary British journalist. The film takes place in French Indochina, during the Communist insurgency but years before America's military involvement in Vietnam. The film is worth watching if only for Redgrave's performance.",1368057600,3,2277,4.793367346938775
5159153,4,B008FYZJ0O,"Agree with all the previous reviews on these two titles.  Excellent price for two forgotten classics.  As for the DVD authoring:  ""Foreign Intrigue"" (color) is widescreen 16X9.  ""The Quiet American"" (black & white) is also widescreen BUT is letterboxed within a 4X3 picture frame.  This means there are black bars on all four sides of the image.  This presentation is NOT anamorphic 16X9 and therefore, does not fill the entirety of an HD 16X9 television screen.",1363478400,,462,5.0131578947368425
5159154,5,B008FYZJ0O,"This is a great double feature of two 50s movies starring Robert Mitchum and Audie Murphy. First of all, the quality of the images are great with both of them being in Widescreen. There are no special features, trailers, no other languages (subtitle and audio) and only one sided disk. TGG Direct has some deal with MGM & Fox to put some titles on DVD and they haven't disappoint me yet. ""Foreign Intrigue"" (1956/color/100mins), stars; Robert Mitchum, Genevive Page, Ingrid Thulin, Frdric O'Brady and Eugene Deckers. ""The Quiet American"" (1958/b&w/122mins), stars; Audie Murphy, Michael Redgrave, Claude Dauphin, Giorgia Moll, Bruce Cabot and Richard Loo.

5159155,4,B008FYZJ0O,"TGG, a distributor known for re-releasing a number of films in the MGM catalog with often shoddy results, presents a pair of surprisingly cerebral thrillers from the late 1950s in this single-disc set.

First up, the generically titled 'Foreign Intrigue' (premiering on a Region 1 DVD) is actually a very stylish, Sheldon Reynolds-produced Technicolor mystery-noir that owes much of its appeal-- via quirky characterizations, rich and exotic locales, glamorous women, the juxtaposition of peril and humor and the use of abstract camera angles in service of a red-herring-filled plot-- to Hitchcock.  Lead Robert Mitchum rarely has embodied the kind of vitality he showcases here; it's his 'Charade' and, as such, is lots of shifty fun.  4-plus stars.

Second we have Joseph Mankiewicz's adaptation of Graham Greene's 'The Quiet American.'  It's a fantastic Cold War character study that skewers the West's Communist-sympathizing intelligentsia and its unwillingness to distinguish propaganda from truth.  Having read the book, I can say that this version is decidedly more pro-American than Greene intended, but it's Michael Redgrave's performance as the sublimely arrogant and cynical newspaperman Fowler-- perhaps only outdone by his turn as tragically immasculated academician Crocker-Harris in Asquith's superb 'The Browning Version'-- that makes this an overlooked classic.  Also earns 4-plus stars.

Unfortunately, while offering a decent-looking anamorphic-widescreen picture, the source print for FI is littered with artifacts; TQA appears to be the same reasonably sharp b&w transfer (non-anamorphic 1.66:1 letterbox) found on MGM's original 2005 release.  Each could use a thorough restoration.  3 1/2 stars for presentation (sorry, no extras).",1357776000,16,1754,5.81640625
5159156,5,B008FYZJ0O,"Especially at this steal of a price.  ""Quiet American"" (the 1958 version here, not to be confused with the recent remake) has been issued on DVD in the U.S., but not ""Foreign Intrigue.""  Excellent widescreen transfers.  Keep 'em coming, MGM-UA!",1352505600,9,244,5.05
5159157,2,B008FYZJ0O,"Foreign Intrigue & The Quiet American, DVD

This product has two lesser known movies from the late 1960s. They are mysteries of intrigue set in foreign countries with an American working there. They are philosophical, more talk than action. They have interesting scenes of the foreign country where the story is located, but parts seem implausible (except to create a story).

Foreign Intrigue (1956). It starts at a big estate and the mansion of a wealthy philanthropist. Victor Danimore dies of a heart attack, he is found by his publicist Dave Bishop. People want to know if he said anything before he died. His young widow Dominique does not mourn. Where did Victors money come from? Did he blackmail powerful men? Where did he get this knowledge? Dave goes to Vienna and meets a man. Spring wants to work with him. Is he a threat? Dave goes to Stockholm to interview one man, but he cant talk. Dominique meets Dave and wants to meet him at lunch. Dave meets six men who take him to a basement and reveal a secret. They want Dave to work with Spring so they can find his employer. This has an overly complex plot and an implausible story. Can one man be so powerful he can control peoples thinking and lives?

The Quiet American (1958). This is set in 1952 Saigon where rebel Vietnamese are fighting for their independence. A body is found on a river bank (note the white socks). The police question Fowler, a British journalist. In the recent past the American (Pyle) met Fowler and his friend Phuong. The conversation tells of their attitudes. A romantic triangle develops. Fowler visits the front lines to report on the war; so does Pyle. Later Pyle offers Phuong a better life, something Fowler cant do (he has a wife back in England). Fowler is told a story about Pyles plastics and asked to arrange a meeting with Pyle at night. The police know Pyle was murdered on his way to this meeting. Inspector Vigot questions Fowler. In the end Phuong leaves Fowler, and Vigot tells him how he was fooled and used. [It doesnt give any motive, the book must have been better, its story was changed for this movie.]",1426723200,,2114,4.617021276595745

5159159,4,B008FYZJ0O,"If you wanted a couple of film noir classics from the 1950s, ""Foreign Intrigue"" with American legend, Robert Mitchum, and ""The Quiet American"" with the late Sir Michael Redgrave are two great intelligent films and long are ignored by today's standards. The first film, ""Foreign Intrigue,"" is shot in lovely color with strong female characters (a rarity in the 1950s Hollywood). Mitchum's character, Bishop, is sent on a mystery about his late mysterious employer to Stockholm, Sweden and Vienna, Austria. Along the way, he meets colorful characters like the blind charwoman in Vienna and Mrs. Lindquist and her attractive daughter in Stockholm. Along the way, Bishop needs to be stopped in finding out the truth. It's a good film noir film in color.

The second film, ""The Quiet American,"" is adapted by British writer, Graham Greene's novel of the same name. The film stars the late great Sir Michael Redgrave as the British cynical journalist who feels guilt over the murder of the American businessman in Saigon, Vietnam. There is a believable love triangle among the two men over Phuong, the French Vietnamese woman, who comes between them. This film is shot in beautiful black and white and on location in Saigon, Vietnam before the Vietnam War.

There are no extra features in this DVD about the two films.",1420761600,,1312,4.986301369863014

5159165,4,B008FYZJ0O,"The movie, Foreign Intrigue, follows a five year television run of the same title. Sheldon Reynolds, who had co-produced the series with Gerald Mohr in the leading role, directed and co-wrote the film version with Harold Jack Bloom and Gene Levitt. There are moments in this thriller when one might be made to think of Carol Reeds The Third Man (1949); there is the same kind of unidentified guilt hanging over some persons we see and most we never meet. Like The Third Man, Foreign Intrigue wraps arcane dialogue like a cord around its subject until something and someone gives up the ghost.
How we love when Robert Mitchum barges into other peoples business and plods along stubbornly towards answers, rarely with light and as rarely with apologies. Photographer Bertil Palmgrens reminds one as well of Carol Reeds post-war Vienna in those after-dark scenes in dismal quarters. Then he plays a neat trick at the climax of subduing Eastmancolor to create a noir-ish, almost black-and-white effect as we peer down upon a lighted street lamp from the vantage point of a high-angle camera.
There is nothing wanting in the entire cast. From top to bottom the ensemble isas they sayto die for.
Along with his successful Foreign Intrigue series, Sheldon Reynolds had, from 1954-to-1955, produced thirty-nine magnificent Sherlock Holmes programs with Ronald Howard and Howard Marion-Crawford; now, for this enterprise, he showed again his good sense in going to the stable of that series for three ultimately reliable character actors: the always delightful Frdric O'Brady, as Jonathan Spring, the chimerical Eugene Deckers, as Pierre Sandoz, and the graceful Peter Copley, as Brown.
Foreign Intrigue, arguably not the work of art as is The Third Man, is inarguably a solid achievement and a thoroughly good picture.",1399161600,,1810,5.138983050847457

8527515,3,B008FYZJ0O,"Foreign Intrigue: This is the Third Man with a bad script, bad directing, one decent actor with no good lines and a terrible sound track.  Robert Mitchum plays a man seeking the truth about his suddenly dead and mysterious employer. Mitchum was the dead mans press agent and knew nothing about him. Across the movie he is able to uncover nothing except what people suddenly tell him. Having run the story into nowhere except a glued-in love at first sight romance, the plot suddenly becomes the one from North by Northwest. Flat, dull and not recommended.

The Quiet American was supposed to be a break out serious role for Medal of Honor Winner Audie Murphy.  His performance is fairly good given that the actor was about to rupture his appendix. Much of it was filmed in what was then French Indochina, what we would come to know as Viet Nam. The movie is set during the communist revolution that was In fact happening as the movie was filming. His co star was Michael Redgrave. Clearly the better actor. The original story was written by Graham Green. The plot only seems predictable especially because it starts with the end. Murphys character murdered. Learning the solution to this crime does not finish the story.

The Quiet American is a decent film. There is much about it that makes it worth at least one viewing. I may even decide to keep the DVD despite the terrible other movie.",1479772800,,1391,4.66530612244898

8527517,2,B008FYZJ0O,"This was the worse Foreign Intrigue movie I have ever seen.  It is nothing but a triangle love story between Audie Murphy, Michael Redgrave and a Vietnam actress I have never heard of.  Michael Redgrave was so annoying running after a girl years younger than himself and Audie Murphy was miscast in the part of the intruding lover of this girl.  In black and white, and the many, many numerous crowd scenes that were so boring after awhile, it was headache producing.  Claude Dauphin as the French Detective was the best actor and most convincing in the whole film.  The one good thing about it, was since it started in 1952, it explained the troubles of Vietnam and the various countries that were helping fight the takeover by the Communists.  Action was not convincing and the story was juvenile.",1465430400,,799,4.712230215827338

8527519,4,B008FYZJ0O,"Both of these films were shot mostly 'on location', and each film has rather effective film noir-ish elements that held my interest.

""Foreign Intrigue"" stars Robert Mitchum, who plays the press agent to a wealthy man with a mysterious past.  When his employer dies, Mitchum crosses Europe in his attempt to discover who he really was, how he accumulated his fortune, and why so many people asked him what the millionaire's last words were.  Ultimately, Mitchum's character enters into a world of blackmail and espionage on his personal quest to uncover the truth. Moody, mysterious, but a little on the slow side with an unsatisfying ending. Locations are France (The Riviera) Stockholm and Vienna.

""The Quiet American"" stars Michael Redgrave and Audie Murphy. Murphy does a creditable job of acting portraying the representative of an unnamed U.S. agency (suspect the CIA in this case) in French Indochina. He meets up with a jaded British journalist (Michael Redgrave) who has a young Vietnamese girlfriend/lover with whom Murphy becomes smitten. Thus begins a tale of the Infernal Triangle. Set in 1952 Saigon (filmed there in 1958), the communist insurgency serves as important background to the lovers' struggle over the woman.  Redgrave is superb.",1459382400,,1255,5.223880597014926
