I like to have my kids watch these when they wake up from nap and are having a snack.  It's the perfect amount of time for that.  Worth the money.",1516147200,,311,3.873015873015873

8150846,5,B000JJ4W88,"This topic is down exceptionally well by the Nest organization.  It is Biblically accurate and sensitively portrayed.  The loving attitude of the Moabite Ruth in traveling back to Naomi's family in the land of Israel from having lived many years in Moab is faithfully presented.  It was a clear attention holder for my wife's first grade class, when she used it to cover this wonderful story of integrity and faithfulness within a family that had been thought destroyed by the death of a husband and sons-in-law.  Highly recommended!",1429401600,2,533,5.0227272727272725

8150849,5,B000JJ4W88,"My little granddaughters like to watch this movie.  It had some pictures that really told the story
well; their home and how poor they were.  Boaz and his care for Ruth and Naomi was touching throughout the end of the story.  Bible stories are so good for children in the world we live in.",1349827200,6,289,4.314814814814815
