5751916,4,B00CYLRQDW,"EL MARIACHI GRINGO is a little film with a quiet but sincere message. It is obviously a low budget film based on a screenplay by Cory Krueckenberg and directed sympathetically by Tom Gustafson, both men rather new to these two role assignments. The reason the film works is the sense of honesty about it.

The film opens in Kansas were life is rather boring, especially for a 30-year-old young man Edward (Shawn Ashmore), on some medication for what seems to be a form of mental illness, who still lives with his parents (Kate Burton and Tom Wopat) and has not found a direction for his life.  He has studied music, plays the guitar occasionally, and one day he wanders into a town Mexican restaurant called El Mariachi where he is befriended by Rosario (Yareli Arizmendi) and Alberto (Fernando Becerril) who plays guitar and sings to the customers. Alberto shares his basement model of the city of Guadalajara where he recalls singing with the Mariachis in Mariachi Square who simply make a living singing for the people to help them celebrate their lives. Edward absorbs the dream of playing music for the people, takes lessons in Mariachi from Alberto, settles with his disapproving parents, and is off to Mexico. At first out of place in Guadalajara he soon meets Lilia (the very beautiful and talented Martha Higareda) working in her mother Magdalena's (Adriana Barraza) caf. With Lilia (who had studied in Santa Cruz, CA and longs to go back to her dream) and Mariachi singer Sophia (Lila Downs) he is introduced to the field of real Mariachi singing, becomes accepted as the Gringo Mariachi, wins some fame, but after a brief trip back to Kansas for an unexpected funeral, Edward returns to Guadlajara to find things have changed - but he still has followed his dream and is quietly happy.

There are significant subplots that aren't well explored, but the film does not try to be anything it isn't - it is just about following your dreams no matter the obstacles or consequences or surprises. The cast is competent, the music is a highlight, and the take away feeling is one of tenderness and caring. Grady Harp, September 13",1379808000,9,2133,4.790760869565218
5751917,4,B00CYLRQDW,"A charming exploration of a gringo's love of mariachi music and Mexican culture.  This film could have been a clichd hack job but instead surprised me several times.  Well-worth watching, if nothing more than for the photography of Guadalajara.",1379721600,,244,5.230769230769231
5751918,5,B00CYLRQDW,"Highly recommended.  Wonderful performances and a story that is a breath of fresh air.  The protagonist goes from a life of jello molds and blandness to a life of color, music and exciting tastes.  A metaphor for anyone who feels like their life is going nowhere and how taking a leap of faith can take you from a black and white existence to a technicolor world.  From Kansas to Guadalajara (a stand-in for Oz).  And the story is unpredictable in the best possible ways, which makes it all the more refreshing.  The film is worth it's weight in gold for the music alone.  And for Lila Downs.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1376265600,5,631,4.333333333333333
5751919,2,B00CYLRQDW,"The trailer for this hinted that there was some sort of romance <showing the  lead characters in bed> ***spoiler alert**** though the lead actors are watchable, don't expect the chemistry to work....the guy does seem to be crushing on the girl, but she's gay. The ending was rather odd. both characters follow their dreams but it's not presented very well. Disappointing overall. more music than dialogue, which works for this film, but it really would have been better if they had written more meaningful relationships with a more typical tidy  ending.",1375747200,,553,5.065934065934066
5751920,5,B00CYLRQDW,"I saw the movie three times. Because I LOVE to see the Mxico I missed  a lot. I really enjoy the great meaning of this movie. I recommend to everybody who like sweet movies, to see this one.",1373760000,4,190,4.0
5751921,5,B00CYLRQDW,"I don't normally review movies on here, but I saw that one star review and couldn't believe someone would give this one star.  This movie has great acting, great story about discovery and finding oneself.  It also shows the beauty of Mexico and the meaning of Mariachi.  If you are not comfortable with reading subtitles, don't rent it.  If you know Spanish, then you are in luck.  A lot of the dialogue is in Spanish when he reaches Mexico.  I couldn't believe what I had just seen, and not afraid to admit I cried at the end.  Well done, I will buy this movie when it comes out.

*Side Note*  I originally rented this movie from Redbox because it said Comedy.  I thought to myself, what could be more funny than a white guy trying to be a Mariachi, right?  THIS IS NOT A COMEDY.  In the end I was glad it wasn't a comedy, because it is a great movie.",1373328000,7,852,4.22360248447205
5751922,5,B00CYLRQDW,"Awesome movie , great homage to Jorge Negrete. If you enjoy Mexican music and Lila Downs this movie is for you. Great performances by all in this picture. Lila Downs doing Paloma Negra not to be missed. Shawn Ashmore doing Jalisco no te Rajes. Jorge Negrete would be proud of this Mariachi Gringo",1373328000,4,296,4.60377358490566
5751923,1,B00CYLRQDW,"Bad acting, bad writing, bad social message. The story is a boring, immature, and depressing premise, and the director takes forever to develop it. Needless attacks on faith to boot. What more is there to say? Don't waste your time.",1373155200,,232,4.825
5751924,5,B00CYLRQDW,A gem for all to see. Totally in the tradition of Mariachi movies of the black and white classics! Jose Alfredo Jimenez would be proud and Lila Downs was unsurpassable.,1370044800,5,168,4.633333333333334

5751928,2,B00CYLRQDW,"This is a strange movie that is good for someone who likes mariachi. The story isn't really that deep and the ending is pretty lame which leaves you wondering, what the heck did i just watch? Its a decent at best movie, Its heartfelt and emotional at times but its by no means a good movie. Worth a watch if you really loke mariachi and mexico, if not, then skip it.",1417996800,,366,4.169014084507042
5751929,5,B00CYLRQDW,"This a great movie for anyone exposed and appreciative of the guitar, interested in traditional Mariachi music, & the beauty of another culture that has been historically maligned by Hollywood. If these qualities fit you, you gotta see this movie. Finally, we are exposed to positive aspects of Mexican culture in a meaningful, thoughtful way. Not that this movie doesn't show some negative characters (the effort to rob Ashmore's character in Mexico is an example, the conflict between parents and child, etc.).
Those that give this movie a thumbs down are culturally blind. The wonders of the world around us is our diversity. I will buy the DVD & the soundtrack.",1417737600,,665,5.0
5751930,5,B00CYLRQDW,"Mariachi Gringo is an entertaining movie with great music that actually turns the stale ""American Dream"" trope on its head and highlights an atypical ""Mexican Dream"" storyline. With strong acting, a solid script and a very definite sense of place, this movie pays homage to an aspect of Mexican culture that few people truly appreciate. If ""Mariachi music"" conjures images of the obnoxious musicians in a bad Mexican restaurant, this movie can provide a satisfying alternative through a nice, non-traditional narrative. Ultimately the movie is about one man finding his calling in a very unexpected place, and I found it inspiring! For anyone who is curious about Mexican culture (beyond the typical California/Hollywood archetype), Mariachi music, or who loves Lila Downs voice, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie!",1417651200,,823,5.290076335877862

5751936,5,B00CYLRQDW,"I saw this movie at a film festival and fell in love with its story, characters, and the dream of a young man pursuing that which brings him joy. It's about believing in yourself and taking that giant leap to see your life mean something to you. The move is colorful with rich settings in Mexico and lots of wonderful mariachi music. Highly recommend this movie!",1397865600,2,362,4.5
5751937,5,B00CYLRQDW,"This was a very interesting film, set in Guadalajara, Mexico. It was about a midwestern gringo kid. He played guitar,  loved Mariachi music. He ends up in to mexico to join a band. An odd love affair holds the story line together. The music is great, if you like Mariachi music. It's not the usual canned violent American movie full of foul language and shootemups. It's a coming of age story, if anything. Very interesting and different movie.",1392076800,4,444,4.6923076923076925
5751938,4,B00CYLRQDW,"When I first read the title I also was thinking the film would be a comedy. There were some humorous parts too but it's prettty much a drama about a man finding himself in a very unlikely place. The story's fun and will make you want to go to Mexico to hear the wonderful music yourself. For the music ,to me, is the real draw in the film. There is some great Mariachi songs and lots of Lila Downs. She's amazing and really gets a chance to show her talents as a singer of Mexican songs. If you are a Lila Downs fan you will want to own this film. I hope she has the opportunity to act and sing more films. She does both very well.",1392076800,6,631,3.9763779527559056
5751939,5,B00CYLRQDW,This shows the culture of the mariachi and how noble the real ones are. This gringo paid the price and put in the needed work to become a mariachi.,1390176000,2,147,4.103448275862069
5751940,5,B00CYLRQDW,"What a healthy experience this is. I am developing such an affection for Mexico. This really hit the spot for me. The story is great. It's beautiful to look at. It is educational on many fronts, from psychology to politics. The music is wonderful. Brilliant pleasure. I will see it again with loved ones, including the Gringo grandchildren. It was on Cinemax in HD. There should be a Blu-ray issued. I will buy the dvd from Amazon as a gift.",1389571200,,441,4.525
5751941,4,B00CYLRQDW,I was surprised to hear a Gringo playing and singing Mariachi.  He did a great job I must say.  If your a fan of Lila Downs I would recommend you watch this movie.  And not to mention just to hear the main actor sing was incredible.  I was surprised how good and well written the movie turned out to be.  Buying this for a Lila Downs fan.  I know he will enjoy it.,1387411200,2,364,3.9178082191780823
5751942,5,B00CYLRQDW,"I've seldom watched a movie more than once and I have watched this one 5 times already and know I will watch it again. Saw it as part of a local film festival. Besides the music which is excellent, the story is beautiful, the scenes of Mexico are great and there is nothing bad I can say about it. I love this movie and want all my friends to watch it.",1385424000,4,352,3.971830985915493
5751943,5,B00CYLRQDW,"If you don't know the origin of the word Gringo, the story goes like this: a group of Mexicans  south of the Rio Grande heard a song sung by Americans on the northern side of the border that goes like this: ""Green Grow The Lilacs All Covered With Dew"", which the Mexicans shortened to Gringo. This is a film about an American who wanted to play the guitar in a mariachi band and got  his chance in Guadalajara, Mexico, the home of mariachi music.
My cat Monkey is a big fan of Mexican music and will sit on my lap for hours listening to the music. The film Mariachi Gringo features my favorite Mexico singer from Oaxaca, Lila Downs, whose voice we hear in the film Frida, which tells the story of Frida Kahlo. Lila's mother is a full blooded Mixteca Indian and her father is a professor from the University of Minnesota. She has  released many CDs and DVDs and has given concerts in Spain and France. This film is humorous and has won many awards. Don't miss it.",1384473600,4,962,4.333333333333333
5751944,5,B00CYLRQDW,Funny movie with excellent setting on Guadalajara Jalisco the land of the Tequila and Mariachi. The actors young but very professional. Good drama.,1383436800,,147,5.434782608695652
8587536,4,B00CYLRQDW,"I originally saw this movie a few years ago and it had subtitles for the Spanish speaking parts of the move (which is a lot of the dialog). For some reason, in this version, the subtitles are missing! Not being able to speak Spanish and without the subtitles, a lot of what's happening is lost. Overall a great movie but don't waste your money on this particular version unless you speak Spanish.",1527033600,,396,4.513888888888889
8587537,5,B00CYLRQDW,"Shawn Ashmore can really sing, life doesn't get much better than the world this movie creates. I suppose it could only get better if we threw Aaron Ashmore into the movie as well, but otherwise, I don't know how to improve on this movie, it's perfect, and infinitely better than my pedestrian expectations. Higadera is excellent, she deserves her role in Altered Carbon. They need Shawn in that movie too, though. And Aaron. The dance scene in this movie in a club that turns out to be a gay bar where Shawn gets hit on by a Spanish guy who doesn't speak English, so he dances with him because he can't speak Spanish, is hilarious/adorable and brings back gringo/latino romance memories...the movie even has Lila Downs, my favorite Latin singer, one of my all time favorite singers and I would have chosen her first for this movie myself! What luck! In the same movie as Shawn Ashmore. Singing Shawn Ashmore! With Lila Downs! Enough said. Except that the soundtrack I just listened to today and it was amazing, lots more in there I didn't expect, I'm so glad I bought it.",1519171200,,1071,4.612565445026178
