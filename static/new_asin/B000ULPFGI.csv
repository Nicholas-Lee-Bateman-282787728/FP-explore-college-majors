Just remembering where I was when I first heard all the chart topping songs that were used in the soundtracks for each episode made this a worthwhile buy.

murders variety of different type  of crimes the way it affects the lives of the characters in a dark light or positive light. It is still very affective in its story telling and awesome not to mention is still in mainstrean style

2922439,5,B000ULPFGI,"Michael Mann's 1984 Globe and Emmy winning lightning in a bottle by scored by Jan Hammer featuring pastel wearing Floridian cowboy Don Johnson a.k.a. Sony Crockett and his reluctant NYC transplant Philip Michael Thomas a.k.a. Rico Tubbs. The pair of super cool super vice-cops are lead by a steely enigmatic captain
played by the great Edward James Olmos.
Miami Vice is where the Phil Collins (and other great 80's selections) montage is as much a character as Florida itself. Seriously, Miami Vice was one of the 1st American network-tv show broadcast in stereophonic sound.
Running 5 years and living on thru syndication and a feature film 2006 reboot (not including the original cast members).
It was a super-stylized cop show that perhaps influenced the MTV music video movement as much as it was influenced by it. Not to mention fashion  influences, Hell, I can remember the exact point that I stopped wearing socks with my sneakers!
The genre is sometimes referred to as Neo-noir, the best episodes, in my humble opinion, were the series signature darker ones totally free of stereotypical cop epilogue ending abruptly after some tragic violence and no denouement. Cut to Crockett and/or Tubbs yelling ""no!"" In slow motion, freeze-frame, fade-to-black...

The movie length pilot episode(s) is an impressive intro to the Miami Vice universes, season two's opener the movie length Prodigal Son is equally well executed and opened the door for a full album soundtrack release.

Lots of amazing guest stars, Musicians trying they hand at acting and future celebs: Liam Neeson, Steve Buscemi Viggo Mortenson, Michael Chikis, Bill Paxton,
Glenn Frey, Sheena Easton, Pam Grier, the late Dennis Farina, Helena Bonham Carter, Miguel Ferrer, Iman, Ted Nugent, Ian McShane, Ving Rhames, Mr James Brown, Bruce Willis, Wesley Snipes, Little Richard,  John Glover even ex-Mrs Johnson Melanie Griffith.
Recurring gangster Calderone's avenging son is even John Leguizamo.

Cast regulars include: Saundra Santiago
Michael Talbott
John Diehl
Olivia Brown

2922442,5,B000ULPFGI,I bought this as a gift and it came promptly in time. It is the best series and would recommend this to all Miami Vice enthusiasts.,1394928000,,131,4.076923076923077
2922443,5,B000ULPFGI,Miami Vice was a fantastic show back in the 1980's. Crockett and Tubbs were always great together and they always got the bad guys. Jan Hammer provided the theme song for the show which was awesome. My favorite episodes were the ones with Sheena Easton in them.,1388448000,,261,4.574468085106383
2922444,5,B000ULPFGI,Gave this to my husband last year for Christmas and we have watched it over and over.  It is a great series.,1386028800,,108,3.909090909090909
2922445,5,B000ULPFGI,"I loved Miami Vice and although I'm a woman, try to dress like Don Johnson on the series, rolled-up sleeves on the jackets and tees of various colors, and deck shoes.  The series lasted five seasons and I really enjoyed it and watch it.",1385683200,,236,4.363636363636363
2922446,5,B000ULPFGI,"Well put together. Visual presentation of the packaging is perfect, each season is wrapped in a protective sleeve, and inside is the 3 section tri-folder with 4-5 DVD's inside.  Those are silver with blue and flamingo pink print.  The actual DVD's are the whole show without the advertisements.  I'm in Vice Heaven again.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE DVD's as a bundle, or individual. ..",1381708800,,384,4.953125
2922447,5,B000ULPFGI,"If you're looking for Miami Vice on DVD you have probably heard about the problems with the double sided discs, known as ""flipper discs.""  These discs sometimes don't play in certain DVD players and came in the individual seasons sold by Universal.  After taking some heat over this, Universal went back and reissued a complete series box set of single-sided discs in the white alligator box costing quite a bit more than the individual season sets.

So, you don't want flipper discs but don't want to spend $200 for the alligator box?  Get this set.  These are the single sided discs (all 27 of them) minus the white alligator box for a more affordable price.  If you just want DVDs that work, minus the frilly white box, get this set.",1379376000,10,736,4.623076923076923

2922451,3,B000ULPFGI,"The product is packaged in a brown cardboard box, containing the original white Vice factory box containing the 5 cardboard printed packages containing the dvd discs. The first white Vice box I received was factory damaged, badly dented on a corner.and torn along an edge. Upon opening the white factory Vice box and each of the 5 cardboard dvd holders, most of the the discs were not in their glassine protective sleeves which were themselves squished into the bottom of the slots, dvds were not in their slots period, and the dvds were jostled about ending up sticking to the cardboard liner or had glue balls directly on the playing side of the discs. The white factory Vice box in the replacement received was thankfully not factory damaged. MOST of the discs were in their glassine sleeves, though some discs still weren't with sleeves squished or split and useless, and therefore dvds were sticking to the cardboard liner, but no glue balls. It appears the factory has quality control issues. Unknown if the available separately ordered cardboard dvd packages, and for 1/2 the price as in the boxed set but you don't get the white box (worth $100?), has the same problems.",1370563200,2,1178,4.836633663366337

2922454,5,B000ULPFGI,"I like Miami Vice from the TV. Miami Vice was one reason why was under normal circumstances the constitution was changend in the USA. When anybody else has interest,
to know why, look on a very famous video-portal. You can search the Video with the key-
words ""Iraq war Bush Halberstadt"".",1363305600,,288,4.666666666666667
2922455,5,B000ULPFGI,"First off I have had this set for a little over a year, but I did order it from Amazon and as I remember it did come in a good time and was definately in good condition. The only problem was the Season Three set had a broken holder in the case. (I don't know what you really call it, its the little 'toothed' thing that the DVD disc rests on.) The disc itself was fine, and I just keep it in a DVD envelope inside the Season Three case. All of the discs were in good condition and they all played fine. The only other small complaint I have is that in Season One, sometimes the picture wavers just a little, its not bad enough to hurt the viewing for me, it just kind of looks like the picture is underwater for just a second or two. And the overall quality of the tranfer of Seasons One and Two is not as high as the later seasons...such as spots over the picture or scratches on the picture. In other words, sometimes Season One and Season Two looks twenty some years old.

The white case that the dics come in is really sturdy and has a nice velvetlike or suedelike turquiose colored lining. And if you know ""Miami Vice"" you will understand why the case is done in an alligator skin pattern. If you don't, you will find out when you watch the show.

Any how, I used to watch ""Miami Vice"" back in the day, but I can't say I was a huge fan and did not watch it much in the last two seasons. But about a year ago, I was listening to '80's music on the radio and got to thinking about the show. So when I found the complete series on Amazon I had to have it. I was glad I did buy the whole series, because for all these years I thought the main characters were killed in the series finale.

I have really enjoyed watching ""Miami Vice"" again. I have a Blu-Ray player and although these dics are not Blu-Ray, my player upgrades them and they look great. All the pastel colors of the earlier seasons and the lovely beach scenery just pops! And as far I can remember all of the original songs are there. This was the show of the  '8o's.

So for anyone who is having a mid-life crisis (LOL) like me or who just wants to get a taste of the fashions and music of that time then I highly recommend you get ""Miami Vice"" and watch it.",1359849600,,2223,4.066210045662101

2922458,4,B000ULPFGI,Great set...must have for Vice fans. My only complaint...probably for most others as well is the cheap two sided disc but that's the way it is. Other than that it's a awesome 5 season collection.,1357430400,,195,4.6

2922460,4,B000ULPFGI,"Let's assume you are already familiar with Miami Vice, so let's talk product quality. The complete Miami Vice series is enjoyable to watch even if the dvd quality is not quite as good as it should be. Don't get me wrong, the occasional graininess of the video is slightly disappointing, but in no way a deal breaker. Despite the series having been produced 20 years after Wild, Wild, West and Mission Impossible, the video quality simply is not as good. Regardless, you will not notice the issue most of the time. Lastly, the box set is well built and a nice touch.",1340928000,,565,4.549019607843137

All 5 seasons are in this boxed set and I found the price to be a decent one compared to other sellers.  The box is made to resemble alligator skin and is white.  If you remember, Crockett had a pet alligator named Elvis on his boat.

The quality of the discs has been okay if a bit grainy but that hasn't been a big issue with me. My biggest beef is that one of the discs (Season 2, disc 4, episode 14) had several ""bad spots"" in it and froze up on me.  I had to fast forward through those places, which was annoying.

All in all, so far, I've been happy with the set and hearing some of the sound tracks, reliving the episodes, etc has been worth a few ""bad spots.""  For that reason I could not give this a 5 star.",1304553600,,825,3.869047619047619

2922483,5,B000ULPFGI,"I haven't watched this show since it was on in the 80's and rewatching it after more than 20 years has been so enjoyable. This show was so well made, film, camera work, acting of the leads. Some of the stand alone episodes weren't that great but this is always the case of any long running show. Don Johnson was brilliant as Sonny Crockett and I always enjoyed Phillip Michael Thomas as Ricardo Tubbs. The two actors played so well together.
There are suggestions that Don Johnson was a prima donna but when you watch this show, you do realise that he was the perfect actor for the role and simply did push the quality of the show up. I love Edward James Olmos as Castillo. He and Don Johnson played really well off of each other.

This show defined what was happening at the time and was very reflective of the indulgent mentality of the 80's and it has been an absolute pleasure watching it again. This is a show that truly does stand the test of time. Watch this and, excepting the development in film technology now, I think you would be hard pressed to name 6 shows today that could match up to the quality of work that was ""Miami Vice"".",1281225600,,1142,4.336448598130841

Even more frustrating is that you can only skip to one or two scenes for each episode, which can be pretty inconvenient. On the other hand, I love the fact that you can switch on the subtitles. Since the show was made in the 80's, you can't always hear what they're saying, but the captioning usually clears it right up.

2922494,4,B000ULPFGI,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this one, it definately was ahead of its time in its approach to being a cop show, airing back to back with the No. 1 show at the time ""Dallas"", this one like that one gave people a reason to stay home on Friday nights, & really played on the popularity of MTV at the time with its flashy music videos & style..

Season 1>> This was very groundbreaking for its time as Ricardo Tubbs(Phillip Michael Thomas) tracks a dangerous drug lord from NY to Miami & is unwillingly partnered with Sonny Crockett(Don Johnson) & is determined to bring drug lord Calderone to justice in the pilot epidode, Jimmy Smits(NYPD Blue) makes a cameo appearance as Crockett's doomed partner, the episodes that followed featured many then unknown stars such as Ed O'Neil(Al Bundy) & a pre-""Moonlighting"" Bruce Willis, Edward James Olmos also comes in midway as Lt. Castillo who oversees the vice division of Miami & is very professional in his approach to things, however this season has a few duds toward the end, but the final episode of Season 1 has Crockett & Tubbs protecting a mobster (Dennis Farina, echoeing the character he would play in ""Midnight Run"" a few years later) who will testify in a drug case before going into the witness protection program, after several attempts are made on his life, he then decides not to give up those trying to kill him.

Season 2>>> By far the best Season, the two-parter ""Prodical Son"" definately reeks of the 80's excess, but story wise, this one has Tubbs returning to NY to help an old friend Pam Grier (Jackie Brown) with a case, with Crockett tagging along, there are shootouts, double-crosses, & Julian Beck(Poltergeist) as a bank CEO whose speech is just as true today as it was then (1985) when he tells Crockett & Tubbs that the drug underworld is a big financial boat for many like him & they are just along for the ride, & ""why rock it"", the episodes that follow are quite good, two of my favorites is ""Definately Miami"" as many fans have stated, this is probably the best episode ever as Crockett is smitten with a woman who has a dangeorus agenda that involves rock legend Ted Nugent in a memorable role, won't spoil it here, & ""Little girl lost"" that has Tubbs trying to help a streetwalker get off the streets, a prelude to ""Pretty Woman"" which had better results years later.

Season 3 >>> This one definately took a different approach to the style of the show, as the season bagan, the second half of the 80's(1986-87) were taking shape & MTV & fashion was changing & so this show bagan to change with it, many great guest stars appeared here such as Willie Nelson as a former Texas Ranger who is out to avenge his nephew's murder who was undercover in Miami & soon crosses paths with Crockett & Tubbs, also appearing in one episode at once is Melanie Griffith(Johnson's then-wife), George Takei(""Star Trek's"" Sulu), wrestler Lou Albino, & pop singer Vanity, we also lose a main character this season as well.

Season 4>>> considered by many to be the downfall of the show, this one had some good ones, the opener is good with Stanly Tucci(Devil wears Prada) as a drug lord on trial who mocks the justice system & everyone else involved, he of course gets out of his predicament when the star witness is killed, but gets his later on in the season, the episodes that followed had some memorable guest stars such as Paul Gulliyole, (the humorous lead detective on ""C.S.I.) who may have produced a snuff film, that also has Kelly Lynch(RoadHouse) who may or may not have been his victim, we are never really sure, it never becomes clear, we are also later introduced to singer Sheena Easton who I thought did o.k. as a love interest to Crockett, & Guy Boyd(Body Double) as a freed death row inmate who it turns out was guilty & is wasted by Crockett after he kills Easton, in which in a chain of events loses his memory which set up the season cliffhanger(Vice's first & last) yeah, some episodes are duds, like the UFO one, which is entertaining, just pooly concieved at best, because it makes no sense at all, but overall not a bad season

Season 5>>> Aside from resuming the cliffhanger at the end of Season 4, this season loses its punch fast after all is resolved from Season 4's cliffhanger story arc, A not-yet-famous Julia Roberts makes an appearance here, it was clear that by the 1988-1989 season that this show no longer had its staying power, everything that helpled this show's success was gone, MTV flasy era was changing, the drug wars were no longer making headlines as much, T.V. itself was changing & ""Vice"" it seemed had nothing to really play on as it did in the beginning, by far the weakest season, but worth owning for Sesaon 4's resolution ending.",1266105600,6,4759,4.580985915492958
2922495,4,B000ULPFGI,"Miami Vice came on when I was 13 and I was hooked.  It became a regular Friday night routine to sit in front of the tv to see this show.  It has always been among my favorites from that era along with the Equalizer, Magnum, P.I., and Simon & Simon.

I have to admit I didn't get to see much of the fifth season when it was aired, though I did see the final 2-hour series finale movie.  This box set gave me the opportunity to finally see what I missed 20 years ago.

One of the best things about the box set is that by following the show from season 1 through season 5, you can more readily recall characters that are referred to from previous seasons, or who show up in later seasons from earlier ones.  Another neat thing is seeing the same actors play different characters who all still end up getting whacked.  Also, seeing big name stars before thy became big, and offbeat guest stars make the show quite interesting, too.  I also like seeing episodes again that I remember and never saw again from when they were aired. Seeing the fashions that seemed so commonplace then, in a new light 20 years later, is good for a laugh as well as making one react with ""What were we thinking?""

This box set renewed my interest in Miami Vice again, whereas the movie was a disappointment to me.  I highly recommend this box set to anyone who wants to relive the glory days of the 80s, who remember the show, or equally, to anyone who wants to get acquainted with the series.",1262476800,37,1468,4.286231884057971
2922496,5,B000ULPFGI,"Miami Vice was my absolute favorite cop show, in the '80's and even now...No one else quite represented those wonderfully decadent '80's like a tanned Don Johnson, with that sexy smile, in a pink linen sports coat and Ray-Bans!  I hesitated spending the money on this, but I realized that this Miami Vice Complete Series wouldn't be around forever, given that this show is already approx. 25 years old.  And if I waited, I might end up paying a lot more, later.

I was concerned, howeveer, when I read one of the comments here,  saying that when they got their order, one of the CD's were missing.

However, I'm a fan of all episodes and recommend this to any hardcore Vice fan.  For the casual fan, I would recommend this also, although fairweather Vice fans would probably just benefit from buying individual seasons.  They are all great, though.

It would be great if there were some commentaries from Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas (or anyone), but there are some special features on the Season 1 DVD.  There is a great number of featurettes on it, however.

2922500,2,B000ULPFGI,"This police drama's Complete Series DVD must be just another gimmick that Universal is trying to sell since Universal seems to be on a complete series DVD box set frenzy lately with a lot of Universal distributed shows including KNIGHT RIDER, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, yet I can't see why Universal feels a need to make a complete series DVD of MIAMI VICE either in todays struggling economy.

Perhaps Universal made and released this MIAMI VICE Complete Series DVD to compensate for the flaws and discrepancies that were made on the first  few seasons of the MIAMI VICE DVD's that were released individually on the double sided discs, especially since there were plenty of episodes on the MIAMI VICE-SEASON 1 DVD and MIAMI VICE-SEASON 2 DVD that froze and skipped a lot, which is the same problem I get on the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2 DVD and THE A-TEAM-SEASON 2 DVD, which is probably another reason why Universal decided to make the KNIGHT RIDER-THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD that was released in October of 2008 when THE INCREDIBLE HULK-THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD was released, which is probably why Universal decided to revise them by putting all the episodes on 1-sided disc instead of 2-sided discs.

So I don't see how or why Universal is expected to make a lot of sales with this complete series DVD box set of MIAMI VICE, or even with the KNIGHT RIDER-THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD box set or THE INCREDIBLE HULK-THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD box set, especially during the recession were still stuck in right now.

On the other hand this takes me all the way back to memory lane when MIAMI VICE was on NBC every Friday night at 10PM after HUNTER was shown at 9PM back in the Fall of 1984 thru the Summer of 1985 and when MIAMI VICE was shown at 10PM following KNIGHT RIDER at 9PM on Friday nights at one time in the early Spring of 1986 just before NBC had cancelled KNIGHT RIDER, which pretty much made Don Johnson(Crockett) and David Hasselhoff(Michael) the best looking men on Friday nights, which were both by the way sex symbols at the time, which by the way reminds me that Don Johnson had auditioned for the role of Michael Knight on KNIGHT RIDER back in the Spring of 1982 along with the list of a few other candidates, but Johnson got rejected since the role was given to David Hasselhoff, which therefore made Hasselhoff a star before Johnson was since Johnson didn't become famous until he got the role of Sonny Crockett on MIAMI VICE, which made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1984 when KNIGHT RIDER kicked off its 3rd Season, but I sometimes can't help thinking that Don Johnson probably would have made a terrific Michael Knight, despite the fact that I think David Hasselhoff was more compatible for the Michael Knight role than Johnson was, but I'm sure its partly due to the fact that I've always preferred Hasselhoff to Johnson in general since I always thought David Hasselhoff was better looking anyway just like various other people did.

However my wife always thought Don Johnson was a hottie as well as David Hasselhoff.

By the way, MIAMI VICE was also the show that killed MATT HOUSTON and led to MATT HOUSTON's cancellation on ABC since MIAMI VICE K.O.'d MATT HOUSTON in the ratings when MIAMI VICE made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1984 since MIAMI VICE was shown at the same time-slot as MATT HOUSTON was on Friday nights, which obviously conflicted with MATT HOUSTON's 10PM time slot on ABC since MATT HOUSTON started losing a lot of viewers through MIAMI VICE causing a tidal wave to strike in the ratings for MATT HOUSTON since MATT HOUSTON was outclassed by MIAMI VICE especially since the ratings on MIAMI VICE were soaring at an all-time high while the ratings on MATT HOUSTON were sinking to an all-time low which contributed to ABC cancelling MATT HOUSTON in the Summer of 1985 while MIAMI VICE's 2nd Season was underway on NBC for the Fall of 1985.

Something else I found intriguing about this police drama was at least 4 guys had been considered to audition for the role of Sonny Crockett before it's debut on NBC in September of 1984 and it just so happens that Mark Harmon who co-starred on both ST. ELSEWHERE and CHICAGO HOPE was considered for the role and that Larry Wilcox who played California Highway Patrol Officer Jon Baker on CHiPs had also been considered to audition for the role of Crockett, but then producers felt that it was a lame idea to hire Wilcox for the part since he had previously already portrayed a cop on a series that cancelled only 14 months before MIAMI VICE premiered.

I also used to watch this show in reruns on Cozi-TV, TV Land, TNN, FX, and USA years ago!",1245283200,4,4643,4.605804111245465

Don Johnson as James ""Sonny"" Crockett, Phillip Michael Thomas as Ricardo Tubbs, and Edward James Olmos as the stoic Lt. Martin Castillo, were perfect in their respective roles. If they were one thing; THEY WERE COPS! The rest of the supporting cast fit in well. As well as providing comic relief to the more serious themes of evil, vice, and crime.

Jan Hammer created one of the most recognizable themes in all of Television History as well as composing background music for nearly every episode of it's five year run. (Jan Hammer dropped out of the series towards the end. Tim Truman was chosen by Michael Mann to compose some great music for the final 22 episodes.)

Seasons Four and Five are considered the years that MIAMI VICE ""jumped the shark."" If you're a fan, you know where you stand. I love them all. Even the hilarious THE BIG THAW from Season Four, with it's cryogenically frozen Reggae Star, is TOPS in my book. Fans hate this epsiode. It's one of the episodes I remember vividly from the 80s and it's a scream!

Tight and loose fitting pastel fashions. 80s New Wave, Pop, Top 40, and Reggae provided some of the cinematic background Music Video sequences for a brand new MTV Generation. Fast exotic cars, like Ferraris and Lamborghinis. They too, were characters in the show. Fast exotic car chases. Wealthy well-dressed eccentric cocaine and heroin dealers. The Miami Club Scene. Beautiful modern luxury dream homes. Fast Cigarette boats and luxury yachts. Brutal and blazing police shootouts. Cultures as diverse as Haitian, Columbian, Cuban, Asian, and Jamaican. An all inclusive cast of characters and a rich story history from the Vietnam War to the Golden Triangle. The DEA and ATF to the CIA and KGB Coldwar. From third world Afro-Caribbean Voodoo and Santeria to Japanese Bushido philosophy, this show was about the hippest thing happening in commercial Pop Culture entertainment at the time. Once the show caught on and took off, it was the first time people actually stayed home on Friday nights to watch television. My girlfriend and I were big club goers in the 80s. We stayed home quite a bit to watch it. Nothing would ever be the same in the visual medium of Television and Cinema. VICE was a TRENDSETTER.

Some of the cameos and performers include: Frank Zappa, Glenn Frey, Gene Simmons, Ted Nugent, Phil Collins, Bruce Willis, Bianca Jagger, Pam Grier, Ving Rhames, John Leguizamo, Dennis Farina, Ben Stiller, Alfred Molina, Liam Neeson, (rightwing wacko) G. Gordon Liddy, Lawrence Fishburne, Bill Paxton, Wesley Snipes, Miles Davis, Willie Nelson, Steve Buscemi, Helena Bonham Carter, Brad Dourif, Viggo Mortensen, Annette Bening, Melanie Griffith, George Takei, Ian McShane, Benicio Deltoro, Chris Rock, (Sonny's wife in later epsiodes) Sheena Easton, R. Lee Ermey, and Julia Roberts.

On to the product.

Ever wondered what happened to Sonny's pet alligator, Elvis? Individual SEASON BOX SETS are contained in a large imitation white alligator skin box with an imitation satin lining which looks hot on the shelf.

Fans that bought the individual SEASON BOX SETS complained about the double-sided DVDs being cheap, defective, or not playing correctly. Universal has always been a cheap bottom-line company. I feel your pain. Maybe Universal heard these complaints. Because THE COMPLETE SERIES episodes are on ONE-SIDED DVDs in the individual SEASON BOX SETS, and I haven't noticed any defects. I waited. Sometimes it pays to be patient.

Fans also complained about the epsiodes not being cleaned up. TRUE. They look as if they have been transferred directly from the original broadcast tapes complete with grain and scratches in some cases. You won't notice a lot of scratches, but you will notice some grain, especially in the night sequences and in the earlier epsiodes. The later espisodes are much better quality, probably because they were spending more money on the show (it shows) and taking better care of the tapes for syndication purposes when they knew they had a Hit Show. Still, the majority of the epsiodes look pretty good. Just pretend you're watching this series like you were in the 80s and it's almost unnoticeable. Younger audiences should act accordingly. (Younger audiences should also remember this series is not as realistic as the Cop Shows of today. MIAMI VICE was more like a cultural hyperrealism. Some of you will not buy into it. Again, in the 80s it was SEMINAL TV.) FOUR STARS for the Visuals.

The 80s TV sound has been remixed into Dolby 5.1. The volume is far too low and you won't hear anything coming out of your rear effects speakers. I wish they would have done it in 2.1 stereo so I could use my Prologic and get some sound out of my rear speakers. If you view the episodes from your TV speakers, you'll have to turn it up about 8 tenths to get a good volume. THREE 1/2 STARS for Sound.

The are only a few EXTRAS on the FIRST DISC of THE FIRST SEASON. A couple of documentaries on the fashion, sound, visuals, and impact of VICE. That's all. The show pretty much speaks for itself. Individual DISCS from SEASONS ONE and TWO contain a written synopsis of the individual episodes and a list of cameos when you click on them in the EPISODE MENU. They disappear after SEASON TWO and you must look to the SEASON BOX covers for a synopsis of each episode (sans a list of cameos.) ONE 1/2 STARS for the Extras.

Overall this BOX SET gets FOUR 1/2 STARS because the Series was the first of it's kind. And, the great sentimental value this holds for me personally.

If you're thinking about buying at least the first THREE SEASONS, stay away from the individual BOX SETS and buy THE COMPLETE SERIES. SEASONS FOUR and FIVE contain some great episodes and you'll get the 2 Hour Series Finale, FREEFALL. If you bought some of the individual SEASON BOX SETS, and think this SET is different, it's not. Aside from the single-sided DVDs, which may or may not persuade you to sell them off, you don't need to buy THE COMPLETE SERIES. Patient or wary fans will definitely want to purchase THE COMPLETE SERIES.

THIS WAS A MONUMENTAL TV SERIES. Warts and all!
