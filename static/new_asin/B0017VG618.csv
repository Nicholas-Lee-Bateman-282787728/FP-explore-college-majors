3175990,4,B0017VG618,"I saw the last two segments on HDTV, buying the DVD.  What I got from these two episodes was much more than the technical flaws mentioned by BBP.  I liked how they showed the graphic images of the brain and what is going on in the brain while the action is taking place or has taken place, which connected behaviors and injury with the brain, very important.  The best part was when they showed the segment on sight and how the brain reacts to a flood of information (we are not as unperceptive as one might think), great work there.  It made me aware of a broader problem with people who are on starvation diets and how that might affect those around us, it also changed my thinking about lower calorie (1200-1600 kcal) diets and aging, though I would have liked more detail about the reasoning behind this, some of which I already know.

While BBP was apparently focused on the technical flaws it seems he missed what was intended.  I think it's worth the money if you have little knowledge about human physiology and are a younger audience not wishing to see a lot of gore.  Several viewings and your brain and mind will get the messages.  If you are looking for something more technical with more gross anatomy, then this is not for you and I agree National Geographic's 1975 film on the Human Body may be more to your liking.  I do have that one and despite all the gore I have seen on television it still unnerves me to view this one.  The brain has been trained to look outside the human body for millenia and looking into it, if you are not a Doctor, takes some time to adjust to but is worth the effort.",1293580800,,1612,4.343333333333334
3175991,5,B0017VG618,The DVD is excellent interpretation of human body senses. How the human body cope up the harsh conditions is presented in a very good form with 3D models.

3175993,2,B0017VG618,I have watched this series but not purchased it. I just had to say that the educational censorship in the sensation episode is disappointing.

They watched the first half which is the part on sight yesterday.  Both enjoyed it immensely.  The older sister had video watching fatique (not sure of the exact time but the segments are lengthy) but the younger one wanted to continue watching as she was absolutely fascinated by the content of these videos.  Anything this educational that holds both their attentions is a winner in this home schooling household!",1256083200,,576,4.72
3175999,2,B0017VG618,"The ""Human Body"" comes to us as four 40-minute episodes (Sight, Strength, Sensation, Brain Power) on 2 Blu-ray discs, housed in a standard-sized case. Each episode contains personal accounts of extraordinary survival tales, re-enactments by actors, and computer animations. The back of the box touts itself as a ""groundbreaking program"" with ""stunning CGI"", but the production is anything but innovative. The main problem is that it tries to look like an action movie instead of a science show. In an attempt to appeal to more casual audiences, Discovery has skipped over a lot of the science and medical presentation in favor of computer graphics and trendy camera tricks. It's heavy on stylization and light on the science, using a lot of fast cuts, cliche editing techniques, and repetitive CGI. For example, the first episode (""Sight"") begins with a re-enactment of a high speed police car chase through crowded city streets, with overused Terminator-like cross-hair targeting motion graphics and accompanying sci-fi sound effects.

All the episodes are plagued with uneven editing that makes the series look at times like a music video or an extended car commercial. A typical example of the overused, spasmodic, and cliche editing is the stop and go motion of many shots: shots will start off in slow motion, then suddenly sped up, then slowed again, sometimes rapidly intercut with a series of other shots. This is what a science show might look like if Michael Bay directed it. While people with attention deficit disorder may find this acceptable, my patience quickly wore thin.

Secondly is the frequent, overused, and repetitive CG. You'll be seeing the same animations over and over again, several times within the same episode. Among them are 3-D rotations of a transparent human body, the skull and parts of the brain, or signals traveling through a web of nerve fibers (think Spider-Man opening credits), etc. These are shown again and again in every episode. Surprisingly, there are very few shots of actual cells or tissue under magnification. I counted less than 5 shots of actual photos from scanning electron microscopes (bone structure, muscle fiber), with no x-rays, MRI's or other medical imaging that I can remember.

The main problem is this series was designed for commercial television, not home video. Each episode is built around six self-contained 7-minute segments, with a commercial break in between. Much of the same animation is repeated in each of these segments as a reminder of what happened before the break. For Blu-ray viewers watching with the commercial breaks removed, the disruption in continuity is jarring and abrupt.

Another poor choice is the deliberate cinma vrit feel of all the personal interviews. For every single one of these shots, the camera has that wobbly hand-held look, usually accompanied a mandatory zoom in on the speaker (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NYPD-Blue/dp/B00144K5LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NYPD Blue</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>). Content-wise, I found these to be the most interesting part of the series. In particular, I wanted to hear more about the man who survived for 30+ days at sea, the woman who fell off the side of a mountain and crawled 2 days to safety with a fractured hip and leg bones, or the French hiker who was trapped inside a cave for over a month with no food. Sadly, the interviews with experts and accounts from survivors are short. I'd much rather hear a survivor's first-hand account of his/her ordeal or a medical experts explanation than watch a dramatized recreation or another recycled animation.

Lastly, the show is not helped by Bray Poor's over-dramatized narration. His speaking style is unnatural and his intonation makes him sound like he's voicing over a movie trailer.

To sum up, this is ""science lite"". Watch it on Discovery if it comes on the air again, but give this BD a miss. It's not worth owning. The poor production choices distract from the presentation of facts and there is nothing innovative about superimposing 3D animations over live shots.

3410487,4,B0017VG618,"I saw the last two segments on HDTV, buying the DVD.  What I got from these two episodes was much more than the technical flaws mentioned by BBP.  I liked how they showed the graphic images of the brain and what is going on in the brain while the action is taking place or has taken place, which connected behaviors and injury with the brain, very important.  The best part was when they showed the segment on sight and how the brain reacts to a flood of information (we are not as unperceptive as one might think), great work there.  It made me aware of a broader problem with people who are on starvation diets and how that might affect those around us, it also changed my thinking about lower calorie (1200-1600 kcal) diets and aging, though I would have liked more detail about the reasoning behind this, some of which I already know.

While BBP was apparently focused on the technical flaws it seems he missed what was intended.  I think it's worth the money if you have little knowledge about human physiology and are a younger audience not wishing to see a lot of gore.  Several viewings and your brain and mind will get the messages.  If you are looking for something more technical with more gross anatomy, then this is not for you and I agree National Geographic's 1975 film on the Human Body may be more to your liking.  I do have that one and despite all the gore I have seen on television it still unnerves me to view this one.  The brain has been trained to look outside the human body for millenia and looking into it, if you are not a Doctor, takes some time to adjust to but is worth the effort.",1293580800,,1612,4.343333333333334

3410496,2,B0017VG618,"The ""Human Body"" comes to us as four 40-minute episodes (Sight, Strength, Sensation, Brain Power) on 2 Blu-ray discs, housed in a standard-sized case. Each episode contains personal accounts of extraordinary survival tales, re-enactments by actors, and computer animations. The back of the box touts itself as a ""groundbreaking program"" with ""stunning CGI"", but the production is anything but innovative. The main problem is that it tries to look like an action movie instead of a science show. In an attempt to appeal to more casual audiences, Discovery has skipped over a lot of the science and medical presentation in favor of computer graphics and trendy camera tricks. It's heavy on stylization and light on the science, using a lot of fast cuts, cliche editing techniques, and repetitive CGI. For example, the first episode (""Sight"") begins with a re-enactment of a high speed police car chase through crowded city streets, with overused Terminator-like cross-hair targeting motion graphics and accompanying sci-fi sound effects.

All the episodes are plagued with uneven editing that makes the series look at times like a music video or an extended car commercial. A typical example of the overused, spasmodic, and cliche editing is the stop and go motion of many shots: shots will start off in slow motion, then suddenly sped up, then slowed again, sometimes rapidly intercut with a series of other shots. This is what a science show might look like if Michael Bay directed it. While people with attention deficit disorder may find this acceptable, my patience quickly wore thin.

Secondly is the frequent, overused, and repetitive CG. You'll be seeing the same animations over and over again, several times within the same episode. Among them are 3-D rotations of a transparent human body, the skull and parts of the brain, or signals traveling through a web of nerve fibers (think Spider-Man opening credits), etc. These are shown again and again in every episode. Surprisingly, there are very few shots of actual cells or tissue under magnification. I counted less than 5 shots of actual photos from scanning electron microscopes (bone structure, muscle fiber), with no x-rays, MRI's or other medical imaging that I can remember.

The main problem is this series was designed for commercial television, not home video. Each episode is built around six self-contained 7-minute segments, with a commercial break in between. Much of the same animation is repeated in each of these segments as a reminder of what happened before the break. For Blu-ray viewers watching with the commercial breaks removed, the disruption in continuity is jarring and abrupt.

Another poor choice is the deliberate cinma vrit feel of all the personal interviews. For every single one of these shots, the camera has that wobbly hand-held look, usually accompanied a mandatory zoom in on the speaker (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NYPD-Blue/dp/B00144K5LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NYPD Blue</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>). Content-wise, I found these to be the most interesting part of the series. In particular, I wanted to hear more about the man who survived for 30+ days at sea, the woman who fell off the side of a mountain and crawled 2 days to safety with a fractured hip and leg bones, or the French hiker who was trapped inside a cave for over a month with no food. Sadly, the interviews with experts and accounts from survivors are short. I'd much rather hear a survivor's first-hand account of his/her ordeal or a medical experts explanation than watch a dramatized recreation or another recycled animation.

Lastly, the show is not helped by Bray Poor's over-dramatized narration. His speaking style is unnatural and his intonation makes him sound like he's voicing over a movie trailer.

To sum up, this is ""science lite"". Watch it on Discovery if it comes on the air again, but give this BD a miss. It's not worth owning. The poor production choices distract from the presentation of facts and there is nothing innovative about superimposing 3D animations over live shots.
