8605917,3,B00EJ4OJEG,"1000 ways to die is a TV show that was shown on SPIKE TV a few years back. Each episode re-enacts a bizarre way people have died... well, supposedly. The viewer discretion does say it's based on a real event, underline and bold the word ""based"" because there is some stories told/shown that are impossible to know they actually happened the way shown. The stories are obviously beefed up to be more entertaining, and it is, but suspend a bit of reality if you wanna enjoy this show, otherwise you might end up like my wife who hates the show because she claims the stories are all made up. She might be right on alot of them, but then again, I think she just hates the gory images.

Like I said, the show is beefed up and the writers, producers etc have added alot of fictional elements to the stories to make them more entertaining. They do this with quite a lot of B.S and a lot of babes. There is barely an unattractive woman in the entire series! It's amazing how many gorgeous women out there have death chasing after them, either that are the producers are only interested in.... nah, forget it, sex sells, and it's obvious they where desperate to make this show a hit.

Season 1 is an OK buy. Even tho it's actually mostly season 2. They only made two episodes for season 1, so don't worry, you aren't going to have to scream for petitions to get the real season 1 on DVD, it is on this. It's kind of like how Star Wars 1, 2 & 3 are actually 4, 5 & 6 because 4, 5 & 6 are now the original 1, 2 & 3 and then parts 7, 8 & 9 will be parts 10, 11 & 12 to avoid any confusion.

The show pretty much has 4 or 5 or more cases shown. They have a re-enactment, something like on Unsolved Mysteries and shows like that. Then have a fake doctor explain why breaking your neck is a bad thing, possibly followed by a random person, such as a porn star, saying pointless things to go along with the video.

It's all entertainment, and it works, just don't watch it expecting the whole truth like it's a documentary or contains actual footage. Some of the stories facts are debatable if they actually happened, or are just very loosely based on a true story? You should get thought season 1 OK, but after that, a lot of the same story keeps reoccurring. There seems to be a lot of stories about people getting something stuck in their throat that are all probably based on the same story, and shown 4 different ways that I have counted so far. A fish, a cucumber, a harmonica and a billiard/Snooker ball. Still, maybe people have been that unfortunate, or dumb... then again, it might be 100% fictitious nonsense.

There are stories I have seen on this that I know did not happen. One being a woman's breast implants exploded on a plane from the cabin pressure rising... I guess they aired that before Mythbusters debunked it? But like I said, it's just a show made for entertainment. There is boobs, blood, gore and babes, they had a recipe for a winner here.",1398556800,,2952,4.2831541218638
