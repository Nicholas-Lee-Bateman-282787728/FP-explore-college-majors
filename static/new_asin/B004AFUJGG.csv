4308290,5,B004AFUJGG,"In a world where Disney sucks the life and soul out of an avant-guarde, pre-cyberpunk, pre-Ghost in the Shell story in order to monetize it, comes a story of how the Second-Life world of Tron has really evolved and kept pace with the modern Internet, gaming and society.

This is a story of how people's Avatars still play fighting games StreetFighter'ish, share their lives Facebook'ish, and blend the Internet world's reality and fiction on many levels. Yet, it's a world that bears a MCP's power to control lives in reality.

At the same time, it is surprisingly, easily wrapped and connected into a communal, nostalgic, grass-roots, family, day-to-day lives between two maturing Japanese teens and their friends and family.",1295481600,10,727,5.100840336134453
4308291,5,B004AFUJGG,"My Christmas eve 2010 was spent with my extended family but I had the pleasure to spend that Christmas day in a movie theater with the Jinnouchi family. I went to see the movie Summer Wars in San Francisco on that rainy Christmas day and it was well worth the 100 mile drive.

In my humble opinion Summer Wars directed by Hosoda Mamoru is the best animation I've seen in a long time and I just per-ordered this dvd on Amozon.

The heroes of this exciting, hilarious and heartwarming movie are Kenji and the Jinnouchi family.
The best animations have authentic believable characters and here we find several of them most notably Sakae, the family's charismatic matriarch. If there was an Academy award for best supporting actress in an animation it should go to her.  In what could have easily stayed a simple scifi adventure alone, Hosoda has seamlessly weaved in an extensive cast of charming heart and togetherness.

The male lead Kenji is a shy math geek who has never even dated a girl before. He agrees to a summer job escorting Natsuki, the most popular girl in school, to her family's gathering. A sprawling earthy ancient rural family estate where the Jinnouchi clan has gathered to celebrate the family matriarch's 90th birthday. This is the real world setting where the enemy strikes however the movie doesn't just take place in this world. It starts introducing you to the white sterile appealing online universe called OZ that has all but completely taken over all the worlds workings. As in ""the Wizard of OZ"" something there declares it self as ""all powerful"" and starts stealing peoples very identities and online privileges.

Kenji stuck in the middle of nowhere like a fish out of water has to ask for help from the people he just met and instead of saving the day alone, is becomes the catalyst that helps unite the family together in battle.

Yes it gets deadly serious, and just when you think the battle is over the villain strikes back once more and then once again putting you on the edge of your seat.

Not being Japanese, I enjoyed being introduced to things like the ancient card game of Hanafuda Koi Koi and the anime cliche wherein a shy boy gets a nose bleed when kissed by a beautiful girl.

If you liked Mamoru Hosoda's the Girl Who Leapt Through Time (and why shouldn't you) then you'l definitely love this movie.",1293926400,11,2345,4.661016949152542
4308292,5,B004AFUJGG,"If Hayao Miyazaki made a cyberthriller, the result might be something like ""Summer Wars."" This colorful little anime movie spends most of its run straddling the line between a family reunion comedy and a world war entirely on the web. And the results manage to stir your heart and make you laugh at the same time.

Math nerd Kenji is shocked when popular upperclassman Natsuki asks him to come to her family's country house for the weekend. Unfortunately, he's there under false pretenses -- not only is Natsuki claiming that he's her boyfriend, but that he's a wealthy college student at Tokyo U. Yeah, that is inevitably going to backfire.

But something far worse happens when OZ (a crazy hybrid of amazon.com, Facebook, fighting video games and... well, just about everything you can find on the WWW) is hacked -- and Kenji is the main suspect.

The truth is actually much more sinister -- a horrendous program called Love Machine is devouring OZ user avatars, and is using the computer connections to cause chaos all across the world. When tragedy strikes the family, Kenji inspires them to fight back against Love Machine. But can the family's plan stop the program before it has a chance to take revenge on them?

""Summer Wars"" isn't really like any other movie I've ever seen -- it's part cyberthriller, part bittersweet family story, part crazy comedy, and part colorful anime. It starts off as a simple family dramedy, with Kenji getting thrown into Natsuki's eccentric family and dealing with all the baggage they bring with them. Plus, you know he's going to get busted.

But when Love Machine appears, the stakes are suddenly the technological safety of the ENTIRE WORLD. So we get a wild, crazy guerilla cyberwarefare (involving a boat, a giant computer, an army truck and lots of ice!) as the family (plus Kenji) unites to battle Love Machine. At the same time, the writer maintains the focus on the eccentric family, their grudges, and their unique personalities.

Plus, the animation for this movie is SPELLBINDING. The ""real world"" stuff is rendered in traditional hand-drawn anime, but the scenes set in OZ are brilliant, surreal, colorful and dreamlike. Whole civilizations on shelves, crowned whales, floating islands, stacked sports stadia, and endless chambers filled with strange little creatures.

And all the characters are very well-fleshed-out. Kenji is a nice, rather socially inept guy with epic math skills, and Natsuki is a strong young girl who finds herself with the weight of the ENTIRE PLANET on her shoulders. The entire cast is well-developed -- from the stately grandmother to the idiot cousin who doesn't know what's going on -- but one of the best is Kazuma, a 13-year-old kung-fu expert/computer nerd.

""Summer Wars"" may start small, but it quickly grows to the epic size of the World Wide Web itself. Even better: it's funny, heartwarming and all-around engrossing.",1293235200,180,2908,4.993801652892562
4308293,5,B004AFUJGG,"Summer Wars is not an Anime movie. Is not a matter of sit in your favorite couch and enjoy something that may make you laugh or cry. It is real and deep poetry that will invade your soul and make you think, feel and question your own life, your own existence and how you relate with your others and in general with the world.

I am not reviewing in fact this release as this is yet a preorder. But I've already watched the movie about four times and every time I watch it, I love it more and more. Also, I don't want to give you spoilers as that are annoying and the magic of this movie resides basically on its own essence, the surprise factor.

The only I can say is that this movie resembles what Miyazaki San and other great creators always wanted to transmit in their movies / series. That the magic, the love, the fantasy lives in each of us and that greatness can flow out once in a while to give dreams in a cruel and simple world as ours.

Cheers,",1293148800,10,956,4.129032258064516

4308299,2,B004AFUJGG,"I read the reviews and thought this would be good but I honestly didn't find myself getting into this film as much as I would of liked,I just wasn't feeling the story line too much or maybe it was something else... it did have a lot of corny scenes  . Maybe I need to watch it again to get into it . I've had to do that once or twice before with some other films  in the past to really see the true gems they were and maybe that's the case here but that's usually not  that hard  for me because I'm kind of a movie buff and enjoy collecting good films  and adding those to my collection .I'd like to say I've  got a pretty good list of films I could probably name off to Give you a better idea of what I consider good . Maybe the other reviewers raised my expectations on this one not to mention I watched this not long after watching another film called (your name) which WAS A GREAT MOVIE !!! Ah it was so good!!! By far a new favorite of mine . Maybe That film possibly overshadowed  this one leaving me to feel unimpressed :/ I dunno... I really wanted to love or  at least like this film but like I said I did not fall in love the first time I watched this it just felt blah. I'll have to give it another go and come back to this review.  I don't regret the purchase and I think it's worth a watch .",1517270400,,1304,3.9277566539923954

4308322,5,B004AFUJGG,"Loved it.  Slice of life and suspense thriller in one, but I liked it best for the everyday home life of a huge family full of funny and quirky characters.  Love the only slightly futuristic integration of social media and how deeply it is entrenched in daily life and how if something should go wrong with it could cause huge crisis.  Modern day ""War Game"" with rogue AI stealing personal accounts and putting the world at risk unless our main characters can stop it in the cyberspace virtual world where its running amok.",1502323200,,523,4.602150537634409

4308340,5,B004AFUJGG,"Summer Wars is a great movie for those of us who love the Japanese Animation! Honestly, I think I actually watched this movie for 5 nights in row, and 3 of those nights I watched it by myself. The movie has an interesting story about the world all using one very large social game/social space to do everything from schedule doctors appointments, make business deals, or hell, buy a fancy smancy sports car, and what would happen if someone was able to hack into this ""supposedly"" unhackable world!

Personally I enjoyed this movie more than several other big Japanese Animations that came out near its release (Wolf Children, Boy & The Beast, &The Girl Who Leapt Through Time).",1493596800,,678,4.745762711864407

The representation of their Online interface that most of this story takes place is really fascinating and enjoyable. I really like how the plot cares you through the story like a whirlwind while really making you feel like you connected with each of the characters.

I cannot recommend his films enough. If you have not seen this movie you owe it to your self to go watch it.
If I had to say something bad about the movie, I think it would have to be with the animation of people crying. He can make a really emotional moment but when you see the person crying, to me the tears always looked a little weird.

Yes that's right.  The director of that mess of a children's movie also directed this movie......along with several others and who is trying to be the second coming of Hayao Miyazaki cause we REALLY need another Miyazaki ....

But don't worry.  This is a retelling of the Digimon movie done like ten million times better.

A young man named Kenji is dragged away by the girl of his dreams, Natsuki, to be her boyfriend while she visits her large extended family at her grandmother's birthday.  While there Kenji gets an email with a problem that needs solving.....that leads to the almost destruction of the world.....oops.

With so many characters, it doesn't focus on the two leads very well but it's the family that makes this movie shine (especially the grandmother who is the absolute star of this movie)

A computer virus called Love Machine threatens the online world of OZ. OZ has real world businesses and governments in it so if you take over OZ you take over the world and can launch nukes that'll totally ruin your day.

Naming the extended family would take far too long but it's worth noting that the black sheep of the family made Love Machine.

This all-powerful virus is, of course, taken care of.......by a card game.  A card game that isn't explained to us and thus we know little of the rules.  To quote a review on YouTube:  ""That's right, you Koi Koi that MF!  .... I have no idea what's going on""

4308417,4,B004AFUJGG,"Anime has a problem.

What once started out as simply a method of story-telling--a form of expression--for Japan (and other countries) has since become inundated with it's own culture. Anime has started to exist because of anime. It becomes a paradox of cycling logic, where it only acts that way because that is how anime acts.

There are the visionary greats who break away from this. People like Hiyao Miyazaki who use their art to tell stories, and not simply as an excuse to create more anime, but they are few and far between.

So, where does Summer Wars fit into this? It's definitely a product of it's time. It's very Japanese, taking place in the life of a High School kid (anime trope), who participates in a strangely ubiquitous pseudo-digital world (anime trope), when a beautiful girl takes notice of the main character (anime trope), and asks him to do something scandalous (anime trope). All the while something dastardly is afoot in that digital place that involves sweet fight scenes that have really nothing to do with computers, but pretend to (anime trope).

Summer Wars checks all the boxes for the usual.

But, this is where it departs trope-lane and makes for the country.

This is a show about family. Not stereotypical family, but ideal family. It's animation is superb, with a high premium on facial expressions and complex feelings. It begins to be a tribute to noble ideals and Japanese culture, without being a tribute to anime itself.

Yeah, the computer systems leave holes of logic that a baseball stadium could fit into. And, yeah, the animation takes a dive whenever trope-ish emotional-shortcuts are used (bloody-noses for embarrassment and tension, arm-flailing and shouting about life's simple injustices). But, overall, this anime is about real things, and expresses them candidly.

It ain't no masterpiece, but Summer Wars is a good, family-centric film that inspires betterness in those that watch it.

Uplifting and fun.",1469318400,3,1961,5.027777777777778

4308432,5,B004AFUJGG,"Though precisely that problem confronts our protagonists, nor is this a screwball comedy romance though our nerdy everyman of a hero gets conned by the most popular girl in school (whom he has a secret crush on) into pretending to be her fiance at a family gathering (Yeah, THAT'S gonna work!).  Instead this is a movie about families, about what holds them together, about what tears them apart, and in particular families with a tradition of service.  In an English subtitled interview in the Extras section the director seems genuinely puzzled that this movie would strike such a chord with audiences around the world, but while a family that still takes pride in once having been vassals to a shogun era feudal clan might SEEM utterly alien to non-Japanese, it really isn't if you just stop to think about it because we all know (or know of) similar sorts of families in our own countries: cop families, fire fighter families, military families, etc., and members of such families would have no trouble grasping the idea that if one of your own messes up, you have a family obligation to make it right.

Being too nice (or too lovesick) to bail on Natsuki when she reveals her plot, Kenji stays, experiencing the tortures of the damned in fear of his eventual, inevitable exposure and enduring treatment from Natsuki's huge extended family that varies from overwhelming to nerve wracking to downright cruel, but along the way something happens.  As the sole child of an absent, working overseas father and a long hours working mother, he begins to appreciate the benefits of a large family and finds himself wistfully envying what Natsuki has and what he can never have once the family gathering is over and Natsuki wraps up the lie by telling everyone that they've broken up.

Then the long telegraphed disaster strikes, Kenji is exposed and, worse, falsely accused of causing it.  At first it seems to be just a series of nasty computer pranks,... until somebody very close to them dies as a result.  Then while the women of the Jinnouchi clan mobilize to manage the family through the crisis, it falls to the men of the Jinnouchi clan along with Natsuki and Kenji to mobilize and wage and win a cyber war.  As per their history, the odds are hopeless but that never stopped the Jinnouchis before, and it doesn't stop them now.  Does everyone manage to put aside the past and rise to the challenge to save the world?  You might as well ask the outcome of the simultaneously occurring baseball match in which a Jinnouchi family member puts his team on his back and tries to pitch them into the nationals with ups and downs that eerily parallel those of the ongoing cyber war.  It is corny and predictable and absolutely wonderful!

So, any defects?  Only a minor one and that could possibly be a translation error.  It is revealed at the end that the disaster was caused by the US Army that contracted to purchase the Love Machine virus DELIBERATELY releasing it as some sort of test....  Nope.  Sorry.  Never going to happen.  The US Army would never do this; hell, the Japanese army would never do this; nobody in their right mind would ever do this!  An accidental release, as contrarily reported earlier in the film?  Yes, I can see that.  For comparison over the years the US and the Russians have managed to lose at least six nuclear weapons that were never recovered, but all were due to accidents, and while nuclear tests have occasionally gone wrong and resulted in fallout in unexpected places, no one has ever deliberately tested one in range of a populated area in order to see what might happen, and no sane person ever would.

That minor criticism aside this film is highly recommended!

4308440,5,B004AFUJGG,"Starting off, I am a huge Miyazaki fan (as many other anime fans are) and from this movie, have become a believer in Hosoda's work. Many people tend to give a great animated film with killer sound, visuals, and story, a reviewing term I like to call ""Ghibli-ness."" People will never stop marveling in the genius that is Miyazaki, but it is time to allow another genius step into the limelight. This movie has the complete package and left me satisfied in every way from its sensational music, to the unique Hosoda art style and coloring. The images were vivid, the colors were captivating and warm, the cast was phenomenal, and the story was heart warming. A majority of Miyazaki films tend to do quite a bit of ""hand-holding"" as they tell the story and can sometimes leave you with a desire for more after the credits roll. This is still the case is this film as it is targeted to a younger audience, but I found this world to be more realistic. Don't get me wrong, I love stories that take you to a faraway land and spark your imagination, but there is something so beautiful about a modern story.",1462406400,,1099,4.472636815920398

4308443,4,B004AFUJGG,"I used to be big into anime 20 years ago or so when it was fringe, and I had a falling out with the scene ever since adult children with bad taste began dominating the culture favoring a combination of stuff I can't stand and mass produced garbage TV anime (basically, the turn started when DBZ became popular on CN and getting worse and worse with Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach). The other 2 aspects of anime, OVAs and movies, were obscured and pushed into the background.

Likely due to its content, Summer Wars briefly surfaced and had some buzz about it around the time it was new (which is normally bad... we're talking about adult children with bad taste here). Looking at the trailer for the movie, I was intrigued and wanted to see it. My interest was piqued even more when I heard the movie's plot was Digimon: the Movie. I was fully expecting the flick to be a train wreck.

I was likely drunk at the time, but I wound up buying this DVD/BR combo to fulfill my morbid curiosity.

Turns out the movie is watchable and actually not that bad. Even more fascinating is if you didn't know the plot was Digimon: The Movie, you would never know. As a matter of fact, Summer Wars is Disney grade family entertainment; its something that really can appeal to both children and adults. Other than the obvious differences in cultures, Summer Wars is also something that is palatable for Western audiences.

As far as the Digimon: The Movie connection goes, its not what you might think. What Westerners know as a single theatrical release film, existed in Japan as 3 separate short films that were all edited together into 1 movie. While technically Summer Wars truly is a recycling of the Digimon film's story arc, it exists without the circumstance and pressure put on a franchise like Digimon. So there's no shuffling of characters. Its not cloying or sickeningly puerile. And its not so insultingly dumbed down for children. The transition from Digimon to something seemingly new and fresh is well done.

Like I said, Summer Wars is actually pretty good.

Well, with the exception of how they defeat the bad guy. That is pretty absurd. Surprised my eyes didn't fall out of my head from rolling so hard.",1460937600,,2205,4.626598465473146

The big climax was unnecessary.  It could've kept on with the infrastructure collapse instead and been more efficient.  The baseball scenes were grating.  Yes, there is significance in the cyber world, but that doesn't require being juxtaposed with baseball.  I'm getting a little tired of the  US/ US military being the bad guy in animes.  Also, there is no reason the amazon stream can't have the japanese dub with english subtitles.  It was in the info, but still.

I still enjoyed it, but it could've been better.",1460246400,2,534,4.910112359550562

4308446,3,B004AFUJGG,"Beautifully rendered story of a family tearing apart and coming back together as life takes unexpected paths. The computer metaverse fiction falls apart in ways that are all too common for cyberpunk thrillers, but it stands up alright as fuel for the personal drama. Just never let yourself ask: ""What does this represent in computer terms?""

Summer Wars plays some interesting lip service to reversing sexist tropes throughout the film, but it generally subscribes to antiquated norms of men's and women's roles. This was made more frustrating by characters specifically stating that women hold the power in the family, then that just not really being in evidence by the actions of the characters.",1459209600,2,698,5.176991150442478

It's goofy, but has a lot of heart and does a good job with both it's a plot and b plot (A family reunion, and a virus taking most of the internet hostage). The animation is stellar, and really helps differentiate between the two plots. The voice acting is fabulous, and, really, get this, if you have the opportunity, you most likely will not regret it.",1458950400,,422,4.2875

Tip: Make sure your kids are mature enough to handle certain topics. The family makes references to family member theft and talks about exile, some uncle's briefly mention the two college kids getting knocked up, and there is a realistic death scene.",1458345600,,502,4.91764705882353

4308467,3,B004AFUJGG,"Um... So according to other reviewers, I'm the odd man out here... but I'm not sure why this gets so much love. I'm not an avid anime watcher (I even say ""anime"" like an American would though I've been corrected by purists often), but I do love particular shows like Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online and ~almost~ all the Studio Ghibli films. I guess I'm just pickier than others. This one felt a bit more Saturday morning-ish to me than Wolf Children did, which is much more my style of show, I guess.

I'll agree with many others, the family dynamic was good. I won't say ""great"" as I never felt attached to any of them by the end in comparison to some other movies. It was fun to see them all act like a crazy dis/functional family, but I never felt like I was a part of it... nor did I feel like our protagonist did either, though they tried to portray it. I would have liked to see more between him and the main lead female, but I never got a satisfied feeling in that realm, either.

However, I wish more of the story stayed with the family versus the online world they all interacted with. I just can't see why an entire real-world would sign into a weird avatar-led community for every single need, like banking, business meetings, online dating and general online web-browsing. It was a bit too much of a reach for me and I had trouble connecting to the story for that... along with the fact that a computer virus would take on the role of an avatar and actually be affected by things like online fights and games. I know, I know... but still, I couldn't do it. I can only suspend belief for so long and for so much and then I need something to ground me again. The logic in this was lost on me.

It's absolutely beautiful... I didn't much care for the overall design of the online world, but it was pretty. Colors are vibrant and burst with life.

It was worth a viewing for me but my wife phased out after the first 30 minutes and only looked up between mobile game sessions. Had I seen this before, I wouldn't have bought it... but I took the risk. Would have been a better rental for me. Anime isn't for everyone and I know I'm being too critical... but it just didn't hit that sweet spot for me, personally.",1455235200,5,2221,4.268408551068884

As a Japanese family gathers for the matriarch's 90th birthday, a rogue computer program creates a global crisis. But a few key people at this family gathering take on crucial roles in restoring order to our internet-dependent society. Scenes of thoughtful family drama alternate with fantastical scenes set in the virtual world. The animation is stunning in both modes. The plot is just complex enough to make it entertaining for adults and children alike.",1453507200,,615,5.03921568627451

There were aspects that hearkened back to the best days of Digimon while at the same time retaining its own heart and originality.

I am kinda impressed by this movie. Lovely characters, animation, story, and one of the best animes I ever seen. It is a mix of action (in both, the real and virtual worlds), comedy and social criticism.

Imagine a world, where the Internet evolved. At first it was a platform for chatting, then it grew into many other directions, so right now the Internet is your second home. Every device is connected online, GPS navigation systems, the entire infrastructure, everything. You can't even use a phone without connect to this platform and register account / login to existing one. Everything is connected and works only if connected. What if something happens inside this system? This is also the main point here.

Well, however you may have a feeling of deja vu, if you ever have seen the movie called ""Digimon - The Movie"". But I seriously like ""Summer Wars"" more.",1435881600,,874,4.774834437086093

I don't like to get into much detail on the story in case some readers don't want to get spoiled, but the colorful special effects and animation blew me away, and with awesome character designs for the avatars. About a high school guy who got blamed for causing a powerful AI to sabotage OZ, he, his friends, and many more must come together to put a stop to it before the AI destroys cyberspace and the real world.

4308621,2,B004AFUJGG,"*BREIF WARNING: I don't really dive into spoiler territory, but I do touch on some. In order to fairly judge the movie, I do feel some of the story concepts need to be brought to light. I promise I try to avoid it when possible, but you have been warned.*

I had high hopes for Summer Wars. I truly did. Although I don't consider myself much of an anime fan these days (with a list of some exceptions, of course), I was all but exclusively a fan of Japanese animation in high school and college and I'm always open to giving things a try. So combined with my own interest, the high praise the movie received and a personal recommendation from a close friend, I was very excited to give this a try. Especially given that I was a huge fan of Digimon the movie and its animation.

In case it wasn't terribly obvious by now, no, I wasn't very impressed.

However, let's give credit where credit is due. First and foremost, again, the animation is spectacular. There's no denying that Summer Wars is a feast for the eyes, whether we're talking about the goings-on in the real world or the events taking place in Oz. It's all gorgeously and painstakingly animated. This much met my expectations.

And to be fair, there are some charming ideas and stories in Summer Wars. To be honest, if this had been two or three separate movies (a cyber-thriller, a slice-of-life and a romantic comedy (or just a slice-of-life rom/com, I suppose)), there's a much better chance I would have loved this movie.

But as it is, it's a bunch of good ideas that materialize into a mishmash or oddity that aside from being a treat for the eyes, is just a mess.

Firstly, we're introduced to a massive, massive family of characters. And while they're fine, most of them don't really expand beyond being one or two dimensions. Which, as any writer will tell you, is part of the problem with having such a massive cast of characters vying for screen time. Not that it can't be done, but it is difficult to do effectively.

Additionally, and to be perfectly honest, these two story threads do not synch well. I was honestly much more interested and invested in the events going on outside of Oz and cyberspace. There was a stronger story here (albeit not be by much), with themes of family and romance that I was really digging. Not that the Oz stuff couldn't have been great too, but it wasn't nearly as fleshed out. But everything goes wrong when the story attempts to tie both ideas together, and as such neither the events in Oz nor the family dynamics and drama get built-up enough for either to be that strong. What's worse, the story attempts to bring it all together is just a mess, which comes together in a finale that is so over-the-top, cliched and hokey that I simply couldn't take it seriously, and honestly found it to be kind of painful to watch. This COULD just be because I had previously seen the Digimon movie (which, as another reviewer points out, the Oz stuff is strikingly similar too), but I KNEW that the AI was going to try to do SOMETHING involving a nuclear strike.

None of the characters besides Kenji, the grandmother, her ""prodigal son"" (who's name escapes me) and Natsuki have much depth, and even that's a bit of a stretch. Which isn't to say that the other characters aren't charming or enjoyable, but Heaven help me if I could tell you any of their names or describe them in any way other than an exaggerated anime/manga trope or a profession.

And now, here's some of the nitpicks:

1. The romance: Wow, this felt forced. Besides the fact that the crush Natsuki had on her uncle (...ick) is all but quickly dismissed as a side point, we have little explanation on how Kenji and she know each other. So unless we're just expected to believe that at the end of a four day trip they just decided to be an item, this is a stretch.

And yes, I'm aware that this is common in fairy tales and no, I don't mind the idea overall. But even most fairy tales give our protagonists like...a week or two to get to know each other.

2. The US Military is the bad guy. Like another reviewer, I found that kinda offensive and a bit of a cop-out, but that's okay. That's not my biggest concern with it. And I although I don't agree personally, it's arguable that it's about as fair as always making the Russians or Chinese or middle east the bad guys.

My BIGGEST concern with the idea is that it simply doesn't make sense. I could buy that the US Military would purchase an AI program with the intent of weaponizing it. I would even buy them testing it out in a civilian setting as opposed to a closed setting. It's a stretch, but sure, stranger things have happened in real life.

But here's the thing.

WHY would they test it out in the most powerful, important, global community that apparently everything from online shopping to traffic programs and hospital equipment is tied to? The US Military would NOT want something to backfire in there face so largely and publicly, because that's massively stupid and the last thing they would want when testing a secret military program is to draw attention to it.

3. Speaking of Oz, can we just be honest here? It makes no sense. None. Whatsoever.

So, it's an online community that connects you to major retailers, has a global presence, and you can even tele-commute using it. It's also like WoW or similar programs, as it has a fighting game and customizable avatars built in.

Okay, sure. That mostly makes sense.

But...why would any government body willing put more than its contact info in there (or maybe a lobby with basic info, I suppose) into such a program, especially in light of the movie's plot? Did the world governments seriously not suspect someone might try to hack into this thing and take control of everything? And, for that matter, why would a city tie its controls into it? Or a GPS manufacturer? Or a hospital?

Think about it. That's like saying your local hospital is 100% dependent upon Facebook being up and running.

THAT. DOESN'T. WORK. And I can't suspend my disbelief enough to think anyone else besides private companies and general public would subscribe to that.

So let's sum everything up here. Is Summer Wars the worst anime I've ever seen? Of course not. As I said, in fact, there are some great ideas buried in there that could be used to make some really strong (but separate) animes. And again, in terms of pure visual appeal, it's dynamite. The dub cast was pretty great too, and the music, though not particularly memorable, is serviceable.

But the problem is is that the whole thing doesn't function well as a singular movie. It's also riddled with cliches, flaws in logic and one-dimensional characters that we as the audience are simply supposed to ignore in order to enjoy the movie. And generally speaking, no, I don't subscribe to that idea.

Apparently, I'm in an unpopular minority, and I suspect this review will be treated as such, lambasted by the movie's fans simply because ""I didn't get it"" or some similar argument. And that's fine. I'm not saying that those of you who enjoyed it should feel ashamed for doing so.

But for those of you who are on the fence or curious, I suspect a rental is best, but otherwise it's not really worth the time.",1411257600,12,7242,4.543778801843318
4308622,5,B004AFUJGG,"This movie is fantastic! I ordered it and got two day shipping, so it came super fast. The dvd's and case were in perfect condition- no dented box, scratched cd, etc. As far as the movie itself- It's basically about a world where most everyones business is conducted through the digital world- banking, shopping, etc. with little avatars. However, trouble arises once a virus gets into the system and the protagonist, Kenji, is suspected as the perpetrator! Together with the help of his friend Natsuki (his crush who asks him to pretend to be her fianc for her grandmother) and her giant, colorful family! It's a really great movie, fun to watch (I watched it with my younger siblings and they loved it as well). Great service, great movie, would recommend!",1410825600,,758,4.793893129770993
4308623,5,B004AFUJGG,"Great anime with a strong theme of family always being there for you. This anime movie has the most believable and most likeable characters I've seen in a long time. I picked up my copy not knowing what it was about and only remembering ""it's good"" from somewhere I read on the internet a few years before buying it. I am totally glad I bought it.

Animation style:  There are two animation styles the ""real world"" and the ""in-game world"".  The real world looks pencil-drawn and kind of low quality and the in-game world looks crisp, clean, high quality digitally drawn (in a good way), and just plain fun to look at.

Story: There's a really strong ""family is forever"" theme in the movie that I totally ended up loving by the end of the movie. That's probably biased but I don't care, I loved this movie by the end of it without having any knowledge of the story before starting it.  Anyway, on with the actual story.  There's a game called Oz that has become so big that it is a part of everyday life everywhere (it reminded me of the same way that Facebook can be found and connected to from any website on the internet) that you can do your job from, play other games at, pay bills, and do just about anything while accessing it from anywhere: a computer, smartphone, basically anywhere with an internet connection.  A password-hacking AI steals everyones' account in this game world and uses it to wreak chaos on the real world.  Want to mess up the electric grid in real life? It just has to use the electric company's president's Oz account.  Want to send all satellites in orbit on a rocket course to Earth and kill everyone in the impact zone? It steals the Oz account of the space program's boss.

This movie made think ""this could actually be our future"" in the sense that there will probably be a website or program that is integrated with all of real daily life and all somebody has to do to cause chaos or anything else is to hack that website's account, whatever it is.",1410307200,,1984,4.440771349862259

This movie gets me right here. (Que confused looks of readers who can't see me pointing at my heart)
The Elements of Family hit right at home. The Story draws you in and brings you to the edge of your seat. The animation was great too! the characters were always moving and their movements were very fluid. As far as the Dub... Bravo Funimation! Another Great Job. (I haven't seen it subbed though.) Characters... Well I Liked them. Their interactions were great. Their writing was great! I Just Love this Movie!!

4308635,5,B004AFUJGG,"I become a fan of almost any anime I start watching. But the guidelines for me when I'm asked ""what's your favorites?"". It has to have a good solid story. I personally enjoy watching through a series and am able to find that what the characters are going through or dealing with can someway be translated to something I find relatable to me in my life or a past experience in my life (regardless of the genre) and in some cases with a series or movie I am often moved to tears of either happiness or sadness. My peers see me as being the shoulder to cry on when someone is feeling weak and need somebody to be strong for them. So when I come across animes that can pull those emotions from me, it says a lot for that show or movie's storyline and that it has been delivered flawlessly. Sorry, I don't get into descriptives on what happens in the film or series, The way I like to deliver my reviews is inform readers how the movie affected me, if I enjoyed it, and whether or not I ultimately think it's worth their money. and this movie definitely falls under my personal guidelines as a great watching experience.",1408492800,,1115,4.314285714285714

I usually don't write a summary on films or shows but if you have seen Live free or Die hard with Bruce Willis and liked it you will love this. A peaceful and satisfying film. The characters are instantly at your doorstep due to the familiarity you will have with them. With Films like these will fill that empty hole in every anime fan after the departure of Miyazaki.

4308654,4,B004AFUJGG,"To give a brief sumary of the film - it is a heartfelt tale of family values, and how these values are tested when a rogue-AI wrecks havoc in a virtual-reality world. A much more detailed review can be found by GRArkada on YouTube.

Going along with Arkada's primary criticism, is that very few of the family members featured in the film grow beyond their initial cardboard cut-out stereotypes. But those that do break the mold (such as the Grandmother) help to counter-balance this weakness.

Regardless, it deserves a place in your anime collection as another successfull production from the mind Mamoru Hosoda! :)",1404950400,,616,4.913461538461538

There is adventure and awesome battles set in a technological context. Of course the film had elements of courage, fun/play, resilience, global community, self-discovery... Overall a fantastic film and would greatly be enjoyed by people who like what I just stated. Take a chance, sit back, and enjoy a new adventure! (:",1403913600,,481,4.807228915662651

Right from the start the movie had me hooked.  I will not go into details on the plot as you can read that in the description or in other reviews.  I will say that the picture and music were amazing.  And if you don't love the characters by the time you finish this anime...well I don't know what to say because you will love them.  To summarize, this is a funny well thought out movie with vivid colors, a fun plot, and funnier characters.  If you are on the fence, get off of it and purchase this movie.

4308661,4,B004AFUJGG,"This is odd, even for a Japanese movie - but most of all it is FULL of profanity.  I'm no prude - trust me - but I had gotten this hoping my young children could watch it and it surprised me.  Nothing wrong with profanity, but be aware that it is there and if you don't like profanity in your movies or movies for your children then surprise, surprise, this one is loaded.

Even with the profanity issue aside, it was an interesting and intriguing move - but so strange!

Someone has taken over a ""facebook"" of the future where everyone interacts socially, pays their bills, and untold other things.  Basically if this ""facebook-like entity"" is hacked, then doom awaits.  In fact, it is tied into the military and can even be used to launch missiles and such.  Sort of a War Games meets Japanese Anime in the future... somewhat interesting and thought provoking and somewhat immature and childish in the imagination of the computer program and its ability to manifest in real-world ways from time to time.

Overall, worth the watch - it stays with you for a couple of days for sure.",1401667200,,1082,4.541237113402062

I've seen a few Satoshi Kon films and a few others, but this movie is by far one of the most adventurous. It's a fun ride from the beginning. So reminds me of the Digimon Movie from when I was younger except a totally different version more for adults. I realize its made by the same person, which makes it ten times more awesome. The animation is beautiful, the characters are absolutely remarkable and memorable, and the story ranges from delightfully funny to dramatically being on the edge of your seat. You just might tear up now and then, because the story is so gripping. You'll be left feeling so satisfied with the story, you'll want to watch it again and again.

4308683,4,B004AFUJGG,"It took awhile before I warmed up to this intentionally confusing animated feature.  Initially, the screen is bombarded with fun colorful images as the complicated plot slowly plays out, alternating between an overused plot ploy (presenting the fake fianc at an enormous family reunion), and the potential danger of cyber terrorism impacting the world.  Somehow, these two events are inextricably linked.  Naturally, the villains of this scenario are the US army, having bought the Love Machine for its military application (the Love Machine is an AI creation of one of the disgruntled members of the aforementioned large family).  The intent of this creation has to do with identity theft, Internet accounts being hijacked, any and all systems that rely on Internet applications being put in jeopardy (the fire department, traffic control, medical, et cetera).  Then the Love Machine hijacks a space probe and sends it hurtling towards the earth and any number of nuclear facilities.  It's up to this boisterous family to save the world and themselves.

The plot is at times frustrating and fun, if not jarring, as it fluctuates wildly between slapstick and peril.  But it does point out the mistake in having too much reliance on systems controlled by others.  As a cautionary tale it definitely works.  And it was pretty entertaining also.  It's a keeper.",1395792000,,1358,5.155251141552512

4308696,5,B004AFUJGG,"this is one of the few cases where an animated movie can not only appeal to kids and adults, but also beat out most live action movies in terms of bringing realistic characters to the screen. seriously, the whole movie feels like a visit to a relative's house, but with a lot more action. one bizarre combo, but by some miracle, it works beautifully.

(for those of you who want to see an earlier version of this, see the short digimon movie ""Children's war game"" (which is the best and only worthwhile piece of the digimon movie) directed by the same guy, after making it i feel he said ""wow. i like this, if only it was longer... and had better characters and drama"" thus summer wars was made)",1393718400,,695,4.387596899224806
4308697,4,B004AFUJGG,"This movie is a good enough, but it is a bit of a mish-mash. It's a computer hacking adventure story mixed together with a touching family reunion story. It almost seems to work, but not as well as one might like. In some ways, it might have been better to have just made two movies. To be honest, the computer hacking adventure was the weaker part for me, possibly because I had my own computer hacking adventures well before the age of avatars and virtual reality, so that stuff tends to feel added on. It might work for a more general audience, but when you've watched the Forbin Project with the whole Artificial Intelligence lab shouting control-S, flush that stuff, beside one, it's hard to take CGI world spaces seriously.

I did like the family story which touched all of the bases having its outsider, matriarch, and black sheep, along with all the family stories and dynamics. That the family was an old samurai family still living in its old fortress and reliving old battles with the Tokugawa clan made it even more fun. Still, I've been trained to expect more emotional growth to be revealed in  such stories. There is some, but it feels a bit pasted on. I would have liked to have seen more focus on the characters than on the avatars.

It was fun enough to watch, and the basic idea was good. I just think there was a mismatch in the two stories told.",1393545600,,1366,4.477911646586345

I've never seen an anime in Bluray before, and noticed a big step up in quality. The visuals looked so crisp.
English Dub was actually not bad...I usually can't stand it, but it fit right in.
Putting subtitles on would ruin it a little though. Some text didn't match with the English Dub...must have been a translation for the the Japanese Dub. Though note that the problem is very minimal.

If you're looking for a densely woven plot, look elsewhere. The plot for this one is very much akin to a children's movie. If you're looking for a fantastic ride with great characters and wondrous animation? You found it, and you won't find much better.",1389484800,2,511,4.494623655913978

4308725,5,B004AFUJGG,"I ordered this on sale last year (2013). I'd never seen any trailers for it, it just looked like a decent action anime. Well, last year my grandmother died. After the memorial service I was sitting in my apartment looking for something to keep my mind off the obvious when I remembered this. So I put it in the player, wrapped up in the blanket that my granny had given me when I was five years old, and started watching. Then I started crying for pretty much the entire movie (those who know the plot know why).

By the title and the front cover, I was expecting an action focused movie of some sort I could use to escape. It wasn't. This movie is very much character and dialogue driven. A major part of the ""Summer Wars"" story is a granny, who is very much like how my granny was (strong and independent, yet faithful and loving), and the effect her life has on those around her and on, by extension, a major international disaster. It is a story about the strength derived from family and love. I highly recommend it to anyone who had a granny that they loved very much.

The movie itself is extremely well made. The quality of voice acting is excellent, including the dub (I know this is an ancient debate, but for me, dubs are still marginally inferior to subs, most of the time). I watched it once in English and once in Japanese (because I felt like crying more, apparently) and I think I actually preferred the English version.

The animation is amazing, along with the music. This is a Studio Ghibli-class release. Whoever the writers and directors are for this, I hope they make tons more movies, because with Miyazaki retiring, we need this type of high quality, highly imaginative, yet human, work.",1389312000,3,1711,4.495176848874598

4308739,5,B004AFUJGG,"This is the middle section of the Digimon movie, just done 10 times better and it can stand alone as a feature film. Conveniently, it is done by the same director as the Digimon movie, so he's essentially just remaking his own idea. And it's fantastic.

When the movie shows the world of OZ, it is joy to watch all of the craziness of a computer virus running wild. This is what you're coming here to watch. The concept of OZ almost makes sense. A social community that evolved to cater to business and transaction and eventually caught on and spread across the world. A lot of the avatars are cutesy little characters that you would imagine when thinking of Japan, but when the serious players step into the spotlight (King Kazma (who is an absolute badass), Love Machine, Natsuke and some of her family members) they are designed more intricately and they stand out.

However, the real core of the story is Kenji, Natsuke, and the ""Jinnouchi Clan"". Kenji and Natsuke's relationship progresses fairly realistically and the extended family is crazy and you grow to like them just as Kenji does. And, it's one of the few movies that really allows a lot of characters to play a necessary role in the plot. I can't go into it without spoilers, but you'll figure it out when it starts to happen. But, the plan requires, I think, 29 people to pull it off performing a multi-stage plan. And it's really gratifying to see people pull together when times are tough.

The animation is top notch, the music is wonderful, and voice acting is great. And yeah, it's got a lot of anime tropes which I normally can't stand, but they're employed non-intrusively, for the most part. Overall, it's a great movie and is now my favorite non-Ghibli anime, thanks to Toonami's movie month. Check it out if you're interested.",1387238400,2,1802,4.6426332288401255

4308742,4,B004AFUJGG,"Anime is usually a niche entertainment, but there are those anime movies that transcend the genre and become movies that everyone can enjoy. Mamoru Hosoda's ""Summer Wars"" is one such film. It's not just a great anime movie; it's a great movie period.

I first saw ""Summer Wars"" recently in the best possible way: knowing little to nothing about it. Heck, I didn't even know it existed until a an acquaintance mentioned it. So, based solely on that, I got it from Netlix, watched it and man, did I enjoy the heck out of it. I even bought it!

Okay, enough about me, let's discuss the movie itself. To put it in the simplest terms, ""Summer Wars"" is a combination of family drama and cyber thriller. It's every family gathering movie you've ever seen, but done a million times better mixed with ""War Games"" and ""Tron"" (as well as a segment from ""Digimon: The Movie"" which was also directed by Hosoda). As crazy as that sounds, it actually works! The reason is because not only is the thriller stuff, well, thrilling, we also love this family.

The Jinnouchi Clan is a very large, extended family with a colorful history and tonsof personality. [Granted, there are so many of them that it does get confusing as to how each person is related to the other (the protagonist's reaction after he's introduced to each member is spot on), but hey, that's the way it is in real life as well.] The wise old matriarch (who has one of the movie's best scenes) and the fish market owner who is very proud of his family's background and is always willing to tell tales of his ancestors are my favorites, but everyone is charming and memorable in their own way. The movie may be a thriller on the surface, but they are the true heart of the film.

Of course, I can't talk about an animated film without mentioning the animation and man is it gorgeous. Both the virtual Tron-like world  and the countryside setting that most of ""Summer Wars"" takes place in are beautiful to look at.

Is ""Summer Wars"" a perfect movie? Not at all. The first 20 minutes run a bit slow (this is mainly due to character introductions so it's not too big of a deal) and there were a few scenes that made me roll my eyes, but that's honestly more nitpicking than anything else. When all is said and done,  ""Summer Wars"" is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in quite some time, anime or not.",1386288000,,2357,4.467441860465116

Although I wouldn't consider myself as part of the hardcore anime crowd, I used to belong to an anime club in high school (back in the early 00s) and have casually remained a fan of anime since then. Summer Wars is an anime which is surprisingly beautiful. I am glad that it retained actual human traits (drawing/artwork) and wasn't all CGI/special effects. Another reviewer likened Summer Wars to some of the works of Miyazaki; if you are a fan of Miyazaki or his works, you will definitely like Summer Wars. Overall, I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for something new and refreshing, but doesn't want something too far off from the feel of traditional anime.",1385510400,,762,4.6940298507462686
4308747,5,B004AFUJGG,This movie is amazing and I was very surprised how good it was. A must have for Anime fans. The story is funny and has depth for most of the characters and spends enough time filling out their personalities throughout the film. It's light hearted at times and dead serious at other times. Plenty of ups and downs through out the film that is just fun to watch. I'd recommend it to any one who is looking for a good watch and a surprise from what the cover seems to offer.,1385510400,,471,4.186813186813187
4308748,5,B004AFUJGG,"Admittedly the purchase of this movie was based on a whim, however after watching this movie I am glad I made this purchase.  The story line of the movie is wonderful, creative and endearing.  A must have for individuals both new to anime and long time anime lovers.",1385164800,,266,4.520833333333333
4308749,5,B004AFUJGG,"Quite possibly my favorite anime movie. At the very least, tied with Princess Mononoke. It was just plain wonderful. The world within the internet universe created here was magnificent. The animation was gorgeous and the characters memorable. If you love anime, you likely saw this one already. Nothing more to be said.",1385164800,,319,5.153846153846154

4308751,5,B004AFUJGG,"One of my favorite movies! Entertaining and compelling from start to finish! Beautifully animated with an engrossing story and a lively cast of characters!

A great movie for families to watch! The kids will be entertained by the wild variety of characters and action, and the adults will be entertained by the fast dialogue and subtle humor.

Overall, the movie has a lot of heart and is fun to watch!",1384387200,,402,4.728571428571429
4308752,5,B004AFUJGG,"I gave my friend my normal dvd verison as she has been wanting this dvd forever, To be honest, its not all that different from the dvd version, but overall the movie itself is as awesome as always!",1383609600,,197,4.2105263157894735
4308753,5,B004AFUJGG,"I'm a huge fan of animation and sometimes viewers tire of overplayed themes, endless episodes of characters getting overpowered before a final showdown, or even avant garde studios jumping on the flavor of the year (NEETs anybody?).  Summer Wars is a one off movie that was nothing like anything I've watched.

The best description is if Studio Ghibli took a chance at doing Dot. Hack in a tasteful way.  The animation quality is vivid and colorful in both traditional and CGI effects.  I very much enjoyed their interpretation of what the ""internet"" would look like instead of a dreary cyberpunk Matrix green and black (I love Ghost in the Shell).

What the story does well is develop a genuine identity for the cast of characters in one big swing rather than draw out each and every personality.  Anyone who's ever sat down at large family gatherings such as Holidays, birthdays, weddings and such, will know exactly what I'm talking about.  At the swirling center are the characters who seem even more caught up in the events and only shine in their smallest of abilities but enough to impact the people around them.

The DVD itself like many released these days is incredibly sparse, so expect a dub, a sub, and some trailers.

This is a great own if:
-you enjoy movies with dual planes of existence (real world vs virtual world)
-want a non-gory, non-violent movie with development and conflict
-seriously, if you come from a large family...it plucked a heart string for me
-want a good example of modern Japanese animation and technique

Skip it if:
-you only enjoy combat heavy anime (DBZ, Bleach, Naruto, Shigurui)
-want to watch an epic...it's not short, but you won't feel like you walked away from Mononoke or Evangelion
-if you're into collecting catchy theme songs or musical scores...Final Fantasy fans know what I'm talking about

Koi koi!!!",1382313600,,1856,4.86031746031746
4308754,2,B004AFUJGG,"First, let me say that this is a very nice looking movie visually, the OZ sequences were very impressive, though I have to mention 90% of the movie takes place in the real world in a Japanese household and not in OZ. I'm not trying to be insulting, but this movie tries way to hard to be ""heartwarming"", and in so doing comes off incredibly cheesy and corny to me, as some other reviewers have mentioned as well. The idea of a family going into a virtual world to save the planet just seems kind of dumb to me, and I think it was the part when the old man whipped out his DS and came to Kazuma's rescue (and yeah, you're supposed to take that seriously- it's not a comedy) that I just laughed and kind of gave up on the movie. I think it's trying to be kind of a Studio Ghibli type film, but I've never seen a Studio Ghibli movie that stoops to the level of melodrama that Summer Wars does. If you have a high tolerance for sappy saccharine you'll probably like it, but it wasn't for me.",1381536000,4,987,4.119170984455959

Solid pacing, fun, great suspenseful moments, scenes that will tug at your heartstrings, and even cool action moments! This movie has almost everything, and the romance doesn't feel as forced as it usually does. It's very cute and charming, and the characters are instantly likeable.

I will say as always this movie is not really for kids I suggest watching it first or look at the rating and make a judgment call cause not all cartoons are for kids.,1377561600,,367,4.111111111111111
4308762,5,B004AFUJGG,This is a great anime and brought faith that you can make one that is family oriented where the family seems very real they have problems but there doing the best they can not everyone's bad or good it's just life and what's truly important.

What I will tell you is that few things EVER move me to 1) get teary and / or 2) watch the feature more than once immediately following the credits; well, there are onions hereabouts and I'm on the third time through and this ""rental"" copy doesn't even have director or performer commentary [if there is such a thing @ English language] so...

This is quite a rare thing in ANY film medium & it is HIGHLY recommended; purchase, rental, streaming... this one is worth it.

ps - like Miyazaki's works this one is safe for all ages, even though it does have a scary moment or two, it also contains multiple positive life lessons that are rarely found in any medium so mark this one as ""for family"" even if they claim not to like anime... people need to get over that anyway, don'tcha think...",1376179200,,998,4.442622950819672

I recommend purchasing it, though, because this is a great product, and you will be granted the luxury to view it at any time. As for why it is so good; as the description, and other reviews state, on the surface it's about a battle in cyberspace that leads to dire consequences, but it is so much more than that. There is themes of family, friendship, courage, satire of current society, and more that when combined, all boils down to a must-see movie.

This causes everyone to assume him to be the author of a hostile takeover of a virtual world... and telling the rest would spoil it.

4308812,5,B004AFUJGG,"I found out about this movie because I am a big fan of the Miyazaki films, and the other movie by the same director, Mamoru Hosoda, was listed in my recommended movies from Amazon (because I liked the Miyazaki films).  When the other film, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, went out of print, I decided to purchase this one just in case it also went out of print.  I ended up snatching it up for $12.50 on black Friday 2012 without really knowing anything about the movie, and wow, am I glad that I did.

I watched the movie last night with my wife, and was totally shocked at what a great movie this is.  I skimmed the description and some of the other reviews, and I was under the impression that this was a movie about people using magical animals to do battle.  I was completely wrong, and to my surprise, it was a zany story about two kids who are thrown in to a situation where they need to save the world from a malicious AI that takes over the Internet.

The story starts out so completely normal, similar to Miyazaki's films, then the protagonists are thrown into a completely surreal adventure.

Audio

The audio is excellent.  It really makes good use of the 5.1 surround sound, I really enjoyed the entire experience.

Video quality

The video quality is very good.  Definitely on-par for an HD animation.

The art in this film is just fantastic.  There are so many really cool scenes where there are huge over-the-top action with things crashing, fights, explosions.  The landscape and the detail are all very good.

Story

This is just an all around great story.  You really get to love the characters and you really are pulled into the moment.  I really got attached to all of the characters; I really can't say enough how much I loved this movie.

4308814,5,B004AFUJGG,"Beyond the title, pretty much all I knew about Summer Wars before watching it was that it's by the same director as The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.  The cover showed a cast that appeared to be of the fantastical sort and led by an anthropomorphic rabbit.  Based on this limited information (and determined not to gather more since I enjoy going into movies ""blind""), I put off watching this until I was in the mood for what I thought be an offbeat magical adventure.

I was way off track.  Summer Wars not only isn't what I expected, but is a refreshingly unique, equal blend of abstract elements with those grounded in reality.  The animation is wonderful, both in the subdued qualities of Natsuki's countryside home and the stark vibrancy of Oz.

I'm going to avoid any plot details or summary for the sake of anyone who'd like to watch Summer Wars unfold with the same curiosity and wonder I did (and others can simply read the product description).  Simply put: it's a fun, multi-layered, character driven movie.

While comparisons to The Girl Who Leapt Through Time would be unfair since the movies are so different in pace, scope and feel, Summer Wars achieves the same level of quality and both are practically ""must-watch"" for any fan of anime.

4308821,5,B004AFUJGG,"Asia, and Japanese anime in particular, is prolific at creating hybrids of unlikely genres and themes, but the excellent Summer Wars is one of the most unique yet - crossing a highly quirky and touching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whisper-of-the-Heart/dp/B000CDGVOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whisper of the Heart</a>-type tale with a visually mindblowing technothriller with apocalyptic touches.

Math genius Kenji is a student who works part-time as one of thousands of freelance programmers for 'Oz', a near-future unbiquitous cyber-entity that basically is connected to everything (imagine if YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Tweet, Google, the world's banks, and all the governments's computer data networks merged into a single huge conglomerate).  During holidays, his dream girl Netsuki - with whom he has only a casual acquantaince - convinces him to do a small favor for her - return home with her during the holidays and pose as her boyfriend.  (Why she's so frantic to find someone to fulfill this unusual task is part of a wonderful little subplot that unfolds as the movie goes along)  This favor is not exactly a hard sell for Kenji, it's more like winning a precious fantasy come to life.  Shortly before departing, in an unconnected event that will later have deep reprecussions during the vacation at Netsuki's family country home, Kenji is one of numerous people around the world who receives a mysterious email challenging the recipient to solve a numbers/logic puzzle.  Turns out, Kenji is the only one on the planet who manages to complete the task.

Meanwhile, as all this is going on in the real world, you see a lot taking place within the Oz network, where users enter a virtual reality type domain using imaginative avatars for everything from socialization to communication to banking to virtual gaming and beyond.  The visuals and imagination and use of color inside the Oz-world are just amazing.

As events unfold at Netsuki's family home (a really cool, unusual tale full of memorable characters, effective drama and the kind of genuine comedy that so many movies in the comedy genre fail to attain) the seemingly impossible happens: the Oz network is hacked, putting everything from personal information to traffic control to the electricity grid and even the codes for nuclear weapons in unknown, ominous hands.

I'm not going to reveal any more of what happens here, I may have said too much already (even though you kind of get most of this from the back of the DVD box); the surprises are better left experienced rather than given away in spoilers.  I'll just make a few random observations: Kenji and Netsuki are one of the best couples to appear in a romantic movie, with a rare chemistry that really makes you root for them to get together.  The entire cast is quirky and excellently done - one thing I noticed is how the children of the family, often seen doing their own thing in the background, seem so lifelike in their little ways and mannerisms.  The visuals are great throughout, and inside Oz they just get progressively more awesome as the movie unfolds.  The climaxes to the movie's various plots are tremendous.

Summer Wars is up there with anything Studio Ghibli has done (I consider that the utmost praise) and is one of those movies that makes you wonder why on Earth anime has, outside of Asia and a couple other countries, yet to break out beyond its dedicated cult following (of which I consider myself part) and start being embraced by legions more fans.",1349049600,2,3555,5.105172413793103

This is the type of movie anyone will like, even if they aren't hardcore anime fans (like me). Watch it by yourself or with the whole family! So many movies nowadays have no deeper meaning, or are simply newer versions of older movies (I think we can agree that Hollywood is running out of ideas), but this movie really touched my heart.

For some reason, I really like the DVD itself. It has a cardboard overlay that displays the characters as they are in Oz, and then the DVD package shows the characters as they are in real life. The inside has a family snapshot, and the CDs each have a very cute character icon. On packaging alone I'm sold!

4308827,5,B004AFUJGG,"Anime films have been the type to make a major crossover from Japan to the United States when it comes to the US mainstream audience. While anime series typically still remain the realm of the hardcore fans of the genre the stand-alone films get much more love from mainstream critics and audiences in addition to the hardcore. One such film which looks to have made a successful mainstream crossover to the United States was the anime film Summer Wars which was originally released in Japan in August 1, 2009. The film saw it's American debut at film festivals around the country in 2010, but since I saw it in late May 2011 I consider it a 2011 release for me thus qualifying it as one of the best films of 2011.

Summer Wars was the project of director Hosada Mamoru whose previous stand-alone anime film, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, was well-received by fans and critics alike. Working from a screenplay by Okudera Satoko (adapted from a story written by Hosada himself), Summer Wars was a nice blend of science-fiction, romance and Japanese slice-of-life. The story begins with the introduction and explanation of the OZ on-line community which becomes a major focal point to the film's story and the many characters in it. OZ was explained as an on-line, social networking community which has become so ingrained in the world community that everything anyone does was done through it's portals. Think of OZ was an amalgamation of Facebook, Second Life, iTunes, Netflix and every other social networking site all working under one umbrella. It's a virtual world where people just don't socially interact through games and chat lobbies, but also a place where every real-world store has a portal where people could purchase things online. It's also become a palce where governments from local cities to whole countries have set-up their own areas that would control their cities and countries' infrastructures. It's Facebook on steroids.

One of the film's main characters happens to work as a part-time moderator for OZ. Koiso Keiji also happens to be a 17-year old math whiz who would become instrumental in the story to come. The bulk of the story has Keiji being invited by a high school friend in Shinohara Natsuki (explained to him as a job she needs for him to do) to come with her to her family estate where he ends up meeting the rest of Natsuki's very extended family and also it's soon-to-be 90-year old matriarch in Jinnouich Sakae. This part of the film makes up the romance and it's comedic aspect as Keiji gets introduced by Natsuki to her great grandmother Sakae as her boyfriend and future fiance much to Keiji's surprise. As Keiji tries to awkwardly play along with Natsuki's plan the second part of the film's story kick's in as he inadvertently assist someone or something into hacking into OZ and begin a sequence of events which threatens every account in OZ, but later on even threaten the world.

This part of the story actually worked quite well due to the recent major hacking of Sony's Playstation and Qriocity networks which gave hackers access to tens of millions of account users' info. It was hard not to think about this real-life event as something similar (albeit much more massive and danegrous in scope) occurred in Summer Wars. The fact that the film was completed in 2009 and the Sony hack happened just a month ago was real life copying fiction instead of the other way around. It's this part of the story's plot which added to the thrilling aspect of the film as Keiji and others (mostly the extended Jinnouichi Clan he meets) try to take on the cause of the OZ hack (which we quickly learn wasn't a person but an advanced A.I. program released by the U.S. Army into OZ to test it's capabilities not knowing it would become self-aware and hard to control).

Weaving in and around this science-fiction are some of what makes some Japanese anime so easily accessible to those outside of Japan. We see a slice-of-life that, at first looks to be typical Japanese daily life, but as the story moves along becomes something that everyone would recognize and have some sort of kinship with no matter their race or culture. It's the theme of family togetherness even through adversity and the occassional disagreements between family members. It's here we see Natsuki's great grandmother Sakae show the need for the family to always find time to sit down and eat dinner together no matter what problems each and everyone may be having. It's these very serene, at times quite hilarious, scenes of family life with the Jinnouichi Clan that Summer Wars will tug at audiences' heartstrings and cause more than just a few to tear up. Some have said these scenes were too maudlin and corny, but I look at that complaint as people trying to project their own cynical nature on what was really an honest look at family life and how keeping a family together through adversity (both big and small) becomes a reward unto itself.

The Japanese voice cast did quite a good job bringing their animated characters to life from the main leads in Keiji, Natsuki and Sakae right up to the little children who added some levity to the situation. While I try to always watch anime with the Japanese language on with English subtitles for Summer Wars I also watched it with the English-voice dubbing. I was surprised to hear that the English-dubbed version was not as bad as most anime dubs and was actually quite good. Summer Wars looks to boast a who's-who of English dub voice actors which probably lent itself to a quality dubbing in the end.

Summer Wars was produced by one of Japan's major animation studios with Madhouse and the look of the film bears this out. The virtual world which made up OZ looked beautiful and made great use of CGI-animation. The avatars used by OZ account members were inventive and a menagerie of characters that all looked to be very distinct each and everytime a new one came on the screen. The animation for the real-world aspect of the film used traditional hand-drawn animation. While it didn't have the sheen and flash of most anime series the flat-look and natural color scheme used for scenes when outside OZ lent a sense of realism and the natural that made it easier to get into the film. These two contrasting animation styles really helped in pointing out just how different OZ was to everything else.

Hosada Mamoru's direction keeps everything from becoming a jumbled mess as the film juggles not just two major plot threads concurrently but smaller subplots involving certain individual family members of the Jinnouichi Clan. It's a testament to his handling of the film that we're never lost as the film's story unfolds. Whether it's the fake relationship between Keiji and Natsuki becoming something more real to the prodigal son coming back to the family after a self-imposed exile of ten years right up to a high school baseball tournament involving one of the family's younger members who also happens to be a star pitcher.

In the end, Summer Wars should be seen as a landmark film that officially heralds the arrival of one of anime's great filmmakers. With the untimely passing of Satoshi Kon there's been a scramble within the anime community to find his heir apparent. Hayao Miyazaki will continue to be one of anime's godfathers and pillar of quality work, but amongst the younger generation there was really no one stepping up the way Satoshi Kon did in so short a time. I think with Summer Wars it wouldn't be too farfetched to say that Hosada Mamoru has also stepped up to join Miyazaki as one of the creative geniuses in the anime world. It also shows younger anime filmmakers that there is success to be had doing anime outside the usual mecha, mahou shoujo and shonen series which remains the backbone and meal-ticket for animation studios in Japan.

Summer Wars is an anime film that I'd highly recommend to all whether they're fans of anime or have no idea what an anime was. This anime is that good and one that deserves to be called just film without the anime tag. It will be interesting to see what Hosada Mamoru comes up with next. I, for one, can't wait to see what it is. Also, I recommend people watch this on Blu-Ray. The difference in how the animation comes across between Blu-Ray and DVD is leagues apart.",1338595200,,8307,4.74325259515571
4308828,5,B004AFUJGG,"This movie is one of THE BEST movies EVER! It's right up there with Spirited Away and all the Greats!
This is the kind of movie where by the time you watched it three times in a row your still not tired of watching it!

Oz is a huge global network that the whole world relys on to manage their daily lives, but when our hero Kenji a part time maintence worker for the program gets a code email while at the girl of his dreams Natsuki's family reuinion posing as her fake boyfriend and solves it and without meaning to lets in a AI (designed by Natsuki's uncle for the USA) into the program that is designed to be unstoppable in taking over everyones accounts and the whole program and send the whole world into desiray and eventually starts a count down for all the Nukes on earth to go off, he and Natsuki, her cousin Kazuma, and her Uncle Wabisuke and the rest of her family set off in their techy quest to defeat the AI and save the world!

Kenji (the main character) is downright smart, noble, and adorable! The perfect hero! In the end he's the one who kills Love Machine by using his techy skills at the end of the movie saving the entire world from getting nuked.

Natsuki (co-main character) is sweet in her own way, full of energy, and confident. The hero who defeats Love Machine in an epic battle intending to kill it but only ending up weakening it greatly but that's when Kenji kills it.

Kazuma AKA King Kazma (co-main character) This guy is my favorite character, he is OZ's #1 butt kicking avatar, he's one of the main family members shown in this movie and the main hero battling it off with Love Machine throughout the movie.

Natsuki's Grandma (co-main character) One of my favorite characters, she's the head of the family and in the time of the OZ crisis she shows that you don't need to be important to make a differance.

Natsuki's family is proud, full of life and togetherness and generally really good natured people, but on the down side they're pregidous against family members who aren't technically ""legitament"" and blame them for not being so. They're also pregidous against the USA.

I ended up watching this film initially based on the knowledge that the director of it was also the director for ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" (Mamoru Hosoda).  I found myself liking how the film does an interesting thing, it presents characters in two different environments, their digital avatars and their physical selves, often the digital avatars displaying aspects of the characters that may not come out in real life.  Visually the film is simply astounding, I enjoyed the incredible amount of energy and creativity the the film presented, the artwork is simply beautiful on its own right.  Finally, the film does something else, it has a heart to it, the plot, the characters, everything works together to create a genuine reaction in you (or it did for me and a few others whom I've spoken to about the film).  I really have no difficulty in recommending this to anyone looking for something a little different that is fresh.

They really got into the movie, which is hard for die hard anime fans to do, especially with a DVD movie.  I would definitely watch the movie in the Japanese with English subtitles.

The movie does start off a bit slow, but it starts moving faster and faster.  I want to say that it is probably the best movie, I have seen in the past 2-3 years.",1320105600,,444,4.176470588235294

With that being said, this is easily one of the best anime i have ever seen. The plot is thick, the characters are very well fleshed out, and the plot twists/ending were both exhilerating and held my interest every time I've watched it. I would definately say this is a family oriented film, especially considering that family is a major element.

All-in-All this is a great anime. I would suggest that you watch with friends and family or just that special someone, but if you like anime watch summer wars",1317945600,2,681,4.448
4308850,5,B004AFUJGG,"I bought the blu-ray of this movie several months ago and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie in any genre. The blu-ray transfer is vivid and the animation is very detailed and beautiful. Overall it is a very high quality product.

For those who saw and enjoyed ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", this is Hosoda's next masterpiece. For those who are not big anim fans, but enjoy the work of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, this movie will more than satisfy them and, no doubt, they will probably want to check out ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", if they haven't already.

The story of ""Summer Wars"" is rich and rewarding. We meet a nerdy young man who is tricked into being her pretend fianc by his high school's resident ""queen bee"" (most attractive and popular girl). They go to the 90th birthday of the girl's grandmother in Ueda, along with the rest of the Jinouchi family. In the middle of the first night, the boy gets a text message on his mobile phone with a code and a message ""Solve me""....
This is where things start getting interesting.

I found the film to be a very strong emotional experience. It reminded me of some times in my life with my own family. If there is any message in this film it is this: ""Never give up on family, even when the going gets rough, especially when the going gets rough.""

The film may be watched with or without subtitles in the original Japanese language. I am happy with that and it is good to hear the original voices, but I am not an original language chauvinist and the English dub is excellent. Brina Palencia (Natsuki) and J. Michael Tatum (wayward Uncle Wabisuke) are here, as they seem to be everywhere at the moment, (see ""Spice And Wolf"" and many other recent anim movies and series) and both bring much to their characters, as they always do. Both Japanese and English language versions are fabulous.

I will watch this movie again and I will enjoy it again and I think you will too.

I eagerly await Mr Hosoda's next movie. I hope it's soon!",1317859200,,2023,4.454054054054054

4308857,5,B004AFUJGG,I've loved Mamoru Hosada's work ever since i saw The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and I think Summer Wars is his best film to date.  It's funny and heartwarming and the story really does a great job of building to a narrative climax at the end.  The film is also highly relevant today when so many of the things we do day to day are controlled by computers.  It's very worthwhile to watch and I'd recommend it to anyone.

However, his SUMMER WARS is even better due to it's complexity, depth, fascinating characters, and its mind-blowing visuals. In my opinion, Mr. Hosoda has done something I didn't think possible - he's almost (a few more movies of this quality will lock it in) reached the same exalted level as Hayao Miyazaki.

I strongly recommend that you view all the films by Miyazaki and Hosoda in the original Japanese (with subtitles) if you're not watching with a small child. If you can't read, this is a good time to learn. I view all dubbing, no matter how well done, to be an insult to the actors and the director, and it always diminishes the film's overall effect.",1315180800,,744,4.723076923076923

Well, after watching it, I can say that the hype is, indeed, to be believed. From the high quality, high budget animaiton, to the amazing story within a story presentation, everything about this film shines on the same level as any of the great anime films. It is certainly the most impressive and entertaining animated feature I have seen in the last 10 years since 2001's ""Spirited Away"" awed me similarly. (Miyazaki's more recent films, Howl's Moving Castle and Ponyo, did not elicit such a response from me, as I am sort of a harsh critic.)

To put it simply, if you are an anime fan, you absolutely MUST see the movie. I would say it should be added to anyone's ""required viewing"" list. And of course, if you decide to get it, you should really get the Blu Ray! I have not seen the DVD version of the movie, but I can say that the use of HD resolution was glorious, and I can not imagine watching it in SD!

4308865,4,B004AFUJGG,"The first glimpse of this movie, I was expecting another great anime from Japan-it was delivered with great story telling, animation, and emotional draw that leaves any movie fan not just anime wanting more. The movie tells a story of High school teenagers who through angst, family commitment, and power overcome obstacles together through shared experiences and of course social networking. Think of FaceBook taking over the world in an official sense, but a hack breaks it, causing the world to collapse. The only downside to this well delivered drama is that at times it's marred with Hollywood and anime clichs; these distractions remove the viewer from focusing on the plot at hand, and at certain moments the character development. Yet, that would be the only thing that I could lament that hurts the film- at best.

4308867,4,B004AFUJGG,"Poor Kenji may be a total math geek but sometimes that's not necessarily a bad thing. The whole premise of the movie of the world wide web being taken over and corrupted is especially scary when you start to consider how more and more the world is coming to rely on easy access to the internet. Kenji offers to be a boyfriend for a weekend without really knowing what's going on and runs smack head on into a huge family with all it's pleasantries and it's problems. The in the middle of all this confusion someone steals his web alter-ego (his avatar) and starts to wreck havoc in his name.

Having married into a large (almost clannish) family I can certainly relate to the total bewilderment and wonder that Kenji experiences. The family interaction is something to behold. The sequences that take place in the virtual world are visually arresting on Blu-Ray and the action is top-notch. My wife who has only recently started enjoying the anime world claims this movie to be one of her favorites with enough comedy, drama, and action for almost everyone.

I watched this in English Language. The voice actors did a great job. No doubt there is a part of Japanese culture that is lost in translation, but it does not detract.

A cynic might say that the one thing we learn from this film is that every single person in Japan has some form of wifi game, even if only on a smartphone. Or maybe it's just this particular family?

Family connections, inclusiveness, balance, and the desire to overcome mankind-threatening AIs: these are values we can all cherish. Thank you, Summer Wars.",1313452800,,656,4.5423728813559325
4308869,5,B004AFUJGG,"I ordered this movie while serving a tour in Afghanistan.  I remember watching the trailer for this movie time and time again, anxious for its release in the U.S.  I had such an interest in this movie my friends quickly became convinced that the movie would be worth their time to watch.  Now I admit that Anime isn't for everyone.  There are several Japanese culture and subculture fillers in all of Anime that for the casual movie or TV show watcher it might be a bit over-whelming.  Summer Wars is filled to the brim with said culture and it is exactly that which makes this movie both unique and extraordinary for all.  This movie fully assumes the audience is Japanese and as such is a wonderful and colorful experience for everyone.  This may seem contradictory to the previous fact but what a great way to see the culture in its purest form.  This isn't some action film that is full of unreal scenarios or Please Teacher setting where the women are objectified, but rather this movie is a full fledged family movie both funny and exciting.
The film takes place in a modern day time setting where an MMO (massive multi-player online) system controls everything.  Everyone uses this system and even more so they depend on it.  This seems plausible considering how much we depend on technology today.  Well what would happen if something in that system went wrong?  This movie answers that question with an interesting and entertaining plot.
So if an interesting crisis plot, a love story, family oriented, and Japanese Cultured movie sounds like something you might be interest in try this movie on for size.  Forget that it is animated and try to keep an open mind.  You might be surprised how much you like it.  The people I was deployed with loved it.

This anime tells a great story based off our own world-society as a widely known and used operating system/social media is affected by an unknown user, throwing the entire world into total chaos. Family meetings, feuds, love, hate, different people joined together in an adventure of a lifetime, all under a single roof. Many compare it with famed series Digimon, but this is how Digimon should have been.

On a deeper note, it reflects mankind's almost total dependence on the virtual world on all matters, from online shopping, social sites to managing people's health, lifestyle and even further, managing proper order in cities and countries and their governments. This movie shows how fragile our real life infrastructure, dependent mostly on computers can really be. But it also shows that with determination, anything can be resolved, from family matters to world crisis, of course, determination en masse.

Also, I gave the rating 3 stars, despite my significant dislike of the movie. I tried to be fair considering the quality of picture and the gimmicks like those in Evangelion.

I personally prefer Hosoda's previous movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Who-Leapt-Through-Time-Blu-ray/dp/B004LIYF62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [Blu-ray</a>] much much much more to this piece.
Hosoda has said in a number of occasions that he has learned through his career that entertaining the audience and making what he wants to make are two distinct matters. I think he went too far in the spectrum of the former in this particular piece -- Summer Wars. I can SMELL his CONSCIOUS strategy of entertainment too much, which just turns me off seriously. Of course, as a professional, an author does have to set up a stage consciously to design a fiction. Nevertheless, I feel that a highest quality movie or novel should contain the author's genuine passion. I simply cannot feel that in this piece.

It is like a handsome man picking up a girl without much love just for one night stand, and indeed I do have to agree that Hosoda is handsome in his talent. However, I prefer falling in love with an anime, and there are many pieces to which the director and all the staff members devote whole their love.

As a concrete example, the main characters are almost all way too talented, IN A SINGLE FAMILY. My heart was much more moved by the heroin of ""The Girl ..."" movie, Makoto, who was just a pleasant ordinary girl.

I should note that this movie made a gigantic business success in Japan -- you can smell a sophisticated (?) strategy in this direction as well. They have released the ""limited edition"" of Blu-ray roughly over $120 with some special attachments like a bit of cell movie film (Japanese love special features!).

4308879,5,B004AFUJGG,"Wow... my mind has literally been blown away, something I haven't felt for a long time since first watching some of my now favourite Hayao Miyazaki's films such as Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbour Totoro, Spirited Away & Laputa, Castle In The Sky + more.

The storyline is fantastic and whilst based on technology that is superior to our own at the moment, it's actually something that could happen in the future if social networks keep growing and people give permission for them to access even more personal details, maybe not in the exact same way, however as we live in a totally internet/computer dependent society, the idea isn't as far-fetched as some may think.

One thing that you will certainly love about this film is how much emotion it pumps through you; I was laughing, crying and biting my lips in suspense all the way through the film, not once did I feel that the film was dragging on, there was always something there to keep your attention towards the film right from the beginning to the very end.

One thing I must point out is that the film is in BOTH English & Japanese audio for your own choosing, Amazon currently states it's Japanese audio only with English subtitles, so for those that are wary of buying this product because they struggle reading subtitles like I do, I can assure you that this is in English audio.

4308882,4,B004AFUJGG,"MINOR DETAILS BUT NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW

First off let me say this was a pretty good movie.  It wasn't boring and it kept my interest throughout.
However, I think people are way too liberal on giving out 5 star reviews, which is the primary reason why I am making this review.

PROS:
-Interesting
- Good, fast pace (story wise)
-Dub seemed good.  Not over the top and having the actors try to emulate the Japanese VA's which almost always comes off as strange sounding.
- Very message about family ties.  However, it was not as heartwarming as I would have liked it to be since it did feel forced and not much development between characters.
- Beautiful animation.  Very nice combat scenes. Lively colors, etc.

CONS:
- ABSOLUTELY NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.  It's hard to dislike the characters in this movie, but you just don't feel invested or connected to them and everyone is the same at the beginning of the movie and the end. I blame the fact that there are TOO many characters.
- I like the characters, but I felt that I was ""forced"" to like them.
- Corny.  Alot of the dialogue is very.....awkward.  NO one in real life would ever be able to pull of some of these lines.  The scene where the grandma wields that spear was probably meant to be emotional.  But it was just a ""What the hell was that?!"" moment for me.  I know this is an anime and I don't expect complete realism but...... this seems to be a ""slice if life"" anime but the things the characters do and the way they act don't seem realistic at all.
- Unexplained and rushed things.  I did not buy into Natsuki falling in love with the main character (not a spoiler.  This is typical of this type of story).  It just did not flow well and as a viewer I did not feel really invested in their relationship.  They didn't seem to be either, they barely even talked to each other.  Another example of the movie forcing things on us.

CONCLUSION:
It's definitely worth a purchase, it's not a bad movie by any means even with all the things I disliked about it.... but don't buy into the hype all these 5 star reviews generate or you will be disappointed.  Do not expect to be moved by this movie.  It's fairly entertaining but it won't spark much-if any- emotion.  Definitely check it out though, even if you just rent or borrow it.

4308888,5,B004AFUJGG,"So... in the near future the internet has coalesced into the online VR realm known as 'Oz'.  This online world is populated by avatars of nearly every person on Earth with access to a computer and internet.  People, companies, governments, all are online in Oz.  Very similar to the internet we know today except that this online world is hosted in a virtual reality interface of sorts.

So to the film:  Though this isn't quite as solid as their film ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", it is a stunning film nonetheless.  The animation is fantastic, especially the computer animation used to depict Oz.  The characters are all likable, and the Japanese voice acting solid.

Essentially this is a story about friendship, family, and togetherness.  There are a few sad moments, some funny moments, but overall it is very touching and heart warming.  The computer program as a villain is nothing new, but it is given a new and sinister twist in this film.  It is enjoyable to watch the main character Kenji fumble around, lacking common sense and confidence in the beginning, 'man up' as the movie progresses.  The film is well paced and I never felt it was too long or too rushed.

Madhouse has something good going and I hope to see more of these types of films being released from their animation studio.",1306022400,,1305,4.6960352422907485
4308889,2,B004AFUJGG,"The Good

1.) The film's central message is decidedly pro-FAMILY. In short, as the world goes into crisis mode, it's not the state that will be coming to save you (if you're lucky), but rather your family. And who lies at the heart of the family? The mothers and grandmothers, of course!

2.) VISUALS: Who needs Tron when you have animation like this? The animated scenes depicting the action in the digital world of OZ are really something, if not a bit confusing at times.

3.) The story's concern with the vulnerability inherent in putting so much information online makes for an intriguing commentary on our own society. Anything that CAN go wrong with the internet DOES go wrong in 'Summer Wars,' from identity theft to digital warfare to the evolution of a ""SKYNET""-like Artificial Intelligence bent on disrupting society in general. Could it happen in reality? You'll be left to wonder.

The Bad/Not-so-good:

1.) The plot jumps around quite a bit. This isn't such a bad thing considering the size of the cast and the sheer likability of the MANY characters, but the story simply loses focus. With all the time spent on the various family members and everything we learn about them, more time should have been spent with the ""main"" character prior to his exposure to this family unit. Even a brief glimpse at the boy's own home life would have benefited the plot immensely.

2.) Sorta rips off the 'Digimon' movie. Check it out if you don't believe me.

3.) Who would release an evil Artificial Intelligence creation on the world, starting in Japan? How about China, with its well-known animosity towards and rivalry with the Japanese, both as an economy and a nation in general? Or a group of multinational cyber-terrorists, or even digitally-based anarchists? Nope, nope, and nope.

*SPOILER ALERT*

The culprit is none other than America. This was a total cop-out.

I mean, let me get this straight: The US Military buys the program for an Artificial Intelligence with the full knowledge that it is designed to destabilize digital programs over the web, AGGRESSIVELY and EFFICIENTLY. So, where do they run their first test? A controlled environment, where the AI can do no serious harm? Nope! They test it on OZ, an entity that is of the utmost importance in everything from social networking to portable heart monitors. What would the US, or ANY nation for that matter, have to gain from creating the potential for such chaos??

You can call it a metaphor, or a commentary on US foreign policy, or whatever you want.

I call it shoddy storytelling, and it really hurt the overall experience.

BOTTOM LINE:

This was a pretty good story, but not a great story. Great stories grab your attention without offending your intelligence.

If you want to see a great story, check out 'Spirited Away', or any Pixar film.

And do give 'Summer Wars' a chance. For what it's worth, it's still pretty entertaining.",1305676800,17,2912,4.82897384305835
4308890,5,B004AFUJGG,"Takashi Murakami's book Superflat presents us with deep social commentary in the guise of a discussion of the sources of current trends in anime and manga in historical Japanese art.

And what might that have to do with this movie you may ask? Because more than anything else Summer Wars is the same social commentary brought to life in anime form. It looks at the conflict Japan, and the rest of the world, faces when tradition and modern technologies and trends collide. This is made visually evident in a family, portrayed in a style that deliberately gives a the flavor of Miyazaki to things going on the the real world, while the virtual world is as deliberately Murakami in its flavor.

This sets the stage for not only a battle of visual styles, but a battle of all flavors of new and old, pitting electronic networking against old fashioned connecting in person and by phone, video games against baseball, programming against pen and paper, and in the end a contest of two wills, electronic versus human.

As such it is not only a marvel to watch, but is also an incredibly revealing and very intentional piece of social commentary where the metaphorical death of the traditional makes it clear to those affected not only how important those traditions truly are but how they must adapted by the next generation to face a new world.",1305158400,,1340,4.717948717948718

4308894,5,B004AFUJGG,"You can pretty much recognize a Studio Ghibli production when you see it. Kind of think of an Anime version of Walt Disney. I happen to like them after reading more about them --they won't license an English release of their product.

Taken from Wikipedia:

""The company is well-known for its strict ""no-edits"" policy in licensing their films abroad. This was a result of the dubbing of Miyazaki's Nausica of the Valley of Wind when the film was released in the United States as Warriors of the Wind. The film was heavily edited and Americanized, with significant portions cut and the plot rewritten. The ""no cuts"" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing Princess Mononoke to make it more marketable. In response, a Studio Ghibli producer sent an authentic katana with a simple message: ""No cuts"".[4]""

I mentioned it because you can rest assured when watching this one, that you are getting the original dialog and plot without any Americanizing. This is important to me because I respect the difference in culture and want a dub to stay as true as possible to the original. I didn't watch this and come away thinking ""Hunh?"" because the edits didn't make sense.

What I will say is this. I loved this film. More than enough of these reviews will rehash the plot, so I won't do that. The setting in Oz really isn't the centerpiece of the story. It's important, but you get the feeling that you could take these characters and put them in any sort of crisis and it wouldn't matter. This film is more about the strength of family and love. I felt like the writers took a Kenji and put him into their lives to allow us to see just a small part of what can make family so great. Here you're watching from Kenji's point of view, and watching him come into his own. By just being around a family he grows out of his shyness somewhat, develops confidence in himself and learns the importance of love and how it can literally move mountains. All of this because he found a place in a family who accepted him with open arms.

This film has some genuine heart and by the end of it, my palms were sweaty and I was grinning ear to ear. I won't lie --I teared up at a few parts because it did a good job of reminding me what it can be like to lose someone important to your family, and how in times like those, we are the angels of each other's lives. Family can save you, and it also can tear you apart if you let it, and that almost happened. The characters were all wonderful and funny and quirky in the ways that make me think of my own family and I wouldn't hesitate to show this film to anyone else. There's no fan service in this film but there are a few jibes about sex --but nothing you wouldn't hear in your own home unless you're some kind of UBER prude or something.

4308898,5,B004AFUJGG,"General overview: This movie was liked by my father who usually can't stand watching anime and he actually laughed several times during it! It flows nicely and doesn't leave really any plot holes in either English or Japanese. I believe it deserves the awards it has won, and is a pleasant diversion from the boob flashing Animes that sometime seem to invade the realm of anime. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good anime mixed with laughs and drama.

Further break down:

Voice acting: It is both awesome in English and Japanese so if you don't like to read subtitles English is a good alternative. (Some of the subtitles go too fast in Japanese and clip out before the actors are done talking though.)

Profanity: This movie isn't huge on swearing, there are a few clips of it. (more in the Japanese I think.)

Nudity: There is one bath scene where the main girl is giving her siblings a bath, you see some of her chest from the side but it's not accentuated. There is a transformation sequence with about the same degree of revealing. The main male also walks into the bath (after the girl is out) with a towel covering his front.

Violence: Bloody nose and martial arts (No over the top violence really.)

Moral: This story features a good overall moral to the story, it features many aspects of what a family does, as well as sticking to something.

Characters: Each character has distinct characteristics, no one is the same, and all are funny in their own way.

Other adult material: When introducing the main male character to her family one of her relatives jokes that he must have already ""did it"" with her and that's why he's there.

4308899,5,B004AFUJGG,"I am an avid Anime fan. I actually learned Japanese in college 20 years ago (has it been that long?) for 3 years for the sole purpose of watching Anime and reading Japanese Comics (aka Manga).

Director Mamoru Hosoda made a name for himself after winning the 2007 Animation of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Who-Leapt-Through-Time-Blu-ray/dp/B004LIYF62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [Blu-ray</a>].  If people thought that win was a fluke, he came back with Summer Wars and won the same award in 2010!

Both movies have a lot in common, which stems most likely from Director/Writer Hosoda's ability to blend multiple categories such as comedy, romance, slice of life, sci-fi and drama seamlessly into a modern day culture (well, a Japanese culture in his movies).  I believe that's why he is able to draw the audience deeply not only into the movie but makes the characters more believable and likeable (unlike some Jar character in another Sci-Fi movie).

Summer Wars mixes the ""cybernet"" and the real world, making consequences in one world affect the other and vice-versa, much like the classic Tron in terms of the premise and consequences.

I was actually expecting a lot from this movie because it was Director Hosoda's 2nd movie after making The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and although the ""cyberworld"" felt a little quirky in the beginning for me, I was able to get into the movie and enjoy it even though I had high expectations.  I laughed in many parts and in other parts I really wanted to punch a couple of the guys there who didn't understand that their small actions had bigger consequences.

I found the yellow subtitles difficult to read in some places, particularly in the Oz segments (up against a white background), but the English dub will get the job done for non-speakers. The story is straightforward which is a strength and downfall because there leaves little reason to re-watch it story-wise (the richly colored Oz will entice the visual dilettante for another viewing). I only wish they developed the Kenji/ Natsuki relationship more. It is an entertaining film, extras and the story will leave a little to be desired for some.",1301961600,,781,5.198412698412699

All the other people in the movies were great and had their own personality the kids were thrown in for comic relief and just came out as an annoynce.

At the start I thought the computer generated Oz was going to be an odd addition to a story that had to do with the family party but the writer rolled them together.

4308904,5,B004AFUJGG,"I'm not a film critic. I am an anime fan. I'm a bit biased towards this movie as a result. However, this release garners 5 stars from me for several logical reasons. First of which being, the English voice-acting is of a very high quality. The translation is accurate to the spirit of original Japanese, if not the content explicitly. The actors seem very authentic, and with very few exceptions sound quite invested in their work.

That said, I prefer the Japanese. I'm familiar enough with the culture to appreciate it from an outside perspective. So why do I care so much about the English? I don't like watching movies alone, and not all of my friends and family are comfortable reading subtitles. I tell them learning Japanese is the best solution, but most aren't quite interested in becoming that invested. High-quality English makes for easy introduction to this movie.

What carries it, is the easy pace and undeniable style of the film. The visuals are stunning in their attention to detail, both in the ""real world"" and OZ centered scenes. The movie sets itself up effortlessly in just a few minutes, and then throws you into the center of the story rather quickly. Kenji's status as a math nerd and social idiot is a tried and true one, and the cool beauty of Natsuki isn't new either. Simply well executed here. Without spoiling the story too much, the introduction of Natsuki's family to both Kenji and the audience is a whirlwind (putting it lightly). While some people would argue the sheer number of characters would make them shallow and not leave time for development, I would tend to disagree. Kenji is overwhelmed at the situation, he's our protagonist so we should share that with him. That said, despite the huge number of folks flicking on and off screen the important few shine through in just the right way. The stern but loving grandmother, eccentric uncles, overbearing aunts, and annoying cousins are damn near universal in most families. They're all here too, and more like my own than I might care to admit. So, surprise surprise, it's a bit of a family film. Of course, throwing in the high-tech near-future environment of the OZ Network gives you an entirely new layer to work through.

OZ isn't too far away from how we live now. We bundle cell phones, home phones, internet, and TV. OZ is that, plus Facebook, and pretty much all of your billing and work-related systems slammed into one. Games, media, communications, business, and financial services all through one central hub. Just like in the real world, the cyber world of ""Summer Wars"" starts reaching into everyday life in very unexpected ways. Of course, things go quite a bit further in the film. This is where that little ""Deeper Meaning"" comes in. The ""Wars"" in question are between the real people of the movie and the online world they depend on day to day. The movie is a bit of a hint towards what we're heading to today with our dependence on social media and online conveniences. Most of us are guilty of it. I'm 26, of course I am. Again, trying not to give anything away here, but suffice it to say that we probably don't want to be quite as plugged in as the folks in ""Summer Wars"".

Of course, this isn't some broad-reaching culture modifying epic which will forever change movies as we know it. It is, however, an amazingly completely experience. People can argue that it's not terribly meaningful, lacks some depth, is unrealistic, or even somewhat immature. In some ways, all of that is correct. To me the strengths of this movie perfectly compliment the few weaknesses. It's a parallel of real life with a dash of science fiction and just a bit over-the-top. It's approachable, enjoyable, funny, heart-warming, heart-wrenching, and endlessly watchable. To be fair, that's all I really want from an entertainment movie. To be entertained. ""Summer Wars"" does this for me, my friends, and my family. I've seen the movie at least 5 times now, and I don't think it will wear out it's welcome anytime soon.",1301097600,,4011,4.7503586800573885
4308905,5,B004AFUJGG,"Mamoru Hosoda followed up his Academy Award-winning sci-fi shojo movie of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time with an extended remake of his original Digimon short movie(which was the second chapter in the American release of Digimon: The Movie). Summer Wars is a full-length feature blending in high school romance with digital armageddon.

At the beginning of summer vacation in Japan, math whiz Kenji is working with his buddy Takashi as a moderator for the massive online network called OZ(no Wizard Of Oz puns present)which is a virtual world similar to WOW, but with less of a midevil setting and more like playful icons involved in fighter tournaments. Kenji's cute energetic classmate Natsuki offers him another quick job to help her prepare for her great-gramma's 90th birthday. He accepts, and the two of them go off to Natsuki's family estate in the country. They are a large and diverse family descended from a samurai clan, and the great-grandmother Sakae is about everything you'd be looking for in granny. Kenji is shocked though when Natsuki claims to her family that he is her boyfriend, but she says that in order to make her grandma feel safe about her. Confused during the night, he gets a strange text message send in code, which he uses his math skills to crack, and sends it back. He awakes the next morning to see on the news that OZ has been been hacked into and that he is being blamed for it. It turns out that an A.I. program masquerading as Kenji's avatar, calling itself Love Machine. It proceeds to take over OZ, which Kenji tries to stop with a new avatar Takashi made for him, along with Natsuki's cousin who is really the brilliant game fighter, King Kazma. They tangle with Love Machine, but after absorbing a few other avatars, it goes all Super-Saiyan and kicks them out of the system. It then proceeds to infect computer systems all over the world, causing mass confusion and hysteria. Its later revealed that Natsuki's estranged uncle is the one who actually created the A.I. that the American military try to use, but it escaped into OZ. This news infuriates Sakae as she banishes him from her home. The ensuing action causes Sakae to pass away in her sleep. The family believes that Love Machine is responsible, so they pull all the stops to try and pull the plug on it. They call in resouces from all over the country, even by bringing in a huge supercomputer to back them up. Natsuki uses her superior skills at tea ceremony card playing to challenge Love Machine to a final card game. She gets help from players all over the world to shut him down. However, it causes a satellite to begin falling towards their location. Kenji hacks into the satellite's system, and has it crash near the estate.

Summer Wars features some impressive digital effects, specifically in the online world, although you sorta wish there was more added to it than the cartoonish avatars. The style used for the offline parts are a little more standard, at least for a generic non-Ghibli anime movie. The main appeal for this movie though is the compelling story, and the tightnit seperate world the family of characters exist in. They're very believable, despite some of the standard anime tropes that are present, and you can recognize at least one member of your own family in Natsuki's. This film makes for a great watch, at least as a gateway anime since it takes alot of what makes for a great story and an engaging syle.",1300838400,,3443,4.708126036484246

'Summer Wars' received really good user reviews and the story outline seemed interesting so I thought I'd give it a go. I'm way glad I did.

Here's the scoop. OZ is the new, ultimate web-site where anyone can do almost anything. It's used by individuals and governments alike. It's been inadvertently hacked into, and compromised by, a math geek who has unwittingly unleashed an AI construct that is fouling up the the whole thing.  To boot, while all this is going on, said math geek has been tricked into playing his female acquaintance's fiance at granny's 90th birthday at a huge family mansion out in the country.

It's the way the movie juggles both the main and sub-plots that puts it high on the quality scale. The animation is OK. The production design is a bit uneven. OZ is pretty cool with a great design and color palette. Some of the real life sets a very good, others are pedestrian. The character designs are OK but don't reach a level that you haven't already seen elsewhere, and some of the facial expressions don't reach beyond TV grade Anime. That being said though, overall, this is still one of the better looking pieces you'll find out there.

I had a great time watching this. I liked the story, the characters and the pace. At 2 hours I was not at all in a hurry to get things over with. The final scene is more than a bit too cute but by then, the movie was over so what the heck. I can't put this up with any of the Miyazaki films but it's still really good. If you like this sort of thing at all you probably won't be disappointed in watching this.",1300406400,,2145,4.381909547738694

I thought the characters would spend most of their time as their avatars. What I got was much better. Not a sci-fi fantasy like the Matrix or Tron but a character study in family relationships. This film was entirely fullfilling as we got to see this extended family come together through all of their difficulties and to work through their differences to accept each other as they are.

I've read the reviews on the transfer, and everyone thinks it's great, but i found it to be a ""soft"" picture.  the colors didn't ""pop"" as much as they could (except in the ""cyber-scenes""), and the black line art seemed a bit blurred and not as distinctive as other blu ray anime.  Granted, some line art in anime is thinner or thicker, depending on the movie, but it should still be very distinct and bold, not weak and slightly blurred.  It almost felt like an ""upscale"" transfer, like FLCL, just slightly better.  My TV is a new Sony and properly calibrated, new blu ray player with best cables btw.

4308918,5,B004AFUJGG,"I'm not going to go into a long descriptive paean to the film here; the visual side of the film is more than acceptable, as are the characters and the story. What I particularly enjoyed about the film is the way the individual characters interacted within the bounds of their extended family. Like most families, there are inherent tensions and conflicts - but there are also shared pasts, common interests, and a recognition of the ties that transcend the petty. It's knowing that there are people who will always have your back.

When Kenji, the introverted college student and math prodigy is inveigled into posing as the fiance of his classmate Natsuki so that she can cope with the expectations of  her extended family, he has no idea what he is getting into. A classic nerd type with a part time job doing systems upkeep on the vast virtual reality of Oz and no experience with girls (let alone one as attractive as Natsuki), he is way over his head. When he meets her vast family at the palatial estate in the country, presided over by her clan's matriarch on the occasion of her upcoming 90th birthday, much comedy and many awkward moments ensue.

While attempting to sleep the first night, a mysterious math puzzle arriving via his phone turns into an obsessive all-night effort to solve it. When he does,  his reward is not what he expects. He goes back to sleep, only to find on awakening that he's now wanted as a cyber criminal who appears to have hacked into Oz. In the ensuing confusion, Natsuki's ruse about his real identity is unmasked as well; a family member who is also a policeman hauls him off under arrest.

But the havoc now being unleashed within Oz is manifesting in the real world, which has become dependent on the cyber world as a place to meet, shop and carry on much of its business. Disorder spreads, and Kenji is brought back to the estate because massive traffic jams have made travel impossible. Now as there as himself, he begins to start finding out what is happening - and begins to really interact with Natsuki's family, which is where the story begins to take off with a number of twists and surprises.

Watching Kenji discover what he has been missing from his own life, watching him unfold and blossom as he begins to become involved with Natsuki's family is a joy, as is watching how he the outsider begins to remind the group of its own strengths and values, something that familiarity  can obscure. His interactions with the matriarch of the clan are especially pleasurable. She is one formidable old lady, and she sees more in him than he knows about himself.

The battles within the virtual world of Oz, the conflicts outside - ultimately the story is about how functioning families are made up of people who see each other for who they really are, care for each other despite the pain that sometimes results, and come together to face their challenges as a family. (Even if they are not related by blood.)  One of the turning points in the movie is seeing the ""On-line community"" in Oz suddenly become a cyber-extended family.  In a virtual world it's still possible for all the things that make us human to manifest when needed.

While there's plenty of action and suspense in the story, there's also a wealth of great character interaction on a very human level.  That's what makes this much more than just another anime film with some flashy visuals and some violent action. All in all, it's a wonderful story.

There's some extras in the DVD package I haven't had a chance to get to yet - some trading cards, and another disk full of extras. It's a nice bonus with an outstanding film.",1299542400,,3638,4.613003095975232
4308919,5,B004AFUJGG,"Stunning animation within the technological world of ""Oz"", even better outside in the real world. The problems within ""Oz"" are simple to understand and easy to see, yet they create such complex dilemmas for the characters in the real world; technology adds stress and easily controls every aspect of our lives, and 'Summer Wars' does a fantastic job revealing this.

The film won the Japanese Academy Prize for Best Animated Feature Film, and it easily deserves the award: the characters are fresh, the story is exciting, the music is spectacular, the animation boasts a few surprises and new techniques (which, for any true Anime fan, should make it a must-see) and the similarities between the animated Earth and our real one are strikingly real with vivid detail; TV's are different brands, children play with the Nintendo DSi, there is an iPhone, the television channels are real too (this can be seen perfectly on Blu-ray).

Overall 'Summer Wars' is a triumph, better than Hosoda's previous 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time' and many other anime films for that matter. It has all the makings of a classic, and a little something for everyone!

The Blu-ray disc is excellent, great sound/video quality from Funimation. I'm very pleased with it all.",1299542400,2,1252,5.009615384615385

4308921,4,B004AFUJGG,"Anime should always look this good. The funniest part is how the Japanese can't find another villain outside their borders except for the United States of America.. just can't. The family part within is the heart of the movie and it should be applauded for it and the moments without stand above all. Mamorou Oshii rebellion against his country bleeded into absolute Hatred for America and you see it in almost everything he's done, and so too does it effect the ones who follow him. This is why ragheads continue their rage against whatever they've been raggin' against now. That's a shame this movie had to do this and not something new and unique.

4308922,5,B004AFUJGG,"i started off writing a detailed synopsis of the movie but that's pointless...writers with much greater skill have already done so.

really, i just needed to rate the movie and make sure people realize this is quite the addition to their anime (or non-anime) collection of blu-rays.

first off, the movie is very entertaining.  it is well drawn, animation smoothly done...artistically, its unmatched by most full feature length animes from japan.  although i typically cringe from cell-shading, it works well the cyber environment created.  the fight scenes were fast paced and exciting, dynamically different from most other animations where mechas blow up ninjas and high schoolers take on demons.  my complaint here would be that there wasn't enough action...but the time spent on such a unique story made up for that.

characters do grow, but there ALOT of them...in fact, an entire family reunion to keep up with.  overwhelming as it is when you first see all of them, you grow to know each of them if only briefly for some.  comedy and a tragedy, this movie is quite a gem.

the story from what i hear is not as original (something about digimon) as i had hoped, but seeing that the same person wrote both stories, i'm not going to fault him for reusing his own material and create a new product for another audience.  i have no interest in watching digimon ever (tried it, not for me) even though i'm an avid fan of japanese animation.

and you can relate to the movie.  cell phones, laptops, and tvs integrated with the internet all connected to a giant cyberworld that uses avatars to complete transactions, socialize, and conduct business...we already live in that world!  they do this today on secondlife, world of warcraft, etc...but on a much grander scale.  (albeit, the ""having a life"" factor does weigh heavy in our own reality ;)",1298851200,,1846,4.834394904458598

4308925,5,B004AFUJGG,"I cannot recommend this title highly enough. The visuals are stunning, especially in the OZ sequences and equal for the real world. The story, equally as well done, will keep you watching until the very end. The movie is a great adventure for those seeking a thought provoking and fun title to entertain whenever you watch.

4308926,5,B004AFUJGG,"Summer Wars isn't exactly a new theme for anime, or movies in general.  It's the sometimes trite and mostly overused boy meets girl meets problem = awww <3.  That out of the way it is an original it is beautiful and it is a fantastically well done take on a tired theme.  I'm not going to delve into the actual plot, as there are plenty of other reviews that do so...as such please consider this a spoiler free review.

The DVD comes with some small cards of characters you will meet in the anime, a beautiful box, and a second disk of extras, previews, and other bits of information on Summer Wars.  It's a nice way to handle the issue of adding extra content, a separate disc is far preferable to wading through the menus.  The subtitling is done very well and is never obtrusive nor does it move so quickly that you're distracted from actually watching the anime.  That in and of itself is often a difficult task to achieve with subtitles and they should be lauded just for that fact.

The graphics are beautiful and the color palette is massive.  The change between the real world and OZ is a phenomenal example of this as things become brighter, the colors less natural and more deeply hued, and yet it all seems natural as if you could login to OZ today and create your own avatar.  In the real world the saturation and blending is most apparent with the backgrounds, sunsets, sunrises, fields, and cities are richly animated and nothing feels like an afterthought.  It is no wonder that this series won so many awards, just based on the art alone it is an epic achievement.

The story of Summer Wars has more to do with family, cooperation, and faith in your fellow human being than the actual goings on of OZ.  Each character is well developed, though some are more distinct than others.  You can tell that the creators took each individual character very seriously and tackled subjects that may otherwise be difficult to handle.

Your main characters are a painfully shy high school student who has never kissed a girl and is focused on math, a young lady unsure of where she is in the world and desperate to please her grandmother, uncle, and other relatives even if that means lying.  The grandmother is a proud matriarch of a respected but now (comparatively) penniless family who has lived a life of conviction, clearly holding her clan together.  Others include bombastic uncles, snotty aunts, overly inquisitive young children, a quiet loner of a child with a secret revealed halfway through the anime, and an uncle who fills the role of being the titular black sheep.

It's a big cast that would be easy to lose track of if you weren't introduced to them so thoroughly and if they weren't all distinct.  It's a feat that Summer Wars manages to keep everything together so well throughout the entire show.

Summer Wars is a very family oriented anime in that it is based around a family, and the ""family"" of a world connected all the time through OZ (a much evolved Internet).  It reflects that while we may want to solve our problems alone, hide our pain and worries from the world, and share only what makes us seem the best - we can't solve anything that way and we must learn to communicate.  This is a timeless message that still comes across fresh in Summer Wars and is endearing if just for the way it is presented to us.",1298419200,3,3343,4.536666666666667
4308927,5,B004AFUJGG,"What happens when you inject an ingenious artificial intelligent (AI) system into a globally omniscient social and economic network? In the case of SUMMER WARS, you get a poignant and quite possibly prescient cautionary tale.

Mamoru Hosada's animated tale is framed by the extended Jinnouchi clan-- an aristocratic Japanese family-- preparing to celebrate their matriarch's 90th birthday. We enter as great-granddaughter Natsuki invites classmate Kenji Koiso (high school math whiz, antihero protagonist) under the pretense that he's her finance. Given hints of the family's deep civic and professional roots in Japan's military industrial complex and their everyday social networking, a few profound chance events converge into an apocalyptic showdown-- pitting ancient family values against nascent social networks.

It impressively interweaves the kind of endearing humane drama one expects of Studio Ghibli with the fantastically rendered conflicts that emerge from the best Japanese science fiction animation. Unlike most Disney/ Pixar films, the results are wonderfully ambivalent.

-----

What makes the film especially poignant are a handful of recent events. This week nascent, omnipresent social media (Facebook(tm), Twitter) are being credited with helping to foster grassroots uprisings-- in Egypt, Bahrain, Tunisia, Libya, Jordan, Yemen and Morocco-- potentially undermining generations of region-wide autocratic rule. Simultaneously Watson, IBM's artificial intelligent system, effortlessly defeated his human opponents on Jeopardy. Expanding Deep Blue's earlier footsteps.

Are these conjoined systems nefarious precursors to Kubricks's HAL2000, the Matrix's Agent Smith and the Terminator franchise's Skynet or benign one's like Pixar's WALL-E, STAR TREK TNG's Commander Data and Spielberg's David (in A.I.)?

4308931,5,B004AFUJGG,"There have been many excellent reviews written about Summer Wars already, but as a member of a family that does not frequently watch Japanese animation I have an obligation to let people know that this is not a niche film. Summer Wars, like all great animation, succeeds on many levels. It has stunning visuals, an excellent and intriguing story, (that's not hard to follow despite it being largely set in cyberspace) and excellent characters. The story is about a family, but, unlike so many animated films, the family doesn't take a backseat to the story--it IS the story. It's amazing to watch a realistically depicted (although delightfully quirky) family reunion transform into a show of touching family resolve that will ultimately inspire viewers both young and old. I highly recommend Summer Wars to be viewed as a family or, of course, by any lovers of animation.

One last thing I have to add. The Jinnouchi family's matriarch, Sakae, is the true star of this film. She is a character that you will not soon forget. Satoko Okudera, the screenwriter of Summer Wars, manages to bring to Japanese cinema an elderly woman that demands respect for her both her wisdom and her bravery.",1297814400,6,1189,4.8861386138613865
4308932,4,B004AFUJGG,"I love Madhouse.  The Studio has produced some of the best anime to come out of Japan in the last decade, including the recent ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"".  Much of that team re-assembled to put together the ambitious ""Summer Wars"".  The result?

I was entertained and disappointed.  I felt moments of ""wow, that's storytelling"" and stretches of ""that doesn't make sense"".  I was impressed by creative plot twists and turns that ultimately wound up in all-too-familiar territory.

One thing I found was that two dozen one-dimensional characters didn't engage me in the least, but I would have sat and listened to the wisdom and life stories of the family matriarch for hours on end.  Unfortunately, even the main players -- whom I found really interesting, or bold, or mysterious at first -- evolved into stick figure shadows of themselves by the end of the film.

Hosoda's attempt to create a sort of anime version of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is daring, and I admire the effort.  I couldn't escape the film without wanting to ""tweak"" it here and there, to temper its extremes and make its deus-ex-machina moments a little more plausible.  It was as if the writers wanted it to be a slice-of-life fantasy with romantic elements and martial arts combat mixed in with deep historical roots set in a William Gibson-esque landscape -- and the whole thing collapsed under its own weight.

So, I was less impressed by this than other Madhouse productions.  I wanted to really like this film, but instead came away with melancholy feelings of what might-have-been.",1297814400,18,1558,4.900763358778626

It had everything comedy, action, romance, and family standing by each others side.  I also happen to be a huge fan of Brina Palencia so it was a bonus to have her playing the voice of Natsuki.  I will not give away to much of the plot of the movie so i will just say if you enjoy a fun anime with lots of action and amazing story telling this anime is definitely for you.  It ranks up there with my other favorite animes of all time, classics like akira and other less known animes such as Ninja Scroll and any anime with Brina as a voice actress, Beck, School Rumble, ect...",1297814400,3,870,4.167664670658683
4308934,5,B004AFUJGG,"While some reviewers have compared Summer Wars to a Miyazaki type of work, Summer Wars really fills a space between Isao Takahata (Pom Poko, Only Yesterday, My Neighbors the Yamadas) and Satoshi Kon. Summer Wars has the pace and intrigue of Satoshi Kon but melds in a human side similar to Isao Takahata's more slice-of-life type works. The characters are warm and believable, the action fast paced, and you will fret and cheer along with a fantastic crew of characters in a fun to experience world.

The story follows math nerd Kenji into the vibrant and chaotic family life of his classmate Natsuki just as the world goes crazy. A virtual program, OZ (think Facebook + Second Life and raised to the 5th power) which links much of life together, goes haywire because a hacker trying to ruin the world. Kenji and Natusuki's whole clan rush into action to save the day.

Two intriguing themes in the film are (1) how digital life is both blessing and curse and (2) how something as old fashioned as family can never be done without. Both themes are played off each other as in a mix of the old, the new and the enduring in the face of the possibilities we create for ourselves, both good and bad.",1297814400,15,1195,4.553488372093023
4308935,5,B004AFUJGG,"Or is it the other way around?

Reminiscent of American movies like ""War Games,"" as well as anime greats like ""Spirited Away,"" this movie blends suspense, comedy, family, and a touch of romance in an expert mixture that is fun and heartwarming.

Kenji is a math genius with no self-confidence and, in his opinion, nothing else he is good at, especially when it comes to the fairer sex. He is spending his summer break working in tech support for the mega-giant, all pervading social networking site Oz when the girl of his dreams, the popular upperclassmen Natsuki, asks if he can work for her over the summer. The job is simple, she says. He just needs to accompany her on a trip to her Grandmother's house for a family reunion and do whatever odd jobs are needed to help out her big family. When it turns out that the real job is to pretend to be her fianc, he balks at first. After all, he has never even taken a girl on a date, let alone gotten serious enough to be engaged! (My perception is that he was thinking that he can't pretend to be in love with someone that he has loved from afar for years!) But he agrees to go along with the ruse with some gentle pleading by the pretty Natsuki. When an AI cyber-terrorist attacks Oz using Kenji's avatar, most everything hits the fan. But Natsuki's large, eccentric family mobilizes, with inspiration from the matriarch and an extra push from Kenji himself, and works to counter this threat to the world, since much of the real world's infrastructure is routed through Oz, and Oz is being eaten by the AI. Can a math geek, a middle school fighting game expert, and a beautiful, self confident young woman save the world? Watch this masterpiece by Mamoru Hosoda, the director of the stunning ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,"" and find the answer.

The BluRay is well presented, with easy to use menus and stunning graphics. The background art, both in and out of Oz, is breathtaking art in it own right. The character designs in the real world are natural and effective. The Oz avatars are cute, but have amazing capacity for creepiness and emotional expression. The English dub cast, comprised of veteran voice actors like Brina Palencia, Michael Sinternicklaas, Todd Haberkorn, and J. Michael Tatum, do a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life. Many big name anime films use big name actors instead of professional voice actors, and the dubs frequently suffer because of it. ""Summer Wars"" does not fall into that trap. The dub script is well wrought, with extremely natural turns of phrase and an excellent ""lip flap"" match, so much so that it is hard to tell that it isn't the original language of the film. There were a few spots were on-screen kanji were not translated that would have been helpful, but other than that, the localization is extremely well done.

4308939,5,B004AFUJGG,"I'm fortunate to live near an arthouse theater that has been having special screenings of Summer Wars (just got back from seeing it an hour ago, actually). It was shown in Japanese with subtitles, which was great. And I ended up being more than pleasantly surprised by the film, despite the fact that the film quality was dreadful (that had more to do with the theater than the movie). I'm therefore eagerly anticipating this blu-ray release, and highly recommend it (or the DVD version) to all anime connoisseurs. In fact, just two weeks prior I watched Evangelion 2.0 in the same theater, and while I'm a TREMENDOUS Eva otaku, I think SW beats it hands down. The sheer emotion of the characters really comes through in the film, and the interspersed cyber-battles are great fun.

I do have to reiterate something that at least one other reviewer mentioned. The base plot of the movie is suspiciously similar to that of Digimon: The Movie (Digimon: Our War Game in Japan). Not a bad thing, and there's enough that's different about it that you won't think of it while you're watching. But it is eerie...",1296691200,,1104,4.72020725388601
4308940,3,B004AFUJGG,"I saw a preview of it on my new Black Butler DVD, and I plan to buy it when it comes out, but is it just me, or does anyone who saw the preview think the plotline of the movie looks a little too much like one of the old Digimon movies? It's the one where that super digimon virus took over the internet, and the digidestined all teamed up with their digimon to enter digital internet space to stop the virus before it caused worldwide catastrophe while everyone around the digimon universe world with a computer watched the battle online and on tv? *lol*",1296432000,6,554,4.285714285714286
4308941,5,B004AFUJGG,"I'd watched this movie online, and it is one of the best animated movies, that Japan has to offer, next to Studio Ghilbi, Highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves riveting thillers, comedy and sci-fi like action. Can't wait unitl it comes out on blu ray!!!",1296345600,,263,4.617021276595745
8420133,5,B004AFUJGG,"I rarely watch movies unless they've gotten consistently great reviews or are known as timeless classics - I've only watched animated films as a kid, with the exception of a few Pixar movies. This movie took me completely by surprise, threw me onto the couch, and dragged every feeling out of me, the good and bad. I have tried to think of how to explain this movie to someone else, and you simply can not do so. It is in its own league.",1528675200,,437,4.27710843373494
8420134,5,B004AFUJGG,"My favorite non-Ghibli theatrical release. Great artwork, good fight scenes, family values, young love (messy and awkward, like real life), aging, a moral compass and food.",1528329600,,172,5.653846153846154
8420135,5,B004AFUJGG,"This movie is so cute. Highly recommend if you like Miyazaki's movies. Although this one is more grounded in reality, it still has positive messages about family and love.",1527379200,,171,4.931034482758621

8420139,5,B004AFUJGG,"This movie is so much fun. It has heart in spades. It is not nearly as emotionally taxing as Wolf Children or The Girl who Leapt Through Time, but it still has its moments. And its overall message about family packs a punch. And the animation is Ghibli calibre. My personal favorite from Hosoda so far.",1523664000,,302,4.410714285714286
