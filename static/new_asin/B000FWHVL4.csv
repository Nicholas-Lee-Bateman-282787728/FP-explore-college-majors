2592826,4,B000FWHVL4,"'When do we eat?' For years Jews have been asking that same question at the Passover Seder (festive meal), a meal which tends to go on for a very long time, with all its prayers and traditions, the food being just about the last thing on the schedule.

In the family comedy 'When do we eat?', Ira Stuckman (Michael Lerner) tries to hurry things up as much as possible, when he gathers his unique dysfuctional family together for what he declares will be 'the fastest seder', but it turns out to be everything but.

From lesbians to druggies to sex surrogates, this family has it all. The oldest son, is an ex-yuppie, who has now become a Baal Teshuva (a seculer Jew who 'returns' to observant Judaism), a part played perfectly by Max Greenfield.

The script is clever and funny from beggining to end, although some of the sit-commish lines will make you roll your eyes. As the seder moves along, it seems everyone's got dirty laundry to air, and all sorts of bottled up feelings and revelations start surfacing. While some of it is way over the top, the film remains reasonably believable thanks to the actors, who stay within character and play out their parts well. The film manages to be funny without being too outrageous, and meaningful without being too preachy.

Some of the jokes may be too 'inside' for non-Jews to get, and too offensive for Jews to appreciate. As one critic put it 'If this film was not made entirely by Jews, it'd be considered anti-semitic'. Perhaps, but as a Jewish person myself I found it to be stereotypical in the same way that 'My big fat Greek wedding' stereotypes Greeks, but not offensive by any means (atleast not for people who have a sense of humor).

Bottom Line: The Movie is fun, entertaining and heartwarming and should not be taken too seriously.",1161734400,23,1792,4.622641509433962
2592827,2,B000FWHVL4,"A broad range of Jewish-related-topic movies varies from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trembling-Before-G-D/dp/B0000BV1YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trembling Before G-D</a>"" to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Holy-Land/dp/B0001Z3U92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Holy Land</a>"", where Jewish humor, emphasis on the Holocaust and musical inclusions are predominantly accustomed features of.  Of course, modern Israeli cinematograph concentrates more on day-by-day Israeli reality, incorporating  h o h m e s  (sarcastic jokes) if necessary.

Something more linking to a secular modern American reality supposedly depicted in this film does not impress me at all because of a surrealistic mixture of sex-bent traditionally-characteristic  inter-religious-confession-gesheft (profit) pieces of gay-lesbian-adultery-quickie-drug-secular-Hasidic traces of affairs, which is too much for one hour plus story of enjoying their seder continuingly.

Sorry, it is definitely not my cap of tea. If even this play is R-rated.",1160092800,4,1099,7.894308943089431
2592828,4,B000FWHVL4,"You know it's going to be a bad day when you need two boxes of matzah on the night of the first seder. Sure enough, a family's biggest problems come to light during the Passover seder as they try to get through the ""world's fastest Passover seder,"" which turns out anything but. Instead of rock 'n roll, prepare for sex, drugs and zany antics of the Jewish kind.

Ira and Peggy Stuckman (Michael Lerner and Lesley Ann Warren) head the diverse blended family consisting of a son addicted to drugs and Dad thinks he cured him; a yuppie-turned-Hassidic son who won't work with Dad in his Christmas ornament business; a daughter who is a sex therapist and Dad knows it; a daughter who is a lesbian from Ira's first marriage; and an autistic son. Bring together a family like that, and you know it's not going to be an ordinary or speedy seder.

Ira and his father Artur (Jack Klugman) lost most of their family during the Holocaust. Grandpa is still angry with Ira for not going into the family haberdasher business and makes him feel like the least favorite despite of being the only surviving child. Still, Ira urges his Hassidic son to go into the Christmas ornament business.

Out of respect for her recently turned Hassidic son, Peggy hires Rafi, a tough-looking Israeli with an eye patch, to build the tent so the family can hold a seder like the old days complete with pillows and lamb roasting on a spit. Before the seder begins, the drug addict fetches antacid for Dad and adds Ecstasy to give him a different perspective. That's only the beginning of the family's journey as Dad starts seeing things including Moses and starts believing he, like Moses, must lead the family out of darkness into the promised land of acceptance and forgiveness.

Though a spoof-style comedy, the story intertwines humanity and lessons without an overdose of sweetness. The family gathering can easily be seen as a Thanksgiving gathering, a Christmas dinner or any other family get-together where members clash over who they are and what they want others to be.

When Do We Eat? rolls humor, quirkiness, Jewish traditions, inspiration, spirituality and a dysfunctional family into a 90-minute funfest. Don't expect it to be the funniest movie ever. If you're OK with Jewish and drug humor, prepare for a good time as the movie contains plenty of laugh-a-lot moments and plenty of witty and animated dialogue.

Not just for Jewish people, but anyone who has a clue about what a Seder Supper is may enjoy it.  Some of the humor refers to Jewish culture, but some is clever family funny stuff.

Essentially, we have a family of wildly different ""types"" trying to have the traditional family ceremony/supper for Passover, and a lot of unexpected stuff comes up or goes down.  As the guests arrive, we see that the family is so full of extreme types as to be unrealistic, but that is part of what makes it funny.

2592883,3,B000FWHVL4,"Finally, a film (albeit not a great one) about a family through the prism of a seder. Instead of taking the more dramatic choice (""Festen""-style), the director chooses to build a comedy. The Stuckmans, a wealthy secular suburban family, suffer their annual cursory seder in which dysfunctions and resentments bubble up at the table. Not kosher, barely kosher-style. We have the eldest son gone Chabad, the autistic teen, the neglected lesbian daughter from a first marriage, the Israeli contractor, the pothead. Klugman is diminished but still holds power as the traumatised and terrified Holocaust survivor. There are some excellent punch-lines (the response of the newly religious son to the hiloni contractor's Hebrew-language disparagement). There is also a lot of pat pop-psych awkwardly voiced (the father/grandfather issues, the explanation for Stuckman's trade). If you are not observant, you will laugh more often; the actual seder plays a very minor role in structuring the denouement. Don't expect much commentary, and the film could easily be transposed to any other tradition or religious festival meal.

You can bet they play off one another and set off one another just by being in the same room.  Not everything works and there is an attempt to clean up the drug connection issue at the end which is just not believable and seems to have been put in at the demand of the Propriety Police. . .

Overall, however, the movie is delightful. It's a mix of broad comedy, predictable conflict, and some extraordinary bits of truth and pain mixed in.  In that regard, watch the movie if only for Jack Klugman.  He's an old man with a suitcase full of pain, literally and figuratively.  His acting is superb and he transcends what could have been a two-dimensional maudlin part.  Bravo.

Additionally, the technical quality is poor and the format is an incredibly annoying small, narrow screen.

From incest, drug abuse, and adultery, to more complex themes of generational communication, there is something for everyone in this movie.  It is a haunting movie that I wasn't sure I liked at first, but found myself thinking about it days later.  I watched it a second time and will probably have to watch it a third or forth time to finally get it out of my system.

2592892,5,B000FWHVL4,"The movie can be hysterically funny for the Jewish viewer. The music is wonderful. Our chavurah loved it. It also offers some veiled innuendos of Kabbalah. Everything that could go wrong at a seder, in a very exaggerated  way, with a highly disfunctional family, is effectively resolved in the end. It is a feel-good movie.",1222128000,2,323,4.872727272727273
2592893,2,B000FWHVL4,"This film has content that makes it suitable only for those aged over 16 or so.  It is not what I would call a ""family movie"".",1199664000,4,126,3.8461538461538463
2592894,4,B000FWHVL4,"If you're not Jewish (or play one on tv), you may not get the humor and ""inside jokes"" on this DVD.  I daresay that if you're a Jew who's embarrassed by the old traditions, you may not get or like this movie. I loved this movie and laughed all the way through, except, of course, at the poignant parts.

Jack Klugman is a gem in this movie and by far my favorite character. Although we were way too busy to show this at Pesach for our guests, this a movie worth enjoying all year 'round.",1179187200,5,487,4.11578947368421
2592895,5,B000FWHVL4,At first my very conservative Jewish friend felt offended when I showed her the movie.  At the end of the movie she admitted how great it was which is not easy for this girl.  Having been around the 3 jewish roommates in college and being taken to many a passover dinner I thought it was beyond funny.  Throughout the movie the importance of the Sedar is stressed by Grandpa. Grandpa is right.  The characters and their acting really made it seem like you were going to another Sedar.  Watch with someone Jewish for explanation or just watch.  Everyone should go to  a Sedar Dinner!,1176768000,2,582,4.538461538461538
2592896,3,B000FWHVL4,"Indeed, sometimes over the top, and other times below the belt... this film must be destined to be a perennial favorite.  Once in awhile a cliche, or ""oh, I've heard that before"" -- are moments few and lean.  Not always believable, but ever entertaining.  As a Christian I enjoyed it, and as knowing some Jewish people I enjoyed it.  I'm not one to think much of most comedies out there, but this was a real charmer.  Enjoy!!!",1173312000,2,426,4.48051948051948
2592897,5,B000FWHVL4,"This is a wonderful film for a person of ANY faith tradition, especially if you have had to endure ""difficult"" family gatherings...but if you also enjoy Jewish humor, THIS IS IT!  The creative, hilarious, and sometimes tender scenes are surrounded by the story of a ""dysfunctional"" family Seder.

Be sure to watch for a couple of minutes after the end credits begin rolling for a final scene.  Also, don't miss the Rabbis who discuss the different layers of meaning to the film in the ""special features"" section.  Their insights are universal in thought, entertaining, and quite meaningful for anyone.  I watched the film again after viewing the Rabbis' commentary and enjoyed it even more.  The soundtrack is fabulous, which includes the Moshav Band's ""Higher and Higher"" (the placement of the song within the context of the film is genius, and I am still laughing).

The film is extremely well done...a main course of hilarious scenes with side dishes of family dynamics and the true meaning of life.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!  Don't be meshugeh...buy it already!",1168300800,17,1065,5.074712643678161
2592898,4,B000FWHVL4,"It has a ton of individual moments throughout that Jewish viewers will giggle at, or go ""A-Ha!"" and yet the non-Jewish viewers will not feel at all discluded on the fun.

And YET......there are a few uncomfortable and also serious moments of family drama sprinkled throughout this film to prevent the feeling you are watching a farce of an ""Afterschool Special"".  NOT your standard ""stoner-comedy"" flick at all - and Lesley Ann Warren really grounds the film with her always-to-be-counted-on acting chops.",1168300800,9,505,5.146341463414634

The story takes a view of family dynamics - and religion - that is, at times, beyond irreverent. The result is a profounder look at both. There's real empathy here, and real faith, too, but it requires the audience to reach outside its comfort zone to appreciate it.",1497744000,,358,4.523076923076923
