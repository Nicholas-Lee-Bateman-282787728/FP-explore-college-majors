8427753,5,B004F88I3E,One of the funniest Japanese films I have seen. I saw it at a theater shortly after it was released. It's just as funny as I remember.,1431388800,,134,4.0
8427754,5,B004F88I3E,"This is one of my all time favorite movies by the Director of 'Shall We Dance.'  Sumo Do, Sumo Don't uses many of the same actors and the style is similar to Shall We Dance.  The more I watch it, the more funny elements I pick up.  Although this is zoned for Australia, I have an all region code Oppo DVD player, which is AWESOMELY FANTASTIC, and plays everything perfectly!!",1410048000,,375,4.328571428571428
