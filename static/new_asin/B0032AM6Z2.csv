8387368,4,B0032AM6Z2,"As usual, Charlie Rose assembled a distinguished panal of experts to discuss the brain.  This time they concentrated on the social brain.  They talked about various parts of the brain involved in everyday social interaction and what happens when things go wrong with these parts of the brain.  They touched on the subject of violent/agressive behavior.  Short films were shown on social behavior of worms and agressive behavior amoung fruit flies.  They also showed a short film which illustrated the action of mirror neurons in the brain in a chimp.  The chimp's brain was connected to some sort of device which made a snapping and popping sound when the mirror neurons fired.  When the chimp looked at a person putting food in his mouth, the mirror neurons fired continuously.  This was used to show that we actually perform the same actions we see of others physical activity on a subconscious level via our mirror neurons.  Not only are the actions of others registered, but the emotions of others as well.  This is what empathy is all about.  When we see that others are sad, we become sad, when we see that others are hurt we become hurt, etc.  The only exceptions are that sociopaths and other similar people don't experience this.

It was also explained that the superior temporal sulcus responds selectively to biological motion while area V5 which is a junction of neurons along the optic radiation responds to virtually any kind of motion.

This was a very fascinating program!  It should not be missed!",1287705600,7,1514,4.859375
8387369,5,B0032AM6Z2,Charlie Rose is interviewing some of the greatest authorities on the study of the social brain. The panel shows that after millions of years of evolution we have acquired a myriad of adaptations that have allowed us to create the society we now have. Yes the social brain is complex but you will find it to be thrilling listening to the experts put the pieces of the puzzle together for us. This is the most exciting and informative viewing than I have seen in a long time. See it!,1274918400,3,481,4.415730337078652
8387370,3,B0032AM6Z2,"Having enjoyed episode 5 on the developing brain, I thought this one on the social brain would be useful as well. However, these presenters - on mirror neurons(very good), on social information being genetic as proven in other species (good), on autism, a disorder in social ability, on aggression in fruit flies - seemed to skip around without a central unifying theme - like looking at a broken mirror, wondering how the pieces are supposed to fit together. I would have liked more application to human behavior, for instance attachment, which is a major player in the underpinning of human (and probably all mammal) social behavior is not mentioned. I now know more about the social behavior of worms and fruit flies but I was looking for more information on human brains.",1272758400,4,775,4.878787878787879
