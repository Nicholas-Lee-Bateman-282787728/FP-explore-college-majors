I remember the TV ads that made these look like they were nature documentaries and hid the fact they were trophy-hunting travelogues. I went with a group of animal-loving girls my age as part of a birthday party - at 7 years old - to see this movie. ...You can imagine the trauma that ensued. After seeing all these gorgeous deer and sheep shot dead and their bodies dragged around by trophy hunters, BAMBI was a walk in the park.

I will never forgive them for selling this to the public as a ""True-Life Adventure for the Entire Family!"" (quote from the movie poster, showing animals but no hunters or guns)",1502064000,,688,4.417322834645669
8674325,5,B00MRCRCRI,"I was familiar with the film at the time of its first release through the theatres in 1972 and am happy to say it is just as enjoyable today. Primarily a photo essay of an outdoorsman's hunting exploits, the scenery is beautiful, the wildlife captivating!",1484956800,,255,4.688888888888889
