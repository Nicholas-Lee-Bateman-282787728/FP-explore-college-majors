8193783,1,B000PY314S,I knew when I bought this movie what type of movie I was getting.  Sorry to say it was horribly shot.  Most of the scenes were shot at a 45 degree angle so the actress was angled across your screen.  It was impossible to enjoy.  Buy at your own risk it was not worth the time it took to fast forward through.,1267315200,2,308,3.9193548387096775
