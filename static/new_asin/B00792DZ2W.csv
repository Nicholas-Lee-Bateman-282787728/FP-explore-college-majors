5063785,5,B00792DZ2W,This movie was great.  Very believable and the phoenix background is neat.  Especially their new tram.  I'd like to see more movies by this writer/director/producer (David Dilley).,1418428800,,180,5.592592592592593
5063786,5,B00792DZ2W,I have always been into mafia/gangster films since I first watch the Godfather when I was just a kid. I was really surprised when I watched Suspicion. The story is very intense and you never find yourself uninterested. It's just one of those films that keeps your attention going from the beginning to the end. You really care about the characters. I would recommend it to any film buff you won't be disappointed!,1399161600,,413,4.671232876712328
5063787,5,B00792DZ2W,"Was blown away by Brad Blaisdell's performance.  The man can act!  Suspicion is a compelling indie thriller, which keeps you guessing until the end.  The writing and direction is excellent.  I'm sure we'll see more from this director soon.

I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story driven film.",1360972800,,337,4.842105263157895
5063788,4,B00792DZ2W,"Before I purchase any movie I try to obtain reviews and watch trailers etc.  Wow!  The Trailer for this movie knocked my socks off!  For a low budget film, I found the story line very interesting!  The movie had a few twists to it that really surprised me---for a person that usually can figure out how the endings are going to be.  Suspicion is definitely a movie purchase that I was not disappointed or felt like that I wasted my money.  I would like to see more movies like this one!",1346976000,,486,4.285714285714286
5063789,5,B00792DZ2W,"This is a little Indie film that got some notice at some festivals. As such, I settled in for a boring journey to the land of transcendentalism. Boy was I wrong! This movie didn't waste my time at all. There was always something meaningful going on. I've watched it a couple of times and so far I pick out at least one new thing each time.

Can you imagine the police thinking you are withholding some damaging testimony, based on some kind of relationship you had with someone, but you genuinely aren't withholding anything? That's how we meet the main character (Suzanne May) - in an interrogation room, being grilled about someone she knew (Brad Blaisdell) that was just murdered. As the movie goes on, we find out just how much she knows (and more importantly, what she doesn't, but really should). I can't get into too much detail without giving away the story, but this movie has a great twist that is well worth watching for.

The director (David Dilley) does a great job of maintaining a sense of urgency throughout the movie, without forsaking the relationship building that goes on between the characters. There was always something central to the story going on. The ending definitely leaves a feeling that the main character's life is forever changed by putting an underworld shadow over her that only she and the underworld (and us, of course!) know about, but one which the rest of the world will never have even the slightest suspicion.

If you have time for a movie, I strongly suggest that this movie is worth that time.",1336435200,3,1537,4.685185185185185
5063790,4,B00792DZ2W,"Alicia (Suzanne May) is a college student studying law. She works at a cafe counter where she meets the kindly old Darrell Jacobs (Brad Blaisdell). They forge a platonic relationship. But as it turns out, Darrell was a mafia type, but now has stage IV cancer without much time left. Tom (Aidan Bristow) is Alicia's boyfriend who doesn't want Alicia to hang out with Darrell. As someone going into law, Alicia is fascinated by Darrell's criminal past, which he hesitates to share.

Darrell is murdered at the beginning of the film. Alicia is telling the story (including private conversations when she wasn't there) to a detective played rather poorly by Kathleen Benner. Things in the story are not what they seem. Our suspicions are raised early as the mystery drama plays out before us. The drama was interesting enough to draw you it, but it didn't have a knock-out punch. Decent acting. Worth a view when it comes on TV.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1335571200,2,952,4.763636363636364

5063794,2,B00792DZ2W,"There is some good in this movie and some potential, but it has major problem beyond the usual lack of production values caused by not having enough money.  Most importantly, it plays like Blaisdell has only seen Mafia movies.  It's not good enough that he knows how little he knows and make excuses for not knowing more (the old guy saying how did you think we talk?).  The right answer is this problem is to make movies about something you know more about, or, if Blaisdell knows more, be more honest about.
  The dialogue is hackneyed too.  This answer is the same to this problem.  If he has experienced a dying parent and betrayal, Blaisdell should work through this material more directly and honestly.  If not, it is probably better for him to stay closer to his own life experiences, at least to start with.
  The problem might have been that doing so would have meant no financial backing and no movie.",1448582400,,911,4.567901234567901

5063797,3,B00792DZ2W,"I believe anyone who gave this film 5 stars is in some way affiliated with the film (there have been only 10 reviewers so far so this is quite plausible).  The acting by the two leads was surprisingly good (which got it an extra star) but the story moved slowly and never made me buckle my seat belt.  So the guy's got a few weeks to live, is coughing up blood all the time due to lung cancer but he's going on a vigorous hike up a steep incline and he's helping the 23 year old lady?  seriously?  And I didn't buy his dropping his emotional veil toward the end (on top of the mountain)... the director took that way too far.  Cancer guy just pops out of nowhere to save waitress' life and she doesn't even ask him what he was doing there?  Really?  Just some nitpicks.",1447718400,,769,4.155405405405405

5063799,5,B00792DZ2W,"This movie an eccentric treat, with beautiful Suzanne Mays and Brad Blaisdell as a completely believable ""retired"" mobster who befriends Mays' character and all sorts of unexpected occurrences proceed from that friendship. It starts as a murder in the past, and makes its way back to the present, as the waitress and ex-mobster tread a dangerous path together.",1444867200,,360,5.224137931034483
