1908509,4,B0000APVIX,"An engaging yet occasionally prosaic anime. Witch Hunter Robin isn't nearly as captivating as the Twelve Kingdoms, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The show really picks up after the first 12 episodes and becomes far more entertaining than it was during the earlier installments!",1065398400,,276,5.295454545454546
1908510,4,B0000APVIX,"The artwork, style and characters are first-rate (not to mention a remarkable soundtrack). Its a great series, the characters are well thought out and each is different enough to add the interpersonal interest long running series need between it's characters. The first 10 episodes are not really related to the main story, they are more like separate x-files style episodes used to introduce you to all the characters before the main story kicks in around episode 10, this isn't to say the first 10 episodes aren't interesting.. they're a great deal better than your typical x-file episode (but then what isn't with the way that show went downhill).
Charles Solomon's covers the basics in his description above pretty well, if you can mentally remove the pompous remarks. Does this guy even like anime? (Check some of his other reviews on other anime series for sale at Amazon to see what I mean).",1064016000,10,898,4.9144736842105265
1908511,5,B0000APVIX,"Witch Hunter Robin is probably one of the best Anime I've seen yet. I'm usually a tradition oldschool Anime kind of guy. I'm also a picky b*stard. I was always a Bubblegum Crisis, Dangaioh, Megazone 23 kind of guy. It was probably the great music in them. Even though the music in Anime today isn't as rememberable as some oldschool Anime, the story lines are way great. Well there are exceptions, and Witch Hunter Robin had some great music. Remember guys, Witch Hunter Robin was by the makers of Cowboy Bebop, and you probably will be expecting a lot out of it. Don't expect too much, because Cowboy Bebop was the best (1998). But still, even when my expectations were high, Witch Hunter Robin was still great and overall quality, and it deserves five stars. The dialogue and everything is detailed. Beautiful animation, Well it was made in 2002 :) If you're the type that likes to discover new Anime and like taking risks to buy Anime that you've never seen and hope to love, this is the right one. Telling you this kind of defeats the purpose of taking risks. :P Well yeah, it's awesome, again music is awesome, and characters are cool. This release is l33t!",1062374400,15,1162,4.591346153846154
1908512,5,B0000APVIX,"Sometimes everything can come together when crafting a good anime.  It has happened again with Witch Hunter Robin.  This is definitely not your fan boy's anime.  You won't find any beauty contests, beach episodes, goofy pets, or other lighter anime standards.  What we do find here; is a solid storyline, beautifully drawn, well animated scenes, excellent music, and interesting characters.
It's difficult to create the dark tone of an anime, without looking like its been forced.  There is seriousness to the story, that's rarely seen in an animated show.  In fact, it may be a small flaw, that it lacks sufficient comedy relief.  The first few episodes, play like something out of early X-Files.  Its important to stay tuned. As the show starts to heat up, it becomes a ""must have more episodes now"", by about mid-series.  One word of warning, for buying later episodes, you may want to wait till they are all obtainable.  You may not be able to stand the wait, for the final chapters.
On the story itself, it unfolds as characters are developed working within the context.  This is not one of those series that wastes time doing mind-numbing introductions.  The characters, and their roles become apparent, as the story plays out.  This is the best way to learn about them, because it keeps the viewer involved, and does not pander to overly casual viewers.
The full series of Witch Hunter Robin spans 26 episodes, and does a nice job of completing the story. That is significant, as many anime designed for multiple seasons, have very poor endings.  It appears this series was designed to start, and reach completion, within the 26 episodes made.  I cannot speak for the dubbing, but the voice work on the Japanese track is quite excellent.  Hopefully the dub will be just as good.",1059782400,42,1785,4.822368421052632
1908513,4,B0000APVIX,"The anime ""Witch Hunter Robin"" is the story of the STN-J team that protects citizens from the threat of modern day witches (a term that includes both genders).  The goal is to track individuals who have the witch gene in their ancestry and take care of them before their latent abilities emerge and they harm the general population.  In Volume 1 (""Arrival""), Robin Sena, a 15-year-old girl born in Japan but raised in a convent in Italy, arrives back home in Japan to be the team's new witch hunter, replacing a member who had been killed in the line of duty.  Robin is a ""craft-user,"" who has the ability to create and manipulate flame (just not very well at first).  She is also reserved and cautious, except when it comes to dealing with Amon, the team leader.  He is ten years older so it is hard to tell early on if he is just going to remain her mentor or if there might be more in store (go ahead, take a wild guess).

Other teenagers on the team are Miho Karasuma, a craft-user who can pick up information and impressions from objects and people, Haruto Sakaki, is quick to spring into action but usually gets hurt and causes a lot of damage, Michael Lee, the group's resident computer hacker, and Yurika Dojima, whose only talent appears to be showing up late for work.  Chief Kosaka shows up and yells a lot as he runs the group's daily operations while Takuma Zaizen is the administrator for all STN operations in Japan and has introduced a substance called ""orbo"" to the team's operations.  Orbo amulets and guns help the team resist the effects of craft against them in the field.

The DVD follows Robin and STN-J as they hunt down witches in the first four of the series 26 episodes: (1) ""Replacement"" has Robin joining the STN-J team, but on the first mission the other members of the team do not know that she is their new witch hunter; (2) ""Addicted to Power"" begins with the witch Kazuya Misawa on trial for murdering his business partner, but even though the police have tampered with the evidence it is doubtful he will be convicted, which means STN-J has to stop him before he can kill again; (3) ""Dancing in Darkness"" begins with the STN-J investigating a dried corpse where Robin finds a dead insect and the hunt is on for a witch who can control insects, but then it turns out the murder of witches goes back for centuries, which suggests something else might be at work; and (4) ""Stubborn Aesthetics"" begins with Amon giving Robin the file for a series of murder cases that may or may not be related but might involve a witch.  Robin and Miho investigate the case together.  (5) ""Smells Like the Wandering Spirit"" finds the STN-J searching a shanty town for a potential witch.  When one of the homeless men runs from Sakaki he gives chase only to watch as the terrified man runs into traffic and is killed.  An autopsy reveals the man was not a witch and it looks like the witch they are searching for might be able to control minds.

These first five episodes are laying the foundation for what is to come (accidents that are not accidents are key in the next several episodes).  Witches are obviously bad, but the distinction between the hunted and the hunters seems rather suspect.  Are we talking about the difference between good witches and bad witches or is there more going on here?  Early on Robin is learning the ropes as well as getting used to her teenage teammates.  Things are starting to come together slowly and given I trust the recommendations of those who urged me to check out this particular anime I am focusing on key interpersonal elements and other hints that suggest what might be coming down the road for Witch Hunter Robin and her teammates.  The animation is above average but it is really character more than pictures which are carrying this anime.",1114992000,3,3802,4.556534508076358
1908514,5,B0000APVIX,"What initially drew me to this series was the name Witch Hunter Robin, but then when I learned that it came from the same brilliant creators that brought us Cowboy Bebop I knew this was something I had to check out without quite knowing what I was getting myself into. Watching 'Arrival' through for the first time left me feeling a bit disappointed as the look and feel were completely different from Cowboy Bebop but now I greatly appreciate that. In the beginning I felt that the characters had no emotion and that the episodes were all so redundant and predictable but after viewing them a few more times I've come to think otherwise. Indeed, the storylines are not that complex and they do move a little slow but, rest assured, they become more interesting as the series moves on. The premise of vol. 1 is basically introducing all the characters and how they interact with one another. There's the aloof Amon (the team's most experienced member); Michael Lee (the chief hacker); Dojima (the spoiled daughter of a rich family who's always fashionably late); Haruto and Karasuma (a rookie and a physic by touch); and of course Robin Sena who is a young 15-year-old craft user sent in as a replacement six months after losing one of their own. They are all part of the STNJ: a secret organization who hunt and capture witches without killing them. They are then sent off to the factory once hit with special bullets that cause the witches to lose the strength of their powers. And what happens to them there is later revealed...

On vol. 1 we deal with a witch who reportedly cursed his victim to death without ever laying a finger on him...A witch who absorbs the life energy of other witches, or descendants of witches, to remain eternally young...An artist who kills those who get between them and what they happen to be painting at the time...And a witch that seeps into people's minds, implementing them with terror and bringing those feelings to a boil so they become more susceptible to their powers.

This is a great show with wonderful animation, a simple yet intricate plot (meaning you do need to remain attentive to follow along but it doesn't require too much thinking), and a supernatural flair to it all. However, don't expect to be scared out of your wits here. It's more in the vein of X-Files, as many have compared this to before, and understandably so. It's actually a suspenseful drama that relies on some spooky atmosphere, and its subtle approach works very well. Also, the English voices are dead on which only adds to the enjoyment. You may even recognize some voices, such as Karasuma (Faye from Cowboy Bebop) and Amon (Alucard from Hellsing), but as I sit here listening to them talk I don't invision them as their prior characters because their voices fit in with the personalities here on WHR perfectly. Another aspect to this show I really like is how Robin, who has the ability to start fires, is not without flaws. Her eyesight, for instance, is slightly off and she needs glasses so she can hit her targets with more precision ^_^.

It's far more expensive but I recommend buying this limited edition box of collectables if you can. Included with this DVD is the soundtrack, which is $45 alone, along with a T-Shirt, shot glass, and pictures.",1102550400,5,3278,4.697391304347826
1908515,4,B0000APVIX,"""Witch Hunter Robin"" is an animation that many are quick to compare to other series, both animation and live action.  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""La Femme Nikita,"" ""Vampire Princess Miyu"" etc...It is clearly tapping into a current zeitgeist of dark fantasy with a young female lead.  Both the story, tone and visual style are reminiscent of many other works, from the long black clothing and the melancholy faces to the outcast, somewhat-innocent young girl who uses dark power to battle evil. Death is her gift.

With this in mind, the question becomes one not of how good the show is, but how does it succeed within the genre?  Judging from the first episode, it succeeds quite well.  While all of the elements are familiar, it is not a storyline that is so played out that a new, stylistic variation is not welcome.  Robin herself is visually interesting, and her back story of a young life in a convent gives her some flair.  Add to that her lack of control over her own power, and the classic tale of a stranger in a strange land unfolds.

This first DVD is definitely enough to hook me into the series, and want to see how things play out.  AS is typical of Japanese drama, everything is not handed to you at once, and you have to have some patience while the atmosphere builds and the story unfolds.",1095724800,5,1307,4.551282051282051
1908516,4,B0000APVIX,"Witch Hunter Robin (it's so cute the way the Japanese voice actress pronounces 'Robin').  For some reason, I can't get out of my head the French pronunciation, Ro-BAHN.  This character, however her name is pronounced, is such a refreshing change from the typical fifteen year-old heroine of Japanese anime.  Robin Sena has left a nunnery in Rome to join with STN-J, a secret Japanese police agency that fights witches. She has been brought to replace someone who was killed - we do not find out on this volume who they were or how they died.

Robin is very natural and believable.  No huge bishoujo eyes, short skirts, and long hair; Robin has a somber, Puritan-like black dress and a quirky hairstyle.  There are hints she will probably develop a romantic interest in a fellow officer: hey, it's anime - this nun thing can't be carried for too long!  But you hope she will stay the special person she is and will not change too much.

In volume one, Robin arrives but is ostracized by Amon, the unofficial leader of the STN-J agents.  She quietly and determinedly seeks to prove herself.  A place of refuge for Robin is Harry's, a lovely restaurant run by the sympathetic yet mysterious Harry.  No other customers ever seem to be in Harry's.  Who is Harry?

In Volume One, the agents fight four witches - all male except for one.  This is interesting, as ""witch"" connotes a woman.  There are four episodes: 1. Replacement, 2. Addicted to Power, 3. Dancing in Darkness, and 4. Stubborn Aesthetics.

The music on the intro is fantastic.  The animation is exceptional, one of the best I've seen in anime. Interestingly, the Sci-Fi Channel, which brought us the series Stargate, is producing a live action version of Witch Hunter Robin.  It will air sometime in 2004 or 2005.",1095638400,10,1772,4.716612377850163
1908517,4,B0000APVIX,"""A cross between 'La Femme Nikita' and 'The X Files'"", as another reviewer put it. 4 stars, worth the price of admission.

Well, now that we've gotten the ""synopsis"" and the ""conclusion"" out of the way, read on to see why I feel that way, and why I've titled this review 'striptease'.

A long time ago, after the Dinosaurs but before TV, there was something called ""Burlesque"".  One of the more earthy components of a good burlesque show was the Strip Tease.  A woman would come out, fully clothed, and strip to next to nothing.  Look for References to Gypsy Rose Lee, who brought this form of entertainment to an art.

What we have here is an intellectual strip tease.  DVD #1 starts with our world ""fully clothed"", and the music begins to play.  We see the dancer's moves.  Ah, but we know more is comming, don't we (yeah, I've read the other reviews)?

Things that I liked:

THE CHARACTERS:  quirky, without being too over the top.  Robin shows more composure than I would expect a normal 15 year old to have, but then again she was raised by Italian Roman Catholic Nuns.  Anyone who's ever been to parochial school will tell you that even six hours a day with these ""brides of Christ"" was a special hell (bitter? who, me?).  Is Robin all *she* seems to be?

THE ART: a very interesting combination of CG and cel animation. Most interior shots are CG ""backgrounds"", as well as some external shots (Harry's Bar).  Animation is very well done and sytlish.

THE LOOK: Bounces around between Art Nouveau, ""2 Ton Gothic"", and indeterminate modern.  Hey, *I* like it.

THE WORLD: 'Day After Tomorrow' Sci Fi.  The agents wander around with PDA's that I would kill for.  Nobody uses CRT's any more.  Witchcraft exists but is suppressed to the point where the Normal Human Beings are convinced it's tabloid stuff.

THE EXTRAS: The usual stuff, including a glossary of the magical ""tools"" used.  As another reviewer mentions, the series seems to be well researched.

THE STORY: Episodic in volume 1, with a hint or two of the ""larger world"" dropped in each story.  By the end of Volume 1 you are left with several questions: is Robin a spy; why does the Japanese branch capture witches, and what do they do with them; Harry the bartender seems to be more than he appears. etc, etc.  Nice set up.

Ah, good anime at it's finest: the first 4 or 5 epsiodes get you to the top of the hill in the roller coaster.  The Big Drop has to come soon. I can't wait for Volume 2.",1092009600,9,2460,4.487584650112867
1908518,5,B0000APVIX,"Many who watched only the 1st DVD might think that this series is slow and have several disjointed stories for each episode...

 But keep watching, and u'll realise each episode servers a purpose.... usually to build up the character.

 From episode 9 onwards, the story picks up a different pace and swings to an ending that is quite frustrating for some, but perfect IMO.

 I hope they do not make a WHR2. Coz I think they way it ended is ""just nice"".

 Good music, awesome artwork (look at the detail and style...), good story. What else can you ask for?

 It's my all time favourite anime (I'lll even rank it above Bebop)

 Children/minors might have some problems catching the whole theme and story arc though.",1090972800,3,715,4.632
1908519,4,B0000APVIX,"This series is a very well done series that chronicles the exploits of Robin Sena, a 15 year old Witch Hunter who happens to be a Witch.  The premise is a typical one in cinema-the hunter becoming the hunted but in this DVD it is more about getting to know the main characters and watching Robin grow within her powers.  The first DVD features the first 5 episodes and the following can be said of these episodes-well done.  The art is tremendous and the stories equally so.  The whole backdrop is Modern Salem Witch Hunts in Japan, so all the episodes are fairly dark in scope with good voice acting both in English and Japanese.  The stories initially focus on how Robin integrates with the STNJ-a Japanese government agency that specializes in hunting down witches-and her partner Amon.  If you enjoy supernatural anime then this is right up your alley.  It is well crafted both in story and presentation and is easily enjoyed with just enough plot twists to make you think.  The special features on the DVD are also a nice touch as they include character profiles and an overview of some of the ""magic"" elements used in the first 5 episodes.  The whole package is a great start to a good series.  I recommend this DVD and the series as a whole-enjoy!",1085443200,3,1254,4.558035714285714
1908520,5,B0000APVIX,"It actually took me a little while (6 or so eps) to get into this series. It has a slow sense of the dramatic, that doesn't exactly throw you into the action. Instead it takes its time, building character, plot and emotion. All the characters are well thought out, and the series shows who they are, not with silly backstories, but by actually making their personalities distinct and different. At the end of the series I knew a lot about Amon, for instance, but I never had to be shown any flashbacks to know this.
The ending is typically japanese, in that they like to leave things slightly up in the air. The story itself is resolved, but it doesn't tell you much more beyond that. This isn't a bad thing, and allows the viewer to believe what they will.
All in all, I found Witch Hunter Robin to be a very enjoyable experience.",1084579200,,831,4.402597402597403
1908521,5,B0000APVIX,"If you are like me and miss ""X-Files"", you will love this.  The animation is terrific.  The characters are memorable.  Lots of good action.  One of the series that got me to start liking anime.  What's not to like?",1080518400,,214,4.384615384615385
1908522,5,B0000APVIX,"Robin, a young girl, has just been transferred to Japan, to join the teams of the STNJ, a branch of a international organization that finds and combats witches with technology, super-powers and old fashion guts.
The DVD has five episodes, totalling about 125 minutes, lots of extras and even cool menus.  The story is calm, powerful and dark with great artwork, perfect music and computer graphics, like Noir and Cowboy Bebop kind of mixed together with a touch of Ghost In The Shell.
With such great voices as Kari Wahlgren as Robin, frankly a perfect fit, Crispin Freeman as Amon and Wendee Lee as Miho Karasuma you get a great English dub as well as great 3D graphics and natural looking characters.  It all fits together and makes for a great start to a series I plan to buy up to the last DVD!",1079827200,,798,4.534722222222222
1908523,5,B0000APVIX,"another reviewer used the best words to describe this series: Minimalism. A drama done in a very different light. I personally was glad we had 11 episodes of X-file case styles--I love the setting it sets up. I like that the characters are uncomfortable with each other, unsure of each other, stilted in their conversations. These are a group of extraordinary young people selected to hunt the supernatural, not the Young and the Restless.
The series does an excellent job of not rushing the plot, and of making us slowly care about the characters even as the characters slowly care about each other. There are great subtle moments, as the heroes and villains are turned on end until its hard to tell where good and evil begin and end, which is real life.",1079654400,,755,4.684210526315789
1908524,5,B0000APVIX,"Witch Hunter Robin is one of my favorite anime's because it combines to different types of genres. Sci-fi and mystery.

I mean god! This box has a lot of stuff and it's really worth it especially cause you get the soundtrack for the show and the music is beautiful.

1908525,4,B0000APVIX,"It is the beggining of a 26 episode run for this cult hit animation series from Japan and brought to use by Sunrise and Bandi Entertainment.
Unlike most Japanese anime these DVD's are not all shoot'em up or action but tell a particular story. It is not until after episode ten that things start hopping.
Currently being aired on Cartoon Networks Adult Swim in March 2004 it is well worth getting the DVD's just for the extras which include beatifuly rendered cells of Robin herself in each DVD.

1908526,4,B0000APVIX,"Witch Hunter Robin is probably one of the most fascinating anime I've watched in a while. The storyline is unique, very mysterious, and overall highly confusing and complicated. Such a plot, though ultimately becomes this series' flaw. The main character Robin I like very much, but the rest of the cast I'm not so fond of. Many of the characters stay very much undeveloped, and at the end of the series, you'll feel as if more mysteries had been presented than solved. The dialogue in many of the episodes don't reveal much, and often the development of the plot is obscured.",1077753600,,576,4.712871287128713
1908527,4,B0000APVIX,"Seems like series upon series appear on the anime landscape with the ""Special Forces Hunting (Insert Evil Character Type Here)"" premise. ""Hellsing"" and ""Vampire Hunter D"" specialized in vampires, ""S-cry-ed"" focused on mutants; ""Witch Hunter Robin"" makes a commendable effort to follow in the vein of these series, but falls just short.
The basic premise follows STN-J, the Japanese branch of an international witch-hunting organization; theirs is the only branch that captures, instead of kills, the witches, a point whose importance becomes more obvious as the series goes on. The group tracks X-Files-type, strange cases from the police database, and checks if any of the involved has a witch in his/her genealogical line. The group is armed with Orbo bullets and amulets, Orbo being a green liquid that somehow neutralizes witches' powers.
Enter Robin Sana, a teenager from the European sect of STN, sent as a replacement for a recently lost member of STN-J. Team members, particularly the shady leader Amon, are uneasy as Robin exhibits powerful, but raw use of witchcraft, particularly the use of fire, to control their targets.
The series is beautifully shot and animated--clean, quick, smooth animation with CGI used sparingly but effectively. Each character is portrayed well enough, with Robin's naivete and innocence captured perfectly. But looks aren't everything. The first half of the 26-episode series drags along with episode after unconnected episode of STN-J chasing down witch after witch. Few of their targets, if any, really cause problems for the team; Robin's skill, polished by Amon, is much too strong for the ""criminal"" witches.
Like most 26-episode series, ""Witch Hunter"" kicks into gear about midway, around the 13th-15th episode. The storylines from episode to episode begin to tie in to each other, and the line between villain and civilian begins to blur. STN-J begins to struggle internally, building to a climactic last few episodes that revolve heavily and importantly on Robin's past.
""Witch Hunter"" finds itself just a few steps from being truly excellent; had the creators been able to sustain interest in the first half of the series as they did in the second half, it may have been so. Even the second half has a double-edged sword: most of the fun involved figuring out who's loyal to who, who's chasing who, and why...which can also be an overwhelming task.
This first volume will surprise you with its cool, depressingly gothic look, but the pace and repetitiveness hinders true enjoyment. If you have the patience to wait the series out, and if you want to collect a solid series, this one's for you. If you want a keeper that's quickly rewarding, you might want to pass.",1076544000,16,2713,5.126410835214447
1908528,4,B0000APVIX,"I have a 'sweet tooth' for dark fantasy, but the truth is that much of what comes out today, both anime and film, is repetitious.  At some point you have to start being choosy.  Because of that, I've stayed away from this series, despite early critical interest.  But interest has remained positive and curiosity made me decide to pick up the first DVD.  Which always bodes ill for the condition of my wallet.  Fortunately, Witch Hunter Robin turns out much more interesting than I originally expected.
Robin was born in Japan, but as raised in an Italian monastery.  There is some implication that she is actually a nun, but what she actually is is a hunter of witches and a practitioner of the Craft herself.  Her return to Japan to replace a member of a witch hunting team (the STNJ) who died in action ruffles many feathers in a group that can only be described as idiosyncratic.
Amon is the team lead - cold, withdrawn, and not very happy with Robin.  Miho Karasuma is a psychic who can only sense feelings.  Michael Lee is a hacker - caught in the act he volunteered his services to the team.  Haruto Sakaki is another new member who tends to go off half-cocked.  Yurika Dojima is young, rich, and very self-involved.  The 'adults' are Chief Kosaka, whos is everyone's worst nightmare as a boss, and Zaizen, the top man in Japan, and one who seems to have an agenda of his own.  Robin herself can control fire, but not very well.
In this DVD the 'witches' being hunted are not pleasant people.  These are people that use their powers to satisfy their own ends and take pleasure from the pain they cause.  But the STNJ folks only differ from them in intent and name.  As director Shuko Murase remarks in an interview, these are really just opposing sides in a deeper conflict.  In the interactions of the characters one can already see the beginnings of some blurring of the boundaries.
The episodes so far focus on the interpersonal level, acquainting the viewer with the individual characters and the politics of the STNJ unit.  These are complex, and so far balance the action perfectly.  Production quality is excellent, with a finely rendered gothic atmosphere that manages to avoid seeming out of place in modern Japan.  Camera angles and graphic effects are good as well.  It's too early to give the series a hearty recommendation, but it certainly isn't a replay of old themes -  definitely worth a look.",1071360000,9,2417,4.650943396226415
1908529,3,B0000APVIX,"Okay series.  Great intro and ending song.  Drawing is very nice but the plot is definately taking it's time.  I can see which direction plot might go.  Probably won't buy the next dvd's coming out for this one.  I'll just wait til the bootleg with the english dubbing comes out.. and even then I'll only buy the bootleg if it has good plot reviews... but so far, I'm not interested enough.",1070323200,4,390,4.436619718309859
1908530,4,B0000APVIX,"The series is set in modern-day Japan, where there's been an increase in the witch population. An international organization called the STN has been monitoring witchcraft for years, maintaining an extensive database of known witches, their descendants and their various types of powers. When a witch poses a threat to humanity, it's eliminated. The Japanese branch is a bit of a maverick -- they don't kill witches; they neuter their powers and keep them alive.
Robin is a young witch with pyrokinetic abilities. She can start fires without blinking, but she needs a little work on her control. Headquarters sends her to Japan as a replacement agent, and she spends the five episodes on this disc going through the typical trials of the new kid on the block: making connections and gaining trust.
The mysteries in individual episodes are interesting, if a little easy to solve. There are plenty of questions for the series to answer but little hint where an overarching story, such as why there are suddenly more witches, might go. It's worth it, though, just to see how the characters' backstories will unfold.
DVD extras include a deeper look at the runes and symbols witches in the episode use. It's obvious the writers have done a lot of research into magic around the world to give the series authenticity",1069286400,4,1310,4.905405405405405

That's all I could think, watching this. It's not bad, mind you; but the dialouge needs a bit of sandpaper to smooth it out. It seems firmly targeted at fans of those two series.
And I'm sorry, but the opening scene is kind of funny. It's not supposed to be, but please. You can't make up a broody character just to have a broody character because they're popular with girls; you actually have to want a broody character in the show. So, the whole ""I'm so dark and mysterious"" bit that goes over well in some TV shows... falls a little flat when it looks this calculated. The whole show looked a little calculated to me.
Anyways, I kind of liked it, when I could get into it. Good animation, standard premise, not-so-hot dialouge. A bit slow and I think they were trying to make it that way, but they don't cary it off as smoothly as you ought when you're going for that feeling.
All in all I think it could get better but right now it seems a bit too pre-packaged to succeed. Who knows, maybe this will break anime into the main in America the way more unique, difficult and well-made shows couldn't. I generaly watch anime because it's not the same as American shows; but most people like the familiar more than the new and strange, have to be eased into it a bit more. Maybe this will be something like a bridge for more of the TV-watching population. There arn't any of the really challenging concepts in this one, the way there are in a lot of other anime.
All in all, it's not bad.",1068076800,11,1537,4.321799307958478

1908533,5,B0000APVIX,"Let me just say... I expected this series to be bad - REALLY bad.  My friend, however, forced (yes, it's true - forced) me to watch the first five episodes.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This series uses a unique combination of digital graphics and hand-drawn animation (at certain times, the combination is overly obvious).  I would definitely recommend this DVD.
Oh!  And for anyone who watches ""Trigun"": The man who does Vash's voice in the dubbed version also does the voice of one of the characters!",1066521600,,504,4.813953488372093
1908534,5,B0000APVIX,"I first saw this anime at a convention held in Toronto and I immediately fell in love with it. The characters each have distinct personalities and are very well developed. The artwork is superb. The story and plot are completely original and are drawn out in such a way to always keep the viewer interested, especially in the later episodes. Witch Hunter Robin is by far my favourite anime and I highly recommend it to those looking for a unique and dramatic new series.",1065744000,,470,4.607142857142857

As for the limited edition, it's amazing, it contains too many extras and looks cool, a great deal for every collector.
I haven't finished the series yet, but so far it's interesting, and I'm planning to get the second part.",1422230400,,375,4.514705882352941

I bough the entire series and found later on, after viewing it repeatedly, that disc 1 had an error on it which prevented it from playing. This was the replacement disc. I can think of no better way to get introduced to Witch Hunter Robin than to view this first volume 1. It's a good story with some great characters in it. Enjoy.",1388707200,,397,4.306666666666667

7997795,3,B0000APVIX,"Robin is a 15-year-old witch hunter. She is the newest member of a group that investigates homicides that may involve witchcraft. She is also the only member of the team that uses witchcraft. This makes the other members of the team kind of hesitant to work with her. She quickly shows that she is capable, and intuitive. Thanks to her, the team has become much more powerful in the pursuit of justice.

This anime is very different. Nothing about it stands out. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, character designs and story are all very blahse. The only strong point that this series has so far is the great background animation. All of the scenery is very well done. Unfortunately, the characters are all very boring. Both their personalities, and their design. The main character has no personality. She is very soft spoken and calm. She also dislays little to no emotion. The story is also quite bland. Nothing exciting really happens. There are several bad guys in volume 1, but they are never very cool or tough.

Witch Hunter Robin has a very episodic feel to it, kind of like Cowboy Bebop. The diference is that none of the characters have any charisma, and the story is very slow moving. For 2002, the character animation is very slack. They are not very detailed. I can't believe that this volume got all those 5 star reviews. I'm very disappointed. Mind you, I am only reviewing volume 1. The series has just gotten started and there is plenty of time for it to heat up. It has a good premise, so I think that it is very possible for it to get good. So far though, it gets barely average marks all the way across the board.",1360886400,,1641,4.559322033898305
7997796,5,B0000APVIX,"Witch Hunter Robin is a laid back series even though it is meant to be different. It's a perfect blend, not too much action but just enough to keep you interested and the story catches your ear as soon as the show starts. The series is very relaxing but not boring as young Robin enters a coffee shop to have an unexpected important conversation with a bartender to help settle her into her new home. She was in an Italian convent but she was never a regular child so now at 16 she returns to where she belongs in her native Japan. She has something that can help her contain and destroy witches, she can create fire that becomes a powerful weapon but no one truly knows her level of strength. You are in for a ride but you don't find a major mystery until the middle of the series and you won't crack it until the very last episode and even then you may still have unanswered questions. These first episodes are just to settle you in to get to know the witch hunting team of the STNJ and their abilities and also the fantastic main character Robin.",1137974400,2,1049,4.276381909547739
