486202,4,6302593220,"Having seen several versions of this classic on stage, including the USO production in Heidleberg, Germany, in 1968, I can easily recommend this video. Although some important scenes are either left out or just shown in  passing, this video captures the spirit of Romberg's music quite well. The  addition of ""I'll Walk With God"" seems to have been put in only  to showcase Mario Lanza's talents; I think it is not a fitting adjunct to  the accurate telling of Romberg's tale.
I originally saw this film when  it was new; I was 9 years old. My 11 year old sister and our Mother went  along. After the show was over, my sister was perplexed. She asked Mother,  ""Which one was Mary O'Lanza?"" We still laugh about that  today!
A good follow-up to this film would be ""Deep in My  Heart,"" the Sigmund Romberg story, starring Jose Ferrar.",954806400,9,832,4.605442176870748

486281,4,6302593220,"In many ways ""The Student Prince"" is a dated curiosity, its music and singing a relic of late 19th century posturing for that high tone stature epitomized by the word ""operetta,"" an assurance that the words would be pronounced with many ah's, rolling r's, and melodramatic melodies. Composer Sigmund Romberg didn't bargain for the likes of Mario Lanza, though, whose voice is billed as a star of the show. It is.

A little background on the disembodied voice. Lanza was trim and in good form as table rehearsals for the movie began. His previous movie, ""Because You're Mine,"" had him in a bad mood because he saw it as a major comedown after his historic performance in ""The Great Caruso."" At the start of ""Because You're Mine,"" Mario's tendency to gain weight had become a full blown mania. He was huge. As principal photography began, he received word that his next movie would be ""The Student Prince,"" a fact he mentioned zestfully on his half hour radio show.

He began losing weight and continued shrinking visibly throughout shooting on ""Because You're Mine."" He bottomed out at 159 pounds, as slim as you will ever see Lanza in a film. Oddly, the first scene in the movie was shot on that last day. He stands in line at the military draft office and is shirtless awaiting his physical. He looks terrific, all toned up for ""The Student Prince.""

MGM's new and disastrous chief Dory Schary despised Mario Lanza and probably felt that having an ""Italian peasant"" in the role of a Prussian prince was an affront to millionaire country clubers everywhere. He saw that director Curtis Bernhardt baited Lanza with references to Lanza's supposedly rough-edged acting style. Long before pre-recording of songs began, Lanza, actually an afficionado of operetta, was grousing about the inclusion of three songs not penned by Romberg, ""Summertime in Heibelberg,"" ""I'll Walk with God,"" and ""Beloved."" Lanza acquiesced to these additions and sang them beautifully, but he felt damage had been done to a masterpiece.

Bernhardt did criticize Lanza's reading of his lines, repeatedly accusing the actor of crudity and a lower class sensibility. Lanza was infuriated and, temperamental fellow that he was, confronted Bernhardt repeatedly. Then came the pre-recordings, the pressing of the records that would become the movie's soundtrack.

Lanza was never in better voice. Recording was proceeding without a hitch until he did his first cut of that newly written song, ""Beloved."" Bernhardt told Lanza to do it over. Mario couldn't believe it. Slice and dice his acting, OK, he's not Marlon Brando, but coming after his singing, claiming he's too ""emotional"" and ""unrefined,"" that was it! Lanza blew up. He ran to a probably pleased Schary and demanded a change of directors. After much angst and anger, Bernhardt was retained and Lanze re-recorded ""Beloved."" It was indeed less emotional than the previous cut; both renditions are gorgeous.

Ultimately, Bernhardt's quibblings became too much. Lanza exploded once too often, and Schary fired the tenor, sued him, and got to use his recordings as Edmund Purdom, a handsome, Britishy-sounding dude, was hired to act and dub. Lanza was devastated and financially ruined by Schary. He did not record again for three years and did not appear in another movie until 1956's ""Serenade.""

""The Student Prince"" billed the stars, Purdom and Ann Blythe, and then featured ""the singing voice of Mario Lanza."" The only other time a voice got billing in a major movie was Giorgio Tosti's in ""South Pacific,"" because Tosti demanded it. Lanza got billing because his voice sold tickets. Dory Schary, actually a screenwriter by trade, went on to become the worst studio head imaginable, and Lanza has left us much to be remembered by.

The sound track of ""The Student Prince"" is far and away the finest performance of Romberg's classic by any tenor past or present. The singing features the sweetness of ""Summertime in Heidelberg"" and ""Deep in My Heart, Dear,"" the power of ""Serenade"" and ""I'll Walk with God,"" the youthful longing of ""Golden Days,"" and, of course, the restrained and haunting beauty of ""Beloved."" Purdom worked tirelessly to lip sync credibly, and he pulls it off, ironically, quite a bit better than Mario ever did in his other movies!

The movie itself is uneven. Lanza had fine chemistry with Ann Blythe in ""The Great Caruso."" Purdom does not; he never really recovers from early scenes when he arrogantly propositions the barmaid. The scenes between them are stiff and a bit cold. The story is timeless. Purdom feigns sword fighting better than Lanza would have done, so there's that.

Is the film worth watching? I'd say yes, if you are a fan of Lanza and would like to view his glorious singing in the setting of the play.

Incidentally, that horrid director was replaced after Lanza left.",1465171200,3,4835,4.978934324659232

Edmund Purdom (the Prince) at the beginning is a pompous, opinionated, jerk.  His teacher, the Professor, is a master at gently but firmly getting his points across about the behavior which should be exhibited.
Edmund Purdom does an excellent job of lip syncing to Mario Lanza's outstanding tenor voice.  Knowing of the lip syncing, I watched to see if the actor incorporated other important traits of a true singer into his performance.  I was very happily surprised to see that he does.
I have always loved the performances by S.Z. Sakall and Edmund Gwenn and they were terrific in this visually beautiful and musically moving movie.
Others have mentioned poor quality of this re-mastered edition.  Remember it is a 1954 film.

486440,4,6302593220,"MGM's 1954 CinemaScope production of THE STUDENT PRINCE (first filmed as a silent in 1928 starring Norma Shearer) was originally slated to be a reunion for Mario Lanza and his ""Great Caruso"" leading lady Ann Blyth.  What finally reached the screen was a disappointment for Lanza's fans, with his part taken by non-singer Edmund Purdom, but the production as a whole is lushly put-together and one of the best from MGM's musical pantheon.

Based on the tried and true Sigmund Romberg operetta, THE STUDENT PRINCE is the story of Karl Franz, the prince of Karlsberg.  Betrothed to a lovely princess (Betta St. John), Karl is nevertheless something of a ""Prussian pickle"" - that is, quite dull and reserved - so his grandparents (Louis Calhern and Evelyn Varden) pack him off to school in Heidelberg, where it's hoped that he'll loosen up and become a more fully-rounded individual.

In Heidelberg, Karl falls head over heels for Kathie Ruder (Ann Blyth), the most popular and beloved barmaid at the tavern where all the students converge daily.  After a few humorous mishaps, Kathie cannot deny her own feelings either, and the two decide to elope.  Their plans are halted when Karl is ordered to return to Karlsberg, where his grandfather is on his deathbed.

There are several conflicting stories as to why Mario Lanza walked off the film - and subsequently fired by MGM.  The most famous story is that Lanza was piling on the weight, making life very difficult for the costumiers who were, as a consequence, constantly having to tweak his wardrobe.  There is another story, given credence by several biographers, which insist that a fight between Lanza and the film's initial director Curtis Bernhardt was the catalyst for Lanza leaving the film.  Lanza wanted MGM to give him his ""Great Caruso"" director Richard Thorpe instead - and indeed, after Lanza was fired, Thorpe wound up replacing Bernhardt!

I tend to believe it must have been a mixture of both stories.  Lanza's rise to fame was so fast - he clearly wasn't prepared for it, and of course, it had to have gone to his head.  He indulged in wine and food, and made demands, naturally, but I think he just needed people who he knew would get the best possible work out of him, to support and encourage him in every way.  Evidently he held his ""Great Caruso"" director Richard Thorpe in such high esteem.

As part of the legal settlement, MGM was awarded ownership of Lanza's ""Student Prince"" recordings, which he had laid down before filming started.  The score of THE STUDENT PRINCE had been augmented with three extra songs for Lanza - ""I'll Walk with God"", ""Beloved"" and ""Summertime in Heidelberg"".  MGM brought in British actor Edmund Purdom to replace Lanza and he mouths quite well to Lanza's vocals, bringing off the role of Karl accordingly with a lot of dash.

It's quite surprising to note that this was Ann Blyth's first full-length movie musical role.  After a career spent mainly at Universal (where she made such films as ""Mr Peabody and the Mermaid"" and ""The World in His Arms"") to a spell at Warner Brothers, earning an Academy Award nomination for her role as Veda in ""Mildred Pierce"", Blyth moved to MGM where she made a big musical splash in this film and 2 other gargantuan 'Scope musical productions, namely ""Rose Marie"" and ""Kismet"".  Here in THE STUDENT PRINCE, Ms Blyth is utterly enchanting as Kathie.  When all is said and done, this film really does belong to her, and I think it's one of her best.

The supporting cast is also first-rate, including S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall as Kathie's uncle, and John Ericson as Count Von Asterburg - his subplot, playing a fellow aristocratic student in a rivalry with Karl, builds up to a payoff which fizzles away, never really paying off in the way it should.

Warner Archive's DVD-R of the film looks quite remarkable, to these eyes at least.  STUDENT PRINCE was filmed in the Ansco-Color process - cheaper color film which faded horribly over time.  Technicians at Warner Archive have worked wonders with this print and the colours look vivid and lush.  There is a lot of print damage but that is to be expected.  The only extra is the theatrical trailer which runs for close to 5 minutes.",1408752000,6,4213,4.775172413793103

Songs range from drinking songs at the university to ""I'll Walk With God"" as the prince is crowned.  Of course, the technology is that of 60 years ago; but it works for a story that takes place in the nineteenth century.

This movie is often forgotten when one looks at the repertoire of Lanza films.  Actually, the film is successful because of him.  The acting is fine, the lip cinching by Edmund Purdom is convincing, the story is good but the real quality, the real secret is Mario Lanza.

Mario Lanza was the most versatile tenor who ever walked on a stage. He could sing opera like the greatest tenors of all time. He was a master at ""crossing over"" from lyric opera to popular singing. As a result, he was a top recording artist and concert performer. In the ""Great Caruso"" he also showed he could be a global movie sensation. The movie about the amazing Neapolitan tenor actually was about Mario Lanza. It turned the Great Caruso into the Great Lanza. He exhibited all of his splendid qualities.

I love ""The Student Prince"" for it's music and, most of all, for the wonderful singing of Mario Lanza.  His movies, and recordings inspired me to write my recent book about him: ""A Kid from Philadelphia, Mario Lanza, the Voice of the Poets."" It is not a biography. There have been several excellent bios about him. This is a book from a fan. It exhibits his qualities, talents, passion and love for his art. I wanted it to be a ""page turner"" that would be impossible to put down while listening to the magnificent voice of Mario Lanza.

Anyone who loves Lanza the movie star, the tenor, the popular singer and the human being who did so much in such a short time will love this film.",1381536000,,1703,5.060714285714286

From what I understand, Lanza was not well known in the movie business, so he being strictly opera, the producers weren't sure he could carry a movie, so he dubbed the singing for the lead actor...and did it very well.
In Hollywood, 'lip syncing' is done in reverse... The singer sings to the actor on screen...and it is done very well.

As I said, the voice of Mario Lanza singing the songs can't be beat. What can I say, I love an Italian Tenor. I would recommend this to people who love the standard music of the 50s.  My only concern is the volume difference between the speaking and singing. I have to turn the volume up for speaking, but down for singing as it's too loud.

In the case of this one, I will stipulate that Edmond Purdom appears to be singing, so kudos there; I did not know
that Ann Blythe was actually singing and her acting was at least credible (count me as not a fan of hers).  Mr. Purdom ""starred""
 in some forgettable roles in his time (e.g.,""The Egyptian""), and here one can believe he is a frustrated princeling who finds love and comradery at Heidelberg University.
There are some characters who are deliciously portrayed:  Louis Calhern as an aging but feeling King,John Williams as the stiff valet who keeps the King apprised  of his son's escapades, Edmund Gwenn as the lovable professor who almost steals the show and last but by no means least the perpetual gnome and lovable innkeeper, ""Cuddles"" Zacall.

Sigmund Romberg's musical was first heard in New York in 1924. The 1954 film version was produced by Joseph Pasternak and directed by Richard Thorpe.

The story concerns the adventures of young and handsome Prince Karl of Karlburg as he attends the University of Heidelberg. Louis Calhern plays his father, the King. Although engaged to be married to the Princess Johanna of North Hausen, the Prince falls for the barmaid Kathie (Ann Blyth) at the local tavern. Despite their love for each other, the Prince eventually has to return to the palace and accept his duties when the King falls ill. Lanza's deep and powerful voice is not entirely compatible with the rather slender frame of Purdom, but that is a relatively minor quibble in a film full of colourful sets and wonderful music.

The songs include the `Serenade', `When it's summertime in Heidelberg', `Deep in my heart', the `Drinking Song', `Beloved' and `I'll walk with God' as well as the perennial student favourite Gaudeamus Igitur. Excellent entertainment!",1345507200,,1256,4.864485981308412

With all that is at their command you think they could package these films a little better! Some have trailers, some don't have anything and I don't know what they are burning them on, but a lot of them won't work on my slight older (5 yr) DVD player.

This film IS amazing to watch for it's color and music and a great example of what a studio (MGM) did best : produce musicals! Even though this film came along very near the end, it still has a lot of the same values (and creative staff) as some of their classics. Ann Blyth didn't do many musicals for MGM (Rose Marie and Kismet) so this is a rare capture of her talent. It also uses the singing voice of Mario Lanza for Edmund Purdom. Having seen Lanza in a few earlier MGM musicals and now watching Purdom in the role of The Prince, it's hard to see the former acting it. The supporting cast is great and it's nice to see it in the fabulous MGM Technicolor.

I just can't get over the fact that the DVD (again, along with the others WB are releasing) seem rushed in putting them together and out there.",1334534400,4,1206,4.171673819742489

486641,5,6302593220,"Warner's release at long last, of MGM's early Cinemascope film, is a celebration.  There have been many unlicensed copies around from Spain and Asia - finally we have the real thing.  And it is an extremely presentable disc.

Forget the negative reviews posted here, and the wrong information. The film is in its original 2.55 extra wide ratio and stereo. Warner should have released this film long ago, with full remastering and 5.1 sound.  By holding it for so long, we have to put up with DVD-R due to falling demand for pressed older films.

Although ""remastered"" the image quality is at times a little too grainy and the colour is not perfect - a problem with the stock used at the time by MGM.

Overall however this does not deter from enjoyment of a magical and beautiful film.  Lanza's songs shine and Purdom's acting and lip synching is fine; he is supported by Ann Blyth and a host of great supporting actors like Louis Calhern, Edmund Gwenn & SZ Cuddles Sakall.

Warner Bros should be drawn and quartered for putting such a fine MGM classic out on DVD in such shocking condition and to still charge a high price. Yes I consider $24.49 high when many classics of good condition can be purchased for under $15.

Maybe this is what Warner Bros is all about with their DVD on demand, only printing when required and not caring about the individual who wants to save it as a classic. IF only MGM was still here and owned their own movies this may not happen.

At the inn where he is staying as a student, he falls in love with a barmaid (Ann Blyth) even though he is betrothed to a Princess (Betta St. John). This musty old operetta by Sigmund Romberg has been dusted off and gussied up in CinemaScope, stereophonic sound and Ansco color but it still creaks. While it might have worked in the 1930s with the likes of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, was there still a market for this in 1954? Blyth is in fine voice but Purdom is dubbed by Mario Lanza. Lanza had been cast in the part and recorded his songs before leaving MGM in a dispute and since they had the rights to the vocal tracks, MGM simply recast the part using Lanza's vocals. The film is rather saccharine though the ending is effectively bittersweet. Musically, it's a crashing bore with all those Romberg songs about drinking beer but the loveliest song in the movie, Beloved, isn't even written by Romberg but was written especially for the film by Paul Francis Webster and Nicholas Brodszky. Directed by Richard Thorpe. With Louis Calhern, Edmund Gwenn, John Ericson, Evelyn Varden, John Williams, S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall, John Hoyt, Richard Anderson and John Qualen.

486671,5,6302593220,"This needs to be placed on DVD in its original  widescreen (Cinemascope) format (it was shot in MGM's -ughh!- Anso-Color, not Technicolor, which however suited the chocolate box operetta genre) and was produced in 4-channel stereo.
This is a short (98 mins) film that eliminates the ponderous elements of the stage show - including a couple of songs.
It adds three, superior,  non-Romberg songs that fit the operetta genre perfectly:- ""I'll Walk With God"" - an aria/anthem/hymn a major hit; ""Beloved"" - an operatic aria and quite glorious; and ""Summertime In Heidelberg"" which displays the sweetest vocal timbre Lanza has ever put on to screen. The lyrics of the original stage numbers all have significant, and worthy, alterations which neither add to nor subtract from the original.
Lanza's voice here in 1954 is far superior - far fresher and more lyrical with more light, shade and power - than his his 1959 RCA LP version where his voice was recorded quite dryly.  Edmund Purdom does a wonderful job lip-synching Lanza's voice, whilst convincingly portraying the Prince's journey from initial Teutonic stiffness"" demeanour, through a fish-out-of-water stage to his blossoming into a sociable creature capable of loving.
Ann Blyth's mezzo timbre blends well with Lanza's off-screen voice and her acting reflects well the ambivalence of the bar-maid Kathy's character towards this intrusion into her life very successfully. The student ensemble numbers are excellent representation of student boisterousness (tempered by the class system - the choral work is evocative and when Lanza's voice joins in the ""Drink, Drink, Drink"" number, there is a goose-bump effect. In fact all of his singing here is goose-bump material. No one has sung ""I'll Walk With God"" better.
It is all well-staged and a credit to all who participated
The VHS was originally released on VHS tape - it deserves a DVD release in the original Cinemascope ratio - and in stereo.

486672,5,6302593220,"THE STUDENT PRINCE is a superb musical.  The costumes are gorgeous.  The settings are old-world beautiful, and some of them, (the palace scenes), are sumptuous indeed.  The songs are wonderful.  The singing is wonderful, (did Ann Blythe actually sing, or was the voice dubbed?)  But the story....well, (NECESSARY SPOILER........), the story end sadly, as the student prince must leave the beautiful barmaid for a future royal bride.....

The world has definitely changed since this musical was made!  A few months from the day I write this, (26th February, 2011), the event that so much of the world eagerly waits, (on the date of 29th April, 2011), is to take place, when, (in REALITY), Prince William of England, second in line to his father, Prince Charles, is to marry Kate Middleton, and she then will become Princess Catherine of England....  As most people know, they met at St. Andrews' College.  Miss Middleton was a well-off uppper-middle-class girl, not, (as in this musical), a barmaid...but certainly not of royal or even noble birth, either.  (Although research, just before and after the Royal Engagement was announced, proved that Ms. Middleton IS actually Prince William's 15 cousin!)

I have read that commoners have quietly been marrying into the Royal families of Europe since World War II.  Certainly the preponderance of royal-commoner marriages in Europe now proves this without a doubt.  Of course, these commoners must be uncommonly well-spoken, without taint of arrest, and meet other, sometimes secret, royal crieria.  But the importance of Love has, finally, won over even
many hard and fast royal traditions.  (Perhaps the lessons of the tragedy of Princess Margaret's lost love, and the even greater tragedies of Crown Prince Rudolph and Countess Maria Vetsera -- who committed suicide -- and that of the Nepalese Royal Family, (most of whose members were murdered by an enraged Crown Prince, when denied the woman of his choice --were not all in vain.  Will Royal Rules go back to where they were in the last generation, once all these new royal-commoner marriages produce enough offspring for more royal choices in marriages?
Or will the spirit of Love, and the understanding of the strength that Love produces, continue, so that at least some of these future royal offspring will marry for love, and allow more commoner-royal marrriages that stay within the royal
sphere, as so many of today's royal marriages do?

No matter.  This musical, THE STUDENT PRINCE, shows not only wonderful production values all around, but also has a story which is timeless in it's message of love.
The Prince may indeed go off at the end to find another, Royal bride....but his heart, I am sure, will alway remember the beauteous barmaid.  And, I believe, being denied her made this fictional prince, eventually a king laden with sadness that he would not otherwise have had.

Unless of course, there could be a future sequel -- in which there is a revolution, which frees not only those who think they are oppressed by this fictional monarchy....but frees the monarch within that monarchy, as well! <3 <3

In this story a stuffy, arrogant German Prince is sent to university in Heidelberg to learn how to be human. Of course, in the classic plot, he falls in love with the beautiful barmaid but is then forced to give this love up to do his duty to his country. This is inevitable when his father, the King, dies and he has to assume the throne. There is now no question of him running away with his love and he must rather seek an alliance with a bride of royal blood.

For some reason (perhaps out of nostalgia), I ordered the movie, and I found that I was engaged throughout most all of the scenes, the music was fun and stuck in my head for hours afterward, and the scenery was beautiful as well.

The only thing I found interesting about the storyline, was the fact that the Prince started out as a cold hard military man, basically sexually harassing the poor common bar wench, and in the span of a few scenes, she pretty much forgets about how he was ""copping a feel"" and she falls desperately in love with him.  And he turns into the perfect gentleman, contradicting all the prior years of strict military training, teaching us that all you need is some beer to loosen up and become a better person.  And apparently, the person who wrote the storyline also believes that treating a woman like that is okay because in the end she's going to fall in love with you anyway.  I don't blame her, though.  The prince is hott.

I'm obviously exaggerating with a slight bit of sarcasm, but it's interesting to view a movie from a different era.

The only disappointing thing about this movie is that Mario Lanza did not get to perform the part of the prince even though he had recorded all the songs for the movie--it's his voice you hear--and the screenplay was written especially for him.  But because he had a problem controlling his weight, the studio replaced him with Edmund Purdom, whom I think did a superb job overall--you can not tell he's not the one really singing.  I love Ann Blyth as the leading lady--so lovely and so is her voice.  All the songs are beautiful, and Mario's voice is out of this world.  I gave my video to Anthony Kearns(one of the Irish Tenors) at one of his concerts and told him they should do a remake of this movie using him as the prince (of course they would have to deal with the Irish accent).

Lanza wanted to play the Prince evolving from a disciplined Prussian into a passionate lover.  The Director would not allow the metamorphosis.  Lanza would have been great in this role, but he just couldn't tolerate what he thought (correctly, I believe) was the absurd juxtaposition of the sometimes sentimental other times pleading or romantic music/lyrics... with the Director's insistence that the lead be played almost devoid of emotion.

486805,4,6302593220,"Edmund Purdom does a fine job of lip-synching to Mario Lanza in this beautiful fairytale of a movie. The combination of Lanza's glorious romanticism and Purdom's very British demeanour is an odd combination, but it works - after a fashion. It helps that Purdom was actually singing along with Lanza's pre-recorded vocals - a daunting task for any singer, let alone a non-professional like Purdom. (The actor spent three months practising with the recordings, and commented 20 years later: ""It was enough to make you sweat - just listening to the voice."")
It's to Purdom's credit that he persevered, for Lanza's singing is at the very core of this movie. The Serenade, Drinking Song, Beloved, Golden Days and I'll Walk With God are without peer, and represent the pinnacle of Lanza's achievement in English language song. Lanza's timbre was at its most ravishing by this time (1952) and he imbues these songs with such magic that every word sparkles - a feat not lost on Purdom, who later compared Mario's poetic artistry to that of the great soprano Elizabeth Schwarzkopf.
The Student Prince is loosely based on Sigmund Romberg's operetta, with three new songs (Beloved, I'll Walk With God and Summertime in Heidelberg) by Nicholas Brodszky replacing some of the more dated Romberg numbers. The film is a decided improvement on the creaky original and boasts a witty script, replete with memorable one-liners from the screen-writing duo of Sonya Levien and William Ludwig, scenarists for Lanza's The Great Caruso.
Ann Blyth provides worthy support as Kathy, the barmaid with whom The Student Prince falls in love, and the hilarious supporting cast includes such seasoned pros as Edmund Gwenn, SZ (Cuddles) Sakall and John Williams.
Aside from Lanza's absence, what ultimately makes this merely a good movie rather than a classic is Richard Thorpe's uninspired direction. His stolid by-the-numbers approach (ie long shot, then medium shot, then close-up) is at its most obvious during the musical numbers, where he lacks the magical touch that the story - and the music - demands. Still, he was undoubtedly a better choice than Curtis Bernhardt, the ""Prussian pickle"" (to paraphrase one of the characters in this movie) originally slated to direct, and the real reason for Lanza walking out on The Student Prince.
But watch this movie for its irresistible fairytale appeal, and the magic of Mario Lanza at his extraordinary best.",1003190400,19,2428,5.103015075376884
486806,5,6302593220,"The title for this review is a reference to the scene in the movie in which Prince Karl's antics in a restaurant result in the dismissal of the heroine, Kathie Ruder, from her job as a waitress. After she turns in her uniform on that clear night, she subsequently has a hostile encounter with the Prince in the street, and shortly afterwards, he breaks into Romberg's immortal ""Serenade"", which no one to this day can sing quite like Mario Lanza.
 While it is regrettable that Lanza lost the title role of this film in in a 1954 scandal that looks like absolutely nothing compared to the O.J. Case, his angelic vocalization is the main course of this colorful, delectable tale.
 Edmond Purdom managed to do justice to the part of the prince who walks with kings but until he goes to the University of Heidelberg, has no idea how to keep the common touch. Betta St. John is his very regal fiance who, after being the guest of honor at a sumptuous ball, brings the Prince's lack of warmth and charm to the attention of the king and queen, setting the events of this story in motion. While this colorful film tanked at the box office, it is quite enjoyable to watch because many people can identify to having to drop out of school or a job because of a family crisis, as Prince Karl must during the course of this story. Ann Blyth has a lot of maturity as the love interest who helps a prince grow up, Edmund Gwenn as the jovial Professor Juttner and John Williams as the stuffy Lutz help give the prince a bit of balance as he saunders back and forth between the two worlds of royal tradition and University life. Interestingly, it was around this time that Britain's Prince Charles became the first Royal to be educated outside of Buckingham Palace--a major media event because it was hoped that he would become a better monarch if he was better acquainted with the people he would one day rule.
 Louis Calhern is every inch the regal monarch, still maintaing a booming authority in his voice even when he is termianlly ill. Evelyn Varden is his shrewd Queen. In one of his last performances, S.Z. Sakall, the only cast member with a German accent, plays the inkeeper who watches as the prince learns to become a person, but tries to keep the relationship between the prince and his niece from becoming too serious.
 In the end the paths of lovers may sever. But ""The Student Prince"" is a musical that will be remembered forever. Rather than being mournful, however, its motto is ever relevant:"" Gaudeamus Igitur"".--""Let us rejoice while we are young!""",1001894400,66,2551,4.575492341356674
