It is one of the most crazily entertaining DVD's out there to help one learn the Spanish language.  We enjoyed it very much, and would hope that you would, too!",1276732800,,306,4.527272727272727
8057006,5,B000933H2G,"I watch these videos in spanish (duh..)
and they are the BEST.
not only do they waste time and have two members for my favorite band ( Rob Cantor and Joe Hawley from Tally Hall)
but the videos are so funny!",1203379200,,206,4.048780487804878
8057007,3,B000933H2G,"I have small kids (4-6) there are scenes not appropriate for them. I speak fluently Spanish and noticed right away a few mistakes. One of them: I am disgusted. They translated: ""Estoy disgustado"". It is completely wrong. In Spanish you would say: ""Me da asco"" or ""me causa repugnancia"".  Disgustado means the same like enojado = angry. This dvd could be ok for children in 8th grade. The price is a little too high.",1181865600,,415,4.608108108108108
8057008,5,B000933H2G,"I took Spanish YEARS ago and needed a quick refresher.  This was truly Refreshing.  I grinned my way through learning how to ask questions, express things better, and just communicate better while I visit Mexico.  It worked great.  I told a number of people about this great find.",1114041600,4,280,4.770833333333333
8057009,5,B000933H2G,"I bought this DVD for my kids to help them get a head start in Spanish class, and I ended up watching the whole thing myself! I laughed, my kids laughed, and we all learned. Very good for all ages.",1112745600,5,197,3.95
