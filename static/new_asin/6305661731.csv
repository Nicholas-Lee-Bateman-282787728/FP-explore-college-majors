1056505,5,6305661731,"I'm addicted!!!  I do one of the tapes in the collection every day.  I had never tried yoga before getting these tapes.  They are awesome tapes.  Alan Finger's voice and accent are calming.  Alan gives instruction, while other's perform the poses (asanas).  It's helpful because one of the models does modified poses for those who are less flexible.  Since I've gotten these tapes, I've borrowed others (done by other people) from friends and I must say my Yoga Zone tapes are still my favorite.  The models seem so serene, no pasted on smiles.  I can't say enough, I feel wonderful doing these tapes.  My muscles get a workout, and my mind relaxes.",970444800,156,649,4.714285714285714
1056506,5,6305661731,"This is a great collection of videos.  I had practiced yoga in college, but had not practiced in a few years.  This set was a great way to get back into it.  This is a well balanced collection.  Alan Finger does a great job  of emphasizing breathing and only doing as much as you can.  Each tape is  an hour long, so you are getting the most for your money.  I highly  recommend these videos for anyone wanting to try yoga.",961977600,60,423,4.1234567901234565
1056507,5,6305661731,"After receiving my Yoga Zone tapes, I did the workout twice the day I got them. I had never tried Yoga before using these tapes and had no idea that you could get such a total workout not only for your body, but your mind as  well. I am a firm believer in the power of yoga now! Alan Finger, the  instructor, does a wonderful job of helping out the viewer at home feel at  ease with his calming and assuring voice. 'Even if you can't make it to the  ankles, the knees are just fine!' I highly recommend this set to anyone who  is curious about yoga!",959731200,88,549,4.046296296296297
7892614,4,6305661731,"While I wasn't a beginner in yoga when I purchased this video, I hadn't practiced for years and found it challenging. I was out of shape. After I had myself back in shape again, I went back to see just how challenging it was and was so pleased at the progress I had made.

This is a good place to start with beginning yoga practice. Just do what you can do. Keep at it until you can do more of it and do it better. It's a low-key approach, which is my style. If you want a more athletic approach that makes you sweat and you are already in great shape and/or love aerobic exercise, this probably isn't it.",1266192000,,605,4.084033613445378
7892615,3,6305661731,"I am a beginner in yoga, and I did enjoy the ""Introduction to Yoga"" tape. Personaly, I did not like what few psuedoscientific comments made by Master Alan Finger. I also could not find ""Meditation"" tape to be worth a while. The ""Conditioning and Stress Release"" tape and the ""Flexibility and Tone"" tape have many redundant instructions from ""Instruction to Yoga"". Again, I am being subjective as I review this tape collection. If you are just begining yoga, and just want something to start with, my suggestion is to get only the ""Introduction to Yoga"" tape.",1079395200,23,558,4.822916666666667
7892616,5,6305661731,"I started using this set of tapes about 2 years ago.  At first I was very sporadic, but have recently started doing a tape 3-4 days a week. These tapes are wonderful for beginners.  I've tried other yoga tapes and have been unable to keep up and to understand the directions.  I am nowhere near the capability shown on the tapes, but am able to keep up.  I hope to continue using this set for years as one of these days, I may actually be able to do all the exercises just as the yoga experts do!  You do have to set aside an hour for each tape and that was the hard part for me at first.  However, like other habits you just have to keep doing it.",1072137600,7,648,3.9844961240310077
7892617,5,6305661731,"Yes, even the uncoordinated can learn to do these tapes. If you are looking for a ground-floor, basic start to your yoga practice, this is an excellent place to start. I made the mistake of trying a more challenging tape first, which made me feel like an uncoordinated loser, and after mastering these tapes I found that I had the basics to take me to more challenging and athletic forms of yoga. I have loaned out my Introduction to Yoga tape to friends that want a taste of doing yoga, and find myself gravitating to the Conditioning and Stress Relief video, even though I've mastered it some time ago. I still love the feeling of the stress just releasing from my back and shoulders. These are the tapes that teach you the fundamentals, the most important of which is the breathing. This, for me, was the most challenging, as I tend to rush and hurry all day and this taught me to slow it down. I find I often use the breathing technique now, not only to get through more challenging poses but during my busy day also. The meditation tapes are wonderful. I don't use them as often as I should, but it would be a great resolution for the new year to start using them more regularly. It is a wonderful set that you will use for many years to come and a great foundation for building your own yoga practice.",1034985600,15,1307,4.382716049382716
7892618,5,6305661731,"I'm a 47 year old male beginner, having bought this box set and also having gone to four classes at local Yoga Centers.  Alan is so much better than the local instructors I've had here (in San Francisco).  His voice is very calm and soothing.  His instruction tells me how to move into the poses and tells me how to not hurt myself.  He allows for someone like me who is not very flexable and tells us how to accomplish beginner poses very easily.  The tapes are a very good value.  You get a lot for your money.  I've been through two of the tapes about four times and plan on using them once or twice a week for quite a long time.  I feel very peaceful and relaxed after doing one of the tapes.",1030838400,19,696,4.103703703703704
7892619,5,6305661731,"When I purchased these tapes, I was a true beginner at yoga.  I had absolutely no idea what to expect.  These tapes are fantastic.  Alan Finger is a great teacher and keeps you focused on breathing and correct form.  There are two women performing the poses and one of them shows the poses in a modified manner.  Alan is constantly describing modifications to do if you have a weak back, a weak neck, weak knees, etc.  He is also honest by telling you when a pose is very difficult and tells you only to go into the pose further if you can take a full breath.
The first tape that I would suggest doing is the Introduction to Yoga tape.  You will learn very basic yoga poses and it is accessible to a beginner.  The other two tapes include some more difficult poses as well as building on the poses you learn in the introduction tape.  A meditation tape is also included which is great for calming your mind and body.
Being a beginner, I was a little daunted by yoga.  BUT...this tape really makes you feel comfortable with the poses and allows you to progress at your own speed.  I have noticed a big difference since beginning to use these tapes.  My posture has improved and I sleep better at night.  I hurt my back in a car accident a couple of years ago and have found that yoga helps to eliminate my lower back pain.  You will be surprised by the number of muscles that yoga works.  It helps to tone your entire body and is a great supplement to more traditional cardiovascular exercise.",1030060800,15,1492,4.355072463768116
7892620,5,6305661731,"I first began Yoga in the latter 70's, but stopped when the aerobics craze hit full swing. I had also purchased Alan Finger's book ""Yoga Moves"" in the 80's, which is also available on video and is taken directly from the book, which came out in 1984, but is a little outdated now. However, the ""Yoga Zone"" tapes are his newest works and with them you CANNOT go wrong!
My spine is out of alignment, which has caused some back and shoulder problems and pinched nerves. My chiropracter advised me to take Yoga up again. He couldn't emphasize enough how good it is for you, so after researching tapes and reviews for some time, I decided on this set.
Alan gives VERY clear and detailed instructions throughout, so your are only limited by your own level of skill and capabilities, but that will change with practice. The workouts are nearly an hour each, but it doesn't seem long. Yoga is supposed to be as much introspective as it is physical, and the slow precision that Alan undertakes is the perfect accompaniment to tune into yourself as you perform the ""Yoga Moves"".
Don't let the term ""Beginner"" fool you. I tried the Yoga for Dummies, which is very well done, but is for EXTREME beginners. This is more advanced than that, but not extremely so, so your goals should be easy to achieve with time and practice.
Alan is a Yogi-raj and has practiced Yoga for 40 years now, so he knows what he doing and so will you if you follow these videos!!!",1015113600,118,1444,4.494296577946768
7892621,5,6305661731,"The tape recommends that you watch the tape at least once before attempting to practice. I'm not the type to do that and fortunately for me, he describes the movements so well that I did not even need to watch.  He has a excellent voice for instructing.  For me, a bad or annoying speaking voice can ruin anything.  Definitely not the case with this video.  There are two female instructors demonstrating the postures as the tape goes on.  One instructor demonstrates what to do if you are already flexible and the other demonstrates the technique for those who are less flexible and includes ways to minimize stress on tight hips. I do these before bed and afterwards feel as relaxed as if I've had a few drinks, but energized at the same time.  The next day, I still feel great.  For me the results (relaxation/energizing) were immediate and I have to talk myself out of doing the tapes too early in the evening, as they help me to sleep.",1012694400,33,940,4.5266272189349115
7892622,5,6305661731,"I'm a beginner at yoga, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this beginner box set. Alan Finger has a wonderful and thorough way of explaining the positions. You don't feel bored or watch the clock. His descriptions are clear and precise. He has a real calming effect on your nervous system. I highly recommend it to any beginner...",996537600,35,348,4.5396825396825395
