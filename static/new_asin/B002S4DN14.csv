8379055,5,B002S4DN14,Just what you'd expect.... beautiful skies.  I love having this play throughout the day. Nice when we have weeks of cloudy days here.,1400371200,,133,4.782608695652174
8379056,1,B002S4DN14,The disc doesn't play well.  I've tried it in different machines and it does the same thing.  The video freezes and the sound skips.,1363478400,,132,4.458333333333333
8379057,3,B002S4DN14,"great imagery...i just wish the scenes would last longer. it seems about each scene lasts about 15 seconds before changing, which makes this blu ray little more than a pretty live slideshow",1351468800,,189,4.9375
8379058,5,B002S4DN14,"I work at a cancer clinic. I ordered this bluray disc for the TV in our patient lobby area where we have a big LCD TV. It's a very nice collection of clips, nice relaxing music and I always find myself stopping when I walk past the TV and just staring at it for a moment before carrying on about my day. Good quality visuals, nice music, can't ask for more.",1331769600,,357,4.042253521126761
8379059,2,B002S4DN14,"Based on some comments left on several ""Living landscapes"" volumes by Mr. Heumann (from the producing Studio), I purchased nine volumes from this blu-ray series - all from the same Amazon seller - with the certainty that I could turn the music off, and hear just nature's sounds.

Out of the nine I purchased, there are THREE (""World's most beautiful Sunrises & Sunsets"", ""Four seasons"" and ""Bali"" - sadly, among my favourite ones), that do not provide any audio option at all (I made dead sure about that): you just have to watch them with the music playing.

I figure they're part of an older batch, but I believe the producing Studio should have made sure that ALL of them were pulled out of the market, before reassuring the customers about the adio specs.

Needless to say, I'm very disappointed by all of that. I've been meaning to contact the producing Studio to get a replacement but couldn't find an email contact for the life of me.

It's a shame, cause I'd be happy about my purchase if it wasn't for that.",1302739200,2,1017,4.571428571428571
8379060,5,B002S4DN14,"Dramatic Sunrises and Stunning Sunsets, rich and deep colors bring out the best in HiDef. The emotional images are nothing short of breathtaking. Full of Inspirational Sunrises and Melancholly Sunsets this video takes you on a satisfying emotional journey to the most exotic places on the planet. Great imagery to share on a special night with someone you love. I highly recomend it.",1285459200,3,383,5.095238095238095
8379061,1,B002S4DN14,"The best worldwide sunrises and sunsets in recorded history were in the year following the 1886 eruption of Krakatoa.

Cool sunrises and sunsets are a proxy for the level of air pollution.

PS. Come to New Zealand, a place with some of the most boring sunrises and sunsets (except when there are bush fires in Australia.)",1258588800,,321,4.714285714285714
8379062,2,B002S4DN14,"I AM VERY DIS-APPOINTED WITH THIS ITEM . A GREAT DEAL OF EDITED OR DUPLICATED MATERIAL FROM PREVIOUS DVDS BY THE PRODUCER OF THESE ITEMS . UNFORTUNATELY I PURCHASED THESE ITEMS FROM AMAZON .THE SAME SITUATION EXISTS WITH THE ITEM "" THE WORLDS MOST BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS "" .",1258588800,2,271,4.666666666666667
8379063,5,B002S4DN14,Stunning visuals that really bring out the best in my HDTV. The colors are rich and vibrant and the detail is great. I just turn this on my TV and will let it loop for hours as I get things done around the house. Highly recommend for videophiles!!,1257379200,2,247,4.166666666666667
