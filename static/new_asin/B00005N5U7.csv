1628183,5,B00005N5U7,"Set immediately after WWI and focusing gently around the troubles between the English and the Irish in Ireland, this layered saga rewards a viewer genuinely interested in the fate of its protagonist, the Englishman Major Archer (Ian Charleson). Major Archer's own mystifying and repeated ""troubles"" seem to eventually mirror the political troubles of British-occupied Ireland. And Ian Charleson gives a delicious performance that evokes just such an interest in his fate, no matter how eccentric his surroundings.

With Major Archer as the focus, this film makes wonderful viewing, as we see the British in Ireland through his eyes. And everything that happens to him, and the people around him, can also serve as metaphors of the times.

Major Archer's primary interactions are with a self-absorbed and outdated Englishman, Edward Spencer (played aptly by Ian Richardson) and his eccentric family, and a magnetic and coquettish Irish Catholic named Sarah (Emer Gillespie) whose charms Archer succumbs to. Sympathetic to the Irish cause, Major Archer has antagonists who are exemplified by the young and belligerently British Captain Bolton (Sean Bean). All three protagonists -- Charleson, Richardson, and Gillespie -- play their parts perfectly, and as the sprawling and multi-layered saga finally winds to a close, it feels moving and momentous.

This is Ian Charleson's last screen role, and a delightfully rich one. He plays the mild-mannered yet deep-feeling Major Archer with depth and with pitch-perfect affect. Lovely.

[Note: Americans and other non-Brits would do well to note that the term Sinn Fin is used frequently in the film; it is pronounced ""Shin Fayne."" This is the radical Irish Republican group, similar to the IRA. The slang term for the group is ""Shinners.""]

1628184,1,B00005N5U7,"One star is too high to rate this film.  I'd give it zero stars.  This is a very slow moving, boring, turgid film.  The setting is during the 1920's in a dilapidated old hotel, far past it's prime.  Several scenes are truly repulsive - many rooms of the hotel are full of swarms of wild cats, there are rotting body parts full of maggots found in the hotel rooms and the permanent residents of the hotel are comprised of a band of domineering, bossy old biddies.  The other hotel residents are in wheelchairs, invalids and pensioners.  The Palm Court of the hotel was supposed to be a garden patio bar - but instead is overgrown with wild weeds and overgrown shrubbery.

The film is very depressing and has a decayed creepy feeling.  The star of the film is a WWI veteran who very poorly acts out the symptoms of battle fatigue/shell shock by squinting every few minutes in a nervous tick.  His drippy fiance dies and then he takes up in a very odd, lukewarm courtship with an equally drippy local Irish woman.  The plot moves so slowly it is like watching paint dry.  I am a big fan of British films and ""art house"" cinema, Merchant/Ivory films - but this is a stinker.

The DVD cover falsely advertises Sean Bean in a starring role.  He isn't even a co-star, Sean Bean a teensy, tiny role and his first scene isn't even until 90 minutes into the movie. Sean Bean gives a very strong performance as an arrogant yet sexy, British military captain enforcing British colonialism which oppresseses Irish independence/Home Rule. The troop of soldiers he commands are supposed to bring stability, law and order to Dublin, but they wind up exacerbating the situation.  In an unsympathetic role, cast as a villian - Sean Bean manages to give a bravura performance in a very bad film.  But his part is so small it cannot save this film.

 Unless you are a very hard core, fanatic fan of his work, this DVD isn't worth buying.  For Sean Bean fans it might barely be worth watching for the ""Curiousity Factor"" simply to see him when he was an unknown actor at the very height of his early youth before he become an internationally known Hollywood, bankable star.

For your money's worth - you are better off watching Sean Bean in the ""Richard Sharpe"" series, ""Clarissa"", ""Extremely Dangerous"" ""Lord of the Rings"" ""Bravo Two Zero"", ""Golden Eye""  even ""Essex Boys"", which I didn't like because of horrendous, gruesome violence is a better chance to see Sean Bean at his best.

The studio/distributors of this film should be forced to change the packaging on the cover of the film.  It is false advertising and they are just unethically cashing in on Sean Bean's international star status to sell a very poor film in which he has a teensy, weensy, tiny role.",1159488000,8,2745,4.593429158110883
1628185,5,B00005N5U7,"Troubles is a moving, extended meditation on the British presence in Ireland, in the years just prior to that country's independence in 1922. Part comedy, part tragedy, this beautifully filmed drama follows a shell-shocked Major (Ian Charleson) from the trenches of WWI to a crumbling hotel situated in the Irish countryside. In the wake of his betrothed's sudden death, the Major stays on, beguiled by the hotel's bombastic owner, Edward Spencer (Ian Richardson). Soon adopted by an eccentric gathering of staff and guests (all expertly played), the Major is rescued from his isolation, and is ultimately entranced by Ireland itself.
Although the political significance behind much of what transpires between the English and Irish characters will likely be lost on a North American audience, Troubles can still be enjoyed simply as the Major's story, as we chart his gradual transformation from embittered war veteran to lover, confidante and friend.
The British military contingent is the least sympathetic element in the film, as it is surely meant to be. This undisciplined platoon, led by Sean Bean in a minor role, sparks two of the film's dramatic crises, and confirms all our suspicions regarding the evils of colonial domination.
It seems unfair that Ian Charleson, who died in 1990, did not receive more prominent billing in the current DVD release of this superb film. By replacing his cover image with those of Ian Richardson and Sean Bean, the studio has misled the public as to who is actually the star of Troubles, and who are the supporting players.",1077408000,13,1565,5.1171875

1628187,3,B00005N5U7,"Troubles is a quirky 1989 British film set in Ireland during the tumultuous time after the Easter Rebellion when Ireland as a whole was struggling for independence from Great Britain.  The film stars Ian Richardson (House of Cards) and Ian Charleson and opens in 1919 with Major Archer (Charleson), an Englishman, embarking on a trip to Ireland to visit his fiancee, Angela Spencer (Susannah Harker--Jane from Pride and Prejudice), who is also British.  Angela lives with her siblings and eccentric father, Edward (Richardson), who owns the Majestic Hotel in which they live.
The Hotel, once a glorious and magnificent bastion during the heyday of British rule, is now a dilapidated, ill-equipped shadow of its former self that is overrun with cats, vines, and tree roots bursting through the floor boards.  That the Irish cannot/will not any longer be made to conform to the ways of the British by the British is symbolised by the Hotel (itself a metaphor for British presence in Ireland) succumbing to the wild forces of nature which cannot/will not be denied, suppressed and controlled any longer.  The Hotel is also rife with images of decay and putrification, symbolic of the dying state of British rule.
Edward, in an attempt to bring the Majestic back to its former glory days, renovates the Hotel and holds a huge ball.  But it is too little too late, and like Ireland herself, there is no going back.  The irony, however, is that Edward's ball and the Hotel itself are sabotaged not by the forces of nature (which Edward, try as he might, ultimately cannot contain) but by the unruly and disrespectful British soldiers, by whose presence in Ireland, it may be argued, more harm was done than good.
As for the surface story (if it is a surface story and not yet another extended metaphor), upon arriving in Ireland, the Major, despite repeated attempts, sees Angela only once.  Shortly into the story Angela dies (apparently having been ill).  The Major then falls in love with Sarah, a spirited young Irish woman, but it too is a weird relationship.  That more or less is it, and if it sounds a bit thin, it is because it is.  The film is 200-minutes (split into two 100-minute parts), and I must confess I felt it dragged quite a bit.
Though the underlying themes are serious, the film is filled with a fair amount of comedy, but it is of a quirky nature as it arises out of the eccentricities of so many of the characters--particularly Edward Spencer.  I have not read the novel upon which the film is based, which I suspect might be quite good--certainly having read it would no doubt have enhanced my enjoyment and understanding of the film.  As it stands, my feelings about the film are quite mixed; certainly it's not one that I'm eager to re-watch.
For those who are curious about this film because it features Sean Bean, I would recommend any number of films before this one (ie. Sharpe, Extremely Dangerous, Bravo Two Zero, Golden Eye, Essex Boys, The Fifteen Streets).  The cover of the video misleadingly features a large photo of Bean and lists his name in large print beside Ian Richardson's, suggesting that Bean is a co-star.  Such is NOT the case.  Bean doesn't make an appearance until roughly 90-minutes into the show, and his role is a very, very small one (he's one of the soldiers--albeit the one in charge).
In conclusion, I would not give a general recommendation to this film, and I don't think it would be of great appeal to most Sean Bean fans.  It is a very specific group of people to whom this film will likely be of interest--ie. those who have read (and enjoyed) the novel, and possibly those with a strong interest in and knowledge of 20th-century Irish history.  (My level of knowledge (which is minimal) sufficed, but only just).",1032912000,27,3772,4.743119266055046
7946180,5,B00005N5U7,"Superb, in its way- not for everyone. Fine performances, noteworthy- the last performance of the great Ian Charleson. The story has lots of dramatic non-closures; what you expect to happen, doesn't -- like life itself or indeed the troubled times of the Irish war of independence. Both sides in the conflict are represented sympathetically,(the Black and Tans are shown to be the louts they were.) But this is not  primarily a political drama but one, properly, of persons trying to adapt to very troubled times. Beautifully done- but not a conventional drama- what turned off some of the more low rating critics, I think..",1513987200,,623,4.990384615384615
7946181,1,B00005N5U7,This movie can't decide if it is a farce or a serious drama about an important historical era whose effects are felt into our own time.

7946185,5,B00005N5U7,"A wonderfully engaging series which is sadly too short, but beautifully adapted to the small screen.  Ian Richardson is always excellent (The Gravy Train was a hilarious jaunt with Richardson at his humorous best).  In this story, Richardson plays the role of a British aristocrat unwilling to relinquish his domicile regardless of the fact that the British are no longer wanted on Irish soil.  It is both comic in places as well as sad and filled to the brim with irony.  The key player in this story is the Major played stoically by Ian Charleson who provides the viewer with a character both calm and capable as well as very human and engaging.  A wonderful epic to watch time and again.",1446681600,,690,4.669421487603306

I know the book is highly praised and so I was eager to read it.
I must admit that I found it most boring! I had expected so much more about the political situation,but that was only mentioned on the side. Mainly it was all just descriptions of boring scenes,mainly unrealistic.
The point of view was that of the English intruders and the way it was spoken about Irish people was very disrespectful.
I cannot at all recommend the book.",1380758400,,619,4.486725663716814
