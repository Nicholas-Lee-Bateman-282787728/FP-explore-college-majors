2223254,1,B0007NFMC6,"the movie is a bore because none of the characters are even remotely likeable.  there is nothing in this movie to draw a viewer into it.  clearly, the writers and director never took a writing course of any sort.  the characters in this movie are one dimensional, and very dislikeable.  all characters should have some kind of complexity or fullness.  the movie characters are mean spirited and nothing more.  their dialogue and acting are for shock only.  only it doesn't work.  in the back cover, they describe the female as seducing others and luring them to their deaths.  wow, someone has no idea what the word seduction means.  there is nothing seductive or erotic in this film.  nudity alone doesn't make a flick seductive or erotic.  minimal special features.  would like to have heard a commentary on how this thing got the distribution it did.  skip this over-priced mess.  or wait until there are a ton of used copies, which seems to be piling up now.",1113868800,3,962,4.710843373493976
2223255,3,B0007NFMC6,"...then you have some serious problems. Dead Doll is a very disturbing film about an loopy artist who kills his wacky girlfriend then preserves her body with some chemicals so he can keep her around. Even more disturbing is that the cadaver gets stolen by one sicko then another, to be defiled again and again; ending in madness and murder.

I guess the director/writer was trying to make a statement, in a very shocking and sometimes humourous way, about obsession and beauty and how some people get messed up by these concepts. The pacing of the film could be better along with its production values but it did not bore me.",1113177600,11,625,4.63063063063063
2223256,1,B0007NFMC6,"This movie is just a waste of time trust me, I cant believe I watched this crap. (it was so boring that I had to put the dvd to play on more than 16X to finish this thing)",1112745600,,171,3.526315789473684
8049268,3,B0007NFMC6,"Not a bad movie.
Had so much potential to be better.
I found it oddly entertaining.
Some comedic parts.
Not the worse I've ever seen.",1459209600,,133,4.36
8049269,1,B0007NFMC6,"I bought this movie purely based on the title. The movie SUCKS, I just use it to display lol",1447804800,,92,3.8947368421052633
8049270,1,B0007NFMC6,"Not a real horror movie, just a lame low budget porno",1436832000,,53,3.909090909090909
8049271,1,B0007NFMC6,"This has to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen in my life. That distinction used to go to ""Dumb & Dumber"" but that finally got beat. (Granted, I saw that one when I was a teenager and never made it through the whole thing because I was so grossed out. Who knows if I would feel the same today, as movies have gotten grosser than ever, what with shock value and all.)

So, as if sex scenes these days haven't gotten nasty enough... who wants to see horny men all over a doll? Yuck, yuck, yuck. But I must admit I did get a giggle out of the scene with the blade of glass. Too bad all rapes aren't as horrible for the man as well as the woman like that!!! Oh, and the scene where the guy's girlfriend was more turned on by the doll than him (because she ""had never been with a woman before and she was so pretty!"") was a little bit amusing. At least there was one guy who wanted to be with someone alive!

Then there's the guy who flips out at the doll for leaving the apartment (she seems to come alive now and then). ""Where've you been?"" ""Shopping."" ""That's f***ing bulls***."" Repeat conversation four times. And they've been in a ""relationship"" like two days. The next time she leaves, the guy trashes the apartment.

All I can figure is that the moral of the story is that men are pigs. Not that I always disagree, but it really seems like a dumb lesson to put in a movie... especially when the writer, producer, and director are all men.

This movie isn't even getting donated to the library. It's going in the trash. I wouldn't want anyone to realize it came from me. (By the way, I didn't even purchase it in the first place. It belonged to a friend. I watched a few of her movies to see if any were worth keeping before giving them to the library. I am sure glad I did. Just a disclaimer there.)",1333324800,2,1804,4.175287356321839
8049272,5,B0007NFMC6,"Looking for crazy, disturbing, reality type horror? Dead Doll has all of that with a pinch of insane! It's a polarizing movie. You either love it or hate it. It may be the only movie I've ever seen where all the main characters are completely worthless human beings.",1260748800,3,266,4.5625
8049273,5,B0007NFMC6,"I guess I'm not terribly surprised to see so many unfavorable reviews of Dead Doll--it's not an easily accessible film, and that's part of what makes it so good.  I'm tired of horror movies (movies in general, actually) that draw audiences in with flashy special effects and predictable plots that leave little room for interpretation or intelligent thought.  Audiences seem to expect that now--maybe that's why people have been saying this movie is boring.  A previous reviewer credited a large part of their disliking of the movie to the despicable characters.  Again, that's one of the best things about it!  Characters ought always to provoke strong reactions from the audience, even if it's revulsion.  Neutrality is boring, wouldn't you rather FEEL something?

Maybe it's because I'm a musician, but the music in Dead Doll is what really makes the movie for me.  The ensemble topped with screechingly out of tune violin is absolutely bone-chilling.  Kind of reminiscent of the Kronos Quartet soundtrack to Requiem for a Dream, except way creepier.",1197849600,7,1053,5.147058823529412
8049274,1,B0007NFMC6,"It has always been my policy not to throw books or movies away; rather retain them for later use or to give away.  This movie has challenged my policy.  It was a truly horrible movie with no redeeming values.  Even as a dark horror, it lacked substance.  The Internet Movie Database lists this move has a comedy/horror, but I did not see any comedic value to the film.",1148688000,,368,4.367647058823529
8049275,5,B0007NFMC6,"When I first got Dead Doll I was pessimistic. Dead Doll? Cant

they get a better title?

The doll was played by a very pretty model turned actress named remi koch, save for her annoying voice, she is very pretty and

she plays great as a doll (she doesnt move, just lies still)

The movie allows viewers to see that some people have weird fetishes, and even the most successful couple can still have weird

problems that not even medicine can cure.

Overall I think this movie is great if you like a bit of dark comedy and some gore.",1141516800,4,533,4.28
8049276,1,B0007NFMC6,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.  The acting was terrible.  It is a disgusting movie.  It amazes me that good scripts gets overlooked and this piece of trash get distributed.  All the actors need to never ever work in Hollywood again for this disaster a movie, that is if you want to call it that.  Purchasing this movie will be the worst mistake of your entire life.  Thank goodness for movie rental store.",1117324800,4,434,4.3625
8049277,4,B0007NFMC6,"This movie is a parody of all the sex and violence Hollywood pumps out. Dark humor points a finger at the souless worshipping and selling of ""Barbie doll"" beauty in this culture.

 Dead Doll's symbolism depicts crimes against women. Crimes perpetrated by men driven mad with self loathing. Men [and one woman] too weak to control the animal side of their natures.

 Dead Doll makes it's points with intensity!",1116979200,2,409,4.884057971014493
