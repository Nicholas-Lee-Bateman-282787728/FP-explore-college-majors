4620896,5,B0059IR2R2,"This Debate delivers with both positions being stated clearly and effectively. As to a ""Winner"" I believe that Rabbi Tovia Singer was the clear winner in this debate. His energy and scriptural knowledge of the Tanach was evident throughout and although Pastor Paul Humber is himself knowledgeable, Rabbi Singer's responses were unequaled. I am a firm believer that if you want to know why Jews reject Jesus, then you need to go to the Jews to find that out. Go to the source and ask! Both men in this debate cleary hold each other in high regard and this is not directed at Pastor Humber, yet I have seen Jews accosted for the Star Of David around their necks, or the Kippas on their heads, with people yelling at them that they are the killers of Jesus and will burn in hell for eternity, and for many that is all they need to know to hate the Jewish people. In Rabbi Singer's ""Let's get Biblical"" DVD, series he has been known to say, that he wasn't even in the neighborhood, at the time  when Jesus was killed, showing his great sense of humor. But seriously, It's time to change the conversation, and it's time to stop the hate! At [...] you will find Rabbi Singer's web site that is dedicated to bringing Jews back to their Jewish fatih, further teaching what  Jews believe and why. As a matter of fact it has been so that successful that he has coined a phrase, ""Here come the Gentiles"", due to the number of Gentiles that have converted to Judaism, through an Orthodox Conversion. When Hashem's truth is told, it becomes clear which path to follow. I am in all fairness, a long time fan of the Rabbi and do believe that Judaism is the faith to follow and pray that even Pastor Humber comes to that realization. If you really want the truth, then you just might find it where you least expect to. You have nothing to lose, yet everything to gain. Find out what G-d commands for us to do, and if you haven't heard Rabbi Singer before, your in for a treat and a big dose of truth. This Debate is a good starting place, and you can't go wrong buying it! Enjoy!",1310342400,11,2063,4.369791666666667
4620897,5,B0059IR2R2,"I have to give some background on myself before I validate my title... because I have read other lower star reviews who know nothing about Rabbi Tovia Singer.  I used to be a christian... then 9/11 happened and all of a sudden the history channel and other places was filled with Islam, and I started to question where it came from, as I had never really known anything about it.  I started to study my bible again, cover to cover, from beginning to end, and I ran into serious issues when I got to the NT, so I got another bible, read that cover to cover, and the cycle continued through 4 different versions.  I finally decided to find out why the Jews didn't believe in jesus, and to see if I could get some of my questions answered.  That is not an easy thing to do, as Jews are not allowed to proselytize... for good reason... anyway, I stumbled across Tovia Singer, because he is one of few Jews who, in trying to keep their own people from being swayed away from the one true G-d, had free audios that covered all my questions, plus more on his site.  He not only knows the Torah inside and out, he also knows the NT inside and out, and can answer any question... not because he has an opinion, but because he plagiarizes what G-d has to say.... he is NOT a great debater, as some have said, he just repeats what G-d has to say.  And he can tell you why the NT is not the word of G-d using the King James version of the bible... based on what came first... the Torah.  Now, this is a ""debate"" where a pastor tries to convince people that he is right based on feelings, emotions, and fear of going to hell.  Tovia uses the bible to prove all his points, and the pastor can't answer them.  I find that true in all debates between Tovia and pastors.  And once Tovia presents questions that pastors can't answer, they all resort to the same thing...""jesus loves you and if you don't follow him, you are going to burn in hell""  That is not an answer.  So great job Tovia, once again!  And for the person who thinks people are following Tovia like the waco guy... sorry, we don't follow Tovia, we follow the one true G-d... Hashem!  Tovia just points out the fact that people are following the wrong god, and Tovia doesn't ask anyone to follow himself!!",1311811200,4,2254,4.272941176470588
4620898,5,B0059IR2R2,"Every single time I watch Rabbi Singer debate, I can only tell you that we are fortunate to witness such events like these.  Rabbi Singer has made his case so simple and yet so powerful that all of the questions that come mind are answered.  He focuses on the big picture, how scripture is used in proper context, citing parallel verses, and of course, how the original Hebrew words that were translated appear in parallel texts with the correct translations.  And, the best part is that Rabbi Singer only uses the Bible and does not rely on the Talmud or other Jewish sources.

Furthemore, Rabbi Singer says that if the Church taught the Bible in the original Hebrew, everyone would immediately see the truth and walk away from the Church.  It is interesting to note that universal language of all mankind is mathematics.  The original Hebrew is actually a language made of math.  Every letter corresponds to a number so that you can teach a child how to read and count at the same time.  What else could we expect from the Creator of the Universe?  If the original text of the Bible was in Hebrew, then why doesn't the New Testament continue in Hebrew with the numerology like the original?  It is a shame that Rabbi Singer did not have enough time to give further details about this unique language called Hebrew.

I think that Pastor Paul Humber is fine and gentle human being.  However, I see him as a man that accepted Jesus and uses verses from the Bible to find Jesus while ignoring the overall big picture and central message of the Bible.  The nation of Israel is all over the place.  In fact, God calls Israel His firstborn and His servant in so many places that is too numerous to quote.

Although I enjoyed watching this debate, I must say that there was definitely not enough time for both parties.  Rabbi Singer was limited and could have presented so much more.  Therefore, I believe anyone seeking clarity on the Bible can gain a tremendous amount of knowledge by listening to Rabbi Singer's entire lecture series.  He has three parts on alone only on Isaiah 53.  That would be very highly recommended to any truth seeker.",1311724800,5,2139,4.596306068601583
4620899,5,B0059IR2R2,"This debate is a must see for those interested in the Jewish perspective as opposed to the Christian belief system.  Rabbi Tovia Singer expounds upon the Hebrew scriptures (""Old Testament"") both through a historical sense and a Jewish theological point of view.  He is extremely effective in demonstrating how mistranslations of the Hebrew language is very problematic in Christian texts.  These mistranslations have virtually changed scripture from truth to a mirrored fairy tale referred to as ""The New Testament"".  This debate is not for the faint of heart.

4620900,5,B0059IR2R2,"This video gets straight to the action, with no delay in commencing this modern-day disputation between Pastor Paul Humber and Rabbi Tovia Singer on this most controversial topic - ""Is Jesus the promised Jewish Messiah?""
With passion and zeal that hearkens back to Nachmanides in the Disputation of Barcelona, Rabbi Singer stands up for the fundamentals of the Jewish faith by repeatedly referring to the Hebrew Bible without apology. Pastor Humber's emotional appeal that Jesus is calling to the Jewish people to turn to him is consistent throughout the debate.
In the end, Tovia lays bear the root of Protestant Christianity, and offers the very words of Martin Luther to determine if the Christian religion was actually designed to call to the Jews in love, or condemn and persecute them as castaways in preference of the new gospel. Did God change His everlasting covenant with Israel because of Jesus? Did God break His promises and change His eternal word? Can the Jewish Messiah appear, without bringing peace or the messianic age? Is the Messiah God in the flesh? How can it be that the Messiah of the Jews, by his very appearing would condemn the Jews, generally, to hell, instead of saving them? Are animal offerings or a human sacrifice the reason that God forgives sin? These questions are all addressed by Humber and Singer in this DVD.",1311292800,2,1349,4.921052631578948
4620901,5,B0059IR2R2,"My only advice to any person, pastor or lay, who purports to know the Bible and desires to debate with Rabbi Tovia Singer on any biblical issue is, you better think twice.  Rabbi Singer's knowledge of the Holy Scripture is beyond belief.  He quotes the Tanach, chapter and verse, from his intimate knowledge of each one and without a note.

His knowledge is coupled with passion, wisdom, a profound respect for all people, and a love of people which is palpable. Throw in a little Jewish humor and you have a truly entertaining event.

Although Pastor Humber no doubt knows Scripture, his presentation, by comparison to Rabbi Singer, was dry, boring, and impotent.  He seemed flustered and even embarrassed at times.  His attempt at an old-fashioned altar call towards the end of the debate was disrespectful of his surroundings, to say the very least.

If you need a ""winner"" or a ""loser"", Rabbi Singer is clearly the winner and I actually felt a little bit sorry for Pastor Paul.  All in all, a very entertaining and educational experience.",1311033600,5,1042,4.814606741573034
4620902,5,B0059IR2R2,"Very insightful, fair, balanced and even entertaining. Both parties are very knowledgeable, however, Rabbi Tovia singer is the champion of this debate. The truth is, this debate was won by Rabbi Tovia before it even started. He overcame all of Pastor Paul's objections in previous debates with other pastors. Rabbi Tovia doesn't just provide a single proof that supports his stand in every argument but rather an overwhelming amount of info that leaves no room for doubt of what the truth is. My wife and I were very entertained by the Rabbi's enthusiasm, sense of humor and drive. This dvd should be watched by all Christians and Jews. Sadly, most Christians wouldn't dare touch it in fear that it may cause them to question the legitimacy of their faith.",1310947200,2,756,4.868217054263566
4620903,4,B0059IR2R2,"I watched the DVD today, 7/16/11 and give it a 4. The main reason I did not give it a 5 is that the advertising picture is misleading. It suggests that Tovia and I were perhaps yelling or scolding one another, but you can see if you watch the video itself, Tovia and I are not looking at one another and shaking fingers or fists.

The other disappointing aspect was the long denunciation of Martin Luther at the end. Admittedly, this was  apparently asked as a question, but it seems off-topic. The debate was about the Messiah and Jesus - not about Martin Luther.

The observer will also note that Tovia always had the last word. Even though I would have preferred more of a chiastic format, I yielded to Tovia's wishes and agreed to begin each section with him responding.

Let me offer a ""final word"" here concerning just one matter -- my expressed view that ""son"" is a good translation for ""bar"" in Psalm 2. There are several reasons for this. First, ""bar"" is translated three times as son in Proverbs 31:2. There does not seem to be any disagreement about ""bar"" meaning ""son"" in that verse. If ""bar"" can be translated as ""son"" in the Proverbs, why not the Psalms?

Second, ""bar mitzvah"" uses ""bar"" for ""son,"" and this is a common Jewish expression even today. Thus, ""bar"" is an alternate form for ""son.""

Third, Psalm 2:7 certainly is talking about ""son"" in that passage; the word is ""ben."" Why would David use a different word in the same psalm - just a few verses later?

Notice the context. Psalm 2:8-11 says, ""Ask of Me, and I will make the nations Your heritage, and the ends of the earth Your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.""

Perhaps ""bar,"" has a more international flavor than ""ben."" Apparently also Delitzsch suggested that the sequence, ""bar pen"" (Son, lest) ""avoids the dissonance of ben pen."" We do something similar today in English. We say ""an aunt"" rather than ""a aunt"" because it sounds better.

Finally, even some Jewish scholars have allowed the translation, ""bar"" as ""son."" For example, Ibn Ezra (12th c.) seems to favor the ""son"" reading, viewing it as referring to Israel. David Kimchi (13th c.) contemplated both renderings: ""If we adopt the reading son, then the sense will be, 'kiss the son whom God hath called a son,' saying, 'Thou art my son;' and the verb must be explained by the custom of slaves kissing the hand of their masters. But if we adopt the reading pure, it means, 'What have I to do with you? for I am pure of heart, and there is no iniquity in me that you should come and fight against me; but it is your part to kiss me and to confess that I am king by the ordinance of God.'""

Isaac Leeser translated it as ""Do homage to the son"" (cf. Isaac Leeser, Twenty-Four Books of the Holy Scriptures Carefully Translated After the Best Jewish Authorities (New York: Hebrew Publishing Company). ""Leeser's translation was the standard American Jewish translation from 1845 until the Jewish Publication Society translation of 1917.""

Even if the word is rendered with ""pure,"" however, the ""son"" of verse 7 is still in view. He would be viewed as the ""Pure One."" David was not ""pure."" Israel was not ""pure."" Messiah Jesus was and is ""Pure."" In either case, we should humble ourselves before the Pure Son of God, Messiah Jesus.

4620904,5,B0059IR2R2,"Pastor Humbert relied on millennia-old translations to present his case, translations which have been corrected in some of the latest Christian bibles.

Several years ago, Rabbi Singer challenged his radio listeners to learn Hebrew and find out for themselves what the Hebrew scriptures really say and have said for over three thousand years.  I took that challenge and did learn for myself that the bible I was raised with is faulty (I am being generous).  To paraphrase the rabbi ""I left skidmarks in the parking lot"" of the church.

I've studied, in Hebrew, all the 'proof' texts given by the pastor, and it was embarrassing to watch him use these false translations to support his views.

Therefore, I'd like to pass along Tovia's challenge to others, including the good Pastor Humbert.  Learn Hebrew - no excuses anymore to accept blindly what has been taught for 2000 years.",1310601600,6,880,4.9523809523809526

Rabbi Singers' ""preaching"" style comes off like a Southern Baptist preacher who is ""on fire for the Lord"" while Pastor Humbers' presentation is very monotone and in my opinion boring.

8462984,4,B0059IR2R2,"I only gave this four stars, despite the stellar presentation by Pastor Paul Humber, because whether you are a Jew or Christian I think you will be saddened to witness this debacle. Here is my letter to the participants to explain why I say this:

Pastor Paul,

I could hardly bear to watch you destroy rabbi Singer in your debate. You spoke with great dignity respect and authority.

rabbi Singer has become an obscenely obese monstrosity and caricature of a Jew and human being. It is not surprising given that Judaism is the only religion on earth whose core identity is to deny and negate the identity of Jesus of Nazareth as Divine Messiah and God-Man. Only the gravest deterioration and degeneration can mar those who embark on such an unfortunate course of denying the root of their own souls!

I felt no delight watching rabbi Singer fumble for a coherent response to your presentation. I felt pity to witness a prominent representative of anti-Messianic Judaism display such blindness of heart and stubbornness of mind.

I can only wonder if rabbi Singer is eating himself to death due to guilt for writing to me back in 2003 when I lived in South Africa ""Psak halacha [Jewish legal ruling]: it is preferable for you to commit suicide than to believe in Jesus!""

If the rabbi is consumed with guilt leading him to over-consume victuals, then I offer to him my sincerest forgiveness. When I was an ultra-Orthodox Jew I too harbored fanatical hatred of Christians, and indeed I never would have agreed to appear on a stage with someone like Paul Humber at all! I forgive him and pray his sanity will return. We all would prefer that he live long enough to recant of his hatred of Jesus rather than die a premature death due to diabetes or coronary infarction.

To Pastor Humber I offer the following piece of advice. Since you appear to be on friendly and respectful terms with Jewish people, perhaps you are ideally positioned to help find a solution to this problem. The main problem for Jews is not whether Jesus is Messiah. The problem rather is cultural: what will happen to their Jewish identity and practices if they affirm that Jesus is Messiah! This is the question that grips their hearts and vexes their spirits. After many years of evangelizing to Jews, I do not think it is sufficient to simply do a ""hit and run"" by shoving Jesus in their faces. You need to have a church or congregation to shepherd them into, and a pathway of devotion to direct them to. If you are unable to do this, then perhaps it is a mistake to witness to them at all. It would be like telling someone they live in a rotten family under abusive parents, without offering them a healthy alternative. Is that genuine Christian compassion?",1378771200,2,2730,4.6397515527950315
8462985,4,B0059IR2R2,"The debates were engaging, courteous, and I would even say friendly between two intelligent, well-meaning, Bible-literate theologians, and the master of ceremonies and audience provided a warm and, I felt, genuinely hospitable atmosphere.

Some of the issues - the Trinity, for example - probably aren't going to be agreed upon by everyone until the Lord Himself steps down from heaven and tells us all: ""Look, it's like this...,"" but the debaters did a good job in getting both viewpoints out. I thought, however, that Rabbi Tovia spent too much time arguing against ""the church"" (whatever that means - there are over 200 denominations just in the U.S. alone) and not enough time on the issues.

Rabbi Tovia stated that Pastor Paul's Trinity proof verses were actually G-d either speaking in the plural of majesty or speaking to the angels.

However, if He was speaking to the angels when He said ""Let us make man in our own image"" (Gen. 32:30), why did He include them as co-creators when they are only creatures themselves and incapable of creating anyone else? And, if He was using the plural of majesty, where are examples of other biblical kings using this form?  The rest of them - even the pompous Nebuchadnezzar - all spoke in first person singular, probably because the royal plural wasn't even invented until the Middle Ages ([...]).

Although Rabbi Tovia countered some statements head-on, his explanation for the ""Angel of the Lord"" verses raises more questions than it answers.

If the ""man"" Jacob wrestled with in Gen. 32:30 was only a messenger representing G-d, why did Jacob say that he had ""seen G-d face to face"" (i.e., not through a representative) and think it worth emphasizing that he (Jacob) had survived the encounter?

If only a messenger representing G-d was in the burning bush in Ex. 3:5, why did Moses hide his face because he was ""afraid to look upon G-d""? Wouldn't he just have seen the messenger?

The only reasonable answer - and we do serve a G-d of reason - has to be that the Lord and the ""Angel of the Lord"" are one and the same.

Rabbi Tovia's final statement consisted almost entirely of an attack on Martin Luther, who up to that point hadn't even been part of the discussion. Can someone explain to me what the ramblings of a sinful European clergyman 1,500 years after the fact have to do with whether or not Yeshua is the prophesied Messiah?

Pastor Paul Humber apparently didn't feel the need to drag in distractions and irrelevancies, though; he just stuck to the topics of the debates - and more than won them.",1313884800,7,2558,4.740990990990991
8462986,4,B0059IR2R2,"I am a native of the Congo (Brazzaville), a country situated in Central Africa; I attended the debate held by Rabbi Tovia Singer and the Lord's servant Pastor Paul Humber of the Church of the Living Saviour located in Philadelphia. Actually, if you watch the debate DVD, you will easily notice me because I am prominent.

Right at the beginning, I find it important to say that Rabbi Singer is a very nice man. He has a great knowledge of the Torah; I am appreciative of that, but when it comes to the prophecies related to Jesus as the Messiah who was to come' he really needs some light because he does not have the right revelation. Jesus as the Messiah is the quintessence of the Old Testament. It was a good thing to listen to him because he helped me discover more and more the Jewish people's way of thinking and helped me know how to minister to them.

I want to call your attention to the fact that the applause of the Jews each time that Tovia Singer spoke are misleading and do not mean that Rabbi Tovia Singer was the winner. The winner was obviously Paul Humber who said significant things. The Bible references and the explanations that he brought up were clear and convincing. The debate was held in a Jewish center, and not many Christians were aware of the debate. So, in the debate room, the Jews outnumbered Christians; this is the reason why the applause was big each time that Rabbi Singer spoke. I regretted the fact that Christians were not numerous in that room as they weren't aware.

The Jews argue that Rabbi Tovia Singer is knowledgeable as he could quote some passages of the Tanach from memory. They rejoice themselves over this and just because of that, they thought that Singer is right. I saw nothing impressive in that. Actually, Pastor Paul Humber, whom I know well, and other Christians can quote a lot of Bible passages from Genesis to Revelation from memory. Rabbi Tovia Singer is not special in that.

Rabbi Singer went on to argue that when God declared in Genesis, ""Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,"" (Genesis 1:26) He was speaking to his angels. I disagree with him because the angels are not God, and God could not speak to them as if they were creators. Angels are creatures and not Creators like God. God could just speak to the One who was equal to Himself, the Lord Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, as Paul Humber rightfully defended.

I deplored the fact that from the beginning of the debate to the end of it, every time Rabbi Tovia Singer was the one who had the last word. You know, the one who has the last word in a debate can easily gather facts to provide for answers.
Also, Pastor Humber's explanations about some passages were great and clear, and Rabbi Singer would then speak in terms of what he would call mistranslations in the Bible.

Pastor Humber made it clear that the Jewish people as well as the Gentiles (the non-Jews) must receive Jesus as their Savior in order to be saved. He went on to indicate that the Lord Jesus saves anybody who submits to His will including Egyptians. God chose the Jewish people to bring the Savior of the world unto earth; this is a great blessing. God as well as the Gentiles love the Jewish people, but now there is equality between Jews and the Gentiles. They all need to receive Jesus as their Lord and Savior in order for them to go to heaven.

Brother Paul Humber was sent there as an instrument of God to open the spiritual eyes of the Jews who attended the debate and those who would watch the debate DVD later, starting with Rabbi Tovia Singer, one of their spiritual leaders. Pastor Humber made it clear that both Rabbi Tovia Singer and he are sinners and that they both need to accept the Lord Jesus as their Savior to be saved. From my readings, I know that some Jews have already received Jesus as the Savior of their lives; among them is Richard Wurmbrand from Romania, the author of Tortured for Christ (1967) and the founder of The Voice of the Martyrs and also Michael L. Brown who authored Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus (2000). Personally as a Christian, I regularly pray for the conversion of Rabbi Tovia Singer and of all the Jews to Christianity.

This debate reminded me of the days of the Lord Jesus on this earth. I saw the attitude and the picture of Jesus in Pastor Paul Humber and the attitude and the picture of the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Scribes in Rabbi Tovia Singer. I like the fact that Rabbi Singer is fully dedicated to bringing spiritual teachings to the Jews and Gentiles; I appreciate his dedication, but he has to adjust, accept Christ and use that dedication to preach Jesus to the Jews and the Gentiles as well. The day he will accept Christ and preach Him, I believe that he will be a great preacher, a preacher of distinction.
At last I should say that the debate was great and would recommend Christians to watch the DVD to discover the weak reasons that the Jewish people present to reject the Savior of the world. This would enable them to minister efficiently to Brother and Father Abraham's natural descendents. The images are good as well as the sounds, excepting the fact that on the front cover, the picture gives the impression that Pastor Paul Humber and Rabbi Tovia Singer were scolding each other during the debate. Their pictures are great but they should not have been placed face to face. I gave it four stars.

God bless you richly Brother Paul G. Humber. Go ahead in God's work, HE is with you through Jesus Christ, our precious Lord and Savior. God also bless Rabbi Tovia Singer and all the Jews with the understanding that Jesus is their only Messiah.  Christians were not born Christian; they become Christian. The non-messianic Jews may become Christians and be our brothers and sisters in the family of God. We Christians are not against the Jews; we do like them; we pray for their salvation; they are Abraham's natural descendents; but they need to become Abraham's spiritual children like the Christians by giving their lives to Jesus, considering HIM their Lord and Savior.",1313366400,18,6071,4.556370302474794
8462987,5,B0059IR2R2,Another great product and debate. Rabbi Singer clearly wins with truth and accurace of knowledge of the tanach and the christian text. With out a doubt Judaism is true and right. And Christianity needs to stop corrupting the scripture and the original Hebrew.  Baruch HaShem for Tovia!!!,1313020800,4,287,5.1063829787234045
8462988,4,B0059IR2R2,"Saying nothing about who ""won"" the debate I will mention only that the DVD picture quality is very good. The sound leaves something to be desired as it sometimes comes from two or more microphones and will vary in volume as the video editor selected one mic over another. However, the voices are quite understandable and these annoyances are only minor.

The debate was skewed in favor of Rabbi Singer as it took place in a Jewish center with (I am guessing) a mostly Jewish audience. Further, Pastor Humber always made his arguments first and Singer then the reply. The question and answer period was very short, at least on the DVD, with only about 4 questions being asked. Here again, Singer made replies to Humber's answers. The last question brought an uncalled for lengthy reading by Singer of Martin Luther's  anti-Semitic writing. Simply mentioning the writing would have been sufficient.

Both Singer and Humber digressed a bit from the debating mode into personal beliefs. Singer with his acclimation of the One God and ""his"" Hebrew Bible and taking uncalled for pop-shots at Christianity which went over well with the Jewish audience and Humber falling into a preacher mode calling for one to accept the blood sacrifice of  Christ.

I was a bit surprised that Humber was not more prepared for the response the rabbi made as Singer has posted a series of MP3 files covering almost all of the topics covered in the debate.

I gave this 4 stars and not 5 because of the minor sound problem, the lack of questions and answers and the manner in which the question period was handled. Overall, if you are interested in the way Jews deal with scripture Christian's use to support Jesus in the Old Testament this is an excellent source.",1311984000,3,1739,4.760797342192691

One does not get to know their soul purpose via intellect. It comes in a quiet contemplation and attention to those who have known the ONE TRUE G-d for millenia!

Excellent debate. Cannot wait to share this with others.",1311811200,4,457,4.7125
8462990,5,B0059IR2R2,"Once there was a Rabbi who was knowledgable enough and willing to debate a scholar non jew of his time as to why the Jews do not beleive Jesus is the Messiah.  He was Nachmanides. Today, we have Rabbi Tovia Singer.  This DVD is an important step in the dialouge with the non Jewish world.  Amid the grey, wavy lines of today's Eccumenicalism stands the straight and clear cut words of the Jewish Bible, delivered by Rabbi Singer. This DVD is a must see !",1311811200,5,454,4.317647058823529
