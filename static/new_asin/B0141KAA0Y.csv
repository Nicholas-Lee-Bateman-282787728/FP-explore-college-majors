8741291,3,B0141KAA0Y,"Child of privilege and dilettante wanderer lives a life of many parts. Friend of the pro Nazi Prince of Wales, the Mitford Sisters, Guy Burgess the spy, goes lightly thru his own life. Pro Nazi, pro communist, and in the end a British commando. This is a very English story. Writer,Oxford flunker, poet, decorated WW2 officer, and gay married man. His life covered alot of territory. I know nothing about his poetry- writing ability. It was all long ago. Why he received the MC is not covered in depth. He was later imprisoned in Colditz Castle. During the  St. Nazaire raid he commanded 26 men of whom 14 were killed. He was pulled out of the dri nk by one of his men, wounded he hid for a while, and then was captured. The mission was accomplished but the Navy should get the credit for that. Perhaps I will look deeper into his part. I think he was decorated because his connections were so influential.",1536710400,,906,4.490909090909091
