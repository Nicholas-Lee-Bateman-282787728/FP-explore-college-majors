After the first viewing I felt a shock, it woke me up to how I was just going through my day.  I called it my zone, but I discovered that is was my ""zone out.""  GET this video if you want to wake up.  GET this if you want to see how many others are really asleep.  You'll discover so much more, when you are awake.  Twenty really lays it out there with very little psycho babble.  Its not a magic pill, just a way to wake up and feel alive.  And to play a little bit while you are there.  Enjoy, I recommend it for managers, teachers, and especially parents.  Parents really need to be awake and notice.",1262908800,,772,3.9934210526315788
8223411,5,B000WH8R9M,"I remember when I first got this movie.  I don't think I made it through the first half when I was hooked.  I ran out and got my housemate.  He was also quite amazed and a little intimidated.

The dirt:  In this video, Wingert craftily demonstrates the method of handshake induction as per Mr. Milton Erikson.  This is it.  It's real.  It's a good demo.  The guy does it for you right then and there.  You get to see it.  He shows you how.  Dozens of times.

The scoop: Even cooler is his method of training.  He'll gladly teach you to do the exact same thing.  You can pay attention to the video and then get on his group and ask questions.  Even go and see him for training.  It's real.  Learn it.  For real.

The best part:  We're not talking some nonsensical hypertheoretical ebook here or something.  Just a guy doing something in a garage or a basement or someplace in front of a pleasant blue wall.  It's straight street level actual stuff.  No fancy hokum, just the real deal.  Something you could do too.

If I wanted to learn to do this again, I would buy this video, precisely.  As I recall, there's some nifty little side bits that are offshoots from the tree of handshake interrupts...  basically things that work in similar ways.  And I've been around hypnotists who thought that if they cut me off while I was talking, that would be a sufficient interrupt.  You won't have any of that nonsense here.  The best part is that Mr. JW pulls it all off whilst being a very nice guy.",1260316800,,1491,4.3321167883211675
