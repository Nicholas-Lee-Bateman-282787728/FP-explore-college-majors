The DVD has 5 Halloween episodes and 5 bonus episodes, so look--you don't have to fork over 30 bucks for 12 episodes, just fork over 15 bucks for 10! Also, the next Spongebob DVD has been announced for Nov 5 release--it's called Sea Stories, and will also contain 10 episodes.

1726409,5,B000068TSQ,"You know how some episodic DVDs creep up on you one episode at a time, and some gather all their episodes and hit you like a fist? Well, not only did SpongeBob SquarePants Halloween hit me like a fist, but it also burst through the ceiling of all expectations (funny and absurd) to emerge as my all time fave SpongeBob DVD!!!!! (Until the next one.)
But seeing as I only have practically 90 episodes to go until I've seen all, that's no big surprise. But as Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost would moan, ""Enoooough! Listen uuuupp......""

Scaredy Pants.
It's Halloween in Bikini Bottom, and SpongeBob has quite simply had enough of everybody scaring him. Now it's his turn for a pay back! And what better to be than a round ghost imitation of the Flying Dutchman in clogs? (Even though Squidward's pirate wear looks more realistic.) But he just isn't scaring anybody. Maybe a visit from the real Dutchman would be in order? The ending is hilarious, so all in all a good ep. - 8 outta 10.

Imitation Krabs.
SpongeBob's on constant lookout for Plankton and his schemes to steal the formula. So when he gets Squidward and Krabs out of the way (a day off and a rolling penny) and steps into a robo Krabs (reminds one of Krab Borg in a way), it's all the more confusing for the perky fry cook. Maybe 6 and a half hours of constant testing should be enough to wear the fake Krabs down... or is it? Kind of grows on ya. ""Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt."" - 8 outta 10.

Franken Doodle.
When a giant pencil falls into Bikini Bottom, naturally SpongeBob and Patrick are very enthusiastic. They manage to have a lot of fun with that pencil (Squidward even gets hair!!!!!!!) until the dreaded Sponge Doodle is drawn. He and the pencil now wreak havoc around Bikini Bottom. Will SpongeBob live to tell the tale, or will he meet the sharp (or worse, rounded rubber) end of the evil magic pencil? Sponge Doodle's language is vulgar, so I couldn't understand half of it. But still pretty good. - 7 outta 10.

I Was a Teenage Gary.
Squidward's ""volunteered"" to watch Gary for SpongeBob while he goes to a jelly fishing convention with Patrick for a long weekend. But 3 days of neglect is too much for the poor pet. So SpongeBob's shocked to walk in and find Gary half-dead. Squidward has to give Gary a shot with snail serum (the doc's too squeamish), but due to SpongeBob's carelessness, pricks him on the nose. Eventually, another snail is added to the populace... or even 2 if Squidward has anything to do with it? Catch the hilarious ""mew the miaw miaow"" ending. Meoooow, meooow, meow meow-meow meow... - 9 outta 10.

Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost.
Accidentally straying from an active game outside, a throwing shell accidentally lodges into the head of a wax Squidward (apparently it helps conquer all artistic media). Poor SpongeBob and Patrick do everything they can to save it, but to no avail. The problem is, they think it's the real Squidward, so they're shocked when a white (real) Squidward emerges from the bathroom. Now this is either time to evacuate the town... or for Squidward to have a little revenge on the uptake... if you know what I mean. A fantastic episode. Squid, can't get enough of him! - 10 outta 10.

The Secret Box.
It's small. It's a box. It's a small box. But inside is the Best Secret Ever! And SpongeBob will go to any lengths to get it. Even sneak under Patrick's rock. It may ruin a friendship they've had for such a long time and even made a Best Friends Forever club ring for, but he'll do it. I mean, what if it's an embarrassing snapshot of him at the Christmas party? Suspenseful, but not so much it kills me. - 7 outta 10.

Band Geeks.
Let's face it, Squidward's kinda always had a dream to be a world famous musician. So he isn't likely to pass up a chance to perform, at the Bubble Bowl, with his arch rival from high school and band class Squilliam Fancyson watching, in a hurry. The problem? He doesn't have a band. So he recruits everyone in Bikini Bottom at short notice. Will the band flop and crush Squidward's one chance of happiness into little tiny bite-size pieces, or will it be a sweet sweet victory? Genius. Pure genius. Addicted from first watch. - 20 outta 10 (I tried to make the rating meter bigger, it was that good!)

Welcome to the Chum Bucket.
When it comes to cards, Mr Krab's always taken Plankton to the cleaners. But one unlucky slip means that he lost the one thing that matters... SpongeBob's contract. A devastated SpongeBob is transported to the Chum Bucket, but won't make a single patty. Not even after an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen, vibrating slippers, a pony ride, a bedtime story... Touching in the end. - 8 outta 10.

My Pretty Seahorse.
SpongeBob likes spring. Understatement. So you can believe his luck when he finds and tames a wild seahorse he calls Mystery. (Well, it was Mystery, Grace or Debbie.) But as it turns out, the Krusty Krab is no place for bucking broncos that eat every thing in sight. So it's either hide Mystery in the kitchen, or CowBob RanchPants gets fired! Once again, a touching episode, but only due to the bowl of onions on the desk. - 8 outta 10.

The Idiot Box.
Normally when it comes to ordering stuff, you play with the thing inside and throw away the outside. But in SpongeBob and Patrick's case, they throw away the inside, a brand new screen TV, and play in the outside, a box. Squidward is not amused or interested... until an avalanche starts in the middle of the box! How do they make all these sound effects? Is it the (makes rainbow shape with hands) imaaaaaginaaaationnnnnnnnnnn or perhaps, something more? Only one way for Squidward to find out... Totally funny, too cool, and if you don't find the racing car ending hilarious, you really haven't lived! - 10 outta 10.

Wait, I'm getting something...
Yeah. Apparently, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He has decided to spare ye a horrible fate if ye really don't like SpongeBob. (sssssssssssssssssissssss.)
So at least try this DVD out, and if ye do not liketh it, there is an alternative. All you must do is tend to my every whim, and tickle my fancy on command...
Now get this DVD. Now. Or thou shalt unleash the horrible wrath of Squiiiiidwaaaard........
(I think they make a cream for that now.)",1127001600,26,6289,4.566489361702128
1726420,5,B000068TSQ,"This Halloween compilation features 10 episodes each from season 1,2 & 3. A good selection of hilarious and scary episodes. Here they are:

1726421,3,B000068TSQ,"First of all, understand that the content itself is 5 stars easy...it's Spongebob!  The 3 stars is simply because these collections aren't as cool as the Season sets.  The second release in the continuous line of Spongebob ""themed"" (compilation) DVDs, Halloween, includes 10 episodes that draw almost evenly from all three seasons of this awesome show.  There's only one episode here actually set on Halloween (""Scaredy Pants""), but some of the others do have a related theme.  For example, ""Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost"" and ""I was a Teenage Gary"".  Not to mention there's the hilarious ""Band Geeks"" and not one but two episodes featuring Plankton, which is always good.  As I said it's not the content, it's the representation.  Considering all of these episodes will be available on the Season sets I have to recommend that be the way you get them.  The ""Halloween"" DVD offers 3 episodes from Season 1, 3 from Season 2, and 4 from Season 3.  For a casual fan wanting a good taste of some choice Spongebob, I would say pick it up, but for us Bikini Bottom loyalists and wanna be residents, the complete Season box sets are the only way to swim!

Every episode is like a peice of gold to me.theyre just so hilarious. For 15 bucks on Amazon its a good deal to almost cry because of laughter. I love Frankendoodle where spongebob and his permanantly drunk/crazy drawing sword fight with pencils. And at the end of Band Geeks, where spongebob is singing i practically choked because it was so funny. my 5 year old sister brother dad and mom crack up whenever they watch spongebob. That's why my dad bought himself the whole first season dvd which I recommend. I don't see how I could write such a big review for 10 episodes....because its worth it of course.

In Imitation Crabs, Plankton is trying hard to get the secret crabby patty formula and targets spongebob by dressing up in a variety of different outfits, the last of which is a metal Mr. Krabs getup. Frankendoodle is hilarious as spongebob and patrick come upon a magic pencil and find that everything they draw comes to life but when they try to play a trick on squidward things go terribly wrong. The first double length episode Spongebob Scaredypants is top-notch as well as spongebob tries to be scary by dressing up as the flying dutchman. I was a Teenage Gary is really good too as spongebob goes through some ""changes"" that are down right hilarious. All in all, this is a DVD that any self respecting spongebob fan should have in their collection. Highly Recommended. P.S.

Don't expect this to be an educational show but rather something to laugh to if you're down or just feel like chuckling at some stupid, mindless jokes... I've been addicted to this show for quite some time now but had never seen a halloween episode before, so the second that I saw this on video I snatched it up and bought it as quickly as I could. And while all of these episodes are great, I was rather disappointed at my realization of how the newer DVD version had 5 extra episodes and how only one of the episodes was an actual halloween one!
I absolutely love watching Spongebob Squarepants (especially when the evil Plankton is present) but I've honestly seen funnier ones than these before.

Scoring:
5 Stars: Kids - They love Sponge Bob and all his quirky friends!
5 Stars Parents - Shows are good wholesome fun.
4 Stars Violence - minimal violence, but lots of slapstick
2 Stars Educational - Won't get that here!
Recommendation:
Get It!
My kids (and many other kids) really love all the Sponge Bob shows.  I cannot think of a single one that was not a big hit!
Summary:
""Sponge Bob"" is a lovable, fun loving sponge who gets into ridiculous situations with his less than dumb best friend ""Patrick Star"" (starfish) in their hometown of ""Bikini Bottom"".
The (10) Halloween Shows start out with the loveable Sponge Bob who is afraid of everything on Halloween, but, can't scare anybody!  The shows get funnier and funnier from there!

I think Sponge Bob is much better slapstick than the ""Bugs Bunny"", or ""Tom and Jerry""  that we grew up with because the humor is more clever situational comedy, and relies less on someone getting ""pulverized""!  The scenery is colorful and detailed, yet comical; the dialogue is funny and clever; and the characters are... well... characters!
The DVD is a good buy with the added features also; but those extra features will not drive the DVD purchase alone.  So, the VHS is also a viable purchase.
Other Characters:
Adding to the mix are a bunch of real characters like:
""Gary"", Sponge Bob's pet snail that purrs like a cat;
""Sandy Cheeks"", a happy and sociable squirrel who lives under water;
""Mr. Crabs"", the money hungry owner of the Crusty Crab;
""Squidward"", Sponge Bob's art loving, boring, nasal neighbor who despises Sponge Bob's ridiculous antics;
""Plankton"", the tiny loud mouthed, one-eyed, single celled, megalomaniac who tries to steal Mr. Crab's crabby patty ""secret recipe"".
Scare Factor:
None, except that you and your kids might become addicted!
Violence:
Much better than the Bugs Bunny antics we grew up on; the characters show minimal violence towards each other, but enthrall themselves in their hilarious comedic situations.

1726443,4,B000068TSQ,"My family loves Halloween and especially Halloween specials. So we pre-ordered this one. It's a great DVD packed with 10 great episodes -- some are aboslutely hilarious. But buyers should note that there's only one truly Halloween-themed episode. The other 4 are loosely ""spooky-themed"" (i.e. monsters, robots, etc.). True, it's labeled as ""Spooky Sea Tales"" but the huge Halloween type and pumpkin image can be misleading. Nonethless, is this DVD worth it? YES. The extra 5 episodes make it even more of a value. Should you buy it? YES! Is it funny? YES!! This is SpongeBob at his best! Enough reading. Go buy and enjoy.",1033948800,19,621,4.923809523809524

1726446,3,B000068TSQ,"The 3 stars are only for episode content alone. The rest of the dvd doesn't rate.
This particular dvd release seems hastily slapped together just to cash in on the SpongeBob craze sweeping the nation. The ""extras"" are little more than an advertisement for a video game(!), a slapdash music video for ""SpongeBob ScaredyPants"" and a set of Credits (would you consider Credits to be an extra??).
I'm pleased with the episode selection, but really wanted more. I guess I shouldn't compare it to the last dvd release (chok full of goodies galore!!).",1031097600,6,544,4.860215053763441
