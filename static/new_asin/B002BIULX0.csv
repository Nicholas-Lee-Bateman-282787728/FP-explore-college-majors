8361441,5,B002BIULX0,"This is the first DVD of Emilio that I have owned. It is just awesome!!! If you like this kind of music you will love it. The songs are great as are the musicians. My favorite besides Emilio is Pete YBarra on his accordian.

I own Selena CDs and DVDs so I already knew that I love the music.

Emilio is gone now never to sing again. That is a very big loss to all his fans Selena and Emilio were the very best of Tejano.",1520899200,,420,3.872093023255814
