8081276,5,B000B1DSR0,"Terry White's Mac OS X Training for Windows Users is superb.  It is a must for any new Mac owner, and has much to offer the experienced Mac user as well.  Terry clearly demonstrates how to get around the new operating system, with actual monitor video demonstrations,  and his illustrations are easy to understand.  The DVD makes it easy to stop and then return where you left off.  While the Mac's OS is very intuitive, and you CAN just start it up and go, this easy training DVD will greatly enhance your enjoyment and navigation around your new computer.",1174521600,4,557,4.585858585858586
