5461811,4,B00ANVX6DY,"I'm an animator. Not a child or parent.

I was surprised that this was actually good. The commercials looked silly and were playing into the whole ""princess"" thing.

While Sofia is a princess, it's just as much about her being a princess as it is being accepted into a new family. She doesn't have an evil step-dad, but a step-dad who wants to include her into his family and help her succeed. Her new step brother and sister think she is encroaching on the family, so they try to make fun of her. But she tries her best to become friends with her new family.

From a production stand point, it's also good. Some of the animation and textures get wonky at times. Over all it's grade A animation for TV. They did a GREAT job making Cinderella in 3D. It's not odd to see her in 3D at all.",1361404800,11,786,4.226666666666667
5461812,5,B00ANVX6DY,"It is wonderful that Disney created a movie with the little ones in mind and made sure it is gentle and non -scary.
My daughters are fascinated with new princess. I already spent a little fortune for Sofia's costumes, tiaras and amulets. I feel lucky I did as their sizes are already gone from the market.

Sofia's stories are amazingly gentle and they are so easy to absorb for the little ones. I am curious how they will put them on the DVD, I expect it will be the collection. If you are not srue aobut the story go to the bookstore or buy on amazon inexpensive golden books on Sofia and read with yoru child or by yourself and check what you think of the story.",1361318400,4,665,4.2362204724409445
5461813,5,B00ANVX6DY,"Granddaughter really took to Princess Sofia better than all Princesses before Her.  We have watched the movie over, over and over again, glad DVDs were invented, VHS never would have lasted.  Hope Princess Sofia stays around for years to come.",1358640000,29,243,5.05
5461814,5,B00ANVX6DY,"My two daughters (ages 3 and 5) really love the new Sofia The First: Once Upon a Princess TV Movie that came out on Disney Channel at the end of 2012. It is a cute story with cute characters. I would say it is geared towards younger, Disney Junior age kids due to the simple story and ages of the main characters.  The story introduces the King and new Queen (Sofia's mother), Sofia and her new Stepbrother and Stepsister, the Fairies who teach at Royal Prep Academy (Sofia's new school), the Castle Sorcerer (the bumbling bad guy), and several other characters.  There is minor, Disney style conflict with the new stepsister and the castle sorcerer which gives the story a great plot. Cinderella even makes an appearance to help the newest Disney Princess.

My girls have watched this movie over and over since it came out and quickly memorized all the songs. They would sing along with the TV Movie and would wander around the house singing the songs all the time.  We have already bought the MP3 Music Soundtrack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sofia-the-First-Once-Upon-a-Princess/dp/B00AAQWR7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess</a>) and the Hardcover Storybook (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sofia-the-First/dp/1423169867/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sofia the First</a>) already available on Amazon, which I also highly recommend.

The regular TV Series premiers on the Disney Channel on January 11, 2013 and this is a must have introduction to the Sofia characters and universe.  I know my girls are really looking forward to the show.  Don't miss it.

=========================

QUICK UPDATE (01/21/2013):
Well the TV Series came out a couple of weeks ago and two episodes in, it is a huge hit in our house.  My girls look forward to a new episode every Friday.  My wife made a big production for the premier episode.  She made a whole evening of it with a princess inspired dinner followed by dressing up and painting the Girls' nails before watching the show together.  It is really great having a princess TV Series for the girls to watch and look forward to.  Great show, and this DVD is a must have for the collection.",1357257600,63,2239,5.323863636363637

5461855,5,B00ANVX6DY,For those uninitiated Sofia the First is the story of a girl who becomes a princess when her mom marries the King. This is the introduction movie to the series. Its a very sweet story of her struggles of fitting into her new life and role as a princess while she struggles to hold on to her past. My daughter loves this series and we purchased this movie for her to watch while we went on a long car trip. I am very pleased with the purchase. The movie has been watched a number of times and she never tires of it. She dances around and sings to the songs and truly loves it. Great purchase and highly recommended.,1461715200,4,614,4.168067226890757
5461856,5,B00ANVX6DY,"This movie begins the story of Sofia The First and how she came to be a princess. The Disney Company has come a long way and this particular movie attempts to atone for the negative stigma about step-families Disney created decades ago. Cinderella even comes to Sofia in the movie and admits that her step sisters felt threatened and jealous, like many step siblings. Cinderella admits that she could have handled the situation much better, she's sad that she never became ""true sisters"" with her step sisters, and she warns Sofia not to repeat the mistake with her own stepsister. For my family this movie was a must since my 3 year old is a full blown Sofia addict! As an added bonus we are also a blended family with step parents, step siblings, and half siblings.",1460937600,4,767,4.605839416058394

5461895,5,B00ANVX6DY,My grandkids got hooked on the Sofia the First tv series on Netflix.  The only problem was the series doesn't tell you how Sofia became a princess.  So I ordered this movie so they could see the story of how it all began.  They loved it.,1441411200,3,237,4.108695652173913
5461896,3,B00ANVX6DY,"This is a review written by a normal adult who happens to have an almost-four year old daughter who loves Sofia. Is Sofia horrible?  Not really--in fact, she is a pretty nice and humble princess.  Is it harmful?  Sometimes I wonder if the Disney princess thing is altogether harmless like we all pretend it is but, as far as princesses go, Sofia isn't half bad; she is a very nice girl.  Is the whole premise of the whole story sort of idiotic?  Yes, indeed.

The basic story here is that Sofia is just a girl living in a village as a peasant.  Her mom works at a shoe store or something and the King comes in and falls in love with her and she ends up Queen. They move to the castle and Sofia ends up a princess.  She inherits an entitled b%$#@ of a sister named Amber but she turns out to be not so bad really.  Sofia works through the trials and tribulations of learning to become a princess with grace and humility.

So, basically, it is all a load of crap but I still let my daughter watch it.  She still thinks that she too may end up a princess someday.  I am thinking that she will someday understand that this won't really happen but hopefully she hasn't been damaged in the process. As far as princesses go, Sofia is not a bad role model but I still don't love the premise of the story at all.",1440892800,,1303,4.168

5461996,3,B00ANVX6DY,"It was a cute movie about becoming a princess and learning how to be part of a new family. It is a short movie, only about 45 minutes though, which seemed a bit short considering the note on the front stating that it is a ""full length film"". My daughter loved that Cinderella appeared in the middle of the movie too and the songs are quite catchy. The movie also had a couple of good lessons for kids, like being nice to siblings and not taking the short and easy way out of things. This would be a great movie for families with kids that are merging. Just one minor change and I would have rated it much higher. I wish that I had read the description more closely and noticed that the story line had a sorcerer as a major character in the movie. I still haven't decided how I feel about my 2.5 year old daughter watching this movie because of that. Why couldn't they have just called him a magician or wizard or something a little less... I don't know. I just feel that sorcerer has some negative connotations that other titles may not have had. All in all, a cute short movie.",1395273600,2,1078,4.237864077669903

Now when i ordered the product, the description was for a DVD only.  But if you are going to describe it as such, then the sticker should have been removed prior to deliver or i am going to think that something is not amiss.

5462024,5,B00ANVX6DY,"My granddaughter is four and loves all things having to do with a Princess. She has been to DisneyWorld and has met Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. She sometimes is bothered by 'mean characters', but she understands what is reality.

In 'Sofia The Princess' Sofia has the voice of Ariel Winter. She is a commoner, living in the Village with her mother. Her mother is beautiful and makes boots. Sofia's mother, Miranda, whose voice is Sara Raminez, marries King Roland II, whose voice is Travis Willingham. Sofia and her mother leave their small Village and move to the Royal Castle where Roland and his children, James, whose voice is Zach Callison and Amber whose voice is Darcy Rose Byrnes. Sofia becomes immersed in the royal life, the Princess lessons, curtsey lessons and all the table lessons at Royal Prep Academy under the guidance of the Three Fairies. These three fairies have shown up in other Disney films and my granddaughter recognized them. Amber, the new stepsister is jealous that everyone who meets Sofia loves her.

When Roland announces that he's hosting a dance in Sofia's honor, Sofia worries that she can't dance. Tricks are played upon her, and her feelings are hurt. The magic sorcerer is indeed a meanie and we worry for Sofia. This film offers a lot of action and fun, but also many lessons are learned. For young children this is a wonderful way for them to learn.

The colors are vibrant, the songs are rich and delightful, the characters are full and believable. The storyline is perfect for children from 3-90. I enjoyed this film as much as my granddaughter.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-07-13",1381104000,,1628,4.866425992779783

5462091,5,B00ANVX6DY,"Sofia The First: Once Upon A Princess is a Disney DVD of the pilot for the Disney Channel/Disney Junior original series that introduces the newest member of the Disney Princess group, Princess Sofia. With an all-star voice cast including Ariel Winter, veteran voice actress Tress MacNielle(Tiny Toons), Sara Ramirez(Grey's Anatomy), Jess Harnell(Drawn Together), Wayne Brady(Let's Make A Deal), and TV personality Tim Gunn(Project Runway), Sofia The First tells the tale of a young girl named Sofia, who became a princess after her widowed mother marries the King, a widower himself, and Sofia and her mother, Miranda, are crowned Queen and Princess. However, life as a royal will not be easy for Sofia, as she is given the cold sholuder for her step-siblings and she is being coerced by a evil and goofy sorcerer named Cedric. So Sofia is going to the Royal Prepatory Academy run by the main headmistresses, The Good Fairies(Yes, the same fairies from the 1959 Disney classic Sleeping Beauty)and teaches Sofia all about being a good princess and being good to all. The special features includes a make-your-own tiara kit and sing-along segment, as well as Disney sneak peeks of upcoming favourites like Monsters University, Planes, The Return to Never Land DVD re-release and a trailer of the Tinker Bell movie, to be released in 2014.

after watching this DVD with my girls I can atest that as old as 7.5 will totally enjoy it. It has some values in it and it teaches you kindness and all that so it is good and different of typical
scare the shorts of little kids with some super scary vilans type of deal. So this is good. It has other princess characters in it.. Cindy being one of htem, there good faires from Aurora story etc..
Story is good, action flows nicely, graphics are awsome. Easy to watch and very enjoyable. The better if you get it with the costume and amulet and tiara but not the one that is included with this dvd as those are jsut booklet style fold and make it yourself things with stickers and not real deal.
