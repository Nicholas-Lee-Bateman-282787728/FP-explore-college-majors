It's face gets all distorted and scary. My five-year-old came upstairs crying and wouldn't go back downstairs. Even after I turned it off, she was devastated and had nightmares over it. I can't believe a Hello Kitty movie could be so scary.",1284249600,,406,4.426666666666667
8510257,4,B0007WFU7O,"This is only 6 episodes, unlike volume 1 with 8, but all are good stories and definetly still very worth getting.  More than any baby einstein this is my 10-month olds favorite DVD, especially ""Hello Kitty in Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Hello Kitty in Swan Princes"" but they are all really good and my husband and I both love ""Bad Badtz-Maru in the Ants and the Grasshopper"" and  ""Monkichi the Monkey in The Gold Axe and the Silver Axe"".  Last 2 episodes are ""Hello Kitty in The Nutcracker"" and ""Koro Koro Kuririn in The Country Mouse and the Town Mouse""  both of which are really good too.

Hope this helps anyone wanting to know what the stories are before hand.",1247097600,3,658,4.495798319327731
