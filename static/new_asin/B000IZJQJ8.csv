8147977,4,B000IZJQJ8,"This isn't your typical PBS isn't-the-human-race-horrible-now-send-money  salute to animals.  Attenborough takes us on a journey of discovery through the various terrains and ecosystems of Aussieland to the home of the bower bird.  It's a fun, revealing, beautifully photographed but too-short visit to birds that have a unique method of courtship.

The bower bird is so named because the males build bachelor pads (or honeymoon suites as the case may be) called bowers.  These structures can be amazingly complex, and are decorated with various berries, pebbles, flowers and other enticements.  The whole point of them is to attract a female's eye, and if she likes what she sees, she'll fly down to inspect the bower, which is when mating occurs.  The female rears the young alone; the male is completely unencumbered with responsibility for caring for his offspring, which gives him plenty of time to refurbish and tend to his bower, hoping to attract yet another female, and another after that.  It's irresistible to compare bower birds to certain men, isn't it?  Fun to watch, and a great show for the whole family.",1180310400,,1120,5.1098901098901095
