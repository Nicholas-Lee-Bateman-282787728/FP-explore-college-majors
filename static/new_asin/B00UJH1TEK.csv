7046539,4,B00UJH1TEK,"Drownsman, is not as creepy as it could have been but still is a well put together film. The acting is great and the effects are all done well. Like I  said could have used more the water element to make it more creepier like Darkness Falls used the dark.  The Drownsman himself I think is where the film losses it's steam. He appears to be just a wet dirty guy, and they showed is face to much which wasn't scary at all. If they had hid it under the hair it would have worked out better.  The scares in the film to is another point at which Drownsman fails to deliver.  The kills are way to simple and there seems to be no real build up. After they enter his lair it's basically wash rinse repeat.  Like a said the film is superbly acted with a mainly dominate female cast which I love.  Even if some of the characters aren't completely fleshed out in this they work well together. The water effects are top notch as well as the color grading that gave certain parts of the film that grimy look. Still a well done movie, just not interesting enough to be a great horror movie .  The title could have been better as well.",1431216000,2,1121,4.162037037037037
7046540,4,B00UJH1TEK,"The film opens with Isabel Heller (Katie Nicole Evans) killing the Drownsman (Ry Barrett) aka Sebastian Donner. Okay film over. Not quite. Later, Madison (Michelle Mylett) has a near drowning incident in a lake where she sees the Drownsman, and develops an unnatural fear of all things liquid, yet manages to stay clean. Her friends decide to help, but end up unlocking our villain who moves between dimensions and emerges from water, reminding me of a cross between a no personality Freddie and Ghost Shark.

Madison must solve the horror mystery as her friends disappear.

The film is a decent horror film with a bad guy that could have been better. Michell Mylett gave a good performance down to the nervous cracking in her voice. She should be doing more than B horror and is clearly better than her support cast. Worth a view for horror fans. Should be watched by candlelight in a bathtub.

7046541,4,B00UJH1TEK,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I love horror films that introduce unique villains, especially those who are original enough to become genre icons in their own right (for example, Jason, Michael Myers, Freddy, Jigsaw, etc.)  The films that birth these characters are usually labors of love and not just someones attempt to make a quick buck.  THE DROWNSMAN is one such title, an impressive attempt at adding to the prestigious list of iconic horror figures.  And although it has a few flaws, the film is a lot of fun and I recommend giving it a look.

I love the concept of the killer and his unique way of dispatching victims; drowning has to be one of the worst ways to die, and using it as the primary way of a killer dispatching his victims is very clever.  This is especially true when combined with the supernatural elements the killer invokes.

THE DROWNSMAN is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  The film was shot using a RED camera, so the picture quality is excellent.  Likewise, the ambient sounds are crystal clear in surround-sound, and lend a huge hand in building suspense for the film.

The acting in THE DROWNSMAN is pretty good, although a couple of the actresses are a bit lackluster in their deliveries.  Michelle Mylett, who plays the lead, Madison, does a great job and exhibits a wide range of emotional diversity in the film.  Ry Barrett, who portrays The Drownsman himself, is a solid and foreboding figure.  His silent but menacing performance injects a nice shot of terror into the film.

But there are a couple of negatives about the THE DROWNSMAN as well.  For one, we are never told how he pulls his disappearing act in the opening scenes, nor are we ever told why or how he has supernatural powers.  Theres not even any speculation as to how this happened.  Another example is how Sebastian is supposedly defeated: with fire.  Really?  I thought water doused fire, therefore how could a supernatural entity like The Drownsman be terrified of it?  And if it pertains to his backstory, shouldnt we be told about that?

Still, with these minor issues aside, THE DROWNSMAN is a heck of a film, and it highlights the talent of director Chad Archibald.  Given the way the movie ends, I sure hope there is a sequel in the works, and I hope it answers the questions above.  If that is the case, THE DROWNSMAN will move up several notches in my book.  I recommend giving this one a look, if anything to check out a new and original horror figure.  The film is available next week in a variety of formats, so make a note.",1430956800,,2590,4.566160520607375
7046542,5,B00UJH1TEK,"'The Drownsman,' directed by Chad Archibald ('Neverlost'), written by Cody Calahan ('Antisocial') and Chad Archibald, produced by Christopher Giroux ('Dead All Night'), is a film that as it opens (which it does right from the off, no messing around around here with any lame build ups!), you kinda feel like you might be in for a rough night with. Which you are, but not in that way, because 'The Drownsman' (which is still a bad title, sorry) gets better, and better as it builds the story.

Indeed, the whole 80's feel to the entire thing - from the way it is filmed re: angles and the ""matte"" feel to it (although they used RED cameras, which are top notch and rather expensive), through to the cheesy dialogue, on through to the lame Drownsman manky costume - might be off putting for those more modern day horror buffs, but trust me when I tell you to stick with this film - through to the VERY end! The story is easy, the outcome obvious, but the final, final true outcome completely unexpected!

After almost drowning in a lake accident, Madison (Mylett) dives deep into her crippling post trauma fear of water. To the point that a year later she misses her friends wedding, and her role as Maid of Honor. So, the bride and her friends get Madison to her house (but where's the husband?) and they hold a faux spiritual intervention to try and rid Madison of her supposed visions of this ""dark figure"" she draws pictures of.

But that goes horribly wrong, and soon - one by one- the girls are all brought kicking and screaming into the world of the Drownsman. As Madison tries to help her friends, watching them disappear one by one, her inner strength grows, her internet homework pays off, and soon she is herself knee deep in the horrifying place that was the last place on earth that she wanted to be!

Chock full of some great cinematic moments, that use the RED camera perfectly - such as a delightful ""long wet hair toss"" at the start - the death scenes are different, inventive, and well executed (no pun intended) also! Sure it was filmed in Ontario, Canada, which means most all the young cast sport an underlying Canadian accent, and sure the film goes quiet in the middle (as they try to figure things out), but scenes like the disappearing wet cell phone, the ""angry"" washing machine, and the hair salon are just so much fun, you rewind mid-film just to have the pleasure of rewatching them!

The end result is a solid tribute - even if it wasn't meant as one - to the 80's style of horror film making, whilst at the same time being a unique take on that genre also for the modern day. Even the death of Madison's female co-star will bring a sadness to your face, believe me! And how often do you actually care abut any teenager getting killed in these types of movies. Here though, it is just a very sad moment that hangs, cleverly suspended in time for those few cinematic moments. And, as mentioned above twice now, the actual real ending is a trip, to say the least!

7046543,3,B00UJH1TEK,"Lively but not exactly good horror flick concerns a young woman named Madison who nearly drowns at an engagement party moments after being asked to be her best friend's maid of honor.  She's on a pier and seconds after her friend leaves her alone Madison somehow ends up unconscious and in the water.  While drowning she is transported somewhere else by a serial killer called the Drownsman who was killed by one of his victims in the opening scene and has basically become the Freddy Kreuger of water.  When Madison is resuscitated she escapes from the Drownsman's lair but her friends don't understand what happened to her.

A year later we find out that Madison has such a strong fear of water that she ingests fluids intravenously (if she's afraid of a glass of water why is a clear bag of water also not terrifying?) and missed her best friend's wedding because it was raining outside.  The next day her friends stage an intervention where they invite a spiritualist to pretend to dispel whatever is haunting Madison and convince her it's gone and everything will be better.  Unfortunately the spiritualist isn't a fake--she actually sees the malevolent spirit that is after Madison (although no one believes her) and the supposed to be phony seance they conducted opened a door for the Drownsman so that he can go after Madison's unbelieving friends as well.

The screenplay feels like a sketchy first draft in need of a rewrite if only to fix some obvious logical flaws.  During the engagement party when Madison asks her best friend whether she said yes or not Hannah shows off her new engagement ring--like her friends wouldn't have noticed it within 30 seconds of meeting up with her.  Hannah stages an intervention the day after Madison misses her wedding--so why isn't Hannah on her honeymoon?  Who did she marry?  Unless it's one of the female friends we never see the groom and he/she is never referred to even though the rest of the movie takes place on the two days immediately following Hannah's wedding.  If Madison hasn't had a bath or shower in a year wouldn't she be kind of gross and smelly like a homeless person rather than gorgeous and perfectly made up?

The screenplay does almost nothing to set up Madison's past--basically it's just one line uttered by a therapist--and also does a very poor job of establishing any sense of time so the movie's big twist seems to come literally out of thin air.  The character of the Drownsman is not given much in the way of a personality or coherent mythology.  He does look creepy but doesn't have a single line of dialogue.  Has he been killing other young women in the time between his death in the opening scene and Madison coming across him during her accident?  Why would the Drownsman be afraid of fire?  When water and fire mix water wins so this vulnerability doesn't make a lot of sense.  There's also no attempt to explain why the Drownsman can do what he does and didn't simply die in the opening scene like a normal human being.

I looked up screenwriter Cody Calahan in the IMDB and was surprised to see that he wrote and directed Antisocial, a 2013 horror film about a virus spreading from social media to actual people that also had some weird logic issues (at one point a character who is going to become infected but isn't showing symptoms yet is tied to a chair on the first floor of the house then she and the chair are carried with great difficulty up the stairs to the next floor--why not just tie her up on the 2nd floor in the first place?) but was still pretty enjoyable.  Maybe The Drownsman would have worked better if Cody Calahan had directed as well.

The screenplay does come up with some imaginative ways to put Madison's friends in danger but director Chad Archibald never really figures out how to film the underwater scenes so they are actually creepy--he probably should have watched Night of the Hunter and The Cell before making this.  On the plus side Archibald has a pretty good eye and The Drownsman is fairly handsome to look at for a low-budget horror film and also fast-paced, something that is definitely good if you are filming a dopy script.

The Drownsman has a couple of good laughs involving the fear that a glass of water on a coffee table table or a nurse with a bottle of water in an elevator inspires among the characters--unfortunately The Drownsman mostly plays it straight and is never actually scary or suspenseful.  Still, The Drownsman qualifies as a nice try that's never boring--if you're a horror fan you can definitely do a lot worse.",1430524800,4,4563,4.659600997506234

7046549,2,B00UJH1TEK,"An interesting concept, but the writers didn't put nearly enough thought into it.  The Drownsman is to water, what Freddy Kruger is to sleep.  The same way it's impossible to avoid sleep, it's impossible to avoid water.  A water ring left on a table can lead to the Drownsman pulling you into his world.  The reason why I say the writers didn't put enough thought into it is because the only thing that the Drownsman is afraid of is fire.  Fire?  Really?  Doesn't water extinguish fire fairly quickly?  Other than water and fire being opposites there is really no explanation as to why fire makes the Drownsman, wet himself (pun intended).  Also, the twist that happens about two-thirds of the way through the movie seems like it was thought of after the fact.  SPOILER ALERT:  It is presented that the Drownsman is killing people because he wants his daughter.  What happens when he finally gets his daughter?  Nothing.  He just keeps on killing.  If there was ever a movie that needs to be remade with better writing this would be it.",1440892800,,1036,4.6464088397790055
7046550,3,B00UJH1TEK,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Its difficult to come up with an original horror film icon, a monster or murderous character that can carry a movie from start to finish and filter into the imagination of viewers even after the lights have gone up and the film finished on the screen. The names of Jason, Michael and Freddy bring about those fears with ease to movie fans even though its been several years since any have had a major release to theaters. Some of these characters never made it to the big screen but have developed a following on DVD. Names like Victor Crowley from the HATCHET films or Chromeskull from LAID TO REST are well known to horror fans. My hope is that The Drownsman will be added to the lists of those fans.

After nearly drowning in a lake, Madison develops a near catatonic fear of water. She soon becomes a shut in, unable to deal with her fear and finding herself on the downside of friendship with girls shes known for years. In a last ditch effort to break the traumatic fear that keeps her captive an intervention is brought on by those friends where they include having a sance to help alieve those fears.

Bad move on their part. It seems that once they do that the long dormant killer known as the Drownsman rises once again. And he intends to add more victims to his list. The killer received the moniker because of his penchant for taking his victims to a hidden location where he would proceed to drown them, not quite all at once but enough to keep them going before finishing them off.

As the night and next few days progress, the girls begin to become his newest victims. It doesnt take a lot for him to appear, just enough water to make his way into their world. Sure, you could see him doing this in something the size of a bathtub but instead he makes his way from his world to ours through things as small as a sink. He reaches through, grabs a girl and pulls her from this world into his, the dimly lighted sub-basement where he kept his victims long ago.

As the number of missing girls rises Madisons decision to face her fears and save her friends takes hold. But will this be enough for her to face down the Drownsman or will he merely add her to his list of victims? And once she enters his world how will she get rid of these ghostly killer? What will it take to rid the world of this evil?

The movie offers some truly creepy moments. While the whole sance seems incredibly stupid for anyone to do to someone who has a fear of water and what could be in it, its the normal thing that happens in horror films. Its along the lines of oh gee, were in the woods and were teenagers, lets have sex type situation. That aside the character of the Drownsman has few lines but does offer an image that is nightmare inducing for some.

While definitely a low budget affair the whole package has a well-polished look and the performances are above par for direct to DVD status. Each actor involved makes his or her character seem real and thats not an easy thing to do in a horror film. The fact that the atmosphere seeps into each setting makes it that much more believable and aids in making their portrayals just as real.

There are plenty of horror films on the shelves these days and far too many of them are direct to DVD. Most aren't worthy of your time but THE DROWNSMAN doesnt fall into that category. Instead give this one a watch with the lights out and then I dare you to take a bath.",1440547200,2,3465,4.32

8707089,2,B00UJH1TEK,"The back-of-case summary doesn't give you the best picture of this movie, so allow me to paraphrase. The movie opens with a suitably creepy serial killer scene, at the end of which the murderer disappears. Years later, Madison becomes terrified of all water after a near-drowning experience where she sees the murderer in a vision. Rather than being supportive of her as she tries to overcome her life-crippling fear, Madison's ""friends"" berate her and threaten to leave her if she doesn't ""get over it,"" especially her selfish, raging bridezilla of a bestie. They end up channeling our killer (the titular ""Drownsman"") in a botched intervention, and he's now out to get all of them.

""The Drownsman"" bills itself as a spiritual successor to supernatural slashers like Freddy Kreuger, and there is some truth to that. They manage to do some creative and unique things with the way this killer can manifest himself anywhere there's water. The way Madison and the others have to avoid water is also ""Nightmare""-esque and neat. I'll also give this movie props for looking good -- it's visually very well-produced, unlike the cheap, grainy video you get from a lot of low-budget slashers.

With that said, it fails as a horror movie for the reasons I hinted at in my first paragraph: ultimately, most viewers won't care if these girls live or die because they're so fundamentally unlikeable. Madison's friends all come across as incredibly mean and self-centered, and Madison herself is dumb for staying attached to them after that treatment. The Drownsman himself also lacks personality. He has a good gimmick, but in the crowded field of slashers that have arisen since the 1980s, the hulking silent type no longer stands out in the crowd.

I can give this a mild recommendation for only two groups: those who like slasher movies without liking blood and gore (this actually works pretty well in that regard), or new horror fans who might not be jaded from having seen a million similar pictures. For most other viewers, especially longtime horror fans, this is skippable.",1450483200,,2070,4.976878612716763

Where he gets his powers/strength from is also never fully explained & theres a sort of twist thrown in as well. The acting wasn't anything too great but serviceable for what it is, its not outright horrible either. Not much in the way of effects either but the few times you actually get a good look at the killer he doesn't look bad at all.
