323046,3,6301216113,"Get this: Steve McQueen and Natalie Wood as, what else? Ethnic Italians living in New York City.  Seriously. After you choke that down, you're looking at a movie with three distinct themes: 1) An honest and uncomfortable look back into the world of illegal abortions; 2) Third or fourth-generation Italian-Americans caught between their suffocating traditional families and their desire to be a part of mainstream New York City and; 3) a simple love story.  The trouble with this movie is that the three themes never seem to integrate with each other. It starts off great with the set-up to the story.  But then, the characters meander about in a plot that serves the story about the social issues over that of the characters themselves. This was especially tedious in a scene during the ""Italian kids yearning to breathe free"" part of the story where McQueen hits his parents up for dough in a park on the East Side. It goes on forever and we end up nowhere on the story side with McQueen and Wood, but we learn incrementally more about how it must feel like to be a young Italian-American belonging in two worlds, but completely comfortable in neither.  The payoff is in the third movie inside the movie where Wood teaches McQueen and her brothers a lesson in appreciation and respect for women not borne from duty, but from love.  That's where the movie shines. There are some great scenes between the two and, by the end, we're convinced that Wood and McQueen belong together.  The movie ends up delivering the goods, but it's not from the cumulative effect of indulging all of the side issues that it takes on. It's from the five-minute set-up at the beginning and the ten or twelve-minute long movie inside the movie that's just a straight love story.  Adorable performance from Tom Bosley as the hapless but true bachelor.",971136000,12,1829,4.750788643533123
323047,4,6301216113,"i saw this movie when i was a senior in high school.  i went to the drive  in with an italian young man, who laughed at all the language ( in italian,  of course) that both families used and i had no clue what was being said.  but in spite of that, i thought it was a very good story:  it was sad,  funny, and heartfelt, all in one and one half hour.  i loved the part when  steve comes to natalie's for dinner and tries to get her to go to bed with  him, and she says that she knows him better now so she can't do that, and  he is totally clueless about her feelings.  also, the ending just makes me  cry when i think about it, it is soooooooooo romantic.  a very good movie,  even today, which was just on last week on our local cable channel. i had  not seen it since the 60's, but it is still one of my favorites.  there  will be only one natalie wood and steve mcqueen.",965001600,18,874,3.875
323048,5,6301216113,"I LOVE this film!  When you watch it you must remember that it was made in the 1960s and it was quite a groundbreaking film.  Natalie Wood is BRILLIANT (her finest performance) as Angie, a girl who becomes pregnant  and suddenly forced to take control of her own life.  Steve McQueen is  fabulous as the man who impregnated her. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",953856000,20,348,4.639344262295082
323049,4,6301216113,"Should you ever need to describe the essential of good chemistry between two actors, point them to Woods and McQueen in this film. If you seek a film that captures the glorious grit of New York City locales rather than  the glitz - this film. It you like romance reflective of life's harsh  realities . . . .  How marvelous to view these two actors rise like stars  to the level of this film, surpass it, but then reach back to pull the film  up to their level. Rise, indeed. Like the stars they were. And still they  shine.",947030400,12,524,4.242424242424242

323051,4,6301216113,"This movie is among the very few that have moved me to tears. One can appreciate the immigrant family aspect of the film and Wood's character's yearning for liberation. The storyline is particularly endearing, and I  believe the movie did a good job in developing it. Natalie is, of course,  so cute, and Stephen McQueen is the reprobate you just hope will reform.",915580800,4,364,4.761904761904762

323165,5,6301216113,"One of my all tme favorites. It depicted McQeen's vulnerable side and Woods' stronger side. I originally bought this movie in vhs format. I played it til I wore it out. I then bought the dvd. Though the cover art is cheesy, and the scene was not depected in the movie, just get past it and enjoy the movie. The cover art didn't even look like McQeen & Wood. It was the only dumb thing about the dvd. Again the movie was great and was made at a time when babies lives mattered.",1519516800,,476,4.129032258064516

The <sign> at the end had me scratching my head, and it's the only few seconds McQueen is shown playing an instrument, as he is supposed to be a musician.

Amazon disappoints here in that only Standard Def is offered. This film is out on Blu-Ray, wide screen and far better picture.",1515801600,,422,4.410256410256411

Their chemistry is amazing! The setting - New York City in the early 60s - is fascinating in itself. If you love these two actors, you will likely enjoy this movie. Myself, I loved it.",1515628800,,359,4.217391304347826

323207,5,6301216113,"I first saw this movie when I was in my early teens, it made an impression then, and it makes an impression now!  Featuring two of the most acclaimed actors and personalities of the time, I believe that this movie starring  Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen is one of their best. The plot is unique, with memorable characters, humor, and drama.  I loved the story so much I have never forgotten it.  It is in black and white, which I thinks adds to the movie, it is timely for the era, and it is fun to see how customs and attitudes have changed.  The viewer should appreciate the historical value of the era portrayed.  Take note of the wardrobe, family ties, even how perhaps the department store Macy's conducted business!  A must for a film lover.",1515024000,,748,4.455882352941177

323229,5,6301216113,"Thank You Amazon for a great quality CD!!  I waited a very long time for this movie to be released on DVD, and the wait was well worth it.
 For an old film, (1963), the picture was so clear, and the sound was perfect. Not flawed at all. As for the movie, all I can say is that this classic should be seen by all generations. This was a time where sensitivity, discretion, and fear played a part of peoples lives.
Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen did an excellent job portraying a couple thrown into a complicated situation.
Thanks again Amazon....You made me very happy!!",1513900800,,569,4.40952380952381

McQueen and Wood have great chemistry and that unfolds right before your eyes as you watch them.",1511827200,,346,4.421875
323235,5,6301216113,One of my favorite Steve McQueen films Glad I found it on DVD,1511827200,,61,3.769230769230769
323236,4,6301216113,"A very sweet black and white film from the early 1960s shows Italian family life in New York through the story of an improbable love affair between a freelance musician (the cool, minimalist, brilliant Steve McQueen) and a Macy's shopgirl (the astoundingly beautiful -- and never more than in this film -- Natalie Wood). Herschel Bernardi (playing Italian!) is great as Natalie Wood's possessive brother, and it's great to see scenes of New York in this era.

McQueen plays a kind of clueless romantic -- a different role, and different type of movie than the ones he'd become more known for -- but he's engaging. Although Wood's character is suspicious after a life of urban men trying to play fast and loose with her, McQueen's character would never think of being anything but respectful and caring. The difference in their family lives (both a bit dysfunctional, but hers in particular) explains it all. Watch it when you're in the mood for a good, old-fashioned romance with some comedy, some drama, and some bumps in the road, including a powerful scene set in a (at that time illegal) back room abortion.",1510444800,4,1111,4.847368421052631
323237,5,6301216113,"What's not to love when you have the chemistry of the likes of Natalie Wood & Steve McQueen, true icons and never to be again.  This movie demonstrates why these two stars were the very best of the name given them of 'movie star'.  Their lights still shine in their movies & I am very glad to have them preserved forever in their movie roles on film.  Kudos to them for being  who they are today! I love this movie & I love its theme song, one of the most romantic songs of all time!  Kudos to Pakula-Mulligan for their top notch direction & collaboration on this plot subject.  Their attention to detail & sensitivity to plot material shines through on the the big screen.",1510185600,2,673,4.344

323268,5,6301216113,"This is a romantic drama with comedic elements.  Steve McQueen and Natalie Wood are at the heighth of their careers.  It will make you laugh and cry.  Very true to life.  It feels very contemporary to me and the stars look contemporary.  Just a wonderful, wonderful movie.  If I could I give it 100 stars.  It is also Tom Bosley's (Richie Cunningham's dad from Happy Day) first movie.",1508889600,,384,4.5588235294117645

There are minor imperfections that pop up here and there, the cue marks are still present and there is an annoying hair or mark of some kind in the lower part of the frame that lasts for a few minutes!

323305,4,6301216113,"What could be as good as Natalie Wood, other than Natalie with Steve McQueen? This is a sweet, Charming love in reverse film that fans of both stars will love, if they don't already. Natalie Wood received her third Oscar nomination for her role as Angie. So good to see both on film again.",1506902400,,289,4.37037037037037
323306,5,6301216113,"Okay, let's be clear: I love the FILM.  The FILM is great, and the star wattage of Wood and McQueen results in two performances that are at the top end of their body of work.  The direction is simple and beautiful, the writing is wonderful and heartfelt, and the score by Elmer Bernstein is tops, as is the supporting cast.

The good news: Finally we have this in its proper screen ratio.  Kudos all around.
The bad news: Well, not ""bad"" but while the packaging tells us it's newly remastered in HD that is meaningless as everything on Blu-ray is mastered in HD.  Meaningless - it's all about the elements.  While the film looks better than it has on other home video releases, it could and should look much better than it does here.  Close-ups have nice detail and clarity, but medium and long shots are just too soft and lack detail.  There is also so little grain that it makes me think something was done in that regard.  What is very clear is the transfer is not from the camera negative and there has been no new internegative made from the camera negative - easy to tell since the old internegative used has burned in changeover cue marks - some removed and some shockingly still there.  If you love the film, like me you'll need to make the purchase.  But since this is going to be it for this film, it's a damn shame it doesn't sparkle as it should.",1506038400,9,1358,4.370517928286852

Love With the Proper Stranger is a sweet, poignant movie about a couple who have a rather rocky start to their romance. Considering that the story is set in the early sixties, the situations that are explored are difficult for that era, but as always, love wins.

323559,4,6301216113,"""Love with the Proper Stranger"" is a black-and-white film released by Paramount to theaters in a 1.85:1 format. The Spanish region 2 DVD with ASIN B00GP9A3SO is a fuzzy dub of a pan-and-scan 1.33 format VHS tape, one that looks like it was borrowed many times from a public library before the dub was made. Even the main titles are so fuzzy that the letters bleed into each other. Amazon's information page does not disclose the format of this edition, which would be a useful clue.

If you visit the IMDB page for ""Love with the Proper Stranger,"" you will see a different DVD cover (an edition no longer easy to find). I should have done this due diligence before purchasing a premium-priced edition. But I didn't, so I hope someone else can benefit from my mistake. By the way, I've noticed over time that the covers IMDB shows are frequently the best available modern releases of older films. That can be helpful if you are interested in a public-domain film like ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.""

The rating on this review is for the fine movie: 4 1/2 stars. As Amazon bundles reviews for all releases together, you may be looking at a different edition. The headline caveat emptor applies specifically to the Spanish DVD with ASIN B00GP9A3SO -- and likely to any other release with the same cover. It is a purchase I can't recommend.",1459382400,7,1341,4.630252100840337
323590,5,6301216113,"A classic drama with comic aspects. Both Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen delivered great natural performances. The tone was very serious at the start, but lightened as the movie progressed. It's unfortunate it is not available on a USA Region DVD or Blu Ray  format. Fortunately the Spanish DVD  menu allowed for audio and subtitles in English. The video quality showed its age. It is a movie worth seeing with a great supporting cast as well as two headline actors demonstrating their theatrical talent.",1459209600,,503,4.976190476190476

323757,5,6301216113,"This is a great little film -- black and white, btw -- even though they show a color photo of Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen on the ""cover.""

Natalie has a one-night stand with McQueen.  She ends up in the ""family"" way.  She is a sales clerk at Macy's in New York and lives at home with her extended family -- and a couple of tough brothers who, of course, come into the equation later in the film.

Most of the film centers around Natalie finding McQueen and convincing him to ""help"" her.  She finds him in a hiring hall for musicians.  He doesn't recognize her.

SPOILER ALERT -- READ NO MORE UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS --  JUST WATCH THE FILM

He takes her to a rundown building for an illegal back-alley ""procedure"" -- but protects her at the last minute from going through with it.

She later decides that she doesn't want his help or to participate in a ""shotgun"" wedding -- as arranged by her brothers when they find out about her condition. She moves out on her own.  McQueen sees her in a different light.  They begin anew in a more ""proper"" way.  Maybe there can be Love between strangers -- if each is the Proper one.",1415232000,,1138,4.286384976525822

I kept waiting for it to get good, for an explanation of how, when, where they originally met, PLUS we're supposed to believe that ANY man could have forgotten having met and bedded a beauty like Natalie Wood, of all people. NOT. Plodding, boring, unreal on so many levels. Here's what I think: the producers felt a winning team of Mr. Macho McQueen and adorable Natalie would be a money-maker regardless of holes in the storyline and agonizingly slow pace. I don't know how it did at the box office, but this is one movie I'm sorry I wasted time and money on. Yawner.",1414540800,6,632,4.410256410256411

The acting was exceptional especially the scene for the abortion.  Now we're not talking about abortion issues here, but what I remember then and now is that it struck you hard that scene, it made you take stock of the decisions you made that had brought you to that point.  I loved the family dynamics of both character's, and I loved the love story in the background.  I will always love the knight in shinning amour even if it's a bit tarnished.

They are the perfect pair to share the screen - odd, polar opposites but simultaneously a likely match, and they're not, and they are, most of the time. The chemistry that attracts people can be puzzling, beautiful, frustrating,hilarious, and no other actor and actress represent it better than Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen in Love With The Proper Stranger.

The film is intelligently written, with depth, humor, pathos, and sparklingly real characters.  Natalie Wood is at her most beautiful and gives a conflicted and compelling performance (though maybe she overacts just a touch during the ""the doctor"" scene.)  This is one of those rare movies that you can watch over and over, and new things will grab your attention each time.",1396051200,,636,5.393939393939394

His facial expressions made the movie and the little things he said, calling her ""Louie"" and ""Zelda"" and his ""Now wait a minute,"" must truly be Steve McQueen because he says it in The Great Escape too!  They really worked well off of each other and her brothers were so over protective!  It does not matter how much you try and watch someone...where there is a will there is a way.

I have watched this so many times and each time I see another subtle touches.  The things that were said and done...you have to watch more than once to see them all.  This is one of those movies from the late 1950s and early to mid-1960s that I loved and they stopped making them for a while.  Doris Day, Rock Hudson, Cary Grant,  James Garner, Tony Randal, Paula Prentiss, Gina Lollobrigida, Tony Curtis, Jane Fonda and Robert Redford all made them and made them well!

Artfully Directed in black & white by Robert Mulligan, Produced by Alan J. Pakula from a screenplay by Arnold Schulman, this love story-comedy has yet to be available on DVD. The chemistry between McQueen, as the street wise trumpet player ""Rocky Papasano"" and ""Angie Rossini"" (Wood) as the girl he impregnates in a one night hook-up is palpable. The acting is uniformly superb and the ensemble cast of NY actors like Harvey Lembeck (Stalag 17) and Herschel Bernardi (Fiddler on the Roof)  as ""Angie''s"" well intentioned but, bumbling bachelor brothers  makes the cast human. Singer, comediane, Edie Adams turns in a delightful cameo as ""Rocky's"" world weary stripper girlfriend. The film also was the screen debut of Tom Bosley who later became a household name in televisions ""Happy Days"".

"".....Stranger"" is a story about life, love, comedy blended seamlessly with moments of somber reality, anxiety, fear and above all, hope. If you are a romantic you will take this film to your heart as I did. On a personal note, I was fortunate to witness in 1963 the filming of several exterior scenes in a eastside NYC public park (1st. Ave) opposite the U.N. complex. I will never forget seeing Natalie Wood quietly standing only a few feet away waiting patiently to be called to film her scene with McQueen. She was even more beautiful in person than on screen. It's a memory I cherish and what makes this film even more special for me.

her big brother hovering like a drone.
Natale Woods '""Angie""  was ahead of her time with
determined independence....but then there's a vulnerability
with the decision....is this decision really what she
wants?
The camera LOVES Steve McQueen. Subtle expressions while
He thinks things out. The ""he really is a good guy"" comes
out, but even then he challenges those feelings, growing
feelings for""Angie"". Again he shows those ""thinking things
out""expressions. And the best thing is he's so
good looking...okay, gorgeously drop dead handsome. Timing,
he has it. Gestures, he has them down. Spot on.

323979,4,6301216113,"""Love with the Proper Stranger"" is a startlingly modern depiction of courtship done in reverse.  When musician Rocky finds out that a one-night stand with virginal Angie resulted in pregnancy, the two of them are forced to work together to come up with a solution. Despite their mutual reluctance to become tied down, they begin to fall for each other.

The first half of this film has an almost documentary feel to it, thanks to the authentic setting and the story's frankness.  Unusual for its era, ""Love"" allows the actors to interact naturally, with plenty of pauses and hesitations, and often with no soundtrack imposing an emotion or mood.

The scenes of Angie and Rocky waiting to meet up with an abortionist and then going to her cold, unsanitary apartment are truly tense and chilling.  When Rocky visits his old neighborhood, even though it plays a bit too long, it has a genuine look and feel of a local golden boy /prodigal's return.

Steve McQueen's quiet charisma and likability are a terrific foil to Natalie Wood's warm but wary Angie. Tom Bosley's sweet, schleppy suitor offers some much-needed comic relief, as do the interactions with their families. Edie Adams is noteworthy as the tough, touching stripper Rocky lives with--until his infidelity catches up with him.

The only reason I gave this movie less than five stars is because the ending, while fine, seems rushed and abrupt. So much time is spent building up Rocky's and Angie's barriers toward each other, that they get knocked down too fast for the sake of winding up the story.  A few more quick scenes, establishing that Angie and Rocky have more in common than they originally think, would have made the finale even more satisfying.

Also, because Columbo so clearly cares for Angie, it shadows our hope that she will find happiness with Rocky.

Overall, though, this is a remarkable film, and well worth viewing.  THANK YOU to whoever finally made it available for streaming, as it has long been out of print in any other format.",1360368000,,2013,4.839650145772595

The plot: After a one-night stand, Angie (Natalie Wood) finds herself pregnant and informs Rocky (Steve McQuenn) that she wants an abortion. The twist: Abortion's are illegal and being performed in dirty back rooms by hacks. The film is a gritty drama but it's also a romantic comedy.

324024,5,6301216113,"Natalie Wood never looked more beautiful as she did in LOVE WITH A PROPER STRANGER. She is paired with handsome Steve McQueen in this delightful love story. McQueen and Wood were among the sexiest and most popular actors of the 1960's and they have a great chemistry on screen. LOVE WITH THE PROPER STRANGER appears never to have been released on DVD so I was fortunate to find a VHS copy on Amazon. I've been working on seeing all 30 or so of Steve McQueen's films and only LOVE WITH A PROPER STRANGER seemed to miss out on the DVD era. Too bad since it is such charming film.

Natalie Wood play Angie Rossini. She's a proper Italian American Catholic girl whose one mistake has now gotten her in trouble. She tracks down the man of her indiscretion,  Rocky Papasano, played by Steve McQueen, to seek his help in finding a doctor. The 1963 movie is interesting as it takes us back to a time when many subjects were taboo in American films. It's clear what Angie's situation is but the words pregnant or abortion are never used. She's a woman who needs to find ""a doctor.""

As in MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, Natalie Wood again plays a character with a connection to Macy's Department Store. This time she is a sales clerk in the Pet Department at Macy's. Macy's used to have a pet department with fish tanks and all? Watching older films can be such a fun journey into days long gone. Wood's Angie is an independent minded young woman with a loving but overly-protective family. Her older brother played by the great Herschel Bernardi is smoothing her with his loving protection no doubt the smothering love made led her to her ""mistake.""

They don't make romantic comedies like this anymore and it is a pure joy watching Wood and McQueen as their characters' relationship develops. It's a foregone conclusion as to how it will all end, but watching the process is fun. A young Tom Bosely co-stars as Anthony - the suitor Angie's family has chosen for her. He's a sweet and kindly man who is totally smitten with Angie. He's a good choice for security but he  doesn't set off ""bells and whistles"" in her head.

Harvey Lembeck also stars as one of Angie's brothers. LOVE WITH A PROPER STRANGER is so much fun to watch. The cast is great and there are a lot of actors who later went on to bigger roles in TV and film. Lovely Edie Adams also costars. The film is interesting in how it handles the theme of a ""girl in trouble in need of a doctor."" Both Angie and Rocky are surrounded by loving families. There are no bad guys, except for ""the doctor"". People are trapped in a smothering routine and want to break out as so many people do. It is a lovely film with a delightful cast.",1344729600,8,2674,4.435845213849287

What is ever-so-more likely is that the liberal movie big-wigs have decided not to widely distribute a film the caliber of this one which shows, clearly, the horrible reality of any abortion, whether it is back street, or main street. This movie impacted me, as a teenager, with its vivid protrayal of the psychological nightmare the mother must undergo when she even contemplates the violent death of her unborn child. We did not have to see the bloody aftermath of an actual abortion to get the message that something frightening beyond belief was being discussed in this film.  Oh, well.

Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen are at their best in a poignant story of love which developes over time. The chemistry between Natalie and Steve is strong. The beginning of their relationship was not the best, as Natalie and McQueen have a one night stand and Natalie gets pregnant which she and McQueen were not happy about. He barely even remembers Natalie. Natalie comes from a very strict Italian catholic home. Tom Bosley is in the movie as a family friend who is willing to marry Natalie but she doesn't want to. McQueen arranges an appointment with an ""unreliable"" doctor to solve their problem, but things don't go well. I've been holding my breath on that for years. I don't know what the problem is why they can't release this good movie. Both Natalie and McQueen are gone now and its so nice to see them in this movie together. I am still waiting.

324055,4,6301216113,"It feels very light, but it manages to pack a punch, and for that I give it major props.  `Love with a Proper Stranger' is a very sweet and moving film that is easily enjoyed and very memorable.  Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen are a wonderful pair, playing off one another beautifully with charm and sincerity, and the script is wonderfully moving (if not a tad corny in scenes).

The film focuses on Rocky and Angie.  Rocky is a ladies man, a bachelor who floats from one girl to another without any real commitment involved.  That all changes when he gets Angie pregnant and is forced to start making some intelligent decisions.  Angie has to deal with a family that is far too interested in her business, her brother especially making it his business to watch and protect her to a fault.  Rocky is almost detached from the whole situation until his guilt gets the better of him and he starts to invest himself in Angie and her predicament.  What follows next is a delicate look at a blossoming relationship.

Like I mentioned, the film feels very light.  It is not one of those movies that is heavy with thought provocation so it tends to breeze right on by, but there are moments that pack a wallop, especially the `attempted' abortion scene.

The performances are delightful here, especially by the two leads.  Natalie Wood (who received an Oscar nomination for her performance) is stunning as Angie, managing to balance out her emotions quite effectively.  Steve McQueen had a busy year in 1963, and this is just one of a slew of very well crafted performances.  Herschel Bernardi is great as Dominick, Angie's overly concerned brother and Tom Bosley (from `Happy Days') is magnificent as the kind hearted Anthony Columbo.

Parts of the script are a tad over the top and unsuccessful when attempting to be funny (the dinner scene with Anthony's family is particularly irritating) but the films warm moments make up for that.  It's briskly paced and very enjoyable; a nice way to pass the time.  I'd recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on a copy.

324057,5,6301216113,"Two films that tackle the difficult question of how to deal with an unwanted pregnancy are the 1963 classic Love With The Proper Stranger, starring Steve McQueen and Natalie Wood, and the 2006 film Bella, starring Eduardo Verastegui and Tammy Blanchard. Both films are wonderful for different reasons. I give Love With The Proper Stranger 5 stars simply for the script and acting, which are superb. I give Bella 4 stars overall.

In Love With The Proper Stranger, directed by Robert Mulligan, McQueen is a musician that has to face the responsibility of having gotten a girl he can barely remember (Natalie Wood) pregnant; and Wood has to decide what to do about it so her overly protective Italian-American family doesn't go berserk. She and McQueen decide to seek an abortion during a time when that was illegal; so it means sneaking around alley ways and dealing with less-than-reputable people. When they come face-to-face with the horrors involved, they change their mind. Plan B for Wood is to marry another man that is in love with her (Tom Bosley), making him fully aware of what he's getting with the deal, but keeping the truth from her family. In the mean time, McQueen has fallen in love with her. But they have a hard time getting along. And Wood has told him that if she can't have ""banjos and bells"" from him - a line from the fantastic theme song by Jack Jones - she's not interested.

In Bella, directed by Alejandro Gomez Monteverde, Verastegui is a cook that has to overcome a tremendous setback: in a previous time of life, he was a soccer star that was involved in a car accident on the day he was turning pro - ending his career when he has to do time in prison. Now he is working in his older brother's restaurant, just trying to ""find himself."" Meanwhile, one of the waitresses in the restaurant (Blanchard) is fired for being late and supposedly drunk, but it turns out she's pregnant. She decides an abortion is the only way to deal with the issue because she will not bring a child into a loveless life like hers. But Verastegui is her friend, and will not allow her to deal with this crisis alone. Over the course of a day spent together, Verastegui shows her a lot of love, helping her find a new job and taking her to meet his family - one that is very proud and rich in heritage. Blanchard has no family, so the love she experiences with his overwhelms her - and changes her.

Both of these films take place in New York City and both are beautifully shot - Love With The Proper Stranger in black-and-white by Milton R. Krasner, who was nominated for an Oscar; and Bella in very strong color. Both are also comedies - which is interesting, considering the subject matter. But it takes humor to cut the seriousness of an issue like abortion. Both couples seriously contemplate abortion, but both change their minds because of love. The big difference between these two films, other than the time periods in which they are set, is the fact that in Bella, the child factors in to the decision; whereas, in Love With The Proper Stranger, it does not. As a matter of fact, the expectant child is not even mentioned, which is strange. The only thing McQueen and Wood are concerned about are their own lives; both Verastegui and Blanchard are concerned primarily with the child.

So, you could say that Love With The Proper Stranger is pro-abortion and Bella is pro-life; except that in both cases, the couples end up doing the right thing. And in Love With The Proper Stranger, the parents of the child end up together. Both films are interesting from the standpoint of how the couples deal with the question both personally and culturally; and both are interesting from the standpoint of how they change. As I said, it is love that changes them in both cases.

These are great films for mature audiences. Love With The Proper Stranger is unrated and Bella is PG-13. As far as awards, Love With The Proper Stranger was nominated for 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Natalie Wood and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay for Arnold Schulman.

Pakula immediately teamed again to make this semi-forgotten 1963 blend of topical drama and romantic comedy. Set in working class Manhattan, Alan Schulman's perceptive screenplay focuses on the travails of a couple of young Italian-Americans - Angie Rossini, a Macy's salesgirl feeling suffocated by her family and Rocky Papasano, a loose-cannon jazz musician living with a stripper. A one-night stand has produced an unwanted pregnancy, and the movie is frank in how it deals with abortion, an option that was illegal and done dangerously in backrooms back then. Instead of focusing on the moral questions, the movie deals primarily with how the two stumble toward a relationship that neither are prepared to accept in light of the circumstances. It's this uncommonly mature perspective that prevents the film from feeling overly dated 45 years later. On the other hand, the plot structure is uneven as it moves from a character study to a social drama to a romantic comedy in pretty quick order over its 102-minute running time.

Fortunately, the movie boasts two attractive leads to carry the storyline to the finish line. Although her pronounced New York accent wavers at times, Natalie Wood gives a strong performance as Angie, especially in the scenes where she silently conveys her character's emotions. Just beginning to take on leading roles, Steve McQueen proves to be a surprisingly adept comic actor as Rocky. Together, their chemistry is combustible. Except for Edie Adams' comic turn as slatternly, dog-loving stripper Barbie, the rest of the cast falls into stereotypical ethnic roles. However, Herschel Bernardi (the voice of Charlie the Tuna on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starkist/dp/B000CR3YVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starkist</a>&nbsp;commercials) creates a vivid impression as Angie's overprotective brother Dominick, while Tom Bosley (Mr. Cunningham on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Days/dp/B000291Q3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Days</a>) makes his film debut as the poor, all-thumbs schlub competing with Rocky for Angie's affection. Milton Krasner's crisp black-and-white cinematography is noteworthy here, in particular, with the compelling use of real locations. Still not on DVD, the film is most worthwhile to see Wood and McQueen in their prime. Sadly, they would both die prematurely a year apart in 1980-81.",1206921600,11,2892,6.691489361702128

324096,5,6301216113,"I first discovered this movie in 2001, and even now, I still love see it.  I can't wait until the DVD comes out so that I can skip to my favorite scenes.  I am a BIG Natalie Wood fan.  She wasn't the best actress of her time, but she had this uncannily, spellbinding beauty, vulnerability and sweetness that emanates on the screen.  This particular film epitomizes and captures those traits that are hard to find nowadays with the new crop of actresses.  Though you can study this film from a feminist and cultural perspective, I watch it for its romance and great chemistry between McQueen and Natalie.  I also fell in love with Steve McQueen in this movie.  As cynical as I am about the ""knight in shining armor"" motif, I like that his character was flawed and that he had genuine affection for Natalie's character.  Someday I may not be the dreamy, nostalgic person that I am now, but I will always love the unabashedly poignant and romantic ending of this classic film.",1178928000,14,973,4.551724137931035
324097,5,6301216113,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Why can't people get it in DVD? I've been waiting years!

The last reviewer suggests it's due to conservatives like me. I doubt it. ""Love with the Proper Stanger"" is a love story -- which I very much like. I'm fairly certain I'm not the only conservative out there that feels the same way.

I don't care what your politics are -- a good story is a good story. Let's get this one out there!",1157068800,61,428,4.144578313253012
324098,5,6301216113,"Sweet but cynical, this Robert Mulligan film seems strangely modern despite its slightly dated plot (illegal, back-alley abortions, thank goodness that's something we no longer have to worry about). Natalie Wood, scoring her third and final Oscar nomination, and Steve McQueen, in their only on-screen pairing, shine in their realistic, touching portrayals as two working class Italian-Americans who find themselves in a dilemma after a one-night stand. Angie (Wood) is pregnant, and Rocky (McQueen), attempts to help her to pay for termination of the unwanted pregnancy. Things don't go as planned, and he finds himself in the middle of a conflict between Angie and her protective brother, Dominick (Hershal Bernardi), when Angie refuses to marry him. Although the viewer knows that they are right for each other, the pair maintain a defiance against the attraction, refusing to give into romanticism which could have turned the film into a forgettable, sappy love story. Their naturalistic and cynical views on love and marriage give this movie the bite and redeeming qualities that keeps it afloat. Strikingly photographed in black and white, against the gritty New York backdrop, with wonderful, elegant but simple costumes by Edith Head, Wood and McQueen both give perhaps the best performances of their careers. Bernardi, as Angie's overprotective brother, is a lovable annoyance, while Tom Bosley, as Angie's would-be suitor, Columbo, brings an endearing comic relief (clumsy!), and his sisters and that mother of his - classic Italian mama! The same can be said for Angie's occasionally hysterical, traditional, guilt-inducing mother - ""Go and be a mother in America! Day and night you watch her, day and night! You take her here, you meet her there, you wait all day, afraid that some lunatic might grab her in the street!"" Or, my personal favorite, ""Yes, in my grave, I'm going to rest!"" Edie Adams, billed third but in a rather small (but showy) role, is fantastic as the showgirl Barb, in her classic early 60s apartment and her little doggies - great reaction expression when she finds Angie using her shower!

Gently scored by Elmer Bernstein, the little radio rendition we briefly hear in the warehouse sequence ""I could fall in love with the proper stranger, if I heard the bells and banjos ring . . . . . . ."", which gives the plot another boost, letting the leads subtly spark off one another as they discuss the clich' of love. ""Oh, how they build things up - in the books and all the movies - 'how the world comes to an end the moment your lips touch mine' - how they brainwash you."" Natalie's large, luminous eyes draw the viewer in, as does Steve's tough-guy vulnerability, which Angie exposes, with her charming line, ""You know, if you didn't try so hard to play against it, you could be a pretty decent kind of a person.""

Love does win out, in a rather unconventional but fabulous climax - it's utterly right and I'm amazed that this film is becoming difficult to find and has never really gotten the recognition it deserves. A DVD print needs to be commercially available - VHS copies seem to be disappearing.

And remember - better wed than dead!",1148083200,19,3173,4.916044776119403

324100,5,6301216113,"For reasons that only right wingers can know, this movie which was up for five academy awards including best actor (Steve McQueen) and best actress (Natalie Wood), seems not worthy of trasnfer to DVD.  The film explores the terror that young women went through in the fifties and sixties when they attempted to obtain then very illegal abortions.  Although the couple portrayed is from the lower middle class, the route Ms. Wood takes to the Bronx is the same that women and girls of all classes and races took during that period.  It is a great movie in its own right but it has historical consequences that seem to be getting stifled these days.  The movie did end on what today would seem a traditonal and conservative note but it is the intensity of the road to abortion that ALL young people who have lived post Roe v. Wade ought to see before they make up their minds on behalf of everyone besides themselves.  Elsewhere someone referred to what is going on as part of a ""velevet censorship.""  It surely isn't velvet but it is absolutely censorship  [addendum from a reader of this review:  the film is available on DVD but Amazon never seems to stock it so the velvet glove - or sledge hammer - resides right here.]",1120089600,9,1222,4.5479452054794525

324145,3,6301216113,"This is a cute movie that begins with the two lead characters trying to get rid of their ""problem."" They don't know each other beyond a one-night stand. Angie was looking for love, the kind she saw in movies and read about in books, and Rocky, a playboy-type, was just looking for a good time. The entire movie follows them: first they attempt to have an abortion; second, Rocky tries to do the ""honorable"" thing and marry Angie; third, Angie bravely moves out of her Italian mother's house and tries to make it on her own. Angie's character is incredibly strong and self-sufficient; she does not allow herself to be pushed into marriage just because she got pregnant. Rocky has many redeeming qualities as well, but he is a womanizer. Overall, a good film about the universal search for love.
The main qualm I have with this film is the rapid progression of Angie and Rocky's relationship near the end of the film. They are extremely attracted to each other, but I found Rocky's willingness to jump into marriage a bit unbelievable. But overall the performances are great, and Natalie Wood, as always, delivers an incredibly believable performance.",1082505600,12,1149,4.808080808080808

Basically about how two grown people, who, each in their own way, behave more like kids, face up to their actions. Heartbreakingly sad  at times, Wood and McQueen's lack of communication and fear almost bring about a catastrophe . . . but determination and resolve bring about a different result. With a great and somewhat gritty look at New York life, and a wonderful but brief performance by Tom Bosley (Howard Cunningham from Happy Days, among other things) you can't help but root for these two to find true love among the dirty glasses, crowded streets and New York's many distractions.",1079049600,9,741,4.880952380952381

Along the way, Steve becomes a more upstanding guy and the two discover love with all the bells and banjos, right in the middle of a busy New York City intersection.
Steve McQueen radiates sensuality here, and really seems like the kind of guy who could sweep an innocent young thing off her feet.

324152,5,6301216113,"McQueen and Wood are outstanding as a foot loose musician and a Macy sales clerk respectively in New York City.  Even in a city of millions you still get involved with the lives of two families.  While McQueen and Wood are standouts, the supporting cast help make this a solid and memorable film.

The movie begins with an empty hall and quickly it turns in to a musicians hiring hall.  Here is where we first meet McQueen and Wood.  Wood is coming to see McQueen about the after effects of a one night stand a few months earlier.  Naturally, the woman remembers the man, but the man doesn't have a clue.  What makes it tougher for McQueen is that he already has a girl friend when he meets Wood again.  Eddie Adams is great here as McQueen's suffering girlfriend.  When McQueen asks about maybe getting her help for a friend who needs a doctor for his pregnant girlfriend, the result is predictable but Adams is superb as she makes her opinion known.

The families of these two people are a great contrast.  The family of Wood, all brothers and a mother are suffocating her with their concerns about her.  Her brother picks her up from work in the family truck.  Her mother is of the old world.  McQueen's on the other hand have accepted that he is out on his own and seem to be used to his occassional appearences.

The scenes dealing with the solution to Wood's ""problem"" are chilling.  Waiting on a windblown street for a contact.  Both trying to be inconspicuous and worry that they have enough money for the ""doctor"".  When the contact shows, he tells them that they have enough for the ""doctor"" but not for his fee.  They are given a deadline and then they set off to dig up the money.  McQueen knows his folks will give him some money so he heads with Wood, to see them at a local playground.  Here it turns into a race as Wood's brothers show up looking for her and they are also racing the clock to see the ""doctor"".

The actual back alley setting is sobering and a real shock of reality as it was in the years leading up to Rowe v. Wade.  This is a good reminder about what an abortion involved.  No sterile technique, more a process to keep the people from getting too blood stained.

This is not a lived happily ever after story.  You don't know what happens to them other than that they both have a change of heart about each other.

This is a must see movie for any family with teenagers.  It is a good look at the world and is timeless in it's locale.  The black and white photography is excellent and adds a great deal to the visual impact.  New York, as always, provides it's own unique component to this excellent film.

324153,5,6301216113,"Natalie Wood is Angie Rossini, the Macy's salesgirl who gets pregnant by hapless trumpet player Rocky Pampasano, played by Steve McQueen.  When she looks him up to tell him about her problem, he doesn't even remember her but does find a doctor to perform an abortion.  Seeing her in that seedy, back alley situation does something to this basically-nice guy and he rescues her before she has the abortion.  Seeing these two characters bond is a romantic adventure.  From their desperate struggle to raise the money for the abortion to their dinner date where he tries once again to seduce her, I fell in love with watching them fall in love.  Add a hefty heaping of comedy Italian-style to this.  Tom Bosley is classic in his first film as the man hand-picked by Angie's brothers to win her heart.  Her mother has an Oscar-deserving scene when she takes to her bed on hearing of her daughter's out-of-wedlock pregnancy and rants in Italian as she tries to keep this news from the priest.  The priest, too, is classic as the confused man who can't believe Rocky is willing to marry her but the pregnant Angie is refusing.  How could this be?  Because she wants to feel love, to hear bells and banjoes she explains.  And in one of the best scenes in any movie, there is Rocky on the corner by Macy's strumming his banjo, ringing his bells and trying to win Angie's heart.  The course of true love is never smooth, and from their unfortunate beginning to their romantic ending, you'll love watching a most unusual relationship grow.
