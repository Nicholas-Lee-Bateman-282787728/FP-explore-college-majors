8325419,5,B000MGOGJ8,"The Great Courses on Religions is a wonderful learning tool.  The professor is down-to-earth, easy to listen to, and very knowledgeable.  I am using it in a Bible Study group who are not college graduates for the most part, and everyone is able to understand and learn.  The vocabulary used is such that everyone can understand.  The illustrations are clear and helpful.",1306454400,3,370,4.919354838709677
