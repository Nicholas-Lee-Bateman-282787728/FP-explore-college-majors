8109016,3,B000EGD2QE,For 2 guys who had a lot to do with KISS this fell short for me.  I do have to admit though I'm a stickler for details.  I hated the tab.  I like the actual music notes with tab.  The video is helpful but... My suggestion is buy a complete tab book and watch a live video.  I think I've learned more that way than with this video.,1355702400,,330,3.7941176470588234

8109018,5,B000EGD2QE,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this DVD.

Here are two guys who have lived in the shadows of the four original Kiss members - Who are they anyway?  What have they really got to contibute to the legend? etc.

Bob Kulick is the uncredited session player on Kiss moments such as the studio part of Alive 2 and Paul Stanley's solo album.  When Ace couldn't get to the studio, Bob stepped up to play what he calls ""some of Ace's party tricks"".  He has also worked Alice Cooper.

Bruce Kulick is Bob's younger, and just as talented, brother who played lead guitar with Kiss for over 12 years.  He has also toured with Meatloaf.

These guys generously step you thru these great Kiss songs and at times allow you to see inside the Kiss machine.  They are passionate about what they do and are fantastic when they do it.

Oddly, I noted that some of Bob's work happens to be my some of my alltime favourite Kiss moments - after actually giving Ace this credit for so many years!!

I'm not sure I'll ever be able to pick up my guitar and play anywhere near as good as these guys, but was is great to watch them talk about their trade and a treat to simply watch them play.

Total value of money for any Kiss fan or somebody who loves just watching great guitar players doing their thing.",1154044800,4,1292,4.271604938271605
8109019,5,B000EGD2QE,"This is by far the most entertaining and insightful KISS guitar instructional video out there.  Bruce and Bob each share 5 of their favorite KISS tunes that they played on with the band.  Bob was the ghost guitarist for Ace Frehley back in the late 70's and early 80's and his selections cover the ALIVE II studio tracks, Paul Stanley's '78 solo album, and Killers.  All the tunes Bob covers are classic.  He shares some really cool lead tricks that he used in the songs.  Many of which I always thought were done with a tremolo bar, but he's mainly a fixed bridge player.  Nowhere to Run is by far my favorite song on this DVD and Bob does a great job breaking down the song and playing the parts.  Bruce plays selections from Crazy Nights, Hot in the Shade, Revenge, and Carnival of Souls.  Bruce does a great job of explaining his guitar parts on his songs and shows you a couple of CD's from his personal collection on which the songs appear.  Crazy Crazy Nights and Domino are the standout tracks for Bruce and he also does an excellent job on Forever.  With 10 songs jammed on the DVD the guys don't have a lot of time to show you exactly what you need to play.  However, they provide you with a website that has all of the tablature to the songs.  The DVD is the perfect accompaniment to the tablature to give you what you need to nail all the tunes with a little practice.  The Kulick brothers have such a great attitude and it really shines through on the DVD.  You feel like you're sitting in your living room jamming with some old buddies when you watch it.  It also has a bonus feature with Bruce explaining a little about his effects pedal setup.  You were awesome Bruce, but I have to admit that Bob had a much better tone on the DVD.  Highly recommended for any KISS fan or fan of great guitar playing!",1153785600,10,1817,4.312684365781711
