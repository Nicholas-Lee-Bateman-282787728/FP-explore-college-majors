8121590,4,B00000INZV,"As an experienced 5th grade teacher, I've found that 10-year-olds know the difference between ""cutesy"" science videos and factual though fun science videos. Animal Acrobats had them entranced throughout, and when it  was finished they wanted to know when they could see it again.  In the  video, ""Henry"" the lizard was the students' guide to the  ""amazing"" leaps, jumps, runs and other physical abilities his  animals had. Enough time, but not too much, was given to each animal.  The best part, aside from the video's nominal cost, was that they  remembered each animal's unique abilities, even days later.  For  parents and teachers, even if you're not on a budget, this video was a  bargain.",964224000,9,694,5.008771929824562
