4208586,4,B003VADS1E,"Mr Billy Blanks Jr is the son of an American icon when it comes to fitness. His father is the renown creator of the Tae Bo exercise program in the 1980s. This name is devired from Tae (kwon do) and bo(xing).

This DVD represents a shift from his father's Tae Bo routines, to dance routines. So instead of a sparring routine which has its own appeal, there are now dance routines, which have a wider appeal, and is a whole lot more fun. The broadway-style choreography makes it quite enjoyable to join in.

This DVD is 50 minutes long and is broken down as follows:

-> Warm-up: easy moves and light stretches
-> Disco Dance Routine: 70s type moves (like in Saturday Night Fever movie)
-> African Dance Routine: full body moves and lunges
-> Latin Dance Routine: moves that focus on hips, legs and thighs
-> Cool down: deep breathing and cardio toning poses

There is also a breathing technique tutorial that demonstrates diaphragmatic breathing, which can give your body more stamina during your workout and strengthen your core muscles.

The dance routines can be done individually or they can be combined for a full length dance workout. The moves are pretty easy to follow, but still challenging at points. The instuctions inspire and motivate, as the energy of the demonstrators permeate through your screen. At times you may tend to forget that you are working out because of the fun factor. In the end you will be sweaty, but you will feel pretty good.

I recommend this DVD for those who normally find standard exercise DVDs to be boring and a drudgery.",1292198400,60,1560,4.675182481751825

It has a warm up and 4 different segments about 15 min. each  At the end of each workout, there's a power burst that gives you some toning exercises.  They're good!

4208641,4,B003VADS1E,"The dance routines are easy and fun. I would have given it five stars if the DVD went from one workout to the next.  Instead, the DVD stops and you have to manually cue the next dance. This breaks up your exercise.",1424476800,,214,4.095238095238095
4208642,3,B003VADS1E,I find myself having to review the steps several time to get them correct. They don't emphasize the correct form for maximum results. They move from step to step rather quickly. I am not viewing this to learn to dance but to have fun while exercising.,1423958400,,251,4.478260869565218
4208643,5,B003VADS1E,"I bought this DVD because I like to exercise, and I'm a person with NO dance ability or coordination AT ALL, who yearns to be able to dance. I also have difficulty memorizing sequences (for dance). Predictably, I had trouble mastering the moves due to my lack of dance ability. However, I feel that if I practiced this DVD on a regular basis, I would be able to master the moves. The sequences and moves are NOT complicated, and can be learned with practice. The instructors are fun and energetic, and seem to love what they are doing. Their energy is infectious, and I feel in a great mood afterwards too! There is an interesting segment on breathing and developing your lung capacity, but I'm not quite clear on how you can apply it to dance (since you breathe quickly with exertion - not slow and long like in their demonstration). It almost seems kind of meditative, but I found it very interesting. The only time I generally have to exercise during the week is in the morning before work, so the short mix and match segments that you can set to your desired time frame is very convenient! If you have 15, 30 or 45 minutes to exercise - you can set your time length accordingly by the number of dance segments you choose. I would recommend this DVD for the novice dancer. I already have 2 DVD's of Billy Blanks Jr. and his wife (this and one other) And if they happen to release other dance/exercise DVDs, I would certainly buy them. I do not regret the purchase!",1421625600,2,1467,4.437037037037037
4208644,4,B003VADS1E,"I must admit that I have 2 left feet, so any exercise video takes me a while to get into before I get the rhythm.  I am enjoying it and I have only tried the disco set.  There is also African and Latin.  People complained that they got tired of listening to Billy, but I have not reached that point yet.  But I noticed that once you have it down you have the option for music only.  I think it was a good investment.",1420416000,,416,3.9047619047619047
4208645,5,B003VADS1E,Did two other reviews and this is the same.  LOTS of fun and good exercise.  A great break from the very intense Harper and Gilad DVD's (which I also love).  Try these.  You will like them!,1419897600,,189,4.166666666666667

He's really likeable but he had to give too much instruction and kept stopping to do it so it felt like I wasn't getting anything out of it.  I would not buy another one of his workouts.",1412208000,,359,3.863013698630137

4208679,4,B003VADS1E,"I really like this workout. It is fun and it doesn't feel like a workout since you are dancing. Billy and his wife are a little hokey, but that doesn't bother me. Like other reviews said, you may have a hard time learning some of the moves initially, but if you keep doing the workout you will get the hang of it.",1391212800,,313,4.064516129032258

4208681,2,B003VADS1E,"I took Billy's live classes in 24 hour fitness in Studio City, Ca. Love the classes. He is awesome and his wife signing is a bonus. Unfortunately, the dvd not even near as fun. It is not organized workout, it just some mix of dance moves, boring and does not feel like you worked out.",1388361600,,284,4.181818181818182

4208685,4,B003VADS1E,"I exercise with a group of little old ladies and we tried this for aerobics. Some of the choreography is a little challenging for the oldest members of the group, but the rest of us dance along, even when we are a little ""off"" on the steps. It is a pretty good workout if you apply yourself. (Get a little enthusiastic, come on!)
As with most exercise videos, you can't skip all the parts you'd like to skip. (You know what I mean: why do I have to see the intro before getting to the menu the 2nd time I view it?)
Still, we have done the video through all sections now at least 3 times and the group has not yet put it on the pile of never-use-again.",1383177600,,651,4.054263565891473

4208698,2,B003VADS1E,the dancing seemed disjointed and not user friendly. It was not fun and the steps were like an uphill learning curve.  I didn't want and audition to dance.  I wanted a fun dance exercise video.,1377993600,,193,4.485714285714286

4208703,2,B003VADS1E,"I really wanted a better workout. Hip Hop Abs is too youthful... I hoped Billy Blanks Jr.  might be a bit more ""old school"".

4208708,5,B003VADS1E,"First off I am almost 59 years old and have knees that can't handle high impact. A lot of the moves are high impact but Billy Jr. gives low impact options. I love to dance, but am not the greatest dancer. His instruction is excellent so I got most of the moves the first time. I own several dance type videos which I hardly ever do because I can barely hear the music. The music in this dvd is fun. There is also an option to play the music only. Him and his wife are enthusiastic, encouraging and seem like they are having a lot of fun. As for him calling her Wife, I thought it was affectionate teasing, Billy seems proud to have her for a Wife. I have dvds that are very popular right now, but the founder seems very full of himself, and the woman instructor goes on and on about his abs. I love the workout, but found it refreshing that Billy does not seem full of himself. If I could give this workout 10 stars I would. ITS FUN!",1366156800,3,933,4.076086956521739

I saw Billy Blanks Jr. on Shark Tank & know he's Billy Blanks son - whom I LOVE & LOVE all of his Tae-Bo workouts
I had high hopes for this.
I was so bored out of my mind.
The steps were basic & didn't even get my heart rate up.  The final part on final dance routine, for 2 minutes was the only heart pumping thing of the whole workout.
I actually yawned during it & my husband even said, ""You look bored out of your mind""
I wear a heart rate monitor & my heart rate averaged 108.. that's how bad it is.
I'd give it lower - but will say, the 2 minutes of basic arm burns was the only workout I received.  & that's even without weights.  But it still was a good arm workout.",1360108800,3,757,3.778481012658228

4208725,4,B003VADS1E,"This is a positive based workout. I saw Billy Blanks Jr. on Shark tank and liked him right away. It may not be the hardest or give me as much dancy stuff as I'd like but I do get to sweat and the distraction of his method has the workout done in no time. It is very satisfying to me that I can choose the order of the workout. A GREAT idea to give me some control.

Buy this one if for no other reason than to mix up your exercise routine a little.",1355788800,6,448,3.765957446808511

My daughter loves it..says it pushes her but gives her the best workout ever.  It works on all areas, is relatively low impact and the steps are easy to do.  This man is energetic and will get you the workout you need!",1349395200,,344,4.08955223880597

My only problem is no matter how coordinated I want to be I just can't keep up.  I love to try, but I just can't dance.  I can do all the moves as he instructs them but at the end when it all gets put together I am not so great.  I hope that practice will improve that and look forward to continuing to use these videos.",1345334400,2,468,3.7346938775510203

The videos are a fun addition to my workout routine and you will ""break a sweat""!  If you like to dance and burn calories at the same time, these may be the videos for you.  I would say that the level of intensity is geared toward beginners and those of us that are a ""particular age"" with less energy than when we were in our 20's!  Worth the money.",1337731200,22,447,4.162790697674419
4208733,2,B003VADS1E,"I have a dance background so I ordered this thinking it would be fun...it is a decent workout, I was winded during the dvd.

There always seems to be someone that is annoying to look at and the lady in orange is IT. I get dvd's for the purpose of getting a workout, not to watch someone who seems to be auditioning for ""Dance Fever"". I am an avid Jillian Michaels follower and find that I appreciate her more focused approach to exercise. At the end of every session (I did love the African dance section), there are a few seconds where the dancers do a freestyle type dance and it seems more audition-esque than workout-esque and I found it to be very distracting.

I am sure that there are those that will thoroughly enjoy this dvd but it was not for me.",1329091200,,756,4.27972027972028

After participating in the dance exercises, my blood pressure, cholesterol and pre-diabetic conditions all improved to the point that my medication for hypertension has been lowered and I have been kept off of medication for cholesterol and diabetes! This video delivers in so many ways and being critical of people enjoying life is missing the point. It still seems to be the case that those who criticize people dancing are the ones who don't have the courage to get up and dance themselves. It's not about competition, it's about fun!",1314576000,54,656,4.972727272727273
4208736,5,B003VADS1E,"When i first did this video early this year, I was relatively strong and my abs were in ok shape, so I found this workout to be light and a little silly. I forgot about it. But a few months ago I was rear-ended and had to stop working out for a while so as not to strain my muscles. Even a little bit of weight was a strain, and I was in danger of hurting myself. Now am back to normal and have started working out again and on a hunch, pulled it out. Boy, is this a workout! It's tiring and really gets to your different back, abdominal, arm and leg muscles. Also, it forces you to learn moves/footwork that you wouldn't do normally, so you have to concentrate and every time I do it is an opportunity to get better at it. For the people here who say the moves are too difficult, I would say - treat it like you're a child and you just want to move, the more you do it, the better you'll get. So what if the first couple of times you suck? Honestly, I couldn't beLIEVE how different it felt, when I started doing it again, from when I was stronger.

At this point I believe they've really assembled a great series for people who need to just get up and MOVE, getting their heart going and strengthening their bodies gradually so they hardly notice. And given all the back injuries I've had over the last 25 years, I've learned that dancing is one of the best ways to realign yourself naturally. So what if I don't look great when I dance anymore because of back issues, but that's no reason not to do it -- it's the only way to keep yourself from getting worse. (FYI I also do yoga, weight-lifting, skating, cycling, skiing, etc.)",1311292800,33,1631,4.177777777777778

When I couldn't do exactly what Billy was doing I did my own thing.  Just kept moving and had a blast.  This DVD will absolutley be one of my favorites.  I can customize it to suite my schedule and that's a huge plus. Look out Billy Blanks Sr. . . Jr's got me dancing and sweating!",1310169600,10,392,4.038961038961039
4208738,5,B003VADS1E,"The way the videos are set up, it is easy to exercise as long as you want.  You can do one quick 13 minute video or put multiples together to exercise longer and work different muscle groups.  Dance makes it so much easier to get a workout and still feel like you are having fun.  Love, love, love them!!!!!",1306627200,5,307,4.169491525423729
4208739,3,B003VADS1E,"I've been working out for a long time and have many of Billy Blank Sr. videos.  This work-out is OK.  In my opinion it's not quite bad enough to resell, but not good enough to put on the top shelf of my work-out favorites.  Instead I put it on my ""last resort"" shelf - the one I go to when I just want something a little different.
The choreography is interesting, but a little challenging if you aren't used to a 'dancey' work-out.  It took me a few times to catch on to some of the moves, and I have a lot of dance videos. The Disco and African segments are easier and more fun than the Latin one which I found to be difficult to follow.
""The wife"" was the most annoying thing in the whole video.  Billy Jr. was OK - accept that he called her ""wife' instead of addressing her by name which I found to be a little condescending -the work-out team was entertaining and upbeat but ""the wife"" was a little too animated and seemed to be trying too hard to be cool.",1302912000,5,961,4.090425531914893

But the workout itself is a blast (I was surprised that I really enjoyed the African dance the most) and easy to follow. I have no dance experinece and I had very little trouble following Billy Blanks. I chose this DVD because I hate to work out and I'm really enjoying it.

4208746,2,B003VADS1E,"I am a pretty fit person.  In a previous workout, doing belly dance, I twisted my right ankle and had a hard time finding a work out that wouldn't put me in more pain.  So, I started working out with Shaun T's original Hip Hop Abs videos.  I loved the core workout and Shaun T has a very engaging personality.  Now that I have mastered those workouts and am on a plateau, I wanted a nice dance workout.  So, I turned to Billy Blanks Jr.

Every time I perform this workout, I end up with a sore tendon in my left ankle, in which I can barely stand.  Blanks, Jr and his wife have an effetive workout, IF you know how to do the moves.  Unfortunately, Blanks, Jr and his wife don't know how to perform their own moves.  Even worse, neither they, nor the background dancers have any rhythm or natural style for dancing.  If you're going to have a dance work out video, you shouldn't look like you have two left feet or having a seizure.

I am very disappointed in this work out.  Blanks, Jr and his wife are upbeat, but I find their personalities to be a little off putting and the music is catchy and annoying at the same time.  Not an easy feat.

While I did lose weight and gain a flat stomach in the short time I utilized this video, it's not worth it.  What's the point of having a great body if you can't even stand up and go places to show it off?",1294963200,3,1349,4.095419847328245
