3895125,1,B002BLNGUC,"Before you buy this I suggest doing the following:

1.  Google ""Paranormal State fraud"" and/or ""Chip Coffey fraud"" and just research for a few minutes the many hits that will come up.

2.  Read about the two former clients that have come forward with claims of fraud Episodes ""The Messenger"" and ""Hell House"" I believe.  One of their former clients is a self proclaimed psychic.  However before you dismiss her complaints as trying to get ""15 minutes more of fame"" read the whole story.  She was one of the clients in a episode called "" The Messenger"".

This episode had so much evidence that was, let's just say, unfavorable to PRS's credibility that this episode, despite been listed by Amazon as being on the second DVD of Season Two, had been removed from the DVD and you will NOT find it anywhere on Season Two.  The unhappy client posted small parts of that episode on YouTube.  All the posts were quickly removed for ""legal reasons"", despite the fact that other episodes on YouTube have not been as closely guarded by the producers of PRS.

3.  A lot of evidence (to say the least) has surfaced showing that Chip Coffey is briefed well in advance and in great detail by the producers about all the facts on the cases before every showing up on the set.  These are the exact same facts he will later use his ""psychic"" powers to sense.

4.  If you search the IMDB website on Chip Coffey, you will find out that he is, and has been, a professional actor all of his life.

5.  An entire website has been devoted to exposing PRS as frauds, using their own EVP's and video footage.  I cannot list the link here, however if you look up Paranormal State in Wikipedia you will find the site that has captured all of this shows facings/frauds in the references section on Paranormal State.

Hope this helps.",1286150400,3,1804,4.512345679012346
3895126,4,B002BLNGUC,I am currently station overseas and we do not get to see this type of programming on the TV.  I have always enjoyed Paranormal State and this is a good collection of Demon cases.  Looking forward for the newest season in the mail!!,1278028800,,231,4.348837209302325
3895127,5,B002BLNGUC,"I'll admit, before watching any of the Paranormal State offerings on cable or DVD, I will ask for protection of my guardian angel & my God. Good Wrestles evil at all levels, why not while some are in their home watching Paranormal State? Some may ask why one would ask for protection while watching a television show, but ask Chip, Lorraine, and the others who help. I am pretty sure that each one would tell you it's better to be safe than sorry.
Ryan, Serg, Katrina, Heather, ELFIE, Josh, & Chad (who comes in now and again)are the true videographers, EVP users, and all their various technical tools (YES TOOLS), they should be the ones who decide what hits the copy room floor & what doesn't. I wish The team were able to do all the editing and producing. Both Chip Coffey & Lorraine Warren are tremendously gifted. Their talents should be appreciated by all. Each one of the core team brings their own gifts, and talents to the viewers' experience while watching. It is difficult to quantify the talents of every person who aides the Paranormal State Society. I do not have the experience, I simply began watching due to some incidents in my childhood.
I not only have this DVD set, I have both of the complete Seasons 1 & 2 of Paranormal State. Soon, Paranormal State Season 3 will be arriving, it would be fun to have the Paranormal State Society look at what I point out &  find it was something that could not be explained!
I would definitely recommend The Paranormal State: Demonic Investigations to ADULTS only. I do not believe that teenagers should be watching this, I would rate any Paranormal State DVD for only 17yrs+. The actions viewed, especially in Paranormal State: Demonic Investigations, are not actions which should be taken lightly. Yes, this is entertainment. Yes, parents will decide that is okay or not for their children to watch. As a parent, I would not show any of these shows to children under the age of 17! If your child is being plagued by some entity, contact the team. They will help you.
I hope & pray the team of Paranormal State remains safe. I do dearly wish Paranormal State was an hour long this coming season. I plan to preordered Season 4 very soon!
Oh, btw, if you are looking for answers about everything you may have experienced of have seen on the show, you probably will watch and come away with more questions, not less.",1272844800,,2372,4.581176470588235

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

""Paranormal State"" also leans a little bit too much, perhaps, on Catholicism, but I love the protection chant: ""The Light of God Surrounds Us. The Love of God Enfolds Us. The Power of God Protects Us."" It's a great mantra!!!

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

3895129,5,B002BLNGUC,"I agree that Ryan is doing a great job.  Sometimes I wonder if everything is the truth but that is only because it scares me and I wish it wasn't the truth.  Ryan does not call out demon, the others do.  He may think there is a demon possible and then he will call on a medium etc. and they will tell him if it's a demon or not.  He is not crying out demon.  I grew up in a haunted home.  It was a duplex.  Our parents hid most of it from us, but now that I am older, we talk and it all makes sense.  The things my mom pushed aside or had excuses for then, sound crazy now.  We really do believe that there was evil on the other half of the house and good on our side.  The good on our side was always battling the evil next door in order to keep us safe.  For that reason my mother didn't want to get rid of anything on our side.  I also babysat in a house that had some horrifying things happen.  I grew up Catholic and I really didn't believe in the bad after life.  I thought Heaven was the only thing.  God forgave every person.  After the bad experience in that house I sat in, I am a complete believer in evil and Hell.  So, this show is amazing because it doesn't just show you there is or may be a ghost.  It is showing reality.  Also, in many cases, these demons are invited it.  Tell me that worshiping the devil doesn't cause consequences.  O.K., thanks for listening to my opinion.",1262822400,15,1394,3.96028880866426
3895130,5,B002BLNGUC,"First of all ""Everyone has there own opinion"". Mine just happens to come from a Christian point of view. And in my experience ""Demons do exist, and there attacks are a  lot more often than most people think"". That's why I like this show. It just dosen't just cover the Ghost angle.
I enjoy Ryan's approach to the whole situtation and not just a portion of the problems.
And yes I too have had the bad experiences with the supernatural.",1262044800,10,435,4.4375
3895131,5,B002BLNGUC,Paranormal State airs on television and  A & E network on Tuesday evening. It is a great show. This show is based on the teams investigations into demon hauntings. It is interesting and somewhat frightening. The crew is very professional and met and established the group at Penn. State University. If you feel that your house or place of business is haunted you can request this group come to investigate. They take all complaints very seriously. The group brings in psychics as well as Priests if it is warranted.,1261008000,2,515,4.786516853932584
3895132,5,B002BLNGUC,"Personally, I absolutely disagree with a previous reviewer who provided the show with 1 star just because of ""a demonic force is rare."" Further, it is very mean and unfair to accuse Ryan in some sort of ""religious views"" which, in that 1 star reviewer's opinion, ""get in his way of being an impartial investigator, and that is why he so frequently cries ""Demon"""" Sounds ugly, isn't? What has really happened here is that 1 star reviewer has projected their personal lack of comprehension and lack of sensitivity. It seems like that 1 star reviewer has never seen any other episodes of Paranormal State besides this particular DVD, which is solely dedicated to all 5 demonic cases, extracted from each of four seasons during 4 years of Paranormal State. First of all, it is true - a demonic force IS rare, and any priest can tell you that, there is no need to be a rocket scientist to digest this notion. However, for the past four years PRS has become very popular among the American public - and Ryan is receiving hundreds of letters on a daily basis, where people are crying for help from all over the country. The majority of these people have exhausted all their resources available to the public, and PRS is truly their last hope and last resort. It is clearly said within each episode of Paranormal State that only the most difficult cases are chosen for investigation.  Therefore, no wonder that in 4 (four) years of constant investigations of hundreds of the most difficult cases, PRS accumulated only 5 (five) episodes of demonic encounters from all over the US. This clearly indicates that a demonic force IS rare. Thus, the statement of that 1 star reviewer makes no sense in regard to Ryan. Second of all - Ryan possesses a huge heart filled with kindness, sensitivity, and empathy towards every single one of his clients. Ryan never leaves any of his clients without providing them with a specific professional help. Ryan always follows up on each of his clients for many months after the case is closed in order to make sure that they are being helped in their recovery from a trauma. Depending on a particular client's issues and emotional condition, Ryan always provides them with a variety of professional help in each episode - whether he invites a Psychic, a Medium, a Psychotherapist, a Psychiatrist, a Counselor, a Priest of any Christian denomination, an Indian Shaman, just name it! - So, what sort of Ryan's ""religious views"" is it that 1 star reviewer is talking about? Who is Ryan - a Christian, a Shaman, a Pagan, an Atheist, a Scientist, or anyone else? Maybe Ryan is all at once?! How possibly one may judge Ryan's ""religious views"" without having a clue what those views are about and if they're religious at all? Unless Ryan met that 1 star reviewer in person and secretly confessed about his personal religious beliefs, which I doubt very much so. Don't you?",1259539200,15,2890,4.7227722772277225

3895134,1,B002BLNGUC,"You know, you'd think by watching this show Demons were hiding in every nook and cranny. Talk to anyone who legitimately investigates the paranormal and you'll find that encountering a genuine demonic force is rare. Talk to the catholic church and ask how many exorcisms have been performed in the last decade. Not many. Yet this show seems set on the notion that almost every haunting is somehow demonic. Personally I think that Ryan's personal religious views get in his way of being an impartial investigator, and that is why he so frequently cries ""Demon"".",1255478400,7,560,4.905263157894737

3895137,5,B002BLNGUC,"Ryan's work is equivalent to about 20 stars. I'm into anyone who puts their heart into it, and first foot forward on just about anything that arises.

3895139,4,B002BLNGUC,"I have to admit I love watching this show and this special edition DVD.  I do believe in spirits, both good and bad and well as God, Jesus, the Holy Ghost, and Satan.  I have to question the validity of the show for a few reasons of my own observations.  One, the generally never show you any major ""evidence"" while its occurring.  Sometimes they show things after the fact (which could easily be staged).  Also, the constant ""Give me a sign! Move something!"" and when any kind of noise occurs they're like ""Holy $#!+, did you hear that!?""  By now they should be used to things that go bump in the night.
The other thing that just makes no sense to me is that they'll call in a priest who will perform is rites on screen and follow and allow crew to taunt and call out demons.  I would think that a priest would put a kibash to something so potentially dangerous being done by someone not of the cloth.  Also, if I was around a priest or church leader of any kind, I would NEVER swear and cuss and behave the way they sometimes do.  And if I was the priest I would certainly not just sit idly by while people whom I'm with were speaking and acting in this fashion.
Aside from that, again I want to say I love this show.  I like how the crew has such a compassionate approach with the clients they are working for.  Its a nice change from other ""ghost hunting"" shows that think everything has to be done in the dark even when their clients say they see full body apparitions in daylight.  And they think that some ""EVP"" that sounds like nothing is supposedly a message.  Others go out of their way to find proof where PRS takes a more open-minded approach.",1350000000,,1655,4.266025641025641

3895143,4,B002BLNGUC,"This Demonic Investigations is pretty good. It shows in a way how so many things, people, entities, spirits, ghosts, demons, etc.. are all connected in a certain way to many of the things that happen to people everyday on a paranormal level. Although I'm very much a believer because of what I've seen and experienced many times in my own life; I'm only here to review what I saw with demonic investigation.

  When you're dealing with this type of subject matter, there's always a real element of creepiness, fear, and can be pretty scary to see these things that really happen to people. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. They get some things on film but alot of it is more based on the reactions of others than anything we actually see.

  I think if you're going to make a show about this, show us everything. Of course things have to end up on the editting room floor but I didn't buy this just to watch other ppl's faces and reactions when something is happening in front of them. I want to see what's happening in front of them that everyone is reacting to. Why are you showing me Chip's astonished and fearful face instead of what his astonished and fearful face is looking at? For example with the 'I am six' story. You don't see much of anything that actually happens.

  You'll see ppl having a conversation outside saying ""OMG did you see the way her face contorted? Did you hear her voice change? She didn't blink for 20 minutes. Her face completely changed"" etc etc.. I can see they're freaked out but they didn't show any of the things they're talking about. This is how most of the whole show is. It's still good but when a show like 'A haunting' does re-enactments with actors and actresses that show more than what is on film for real right in front of them, something isn't quite right about what we're seeing.. or in this case, not seeing.

  I'm tired of watching Ryan yell or watching ppl run with no clue what he's yelling about or why anyone's running beyond what they say they saw. If someone says there's alot of activity in one particular room, why not have a still infrared camera set up in that room? Instead we have to rely on hand held cameras that usually catches nothing for us, but we see them react over something they saw out of the corner of their eye.

  Again, it's a good show. You'll get a few jumps and some scares out of it. There's plenty of creepy sounds and noises that catch you off guard. But I just wish there was more being shown of what they're seeing than having the cameras focused on the crews reactions to it. After the 1st season of Paranormal State, it's gone downhill a bit from what we came to know, expect, and really like about Ryan and the gang.",1303344000,2,2713,4.398
3895144,5,B002BLNGUC,"I am a HUGE fan of the show, ""Paranormal State,"" so this DVD was a must-get for me. It goes through their most severe demonic cases thus far.
