5672725,5,B00BTI252S,Excellent workout for obese beginners.  It allows you to have a decent workout without feeling like collapsing afterwards.,1477612800,2,122,5.777777777777778
5672726,5,B00BTI252S,"This DVD is everything I was looking for!  It gave me the courage to take the first step in taking charge of my health.  Even those with limited mobility will be able to get a good work out.  It progresses in such a way, with the three different workouts, that it can be used at different stages of fitness as you progress along your journey.  In 3 weeks I am down 21 lbs, and I feel so much stronger!  I LOVE Beth!  She is authentic and encouraging.  It's obvious she is sincerely interested in helping others overcome obesity!  I would reccomend this video to anyone who needs to take the first step to reclaiming their health and getting back into life!",1468368000,5,656,4.363636363636363
5672727,5,B00BTI252S,"I'm 60 and obese. The exercises are challenging yet doable. The instructors are encouraging and real - not teeny-bopper cheerleaders. The realistic approach makes me want to join in, rather than look for excuses to put it off. I feel like Goldie and I are buddies in this together.",1456876800,5,281,4.755102040816326
5672728,5,B00BTI252S,"AWESOME DVD, has lost me lose 80#'s.",1424995200,,36,4.285714285714286
5672729,5,B00BTI252S,"Ive been doing this DVD for the past few weeks, several times a week and I have to say Im enjoying it. I started out with the chair routine but moved on to the standing routine. Some days I do standing other days I do the chair routine. I feel like I get a good workout.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone whos hesitant about exercising to give this DVD a try.",1424217600,2,363,3.9726027397260273
5672730,5,B00BTI252S,This is a wonderful DVD for all levels of physical abilities.  Beth is very knowledgeable and knows her stuff!,1409529600,3,110,4.7894736842105265
5672731,5,B00BTI252S,"This looks great.  I've watched it once and did a little bit. I think it will be really good for me. She is encouraging, but not overly cheesy. If you are really overweight this is the exercise dvd for you. I'm really glad I found it.  I can't do a full 30 minute session yet, but it feels pretty good to move. If anything starts to hurt then you stop and try the next exercise.  Very gentle.  If I remember, I'll add to this review after I've done it for a while.",1407283200,10,464,4.010869565217392
5672732,5,B00BTI252S,"My wife and are are not overweight, but we are ""under fit.""  We have enjoyed  using GETTING BACK INTO LIFE regularly several times a week, most often together, to improve our strength and muscle tone.  The Chair Routine is our favorite.  I feel much better after doing the exercises, and they have definitely trimmed my paunchy waist.  I really like the music, too.",1405382400,10,365,4.73015873015873
5672733,5,B00BTI252S,this is my second purchase.the video has helped me loose weight and keep active while at home during winter months.,1389139200,10,115,4.8
5672734,5,B00BTI252S,"I have been doing the sitting version of this video and it is a great workout. I have arthritis in my knees and many exercise routines are painful. This video lets you workout at your pace in three different positions - bed, chair, and standing. I highly recommend it if you are limited in your mobility or have difficulty exercising. It's just 30 minutes and with three different levels would be a good warm up even for those who have an easier time exercising.",1364428800,11,462,4.511904761904762
8573642,5,B00BTI252S,Wonderful workouts!  Different levels of challenge with beginning options and moving up at your own pace.  With arthritis in my knee this is giving me a good way to do cardio without straining or overworking my knee.  Incorporates most of the exercises and stretches I am familiar with in a fun and challenging manner.  This is helpful for me to work on improving my coordination in sections where arms and legs are moving together or up tempo of moving my whole body.  This will keep me busy for awhile to fully master all of what is in these workouts!,1527465600,,553,4.545454545454546
8573643,5,B00BTI252S,The sitting exercise routine was very helpful. I cannot do standing exercises or laying exercises so this was a blessing in disguise. The therapist on the video is very compassionate and golden is very encouraging.,1522886400,,214,5.142857142857143
8573644,4,B00BTI252S,"This was not purchased for myself. The young lady that I gave it to said it was a pretty good video. She states that it would be nice to choose which exercises, laying, sitting or standing but apparently you have to go thru the video to get to each type.",1514073600,,254,4.1
8573645,5,B00BTI252S,"I struggle with severe degenerated osteoarthritis and have very limited motion. This allows me to work at my own pace, perform exercises that I'm able to do without feeling like a failure. There are very little options for people with severe pain and limited movement so this DVD provides great choices for exercising.",1511481600,,318,5.018867924528302
8573646,5,B00BTI252S,This is a great video!,1510704000,,22,3.6
8573647,5,B00BTI252S,Good workout DVD even when sitting down.  I was amazed & pleasantly surprised at what a great workout it provided.,1509753600,,114,4.7
8573648,1,B00BTI252S,"This is the most annoying video I've ever watched.  This doesn't make me want to work out, it makes me want to avoid it.  She keeps mentioning obesity.  Do you really want to be reminded that you are obese?",1498608000,,206,4.230769230769231
8573649,1,B00BTI252S,"Dont get this. Annoying music, instructor, set. So cheesy. Also the instructor  is a Physical Therapist who is kind of lax with the idea of form.  The woman named Golden, who is doing the modification is not even with the instructor, they just cut to her somewhere else now and then.  I loved her and would want to see her for the full time not just sporadically. Weird video, but a great idea with the obesity crisis in the country, however poor execution.",1487376000,,457,4.481927710843373
8573650,3,B00BTI252S,"kinda cheesy, but ideal for morbidly obese people.  i (thankfully) can handle something a bit more than this.",1483056000,,109,5.055555555555555
8573651,5,B00BTI252S,Awesome. It really works!,1478044800,,25,5.5
