3650278,1,B001IYAJG2,"This movie had godawful ""production values"" throughout.  Bad acting, bad script, poor editing, directing, settings, fake accents, you name it, there is very little in this movie that was done without complete incompetence.  At times, the film-makers seemed to be going for a parody of Nazi exploitation flicks.  At some point, they even interject goofy jazz music and cartoonish sound effects.  Other times, they try to be deadly serious with torture, mutilations and atrocities.  None of this works on any level. If you spend any time or money on this, you will regret it.",1244332800,3,573,5.053191489361702
3650279,5,B001IYAJG2,"If you liked ""The Toxic Avenger"" and ""Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS"", then this is up your alley all the way! A bad self indulgent script, horribly innacurate uniforms for most of the 'soldiers' (with the exception of some reenactors who helped out from the area that I know...) uber-cheesey special effects, nudity, bad taste, bad acting, and cheap production values all make this a film that Leonard Pinth Garnell (Dan Akyroyds film snob charactor on SNL) would say is 'deliciously bad and aweful, and I liked it very much'... right up there with 'Video Chicken 1' from 'bad conceptual art'.... I mean, you will love hating this movie and cringing at each horrible moment... fortunately the nude chicks are pretty hot and drooling at them should help to ease the pain of the rest.
It is violent, pretentious, and just so frigging BAD you have to sit in amazement that any group of people could put together such an unending group of bad things together and make it work... sure to become a cult classic, and I think that is what the director-producer wanted, so I give him 10 stars for assembling a truly horribly bad array of awefulness... and like Akyroyd's bad art snob, I liked it very much!
Not for the squeamish, however, it is like a bad slasher flick in a death camp... but so bad and poorly done its funny in a bad way. Way bad!
If you like bad funny or funny bad this one's for you! Also check out ""The world's greatest sinner"" if you like bad funny funny bad.
This one is a fake follow up to the old porn Nazploitation classic ""Stalag 69"" which is real porn in a camp setting, whereas this has no real porn, just a bit of fake stuff, and nudity.
This film is so funny bad, I tried to make my bad funny review as badly funny, or funny badly. Bad fun bad fun BAD!",1244246400,3,1769,4.379939209726444
3650280,5,B001IYAJG2,"This is an affectionate tribute to the many Naziploitation films of the past. Shot on a very low budget this film contains every one of the elements that make these films so popular, evil Nazi's, sexy women being tortured, Jackbooted Nazi women and bad acting. I recommend this title to people who are fans of such fair from the 70's. It is nice to see someone in the insane PC times we live in capture the feeling of movies like this.",1241481600,3,435,4.382716049382716
3650281,5,B001IYAJG2,"Anyone who picks this up expecting true Naziploitation will be in for a huge surprise. While there is plenty of gore, nudity, and love of the genre to make any true exploitation hound happy as a clam, there is so much more.

Not only do you get a film that is beautifully made. (We're talking great cinematography, editing, ambiance, etc.) But you also get the rarest treat of them all; intelligence. That's right. The true future of independent genre cinema is a nod towards the past with a brain towards the future and ""Blitzkrieg"" is the perfect example of this.

The cast is terrific and help make this movie one of the most memorable fringe films I've seen in a long time. While like any film worth its salt, it is not for everyone. But if you're looking for something that seamlessly blends quality, fun, smart commentary, and the fringe benefits of cult cinema, then this is the movie for you.",1231459200,5,900,4.583850931677019
3650282,5,B001IYAJG2,"i saw blitzkrieg: escape from stalag 69 in a crowded theater. the place went nuts for it. it's an audience movie for sure. imagine if john waters and h.g. lewis collaborated on a ww2 nazi film-and they made it as epic and leisurely paced as a sergio leone spaghetti western. if you can imagine all that blended together seemlessly then you have a good idea about what to expect from blitzkrieg: escape from stalag 69.

  anyone interested in independent/grindhouse/exploitation filmmaking would really enjoy this movie. i would suggest buying it and watching it with your scuzzy punk rock friends if at all possible. prepare to be freaked out, grossed out, and most of all-entertained. you don't need psychoactive substances because the movie itself will trip you out.

  the only warning i will give is that this is obviously a low budget movie and some of the actors are non professionals. for some potential viewers, that's a turn off. however, if you enjoy the films of waters, lewis, findley, fulci and other trash-meisters, then those same characteristics are a turn on. with many classic genres really played out at this point (yes, i'm talking to all you unimaginative dtv zombie flicks that flood the market) it was refreshing to see a new take on nazisploitation.

  i believe that blitzkrieg: escape from stalag 69 is 10 years ahead of its time. in a decade we will either see fangoria pay tribute to it in a 5 page retrospective-or see a young music video director make a shaky cam/avid fart remake; or perhaps both. but for now, we have the original nasty little gem all to ourselves. also checck out the bloody ape, by the same director (it is possibly even more offensive, over the top, and hilarious than blitzkrieg: escape from stalag 69).",1231459200,9,1756,4.807308970099668
3650283,5,B001IYAJG2,"Saw this over the summer in NYC, I think it played in other cities as well. I enjoyed it, it's a true grindhouse/explotation gem. I have pre-ordered my copy already, excited to see  the movie again as well as the behind the scenes interviews and actor commentary.

If you like sex, violence or bizarre subject matter, like I do, then this is a great movie to check out.",1231459200,3,369,4.411764705882353
3650284,5,B001IYAJG2,"Blitzkrieg is truly a treat if you're looking for something different. Well written, well shot, it was made on no or little money but nothing was spared when it came to imagination. I had the pleasure of seeing at the Pioneer Theater during its one week run, and I was blown away by the ambition the film had. Most morons making a horror film these days go the easy way and do pointless slasher or zombie films. Blitzkrieg is a WWII film in the best sense of the word. Yes, it has the violence and horror associated with exploitation films, but it also gives you a great story, good acting, and a reason to keep watching. Well worth your time and money. And the chicks are quite hot as well!",1231286400,5,691,4.323076923076923
3650285,1,B001IYAJG2,"I saw this at the Pioneer too (did it play anywhere else?) and frankly, it offended me.

Please don't get me wrong - I wasn't offended by the content or concept of the film; I've seen far worse, and am a fan of exploitation cinema in general.

I was offended, however, by the terrible script, nonexistent production value, wretched acting, excessive length, and general lack of effort that went into this film.  It looked like it was shot on a 1985 Betamax video camera, or a cellphone.  The dialogue was wooden, ridiculous, and snore-provoking.  The acting was worse.  The male lead, a beefy army guy, must have been high on phenobarbital during the entire filming schedule.  The women were clearly supposed to be eye candy, but missed the mark like a dart missing the wall the dartboard is hanging on.  And at nearly two hours, it almost made me wish I was spending my time sitting in a chartered accountant's office, silently watching them crunch numbers.

This film was abysmal.  It was not ""so bad it's good"".  I'll be the first to sign on for a film of that nature!  But this was so bad it was unwatchable.  They handed out novelty barf bags at the premier; I almost had to use mine, because I felt so sick at having spent money on this vomit.

Don't buy Blitzkrieg.  You will have more fun, and save money, if you buy a cast iron skillet and repeatedly whack yourself in the head with it.",1231200000,5,1395,4.48015873015873
3650286,1,B001IYAJG2,"This movie was one of the most awfully written, awfully shot, horridly disapointing movies I have seen. And I am not talking 'awful' like Santa Conquers the Martians 'awful'; that at least was ENTERTAINING and if you didn't feel like sitting through it, the title already let you know what the ending was.

Bliztkrieg: Escape from Stalag 69 was nothing short of an amateur attempt at a B-movie, filled with gore, sex, violence and... wait. It doesn't really have any of those. Sure, there's some topless women, but they're nothing to shake a stick at. The dialogue is trite to the point it reminded me of 9th grade creative writing classes, where there was always 'that guy' trying to be both funny, crass, and throw in some shock value into his oh-so-well thought out screenplay about zombie ninja hookers riding radioactive dinosaurs through post-Apocalyptic Berlin while fighting off the Red Army, who by the way is made up of transvestites. You remember that kid? He got slammed into the locker banks daily before 3rd period. This movie deserves equal treatment.

The lead's acting is awful. The videography is horrific, with me often focusing more on the blown out, white skies rather than the tepid acting that was occurring on screen. I owe the person who dragged me to this movie a swift smack to the face, and must question why an otherwise reputable theatre picked this up. The title excited me- how can you mess something named ""Bliztkrieg: Escape from Stalag 69"" up? Apparently in countless ways.

If a drinking game was created based on all the faults in this movie, everyone would be too plastered to see straight roughly 10 minutes into the movie. And they would be fortunate, as they would have been spared from the other 125 minutes of blandness this movie delivers.

Buy this movie for someone you hate.",1231200000,4,1821,4.8083067092651754
3650287,5,B001IYAJG2,"I saw this film at the now dearly departed Pioneer Theater this past summer and I have to say that it was one of the best new movies that came out this year.  Forget about the lame, fluffy Hollywood movies and the so called Independent ones that cost millions to make.  This is true independent film making that looks like it cost more to make than it probably really did as the production values are excellent.

The beginning is a little surrealistic and it took just a little while for the film to start hitting its stride, but once it did, the action continued to build and build until it was like all Hell broke loose with the massive carnage at the end.

The film begins with a former prisoner of war camp Commandant hiding out in South America.  Some Nazi hunters try to capture him but he blows them away and goes on the run.  He ends up in a church and confesses all of his atrocities to the priest.  He recounts all of the brutal and hideous crimes that occurred at his POW camp.  Lets put it this way, you wouldn't have wanted to have been at this camp as there were horrible experiments (a great scene shows a doctor carving up a bloody body and we also see some kind of mangled mutant of a person) and all sorts of torture (the Spanish Inquisition would have been proud) including whipping, electrocution, removal of body parts, hangings, thumbscrews, you name it, they got it.  I'm glad that I didn't eat much before seeing this movie because several times I felt like I was going to be sick during the gory scenes.

Anyway, the Commandant and his assistant are like an evil version of Laurel and Hardy.  They are very amusing and I found myself laughing several times during their conversations.  As the prisoners plot to escape from this hellhole, the torture gets more and more brutal.  I won't give away the ending but it is very satisfying.  There were some surprises as there were a couple of characters I thought were going to survive who ended up getting killed.

I'm looking forward to the DVD to rewatch the film because there is a lot to this movie.  For an exploitation flick, the dialogue is surprisingly intelligent and witty without being stupid.  There is even a reference to Shakespeare's Richard III which is pretty cool.  There is supposed to be a lot of outtakes and deleted scenes in this DVD so I'm looking forward to seeing those.  In the theatrical version there was some kind of reference to a monster ape but we never got to see it so I hope that this footage will be in the extras in the DVD.",1229040000,2,2532,4.429805615550756

8311530,1,B001IYAJG2,"Blitzkrieg Escape from Stalag 69 is a micro budget attempt at doing a Nazi exploitation film.  Little effort was made to make the homes and backyards of Long Island look like Nazi Germany.  No effort was made to cast actors who look like starving POWs or who can pull off a convincing German accent.

Well OK, no one is buying something called 'Escape from Stalag 69' for historical accuracy.  But it's not even good exploitation.  There are a few scenes with Tatyana Kot as a Russian Partisan mowing down Nazis wearing combat boots and nothing else.  But that's about it.  The rest of the film is filled with feeble attempts at humor and shockingly bad cinematography.

Save your time and money and stay away.",1331424000,2,710,4.669354838709677

This is a funny, FUNNY, over the top movie, EXTREME and RISKY (in every since of the word) and it is well worth watching. The movie will be a cult classic if it isn't already. Do yourself a favor - BUY this movie and hang on to it. It will be even funnier and better in a few years. So, if you don't like it. To each his own.

8311533,1,B001IYAJG2,"Well, after reading some of the reviews here, I was wondering if my DVD had the wrong disc in it. As what I got was an over talky, prison camp tale, which looked to be set in someone's back garden (probably N.J). A bunch of very overweight marine P.O.Ws and lots of discussion on war, National Socialism, the Eastern Front, etc,  some nudity, some mild torture, and a whole lot more talking. The lighting is pretty poor and so are the sets and locations. There seems to be a real Russian girl (the cover girl) who is a decent actress and has a nice body, but I think she was wasting her energy here (maybe she is Tatyana Kot). I must admit, I couldn't make it to the end of the film... I really did try. It seemed to go on for ever..... well at least I can't spoil the ending for anyone.",1262131200,10,787,4.143790849673203
