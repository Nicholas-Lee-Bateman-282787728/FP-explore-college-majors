8323790,4,B00000INUE,"Amy Lynn Baxter is running a failing vegetarian restaurant. In an effort to improve business she changes the format to one where the waitresses are bikini clad, and brings in Marilyn Chambers to help. Business picks up as might be expected. Back in the kitchen we see all the waitresses topless at one time or another. The plot is predictable, and the women beautiful.",1368057600,,368,4.765625
8323791,1,B00000INUE,"Amy Lynn Baxter stars as Judy, a former actress trying to run a struggling vegan eatery.  Needing a substantial amount of money to keep the landlord from shutting her down, Judy's cousin gets her to enlist the aid of Marilyn Chambers (who Judy worked with in other movies), to try and turn things around.
While I love both B-flicks & Amy Lynn, this movie was difficult to watch.  The acting is harsh, even by B-flick standards and the jokes either don't make sense or just aren't funny.  (Like Judy's cousin purposely sabotaging the food orders.  Why?)  The nude scenes are decent but you will find your attention wandering soon after they're over.
Unless you're a real big Amy Lynn or Marilyn fan, pass on this.",1086825600,,712,4.664
8323792,3,B00000INUE,"Well, what can I say in here that wasn't mentioned in the title.  A bunch of hot chicks want to save a restaurant by wearing binkinies, and we get to see them change into the bikinies and out of bikinies and pretend to make  hot love without the bikinies.  Well, it's an ok rental if you've seen  every other movie with naked chicks in the video store, but othrewise, it's  just boody.  So not worth the 50 they are asking.",945820800,9,423,4.225
