8154202,5,B000K3EB5W,"Purchased this film on DVD a few weeks ago.  It was packaged very nicely.  The quality is beautiful.  The production itself is extraordinary.  It captures the essence of Philadelphia's ""Rittenhouse Square"" the way it is if you were thinking of visiting Philadelphia for a weekend in the summer.  The musicians are the soul of Philadelphia.  It is inspirational for young musicians because it features some young musicians playing their music in the park for visitors to enjoy.  The setting lends itself to music of all kinds.  It also features folks of all ages and their commentaries.  This is a perfect picture to watch as a family because it has something for everyone.  I highly recommend this film to others thinking of purchasing it.  You will not be disappointed.",1358380800,3,770,4.9375
8154203,5,B000K3EB5W,"I just finished watching this excellent documentary on Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia, PA. What can I say? I am transported back to the city of my childhood. I remember the curved stone benches and running thru the park as a little one.
Even if you have no ties to the great city of Philly at all, you will find this film tugs on your heartstrings through the incredible music and the visual feast of humanity. I smiled, laughed, almost cried and got lost in the beauty of nature in the middle of a concrete jungle.
There's just something about the mental picture of a squirrel eating a French Fry but that's okay because it's a Urban squirrel!
Bravo, Mr. Downey. Bravo.",1227571200,2,674,4.578512396694215
8154204,5,B000K3EB5W,"Alright Philadelphia has Fairmont Park which has a lot more in common with Central Park than with Rittenhouse Square Park. The film-directors deserve applause for showing a year in the life of a park but not just any park. If you read and study Philadelphia history like myself, Rittehouse Square Park has never been just a park but has a piece of history, culture, and society all there. There is music because on one corner is the Curtis Music Institute and there is a twelve year old girl on the cover of this DVD who plays the violin brilliantly beyond her years in the park for fun. There are the regulars like Stanley Green, the five time married man who wears his derby, and dies a few days after his interview after a fifth bypass. There are the couples who meet and fall in love. The locals who bring their lunch to the park or meet each other there. In the life of the park, there is a vitality in Rittenhouse Square not often seen in most parks. One person spoke of it as her beach during the summer. If you look at it, it's not a big park. there is no zoo or swimming pool but a fountain. There are benches which don't sit across directly from each other. There are the greens and trees in the middle of urban Philadelphia. Before they built the skyscraper apartment buildings and hotels around the square, there were mansions and residents like John Wanamaker and the ghosts of Philadelphia's past residents who probably still visit the square but that's not what this DVD is about. It's about a tribute to a park and a way of life. Rittenhouse Square reminds me of those parks in London and Paris where urban residents can retreat into the park for a just a moment from their busy lives. Rittenhouse Square is not exclusive for the city's residents but visitors and tourists as well. Friends and lovers meet in the park. Also the size of the park is small enough not to miss your friends, relatives, or make new friends too. You can enjoy listening to beautiful music, play chess, read a book, eat your lunch, listen to your ipods, or observe human nature. Whether it's just a stroll in the park, Rittenhouse Square is welcome to all those who appreciate and love it. It's also a place known to watch the birds and it's not actual birds but ladies or women in their fall or spring fashions and hairstyles.",1219190400,5,2319,4.471698113207547
