7913816,4,B00000JYXB,I have issues with anything William Shatner does but this DVD is notable for the accuracy of the information.,1449792000,,109,4.7894736842105265
7913817,2,B00000JYXB,"This DVD really had me excited. A giant DVD packed with info, pictures, and video of Mars! Wow! Well, the idea is a novel one, it's just not all that great in reality. The menus are a confusing mess of links and you can easily end up really frustrated trying to figure out where you're clicking and what the icon you clicked on means. The DVD is seperated in two categories, operational and interactive. From what I've seen though, both basically have the same content. The interactive branch just offers more easter eggs and a more or less hands on approach to accessing the materials. This is where the DVD went from cool idea to being tossed into the island of misfit DVDs. The content should be easy to navigate through. It is not. You never know how to get to anything! Why couldn't they just categorized the pics and video into single menus listed as video and pictures?! They pretend to use this approach but the execution is far more nefarious. The DVD was obviously made to allow the user to ""uncover"" secret video clips or info but this approach just lead me to turning the thing off. The information is entertaining and educational but even the info is more or less abrupt, giving us the cliff notes version of Mars missions etc. The box also suggests that there is over 2,000 photos and something like 200 video clips. Yeah right! More like a hundred photos and a dozen video clips. I'm sure there are more in there somewhere but finding them becomes a thankless and unfun effort. This could have been a great DVD and while alot of what's on this disc is good to have, it's just not worth buying. Save some money and go to the library and rent some books on Mars instead.",1052092800,8,1683,4.467532467532467
7913818,2,B00000JYXB,"The interface is confusing. The scenes are presented without any explanation, then since you don't know what is it that your are looking at, the whole sequence becomes boring. The sound is not very good, additionally, the close caption is practically inexistent.",991094400,,262,5.261904761904762
7913819,5,B00000JYXB,"Unlike the previous reviewer of Mars: The Red Planet, this is a fantastic product!  Not only does it provide a great deal of fantastic video, but the web interface is the key to an emergent technology that will revolutionize  home education and entertainment in the early-twenty-first century. Soon  DVD players at home will be embedded with a chip that allows home users,  connected to the Internet, to bring a web interface onto the home monitor  or display and bring real-time imagery and data directly into their home.  Titles such as Mars: The Red Planet will be constantly updated with new  information making these dynamic documentaries and encyclopedias of  information and imagery.
So bottom line:  As an example of the future  of value-added entertainment and education titles, Mars: The Red Planet  should not be missed.  For now, enjoy the power of exploration on your  DVD-ROM connected the Internet. Tomorrow, get ready for the future of  interactive multimedia like never before.",940809600,16,994,5.169811320754717
