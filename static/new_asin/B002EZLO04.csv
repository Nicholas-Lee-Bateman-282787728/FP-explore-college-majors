3920669,3,B002EZLO04,"It did not seem so much an educational documentary as it did a jump around ""ooo now look at this next one."" Not in depth at all.",1407456000,,128,3.7777777777777777
3920670,3,B002EZLO04,"I played this through a couple of times and then gave it to my neighbor. It has great photography, The narrative is weak--Also I am surprised that the other reviewers forgot to mention that this one ( Water Life)
DOESN'T LOOP-- that's right if you are running a virtual Aquarium this is great if you want to reset it after every loop. To bad because other than that it isn't all that bad. FYI the cost of running my TV and Blue ray DVD player 24 hours a day is about a buck a month but runs higher (about $2.00) when I turn them off at night and then back on in the morning. Mine has been running continually now for 3 years. I I think that when the 40"" Flat screen and the DVD player die that they will be so cheap at that time that they will give me one. Or at 68 years old I just might outlive the one that I have.",1405900800,3,817,3.927710843373494
3920671,3,B002EZLO04,"This review is for the Blu-ray version.

First of all, the photography rates five stars but I doubt I'll watch this again.

The narration is a waste. I'd say it was at a grade school level if it wasn't for some of the vocabulary. You're informed that sea urchins move on their ambulacral feet for example. The narration is sparse and doesn't explain much. Also the wording is odd. For example. I learned that rocky coastlines are ""battlefields plagued by beings"" and that ""barnacles shake their legs to catch suspended matter."" Narration usually uses the word beings instead of animals.

The credits are all in Spanish. The original narration was probably in Spanish too. A poor translation would explain the often odd phrasing. It doesn't explain the lack of content.",1294272000,7,768,4.892307692307693
3920672,1,B002EZLO04,"There is nothing redeeming about this documentary.  Stick with Home, the Equator series, or something from the BBC.",1270512000,,115,5.388888888888889
3920673,4,B002EZLO04,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Water-Life/dp/B002EZLO18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Water Life</a>&nbsp;is a very good documentary and probably the best I've seen in a long time that wasn't produced by the BBC. Visually, this documentary is stunning (especially in blu-ray). It covers aquatic environments on land and in water, showcasing the diversity and range of ecosystems.

This isn't simply another version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Planet-Seas-of-Life/dp/B001957A4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Planet: Seas of Life</a>. In fact,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Water-Life/dp/B002EZLO18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Water Life</a>&nbsp;features relatively few of the large, charismatic aquatic animals such as whales and sharks (although they are in the documentary). Rather, this series spends a good deal of time with the smaller creatures. It does this well, with great closeups of insects and baby fish. Many of these animals, while not new to science, are certainly new to TV viewers. In fact, it's almost more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microcosmos/dp/B0000DZ3BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microcosmos</a>&nbsp;in that sense.

Unfortunately, the narrator doesn't match the quality of the footage. The narrator's voice is extremely dry, almost robotic. While the images show awesome scenes of water ripping through valleys, the narrator comes across as pedantic in tone. It's too bad David Attenborough couldn't narrate it. Perhaps the narration could be remixed for a new version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Water-Life/dp/B002EZLO18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Water Life</a>.",1259625600,7,1830,8.237373737373737
