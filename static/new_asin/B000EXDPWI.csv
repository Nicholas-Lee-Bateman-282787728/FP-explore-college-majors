8115264,1,B000EXDPWI,"""The cover for ""Penguins' Walk"" is false advertising.  There are no Emperor Penguins on this video and no penguins in the wild.  Instead, someone went to the zoo with a camcorder and filmed some captive Humboldt Penguins.

Do not buy this video.  You will be disappointed.",1394409600,,272,4.8478260869565215
