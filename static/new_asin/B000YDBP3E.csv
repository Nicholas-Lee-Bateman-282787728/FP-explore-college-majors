3025809,4,B000YDBP3E,"Large sinkholes begin opening up in the streets of Tokyo. Out of them emerge horrifying monsters who begin slaughtering people for no apparent reason.  Bullets don't harm them.  Nothing does.  That is, until the off-the-records special division of the police force known as Tokko arrives to hack the beasts -known as ""phantoms""- to bits with their swords. Coolness ensues.  ""Tokko"" is a first-rate action series that isn't given time to build the first-rate story that would have made it the classic it could have been.  It's got killer action with more than a little blood and gore, some horror visuals, great characters, solid art and animation, and a very good story.  It just needed more room to grow.

The hero of the story is Ranmaru Shindo, a young police officer who lives with his younger sister (incest jokes incoming!) who is also a cop.  The two were orphaned in what is know as the Machida Massacre, a random (or was it?) attack by the phantoms that left a lot of children with no parents 5 years ago.  Ranmaru meets the woman of his dreams (quite literally) when he encounters Tokko doing their thing during his duties one day.  Every anime needs a hot girl named Sakura, and this one is no exception.  The pink-haired supernatural warrior is accompanied by the sexually-outgoing blonde Kureha -who takes quite a liking to Ranmaru, the groups' stoic male, Takeru Inukai, and the bespectacled beauty heading the operation, Ryoko Ibuki.  each character has their own backstory and each has more in common then we are led to believe.  Turns out that what allows Tokko to battle the phantoms is their symbiotic physical partnership with rebel phantoms, who merge in them and grant them b!+chin' powers and sweet tats (not a misspelling; the Tokko girls' hotness is presumably natural) to boot.  As the plot unfolds the past is explored, the other side gets to say their piece, the goals of the phantoms are revealed, and so are the eventual fates of our heroes.  The price if they fail: Hell on Earth and the extinction of mankind.  No pressure, though.

""Tokko"" drips with style.  The writing is great, the story is engrossing, and who doesn't love a girl who showers with her weapons so she can kick demonic tail in the nude if necessary?  Hyper-kinetic fight scenes with lots of severed limbs never hurt, and sexual tension between multiple characters works well here.  Ranmaru's perpetually-angry superior officer is a hoot as well.  Everywhere you look in this show, there is something cool, be it a cool concept, a brutal and revealing flashback, a plot twist, or just a really ugly monster.  A win all around.

It's a nice 13 episode package, but not much time to get through a pretty epic storyline.  A second season is hinted at and Lord knows there is plenty of room left for more, but it has not materialized.  That's a shame because considering what ""Tokko"" does in 13 episodes, 26 could have put it over the top into 5 star territory.  The English dub is well above average, the gore and nudity put this out of the kid-friendly zone, and the action and outstanding characters make this something that any adult anime fan can enjoy. The ending is predictably rushed and vague, but other than that, there is very little to complain about.  This boxed set is a hell of a bargain.

3025812,5,B000YDBP3E,"From the imaginative mind of Tori Fujisawa comes Tokko to TV sets around the world.

Tokko takes viewers into the world of Shindou Ranmaru, a newly minted investigator from the Police Academy with a disturbing fantasy world.  If it's not his prancing in her lingerie sister, the half naked dream girl, or the wave of mass murders that invades his dream life, he is one mal adjusted cop.  As a young man, his family and an entire apartment complex was murdered in Machida, leaving one other witness.  Haunting his dreams, the half-naked girl (Rokujo Sakura) turns up at head quarters as part of Tokko, the secret division of Tokki.  Unlike regular cops, their weapons are swords with no mercy.  Transferring his dream life to reality, he forges a friendship with her and begins to understand the forces that terminated thousands of people in Machida.

Tokko focuses on the appearance of mysterious bottomless holes that lead to murders and `possessions' that turn the victims into zombies that threated the whole city.  That's where Tokko comes in.  Their function is to battle the invaders from beneath, no matter what the cost.

I must say, Tokko is a fascinating look at the life of Shindou and the forces that pursue him during his life.  `Awakening' is a first class episode that draws you into the next, and the next, and so on.  Packed with adventure, interesting characters from the slacker rookies, the beautiful Rokujo Sakura, the explosive head of division one, Kurkida, his volupterous sister, and the Elite division, the Tokki.  It is addicting, with 22 minute segments designed to run into one another as one continious production.  Perhaps that is next.

Tokko is classy, from art to script.  It has the mysterious, `buy me, watch me' factor that so many productions lack.  Congratulations Manga.com, you have a winner.

Look for Tokko at your local video dealer, comic book store, or online at [...]

3025813,4,B000YDBP3E,"Monsters, blood, swords and the potential destruction of the world. Good stuff!

It's also most of what ""Tokko"" is made up with, along with a generous amount of totally gratuitous cleavage. It's fairly funny, very violent, pretty well-written and its solidly suspenseful storyline is only marred by an ending that... isn't. Almost is, but isn't.

Five years ago, a hole appeared in front of a Machida apartment complex. Savage demonic creatures emerged and slaughtered almost everyone in the building.

Ranmaru Shindo is on his first day's duty as a cop, when his team is attacked by zombies controlled by demon larvae. They're only saved by the intervention of sword-wielding cops from the mysterious division, TOKKO. One of them is a childhood friend of Ranmaru's, Sakura, who has been haunting his dreams recently.

He becomes convinced that the zombies and TOKKO are connected to the Machida massacre... and the strange tattoo that's appeared on his arm. Of course, he's right -- turns out demons are flooding into our world courtesy of a shattered alchemist's box. But thanks to demon symbiotes -- like the one on Ranmaru's arm -- TOKKO is able to fight and kill them.

So naturally Ranmaru is transferred into TOKKO, and he turns out to be stronger and more skilled than anyone suspected. But his investigations into the alchemist box and the Machida massacre become more dangerous when a sinister old man becomes involved -- and Ranmaru faces losing more than his soul.

The first half of ""Tokko"" is a sort of detective story wrapped in supernatural trappings, but the second half is when things really heat up. Basically, the whole world will be devoured by demons unless our heroes stop them... except they have demons in their own bodies. What a mess.

But it's a fun mess -- lots of creepy cliffhangers, spraying gore, dismembered bodies, zombies, monstrously carnivorous demons, swords, and (for the boys) utterly gratuitous boobery. And once Ranmaru settles into Tokko, things start getting even more violent than before. Basically that's the core of the series, along with the detective work.

But it has some solid atmosphere as well, especially in the second half -- Sakura fighting the ""evil Ranmaru,"" the horrific climactic battle, and walls crawling with demons. And it has some funny dialogue, usually from Kunikida (""I was told you were hooked on a respirator in ICU, stoned out of your skull on a morphine drip, and ****ing the bed from your internal injuries!"" ""I have a really good doctor...?"").

So what's the problem? Well, there's only half an ending. The immediate storyline is nicely wrapped up in the last episode, but there are still some flapping threads. And the last few seconds drag the plot right back out. It's pretty clear they intended to continue the anime, but sadly that didn't happen.

Ranmaru is a pretty typical action-anime hero -- he's sort of boyish and cute, but can be a brutal fighter when the story demands. Sakura is a bit too mysterious to be an engaging love interest, but Kureha, Ryoko and the kooky Saya all are interesting. And Kunikida is a pretty hilarious character -- a foul-mouthed, womanizing, tough-as-nails police chief who says everything in a dull roar.

""Tokko"" is all blood, skin and swords, with lots of action and an interesting detective story. Just don't expect much closure at the finale.",1195344000,22,3363,4.9661921708185055

3025818,3,B000YDBP3E,Nice show but it left me wanting more from the series. I was wondering if they ever made a second season or did they just make a manga?,1364342400,,135,3.857142857142857
3025819,4,B000YDBP3E,"The story could be developed more, but for what it is, you still grow pretty attached to the characters and it's very fun to watch.",1361145600,,131,4.28
3025820,5,B000YDBP3E,The Best Anime Ever because it has alot of violence yet has one of the best story plots ever plus if you like violence this is the Anime you want to watch.,1359590400,,155,3.875
3025821,3,B000YDBP3E,"Over all a good anime. I give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. This is because the story line is really linear. The main character rushes blindly into situations he doesn't understand, and people are always unwilling to talk about whats going on. Its meant to be secretive, but it just ends up getting a little annoying.

On the bright side, there is good amount of action, gore and swordplay. The character development is awesome. The Chief is an awesome character.

I really just loved the swords. The way they were shown with the sword crossing half the screen. Kind like a line you don't want to cross. Always good.

The weak story spoils it though unfortunately.",1353628800,,657,4.504201680672269

3025823,1,B000YDBP3E,"Ok, I saw the first few episodes on TV and I thought they were relatively entertaining so I decided to buy the whole serious. That was a mistake. The series starts off alright as a sort of supernatural detective mystery story. Then basically attempts to become a ""horror"" story. It doesn't succeed. The animation seems like the artists got sloppy or they didn't have a large enough budget, but i could have lived with that. What really made me mad about this series was the freaking ending! Its like they got tired of doing the story and they just stopped. It ends so suddenly right in the middle of a climactic battle seen and that's it. It tries to add a little more on and make it seem like there is going to be second season but there is no second season. I also came to find out that is the way the manga ended also. The artist just stopped the series and never finished it. I have no idea why someone would decide to make an anime out of an incomplete story. It doesn't make any sense.  Anyways if you're looking for a good anime with good animation and a good story i wouldn't recommend this one. Tokko will leave you sorely disappointed.",1312761600,5,1145,4.350467289719626
3025824,1,B000YDBP3E,"That's it, I've had it. I've seen so many of these anime shows where either they ran out of budget, tried to cram a complete series of manga's into half the episodes, or just really lazy ""wrap it up"" story telling. I just want to make a note to all the animators out there. If you can't make a complete well thought out anime DON'T EVEN BOTHER! It's a waste of my time.

If you can't tell Tokko happens to be one such Animie. ""The Complete Series""? ""COMPLETE!?!"" this is the laziest animation I've ever seen. For 7 episodes nothing really happens matter of fact I was plain out bored. Then finally the last 6 become interesting and it just ends abruptly in the middle of a climatic battle. Don't get me wrong, this is far from ""BERSERK"". Although I hated that ending we at least got fulfilling episodes. The ending really just a way to push you into the manga where the story continued.

However Tokko, jeez! What's the point of this series? It's too short, the first episodes are too long and drawn out,and when it gets to the point when it starts to become interesting it just ends. Normally this is the type of anime that needs 24 or 48(2 seasons)episodes to fully play the story out. At best this is forgettable and trust me it will be forgotten there's nothing about it that really stands out aside from the girl who doesn't wear a bra and the ending that ticked me off.  People watch anime for the entertainment value and especially the story. What's the point of watching something that just ends right in the middle?

Imagine watching Starwars and as soon as Luke meets Darth Vader for the final battle they cut to a shot of the Deathstar exploding and roll the credits. That's this freaking anime! Why even bother making this? There's no point! Nothing happens to hold your interest and I could careless if there's a manga available for this. The story wasn't good enough for anyone to consider wasting their time to find a manga and try to read it just to figure out if Tokko is decent or not.

1 Deathstar for this crap! I'm putting my foot down. Good concept terrible execution. This anime should never have been made. Completely pointless!",1308614400,6,2152,4.493606138107417
3025825,4,B000YDBP3E,"Not a spoiler, it's in the first episode... the main character and his sister have a very very strange relationship. It was difficult for me to watch without being embarrassed... The way it ended required a second installment. It did not come. This made me sad. Demons, portal to hell, detectives and cute naked chicks... Worth the purchase.",1304985600,,341,4.896551724137931
3025826,3,B000YDBP3E,"This wasn't a great show, but it was good and Ill wactch it again. Tokko had everything I want in an anime. The one thing I HATE about tokko is the end of it! It just ends....",1304467200,,175,3.7567567567567566
3025827,3,B000YDBP3E,"I'm not sure I can recommend this.  There is a lot that is very accomplished about this set. The animation is expertly done, the voices are well performed, the story is interesting, but..., there are some problems. It attempts to be ""frightening"" and ultimately doesn't do very well there. The characters ""try"" to be endearing, but you don't end up caring very much about any of them. And the set ends with a story that makes no clear revelation as to what happened to bring it to an end.  There's a climactic battle between good and evil, and no clear understanding of who won, and never any real answers in the story as to why the things that happen are happening. I did not find the ""monsters"" to be very impressive.  Sort of mundane looking and uninteresting. A lot of blood is shed, but it doesn't seem very realistic. This set of episodes was interesting enough to hold my attention through to the end, but I will not watch it again.  I don't think it's entertaining enough to be re-watchable.

3025828,5,B000YDBP3E,"I had to order the rest of the series after watching only 2 episodes on the Sci-Fi channels ani-Mondays. I'm glad I did, I love the story and characters! Its not ground breaking anime by any means but it still ranks high. The story is well written and so interesting it pulls you in as well as do the characters. I love anime with a sci-fi kinda plot and this is just that. It starts when all but a few of the people that live in an apartment complex are brutally murdered,the few survivors slowly come together through the aid of a police women and discover how and why they survived. They also learn of powers each one possess allowing them to destroy the phantoms, we later find out their called that killed their friends and families. Inside these phantoms are puzzle pieces they need to collect  before the world is taken over(a little dramatic but it works!)and soon discover  there's a small problem, each one of them have a piece of the puzzle inside themselves so in order save the world they have to sacrifice their own lives!
  The only complaint is that I don't know if their going to make any more series. I heard talk that the producers are trying to convince the creator of the series to write again but she(I think its a she?)is currently working on new projects. There's so much more to the story that was left unanswered then answered which we all know happens a lot in anime but I don't think its right to leave fans hanging. If you buy it and like it we can only hope for future series! enjoy",1256169600,4,1512,4.370106761565836
3025829,3,B000YDBP3E,"Paranormal detectives, people running around with huge swords, demons threatening to destroy tokyo, does any of this sound familiar? To me this anime is just like any of the other 3 bajillion animes out there with the exact same format and Tokko is not much different. Although there is some good action scenes, a somewhat interesting storyline, and a fair amount of anime boobies, I just couldn't get over the feeling that ive seen this before. Not to mention the ending left me sayying ""WTF!? Is that it??"" If ur looking for your everyday generic hack and slash demon hunter anime then this is it.

""I have a really good doctor...?"").

So what's the problem? Well, there's only half an ending. The immediate storyline is nicely wrapped up in the last episode, but there are still some flapping threads. And the last few seconds drag the plot right back out. It's pretty clear they intended to continue the anime, but sadly that didn't happen.

Ranmaru is a pretty typical action-anime hero -- he's sort of boyish and cute, but can be a brutal fighter when the story demands. Sakura is a bit too mysterious to be an engaging love interest, but Kureha, Ryoko and the kooky Saya all are interesting. And Kunikida is a pretty hilarious character -- a foul-mouthed, womanizing, tough-as-nails police chief who says everything in a dull roar.

""Tokko"" is all blood, skin and swords, with lots of action and an interesting detective story. Just don't expect much closure at the finale.",1195344000,22,3363,4.9661921708185055

3260318,3,B000YDBP3E,"Over all a good anime. I give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. This is because the story line is really linear. The main character rushes blindly into situations he doesn't understand, and people are always unwilling to talk about whats going on. Its meant to be secretive, but it just ends up getting a little annoying.

On the bright side, there is good amount of action, gore and swordplay. The character development is awesome. The Chief is an awesome character.

I really just loved the swords. The way they were shown with the sword crossing half the screen. Kind like a line you don't want to cross. Always good.

3260320,1,B000YDBP3E,"Ok, I saw the first few episodes on TV and I thought they were relatively entertaining so I decided to buy the whole serious. That was a mistake. The series starts off alright as a sort of supernatural detective mystery story. Then basically attempts to become a ""horror"" story. It doesn't succeed. The animation seems like the artists got sloppy or they didn't have a large enough budget, but i could have lived with that. What really made me mad about this series was the freaking ending! Its like they got tired of doing the story and they just stopped. It ends so suddenly right in the middle of a climactic battle seen and that's it. It tries to add a little more on and make it seem like there is going to be second season but there is no second season. I also came to find out that is the way the manga ended also. The artist just stopped the series and never finished it. I have no idea why someone would decide to make an anime out of an incomplete story. It doesn't make any sense.  Anyways if you're looking for a good anime with good animation and a good story i wouldn't recommend this one. Tokko will leave you sorely disappointed.",1312761600,5,1145,4.350467289719626
3260321,1,B000YDBP3E,"That's it, I've had it. I've seen so many of these anime shows where either they ran out of budget, tried to cram a complete series of manga's into half the episodes, or just really lazy ""wrap it up"" story telling. I just want to make a note to all the animators out there. If you can't make a complete well thought out anime DON'T EVEN BOTHER! It's a waste of my time.

If you can't tell Tokko happens to be one such Animie. ""The Complete Series""? ""COMPLETE!?!"" this is the laziest animation I've ever seen. For 7 episodes nothing really happens matter of fact I was plain out bored. Then finally the last 6 become interesting and it just ends abruptly in the middle of a climatic battle. Don't get me wrong, this is far from ""BERSERK"". Although I hated that ending we at least got fulfilling episodes. The ending really just a way to push you into the manga where the story continued.

However Tokko, jeez! What's the point of this series? It's too short, the first episodes are too long and drawn out,and when it gets to the point when it starts to become interesting it just ends. Normally this is the type of anime that needs 24 or 48(2 seasons)episodes to fully play the story out. At best this is forgettable and trust me it will be forgotten there's nothing about it that really stands out aside from the girl who doesn't wear a bra and the ending that ticked me off.  People watch anime for the entertainment value and especially the story. What's the point of watching something that just ends right in the middle?

Imagine watching Starwars and as soon as Luke meets Darth Vader for the final battle they cut to a shot of the Deathstar exploding and roll the credits. That's this freaking anime! Why even bother making this? There's no point! Nothing happens to hold your interest and I could careless if there's a manga available for this. The story wasn't good enough for anyone to consider wasting their time to find a manga and try to read it just to figure out if Tokko is decent or not.

1 Deathstar for this crap! I'm putting my foot down. Good concept terrible execution. This anime should never have been made. Completely pointless!",1308614400,6,2152,4.493606138107417

3260324,3,B000YDBP3E,"I'm not sure I can recommend this.  There is a lot that is very accomplished about this set. The animation is expertly done, the voices are well performed, the story is interesting, but..., there are some problems. It attempts to be ""frightening"" and ultimately doesn't do very well there. The characters ""try"" to be endearing, but you don't end up caring very much about any of them. And the set ends with a story that makes no clear revelation as to what happened to bring it to an end.  There's a climactic battle between good and evil, and no clear understanding of who won, and never any real answers in the story as to why the things that happen are happening. I did not find the ""monsters"" to be very impressive.  Sort of mundane looking and uninteresting. A lot of blood is shed, but it doesn't seem very realistic. This set of episodes was interesting enough to hold my attention through to the end, but I will not watch it again.  I don't think it's entertaining enough to be re-watchable.

3260325,5,B000YDBP3E,"I had to order the rest of the series after watching only 2 episodes on the Sci-Fi channels ani-Mondays. I'm glad I did, I love the story and characters! Its not ground breaking anime by any means but it still ranks high. The story is well written and so interesting it pulls you in as well as do the characters. I love anime with a sci-fi kinda plot and this is just that. It starts when all but a few of the people that live in an apartment complex are brutally murdered,the few survivors slowly come together through the aid of a police women and discover how and why they survived. They also learn of powers each one possess allowing them to destroy the phantoms, we later find out their called that killed their friends and families. Inside these phantoms are puzzle pieces they need to collect  before the world is taken over(a little dramatic but it works!)and soon discover  there's a small problem, each one of them have a piece of the puzzle inside themselves so in order save the world they have to sacrifice their own lives!
  The only complaint is that I don't know if their going to make any more series. I heard talk that the producers are trying to convince the creator of the series to write again but she(I think its a she?)is currently working on new projects. There's so much more to the story that was left unanswered then answered which we all know happens a lot in anime but I don't think its right to leave fans hanging.

8231866,2,B000YDBP3E,"Five years earlier, Ranmaru Shindo and his sister Saya survived a very brutal attack that claimed the lives of over 300 people in their apartment complex with their parents among those lost. He has chosen to become a police officer working for one of their divisions with hopes of finding his parents killers. For some reason, there's a connection between that tragedy and a young girl with a sword he sees in his dreams. What does this girl have to do with this event and monsters he claims to see? -summary

Based on the manga of the same name which was written by Tohru Fujisawa and directed by Masashi Abe. Tokko is an action anime that dabbles in the supernatural and Japanese mysticism. It involves a group of supernatural detectives taking on supernatural threats, in this case it's some type of zombie like creatures possessed by demons whom devour the living. Many naysayers hit on the unoriginal feel of the series, yet I can outright ignore just how derivative the story is, because the real problems are stale characters, unnecessary filler, bad story progression, poor interactions, plus a rushed and unfinished ending. This is more than enough to bury any title 40,000 leagues under the sea.

 I honestly do not watch anime for the sake of complaining but there is so much about Tokko to complain about. The characters are a real problem beginning at the top. The main character Ranmaru and his sister Saya have a relationship that can only be described as disturbingly creepy, while the rest are bland stereotypes meant to fill up roles. There's only one character by the name of Chief Kunikida who is funny as hell (English dub), and I doubt he was meant to be the real comedy relief.

 The plot follows Ranmaru as he becomes intrigued by these monsters they face and he eventually meets the girl in his dreams, the sword wielding Sakura, and her team equipped to deal with this threat called Tokko. It appears that they are the only one's capable of killing these monsters. He learns a lot about them, plus the main threat which has a whole lot to do with him and the tragedy they all experienced that changed their lives.

 Tokko drags its feet revealing smaller parts to the mystery, and the pacing is bad as it jams in more moments of Saya and the weak cast. I found no one in this worth attaching too. Ranmaru is the typical shonen guy that acts as if he's afraid of women, gets in danger, all that good stuff. The characters are so weak and can't carry the plot leaving only its story to try and save things which had plenty of potential. There's another organization to battle the creatures, other warriors of Tokko's type with one couple actually doing something weird to the monsters after they kill them. Unfortunately, a lot of this stuff goes nowhere and it's even more frustrating that the episodes contain more filler than substance. It also does a terrible job at foreshadowing; it's too obvious what's going to happen and who could be working something behind the scenes.

 Even the production values are quite mixed; the action department consists of the quick swipes and falling body parts which gets old really quick, yet there are some nice moments of some brutal gore. The bullet holes to the face and eyes looks pretty cool, with monsters being outright obliterated into pieces along with blades through the head. It's a shame that the viewer isn't treated to a lot more of that.

 The backgrounds of buildings, trees, and hazy flashbacks make good use of the visuals, yet still character backgrounds and CG background vehicles look awkward. I'll give credit to the creepy monster designs though; those baby-face looking, parasitic maggots, are something that will stick with you. Whenever I think of this anime those sick looking things come to mind. They are definitely the highlight in terms of designs. The J-pop soundtrack is just there, but the series BGM does have its moments where it tries to work with its horror-like atmosphere using static background music which works well in the hazy, choppy like flashbacks and visions.

 In the end though, Tokko crumbles underneath everything it wants to do. I saw a professional review once stating that this anime is an unrelenting blood bath, and it's one of the most violent series ever created. Do not buy into this; the violence is pretty average when considering how violent this genre has been for awhile. In addition, it spins its wheels with not much happening until around half way, plus the ending is a serious jip. The only people I can see falling for this are the very easy to please. If you do not fall into that group then I recommend other dark action titles such as Speed Grapher, Basilisk, or Berserk. I agree that Berserk has a jury-rigged ending, but at least everything before the ending is very gripping and leaves a damn good impression. Tokko is simply boring and forgettable.

 Highs: Decent production values

 Lows: Lots of missed potential, undeveloped story elements, unfinished",1451520000,,4997,4.778422273781903
