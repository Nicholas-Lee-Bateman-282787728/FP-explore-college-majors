This documentary is the first I have encountered that reveals how many of the psychedelic and psychoactive plants and fungi we know of today were first discovered and introduced to western culture. As someone who participated in the psychedelic culture of the '60's and who holds a deep respect for the transformative and healing power of these sacraments and substances, I am particularly grateful to know the deeper story of their discovery, the cultural contexts within which they were discovered, and their eventual emergence into our own world and culture. I have watched and re-watched this video and have purchased several copies as gifts for friends and relatives. It is unique in its coverage of this fascinating subject. Highly recommended!",1390176000,2,856,4.993006993006993

8394654,5,B003D3Y6D8,"Despite its sensationalistic title and made for History Channel origins, this is actually a wonderful documentary that chronicles the life of Richard Evans Schultes through the narration of his student and biographer Wade Davis. The biographical components are interspersed with interviews with (or historical context on) other well known names in the world of ethnobotany and the psychedelic/beat era, also closely associated with Schultes, such as Andrew Weil, W.S. Borroughs, and Timothy Leary.

Davis follows firsthand in Schultes footsteps throughout the video, from his early work with peyote to the discovery of ""magic"" mushrooms to his later involvement with rubber exploration for the US military. It's a great reminder how ahead of his time Schultes was, as an ethnobotanist, explorer, and professor. I've used this video in my classroom now for 3 years.  After you see it, read One River.",1327276800,9,899,5.414285714285715
