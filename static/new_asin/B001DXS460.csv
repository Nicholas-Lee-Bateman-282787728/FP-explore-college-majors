8295342,5,B001DXS460,I bought this DVD in hopes to see more of the modern mummy project and I was disappointed. It has less of that than my bonus material dvd has. It does however show a few extra tidbits of that project but not enough. I have seen the little girl mummy that they explore in person and I was speechless to watch the footage of C-arm exploration of her. That is the most amazing part of the DVD. It is a pretty good DVD and I would buy again but I can't say that I got all that I hoped for.,1368230400,,485,3.86
8295343,5,B001DXS460,"I used this DVD as a preview to a museum's exhibit (Mummies of the World) and it exceeded all my expectations.  The background to mummification, especially the doctor who used the same processes to mummify a corpse was incredible!  The students were better able to understand the museum exhibit after seeing this DVD!  Excellent!",1354320000,,329,5.055555555555555
8295344,3,B001DXS460,"I associate ""technology"" with the modern and mummies are practically the ultimate items of the ancient.  However, much of this show focuses upon how cat scans are revealing things about mummies that modern humans didn't know before.

This work mentioned much that I already knew on the subject.  For example, that the brain was taken out of the nose, that certain body parts were put in jars, etc.  They mention that Egyptians thought the heart was the organ for thinking.  Not to diss, but since people who face cranium damage often are no longer as smart as they were, I found that a bit surprising.

For part of this work, they speak about pyramids and I think veered from the mummy main subject.  They stress King Tut, of course.

I think of work in the early 1900s when I think of mummies.  However, I applaud the program for focusing on what was done in the 1800s.  They provide a critical lens on colonial people of the time.  They say people would rip mummy clothing off and keep the artefacts found in a parlor game.  They give this a positive spin by reciting that Ramses I was found among these mummies in Upstate NY.

I get the sense tht ""Modern Marvels"" likes to end on a positive note.  The last segments are about techniques being used so that pulled mummies don't decay.  I wonder if some of these lessons or concerns could be placed upon the Titanic, which is supposedly disappearing due to interest from the living.

On a final quicky note, I am a Chicagoan and they interview some experts from our Field Museum.  I don't usually think of my town as being a center for the study or preservation of Ancient Egypt, but perhaps I should.",1324339200,,1652,4.508417508417509
