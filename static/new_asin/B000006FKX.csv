1194322,1,B000006FKX,"I have seen a read a lot of plays.  I have never understood the attraction of ""Virginia Woolf"".  Albee is not my favorite author to begin with.  The 50's through the 70's seemed to have spawned a lot of plays that worked really hard to be artsy and have a message without being at all entertaining.  Maybe with different character interpretation that allows you to be more sympathetic to the protagonist.  Maybe giving the characters a little more depth rather than making them stereotypes.  I have only seen this one version of ""Virginia Woolf"" and was so turned off by it, I never saw the play done, although I read it several years ago.  There is also no comic relief from all the sturm und  drang, which would have been quite welcome.  There is no looking at our character faults with a degree of wry amusement, just poisonous vitriol and mockery. Yuck.",1516579200,,857,4.5855263157894735

1194326,5,B000006FKX,"This is one of my favorite films.  Not so much for the storyline- nothing really happens (though they do try).  But for the visuals and the nuanced jabs between Martha and George (Taylor and Burton).  It was shot by Haskell Wexler.  Great detail was put into the interior of George and Marthas home.  I read somewhere that hundreds of little mini spots were used to light the place just so.  In this respect, the film definitely benefits from HD.  Even in the dialogue, you see more detail in the faces and clothing.  I do prefer the contrast and audio track of the DVD, but it may very well have been transcoded from the same file as the blu-ray.  I may just be seeing and hearing more noise than on the DVD simply because there is more detail to show.  If you love this film and have owned the DVD for years, I would recommend the upgrade.

1194330,4,B000006FKX,"Review of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
Hot Toasty Rag, July 20, 2017

In 2010, Elizabeth Taylor famously told Us Weekly, Im still heartbroken that Richard [Burton] never won an Oscar. Its tragic and beyond baffling that Reese Witherspoon and Casey Affleck are Oscar winners, but incredible actors like Richard Burton and Peter OToole never won one.

In Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, real-life spouses Liz and Dick play a hateful, argumentative married couple who take a younger married couple in for the evening. The four have drinks, go out for bowling, and return to the house to keep drinking, but its far from a pleasant dinner party. From the get-go, the main couple is at each others throats, yelling, threatening, and hurling hurtful quips at lightning speed. While Liz won an Oscar in 1967, her partner obviously didnt. Richard Burtons performance was the performance of a lifetime, and it was one of the greatest tragedies of Oscar history. While Taylor shouted and shocked audiences with her dumpy appearance, Burton seethed and stifled, giving a multi-layered performance that many people might not even be able to appreciate.

The film is painful and upsetting, but thats to be expected since its an adaptation of a very heavy play, but its worth it to see Richard Burtons performance. Obviously, if you're a Liz Taylor fan, you're going to want to watch this one, but its her husband who shines. It takes a very sensitive woman to announce, after winning an award, that her heart is broken because her co-star didn't win one. Watch the movie, and youll understand the great heart of Elizabeth Taylor.",1500508800,,1618,4.9411764705882355
1194331,5,B000006FKX,"Powerful, disturbing, intriguing, sad, and strange. I enjoyed it and had to wonder, how much of that was actual ""acting""?",1499385600,,121,5.1
1194342,4,B000006FKX,"Was George the writer creating the whole situation?  Why should someone fear Virginia Woolf?  Because a writer has absolute power over characters?  In the end, did George create the death of their son, a son who may have been just fiction?  A writer adding a chapter to a book? Why Woolf, though?  Consider a novel like ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  Why would someone be afraid of that novel?  Or why would someone think it ridiculous to be afraid of Woolf ?  Why did the academics at the party think the song was so funny?  The point of the joke seems to be that Virginia Woolf is dense verbiage, and that the academics see her as the wicked witch for testing their limits.  Or  ""Virginia Woolf"" is  code for the artificial construct that is college in the sense that (per Albee) no one would read her books outside of a college homework assignment.  But Woolf is actually a great writer, and her work does resonate.",1499299200,,905,4.512345679012346

1194344,5,B000006FKX,"Based on Edward Albee's scathing play, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" is a movie that was way before its time.  Explicit language (for its time), sexual innuendo, and sexual situations purvey at an after-party get together between a boozed and beleaguered college professor and his wife (expertly portrayed by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) and their ""guests"", also expertly portrayed by George Segal and Sandy Dennis.  Before the night is through, NO ONE will be spared.

Winner of the Oscar for Best Actress (Taylor) and Best Actress (Sandy Dennis), I cannot say enough about ""Virginia Woolf.""  The end scene between Burton and Taylor to this day still leaves me in tears.  This is what acting is all about.  To her dying day, Elizabeth Taylor said her favorite role was Martha (from this play).  This was first-time director Mike Nichols' debut.  It was rumored Warner Brothers wanted Bette Davis and James Mason for the lead roles.  I'm glad Nichols got his way.  George Segal and Sandy Dennis were exceptional as Nick and Honey, a couple well on their way of becoming the next George and Martha. Richard Burton was simply robbed by the Academy when he lost for Best Actor.

Although this film is not rated, it contains adult language and adult situations.  It is also my pick as the best movie ever made.",1498780800,,1317,4.856502242152466

1194369,5,B000006FKX,"There could never have been a more perfect pairing of actors to portray Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) and her husband George (Richard Burton).
Sandy Dennis and George Segal are equally suited to their respective rolls as Honey and Nick.

Their portrayal of a marriage gone down the proverbial tubes is the standard by which all other productions, whether they be cinematic or staged must be judged.
They convey an atmosphere of feral toxicity that is so lethally visceral, the viewer might consider taking whatever precautions necessary, prior to watching the movie, to avoid being drawn into the fray on their own level of psychological susceptibility.

The dialogue is filled with a torrential onslaught of lethal witticisms that would cut through cement with blood chilling precision.
The movie presents a debatable premise within the context of a distraught marriage, that life is easier with him or her than without; although this is a matter of opinion that is highly subjective.

This movie is a mirror of the most grotesque realities of the human condition that requires an appreciable measure of intestinal fortitude to face these uncomfortable truths. If you watch this film just for the pleasure of watching two people annihilating each other, that's fine too, but there are better films for satisfying that level of superficial entertainment.

While there are no threats of physical abuse, the magnitude of intellectual sparring and emotional manipulation as an overt form of provocation are portrayed with a degree of realistic intensity that is seldom revealed in the presence of strangers and usually confined to the most private sanctums behind closed doors.

Speaking of hanging the dirty laundry in the presence of strangers, we must not forget Honey and Nick; a young couple who are too easily overlooked and perceived as innocent bystanders.

Nick is a rising star at the same university where George also teaches, and Honey who is perceived as an innocent, reveals her carefully concealed insecurity and lowers her guard when plied with alcohol.
The implication is that they are possibly a younger George and  Martha with the potential to fall into the same trap of marital and professional dissatisfaction which might ensure a self fulfilling prophesy.

The direction Mike Nichols is nothing short of another impressive example of his ability to pace this visual hurricane with the skill of a master choreographer.",1489017600,,2432,5.217948717948718

1194387,5,B000006FKX,"This is a great film based on a great play but the relationship between George and Martha doesn't really make any sense. Their emotional abuse of each other is so over the top and exaggerated that it ceases to seem realistic. Their battles are epic! The only way their relationship makes any sense is if you imagine them feeding off the emotional intensity, like two unemployed actors with only their failed marriage for a stage and another couple for their audience. The fantasy child supports this interpretation because he is part of a game of make believe. The abusive relationship is a work of genius, a collaboration between two drama queens more interested in raw emotion than genuine feelings.",1483747200,,701,4.899159663865547

I spent the first 10 mins amazed by how beautiful Elizabeth Taylor was. Completely void of the Hollywood glam, a bit older with a little bit of weight and still stunningly beautiful. That was until she basically disappeared into that vile complex character. Best performance she ever did in my opinion. All the actors were amazing and the chemistry between her and Sir Lawrence Olivier was so intense, it made me wonder was it really acting or just being themselves on script.

1194578,5,B000006FKX,"Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton give off enough sparks to ignite the screen in Mike Nichol's superb adaptation of Edward Albee's legendary and entertainment-altering stagecraft. As a movie, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a minor masterpiece; too wordy for most today, but compelling because the real-life fusing and feuding of the then married Burtons comes very close to the surface of this utterly scathing portrait of domesticity on the rocks. Powerful stuff superbly photographed by Haskell Wexler in stunning B&W. Famously, Albee thought Nichols had miscast the story, going for star power over staying power. He was misinformed and later recognized Nichols had made the right choice - not entirely pleased, but recognizing he could have done a lot worse. Lest we forget, in the Hollywood of old a lot of Albee's incendiary dialogue had to be 'cleaned' up to satisfy the production code. Even so, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? set the screen afire. Today, it holds up remarkably well.

Warner Archive's Blu-ray transfer is first rate - a habit with WB these days and a good one for which fans of vintage Hollywood ought to be thoroughly grateful to receive.

1194582,5,B000006FKX,"Mike Nichols' amazing masterpiece glows anew on Blu-ray. The result: Outstanding! This new Blu-ray release is so meticulously restored, that every brilliant detail of Haskell Wexler's Oscar-winning cinematography is given full advantage here. We now have a new 'demo disc' if you want to see how gorgeous a B&W film can be on Blu-ray. Warner Bros. continues its recent-streak of grand-slam classic releases on the format with this new presentation, with stunning clarity, crispness, and sharpness that makes viewing this disc like seeing the film for the first time.

It is hard to believe that as of this writing, we are coming upon the 50th anniversary of this seminal film, one that helped the contribute to the long-needed end to the ridiculous censorship that plagued American films for decades. The stinging, biting wit of playwright Edward Albee's 1962 play arrived on the big screen virtually intact, thanks to the care of producer Ernest Lehman (who adapted Albee's play as screenwriter, by barely changing a word, and carefully opening up the action a bit from its proscenium-based origins), and director Mike Nichols who burst on to the big screen with one of the most impressive directorial debuts in this history of cinema. It earned 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Elizabeth Taylor (richly deserved), who was not yet 34 years old when she took on the challenge of playing the role of Martha opposite Richard Burton as George. Burton and Taylor are both magnificent here, with his carefully nuanced performance likely being the best he ever was on screen, with time proving he was robbed being overlooked as Best Actor by the Motion Picture Academy, as was the film itself. Look at ""Virginia Woolf"" today vs. the film that did earn the Best Picture Oscar that year (A Man For All Seasons). While non un-impressive the chosen winner seems like a snooze-fest made 25 years earlier, as opposed to this film, with its view on the human condition as timely as ever.

Warner Bros. released a very special DVD edition of this film several years ago, and it looked good for DVD, and came chock full with amazing supplements. The Blu-ray blows the DVD away in every respect in terms of the format's added resolution and better sound quality. Blacks are inky, whites are just perfect, and shadow detail is carefully preserved. The image is more immaculate than it likely was when the first print came off the negative in 1966....it's that perfect. Happily, all the very special features from the DVD are carried over on this new Blu-ray, including 2 great commentaries, one from the late Mr. Wexler, and another one with Director Mike Nichols in conversation with Steven Soderbergh discussing in detail the making of the film, and its legacy. It is riveting to listen to these two talents talk about the film, almost like mentor and student, and it provides a fascinating back-story to understand the context of how difficult it was to make this film, and to have it result in the grand success it was and remains. There are two excellent contemporary 'making-of' pieces, as well as a vintage interview with Nichols being interviewed by Barbara Walters in 1966, screen tests featuring the wonderful Sandy Dennis (who also would win an Oscar for her incredible performance as ""Honey""), and a throng of Burton/Taylor trailers with the ""Virginia Woolf"" trailer thankfully being remastered in HD.  One can't complete a review of this film without also acknowledging the rich and bravura performance of Mr. George Segal (the only surviving cast member as of this writing) as Nick. Like everything else in the film, his work is stellar and couldn't possibly be any better. The ensemble work of the cast under Nichols' direction, is a wonder to behold.

All of this makes for an impeccable release. In a time when the major studios are bailing on releasing new classics on Blu-ray, it is always a thrill to receive a new Warner Blu-ray, as they seem to have now set a gold standard of excellence with every great film they release. I didn't know if anything could top their presentation of ""The Big Sleep"" earlier this year, but now it is ""Virginia Woolf"" that gets my vote for the very best Blu-ray released thus far in the year. Simply stated, it is riveting cinema, beautifully preserved on Blu-ray.",1462579200,,4303,4.906593406593407

I will remark that I gained far more studying the background of the movie, reading the publication, watching it. The performances in this movie are so profound, I get goose bumps thinking about it. It is moving. Look beyond a superficial observation that they simply are fighting. Their love for each other is incredibly moving.

Did Edward Albee know that George and Martha were really saying to the young couple,
""Don't be us.""  And that's why they stayed, to learn who not to be.
Its all teachable, isn't it, Edward?  One way or another.
There are parallels between them, George and Martha's made up child,
the young couple's historical pregnancy, also, not real.  Imagined.
Academic life...not attached to the private sector, elements of the unreal.
Martha's father was not such a big man as she made him out to be, he just knew
how to hang on to power, and isn't that what we all want?
In the context of power, who is really powerful here?
Are you sure that's all you really want?

1194803,4,B000006FKX,"Not many moviegoers remember (or rather maintain the relevance) of Virginia Woolf fifty years later, but when it came out, it was the movie-of-the-year, awarded five Oscars including best actress and best supporting actress.  Burton and Taylor had married only a few years before and were the continual talk (more accurate would be the darlings) of the dramatic profession.  The film debuting director Mike Nichols would go on the next year to create the classic, The Graduate, and then what many consider his masterpiece, Catch-22.  Best of all. it was written by Edward Albee, who was arguably the best (New York) playwright of the times.  The next year he received the Pulitzer prize for A Delicate Balance. and two more in the years after that.
  People went to it because they wanted to see if Taylor and Burton, who obviously loved each other deeply in real life, could master the demands of the aging college faculty couple George and Martha.  We weren't disappointed.  Burton was brilliant at lowering himself to the (verbal) sexual games demanded of him, while Taylor throughout coolly leveled he (justified) screen reputation as a superstar sexpot.  This was Segal's first starring screen role, as he plays off the repartee without tipsy bouncing very nicely.  And it's as though Sandy Dennis was born for her role.  ""Starts out as a shrinking violet and..."", well, never really stops.  Halfway through, the inebriated George stares at the equally drunk Martha in profile close-up and pretty much announces. ""Total war?"" ""Total.""
  This is a movie usually called ""seminal"", due to all the talent involved, which is unfortunate because it's still quite entertaining today.  Back then, people didn't ""attend"" a production of an Albee work.  It was something to be studied (to see who was going to survive, eventually)  And then pondered.",1435276800,,1845,5.076411960132891

1194839,5,B000006FKX,"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a film directed by Mike Nichols. The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is an adaptation of the play of the same title by Edward Albee. It stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton with George Segal and Sandy Dennis. First staged on Broadway in 1962 with Uta Hagen and Arthur Hill, Edward Albee's play was adapted for the screen by Ernest Lehman, who managed to retain virtually all of Albee's scatological epithets.

George is an alcoholic college professor; Martha is his virago of a wife. George and Martha know just how to push each other's buttons, with George having a special advantage: he need only mention the couple's son to send Martha into orbit. This evening, the couple's guests are Nick, a junior professor, and Honey, Nick's child-like wife. After an evening of sadistic ""fun and games,"" the truth about George and Martha's son comes to light.

Keen adaptation and handsome production by Ernest Lehman, outstanding direction by Mike Nichols in his feature debut, and four topflight performances score an artistic bullseye. And in its forthright dealing with the play, this becomes one of the most scathingly honest American films ever made.",1433289600,,1184,5.035714285714286

1194841,5,B000006FKX,"I read the play before I saw the film, and the lines were rendered in a tone that did not coincide with my emotions when reading the play.  The lines are so brilliant and eloquent, but you still need a strong actor to deliver these stealth lines, and Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor invested all the way, such that Elizabeth Taylor looked horrible, ridiculous, and nasty, and Richard Burton was unattractive, pathetic, and mean.

I was riveted.  Like passing a car accident, and you just can't look away.  The characters are so vile to each other, and then you realize that other couples/people/marriages, though sounding stronger, steadier, are also compromises, and hold secrets.

I read Honey's character as a vapid thing with a penchant for brandy while reading the play, but Sandy Dennis went warp speed on the role.  Indeed, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor gave it their all, but neither possessed the gusto that Dennis did, and in every scene she captivated.  She went through the full spectrum of emotions with aplomb, tears and jubilation within a matter of seconds, and she owned every scene.

This is a great film.  All the actors were good, and Edward Albee is a great playwright.  But Sandy Dennis, who won the Academy Award for best actress, delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen onscreen.  It might not be what Edward Albee envisioned as Honey, but Sandy Dennis gives Honey more depth than a young girl, who just tried to trap a man with a faux pregnancy.",1432857600,,1493,4.79296875

The recording was made sans audience, enabling the actors to allow their characters to evolve their own timing, tempo, rhythm and pace. The allostatic impact of the play's preternaturally synchronised incremental and exponential intellectual and emotional drives was transformationally annihilative. Pure Art in all respects.

One of the play's key core concepts was the rapid and relentless entrapment of the audience by the increasingly claustrophobic and inescapable tableau living room set, which was very unfortunately lost in the film. The OBC originators of the characters will forever be unsurpassed both in their ensemble and individual work. Like Krakatoa, this is so very rarely experienced.",1412812800,,922,5.578571428571428

"""""" The Virginia Woolf reference is to the real life Woolf's long and finally tragic battle with depression, ending in suicide. In other words, who's afraid of madness and death as the end to a troubled life? ""I am, George, I am,"" Martha says, in her final moment, accepting the fear and vulnerability that causes her to act out so defensively"""""".`

WARNING AGAIN - """"""""SPOILERS""""""""

""""""FIRST OF ALL, AS MOST OF US KNOW....there actually was an early 19th century female intellectual literary giant named Virginia Woolf, and like Ayn Rand, devoted her life to living without false illusions until she committed suicide in 1941. In her last note to her husband she wrote:

""Dearest, I feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. And I shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don't think two people could have been happier 'til this terrible disease came. I can't fight any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that--everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been. V""

While Virginia Woolf's suicide note may have provide us with some insight into at least an aspect of Virginia Woolf's personal struggles, and how it affected her marriage. However, as difficult as their marriage may have been at times, of course it doesn't necessarily mean that it was anything close to George and Martha's, match made in hell, as depicted in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"".

So, for a little more insight into the characters George and Martha, we now turn our attention toward the original author of the play by Edward Albee who was expelled by a lot of Academies and Universities before continuing his formal education at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was also expelled in 1947. In response to his expulsion, Albee's play 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is believed to be based on his college experiences.

And, the title of his semi-autobiographical play, according to an interview in the Paris Review, Albee said he first found the question ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" scrawled in soap on the bathroom of a New York bar. When he later began writing the play he recalled the ""rather typical, university intellectual joke."" that he had seen written on the bathroom wall in NY ten years earlier. But what does the title mean, and why should I care? Glad you asked.

While we may never know what the person who likes using soap to graffiti NY bathrooms with non-sequiturs involving literary legends who commit suicide meant by the question. However, if you're like me, and have a never ending altruistic pursuit of gaining knowledge through acquiring as much information as you can before you die, no matter how trivial it might be? Then you'll find the answer to the question (what was the question again?) about what the play means, and thus why the movie adaptation that is so admired and celebrated by people who must be closet masochists with severe personality disorders, or something.

The movie is about Illusion vs Reality that asks every audience member, ""Who is afraid of facing reality?"", and, ""Do I create false illusions of my own?"" by its conclusion. Well, do you? Be honest now.

Unfortunately, for a lot of people, they have to come to the plays resolution by following the drunken tumultuous lives of George and Martha who are lost in their everyday illusions. And, because misery loves company, George and Martha have a need to share their drunken tumultuous illusionary lives on young unsuspecting dinner guests. So if George and Martha ever invite you over for dinner? Don't expect any food, but the alcohol will be plentiful, and the conversation will be really interesting, in a very surreal kind of way.

After George and Martha's finish messing with the heads and lives of their dinner guests they're left to themselves, a quiet, calm moment befalls the main characters. In Albee's stage directions, he instructs that the final scene is played ""very softly, very slowly."" Martha reflectively asks if George had to extinguish the dream of their son. George believes it was time, and that now the marriage will be better without games and illusions.

The final conversation is a bit hopeful. Yet, when George asks if Martha is all right, she replies, ""Yes. No."" This implies that there is a mixture of agony and resolution. Perhaps she does not believe that they can be happy together, but she accepts the fact that they can continue their lives together, for whatever it is worth.

In the final line, George actually becomes affectionate. He softly sings, ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" while she leans against him. She confesses her fear of Virginia Woolf, her fear of living a life facing reality. It is perhaps the first time she reveals her weakness, and perhaps George is finally unveiling his strength with his willingness to dismantle their illusions.

Reality vs Illusions? Not being afraid of facing the Truth, or living a life of manufactured lies and fantasies? What's it going to be?

1195130,3,B000006FKX,"""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is an intense psychodrama starring the real-life couple, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  Much like their relationship in life, the relationship between the characters they play in this movie is tumultuous, volatile and destructive.

The film itself is a gripping study in psychology; nevertheless, the character development of the parties depicted in the films is somewhat shallow.  One is drawn to the plot in an effort to ascertain the root of the problem between Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) and George (Richard Burton).  In this viewer's opinion, the problem is never satisfactorily addressed.  Ultimately, this film is an instructional guide on how NOT to act in a relationship.",1393286400,,720,5.45045045045045

And then the ending was a total ""deus ex machina,"" where one event changes everything - but that event did not seem to draw on qualities the characters already had, but transformed them in a way that I could not find believable.

Acting, direction, were superlative, in fact it was the power of the production that made it so unpleasant to watch. Five stars for acting etc. no stars for ""enjoyment.""",1390262400,,691,4.702479338842975

1195193,5,B000006FKX,"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? stands as one of the most wonderful movies in the history of 60s cinema. Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, George Segal and Sandy Dennis give stellar performances in this sordid drama (Dennis won an Oscar for her performance). George and Martha (played by Burton and Taylor, respectively) have a troubled marriage. They're walking home after a late night party and invite Nick and his wife, Honey (played by Segal and Dennis, respectively) over for a nightcap and a visit, despite the late hour. Nick and Honey find themselves getting mixed up in the marital tension and exchange of cross words between George and Martha. After a while, they end up going out to a roadside diner where more of the drama ensues between George and Martha. (The movie is not suitable for kids to see.)
This movie was shot in glorious black and white to reflect the nature of the story and of the troubled marriage between George and Martha. The extras are great to see. The first two, which are documentaries, provide a wealth of information regarding the production in retrospect, and how the story transferred to the big screen from the play (I learned that the play was great). I have not seen the vintage ""Intimate Portrait"" of Elizabeth Taylor, or the other extra, but the two documentaries are enough to look at.
It was a wise decision for this movie to be shot in black and white. Reason being, the subject matter would retain all of the drama, and the performances of Burton, Taylor, Segal and Dennis would look a lot better. If this movie had been shot in color, the drama would not stand out, the acting performances would not be dramatic enough, and viewers would have difficulty understanding that the movie is a drama and not a comedy. The first documentary, ""Too Shocking for Its Time"" touches base on why it was shot in black and white instead of color. Here are several things about that:

1. The movie is a drama. Edward Albee said that when he saw that it was shot in black and white, and asked why it wasn't shot in color, he was told that movies that were dramas had to be shot in black and white, and movies that were musicals and comedies would be shot in color. (This is how it was with movies being made in the 1960s, which makes perfect sense.)
2. Dr. Drew Casper said that the movie's subject matter didn't lend itself to color. He added that the performances of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor would look more awful in black and white instead of color.
3. The cuts, framing and close-ups were another reason for the movie being shot in black and white. For this, the conditioning of how audiences saw drama at that time was that black and white would be more visceral, and that color would be more show-off.
4. In the scene where George and Martha have that bitter argument outside the roadside club, the sky in the background retains its darkness. If in color, the sky wouldn't be dark enough.

I totally agree with all of these things. This movie would not have looked good in color, and the drama would have been missing entirely. All dramas from the 60s look much better in black and white, so that the mood stands out better. I am also glad that this movie was not colorized, because, again, the drama would have been missing entirely from the story.

So, everything about this film is excellent. The acting is superb, and the extras are great to see.",1390003200,,3399,4.587171052631579
1195194,5,B000006FKX,"One description of this movie is that of a ""Dark Comedy."" I'm not sure I can agree with this interpretation, rather it's plot line is a dysfunctional marriage which works in a way only Albee's creative mind could create. Make no mistake, there is no book/movie like this. The story line is so unique and the convergence of Taylor's and Burtons stunning performance is unmatched. It is a movie for people who enjoy a rather coarse side of life, and is not one which leaves you feeling good. That said, to me it is a masterpiece.",1390003200,,527,4.5

Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were THE COUPLE to watch again and again in this once staged drama, much like their multiple marriages. The movie is neurotic, hilarious, kooky, high-pitched, even dangerous mix of human mess, all rolled into one three-in-the-morning, psycho-dramatic events of alcoholic madness on screen.  George Segal and Sandra Dennis played the heck out of their supporting characters, never to match their subsequent movie roles again.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Burton/dp/B00007G1WH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Burton</a>&nbsp;burns with quiet intensity that boils over at climactic moments. One moment his George is a henpecked husband, the other a manipulating, conniving, deliciously evil attacker. The other half of the film's cast - George Segal and Sandy Dennis, know they can't out-act Liz and Dick and their razor-sharp scrapping, so wisely, they under-act. George Segal is the everyman, thrust into an impossibly awkward situation, and Sandy Dennis (in another Oscar-winning performance) plays his ""slim-hipped"" wife - a sounding board for the fury building between George and Martha.

The dialogue is still razor-sharp and utterly perfect, with impossibly harsh profanity for it's day. Elizabeth Taylor was possibly the most beautiful woman alive circa the time of the film, but here Taylor chose to be seen as a un-glamoured, frumpy, annoying, lewd floozy. The cinematography is stark and the sets minimal but realistic - putting the focus on the actors. The score is excellent and the editing to die for.

The real focus on here, however, is on four brilliant actors. They always hold our attention, play with our emotions, keep us riveted, enthralled, disgusted, and squirming in our seats. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a movie like they don't make them anymore, but it never feels like a ""classic"",and to this day remains relevant, fresh, funny, and emotionally devastating.

In a time when most ""modern"" movies find the plot and acting taking a distant back seat to overwhelming effects and digital wizardry, this classic relies totally on the extraordinary performances of 4 artists and very skillful directing and editing. With no huge cast of thousands of digitized androids and the lack of an ear shattering soundtrack to numb the viewers mind, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf draws one into the complicated and dysfunctional lives of four characters, each fighting their own demons while verbally and at times physically, flailing on each other. It is not light, mindless viewing and can extract an emotional toll from the audience which in itself is a testament to the superb work of the principles. While there are many very talented actors in the industry today, it would be an impossible task to select a cast equal to these four stellar performers from among them.",1377302400,,924,4.89171974522293

1195367,5,B000006FKX,"""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" is an astonishing, exhausting film that must have raised quite a few eyebrows in 1966 for the language and subject matter. I must confess that I knew virtually nothing about this movie, and when some friends of mine said I absolutely HAD to watch it, I put it at the top of my queue, though I had no idea what to expect. No, Elizabeth Taylor does NOT play novelist Virginia Woolf. Instead, she and Richard Burton play the most dysfuntional, most co-dependent couple in the world who invite another couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over for a nightcap after a party. And WE, the viewers, are forced to participate in the increasingly nasty proceedings in a vicarious sort of way. I have to really hand it to Liz for her performance. Known heretofore for very glamorous roles, here she is completely over the top as the quintessential haridan. This is the movie most responsible for instigating the MPAA rating system, because audiences up to then were simply not accustomed to such frank language in a film.",1372464000,,1045,4.747252747252747

George is a professor and he and his wife Martha have a love-hate relationship. Urged by her influential  father, Martha invites a young couple to their home. Because of the late hour and lots of alcohol, the rest of the evening becomes a wild war full of nasty insults, hurtful games, and manipulation. Martha and George use their guests and go as far as physical violence. However, in the end secrets are uncovered and they realize that they truly are afraid of Virginia Woolf. What began as a joke became all too true. At points this film seemed to elude me but I will say the acting was intense and powerful.

1195387,5,B000006FKX,"It is difficult to believe that it has been 50 years since Edward Albee's 1963 eviscerating play `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Open on Broadway, and even more difficult to realize that three years later, in 1966, this cinematic version, with a screenplay by Ernest Lehman and directed brilliantly by Mike Nichols brought to the public's attention the special gifts of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as the alcoholic couple. It is a remarkable film and one that seems equally fine when we return to the DVD version so many years later.

George and Martha are a middle aged married couple, whose charged relationship is defined by vitriolic verbal battles, which underlies what seems like an emotional dependence upon each other. This verbal abuse is fueled by an excessive consumption of alcohol. George being an associate History professor in a New Carthage university where Martha's father is the President adds an extra dimension to their relationship. Late one Saturday evening after a faculty mixer, Martha invites Nick and Honey, an ambitious young Biology professor new to the university and his mousy wife, over for a nightcap. As the evening progresses, Nick and Honey, plied with more alcohol, get caught up in George and Martha's games of needing to hurt each other and everyone around them. The ultimate abuse comes in the form of talk of George and Martha's unseen sixteen year old son, whose birthday is the following day. That final moment, captured by Haskell Wexler's bracing black and white cinematography and underlined by Alex North's musical scoring, when the title of the play is asked by George in question from to the devastated Martha and she answers `I am' is a moment of cinematic history that deserves celebrating.

Times change and films change and the public seems more interested in massive superhero explosive 3D extravaganzas to avoid the doings of the time. But films such as this remind us how powerful small ensemble screen acting can be. This is not an escapist outing, this is an examination of how people act to influence, enhance and destroy each other.  It demands we think as well as react.

1195388,5,B000006FKX,"I remember reading a while back that Bette Davis was in the running to portray blowsy, bitter Martha because the mid 1960's Elizabeth Taylor was considered too young and beautiful for the role. And while I admit I would have been fascinated to have seen what Davis could have done with this part(absolutely LOVED her)I have to also say that Liz Taylor seems predestined for Martha, just as Richard Burton was for George. This dark, disturbing, supremely witty classic showcases Burton/Taylor at their absolute A game BEST. It's possible at times to forget you are watching actors act...not a real life middle aged couple taking an emotional pick-axe to their marriage and to one another. The only other time in my life that I have actually forgotten I was watching an actor at his craft was when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis portray Abraham Lincoln recently. The fact that Richard Burton didn't not win the Best Actor Oscar that year annoys me to this day.

I own this on DVD-it's one of my Top Five all time favorite films-and I pull it out every now and then to marvel, gasp and giggle yet again...sometimes all at once. Every single performance is brilliant including George Segal and Sandy Dennis as George and Martha's unfortunate cocktail party guests.

1195465,5,B000006FKX,"Mike Nichols' adaptation of Edward Albee's award-winning, deeply polarizing play begins rather slowly, but don't expect it to remain in stasis. In fact, the opening sequence of the two elderly academics trundling home from a faculty party is deceptively easy and almost loving. There is yet no indication that the following events will contain some of the most pointed, venomous verbal attacks ever committed to celluloid. The movie is darkly hilarious as it gathers momentum. Two couples, locked in a room, digging at one another with drunken fervor. George and Martha are old-school heavyweights. Martha's father maintains a high post in the university in which George is employed, much to everyone's chagrin. George is, in Martha's eyes, and perhaps his own, a flaccid little failure. He amounts to little more than ""a BOG in the History Department."" The new meat on the chopping block, as it were, arrive in the form of Nick and Honey: the former occupying a seat in the Biology department--a topic of great interest for George. After a few drinks are poured (okay, more than a few), the film bolts forth into a series of increasingly alienating and uncomfortable psychological mind games--some of which turn physical. Do not let the B&W disarm you, this is a bitter, barbed-wire wit film that makes recent cranky couple pictures like Polanski's Carnage look decidedly calm by comparison. Albee and Nichols have a dream cast to work with, particularly Taylor and Burton, who turn in performances the likes of which are rarely scene in conventional cinema. They are razor-sharp, dirty, scaldingly cruel. The mastery of the film is that there are few moments when one wishes to actually leave their company. In less capable hands, most audience members would be out the door after the first Act, when things really start to turn ugly. Don't leave early or you'll miss the inevitable game of ""hump the hostess"" (one of the words which drew so much controversy upon the film's initial release (though curiously in the updated version of the play for the '00s the only words Albee really added are F-words, but I digress)).

Despite the great cast and acting, I feel nothing from these people. To Martha and George, I just feel like telling them to shut the **** up. Nobody goes on and on about nothing at all like a drunk.

Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe is like a great lesson on the emotional toxicity between a husband and wife. The main characters say and do things to each other that you will not believe, or maybe you will. By the way, the husband receives the bulk of the abuse.

1195487,5,B000006FKX,"Sadly, there are very few films that are capable of eliciting a visceral reaction out of me. However, Mike Nichol's 1966 debut film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, is such a powerful film on so many levels that I cannot imagine anybody watching it without being significantly moved. The film is based on Edward Albee's Tony Award winning play and covers the events of one very long and alcohol induced night. It follows the plight of an aging couple George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor). When friends Nick (George Segal)  and Honey (Sandy Dennis) come over for a nightcap, they become caught in the middle of a series of games in which George and Martha take their pain and attempt to push each other to the breaking point. Albee's dialogue is explosive, both in terms of being emotionally charged and how it is projected, and is adeptly handled by the entire cast.. There is a brilliant mix of temperamental humor and anguish which includes one of my favorite lines, ""There isn't an abomination award going that you haven't won.""
While Albee's superb script provides a well-built chassis for the film, it is Nichol's direction mixed with Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography that makes this film really take off. Often times the camera will capture the scene as if it were merely a fly on the wall. However, Nichols really knows the material and will zoom in to the point of intrusion when a character feels emotionally isolated or verbally backed into a corner. In one particularly distinguished scene that deviates from the play, Nichols captures George walking into the back of the house when the Martha and the guests are still conversing in the living room. Even though George is out of ear shot of the others, Nichols keeps the audio of their conversation going while he follows George. This illuminates the extent of Martha's deviance as George can still knows that Martha will be speaking ill of him even when he is not in her company. Also, in the same vein as a noir, Nichols uses mirrors to show how these characters never take a good hard look at themselves and what they have become. One is even shoved in the face of George at one point, yet he is too steeped in his own misery to even see the man on the other side.
The performances here are simply astounding by all players involved. Although Taylor would nab the Oscar for best actress, I really feel as though Burton was snubbed. While his character could have just been watered down to nothing more than a dispensary of caustic wit, Burton injects a sense of humanity into the character that is present in the smallest of gestures.
Historically, this film is bold as it was produced in some of the most impassioned years of the civil rights movement.  These years saw a mass movement to finally put an end to the anti-miscegenation laws that had previously prevented interracial marriages in America. This film shows that even white upper-middleclass marriages, which were seen as a bulwark against the decay of the human race, had their blemishes.
In the end, it is a beautiful film about a volatile relationship. It is about pain and the fiction that we manufacture in order to deal with it. The film isn't easy to watch, but if you do you will find that this is an absolutely astounding film.",1300579200,,3289,4.7282229965156795
1195488,4,B000006FKX,"Opening in 1962, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? blindsided audiences of the so-called ""Camelot"" era: everyone who saw it was shocked by its profanity, sexual content, unrelenting verbal viciousness, and its sharp and unswerving portrait of hidden disillusionment. People who dislike the play--and there are many--tend to describe it as three hours of unattractive people screaming at each other, and it is therefore tempting to think of the play as a critic's darling that lacks popular appeal. Nothing could be less true. The original production ran well over six hundred performances; the play has had two major Broadway revivals to date; it has been performed by virtually every professional, academic, and community theatre in the English-speaking world; and, of course, was translated into an extremely popular and award-winning film. If anything, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is even more popular today than it was when the play opened fifty years ago.

The basic story is extremely well known. George (Richard Burton) is an associate college professor; his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor)  is the college president's daughter. They have attended a faculty party and now return home very tired and more than a little drunk. George looks forward to bed and sleep--but Martha informs him she has invited a new professor and his wife to join them for drinks. George is not enthusiastic but he agrees, although he warns Martha not to discuss their son. When Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) arrive, also tired and more than a little drunk, they find themselves an unwilling audience to George and Martha's vicious verbal sparring. They are quickly sucked into the battle, and when Martha tells her guests about her son, George determines to put an end to their verbal games once and for all. But can Martha, their guests, even George survive the unflinching light of reality? The play is extremely, extremely funny in its dialogue, and Albee displays wit that is equal to the likes of Noel Coward and Oscar Wilde; even so, laughter is the rug that is constantly pulled out from under foot to send the characters reeling on their collision courses, and the play itself is dark and painful.

Over the years many people have complained about the play's ending, which like such recent films as THE SIXTH SENSE and MULLHOLLAND DRIVE suddenly forces the audiences to question everything they have been told over the course of the entire evening. How much of it was real? The story about the boxing match, was that true? The story about the boy who killed his parents, was that true? The play does not simply end on a note of uncertainty, it ends with a deeply disquieting sense of wonder. Who would put themselves through such a display in an effort to maintain their fantasies and illusions? Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf--afraid to look at their lives in the unflinching light of hard reality? Aren't we all, to at least some degree?

There are three fundamental problems with the film.  The first is that it almost entirely misses the humor that is so much a part of the original play, a wicked hilarity that rocks the audience by making them laugh and then snatching the rug out from under their feet by turning the laughter into cruelty and vindictiveness.  The second is that, although they give excellent performances, it does not seem to me that the Burton-Taylor-Segal-Dennis quartet manage to capture the vulnerability that lurks behind their characters' facades, nor does the film completely grasp the play's ultimate pathos.  But most significantly, this is a show that belongs to the theatre, not the screen.  It really does require living, breathing actors on the stage in front of your eyes to bring the story to its full, jaw-dropping effect; without the actors live before you, the thing veers toward a ""talking heads"" style.  All of that said, it is nonetheless a stunning effort to capture one of the 20th century's most important plays on film.  Many have described this as Elizabeth Taylor's best dramatic performance.  Perhaps--but if so, Burton is not far behind, and although George Segal is not greatly memorable he is at least adequate, and Sandy Dennis is a knock-out in what could easily be a thankless, unimportant role.

The double DVD edition is worth the money only for the audio commentaries; the other bonus materials range from fairly interesting to so-so to tiresome.  But the film itself is near-mint in picture and audio elements (the later a particular blessing, for previous DVD releases have been extremely problematic with sound.)  Recommended.

1195492,5,B000006FKX,"This film is monumental. There is no other way to describe the power of the screenplay based on the Edward Albee play and the exceptional acting other than to use superlatives. Elizabeth Taylor provides us the most outstanding acting on film by an actress. Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis are all in top form. Taylor and Burton did a series of films together but none compare to this masterpiece. This is not a film for everyone. It is a work of art and therefore open to interpretation and layered with meaning upon meaning. Some folks don't like complexity, strong irrational emotion, and a script where every word and line had meaning and double meaning. For them, this film is probably a nightmare.

Mike Nichol's direction must have been exceptional to produce such a crisp trip into the ambiguity of human relations, as exemplified in the lives of college professor George, played by Richard Burton, and his wife Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor. The use of black and white film, as in the outstanding film The Miracle Worker, heightens emotions and drama.

Elizabeth Taylor is a fine actress but in this film she is in top form. The character of Martha is a boiling kettle of unsatisfied desire, ambition, and intimacy. She is full of anger and hysteria, and yet vicious and cunning as any jungle cat. Alcohol only fuels her outbursts of self-loathing despair and fury. The target of much of her fury is her husband George. He is the one with whom she feels safe enough to viciously attack and still expect him to be there in the morning. He is the one who has committed the crime of loving her when deep down she knows she is not worthy of love. He is the one who knows her true vulnerabilities and thus he is always a threat if he selects to use truth as his weapon. All humans weave stories to make reality bearable, to make their existence make sense, to give some tiny piece of meaning to the absurdity. Relationships often require that we support each other's self created narratives. When anger, resentment, erupts in a relationship, what more caustic weapon can there be than to attack and pull down the defenses and protective narrative that our partner has built around them to survive.  Rarely have we seen two people peel away each other's illusions and self constructing stories with such verbal surgical precision as is seen in this outstanding drama. Richard Burton is the other half of this painful equation, a man with dark unresolved secrets who marries a woman who will be his constant warden and torturer. He is a man with sin who is daily bombarded with his sin by his psychological jailer wife. George Segal and Sandy Dennis are perfect as a young couple on the verge of a life of resentment and pain not unlike that of George and Martha.

Edward Albee's skill with the English language is in top form in this play. George and Martha play vicious emotional games, changing the rules just as soon as the other catches on and starts to develop a protective strategy.  Ever word becomes a bomb.  Ernest Lehman's adapted screenplay is sharp as a knife.

As other critics have noted, this film is important in that it merges the psychological dramatic tradition of Eugene O'Neil, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams with the absurdist, existential works of Samuel Becket and Eugene Ionesco. Sometimes the words used a weapons sound like lines from Waiting for Godot and then with raw emotion they sound like Long Day's Journey into Night.

For psychologically aware and experienced adults, this film is the genuine article.",1269820800,,3566,4.768233387358185
1195493,5,B000006FKX,"I find myself emotionally attached to a lot of films.  I tend to find bits and pieces of myself, less literally and more figuratively, in a lot of films.  I think that is important for an avid movie-goer, for it allows you to truly connect and glean from the experience.  While I say this, I do admit that there are few films that reflect my own personal experiences, but when they come along they completely dominate me.  One such film was Ingmar Bergman's `Scenes from a Marriage'.  I saw a lot of my own personal relationships in that film.

Another such film is `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'.

One of the most powerfully authentic films of all time, `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is a stunning example of pure depth and genuine characterization.  The film is one of the most effective social commentaries I've ever seen, and as a character study it is nothing short of spellbinding (and the definition of haunting).  I had seen this film a few years back and rendered it a masterpiece even then, but rewatchng the film recently has added layers of meaning and importance to the film for me, most likely due to recent personal experiences.

The film, adapted from Edward Albee's stage play, takes place on a single evening, after a party, when middle-aged couple Martha and George entertains a younger couple, Nick and Honey.  It is apparent from the films very first scene that Martha and George have a near volatile relationship.  They are heavy drinkers and heavy bickerers and they know how to push one another's buttons.  When Nick and Honey arrive at their home, it is instantly obvious to the two that this was not a good idea.  Despite their desire to leave, they are persuaded (or commanded) to stay.  They are soon entwined (thanks to heavy amounts of alcohol) in a figurative boxing match between Martha and George as they begin to unravel before this young couple, exposing themselves and each other and soon their new companions in a sickly twisted game that takes on a life of its own.

I've heard some refer to this as a movie about the adverse effects of alcoholism, but that is just simplifying the film far too much.

This film is, without doubt, about the crushing power of regret.  Nick and Honey torment Martha and George with their mere presence because they represent a past that seems to far removed from who they became.  Throughout the film, Martha and George constantly berate one another for the course they took and what it is that they have amounted to.  They have lost all mutual respect for one another because they blame one another for their own shortcomings and grievances.  It is apparent, through drunken confessions, that Nick and Honey are headed in a similar direction.  The couples, while different, are similar in many ways.  They are both very reliant on their families for their positions; both men relying on their fathers-in-law in ways that surely is demeaning to their masculinity.  Both men also feel a strange resentment to their wives for similar reasons, most likely stemming from their obvious dependence on them.  Both couples are wearing figurative masks, hiding who they are in an attempt to become something the only wish they could be.  Therein lies the significance of the song `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", a song sung in times of destructive desperation.  For these `intellectuals', Virginia Woolf represents a public image they strive to conform to.  To be `afraid' of Virginia Woolf (an author regarded as complex) would underscore their vulnerability and make them appear weak, especially to themselves.  So, figuratively, they refuse to acknowledge their fears, putting up a front to conceal them from the hurt they have caused themselves.

And then there is the `child', a metaphor for different choices and a different life; a life without regret.

So, the reason I say that this film affects me more now is that after twelve years of marriage and for years of friendship (with me) my best friend (now EX best friend) and his wife turned into Martha and George.  They became self consumed, self centered and self destructive and their own bitter resentment at their own state of affairs left them void of all emotional morality.  It's oddly uncomfortable to relate so deeply to this film.  The sad truth is that I've seen all of this happen.  I've seen the drunken fights, the loud and abrasive belittlements.  I've felt the tense aroma of resentment fill a home and I've personally been attacked and dissected by someone I considered a friend, all so that he could feel better about himself.

The fact that Martha and George are not the exception but the rule is a scary and sobering fact.

This story, as weighty as it is, would be nothing without the performances that embody it.  In my personal opinion, Elizabeth Taylor's Oscar win can rest alongside Vivian Leigh's (for `A Streetcar Named Desire') as one of the most deserved in the history of Oscar.  The way she expertly crafts this performance from scene to scene is just utterly brilliant.  She can come across over-the-top to some, but when taken in the context of the film (this is a theatrical adaptation) it serves the film gloriously, and her final moments, as the camera draws in to see her soul collapse, are some of the most genuinely tender examples of humanity at its rawest that I've ever seen.  Matching her every step of the way is Richard Burton, who understands his characters bitterness and the sarcastic apathy he uses to mask his true feelings.  I also consider George Segal's performance to be simply stunning.  I saw so much of myself in him (scary), from the way he eases into confessions with George to the way he fights his own discomfort for the sake of his hosts.  He knows that what is happening is wrong and will destroy him in the long run, but he lacks the ability to walk away.  Sandy Dennis is the weak link here, but her character has the smallest arc (and the smallest amount of screen time) and thus she kind of suffers from being overshadowed and so she seems to try and overcompensate at times.  In the long run, it works, but at times she can come off as a bit much.

In the end, `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is certainly one of the most important films in the history of cinema, a film that was and still is a poignant look at humanity at its rawest form.  Director Mike Nichols was pure genius here, creating a film that practically foamed at the mouth with authentic and heartfelt tension and aggression.  Accompanied by slick editing, noteworthy dialog and some of the most effective (and beautifully shot) black and white cinematography (how a single room can evoke so much emotion is beyond me), `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is a rarity among film; and film that is flawless.",1268870400,,6771,4.740392826643894

1195516,3,B000006FKX,"There are a few distinctively American artists -- Norman Mailer comes immediately to mind. And then there are many more pale imitators of European art that happen to be American, and are rewarded because of American chauvinism. Edward Albee falls into the latter camp. There's something powerful and authentic when Samuel Beckett and Albert Camus write about the meaningless and absurdity of the human condition but when Edward Albee writes there's something wildly immature and annoying.

Albee's first work ""Zoo Story"" which is a childish imitation of ""Waiting for Godot"" can be forgiven as exactly that: a childish imitation. But what are Albee's excuses for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?""

George (Richard Burton) is a middle-aged small-town college history professor who is married to the college president's daughter Martha (Elizabeth Taylor). Once full of promise and vitality George now resorts to alcohol and bitter violent fights with Martha to pass the time. One night they invite over a couple who are a younger, much more vibrant version of themselves -- and the two take this as an opportunity to reflect on the life they cursed themselves with.

Because Edward Albee is considered a genius and because ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" is considered one of the greatest films of all time I searched for meaning and substance in the film, and after forty minutes I became desperately bored, began fast forwarding, and then eventually just gave up. There were moments when I did feel that the film was trying to say something but decided it wasn't true because the film didn't really develop that theme and that theme was really juvenile anyway -- I mean, would a serious playwright use for his masterwork the theme that marrying for money and position will only make you miserable?

In the end I could only conclude that this film is merely a visual projection of all the anxieties and phobias, self-loathing and narcissims -- in short, the collected mental masturbation -- of a playwright who just happens be homosexual and childish and depressed. The articulate protagonist is a stand-in for the playwright, someone so witty and luminous yet underappreciated by the world and trapped in an impossible situation with a hysterical wife. The wife Martha represents either the playwright's mother or just a generic impression of all women: violent and insane, selfish and self-indulgent, a whore and a witch.

Albee then takes this disjointed and incoherent worldview, and slaps on a flimsy and hackneyed plot, and puts it on stage -- and everyone calls it art and genius. So why do you hate yourself and the world so much, Mr. Albee, when life is this easy and wonderful?

To be fair this play was written almost half a century ago when psychology wasn't so developed. Back then they did not understand what was ""co-dependency"" and ""bipoloar depression"" and ""borderline personality disorder"" and writers could only re-create these things on paper from the rough sketches of their personal lives. But so what? Great writers are great because they are overly attuned into the peculiar nuances of the human condition: Shakespeare did not have to major in psychology to create the convincing and powerful psychological portraits of Hamlet and MacBeth and King Lear and Othello.

It is perhaps all too common to fear and to misunderstand something, and then quickly dismiss it as ""crazy"" or worse ""genius."" ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" is in the lucky position to find itself labelled as ""genius"" by a society that fears and misunderstands it more than it appreciates and understands it.",1257811200,,3598,5.057335581787521

1195519,5,B000006FKX,"I was rather surprised on actually looking up the information to find out that I'd only seen, as far as I can be sure, 5 films starring Elizabeth Taylor and 4 starring her husband at the time this one was made, Richard Burton.  That and not having a really clear impression of director Mike Nichols' work, nor having read the Edward Albee play on which the film is based or really knowing much about it besides the typical, often derisive comment that it's ""2 hours of people screaming at each other"", made me able to watch this film from a position of relative ignorance, which I think made some difference.  What little I had seen with Taylor was mostly forgotten, and what I did remember wasn't so positive - she had struck me as a lightweight with a kind of breathless and vapid air about her; and Burton I remembered also from some of his lesser work and action movies that didn't take a lot of chops.  So I was altogether unprepared...

A full moon, clouds moving over it, in sharp black and white.  Dissolve to a pan from treetops down to a distant building, in the dark, in the fall with the leaves blowing, a college campus perhaps, a man and a woman slowly walking towards the camera, then passing behind a tree, another dissolve to an overhead shot, they look like dolls...George (Burton) an Associate Professor of History at an unnamed small college, and Martha (Taylor) his wife, both in their late 40s or so, walking home after an event.  Entering their old two-story house, Martha exclaims, ""What a dump"" in an exaggerated tone and then proceeds to badger George to tell her what film it's from.  They banter back and forth, getting progressively more testy; they go upstairs, lie on the bed, and Martha starts singing ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (to the tune of ""Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush"") as they start acting more tenderly; it was all a game, perhaps?

Then Martha informs George that she's invited a younger couple over; they were at a faculty party it seems, and Martha had an eye on the young man (George Segal, his character never named) who with his young wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) shows up a few moments later, as both George and Martha are getting more liquored up - and more bitchy with each other.  The young couple comes in, more drinks are poured, the fighting continues, the dialogue intensifies, then dies, then re-ignites, like a fugue, like the wonderful Alex North score which at all times reminds us of the tenderness lying underneath the hostility in a marriage that clearly did not turn out the way either party wanted it to - but is nonetheless the defining, central, impossible-to-give-up element in both lives.  So it continues for two hours, as Martha seduces the young man; as both Martha and George try to outdo each other in ferocity and cruelty, as physical violence seems just around the corner, and a kiss and tears around the next.  And always there is wit, and always there is the drama of wondering how, and if, the younger couple will seek to escape this dark path that lies as an example in front of them; and always there is more and more liquor.

There's never a dull moment, never even a merely OK moment in this spectacularly compelling, funny, and heartwrending piece of work.  Haskell Wexler's laserlike sharp, high-contrast photography conveys the shadowy world of noir or crime drama, the underbelly of this tormented couple's lives, but also a fantastic never-never land - a swing out back, the roadhouse down the way, a strange beauty of nightly creation and destruction as George and Martha over and over approach and ultimately reject any kind of lasting understanding of each other, circling like the mobile camera that Nichols directs like a master on only his first film.  North's score I've mentioned, which evokes Bach and Handel, the classical world of George's bookish life, gentle harp and guitar and other strings for the most part, a calmness in the midst of the crazy inner worlds in front of us.

But it is the actors who are the reason we're watching this, after all, and none of them disappoint.  Sandy Dennis and George Segal, at the very beginnings of their careers, hold their own as the alternately frightened and excited young couple, he ambivalent about a marriage out of necessity and a wealthy father-in-law, she a secret heavy drinker and apparently full of sickness-inducing guilt, perhaps out of the marriage, perhaps out of other mysterious reasons.  Taylor and Burton, though, are the reasons you're probably watching the film, and they both so far transcend what I knew of them or thought they could do that it was like watching them for the first time.  Taylor was only 33 - at least 15 years too young - when shooting started, and put on 30 pounds, lowered her voice and seemed to have ripped all sweetness out of her manner - except for those rare moments when both Liz, and the Martha as she must have been, are allowed to emerge.  She seems every bit the disillusioned romantic, a last vestige of the pre-feminist era who knows that there is more to life than her husband, but has never found it and doesn't even really know where to look.  She's ferocious, catty, and always angling because she always knows that she's still got it.  Her slight upper-crust accent seems to fade in and out in tune with the role she's playing at that moment - scorned wife, loving wife, angry and profane drunk, would-be-intellectual who can't keep up with her husband, snobby daughter of the college president - and much more.  Burton is, if anything, even more impressive, though perhaps I'm giving him that mostly for having a slightly larger role, and for being in essence the tragic hero - the man who could never be the great scholar that he wanted to be, the political mover in the school that his wife and father-and-law expected, the lover that she wanted, the father...but that would spoil it.

Albee's best-known work beside the 1962 play on which this was based may be his slightly earlier absurdist ""Zoo Story"", which is on the surface closer to fantasy than VIRGINIA WOOLF; but this film (and I assume the play) skirts the borders of reality throughout it's length, with at least a couple of moments (stories, really) which are never particularly explained and left very much up to us to decipher or interpret.  Is the ""Bergin"" story that he tells the young man and that gets repeated later, more drunkenly, more angrily, George's real memory of what a schoolmate went through?  Is it George's own experience?  Is it that of the son"", apparently made up, that George and Martha could never have? Is it entirely something from his own imagination, but played out with Martha endlessly in different versions, to different couples and with variations on other games, on previous nights, year after year?

All good things, all good movies, all bad nights and fantastic nights and hard dark nights of the soul must come to the end, and so does VIRGINIA WOOLF die with a whimper, softly, gently, tenderly....desperately.

In a world where Oscars are given for the performance of a decade Elizabeth Taylor would win it hands down because she sizzles, absolutely sizzles, in the characterization of a bitter wife who see-saws from the sensual, to the cynical and finally, to the pitiable.  Richard Burton delivers a smash portrayal, evoking sympathy during the public degradations to which his wife subjects him and is totally believable in the deliverance of his deliberate vengeance.  Dennis and Segal as the late night visitors are the dream supporting duo.

Richard Burton is so hacked to peices, and Elizabeth Taylor preys on him with unrelenting fury, and then he turns on her, she on him, and again and again, until the tables have turned so much, we are in a kind of dervish, whirling in chaos and despair.

There is humor in this, and it ties in with Edward Albee's sense of an anguish lurking in the backgrounds of these people, the utter impossibility of right reason or relationship in any kind of existence you could mention.

1195523,5,B000006FKX,"This has got to be the best portrayal of a difficult marriage that has ever hit the screen.  It is so real, so intelligent, so funny, and so pathetic that it is worth viewing at every period of one's life.  Nothing portrays the complexity of living together in disharmony as this film does.  They hate eachother, they love eachother, they find themselves stuck in realities and games of their own making, to the awestruck horror of their young guests who appear to be on the same path.

You have Martha, who is spoiled, self-destructive, an alcohol abuser, and lover.  At lucid moments, fuelled by alcohol, she gets glimpses into what she is doing to their marriage.  She reproaches herself, yet plays the game with relentless cruelty and energy.  George appears hapless, stuck in a career that dooms him to mediocrity and scorn by the woman he continues to love and despise.  But he is smart and witty and devious.  Underneath, there appears (at least to me) to be much that is good in both of them, but it is submerged in their frustration at stalled lives.

As a young student, I saw this and was horrified.  Why don't they divorce?  That is the natural question.  Isn't it over, given the horror on display with such nakedness in front of their naive guests?  Then, in middle age, you can recognize what you have seen in so many couples:  the rage at personal limits and perhaps fate, turned on the partner as blame, yet the core of caring still intact in unguarded moments.  They operate within boundaries of their own devising, but even these no longer work for some reason.  SOmething has changed, some vital turning point reached or breached.  Is it broken, the end?  Or is it an indication of some new way forward?  My reading of the film is that it is ambiguous and up to them - just like in real life.  If there anything positive left?  Or will they kill eachother?

If you can take it, this is an utterly mesmerizing film, so real in its portrayal of living dysfunction that its power cannot be denied.  While my own marriage never reached such a depth of enmity and emotional violence, it is a place that any realist should fear to tread.  After all, you never understand how easy marriage was until it no longer works.

1195534,5,B000006FKX,"Elizabeth Taylor won her second Academy Award as Best Actress in 1966 for her portrayal of acid-tongue, foul-mouthed Martha in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"". The film is one of the best movies Hollywood has ever made, and it stars an ensemble of actors rarely seen together in film. Liz's husband at the time, Richard Burton, co-stars as George, the man Martha belittles and disrespects, and Sandy Duncan and George Segal are cast in the supporting roles as Honey and Nick, who are invited to George and Martha's late one night. The film was raw for its time as it featured language never before heard on film. The movie is based on the Broadway play starring Uta Hagen, and many thought Liz could never pull off such a demanding role. For Martha Liz gained 30 lbs, wore a grey wig, and virtually became this character. Liz's portrayl is one of the best female performances on the big screen and it solidified her as an actress with a caliber that many do not possess. Even Joan Crawford became a fan of Liz's after viewing the film.
 The movie still holds the record as being the only film that received Oscar nominations for every award that it was eligible for. It won five Oscars, including one for Sandy Dennis.
 Mike Nichols directed the film, and he is known by modern audiences as the director of ""The Birdcage"" starring Robin Williams, and as being Diane Sawyer's husband.
 The DVD is full of bonus features, including commentary by Nichols, documentaries on the film, screen tests, and more.

1195535,5,B000006FKX,"When Edward Albee in 1962 published his latest play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", Broadway was in an uproar. Never before such foul language was heard on a stage and the topics it touched on were not exactly of a nature likely to be discussed as explicitly outside the privacy of one's home if ever for that matter. A nomination of the prestigious Pulitzer Prize was, also due to its vocabulary, denied.

Together with Tennessee Williams' play ""A Streetcar named Desire"" this play is nowadays seen as the most important post-war (the second one) play in US history.

Four years after its publication in 1966 a movie adaptation was undertaken by Mike Nichols and as it was his directorial debut the studio was taking a chance. (A few years down the road Nichols would win a first Oscar for ""The Graduate"")

The movie was awarded two Oscars because of two of its four leads: Elizabeth Taylor as best actress in the part of Martha (and never was an award more deserved!!!) and Sandy Dennis as best supporting actress playing Honey. To this day (and I believe I'm not alone in this) I consider it an outrage that at the very least Richard Burton wasn't given an Oscar for best actor as George, but in the end I guess that's all not very important.

Both Taylor and Burton in this movie probably are giving their best performance ever as Martha and George, who are having a marriage to put it charmingly like a sewer, that time and again they relish opening up again with a sick satisfaction playing an eternal game of truth and illusion, that both have lost their way in such a long time ago that any sense of perspective has vanished.

The movie starts with Martha and George on a university campus, where George teaches in the History department while Martha is the daughter of the University's dean, as they are walking home after a social event that has left them both rather drunk and soon, as they get home, in a mood out for blood.

Like the play the movie has three acts, central to each of them is a ""game"":
Humiliate the Host
University's latest newcomers Nick (George Segal) and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) arrive at George and Martha's house to brighten up the evening. One could argue they may represent what George and Martha were like early in their relationship while in reverse George and Martha would be the young couple's ultimate nightmare of their future, though it would constitute a gross simplification, but it's an interesting question to ponder.
During the game at hand George and Martha ruthlessly attack each other verbally to the utter dismay of their guests, who, also imbued by alcohol consumption, take turns being either shocked and transfixed by their hosts. Each game has its rules and when Martha breaks one by talking to Honey about their (George and Martha's) son, George counters with a series of verbal blows against Martha that well and truly start a bloody battle between them.

Get the Guest
The guests however are not left out in all this and when Nick in an inebriated state entrusts George with a painful private secret, George uses it mercilessly against him, when Nick, ignoring George's warnings, encourages Martha in yet another humiliating tirade of hers.
The young couple is in shock and hurt. Martha and George make a declaration to each other of all out total war.

Bringing up Baby
The final game is a crushing psychological check-mate attempt by George against Martha relating to the truth about their son.
The ultimate shattering of the illusion and naked vulnerability of the truth is, having avoided it for years, even more frightful.
Martha's answer to George's final question ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" unsurprisingly is: ""I am George, I am"".

The couple has arrived at the beginning of new kind of truth and by surrendering the illusion a careful step is made towards a future both uncertain and without any guarantee of happiness, but at least with a glimmer of hope.

This impressive play/movie illustrates the raw feelings in a turbulent relationship, created around a secret of personal loss so painful, that the pain had to go somewhere to survive it and so both partners inflicted it on each other. Finally, worn out from years of battle, there is nowhere left to go but face the truth about themselves and look at each other to find the bravery to try and make a new choice, try a new path.",1234828800,,4369,4.721784776902887

1195540,5,B000006FKX,"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a captivating, dynamic film about just how cruel people can be to each other when relationships just don't go right. The action moves along at a good pace without ever being the slightest bit boring; and the acting is very convincing. We get especially noteworthy performances from Elizabeth Taylor as Martha and Richard Burton as George, an unhappily married couple who resort to liquor and abusive behavior to cope with a loveless marriage; and the apparently lovely young couple Martha and George ""entertain for a nightcap"" have their own demons exposed before the night is over.

When the film begins, Martha and George have just left a party at the university where George is an associate professor. One of Martha's cruelest tricks is to verbally abuse George because he never rose above the associate professor position; her father is a highly powerful man at the school and they were hoping that someday George would be up to the challenge of running the history department. Of course, George has his own complaints about Martha, including his belief that her remarkably abusive behavior and game playing is disgusting--to say the least. George Segal and Sandy Dennis play a young married couple, Nick and Honey, who come to George and Martha's home after the party--only for Martha to essentially hold them hostage. That way Nick and Honey  can witness the cruelties Martha and George inflict on each other when they're fighting at their worst. Martha and George even fight over their son; and it's only at the end of the movie that we find out more about their son and the depth of his importance for their relationship.

This is no movie for small children. There's violence, foul language and many blunt comments about men chasing women for money and power (which both George and Nick have done). However, if you want to see great performances and what is very possibly Elizabeth Taylor's greatest performance ever on film, you're in luck--this movie is just the ticket! The fact that this was filmed in black and white serves to highlight the darkness of people's souls; and black and white instead of color makes the film more powerful than it would have been if they had filmed it in color.

The second disc has a good amount of extras. There is the outstanding and fascinating retrospective on Elizabeth Taylor's career from 1975 hosted by Peter Lawford; and I also liked the featurettes entitled ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Too Shocking for Its Time"" and """"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: A Daring Work of Raw Excellence."" There are excerpts of an interview of director Mike Nichols from July of 1966 as well. The first DVD with the movie on it has a running commentary.

Overall, this movie is great for fans of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; and fans of George Segal and Sandy Dennis will also enjoy this film. Some people may think that the entire film should have been shot in George and Martha's house to create an even tighter dramatic effect.

You feel slightly uncomfortable that they do it in front of their guests but later it's apparent that fighting is their comfort zone. Fighting keeps them safe and from facing a very serious reality-a very grim, dark secret they both share. Nick and Honey are pawns in their psychological game.

A lot of specific information about how the play ended up pretty much whole in a still code-ridden era. Good new documentaries about the film and a minor one about Taylor's career round out the package.

The film itself is a definite classic, maybe a bit too serious in tone, whereas a good production of the play is riotously funny. This seems pretty heavy going and somber most of the way through because they felt they had to be so in order to pass muster with the censors.

All four of the stars are perfect. Burton probably has his finest moments ever on screen, and there's nothing like this anywhere else in Taylor's career.

The plot is a puzzlement, but that's as it should be. This is not THE VIPS, BOOM or THE SANDPIPER. In fact, it's not a Taylor/Burton film at all. It's an honest attempt to turn one of the top pieces of dramatic literature in the last half of the 20th Century into a marketable big studio film. It isn't destroyed, as is so often the case. Although, to listen to Nichols on the commentary. it came dangerously close.",1215993600,,1249,4.517699115044247
1195567,5,B000006FKX,"I'm not sure how many people would agree with me, but after watching this movie again I was struck by something that I'd never noticed before. (Spoiler alert.)

First, I've seen this movie about a dozen times over the years, and like most people, what always stuck with me was the level of psychological damage that these two characters inflict upon each other. Edward Albee seems particularly sharp in showing how self-contempt and contempt for one's partner become symbiotic in ""dysfunctional"" relationships. George needs Martha's contempt as well as her love, just as she needs his contempt as well as his love. For them, the two emotions are two sides of the same coin--to such an extent that each emotion even seems to be a manifestation of the other. I've never seen a film that captures this psychological chemistry as powerfully as Nichols's adaptation, and the Burton-Taylor performances are truly remarkable. One can only guess how much the actors recognized these emotions in their own lives.

Moreover, when one eventually realizes the sort of ""game"" that's being played, the bizarre nature of the premise seems to be a pretty striking commentary on how our intimate relationships are based on understandings that are only exposed as ""fictions"" (or rather, only become ""fictions"") when consensus no longer exists. However weird the whole setup is with George and Martha's ""son,"" Albee seems to have meant it as only a more extreme, exaggerated illustration of this dynamic. When our relationships begin to erode, the premises or assumptions that they've been based on begin to erode as well. If George and Martha's son can be taken literally as a sort of psychic ""buffer"" or ""crutch"" they've created to sustain their tenuous marriage, the son can also be taken as a sort of metaphor for such unspoken premises in any relationship. Their pathology, I think, has a certain level of psychological truth that applies in a less extreme way to ""normal"" relationships as well.

But what really hit me this time was something else. What I never fully appreciated about this film is that for all its psychological violence, for all the outbursts and cruel mind games that we see on display, the film ends with George and Martha still together--quietly, hesitantly considering whether they can now start their relationship on some new basis without the sustaining fiction of their ""son."" True, there are no guarantees here, but I think that any view of this film as overly bleak is very misguided. If anything, George and Martha's relationship actually has a much greater chance of surviving than the sort of marriage in which each person has given up on each other for good. I won't go into details, but suffice it to say that I've seen what a truly numbing, deadening effect that failed marriages can have on people. Compared to what I've seen, George and Martha's story resonates with vitality in all its sound and fury, and the final scene brought tears to my eyes not because of what they'd lost--but for what they still have the chance to preserve in some new form. When I saw Nichols's close-up on their held hands in the final shot, I realized that what I was seeing was still very much a love story...free of easy cynicism on the one hand or easy sentimentalism on the other hand, and instead ending with a very fragile, hard-earned sense of hope.",1213833600,,3358,4.877408056042031

1195592,5,B000006FKX,"Yes People. I finally arrived to my castle in Scotland. Somewhere in Rhodes- but don't ask the address. It is reserved for only special people. Not that I am denying that you all aren't special. But, being inundated with tons of special requests is terribly hard -even for a reknown Seer (like myself!). I've had the chance to relax and watch a few videos that would relax my tired brain synapses. And I picked this one! I must have been crazy! But, not unlike the characters in this movie, believe me. Anyway, I have branched out to movie reviews and, after all, it is an art form like music- only more visual than audible. Needless to say-your Metamorpho has been well-versed in all the inner soul machinations. Thus, I take my crafty hand at reviewing this considerable movie.
I have been quite taken with it since it explores the human psychology in many vast and revealing ways. I seek answers. Why do people act the way they do? Certainly, we can all take behavior on a surface level only. But there is much, much more.
But first - let's talk about the acting here. It is perfect casting. Elizabeth Taylor has, absolutely, without a doubt, given one of the finest performances on screen ever. And, Richard Burton, is not far behind. With George Segal and Sandy Dennis completing the cast, it is about as perfect as it can be. Superb!
However, you must have alot of energy to view it because it will drain you. Why? Because the characters, George and Martha, who it seems are constantly at war, will exhaust you beyond your limitations. It is distasteful. It is crude. And, as your Metamorpho will testify, there really are people out there exactly like this.
There are many themes on display here. And, just like that miraculous onion universe - there are layers upon layers of revelations to discover.  For the most part-on the surface - is the question of reality and truth. And how people make contracts to perserve their illusions to  avoid reality.
It also makes the big statement of how we all hurt each other because of that illusion. How the illusion must be protected at all costs.  .
But, in all this, it is revealing. It is a mirror to ourselves and begs us to answer within; how much of this are we complicit with? It is an examination- but also, an unveiling. And, those with introspection would be amazed at all the wealth that this movie contains.
I cannot reveal all the inner workings and levels that are within this  movie. And, Edward Albee (the writer) has invented lines of sheer genius that, if you blink, and your ears don't hear for a second, you will miss entirely. So, BE AWARE my public!
The plot is so complicated that all I will give you is the scenario. George (Richard Burton) is an associate professor at a college. Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is his wife and the daughter of the head of the college. They have constructed an illusion of having a son to make life more acceptable. But, this is a fantasy only between the two of them. And their bitterness surfaces at inopportune times. When Nick (George Segal) who is a new teacher of Biology and Honey (Sandy Dennis) are invited over after a college social gathering, the tension between George and Martha really starts to escalate. Why? Because the ""pact"" between George and Martha was broken because Martha spoke of their son to Honey.  Information is gathered about the couple, then George and Martha include them in their illusion, turning Nick and Honey into victims as well.  Understand, there are so many themes here and so many aspects to view this movie. The more you watch, the more layers of insight you are able to decipher.
In my mind, Edward Albee has created a masterpiece with this and should definitely be watched by those who seek to avoid illusion in their lives  and those who need a mirror into their own lives. Absolutely superb. A dialogue and introspective movie which rates with the greatest.
I realize I have only touched on a very small part of this movie. But that only begs further examination on your part. Illusions are barriers, walls, if you will, to breaking through to reality and discovering your genuine own happiness in the world. But, like any other barriers in our lives, you can break them down and find a whole new world or richness within yourselves. That old adage is true. There definitely is a thin line between love and hate.
That is it for now. Your Seer always strives for true happiness in his life. This is a sacred right for me and everyone. Don't let anyone stand in your way for this quest because it is one of the very most important things in your lives. These characters deserve your understanding rather than derision. After all, it could be you.
Thank-you for listening. Now I am off to change the light bulbs in my library. I am currently reading a book and using only full moonlight doesn't cut it anymore. Wait! Is that Elizabeth Taylor on a broomstick, streaking across the sky? Or is it--illusion?

1195593,5,B000006FKX,"Edward Albee's vituperative play about marital warfare, an acknowledged classic even during its first run, came to the screen with searing fervor by an unlikely combination of talents at that time - stage director Mike Nichols helming his first film, screenwriter Ernest Lehman coming off the big box office treacle of ""The Sound of Music"", and two mega-stars who were more famous as notorious tabloid-saturated lovers than as character actors. The highly successful 1966 adaptation of the Broadway hit was considered quite daring because of its frank portrayal of a sadomasochistic marriage and the frequent use of profanity throughout. The groundbreaking film also signaled the end of the Hayes Code, which held a censorship stranglehold over Hollywood productions since 1934. Now in a new 2006 two-disc DVD set, the movie seems marginally tamer now, but the lacerating wit of Albee's fearless dialogue and the powerful performances still make this a great picture albeit not a joyous one.

The simple-sounding story focuses on the aptly named George and Martha, a middle-aged associate history professor and his older, shrewish wife. Staggering home after an alcohol-fueled faculty party, they trade their usual barbs and then are joined by Nick, a young assistant biology professor, and his wife Honey, whom a drunken Martha had invited over for a late-night nightcap. Despite the late hour, Nick readily accepts the invitation since Martha's father is the university president. What ensues is a series of vitriolic cat-and-mouse scenes of tension and black comedy among the four principals. In fact, there is no one else in the movie other than a roadside caf owner and a waitress in the background. Delusions and deceptions contaminate the often nasty comments, and the conversations strip away the characters' self-protective veneers. With his debut film, Nichols manages to open up the story with scenes in the front yard and at the caf, but he maintains the claustrophobic atmosphere necessary for the primal instincts to ignite and fester among the quartet.

Haskell Wexler's textured black-and-white cinematography and Sam O'Steen's edgy editing add immeasurably to the often harrowing proceedings. However, what remains most memorable is the fine cast guided by Nichols. Even though Elizabeth Taylor is nearly two decades too young to play the 52-year old Martha, she throws herself into the harridan with abandon. Overweight with a gray wig and bosom-heaving outfits, Taylor makes Martha flamboyantly vulgar and sadly pitiable at the same time. It's her best movie work by miles. Richard Burton is more ideally cast as George, who begins as a despondent, beaten-upon husband but soon matches his wife's emotional blackmail ploys with cyclonic force. Out of a dozen professional attempts, this is the only time Taylor and Burton seem to justify the intrigue of their off-screen exploits. In her first major role, Sandy Dennis is impressive as the fragile Honey liberating herself with alcohol. Perhaps because Nick is the least developed role, George Segal comes off as the most pallid of the foursome.

The print is clean and nicely presented in a letterbox format. The DVD extras start out strong with two alternate commentary tracks - the first a newly recorded one with Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh, the second with Wexler that was recorded for the Laserdisc release several years ago. Nichols and Wexler both provide invaluable insights into the production, while Soderbergh seems rather superfluous with his fan reactions to the movie. The second disc has two new featurettes - the twenty-minute ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: A Daring Work of Raw Excellence"", which discusses the production in retrospect, and the ten-minute ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Too Shocking for Its Time"" about the censorship problems around the film and how it kick-started the rating system still in use today.

Also on the second disc are two archival pieces of lesser interest - an eight-minute 1966 interview with Nichols on NBC's ""Today Show"", which shows the filmmaker as less than illuminating at this point in his career, and a superficial 1975 TV special called ""Elizabeth Taylor: An Intimate Portrait"". Hosted by a meandering Peter Lawford, the latter program has interviews with Rock Hudson, directors Vincente Minnelli and Richard Brooks and even Taylor's American mother Sara but no involvement from Taylor herself, who is seen only in archival footage. Of more interest is footage from Dennis's screen test opposite Roddy McDowall, showing the actress already well prepared for her complex role. There are four trailers included for the films included in the newly released Taylor-Burton DVD set, of which the ""Woolf"" trailer is surprisingly the weakest. The others in the collection are 1963's ""The VIPs"", 1965's ""The Sandpiper"" and 1967's ""The Comedians"".",1166313600,,4885,5.315653298835705

1195615,1,B000006FKX,"I was appalled, but not surprised, to find that this Warner Bros DVD was almost inaudible when I played it. It's got the same truly dumb Dolby Digital (only - no PCM) audio set up as for ""Blow Up"" and ""Death In Venice"". They all offer ""1.0"" ONLY - and even then it's at about one fifth the volume it needed to be.

I cannot believe that Warner Bros didn't see the clear logic that even a mono film should be encoded as 2.0 at the very least, but having the volume so low is not only totally inept - it shows complete disregard for the consumer. It is necessary that the volume of DVD's be relatively uniform - otherwise pressing ""stop"" while playing this DVD on your DVR (with inbuilt tuner) might just see your expensive speakers die in one almighty blast of whatever televison channel it was tuned to.

A good example of how a mono soundtrack can be used to best advantage on DVD in Dolby Digital is ""A Night To Remember"" - which makes effective use of both front and centre speakers (in 3.0). Many people these days will be hearing their DVD's through surround sound systems - so why on earth would anyone design sound to come from the center speaker only?

I've no doubt that this is a great film - but my ability to enjoy it in this particular DVD format has been hugely discounted. Warner Bros deserve a good slap.",1165449600,,1320,4.314516129032258

1195617,2,B000006FKX,"Think of this as the touring company of the original production, and they just happened to have a camera on-hand.  Elizabeth Taylor catches some of the outlines of Uta Hagen's original performance, but only crudely, and without the sense of a desperate, vulnerable creature beneath all of the crude bluster.  And just gaining weight and donning a fright wig do not a performance make.  As George, Richard Burton bring a more serious talent to bear on the character, but he seems to share playwright Edward Albee's illusion that George is a sensitive, superior creature telling necessary truths, instead of a vicious weakling who strikes at other's vulnerabilities as a way to stifle his feelings of self-loathing and failure.  As Nick, a smart fellow who may actually has something of value beneath his empty charm and predatory nature, George Segal is pleasant but suggests none of the intellect that would make him a college professor or the coldness that would make him the user that the script insists he is.  Worst of all is Sandy Dennis as Honey.  Melinda Dillon's peformance in the original Brodaway production was a small miracle, as a woman of substance emerges from beneath a soft and giggly exterior.  Dennis just plays the surface, and plays it badly; shrieking and blubbering and generally getting on your nerves.  You would never know from this performance that she was in fact a charming and gifted actress in films far less competent than this one.

The competence was guaranteed by Mike Nichols, who had made a name for himself as both a performer of original comedy with Elaine May and as a skillful director of other's comedies, from an off-Broadway production of THE KNACK (where he first worked with George Segal, who played the lady-killer Tolan) to the early plays of Neil Simon.  His directorial debut shows that he had a good grasp of cinematic technique and vocabulary, but also that he had a tendency to use it glibly; the film is full of visual echoes of more serious directors, but recycled as shock tactics and quick grabs for stylishness.  This glibness infects Haskell Wexler's photography, which goes for pockmarks on actor's faces and flashy lighting effects.  The script, by Ernest Lehman, is mostly a matter of rearranging a few scenes to allow for exteriors and blue-pencilling a few of the rawer profanities in the Edward Albee original.  What's lacking is the sense in the original that something profound is happening before our eyes--that sense may have been illusory, but as the original-cast recording on Caedmon Records (now out of print, alas) makes clear, the right production was full of it.  This smooth, compromised film never achieves a whisper of it",1149897600,,2700,4.957871396895787
1195618,5,B000006FKX,"Elizabeth Taylor's Martha is a collage of luminosity and steely-knived heartbreak.  With her gorgeous face and a past filled with easy-crowd pleasers, Ms. Taylor is typically remembered as a moviestar rather than an actress, but Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf clearly disproves that notion.  She's a volatile bundle of wicked nerves and pain.  I've never seen her so alive.  Richard Burton, as her beaten-down and cold husband, is equally good, and the two of them rip up the scenery and in the process of devouring one another, tear their young visitors in two.  It's impossible not to be drawn into their game.

An adaptation from the controversial[Albert Finney?]play that leaves the viewer in a melancholy and somber mood. The pervasive despair,deep cynisism, and yearning for choices not made(or made poorly) that this middle-aged married couple exudes slowly poisons and cheapens the innocence and naivetie of a young newlywed couple. The film takes place within a single evening and morning. Drinking like you have never seen with,of course,an equal amount of smoking. Brilliant cast of Richard Burton,Liz Taylor,George Segal,and Sanndy Dennis. A very deep and disturbing drama focusing on the bizarre relationship of a washed-up Assistant Professor and his ambitious,yet resigned, shrew of a wife.

With the character of Martha, Taylor was able to break free from the shackles of her ethereal beauty and persona and scorch onto celluloid, one of the most memorable characters in American Theatre.  First time movie director Mike Nichols coaxed career best performances out of Taylor and husband Richard Burton while staying true to Albee's theatrical grand slam.  The film caused considerable controversy at the time for its foul language and caustic subject matter, helping to abolish the constrictive Hays Code in favour of today's rating system for films.  History aside, Edward Albee's attack on marriage in America, (George and Martha - Washington), still packs a punch today.  The film is told in real time (from 2:00 am until dawn).  As the night wears on, social grace gives way to all out warfare as the characters  slash away at each other until they are forced to face the very core of who they are. Sandy Dennis and George Segal hold their own against the battling Burtons but it's Taylor's triumph.  This classic drama is a must.",1131667200,,1191,5.01015228426396

Virginia Wolff is an incredibly unpleasant movie about the most frightening married couple anyone will ever see, hopefully, but is acted so artfully that it fully deserves all the Oscars it won. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton spit searing verbal venom at each other from the first frames of the movie, but it only gets hotter from there. A must-see for any fan of either actor, or someone in the mood for a fascinating, dark masterful movie.

It's an extrememly well done version of the play about a married couple who has an extremely vicious argument for the entirety of the film. All four credited actors in the movie receive Oscar nominations and for good reason. Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis all give fantastic performances. Taylor and Burton are the drunk, argumentative couple who were actually married at the time of the film. Taylor is the daughter of the president of a small college and Burton is a history teacher. Very late at night after a faculty party a couple has been invited over to their house by Taylor unbeknownst to Burton who would prefer to sleep. The husband is a young biology teacher at the college and the woman is his rich young wife. They are all extremely drunk and over the course of the party all of their very personal secrets come out quite embarrasingly in a series of elaborate and ridiculous games. It is a great film about human nature.",1123718400,,1142,4.575609756097561
1195638,5,B000006FKX,"It would be a dull mind indeed that would respond to this film with anything but respect, awe, and terror.  Unlike many ""classics"" that the AFI has rated as Tried and True, most of which are dry as bone and lacking any relevance to the present time, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" explores, through the lens of a demented union between a man and a woman locked in psychical mortal combat, questions (truth/illusion, unhappiness, et al) that will never leave the human mind untouched.

Performances on the part of Burton and Taylor are nothing less than bone chilling.  George and Martha are aging members of a prestigious, unnamed University: George is a History teacher, and Martha is the daughter of the University's dean. A true monster of a human being, she takes a inexplicable delight in tearing George to pieces, reducing him to the sum of his failures with her shrill, bratty voice.  George does not suffer quietly for long, as we sense he has been doing for years as the film opens.  His razor sharp tongue and amusing capacity for exposing Martha for what she really is--a spoiled drunk with a lot of undeserved pull--is drop dead funny at times, and ruthless at others.  Ultimately George wins because of his thoughtful, literate nature: Martha's brutality, which is considerable, is finally conquered by his decision to take it all the way, strip all the illusions ""right down to the bone"".

George is no saint, however; he is built on many of the same  animalistic impulses that Martha is, only we detect a shred of something human in him as the nightmarish evening rolls on.

Two guests arive late in the night, and almost immediately things go from 0-60.  The moment that the ""tall, well built"" Nick (George Segal) opens the door, Martha yells ""goddamn you!"" to George.  For a moment the camera fixes on the young man's eyes, as the beginnings of realization take hold that he is walking into a borderline-psychotic household.  His wife, a secretly mentally ill, delicate, and (as it turns out, victimized) young woman, is the one who suffers the most from the ""night of fun and games with George and Martha"".

More than George or Martha, I found Nick the most repulsive character.  Amidst the madness and the unbelievably vicious psychological games that Martha and George inflict on each other, more out of need than irritation, he keeps his mind on his career as a professor.  The constantly flowing alcohol fuels the madness, as all of the very nasty warts George and Martha have fermented over the miserable years are exposed. The mystery of this film is that despite absolute mayhem of their relations, George and Martha are held together by something that seems real.

In the hopeless night that Martha and George inhabit, the question of whether truth even exists is raised not out of any academic intellectuality, but out of the overwhelming pain and bitterness of their lies.  The ending implies that while they may seem fearless indulging their pathos;they do fear the direction in which they are headed: absolute insanity.

The atmosphere can only be classified as horror coupled with black humor.  You feel like you are actually there.

It is far, far better than ""Citizen Kane"", leaves ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in the dust, and, above all, makes one wonder what Richard Burton could have done with his extraordinary talent if he could have let the booze alone and stopped getting involved in failed marriages and ridiculous movies.  Burton as George, the bookish, alcoholic husband of Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), is as sadly fitting a role in the personal sense as Rock Hudson's in ""Seconds"".  Burton was often known to say ""Wherever the books are, home is"" and had extreme potential.

I'm not afraid of Virginia Woolf, but I am afraid that this is a very boring play. It is dull, long-drawn out, repetitive and wholly unedifying. Marriages aren't like this any more, if they ever were, although they might have been in the early 60s. The people are completely unbelievable, quite unreal. The production is extremely stagy, contrived, mechanical and clunky, although it's obvious that a lot of work went into it. I never saw what was supposed to be so fantastic about Elizabeth Taylor, who seems to me a plain and dumpy little person and a mediocre actress --- at best. The dialogue lacks wit and imagination: four very ordinary academics get drunk and irritate each other, and the audience. They display nothing of their assumed erudition in history and biology; in fact, they might as well have been high-school teachers, or management accountants. There is no plot, and very little character development. A sensation in 1966, merely numbing forty years on. Watch it once if you must (I thought I was going to see something remarkable) and then consign it to historic oblivion, along with Proust, Henry James and the rest of the tedious crew.",1118620800,,1277,4.835616438356165
1195641,5,B000006FKX,"After a party a college professor, George (played by Richard Burton"" learns that his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invited a young couple over to their home for a nightcap. The young couple  (played by Sandy Dennis and George Segal) are new to the college, Segal's character having just having received an appointment there.

The new comers are in for an evening that they (and the viewer) will never forget.

George has been a professor at the college for years - a disappointment to his wife and his father in-law the president of the college he is over the hill and feeling his age. His wife Martha is loud, promiscuous and an alcoholic.

And so when the young couple finally arrive the games begin.

Straight off Martha and George trade witty banter and insults while their guests look on as if they stepped into some theatre of the absurd.

As insults and liquor  continue to flow George and Martha draw their guests into their rough games.

Masters of mind control of  the North during the Korean War have nothing on George and Martha as secrets are revealed and emotion is stripped to the bare bone.

The story takes place over an evening  but it seems like a life time.

Burton and Taylor are brilliant in this  emotionally violent movie.

Although it is rough it is entertaining, sometimes profound and sometimes very very  funny.

Highly recommended.

1195642,3,B000006FKX,"People rave about this movie -- and I had thought it would live to its reputation before I saw it -- but it just isn't convincing. Each of the four protagonists oscillates between being outrageous and borderline psychopatic, and being a normal person the next instant, then going back to crazy again. The older man, for instance, would insult his wife and bring her dirty laundry out in a particularly mean way, but when a minute later she does the same, he acts shocked that anyone could behave that way. Same goes for her, and in fact the other two as well, as the viewer is meant to be shocked by the outrageous person, then feeling emphatic for the normal person. And those reversals happen at the rate of one a minute.

Real people aren't that way, which makes this drama, while fairly interesting in itself, lose lots of its appeal -- it doesn't teach anything about the real world but about some imagined one where people's pshyches work in a different way.

And not to forget that each of those four drinks maybe 10+ glasses of hard liquor in a short time -- and they were drunk before their fateful encounter to begin with. That doesn't make the intellectual exchange among them any more believable.",1114732800,,1208,4.587962962962963

This play and film will most likely be the zenith, the Signature Play of Edward Albee's tremendous career, though he has written much since the Broadway production of this play in the early 1960's.
Though, at the time it was thought of as mostly a way to cash in on their major stardom, the casting of Taylor and Burton is perfect: as each of them reaches way above and sometimes below the surface of the written page to come up with the truth and heart of Albee's words (though Nichols and Ernest Lehman adapted the screenplay).
Albee is concerned here with the little and big lies we tell ourselves and others in order to keep going: ""Truth or Illusion,"" George and Martha intone several times during this film (""Truth or Illusion, George, doesn't it matter to you...at all?""). And only when George ""kills"" the Illusion of an imaginary son do we feel that there is any chance for George and Martha to continue:
  Martha...""before I'm through with you you'll wish you'd died in that automobile
  [...]  George:...""and you'll wish you'd never mentioned our son!""

Albee has set ""WAOVW"" in New Carthage, which was founded in the 9th Century B.C. The Romans razed it to the ground in 146 A.D. By the 5th Century it had again become a power, which St Augustine, in his ""Confessions"" called a ""Cauldron of Unholy Loves.""

For best results, invite your best friends over, sit up with a pot of coffee, and start viewing this around 2 a.m.  Two hours later, when it's all over, the exhaustion of the late night will coincide so cathartically with George and Martha's final exorcism that you will have experienced your own encounter with The Void.

The film is an adaptation of Edward Albee's play about a university couple whose relationship is so complex, upon first look, it appears they cannot bear each other.  But look closer - much closer.  While they seem to have a horrible way of helping each other survive (and believe me, that is what, at least HALF of this is about) they indeed do each other a service by punishing each other for whatever it is each of them feel guilty about.

But this is a psychological thriller at its best.  The diaglogue is crisp, biting, caustic, strange, compelling, honest, brutal and thoroughly engrossing.  It is disturbing and not for the faint-hearted but is a fascinating look in the dark recesses that make up some relationships.  It also demands that you pay close attention to the dialogue because this is where you truly find out exactly what this entails.

The simple plot deals with two university couples, one young, one not-so-young, who ""entertain"" each other in the wee hours of the night after a university party.  George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invite a young couple over who just joined the university staff.  While George and Martha are old hats at this ""banter"" they have developed, they draw the young couple into their pyschological tortue chanber resulting in a riveting but exhausting evening of fun and games. Even by today's standards, this is truly an intricate, disturbing, but thoroughly enjoyable look at what drives some relationships.

Oscars went to the women but not the men! Hmmmmmmmmmmm.
An even more interesting bit of trivia is that Bette Davis wanted to play this part badly but eventually lost out to Liz.

If you agree with this , I would say that Mike Nichols has had a clear influence in his first stage of his brilliant career of Ingmar Bergman. Think for instance in three excellent future films of Nichols (Four easy pieces , Carnal knowledge and Black widow)
This long introduction is necessary for understand the weird presence of a dark and even bitter film like Who's afraid...
The film undoubtly has deep roots related with two important films of the swedish director like The silence and The hour of the wolf.
This comment doesn't deserve a bit about the great level of this magnificent picture.
First at all, watch for the resource economy . The film runs at night hours and with two locations .
Two very different couples, one of them extremely young almost teenagers , and in the other side a midle aged marriage. He's a patetic man , extremely weak character (Richard Burton) and she is the unsatisfied woman , and domains the relationship in every little detail.
The meeting with this young couple will allow to Elizabeth Taylor exhibit her monumental skills for acting and give a tour de force performance , that became in her well deserved Second Academy Award.
The script is extraordinary. The dialogues are pregnant of crude realism , the horror, the multiple facets of a woman who has kept in silence so many dissapointments , the countless consequences as result of a poor comunication , the anguish of her about knowing and being the axis of the relationship.
And this is the ocassion for her to eject her most hidden thoughts ; she exploits like a earthquake , literally without a drop of prudence with all the violence that you can imagine and even more , the past phantoms emerge from the deepest dark shadows of her soul .
The hopeless, the loneliness , the sense of going nowhere and however not be able to separate instead the inferno in which she lives.
All this micro universe exploits before us and you feel its impact and the tragedy.
That film is a challenge for any director in any age, but Nichols is a master who besides had the presence of these two  giants actors as Taylor and Burton. The house and the garden are the silent background in which this disgraced marriage reveals its intimacies before the young marriage.

Martha's and George's relationship is that of a long married couple who have grown weary of each other. Yet they cannot leave each other, it's the only life they know.

The fights and arguments are, at the end of the day, worth the trouble of keeping your identity, your everyday life, your grasp of reality.
The cast, all four of them, are meticulous in their performances. They complete each others presence, nurture the rivalry, fill the gaps and most importantly-delivers to the maximum of their potential.
Watching this is more like seeing it performed on stage than in a theatre or on your TV in your home. Early on, you get the feeling all is not well between George & Martha, and as the guests arrive, the story is just about
to begin. The presence of the characters adds to the overall authenticicty of the story and the parts they play. It's a clichee, but I know many plays of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" has been set up: none can match the original.

It's not enough for George and Martha to ridicule and torture each other with their abrasive dialogue; they drag the young, nave-looking couple into it, resulting in a powerful climax. The entire film takes place over a couple of hours on that one night, so concentrated that it's hard to absorb all that is said or implied between the characters.

1195686,4,B000006FKX,"'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' is that rare thing; a movie adaptation of a stage play where we know, ever without having to be told, that it originated on the stage. It is a completely character-driven piece, full of intense dialogue, isolation & repression, and a sense of desolation and sadness that not even the most accomplished contemporary movies can match.
George and Martha (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) are having newly-employed University colleague Nick (George Segal) and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) back for late-night drinks, after a faculty party. While there, the hapless young couple stumble upon the web of lies and psychological abuse that passes for a marriage between George and Martha, and through a process of drinking, seduction and cruelty, leave with their own young marriage in tatters.
It is simply not possible to make tangible exactly how absorbing Taylor and Burton are in this picture. Certainly Burton's finest hour, he plays the part of the henpecked, abused George with brilliant depth and pathos, and ranges from abusee to abuser with such believable energy and commitment that we dare not look away. The same can be said of Taylor; this film is her absolute finest hour, and in the character of the ugly, foulmouthed Martha she takes the viewer by the throat and keeps us close to her for the whole film. Hers is a character on a par with Bette Davis in Baby Jane, a monstrous bundle of complex neuroses that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, but far more human and believable than Jane, Martha creates fear because she could so easily be real.
Sanders and Dennis are also excellent as the unlucky young couple forced to re-evaluate their own marriage. Although Dennis won an Oscar for her portrayal as Honey, Sanders gives a hugely noteworhty performance as Nick, the ayrean hero subverted by the sickness of George and Martha's situation.
In such a piece, direction is never required to be more than competent, and while the typcial Hollywood decision to have three different locations for the movie will cause some chagrin to fans of the stage play, the rest of the direction is done in the true noir-style. Camerawork is unobtrusive and lighting is used sparingly, to create an atmosphere as emotionally detached as it is devastating.
'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' is not a happy movie. It is the antithesis of the feel-good flick, to the point where you may feel some initial dislike for it. However it affects you, and it will, you cannot help but feel awestruck by the magnificence of the performances or the amount of emotion generated by the leads. A true example of the power of fine acting, 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is an absolute must-have addition to anyone's collection.",1074470400,,2765,4.910256410256411

And Elizabeth Taylor plays her to perfection.
This is the movie about a middle aged couple (Liz and Richard Burtain)  who love to play strange games.  They thrive on it. They delight in it. Their marriage appears to be based on it.
But one night when they have a young couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over for a few cocktails, their little Phychological games get a little dangerous, outrageous, sexually kinky.
I found myself gasping at times, because I could not belive what was unfolding before my eyes...Martha and George find the weakness in people and then begin tearing them apart (Little by Little) until nothing is left. Words can be like razors and cut, cut, cut.  And they do this exceptionally well.
 The venom rushes out of their pink mouths as if they are creating a web and then there is no stopping them ....Even sleeping with their sweet, young guests is not out of the question.
Martha and Goerge are dysfunction at the highest level, but the writing and acting is so excellent that the audience will feel for them, want to see them redeem themselves, and hope that their marriage will work.
Stunning performances by Burtain,Taylor, Dennis, and Segal...But Taylor shines beyond words.",1074297600,,1352,4.890829694323144

No.  This is a dark and disturbing picture of what a marraige can turn into when you let everything spiral downwards and yet it's more complex than that (it definitely feels more like a play than a movie).  The funny thing for me was that no matter how horrible Elizabeth Taylor's character, no matter how drunk, rude, and braying she was, and despite the fact she was looking older, I could still only look at her and admire how stunningly beautiful she was.  I'll admit this film had some merit, but I never want to see it again.  I rank it in the same category as Vertigo and possibly The Country Wife - masterful yet too disturbing to want to watch over and over (although I would like to see Country Wife again if it ever comes out on DVD).

Burton and Taylor are simply marvelous in their roles as two seriously disturbed people who have been married for...much too long. Taylor won an Academy Award and Burton should have won (no disrespect towards Paul Scofield for A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS). Edward Albee's brilliant characters and writing is simply breath-taking. That is if you can take 2 1/2 hours of absorbing drama about four miserable people (George Segal and Sandy Dennis are also excellent as the guests). It is true that a film like this isn't for everyone. The negative reviewers concern themselves with the mood of the film...why would anyone want to watch 4 people yelling at each for over 2 hours...but that isn't a review, and people expecting a Disney version of Albee's play shouldn't be watching it in the first place. Real life isn't easy to watch. Albee's story about an alcoholic professor and his over-bearing alcoholic wife is not easy to watch. Instead, the viewer must watch the film as life-like art, and an example for all filmmakers to follow. Director Mike Nichols had it filmed in black and white (Haskell Wexler), and most of the original play (screenplay by Ernest Lehman) remained intact. In a day when your average movie-going experience involves empty-headed entertainment (Matrix, X-men, Hulk, American Pie, Dumb and Dumberer, etc. - you know what I mean), WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, even if you need to be in the mood to watch it, is far easier to take in the long run.",1056067200,,1604,4.815217391304348

It starts out with ascerbic wit and dark humour and goes on to become filled with unexpected turns from the cast, and cruelty and violence of the mind.
George (Richard Burton) is a washed out history professor, with a sardonic but quiet manner, and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is a slovenly, alcoholic with a permanently vicious tongue.
They invite Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) to late night drinks at their home, where the older couple tear each other to pieces, drawing the innocent younger couple into their warped and vicious mind-games with large quantities of alcohol for all, to help the destructive process along.
The dialogue draws from hilarious humour, such as where George refers to Martha's University Dean father as having `beady red eyes', and where quiet and sweet Honey becomes drunk and for the first time, vocal , to scenes of horror , such as where George becomes more vicious than his wife.
While Martha certainly brought this on herself, it is with a sense of disgust that we see him turn unprovoked on Honey, who he tears to shreds- a classic case of the depraved savaging the innocent.
The story draws on to reveal through various twists and turns to reveal just how depraved the older couple are, while one wonders why the younger couple stay on at their house....",1050969600,,1463,4.809523809523809

Also I love the language of thsi film, the acting and the constant push of characters playing a game within a game.  The art of the work is the language and timing.  I'm not sure if some things can ever be resatged or refilmed with other actors because what also makes this work is the baggae of Taylor and Burton together.  This isn't simply a work aside from actor, this is a farscape view into what these people may or may not have felt inklings of for each other.
George Segal and Sandy Dennis are great here too as unwitting pawns and weapons in the war between George and Martha, though Dennis is used more as a pawn who may or may not understand her position and Segal gets a chance to skewer and attack back.
I love the language and written heart of this woprk in particular for one reason.  It goes for the jugular, to slit a vein open in this amazingly dysfunctional lifestyle and couple.  Black and white only highlights the starkness of their feeling for each other and lovign hatred.  They remind me of Nick and Jessica in twenty years.

Together, Taylor and Burton subject two young neighbors, played stunningly by George Segal and Sandy Dennis, to a night of hell where the line between reality and vicious fantasy of cruel mind games isn't clearly drawn. Taylor, in a class all her own in this one, earned a second Oscar for her tour de force while looking every bit the deglamorized unfulfilled shell of a beauty goddess Martha undoubtedly was. Burton is as compelling in his viciousness that is George's life blood. He was Oscar-nominated as were Segal and Dennis with the latter winning Best Supporting Actress. Shot in black and white and centered in Martha and George's hell house, the intensity of the sense of being penned and the desire to run are urgent and, in the end, we leave George and Martha with a sigh of relief, hoping neverto return and a sense of pity for these two battered souls who, for whatever reason, gave up on life in favor of mutually assured destruction. Taylor is awesome: her performance her may well be the single best ever in cinematic history.",1041292800,,1330,4.889380530973451
1195695,5,B000006FKX,"Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor do a superb job transferring this classic stage production to the silver screen. I'm sure Edward Albee would be pleased. The utter turmoil between George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor), and the fact that the majority of the film takes place in a small parlor, gives the viewer a feeling of claustrophobia and discomfort. Only two superior actors could pull it off.
The conflict between the two begins with the opening credits and increases in its ferocity through out the picture, finally culminating in the final reveling scene.
While reading the reviews, I was surprised to find very few comments on this very important last scene...where we discover the truth behind the mysterious son of Martha and George. This is the root cause of some of the most savage dialogue in the film, and should not be taken lightly.
This movie is certainly worth purchasing as it can be seen a number of times, and only increases in its profundity. It gets better and better with each viewing.",1036281600,,1010,4.877906976744186
1195696,5,B000006FKX,"I consider this one of the most intelligently written and acted movies ever filmed. The psychological devestation that George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor)inflict upon each other casts a spell which, though it at times makes the viewer uncomfortable in its realism, is impossible to turn away from. George Segal and Sandy Dennis are the unfortunate co-passengers on this mad ride to ""truth"". Though they are not stupid, they are naieve and inexperienced to the point of seeming arrested development, and  George and Martha go in for the kill. This is the film where Elizabeth Taylor shattered her glamour image, a pretty brave thing to do at that time, and it worked. Though her beauty was always obvious, I was never a big fan of many of her film roles, until I saw this film. It is not only her best performance, but I consider it in the ranks of the top female performances ever filmed, and Richard Burton is equally superb. That they were able to play so well off of each other in spite of, or maybe because of, their personal off-screen relationship, is amazing. Movies that do not insult the intelligence are rare these days,... I guess most of todays paying movie audience wants glorified ear-splitting music videos, with the plot secondary, if considered at all. This film is a perfect example of the mostly forgotten noble intention of the medium, which was ,yes, to entertain, but aspired to craft an experience that would also move you, make you think, and, stand in awe struck appreciation of REAL talent.",1032739200,,1516,4.8084291187739465

All those revolting emotions are here: envy, bitterness, shallowness, gratuitous nastiness, the sick delight in hurting others' feelings. Yes, it's a brilliant movie. And like an aggressive drunk at full speed, it goes on and on and on. It made me feel very pleased with myself that I don't like alcohol.

1195698,5,B000006FKX,"Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is one of the most important plays in the history of American Drama, representing a sort of merging of the psychological drama represented by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller with the existential plays of Samuel Becket and Eugene Ionesco.  After a faculty party George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) have invited a young professor, Nick (George Segal) and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis), back for a few drinks.  What happens is ironically described as fun and games, which end up airing everyone's dirty laundry in a compelling death spiral of brutal confrontations.
All four players were nominated for Oscars, with both of the ladies winning in the finest ensemble performance since ""Long Day's Journey Into Night.""  Burton lost to Paul Schofield in ""A Man for All Seasons"" and Segal to Walter Matthau in ""The Fortune Cookie.""  Haskell Wexler also earned a richly deserved Oscar for Best Black-and-White Cinematography.  I think this is clearly Elizabeth Taylor's best film performance (Burton's too).  I remember someone asking Katharine Hepburn if she thought any other actress had ever shown a range comparable to herself and she mentioned Taylor.  It makes sense.  They have both done plays by William Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, and Albee.  Not even Meryl Streep can say that.
The film does have one major problem, which Albee himself has repeatedly pointed out, namely, it was a mistake director Mike Nichols to let the two couples leave the house and go to a roadhouse in the middle of Act II.  The play is a one set play, of course, and Albee consider the claustrophobia it produced part of its main effect.  By getting them away from the house, or even having George and Nick have their big talk from Act III out in the backyard, the idea that Nick and Honey are trapped with no way out.  But I think this is something that bothers people who have studied the play intimately more than fans of the cinema.
Most Romantic Lines: Yeah, right.  I think the nicest thing Martha says to George is ""You make me puke,"" and the most famous line from the play, ""What a dump,"" is taken from a Bette Davis movie (Yes, I know which one, but, no, I am not telling).
If you like ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" then check out these other films on AFI's list: #84 ""Double Indemnity"" and #48 ""Last Tango in Paris.""  Why?  They are also tales of twisted love.",1025654400,,2426,4.812048192771084

Here is Elizabeth Taylor at the height of her physical beauty, putting on a firght wig, and getting overweight to play -- no to overplay -- the boozy Martha to perfection. Richard Burton, the godfather of Anthony Hopkins and Russell Crowe, is the perfect foil to Taylor (or is he?) in this hall of mirrors, dark comedy. Ultimately it is a love story, with an oddly happy ending. Albee has shown himself to be our greatest working playright (Arthur Miller is still alive, and hasn't worked much lately). Compare this to Three Tall Women and we see an exploration of how the self can be broken into many people. Compare this to The Goat and we see how many people become incorporated into the self.",1025308800,,855,4.452229299363057
1195700,5,B000006FKX,"I was a little worried before seeing this movie, because I had read the play and absolutely loved it.  I was worried that the movie would be water-downed and butchered like ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" which was forced to have that ridiculous ending in where evil was punished.  Well, I was happy to find out that none of that took place in this film.  ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is a triumph.
The actors did a terrific job in playing their characters.  The play is such a masterpiece that these people had to do their best to make sure that they did their characters justice.  Of course the two that stand out the most are Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  Taylor was everything I had envisioned when reading the play, and did an outstanding job as Martha.  I was a little worried about Richard Burton at first because in the beginning he seemed so monotoned and stiff.  If you read the play, he is the most lively and bitter character in the play who pretty much runs the entire show.  Well, as the movie continued he proved to play an excellent George.  They couldn't had found a better person for the job.  The other two actors as the guests did a terrific job.
For it being such an old movie, it looks very good and clear.  And there is a widescreen version you can watch.  The sound is also good for being so old.  Sorry to say that there are no eye-popping special features, but believe me, you won't be missing them because this is such a great movie.
Congrats to Ernest Lehman, the person who wrote the screenplay, for keeping the movie true to the play and not giving into the pressure to make it appropriate.  No ""Streetcar"" repeat here.  It stays very similar to the play.  There are little differences, but nothing that dramatcially changes the story.  It starts and ends the same way.  I did like how the movie moves to different locations from time to time, but still stays similar to the story at the same time.  Mike Nichols did a very good job of directing as well.
I really enjoyed this movie, and it is one of my favorites.  If you haven't already, please read the play.  If you like the movie, you will love the play.

1195702,5,B000006FKX,"Of all the stage play adaptations that have been made this one is one of my top favorites. After many years it still holds up and has proven to be a stage and film classic. The story as many know concerns an old, alchoholic, and strange (to say the least) couple, Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) and George (Richard Burton) who invite a young couple over for a late night visit over drinks only to have the whole night become a nightmare, all orchestrated by Martha and George. The night changes all their lives forever. The adaptation of the play could not be better. It shows you how under certain circumstances the devil inside you can be unleashed. Martha and George take out their repressed feelings on their guests which in turn affects thier guests emotionally and along the way painful discoveries are made which are about themselves and who they are and about each other's personal lives. The dialogue is sardonic, witty at times, and by the standards of the time in which this movie came out it is daring and obscene at times. The characters are people  who you might very well know in real life and they are very well drawn out. This movie is mainly character exposition and study. And the direction expands the play but keeps the intimate feeling of the stage play and it is  directed with a kind of gritty realism in some parts. The black and white cinematography is great and it just enhances the mood and feeling of the movie. Had it been filmed in color i am not sure it would have had the complete impact it has. The acting is near flawless in this movie. Elizabeth Taylor deservedly won the oscar for her best performance. She exudes raw energy, vulnerability, rage and she is sardonic. She was laughed at when she said she would play the part. She had the last laugh. She dared to go dowdy and old for the part (in real life she was younger and slimer, here she is old and not eaxctly in great shape). Richard Burton shows repressed anger and sadness as George and he goes from showing it subtly to just screaming and acting it out( at one point he breaks a botttle of beer and nearly strangles someone to death). Sandy Dennis who won a best supporting actress oscar starts off as a mousy little woman to a woman who can barely control her emotions. George Segal's character is the only one who manages to maintain some sanity in this movie though he does go off the deep end at times too. He is righteous and a devil-may-care at once. This movie is an experience which will linger in your mind for a long time after and it requieres repeat viewings. This is a truely unique tour de force film experience.

Unfortunate for both Martha and George, she shares with Honey, their young guest, the most sacred and fantical part of their marriage - the baby.  She allowed someone else into their fantasy.  This was the beginning of the end of their illusions.  When George ""killed""  the baby, he infact, killed what was holding their marriage together... or did he?

I watched it for the first time last night because I knew Elizabeth Taylor was in it, and I've always been vaguely interested in her. Since then I have watched it another two times. Because I didn't quite understand it; because i realised how many metaphors and meanings and themes there are; and because it is an amazingly scripted, shot and acted movie.  It's one of those films that affects you, makes you think about it afterwards and completely takes over for a while. I don't get this often with films (this and the color purple), so it's quite a find. Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and the actress that played Honey all deserved oscars, with 'Nick' letting the movie down slightly in my opinion.
When I first saw this film, I was trying to keep up with the many meanings and themes, laughing hysterically at the sarcasm and wit (especially that of George) and was in awe of the fantastic acting. Not to mention trying to put the pieces together to get the full picture (which I still don't entirely have).
This should have been a book for it's complexities and metaphors and the strength of characters, and the way that it infects the mind. However, it is an amazing film, and I can't wait to read the play.

Burton utterly dominates the movie, though Taylor has the superior role and  wittier lines. The subtlety that Burton brings to the character of George  is mesmerizing to watch, he is alternately whipped and dominant, funny and  then full of pathos. A magnificent performance!
The interplay between  George and Martha is exquisite. As a purely dialogue-driven movie, the  acting must be superlative or interest will flag. There is no danger of  that, not only is the script brilliant but the acting supports the dialogue  at every turn.

Elizabeth Taylor(who gained weight & went out of her  way to appear much older to get this role) and Richard Burton give the best  performances of their careers.  Mike Nichols(The Graduate) does a wonderful  directing job.  This adaptation of Edward Albee's dark play is perfect.  There is not a wasted line in the entire film.  The language and subject  matter of this movie were quite controversial when this movie initially was  released(1966).  It is as intense and unsettling as sitting between your  favorite married couple as they have the worst argument you can imagine.  George Segal & Sandy Dennis are brilliant as the young couple who come  over to spend an evening with George & Martha(Burton & Taylor).  They unwittingly walk into the dreadful twilight years of what appears to  be one of the most disastrous marriages ever to grace the silver screen.  The wit, realism & nastiness of this film have to be seen to be  believed!  Segal & Dennis' characters are at the beginning of their  marriage when they meet George & Martha.  They will never be the same  after one night in the hell of those wicked hearts.  There is very dark  humor, intensely painful moments, as well as plentiful suspense and shock.

Purely a dialogue driven film, the writing is beyond  compare.  Dancing nicely between horrific, funny, and sad with great grace.  There are very few films able to bring both screen writing and acting  together at such a high level.  The ending is particularly satisfying with  big question marks pocking all the themes.",961113600,,481,4.851851851851852

The back and forth bickering between the married couples is hilarious - and the scene in the diner is an  absolute classic. The gags just keep coming one after another. Mel Brooks  couldn't have done it any better. Although it drags in spots, I would  definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a comedy with a lot  of laughs. It's right up there with ""There's Something About  Mary"" and ""American Pie"". You'll love it!",961027200,,542,4.652631578947369
1195714,5,B000006FKX,"While watching Mike Nichols' film, based on Edward Elby's play, one is overwhelmed by the talent of its stars, Richard Burton and his wife and lover at the time, Elizabeth Taylor. The film portrays the hatred between  an aging couple, that has grown tired of each other over the long years  they were together and amuse themselves by humiliating and torturing each  other. How far from the truth! In the 60s they were the hottest couple in  Hollywood! This indicates a remarkable talent! Great!",959644800,,494,4.845238095238095
1195715,5,B000006FKX,"This is one of cinemas ultimate emotional rollercoasters. It contains what are widely reputed as being the best screen performances of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor and I for one agree with this. This is due not only to  their talent and hard work but to the exceptional quality of the writing  and directing. Playwright Edward Albee makes George and Martha win our  sympathy. The picture shows a couple whose career and family aspirations  have been so frustrated that if they are not at each others throats, they  retreat into a fantasy world where they are raising a son. Some audiences  may find the relentless bantering and vindictiveness between the couple  excessive but this degree of intensity is true to the work. Of sure  interest from a psycholgical point of view are the dynamics between the two  couples who have gathered for  'drinks'. We see each members frailties and  heartaches and agony but also their capacity for ruthlessness. The picture  is a no holds barred exploration of the dark night of the soul. If you can  bear the deep anguish of the piece (it won't be everyone's cup of tea!) you  will witness some of the most honest and heartfelt writing and acting that  is ever likely to be captured on film.",958953600,,1235,4.759433962264151

They totally immerse themselves in their characters and the dialogue which is the  vehicle for deep character development.  This is another product of the  '60s blank hitting the societal fan.  Intense emotions are stirred during  the total psycho-war between George and Martha.  The title could very well  have been, Who's Afraid of Living Life in Reality with no Illusion.  I am  George, I am.  Very haunting atmosphere set in New England.  It says much  more than it's consciously aware of.  Leaps beyond anything in our mediocre  decade.",944870400,,667,5.046296296296297
1195737,5,B000006FKX,"While not everyone's cup of java, this picture, which is based on Edward Albee's awarded winning play is excellently acting by all concerned. The film received 5 academy awards, and  playwright Albee(who had no hand in  the film's making) was quite pleased with the outcome. The whole movie takes  place during a bizarre single night; George Segal and Sandy Dennis are the  young couple invited for drinks at George and Martha's home, and they are  in for quite a visit! Elizabeth Taylor's slovenly portrayal of Martha is a  modern classic while Burton gives a fine, modulated delineation of her  husband, George. From the very beginning of the film George and Martha have  made strange references to their son. Ultimately, we realize he is a  fabrication which was used as a weapon in their continuing battle with each  other; it is a night filled with truth and illusion. Taylor won the AA for  her playing of Martha and Sandy Dennis won the best supporting AA for her  easily sickened Honey.",944611200,,994,4.816568047337278

I have read the original play and it is funny, but Burton and Taylor  just steal the movie. I've seen most of the comments and they don't remark  on how hilarious I find the movie.

Masterful contributions from each contributor- actors,  cinematograhper, composer, set decorater- integrated into a seamless,  perfect whole by Mike Nichols. Taylor and Burton have never been better,  and I think Sandy Dennis is the only woman ever to co-star with Taylor and  win an Oscar.

1195742,5,B000006FKX,"When I first saw this film the language almost grossed me out but it made the film stronger. I was amazed at how Liz and Richard (husband number what...?) could actually stand each other and I wonder if their real-life  intolerance of one another fueled the momentum they put into their  perfomances. However, one may have to know who Virginia Woolf is in order  to fully understand the point of the film. I know I had to. She's an author  whose style of writing had a psychological effect on the reader. These  elements are brought out in the play and movie. Watch for the scene  involving the bitter truth about the couples' sixteen year old son. That  should clear up a few things. However, this film made me laugh, as it  reminded me of how my parents did nothing but fuss and fight and blast each  other down with raring insults and vile cussing. It was a laugh to see Liz  and Richard bicker at each other over little things. The music is also a  plus. It echoes throughout the film after there has been a severe eruption  of lost tempers and screaming fits. It seems to calm the viewer down and  prepare them for more gut-searing verbal wars that have yet to come. Don't  miss Sandy Dennis's drunken dance in the dance hall as she whirls around  totally gone in herself. She deserved her Oscar very much. This will no  doubt embed itself in your memory long after the final shot of the clasped  hands fades into total blackness. Don't miss this one!",923529600,,1456,4.454545454545454

7904418,4,B000006FKX,"I'm surmising that, in the stage version of this, they had just one set -- the lead protagonists' living room. Should have kept the movie in the living room. The roadhouse and backyard stuff was distracting and unnecessarily took away from the tension. Also, I found Taylor's and Burton's soliloquys ineffective. (I can't believe that Albee actually wrote those into the original play. I'll have to look into that.) And then there's Liz Taylor's makeup, which was sloppily applied and made her look older than need be. Another problem: Sandy Dennis won the best supporting actress Oscar for this unimpressive, lethargic perfomance. She definitely falls short of the mark. (Of course, this was a little early in her movie career. After this, she went on to do wonderful work in both drama [Up the Downstair's Case] and comedy [The Out of Towners].)",1525824000,,847,4.971830985915493

She says GD several times, if anyone cares about those sorts of things.  Depressing.  I knew it would be but it just wasn't interesting, either.  You really don't care what happens to these people, you're just glad you don't know them personally.  Watch Cat on a Hot Tin Roof instead!  Watch anything instead!

She is the daughter of the principal of a University and he is a failed Associate Professor. At least in her eyes. Their relationship has soured over the years to the point of disgust and she belittles him at every turn. One night a young Associate Professor and his wife visit unexpectedly and the story begins. The evening progresses along the lines of passive-aggressive mind games and ends with a total reversal of how it began. The characters are wonderful, of course, because of such superb acting by the four stars. I love many-layered plots and this movie doesn't disappoint. The one thing I didn't like about it is the subtle meaning of the last mind game. It took me some time to 'get it'. But maybe I am slow.",1523491200,,894,4.391566265060241
