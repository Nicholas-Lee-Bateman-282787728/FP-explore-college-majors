6601972,3,B00MUDYJ4I,"I'm buying this, although I would rather buy either a CD or download (only). I don't have a Blue-ray and I don't have $59.99 plus shipping to order the ""Special"", or let me re-phrase that, I don't want to spend the money on 1 title when I can buy 2 other releases also with $70. This format crap is getting ridiculous, and I wrote to THIS group after their ""Luna Park"" release on the subject.

 Release the DVD, Blue-Ray, CD, MP3 and Vinyl as separate items and us fans will either get a choice, or us die-hard fans will buy the title 2-3 times over. I dare anyone to disagree with me. This is so distracting that it really doesn't matter if the concert is good or not. When I get mine and watch it I will re-write a fair review of the content.

Improved the rating from 1 to 3 because they put it out on I-Tunes (finally). So far I've only listened to it, and there have been lot's of comments about the mix. Here's my attempt to start WW3: Vocals, drums and bass are way too low in the mix, all I hear is keyboards and the crowd, and the orchestra sounds like more keyboards. The guitar is audible but very thin in the spectrum of normally bombastic sound. If this was anyone else it would sound great, but for DT and by their standards of musical perfection it is a very poor overall representation. Most of us understand the concept of the board mix and how you have to mike the audience and layer it on top, how about releasing a ""crowdless"" soundtrack?",1410739200,7,1458,4.256317689530686

The playing, sound quality and time changes still blow me away. I love every piece except 'Space Dye Vest' which is OK but my least favorite - matter of taste. Check it out in HD on Youtube and you'll see. If you love it, buy it and pay these guys for their music. That's how they feed their family's.

This show happened the day before my birthday last year, and me and my core group of friends (friends for almost 30 years) pub crawled from North Station to the Opera House, just in time for the show and had a blast.  Great production values.

I will say this, James LaBrie seemed to like getting the cheap cheers by yelling ""All right Boston"" way to friggen much.  Love your voice James, but jeaze, did you have to yell that every five minutes?",1427846400,,495,4.406593406593407

6602010,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"I took a gamble on buying this after reading all the negative reviews about the sound. After watching it front to back I can say one thing for certain - don't believe all the people complaining about the sound. We have a Sony 5.1 Surround setup. The sound is wonderfully mixed, neglecting the lack of bass. You can still hear Mr. Myung, just not as much as I (a bass player) would care for. If you think that it sounds terrible, you need to run through the presets on your surround sound and find the one that suits the mix better. And if you're too lazy to do that, I question your status as an audiophile. As always, Dream Theater is spectacular. I got to see them on the Kansas City stop of the tour, and the sound on the Blu-Ray is quite close to the live concert sound.",1425513600,,774,4.201342281879195
6602011,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"Absolutely great concert!  Yes the sound on the DVD isn't as good as Budokan or Score but it is still very good.  The MP3 sound is excellent. Better sound than Luna Park (where all bass was too soft for DT standards).  The band hasn't lost a step in over 20 years in any area of their performance or product.  (Love the use of the orchestra especially on illumination theory).  Any review of less than 5 stars would hopefully be comparing this to previous DT concerts, because by the low standards most bands have for putting out a live recording this is still a great production.  As far as the people giving it less than 4 stars both prior to and after they had heard or seen the concert, most of them must have been deaf in one ear or sniffing glue.  I've been following Dream Theater since they were formed and a band like this doesn't stay together this long and produce so many high quality albums from lyrics to notes if they weren't great at what they do.  Looking forward to the next LIVE DVD whenever that may be.",1425254400,,1023,4.347368421052631

6602013,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"I watched this dvd with very high expectations and man did they exceed them with this dvd. I was able to see them in Seattle during this tour last year and even got to meet John Petrucci at guitar center during his workshop. Same setlist and show that I saw (minus the orchestra and the choir).

It was truly a full DT experience that my wife and I will never forget and when I saw that they captured it on dvd I had to check it out. The dvd captures every bit of what I saw at the concert and some. I don't know what the fuss is about with audio quality but I think the mix sounds great. The only thing I notced was at the beginning they seemed to be having a hard time getting Labries vocals to blend with the rest of the instruments but thats an entirely different issue that they worked out during the concert. The blue ray quality makes for a crystal clear view of the show as well. If you're having audio griefs change sound settings on the dvd and your stereo, alot of surround sound systems are for watching movies anyway not necessarily for big live concerts so keep that in mind. Anyways buy this dvd and you'll be blown away period.

I am happy to see that James LaBrie's vocals are good, and Mike Mangini has settled in well too, he looks to be very comfortable.

Nothing fancy at all and probably similar to what others have and the surround mix is great on the blue ray.  The concert is probably my favorite other than Score.  Hearing them play with a symphony again is just awesome and this one is special since a few of the band actually went and/or taught at Berkley.

The only negative about the disc is lack of any extra content.  A behind the scenes is always fund but was not included here.  And while Mike Mangini is ridiculously good on drums, I do miss Portnoy as he brings a different type of vibe when he plays.",1419292800,,734,4.163120567375887

My only complaint seems to be that DT was focusing on the sound reproduction and not the live, energetic show from videos formerly released.  Mike Mangini is the greatest drummer since Peart, but it looked like he was holding back to conserve energy for the next night.

Overall, great mix, killer video production, but the energy seemed a bit lower than expected.

UPDATED 12/30/14 ******************************

So I've lived with this for awhile. Too bad I can't revise my review down. I get that this is probably the most talented group of guys in the prog rock/metal world but THIS is the DVD of what is probably their most hyped performance ever?!?! What it is, is the Petrucci/Rudess show. John Petrucci gets the most face time, followed by Jordan Rudess' hand on the expression wheel of his keyboard. Labrie, Myung and Mangini don't get as much combined. Labrie's vocals are unintelligible throughout and Myung gets the same bitch treatment in this mix as he gets on the studio albums... not there at all. Overdubs are obvious and the mix is compressed beyond reason.

I love Dream Theater and I have musician friends who were at the show in Boston and couldn't stop talking about how great it was. Well, I wish I'd been there too. They absolutely failed to capture it with the GoPros on this DVD.",1416787200,2,956,4.712574850299402
6602050,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"Don't let the reviews of bad sound turn you off on purchasing this awesome concert video!

The sound is awesome for a live recording! I played it through a $200 LG soundbar (w/Subwoofer) and I have no complaints! I could hear the vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, drum, and, yes, even the orchestra, just fine. And with the subwoofer, I could hear the double bass drums nicely with just a little bit of oomph!

Furthermore, I love watching such talented musicians play. Incredible is the word I choose to describe it!!!
And, Mr James Labrie, your vocals are incredible too!

Before watching it, I was a little worried about how the orchestra would fit in (both sound wise and video footage). However, I was very pleased with how it turned out! Most of the songs were just DT with only a small portion including the orchestra. And when the orchestra played, they fit nicely into the sound, and the video highlighted them at the right times.

Thanks DT! I look forward to the next!",1416441600,2,978,4.635838150289017

They decided to somehow overlay what was being projected on the overhead screen onto the video. It completely distracts from the experience. The first time I saw this, I stopped the video to go back to the main menu, to see if there was some kind of setting that was wrong. Then I realized it was intended to be that way and was like, ""what the hell...?"" I actually had tickets to the show but work prevented me from going. Now that I have the BRD, I can honestly say that this is the best show that I never saw. I thoroughly recommend it.",1415404800,,692,4.3307692307692305
6602058,3,B00MUDYJ4I,"If you can't stand how Dream Theater's self-titled album sounds, don't expect anything different here. Richard Chycki, the same man behind the god-awful album mix, mans the board for this live experience from Boston. Just like the album, any ride & closed hi hats vanish, the snare is super compressed, the guitars are way too loud - especially mids, and as other said before, the bass lacks tone and definition. The TrueHD mix for sound slightly better than the basic stereo mix, but it's like saying St. Anger's production is better than Death Magnetic's. The guys would do well to find someone else moving forward.",1415145600,,617,4.885714285714286

6602061,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"I had some reservation on  listening to this Dream Theater offering for the very first time. Some of the reviews were a little critical so naturally I was constantly looking for faults instead simply enjoying the trip. The second viewing is where I really really got into it...I upped the overall volume level and got the subs into fifth gear (almost moving on the floor). This is the only way to experience the brilliance of this band...treat it like a live concert and you won't be disappointed. All players can heard as clear as a bell, and for once, John Myung's brilliance hasn't been neglected. James Labrie is in the best form of his life and I was more than impressed... I'm not exaggerating here. All band  members are true virtuoso's and technically unparalleled in the metal world. The selected tracks are some of the best from albums old and new, and the result is an ultra-sonic delight. Highly recommended!",1414972800,3,920,4.74375

6602069,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"I was really excited to have this new live offering from Dream Theater. As a long time fan I know that a live DVD or Blu-Ray from this band would have spectacular performances. The shots on the live footage were much much better than their Luna Park DVD/Blu-Ray.

 The entire band was on fire,the whole set was spectacular and the tracks that they picked were excellent. They celebrated Awake's 20th anniversary by playing certain tracks from that album as well as playing tracks from their classic concept album ""Scenes From A Memory"",as it was the 15th anniversary of that album;however I certainly did wish that they played Fatal Tragedy as part of the ""Scenes From A Memory"" set.

 Now why have I given this release four stars?
Ever since Mike Portnoy has left the band,the bonus content on these live offerings
is absolutely mediocre,it is kind of like just filling the disc for the sake of filling it,like for example
I think they had certain video imagery for Illumination Theory,and they played an audio instrumental in the bonus
section while showing that imagery for 20 plus minutes,I can't exactly recall what track it was but from what I remember it was
""Illumination Theory"". Those 20 minutes could have been used to interview the Berklee Choir/Orchestra or showing how the show
was being prepared for with Eren Basbug,the choir and orchestra. Seriously they added certain audio sections with their live animation from certain tracks as bonus content,that was I think in total 40 to 45 minutes that could have been utilised for something more ""Bonus Content"" worthy. That department has really gone down ever since Mike Portnoy left.

 Now coming to the mix of this live offering;overall it was a good mix but there would have been no harm if the bass was raised up a notch and the Berklee Choir and Orchestra were raised up a notch as well. While they were audible,they sounded more like embellishments rather than enhancements. I think the best mixed live performance is on ""Score"" that should be the blue print for how their mixes should sound on a Blu-Ray and DVD.

Still this is a must buy for any fan or anyone that wants to get the ""Dream Theater"" experience at home.",1414627200,2,2187,4.76984126984127

6602073,1,B00MUDYJ4I,"Aaaaah the complete disservice the digital realm caused to the ears of recent adventurers into the craft of audio mixing, is evident in pretty much all productions of the last 5 years or so in this genre. Rush, Dream Theater, Queensryche... all victims of complete incapacity from their so called ""engineers"" that I bet don't have the basic foundations needed to be in the field. When you listen to music recorded and mixed by older Engineers, from the Analog era, like Paul Northfield for example, you get REAL immersion in crispness, dynamics, perceived heaviness and space. Nowadays, all these self-proclaimed producers, eager to put big name bands in their resumes, get into the studio without a clear understanding of how sound waves work, what frequencies do when they're crammed together and confined in one small area of the audio 'canvas', and many other concepts that are crucial for a decent result.

Why? Why bands like this choose unskilled people to handle their most precious product, their sound? Cost maybe? Are the 50+ year old mixing engineers too expensive nowadays? Those guys are the real deal. Get the kids to slice and splice, but keep them away from the mixing board and all computer plug ins. Seriously.

All Dream Theater band members put so much work into their skills, these guys play so extremely well, it is really a shame to let ""digital generation"" kids ruin their work with brickwalled, loudness wars mixes.

I think it's not the engineers that are going deaf. It must be the band members, because if I was Mangini or Petrucci, I would never, never, never have approved the mix on their last 2 albums and last 2 live DVD/Blu Ray releases (including this one).

Listen to LaBrie's voice on the lower volume acoustic songs. What is that? Digital compression at 20:1, making his breathing louder than his voice.

This is a GREAT show with absolutely horrible sound. A norm nowadays until you get real audio/mixing engineers on board.",1414195200,10,1964,4.885885885885886

It is live after all and to me, all of the people mixing sound (live or studio) don't seem to do a very good job anymore, so I'm just trying to enjoy the music the best I can. The band was great! James had his typical cringe moments, but overall he did well. I would like to see Jordan get rid of that black and red keyboard looking thing. He used it in one song for a short time and it sounded like a cat in pain. John M and John P were terrific as usual and Mike was just astounding. His playing was phenominal and I think he did an excellent job covering the Awake material. My biggest complaint about the whole concert was that someone decided to put graphics over the band during the song Scarred. I didn't understand why they did it and in all honesty it was just annoying. About a quarter of the way through the song it was bothering me so bad that I stopped watching and just listened! I don't know who came up with that idea, but it was just stupid and it is the reason for a four star rating instead of five.  Apart from that, however, like I said above, It was a great concert and I will be watching it again soon.",1414108800,,1291,4.082677165354331

Keys, drums, and lead guitar were OK for me, vocals - meh, bass is inaudible as usual (honestly, for a band that lists Yes and Rush as influences, why won't they let us hear bass?!?).  But the real problem is the rhythm guitar, which is bizarre since it is usually out front and in your face (and almost too loud sometimes).  But here it is buried.  My first thought was that they must have had a bum mic and so just used one of the crowd mics which also picked up the guitar, but I think someone mentioned the CD doesn't have the same mixing problems, so I am at a loss to explain it.  I also wasn't thrilled with the set list, so I don't think I'll be watching this disc again, and it was money wasted (I've watched Score a dozen times at least).  In a shocking development, I just realized that I could hear John's guitar better on the footage of the Vancouver show I had shot with my iPhone.  I don't think this would have happened under Portnoy.

My one caveat is that Illumination Theory may just be worth the price of admission, and is worth the two stars on its own.  Thank goodness they decided to show the orchestra during the middle section instead of that goofy frog video.",1413763200,4,1264,4.317796610169491

6602081,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"I thought this would be good, this is brilliant. Right from the start the boys are right into it.

James LaBrie is in top form vocally and instrumentally John Petrucci, John Myung, Jordan Rudess and Mike Mangini turn in superb performances.

Many many highlights including Shattered Fortress, Trial of Tears, Breaking all Illusions, Space Dye Vest (was never a huge fan of the studio version, this live version is stunning), Finally Free, and just an absolutely riveting performance of Illumination Theory.

Being a part time average drummer in a covers band, I can only imagine the amount of practice these guys must have put in to sound this good it's just phenomenal. (Mike M's performance especially just blew me away, and the kit just sounds fantastic).

Add in a choir and orchestra for the last 45 odd minutes of the concert and its a really special event.

I honestly expected this to be good. Having just watched it for the second time... Visuals, audio, energy, passion, orchestra, choir, audience, production... It's beyond good, this has totally blown away my expectation of good, this is a stellar performance. Well done DT.",1413590400,,1137,4.963157894736842

6602084,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"I attended this show when DT were in my city lat year. I particularly hated the fact that the crowd stood up for the whole 2 1/2 hrs that the show lasted, so it really pissed me off I had to stand up as well, instead of enjoying the show from my seat. This is why I love DT releasing all their shows on DVD/Blu-ray. To be brutally honest, next time I will not attend the show and wait for the BR, because for less than $20 I can enjoy it from the comfort of my living room in great quality bluray.
I give this show 4 stars, not 5, for a couple of reasons: first, the video edition is not as good as it was as I remember it from my live experience. The editor made some poor choices in terms of superposing visual elements that sometimes prevent you from fully enjoying the players' performance. The second reason this is not a 5 stars is because the more I think about it, the more I believe the singer of DT has lost his edge. In funny/visual terms, I'd say I give one star for John, another one for Myung, another one for Ruddess, and another one for Mangini (I am a guitar player, but it is hard not to chose Mangini as the best player of this band!), but I can only give LaBrie half a star. When you watch the instrumental tracks is when you can fully understand what I say. For example Dance of Eternity is a total perfect track here.
Finally, this show includes the Youth Boston orchestra. A lot has been written about this, and I would probably agree with all the criticism. Even the choir in the back, you can barely hear it ... And it is funny how having 20 folks behind doing some back up vocals and John Petrucci is still doing some back up vocals, when clearly, his vocals are not needed when there are 20 other voices (and better than his) behind!
I love this band, but I also would admit that I am not as big fan as I used to be, but this is still an excellent show that you should not miss.",1413244800,2,1905,4.082666666666666
6602085,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"It seems like it was just yesterday that the Luna Park DVD was released. Now it's another one from
the Boston Opera House less than a year later. The show is divided in three acts. The first act is
tracks from the last two albums and the song ""A Trial of Tears"" from ""Falling to Infinity"". The
second act is 5 songs from the ""Awake"" album to celebrate his 20th anniversary and the third act is
the encore celebrating again ""Scene from a Memory"" with his 15th anniversary. On those 2 albums, the
band use the same pattern by starting to play the technical, fast and heavy songs like ""The Mirror"",
""Lie"", ""Overture 1928"" and ""Strange Dj Vu"" and finishing with the slower and emotional songs like
""Lifting Shadows Off A Dream"", ""Space Dye Vest"" and ""Finally Free"".

""The Illumination Theory"", the most progressive and the epic song of the last album is played with
an orchestra in the second act which is the perfect fit with this song that contains an irresistible
classical break in the middle. The picture is crystal clear and the camera work more satisfying than
the ""Luna Park"" DVD. As for the sound, I had to crank up the volume very high to get the full sound.
Again, I wish we could hear John Myung louder, but that's what happens on live recording, it rarely
match the sound quality of a studio release. James Labrie's voice is in nice shape as well as all
others members.  It's another nice addition to your Dream Theater collection.",1413158400,,1440,4.5346153846153845
6602086,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"This is a greater representation of where Dream Theater is at now that they have released two albums without Portnoy drumming for them. I will keep this short and sweet, this is a great live concert! I love the inclusion of the songs from Awake seeing how that is one of my all time favorite albums! Mangini is coming into his own more and more, I love Portnoy but Mangini is really now showing what he's got. As for the mix, on my system it rocks!  Could it be better? Yeah, a little, but it is live and trust me everyone can be heard fine, better than Luna Park and up there with Score.

But why invest so much time writing about technical aspects when it's a show of one of your favorite bands?  Aside from LaBrie being ""pitchy"" at times (which is par for the course), this offering is yet another display of these five masterful musicians at their collective best.  Dream Theater has been my favorite band for the better part of the last 20 years or so.  And I sure am happy I spent the $19.98 to add this latest masterpiece to my collection.

6602090,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"I was really excited to pick this up after seeing DT on their most recent tour. In my opinion they had the best live tone that I'd heard yet in the five shows of theirs I've been to dating back to 2007. The setlist is killer as well. We've all been wanting to hear some more stuff off of Awake and anything from Metropolis Pt. 2 is always great, too! I'd say that the highlight of the whole show is probably Space Dye Vest. DT is finally playing it live and it's great! JP even fancies up the end a bit and makes it more interesting than the studio version.

At the beginning of the show it's a tad bit hard to distinguish the guitar parts, but that improves quickly. Also Myung's bass is a bit too boomy, not too loud, but not mixed as well as would be preferred. However, keep in mind that this is LIVE! It sounds pretty good, IMHO.

As far as the performance goes, usual DT. If you get disappointed when a band isn't running around like crazy then you'll be disappointed here. If you want to hear some amazing musicians blow your mind with their craft, you're going to love it.",1412553600,4,1080,4.21256038647343

6602092,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"I was hesitant to buy this because some of the early reviews about the quality.  Well, I decided to just buy it and I am glad I did. Is it the same show they played on the tour (which I saw in Seattle).  Yep.  But even if they changed up the setlist everynight, there would still be 1 recording released, not multiple from all the different shows.  Illumination Theory and Space Dye Vest are worth the price alone.

Back to the quality.  On my home system, I did have to tweek it a little to get the sounds I wanted.  But most of the time, I am listening on my ipod or watching the ripped video on my Kindle with headphones on, so it is not like I have the greatest multi speaker system to begin with.  I am sure if I had a super balanced system, I might find fault with the sound. Then again, after years of loud music and jet engines and C130 propellers, my highs and lows are off a little.

The orchestra and choir is a nice touch and not intrusive.

Bottom line, it is a DT concert that I can relive.",1412553600,4,1004,4.050761421319797
6602093,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"First off, this Performance is by far better than ""Live at Luna Park"". The set list is much more defined and properly executed, although I would have probably enjoyed ""Home"" as part of the SFAM Encore. If I had to make a few changes to it, I would have added tracks instead of changing any of them. Where is ""The Bigger Picture"" or ""Behind The Veil""? The tracks from AWAKE are a biggy on here, although it could have been better if a medley of the album was made instead of 5 separate tracks. Although ""The Shattered Fortress"" alludes to 5 different albums (Six Degrees - Black Clouds), a separate song from each album would've been nice. One of things I wonder is Why is This Performance was not longer. This is supposed to be the tour of the ""boldest statement"" Dream Theater has recorded and yet is missing many awesome songs. ""Live at Luna Park"" is longer and is supposedly only a ""transitional"" event.

The mixing is not the greatest but it is very complimentary. Everything is heard clearly (except for Myung's bass at some points). many complain at the guitar not having enough low end, the mics being far away from the Drums, the bass sounding like a toy, but take into consideration where this was recorded: an Opera house. The dynamics can get out of control here so in the mixing, they did a pretty good job controlling it. Dream Theater is finally reviving from its dead ""transitional"" period. LaBrie is rapidly progressing in his singing; Mangini is rapidly mastering DT's catalog; Rudess is finally unburied in the mix; Petrucci is finally not overpowering the mix; Myung is just as great as ever! The strings and choir make a perfect combo with the Encore and in ""Illumunation Theory"", it gives you goosebumps! (Note: I am describing the mastering of the DVD release.)

Overall, this release is great! Awesome! This is truly a must-get for every DT fan or listener! It won't disappoint!",1412467200,2,1901,4.6716417910447765

I cannot imagine what any of the reviewers were listening to or watching! They are ALL completely wrong...every one of them. The production and sound quality on this release is superb. Please don't listen to any of the other reviews...get this DVD and support the band.

While Luna Park has the keyboards way too low in the mix, Breaking the Fourth Wall has them turned up quiet a bit more, making Dream Theater's sound much fuller. The orchestra and choir add richness to the sound as well during the latter part of the show. My only criticism is these two sets don't have as many technical instrumental passages as I would like, primarily because so much of the second set consists of music from Awake. However, I do like the songs from Awake, most of which were never included in previous DVDs. All in all, one of my favorite Dream Theater DVDs. I would have liked more special features, but you can't complain about having two hours and forty-five minutes of top notch performances.",1412380800,3,861,4.561290322580645
6602096,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"Good show. Worth it for the performance of Illumination Theory alone. Very odd editing and sequence of the show. These are the same guys who filmed Rush's R-30 and Snakes and Arrows Live DVD's.

Crowd seemed absolutely removed from the performance which is a very common problem with the guys at Fogo Labs. They take the audience and audio of the crowd out of their shows and I for one am not a fan of that. I like feeling like I am there not watching a soundcheck.

My gripe with Dream Theater these days is their refusal to do a different set list every night like they used to with Portnoy in the band when he wrote the lists every night. They have basically become as predictable as Rush in a live setting and I am not sure why?

That ruined the spontaneity of the night. We knew what the set was going to be going into this show.

Much better than Luna Park which was another disjointed mess. People should stop hiring Rich Chycki already. DT could use Terry Brown in a BIG way now that Portnoy is out of the picture and their mutual dislike for each other has no bearing on the DT members today.",1412380800,2,1101,4.278846153846154
6602097,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"Hello. I have never reviewed a Dram Theater release before, so this is my first one, although I have all their DVD's.

First, I'm gonna say about the sound: Mix is not perfect, but I still like it. I mean, it has a live sound feeling, with the drums sounding like if the mics were a little far, but I like it that away. I never expect a live release to sound with studio quality. And here you can hear all the instruments well, is more balanced than the last 2 (Luna Park and Chaos). And you can hear the audience very well too. That is in 5.1, but in stereo almost all the sound from the audience is gone, drums and guitar are louder and James' voice is clearer, in 5.1 is somewhat behind the instruments, but you still can hear him.

I have the DVD version, and image is not that clear, sometimes it looks like when you play videos from CD's in your computer back in the days. It is not pixelated, but more like compressed. I don't know why is compressed if the concert is divided in 2 DVDs. Talking about that, 2 DVD's, I didn't like that. Is one of the reasons I don't like PULSE by Pink Floyd. That I have to change DVD to see second part, and here it is like that. First set on DVD 1, with no extras, no nothing to make it worth the separation, and set 2 on DVD 2, also with almost no extras (the extras add very little), So I really don't know why the put it in 2 DVDs.

Now the performance: I's great, I think it is the best I have seen from DT on DVD after Budokan.
Altough I didn't like set 1 that much. I feel 'On the backs of angels' and 'Trial of tears' didn't have to be there. I didn't like last CD that much and, well, they play that much, but that is fine, it was that tour, but they didn't include the song I liked the most after 'Illumination Theory': 'Behind the veil'. I was hoping for that one, and 'Learning to live' or something more than Trial of Tears that is played the same way as in Budokan.

Second set is the best IMO, I just hoped they included 'Fatal Tragedy', with orchestra and choir!!!, but you can't have it all :P
The highlight for me was 'Space Dye Ves't followed by the introduction of 'Illumination Theory' :o
Plus the choir really added to the Scenes from a Memory songs.",1412380800,3,2213,4.10392609699769
6602098,4,B00MUDYJ4I,Any true Dreamtheater Fan would love this footage. They have gotten better over the last few years..I know thats hard to believe. Once again if you are a true fan this is a MUST SEE.,1412294400,,182,4.228571428571429
6602099,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"You get used to the sound (I listened to the stereo mix using the excellent HE-400 headphones, and it was ... OK.  Better than a youtube video, slightly.  As someone else wrote, Myung sounded particularly weak, like he was playing through a K-mart practice amp)  I wish DT would just hire Steven Wilson to do their mixes for them. The performances and song selection are great so I'll give them a passing grade.
edit: watched it again, and I'm giving it an extra star just for Mike Mangini.  He was always known for his technique, but heavy touring with DT has turned him into an absolute monster.  He looks like he's having the time of his life (as do the entire band), so all in all it was a very heart warming show to watch.",1412294400,4,727,4.355555555555555
6602100,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"I bought this on release day and watched the whole thing until almost 1am that night. I honestly think this is their best DVD overall next only to Score (which is likely never to be topped IMO).

The setlist is pretty odd but very good. It showcases many songs off DT's last 2 releases with drummer Mike Mangini. The songs they choose are some of the best from those albums, with Breaking All Illusions and Through the Looking Glass proving to be modern DT-day classics without doubt. The second set features the entire second half of the Awake album, the new epic Illumination Theory, and a 4 song encore from SFAM.

Sound-wise, in PCM 5.1 Stereo I thought it sounded much better than the Live at Luna Park mix (which was super guitar and almost no bass or keyboards). They still don't show Myung as much as they probably should, and maybe for the first time ever they seem to back off on showing Jordan as much as they usually do. He does still break out the Keytar on a couple songs and take center stage which never gets old and is a joy to see.

Visually, this DVD looks excellent. There aren't a million edits every 2 or 3 seconds for today's A.D. crowd and for that I'm thankful. Another reviewer mentioned this already but I agree there aren't really a lot of times where all 5 of the guys are in the same shot together. They do some cool split-screen stuff for guitar / keyboard unisons and it fits together well. I also gotta' say it's so good to see everybody looking like they're having a legitimate GOOD TIME on stage. James makes a crack during the end of The Mirror that is a certifiable laugh out loud moment, you'll see it's funny as hell.

I'm a big Portnoy fan but finally I think this show has won me over to the Mangini side of things. His technical ability was never ever in question- I mean just look at the crazy things he does during this, you won't believe your eyes / ears- but now he's making goofy faces and having some fun with the rest of the guys. There's a point during his drum solo (in Enigma Machine) where it's like he screwed up and forgot to hit a cowbell or something that's really funny. And his snare finally sounds good too! He's a true showman and doesn't have to resort to covering Petrucci's amps with spittle, labeling a batch of Rock Juice, or dying his beard blue (no offense, MP!) My only quibble with the drums would be how he plays the ending of Finally Free. I was really enjoying this excellent version of the song and the whole time was thinking ""Wow, wait until the end drum solos / fills- Mangini's going to go nuts!!"" But sadly, it never happened as he plays almost that whole part subdued. Suprising, but really that's my only minor complaint when it comes to the drums on this.

Speaking of Petrucci, he brings out 4 or 5 of his signature Majesty guitars for this show and WOW are they incredible. I don't know how much something like that might cost but they are some sweet-ass instruments to behold. His playing as always is inpeccable, though I'm not entirely sold on him playing what's supposed to be the keyboard outro on Space Dye Vest. Oh well, at least they finally played it!

Illumination Theory is a highlight on this. It's a song that's never really grown on me but live with the Berklee orchestra it's amazing. And before anybody has any wrong ideas, the orchestra isn't super overpowering nor is it even in the concert for very long (only about 4-5 songs at the end).

The most notable part of this entire show though has to be the much-improved vocals for James LaBrie. It's now common (?) knowledge, but they did go back and tweak some of his singing here and there in places in the editing room. I think this maybe happened less than 10 times total during the 3 hour show.

To this end, I have to ask the real DT fans like me out there this question:

""Would you rather they go back and do some pitch corrections a handful of times to give you a great concert you're going to want to see lots of times, or would you rather have something like Live at Budokhan where poor James' voice falls apart after the 2nd song and is all over the place that you'll likely watch once?""

James is a GREAT singer. Can he match that famous F# from Learning to Live anymore? No, but who can sing like that forever, right? That's like asking Geddy Lee to go out there next tour and sing Cygnus X-I and Hemispheres back to back. It ain't gonna' happen anymore. In the studio, James still sounds excellent on their newer stuff and is still a creative vocalist who brings loads to the table. On the road he is and has been improving for years now. And to top it off the guy is just plain THE MAN.

A highly recommended concert, it's a must-buy for any DT fan or newcomer alike.",1412294400,32,4733,4.354875283446712
6602101,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"Okay, I'm not enamored of the mix, either, but just like attending a live concert, you kinda get used to the sound (as imperfectly balanced as it may be) and then you get over it and enjoy the show. I think the Illumination Theory section is one of the most impressive recorded live performances I have ever seen.
I loved ""Score"" but this orchestra is actually better with DT.
I'd have to say, if you liked ""Score"" you pretty much have to own this disc, too. A must for the modern Dream Theater fans. I bought it immediately after viewing a friends copy.",1412294400,2,554,4.388349514563107
6602102,1,B00MUDYJ4I,"Please note: this review is for the Stereo CD or specifically the HDTracks 96/24 Stereo version of this recording. Buyer beware!!! The stereo mix is simply awful. I have no live recordings all the way back to the '60s that are this badly done. The recording sounds as though two tin cans were used. Instruments are out of proportion (drums/guitar overrides vocals/bass/keyboards). The guy that mixed this and produced it is deaf. Simply terrible. I cannot write reviews on HDTracks (big problem there because everything they sell is not great) but felt the need to warn people here not to spend $26 on that recording. I'm very unhappy about it and enough said.

However, there have been some complaints about the Blu-Ray mix on this live video too. I have not bought this yet, may do so at some point, but cannot personally review this video at this time. But if it sounds anything like the stereo mix, then you might want to think twice about investing. Sorry, DT. I'm a huge fan and will always be of your previous recordings. I was not at all happy about the 2013 Dream Theater album mix either - sounded as though someone just down-sampled the 5.1 mix into stereo and things are buried on that recording too. I hope they fire their engineers. Now that DT is really gaining some uber popularity, they should be releasing their best sounding recordings, not this horribly bad stuff.",1412294400,5,1384,4.695473251028806

The PCM is definitely the way to go.  With the Dolby TrueHD (huh?) the sound just seems to die out of the speakers even though I had it turned up 15 notches higher.  I don't know who's system that sounds good on but it's not mine, and I'm happy with the way my other DT discs sound.

On the bright side, the visuals are very good.  No break-neck editing, nice colorful stage, and they show the band not the drooling audience members.  And of course the performances are usual DT excellency.  Just gotta tweak that audio as best you can.",1412208000,5,704,4.3538461538461535

DT is second only to Rush in my musical heart.

6602107,1,B00MUDYJ4I,"As many will attest to, the Boston Opera House concert was fantastic. This DVD is not. In short, I'll list some of the problems:

1. Very tinny and muddy guitar sound, with no bottom end.
2. Lifeless drums - not the Thunder God toms we heard on tour.
3. Extremely annoying lip syncing and pitch correction on James LaBrie's vocals
4. No bass, anywhere. Is Myung even playing?

This is unfortunately the kind of really bad sounding product we've come to expect from Dream Theater. Unfortunately, these guys spend eons practicing and composing, and apparently no time at all making sure what goes out the door actually sounds good.",1412121600,8,629,4.761467889908257

The performances have nothing to be desired, majestic virtuosity. The animation videos are very realistic. The only reason I give it four stars is because James, though he tries, is not a vocalist that matches the other performers (sorry diehard fans!). I imagine Khan (ex-Kamelot vocalist) singing with them.

Some of the reviews about having classical instruments and voices in the performance are making too much out of it. They are barely distinguishable in most of the number they perform in.",1412121600,,670,4.982142857142857

6602111,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"EDITED

I got my bluray/3 CD combo direct from Roadrunner Records a day early and was pretty excited about playing it.  My excitement was initially short lived through both the PCM stereo and Dolby TrueHD mixes.  But I've given the stereo mix another chance and it's really not too bad, but far from the best live mix I've heard.  I'll wait until I have the house to myself before I try the DTS-MA mix again--I have since listened to the Dolby mix again and my opinion has not changed.  Video quality is excellent, but editing leaves a little to be desired.

Side bar: Many have already mentioned the Luna Park BD and their opinions of the sound mix of that release.  Now, let's all remember for a second that Luna Park was delayed six months so it could be ""worthy"" of release.  This one feels like it may have been hurried out the door a bit.

Back to the review.

While the Luna Park DTS-MA mix on bluray was not ideal, it is better than the bluray Breaking the Fourth Wall Dolby TrueHD mix and this is really a shame.  I've read the arguments that this is a ""live"" recording--I get that.  But there is something really wrong with the uncompressed multi-channel mix on the bluray version of Breaking the Fourth Wall.  There are a couple of times in both stereo and Dolby TrueHD where Mangini's cannon toms sound like they are mic'd up 100 feet away.  The rest of the stereo mix is just a little inconsistent, not as clean as I would have expected.  But the Dolby TrueHD mix just lacks presence and sounds disconnected as a whole.

At times, the video jumps around a bit and doesn't allow viewers to relate more to the individual musicians and then group as a whole.  This is evident during the faster songs where the shot is over here for two seconds, over there for three, back over here for three seconds.  John Petrucci explains the need for the staccato riffs in ""The Enemy Inside"", so I get the frantic video editing, but, for me, it just feels a bit disconnected.  I'm reminded of the Joe Satriani Live in Paris release which was totally unwatchable.  It's like a teenager just tried out his video editing software for the first time.  The slower Dream Theater songs seem to allow for a more relaxed editing process, but I think that would have worked better throughout and resulted in a better video product.

One saving grace for me on this release is that I bought the BD-3CD release from Roadrunner Records.  The CD mix is better than the bluray.

I give this an edited four stars (up from my initial three).  My expectations for the BD were not met in the Dolby TrueHD mix, but the CD set helps save this a bit.",1412035200,14,2625,4.430062630480167
6602112,5,B00MUDYJ4I,"I own every single concert DVD and Blu-ray that Dream Theater has put out and this is my favorite. I read a complaint about the sound quality, but I thought it sounded great. I really like the song selection, mixing old and new tunes so every concert release has fresh material. Every band member is in top form as expected. Crazy technical guitar, bass and keyboard playing. James Labrie's vocals sound better here than he did when he was younger. Mike Mangini is a machine on drums and while I always respected his talent, this blu-ray has made me a huge fan. Worth every bit of $15!",1412035200,,585,4.4766355140186915
6602113,1,B00MUDYJ4I,"Note, my criticism of this concert is in its mix and presentation, not the performance. The band and the orchestra are both in top form and play as impressively as you would hope.

As a long-time fan of DT (and especially John Petrucci), as soon as this set arrived I anxiously fed the BD into my home theater and went right for ""Illumination Theory,"" my favorite DT song ever.

Then my heart sank and I shook my head in disgust. This concert sounds dreadful. There are two audio options: PCM Stereo and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (surprisingly, no DTS-HD MA). Both tracks sound anemic, compressed and have their midranges blown out. After I went all the way through ""Illumination Theory,"" I started hop-scotching around to other tracks (""Lifting Shadows,"" ""Along for the Ride,"" ""Overture 1928,"" ""Breaking All Illusions"") to see if the whole thing was this terrible. It was.

The orchestra sounds great, especially during ""Illumination Theory's"" interlude, but the band's portion of the track is mixed so poorly that it's shocking. Petrucci's playing is all midrange and no balls, and some of his solos sound muddy and get lost in the mix. Myung sounds like he's playing a budget bass and amp starter set bought at Kmart, and not a Music Man Bongo through a Mesa amp, one of the most aggressive bass combos you can put together. His strings sound like floppy dental floss. It was especially heart breaking to hear him on ""Illumination Theory"" when he intros the post-orchestra movement. Rudess sounds okay, but mostly because his portion of the mix does not have much low end. He's mixed better than the guitars. Mangini's thunderous drum work is relegated to kitten status... again, no low end. LaBrie's vocals are blown out in the mix, and are particularly bad when he lets loose. Overall, everyone in the mix, from the orchestra to the band sound like they have a palpable veil of compression spread over everything. I have heard MP3 tracks sound better than this.

I don't know what in the sweet hell happened here, but this release is inexcusably bad. It could be that the Boston Opera House's acoustics are not ideal for rock music and it was very difficult to compensate in the mix. If that was the case, they should have recorded this elsewhere, Berklee participation be damned. I would rather the recording sound amazing.

I would like Roadrunner to fix this release and reissue something worthy of the money.",1412035200,51,2408,4.806763285024155
6602114,4,B00MUDYJ4I,"Just got it yesterday (9/26/14) Blu-Ray version direct (and early) from Roadrunner, and it is a very good package - watched it twice already! Love them! I saw them a few weeks after this show was filmed in San Francisco, and it was very similar to what I see here, so it was exciting to see and reminisce. There's great camera work and picture quality, a nice song list, and of course the always stellar musicianship they always bring. The Awake and Scenes From A Memory songs are done super well, and they bring new life to them and they sound fresh. Jordan playing these older ""classics"" makes them even better. James LaBrie is in top form as has been the case for several years now, seems to be ever improving like a fine wine, sounds great! Of course Petrucci is as consistent as ever with fantastic tone, as is Myung - solid, but suffers from this not-so-perfect mix. Mangini is amazing and pulls off feats that seem nearly impossible - too bad his sound isn't mixed better for this package.

A couple of issues: 1) The sound could be better, the mix is weird, the bass too low, and the drums too tinty. Luna Park had a much better sound IMO. Not sure what Richard Chycki was hearing when mixing this. Also, the editing was too severe, almost no crowd interaction from LaBrie, which when added makes a show feel more whole. 2) The Special Features are pretty weak and really don't add any value to the package whatsoever. Some bonus tracks (like Luna Park) and a documentary on playing this historic theater, along with how they prepared for the event would have been very appropriate for this release (I mean 3 of them have a personal history with Berklee). I would have waited two more months to have those things included. 3) The menu format is weird, the cool intro is one section all alone, then it loads the second section (the first song and first set), then the third section (second set), then the fourth (encore). It just breaks it up oddly and takes some of the overall vibe away. It doesn't make it feel like a complete show. However, once the songs load and play - amazing!

Putting all of that aside, I love these guys, and will continue to put this one on frequently. I disagree about the comments of ""yet another band paired with an orchestra"" in this case - though I get that and generally concur. Here, it is actually done tastefully and very subtle keeping very much to the original versions. Not ""over-baked"". Additionally, it is only done for the last few songs, not the whole show. Not like the crap Metallica (LOL) put out with an orchestra, just plain cheese that was! Dream Theater (like most things they do), do it effectively.
