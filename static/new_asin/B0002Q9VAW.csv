8030590,5,B0002Q9VAW,"The double DVD ""Of Human Bondage/Blood on the Sun"" is the best quality transfer of the film ""Of Human Bondage"" that I have been able to find. It is extremely difficult to get information on the quality of DVD transfers for films which have passed into the public domain. I went through several other editions before finding this transfer. While there are a few places where frames have been lost, the picture and sound quality are superior. An excellent film which deserves Criterion treatment--and by the way, how about a Leslie Howard Collection on DVD? Where are ""Outward Bound"", ""Berkeley Square"", ""It's Love I'm After"", and ""Pimpernel Smith"", to name a few?",1151884800,7,662,4.919642857142857
