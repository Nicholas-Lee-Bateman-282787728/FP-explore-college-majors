8502919,5,B006PTVRY8,"If you haven't discovered DB and her band, start right here. This 'gigamentary' is a great insight into a tight-knit group that's captivating to watch. Ms Bogart is such a talented musician and a dynamic performer. Let Bogart take you on a journey to what she calls 'Deanna-land', where the music takes her to a place that moves her and touches the listener. I thoroughly recommend the ride.",1328659200,3,391,4.764705882352941
