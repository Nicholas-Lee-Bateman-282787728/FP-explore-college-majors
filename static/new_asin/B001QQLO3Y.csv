8336175,5,B001QQLO3Y,"I bought this DVD thinking it might be a good recital to watch
but it's so nice to see that my daughter stuck with it and just makes little
improvement each time she watches and dances with it.
She's already asking more questions in her dance class on complicated footwork
that she watched and her around the house dancing now has a Bharatanatyam artist look to it.
She prefers this DVD over her other DVD because it inspired my daughter to get
up and dance and added more fun with her dance practises",1290038400,2,501,4.397849462365591
