8329450,4,B001O4C6KI,"The London newspaper headline on May 3, 1972, was ""London Diamond Heists"", a daring robbery by a gang that will become known as the Invisibles. These phenomenally smart and able burglars turned into superstars - and then 18 years ago they apparently vanished, never caught, never named, never prosecuted.

Now, it's 2008. We watch Babs and Maurice (pronounced Morris) Riley and their pal, Sydney Woolsey, move into the Harbor View luxury senior apartments. They had been living in Spain for 18 years, but Babs did not want to die in a foreign country. So they've moved back to England and this quiet Devon fishing village. And nobody will ever find out they are the remaining 2 members of the great Invisibles. That includes Grace, the Riley's 22 year-old daughter, who thinks her dad worked in a bank.

So keeping this secret is the big plan. But the guys didn't count on running into the child of their dead 3rd partner. They didn't plan on coming face-to-face with ""Knacker of the Yard"", a retired cop who chased them for the 8 years they were active. And they didn't plan on Syd's hapless son getting in trouble with loan sharks.

When Mo doesn't get home until 3 am, his beloved Babs is suspicious, ""You promised me, Maurice, you'd never ever go back to work. No more crime.""
Maurice: ""And I meant it.""
Babs: ""Then you're having an affair. What's her name?""

That is just one example of the fun in this series. And there is a lot of it. In Episode 3, Syd totally loses his focus when he falls, again, for a woman from his past. Maurice rakes him over the coals for it. Then, in Episode 4, Maurice totally loses his focus when he falls under the spell, again, of the Iron Lady. The Iron Lady, a safe he tried to crack six times and never succeeded. Maurice talks about it like a long-lost love.

""The Invisibles"" originally aired on BBC in May/June, 2008. It has 6 episodes that total 347 minutes of comedy. This series has a lot going for it in its characterizations and zany plots. But sometimes the plots are too improbable, such as when the guys have to crack the safe in a bed headboard, while the owner is sleeping in the bed. Somehow the fellow manages to sleep through the Invisibles moving him around in the bed and Syd ""whispering"" at airplane take-off decibels. They also overdo Maurice's angst over getting old and getting rusty, as well as Syd's bumbling.

Overall, a fun series. To me it was a comedy, not a crime drama. It's not quite a 5-star series for me, so I give it 4.3 stars rounded down to 4.

The 2-disc DVD series is presented in 16:9 widescreen and stereo. The only DVD bonus features are Cast Filmographies to read on 6 of the main actors.

Trivia: In the 2nd episode, Babs invites Knacker and his wife to dinner, not realizing he was a cop who suspected them 18 years ago. Because Grace will be at dinner, too, the Invisibles try to figure out what foods might keep Knacker so busy chewing that he can't bring up their life of crime. Hedley, owner of the local pub, recommends a ""tagine"", because it's ""like a mouthful of Araldite if it's cooked properly.""  If you didn't know, Araldite is the brand name of an epoxy glue, and a tagine is a traditional Berber (usually clay) covered cooking vessel.

8329453,5,B001O4C6KI,This is just a fun show.  I enjoyed it very much and was disappointed that it only ran one season.  I enjoyed all of the actors and how they had great chemisty.  Anthony Head is the best.,1301702400,2,187,4.0
8329454,5,B001O4C6KI,"It's hard to overstate how good this show is (well, except for the music, which is very BBC House Band), and should be an immediate grab for fans of Anthony Head at his very best, caper films or even stories like Lonesome Dove, focusing on aging heroes.

The basics of the show are strong on their own: Nationally famous burglars who have never been caught and who retired to Spain, return to England to be closer to family and friends in their 60s. It's not long, however, before they're back on the job. Like the best police shows, though, the capers are really just the backdrop for the meat of the show: The Invisibles relationships with their families. The show may feature burglars, but it's about growing older, dealing with adult children, dealing with old loves, dealing with being the person you want your children to know their parents as, and so on.

This is really Head's show. He may be beloved by Buffy fans, but he didn't get to do much other than be very English, and when they tried to give him more to do, his post-high school bachelorhood was awkward and somewhat directionless. Here, though, he gets free range with a character and story made to showcase his talents.

Head's Maurice (pronounced ""Morris,"" in an English attempt to baffle American audiences) was the greatest burglar in England, the smartest man in pretty much every room and a man among men. Now he's grappling with the notion that his best days are behind him, his daughter doesn't know who he really is (he's lied to her for decades about what he does for a living), his beautiful wife is focused on creating a life for herself outside of the world of crime, his best friend is not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer and while he still looks (very) good for his age, getting older scares the hell out of him.

It's baffling that this wasn't picked up for a second season by the BBC, but by no means should that dissuade anyone from picking this up. This is easily one of the best shows I've ever seen, and an absolute tour de force for Anthony Head.

Endorsed without reservation for fans of caper movies or Buffy the Vampire Slayer.",1247961600,11,2129,4.5483028720626635
8329455,5,B001O4C6KI,"The newspaper review of the Invisibles is why we ordered it, the critic reccomended it.  We watched all episodes and enjoyed it very much.  If you like British shows go ahead and get this!",1247443200,4,188,4.5
8329456,5,B001O4C6KI,"THE INVISIBLES was a crackerjack BBC comedy crime series that arrived in 2008 and is now hitting the shelves in DVD format.  The whole run is only six episodes and, sadly, there won't be a second season.

My wife and I love these kinds of shows, kind of edgy with fun characters and snappy one-liners that you have to pay attention to in order to appreciate.  And THE INVISIBLES had all of that in spades.

Anthony Head (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) and Warren Clarke (DALZIEL AND PASCOE) star as Maurice Riley and Syd Woolsey respectively.  They're retired thieves that were once at the top of the game.  Called The Invisibles by the media because there was never a trace of them though everyone knew they were about, Maurice and Syd were never caught and chose to retire to a seaside Devon village.

The shows center on the relationship of the two men, the respective extended families, and the fact that they don't like growing older.  Even though both of them have enough to live comfortably on, they both can't keep their minds out of the crime arena.

I really enjoyed the comfortable byplay between Maurice and Syd, as well as Maurice's wife Barbara (played by Jenny Agutter, SPOOKS).  When Dean Lennox Kelly weighed in as Hedley Huthwaite, the son of the deceased third Invisible, things really started to cook.  All six of the episodes turn on robberies and thefts, so there is plenty of action, but they all explore bits and pieces of the characters and their interactions as well.

The first episode really leaned into the relationship between Maurice and Syd and how they rely on each other.  But Syd's son Joe gets crossways with loansharks and the Invisibles have to get back in the game to steal Joe's life and future back for him.  Syd's life is as chaotic and full of disaster as Maurice's seems to be filled with smooth sailing.

The second episode delivers a twist on expectations when a retired police detective shows up with evidence he has on the Invisibles.  Instead of arresting them, he blackmails them into doing a job for him.  Maurice's daughter Grace (played by Emily Head, Anthony Head's real life daughter) puts in her first appearance in the series.  She has no idea what her father did.

The third episode deals with Maurice's relationship turning rocky for a time while Syd goes head over heels for an old flame.  By this time, the writing and the characters have gotten really smooth.  There are more gags, more biting sarcasm and funny repartee, as well as enough character weight to feel the risks that are going on.

In the fourth episode, Maurice has to deal with the one safe he couldn't crack.  Everyone around him assures him that the safe is cursed, but Maurice just can't back away from the challenge.  I especially liked this one because it showed how competitive Maurice is and also played him off all the other characters.

The human factor kicks in again in the fifth episode when Hedley discovers his wife is pregnant and wants out of the gang.  I liked the fact that she knows what her husband is doing, though, and that touch really makes this episode spin.

And the sixth episode puts Maurice and Syd smackdab in the middle of a police siege.  The dialogue and situation here is great even though we've seen similar plots.  The cleverness is really well done too.

All in all, these six episodes are real keepers for fans of BBC crime shows.  With summer reruns glutting the channels, picking up this series on DVD would be a good investment.",1245196800,14,3491,4.655228758169935
