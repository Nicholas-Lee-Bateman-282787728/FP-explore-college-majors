5572471,5,B00BC36XSM,"Absolutely love the True Blood series.. this is the entire series at a great price!! Over $100 cheaper than other box sets I've seen and it'd cost a whole lot more if you bought each season seperately!! The only issue I've come across so far is the inside of one of the cases was broken.. it's not a huge deal to me though since all discs were in great condition still!!!
I absolutely recommend buying this!!!!",1423440000,2,410,4.407894736842105

5572567,4,B00BC36XSM,"This is a great series and the characters really evolve from season to season.  It was really surprising to find in the special features that some of these actors with convincing southern accents are actually british or aussie.  Unfortunately, some of the discs were finicky and would not play in my newer Samsung BD player, so I had to hook up my ten year old Panasonic BD player which worked fine.",1492473600,2,399,4.605633802816901

5572698,5,B00BC36XSM,I enjoyed the series. That is why I bought the complete collection. And besides who doesn't enjoy Eric Northman?,1440374400,6,112,4.947368421052632
5572699,5,B00BC36XSM,"If you like freaky sex with some story between each time it happens then get this. As long as Paquin keeps her shirt on everything is good. Mostly those who have watched each show the night they came out will get this, but if you are on the fence about getting it and haven't seen/heard any of it then go ahead unless you are a Twilight fan you better pass. There are NO glitter vamps in this fang bang movie. The ""boy gets the girl"" story line isn't there either, it is more like ""The boy gets the girl and that girl and that girl plus those girls at the same time"" kind of movie.
The great thing about True blood is NO ONE is safe from being killed off. You might get attached to one character and then BOOM they took a steak to the heart or all their blood was sucked out.",1438819200,7,775,4.038961038961039
5572700,5,B00BC36XSM,Wasn't expecting to much from this series but that changed real quick. Great choice of actors and writers.,1435363200,3,106,4.944444444444445

5572703,4,B00BC36XSM,Great price! Received on time. My only issue was the paper case that goes around the blu rays was torn and damaged. No biggie though...,1431302400,4,135,4.44
5572704,5,B00BC36XSM,Awesome set,1428796800,,11,5.0
8565785,2,B00BC36XSM,"I thought everything was OK until season 3 when Eric Northman was speaking German. The subtitles where cut off in mid word horizontally and the lower line did not show at all. I couldn't read them. Other than that the picture and sound are excellent. I would not recommend buying this set because they are what is called region free. Meaning they will work in any region. Spend the extra 10 bucks and get Region 1/ N. America. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was this problem. The seller was fast, I got it in one day. I would do business with this seller again.",1530144000,,564,4.280373831775701
8565786,1,B00BC36XSM,Half of the blu rays are unable to play.,1529798400,,40,3.5555555555555554
8565787,5,B00BC36XSM,"So happy I found this. I started watching this series about 2 months after I lost my best friend in a car accident. They had mentioned I would like it but I never gave it a chance while they were alive. Another pal let me watch with them when it was on, to get me out of my room and to fulfill that promise to watch it sometime. So to me this show was a stepping stone to getting out of my shell and growing more. So glad I can become engulfed in this crazy true blood world once again. As silly as it sounds, this show saved me.",1526342400,,529,3.8623853211009176
8565788,3,B00BC36XSM,I like the series but my 1st season disks 2 and 5 won't play in my bluray player (U.S. bluray player). I checked all the rest of the disks and they work. I would like to get that fixed. Other than that it shipped here on time.,1524096000,,226,3.8297872340425534
8565789,5,B00BC36XSM,Plays great! All discs were in immaculate condition! Delivered on time! S,1523577600,,73,5.166666666666667
8565790,4,B00BC36XSM,All was good until one DVD from season 5 had a skipping issue and you miss about 5minutes of a seen. No visible scratches or anything to explain why.,1523318400,,149,4.172413793103448
8565791,1,B00BC36XSM,This is HBO UK version and is NOT compatible with US DVD players.,1522972800,,65,4.076923076923077
8565792,5,B00BC36XSM,Great,1520726400,,5,5.0
8565793,5,B00BC36XSM,Great HBO series with a little something for everyone.  Tried to watch it when it aired but missed several episodes and the last Season and a half.  Now can watch it in bluray at my leisure.  Highly recommend this series,1519862400,,220,4.45
8565794,1,B00BC36XSM,I'm upset that it won't play in my Sony DVD player or my Blu-Ray player. It needs to be specified that this may or may not play in American DVD players!!,1519776000,,153,3.967741935483871
