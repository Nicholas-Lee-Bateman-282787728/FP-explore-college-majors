They say that when life hands you a lemon, make lemonade.  Well, that's pretty much what actress/comedienne Annabelle Gurwitch did when she was summarily fired from a Woody Allen play.  She turned her experience first into a successful stage show, and then into a feature-length documentary, appropriately entitled ""Fired!""

Gurwitch uses this film not merely as therapy for herself but as a means of comforting other people who have experienced the same situation.  In wildly funny terms, the filmmaker reenacts the euphoric moment when she first heard that she had been hired by the great director, then the personally devastating scene when she was dismissed from the production, and finally the initial dark days of depression immediately following the canning.  She then chronicles the proactive steps she took to convert her sour experience into a sweet-tasting personal triumph.  After seeking solace and advice from an assortment of friends, therapists and clergy (also reenacted here), she decided to delve into other people's stories about being fired and to use them as material for a stand-up comedy stage show of which she herself was the host.  When that turned out to be a hit, Gurwitch decided to make a documentary film about the experience.

In the movie, she interviews well-known comic celebrities such as Fred Willard, Anne Meara, Tim Allen, Andy Dick, Illeana Douglas and others on their experiences of losing a job and provides snippets of her stage show as well.  She also sets up a booth at a local job fair to hear the firing stories of some of the people there.  Towards the end of the movie, Gurwitch launches her own Michael Moore-style investigation into some of the dismissal practices of massive corporations like GM, and interviews people whose job it is to ""soften the blow"" of firing.

With this small but entertaining film, Gurwitch and her comic buddies gently apply the healing balm of laughter to one of the most painful aspects of human life.",1186012800,3,1990,5.033536585365853
2744588,3,B000MRNWQK,"By now, all corners of the universe have been notified that actress Annabelle Gurwitch got the sack from Woody Allen, who said of her performance: ""You look retarded."" Gurwitch used her humiliation as inspiration for an off-off-Broadway event, a book and this movie.

""Fired!"" is a pretty good film about bad life experiences. Mostly, Gurwitch wanders around interviewing the famous (Sarah Silverman, Tim Allen) and the unknown about what it's like being terminated and surviving. The best bit for me was when she shoots hoops with a former human resources exec, who reveals a few dirty secrets and explains why you're cooked when the words ""As you know ... "" come out.

The extras are more of the same, nothing special. Audio and video are OK for a low-budget effort.",1181520000,,768,4.9
2744589,5,B000MRNWQK,I saw this film in the theater and really loved it.  It is funny and genuinely informative.  Ms. Gurwitch demonstrates that a documentary film doesn't have to be dull.,1175558400,2,167,4.724137931034483

Didn't someone involved with this project speak up and say, ""You shouldn't have music playing when people are speaking.  Especially when the voices were recorded live, on location.  Passing trucks, in particular.  At least use sub-titles.""

Anyway, this movie is ruined for me and goodbye to my $2.99.",1402185600,,488,5.17948717948718
8171375,2,B000MRNWQK,"Is the 2007 documentary FIRED! supposed to be about losing one's job for just or unjust reasons, as in stealing from the cash register or discrimination, respectively?  Or is this film about being not so much fired, which implies punitive action, and more in the sense of a layoff, where there just isn't enough work for the staff so some are dismissed?  Or, is it about losing a job that was going to end anyway, which is the situation that inspires actor Annabelle Gurwitch to make FIRED! after being fired from a play by a famous director, by definition temporary employment?

FIRED! seems to be about all three scenarios though the way it zigs and zags, you may not be sure if that's its purpose.  I'm not sure Ms. Gurwitch and her fellow filmmakers have much in mind other than to send her out to talk to anyone who will listen about what happened to her at her acting job.  Try talking to everyone about the same topic and you'll get what we see in FIRED!: Some responses are interesting, others aren't.  FIRED!'s attempts are humor are less successful.

I wrongly thought FIRED! was going to address the American government's appalling lack of a long overdue (by about 30 years as I write this in 2014) jobs program.  However, the closest to anything other than one personal account of unemployment after the next it comes to solutions is interviews with a career counselor and a seminar on jobs (or something) Gurwitch attends where, once again, she tells everyone about being fired from a play by that famous director.",1397952000,,1527,4.6716417910447765
8171376,4,B000MRNWQK,"This is a good film on a painful but necessary topic. Getting fired, like near death experiences, teaches you beyond any thing else.",1397260800,,132,4.782608695652174
8171377,3,B000MRNWQK,"FIRED : as a documentary it is poorly structured, as an entertainment work is worthless ( you see a few great answers and fewer comedians ) You will get some ""chicken soup for the soul"" if you are a member of older generation and go through a painful misunderstanding of loss of employment, but like Christ said in the film,in a  younger generation, they expect to have that experience 2-3 times in their life time.  3 stars because of the beneficial effect that it has on healing the feeling of anger in certain groups of people.",1360454400,,530,4.510416666666667
8171378,3,B000MRNWQK,I like the way the subject was present in such a comedic fashion.  The unfortunate reality is that many will experience being fired or laid off from at least one job in their working history.  In this film some of the feeling that a person experiences are brought to light and discussed in a way that you can't help but laugh.  The Mr. Bradley I say thank you!,1356307200,,360,4.264705882352941
8171379,4,B000MRNWQK,"Good for Gurwitch.  Lemons to Lemonade story.  But, yes, I would like a longer film.  I wanted to the hear the celebs  tell their stories.

But I also really liked hearing from regular folk.

Love to see her do more of these regular folk documentaries.

Congrats.",1346544000,,263,4.586956521739131
8171380,4,B000MRNWQK,"A comic tribute to a not-so-funny subject. Annabelle Gurwitch gets people to tell their getting fired stories, and when they are stories about crappy jobs and insufferable employers, it's pretty funny. When it gets serious (people with long-term jobs getting cast off in corporate reorgs while the execs get big bonuses), it's out of its depth. It isn't always the case that losing a job means you're in the wrong one, as Gurwitch seems to believe, yet she includes no stories of those whose lives crashed and burned and never recovered after getting a pink slip.

That caveat aside, there are many laughs to be had in this documentary, and they are often exhilarating. Celebrity interviews include Anne Meara, Jeff Garlin, Tim Allen, and Harry Shearer. Meanwhile, the DVD includes more than an hour's worth of out takes, to show that you can't really exhaust the subject. Should be required viewing for anyone going through job loss; it cuts the trauma down to size.",1191024000,,967,4.896341463414634
