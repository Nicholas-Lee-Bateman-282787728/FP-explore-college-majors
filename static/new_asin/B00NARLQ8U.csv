6621893,5,B00NARLQ8U,"Amazing acting is what drives this mockumentery about one man's experience in the porn industry. As the person attempting to interview him digs deeper we find out he's bitter not only about his former profession but life in general.

He lives in squalor and has turned to drugs and alcohol as crutches to deaden the pain of not being ""Caden Daydream"" the thin ,blonde tan Twink that was a star in the industry when he was 18 through about 20 years old. Now at the still young age of 23 Quinn ""his real name"" is deamed too old and over weight to sell movies as a Twink.

The dialogue and situations become very confrontational and sexual in nature which is riviting to watch. The ending blew me away ,that's all I will say!",1416787200,8,722,4.421052631578948
6621894,5,B00NARLQ8U,"Now 23 and reporting to have retired from the business, former male prostitute Quinn (Wade Radford) addresses an off-screen documentarian's (director Jason Impey) camera and tells the viewer that he began hustling for money in his teens, primarily making gay pornography under the alias Caden Daydream. The trouble was, he didn't always get paid for his efforts.

Quinn lives a drunken, drugged-out existence in a hovel of a flat. His peeling bedroom wallpaper is covered in graffiti which clues us in to both the bitterness that swells inside Quinn, and the swipes that Radford and Impey are having against not only the marketing and digestion of modern media, but the sticky relationship between the filmmaker and his muse: the 'industry' will ""rape you!"", we're told right from the start.

Impey (heard but never seen) points his camera unflinchingly at Quinn as he drinks spirits, utinates, smokes copiously and occasionally passes out. In-between, he coaxes anecdotes from his subject - the more sordid the better, he encourages him - and reasons that he aims to ""dispel myths and rumours"" about Quinn's former profession when the young buck challenges his motives.

Stories of threesomes with hot European men ensue. Initially Quinn seems rather cocksure, his sneer suggesting a brassy refusal to analyse or regret anything that's gone before. But as the alcohol sinks deeper into his system and Impey's quizzing becomes more pressing, the cracks appear: Quinn is suddenly visibly haunted by some of the things he's seen.

This leads to him turning the tables on his inquisitor at one point, before building to a harrowing, unexpected finale that oddly recalls Nekromantik ...

The film is short - 68 minutes - and, in essence, consists of the above content for the bulk of its duration. It's a podium for the musings, rants and despairs of the lead character (and possibly the artist portraying him?) which covers everything from the lie of reality TV and the futility of vanity to the heartbreak of family and how we never truly know who in life is exploiting who.

The script is tight, intelligent and thought-provoking in equal measures, while being sassy enough to offer regular bouts of humour and expletive-riddled shock descriptions.

While Impey does his best behind the camera to keep the documentary questions flowing, this really is Radford's show all the way. A natural actor, he delivers another sincere performance brimming with fury and bitterness and yet always possesses just enough of a defiant smirk, a mischievous glint in the eye, to suggest a hint of optimism required to prevent this from being overly bleak fare.

The minimalist design of the film's look - the filthy, unkempt flat with angry slogans scrawled on the walls in Magic Marker - works to surprising effect. Another asset is Charlie Armour's melancholic piano score. Impey uses it sparsely for maximum impact.

Banned in the UK, it's good to see this troubling film get an uncut DVD release in America.

6621895,5,B00NARLQ8U,"Buyer beware. TWINK is unflinching. Its a gritty  film. Its intimate. It gets you close to the character.and hes demons. The lack of budget adds to the ambience and realism. Most gureilla film making is difficult to watch. Well this movie is too, but not because it doesn't have something to say. It makes you uncomfortable in ways few films do, and that's a testament to the performance of Wade Radford. The young UK actor is a rising star. TWINK ISN'T FOR EVERYONE.  But it's worth it to see the talent in the screen.",1416787200,2,519,4.51063829787234

6621898,5,B00NARLQ8U,"If theres a resurgence in guerilla style indie filmmaking, and I have every hope there is, Ive found the leaders. They are U.K. residents Jason Impey, and Wade Radford. Not only are they leading the charge, they're also the architects of said resurgence. With four films in a matter of two years, and their fifth just completed, Impey and Radford show no signs of slowing down. I was fortunate enough to see a screener of their newest collaboration Twink, and its simply a stunning piece of work.

Filmed in a single day, with just a camera, an actor (well two, though one is an off screen voice), and improvised dialog, and made for almost nothing, Twink belies all the notions of what indie and low budget cinema can be. It is what cinema should be.

Twink tells the story of Kaden, a former adult film actor, who abruptly left the business, and is on a downward slide. Living in a rundown (though rundown is being generous), room, with peeling wallpaper, and graffiti written across, the movie opens with a documentary filmmaker waking him up, because hes late to start their project. Thus begins 68 minutes of Wade Radford giving an absolutely stunning performance. All too often indie movies are dragged down and made insufferable by bad acting, hackneyed writing, and directors who have a streak of self importance. Twink shuns all of that, and shows two artists at work, creating and making statements on society without bashing you over the head.

Filmed as a talking head type documentary, and shot entirely in one setting (with a brief campfire bit which doesnt quite work, but more on that later), Twink could have been a crashing bore. Yet, Radford lights up the screen, not just with his boyish looks and charm, but a wicked smile, and gleaming eyes. Youll want to have your way with him, or smack him, and often at the same time. Radford does such a wonderful job portraying the rakish, downtrodden Kaden (real name Quinn-so he says); that you can almost believe you are watching a documentary. Impeys direction is perfect, and lets the camera act as a fly on the wall, being obtrusive only when necessary. There is a couple of places where the style is broken, such as a drug and alcohol fueled scene where Kaden attempts to seduce the filmmaker, and at the very end, but it works well, and, the film feels cohesive.

If theres anything I have a negative feeling about, its a brief scene shot around a campfire. Theres the clich&eacute;d shot of Kaden, face half hidden in shadow, as he talks about his youth and family, preceded by his reading a poem (which is from Wade Radfords most excellent poetry collection Tough Blows of A Sleepless Universe), which is then burned, and an endless shot of the paper burning. While it was nice to get out of the cramped dwelling Kaden is reduced to living in, it also seemed unnecessary and a bit overwrought. Still, its a very short scene, and it is redeemed by Radfords performance.

As the movie unfolds, you see Kaden become vulnerable, then building his walls back up. It is clear, he trusts no one, and given his past, you cant blame him. The more he drinks and smokes weed, the more delirious he becomes, and that leads us to the inevitable conclusion. I won't say I was surprised by the ending, as I wasnt. However, it was still a very potent and emotional climax, and a payoff-if you can call it that-which works very, very well.

This is not an easy film to watch. Listening to Kadens story, his fall from grace, and bitterness against the world (seemingly blind to his own willing participation), takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Impey and Radford, as with all of their work, pull no punches. This is raw, dangerous work. It has something to say, and says it with a big middle finger to not only the adult film industry but the world of media as well.

I was not overly familiar with their work prior to Twink (though Ive followed Radford on twitter for sometime), but if Twink and the trailers for their other work is anything to judge them by, watch out for these two.",1416355200,2,4044,4.623955431754875
6621899,5,B00NARLQ8U,"Twink, is a fly-on-the-wall documentary, loosely styled on ITVs 7 Up series, where you have the voice of the interviewer, the object of your attention, the interviewee (Kaden / Quinn) and you the viewer, the eyes of the camera. The opening sequence, shows the squalor that Quinn is currently living in, with lots of evidence of drink and drug abuse, which is confirmed later on in the film.

 Kaden Daydream (the porn industry name of Quinn), shows a strong front that he has got his s*** together as the interviewer starts to probe with questions exploring how he got into the Porn Industry and especially why he left. But even though Quinn, shows that he is strong, you can see the emotional pain in his eyes and face which hints at the abuse that he has suffered during this time.

 One of Quinns defence mechanisms is to shock the person who he sees as a threat. Particularly when he perceives them getting close to a truth that he is neither willing to face nor able to deal with. Particularly when you as the viewer can clearly see that abuse has taken place. You, as the viewer also find yourself wishing Quinn to open up and talk about it, just to start the healing process and it becomes almost painful to watch every time he brings the shutters down on you.

 Quinns description of how he was at the bottom of the food chain and everybody else was making money of the back of his works was hard and uncomfortable to listen to, as it shadowed a number of professions in life that do exactly the same thing, not just the sex industry.

 Quinns convincing and damning narrative on how poor the actors really are, as the glamorous lifestyle that they are provided for, which is paid for by others was the only real payment and the moment that you start to lose your Twink looks, is the moment that nobody wants to touch you. Quinn clearly feels hard done by, as everybody above him has made so much money off the back of his labours, whilst he has been left in the gutter.

 It is at this point that you start to see another character appear, the character that is Kaden Daydream. Here, you start to feel that this heart-breaking young man actually has some deep-seated psychological problems. You see Kaden constantly trying to turn the tables on the interviewer, as the film starts to approach the root cause of his pain.

 Again, you see Kaden reverting to type, doing his utmost to shock and manoeuvre the interviewer into a position so he can end the interview and therefore the self-revelations. You also see the true conflict as control of Quinn passes back and forth, just like an emotional tug of war and most shockingly of all to me as a viewer, was the total self-loathing that Kaden/Quinn has for himself.

 The big reveal as to what happened to Quinn is when filming returns and they are sitting outside, next to a camp-fire and Quinn reads some poetry. The story that is being relayed in the poetry is clearly what has happened to Quinn. The Twinky Long Legs poem is upsetting to listen to, but of anything that Quinn says during this film, he is speaking from the heart when he reads that poem. Although, to me, it was shocking when he burned the pages afterwards.

 The interviewer picks up on things that have happened during Quinns childhood and when he starts to question him you see Kaden make an appearance again and you also see that Quinns fall from grace in that industry has left him associating company / companionship with sex.

 It is deeply upsetting to see the Kadens character make a dominant return at the end, particularly when the body dimorphism facet of his personality appears and the resultant conflict between what he feels he should look like and what he actually looks like (bloody good looking and normal, in my opinion), result in so much blood.

 (SPOILER ALERT) It is as this point that I, as a viewer have to state that the film was spoilt for me. Any real documentary maker would not stand there, keep filming and allow the person to effectively kill himself, particularly with a homo-erotic gush of blood. I feel it would have been far more believable if the camera was left with Kaden/Quinn to do his lead out, to film that sequence for himself or if it was a drug & alcohol fuelled fantasy, that Kaden imagines, but later is seen asleep in his bed. But this is only my opinion, others will probably be happy with the ending.

 Overall though, we all deep down know that there is a dark and seedy element in the porn industry where people are used and abused, making other people rich, but when they have reached the end of their very short lived careers, they are abandoned as everyone has got what they want. Wade Radfords acting is very, very realistic in this film and very scary in parts. I feel that this is Wades most important film to date and carries an important social message and commentary.",1413244800,5,4858,4.528

8676937,5,B00NARLQ8U,"Now Twink is a movie that's certainly not for everybody: It's basically a talking heads-mockumentary about a topic (gay porn) what will turn quite a few people off, and while the film's not exactly explicit in its images it is so in its language (heck, even talking about getting one's ass fisted will make a lot of people squirm, regardless of sexual orientation). Plus, the grungy location might be an additional turn-off (though it fits the narrative perfectly).

But that all said, Twink isn't a movie about porn primarily, it's a two-person powerplay between the voyeur (the documentarian) and his object of desire (the ex-porn star), including all the underlying tensions, but also about prejudice and about truth, fabricated by the media - and it's about the exploitation of a human being, that not only happens when it's obvious (like in porn) but especially when it's not (like in a tell-all documentary) ... and all of this is packed into a rather stringent narrative arc, too.

8676940,2,B00NARLQ8U,"""Twink"" is a psuedo-documentary film about a former male porn star (played by Wade Radford) being interviewed (and filmed) by a director who is supposedly shooting a documentary.  We see what the ""business"" has done to Quinn:  he's living in squalor, drinks from morning to morning, smokes dope, and feels sorry for himself.  The viewer never learns how he can keep up his habits, but I've got a pretty good imagination so...  It seems his only coping mechanism--and he uses it quite well--is when he feels cornered or vulnerable he reverts to his old film persona and thinks talking dirty and suggesting things will put him in control again.  He always begins his ritual by taking off his shoes, one sock, getting under the covers, taking his t-shirt off, and pulling at his crotch.  He speaks disparingly about his former job, yet he doesn't seem that interested in getting totally away from it.

I viewed the ""director"" in this film as nothing more than a voyeur--the same way his star did.  He was constantly stating that he wasn't there to ""direct that kind of movie,"" yet he never failed to get as much skin, dirty talk, and implied sex in his documentary as he could.  He wasn't there for anything more than to film his dog-and-pony show.  But what REALLY irked me was this so-called ""shocking"" ending.  I will not give it away, but let me say this:  it was COMPLETELY unbelievable.  Not only that, it took away the gritty, grainy, creepy feeling of the movie and turned it all into one schlock ""I-don't-know-how-to-end-this-so-we'll-do-this."" Did it shock me?  Not in the least.  Did I feel anything for the only character in the movie?  No.  If you know anything at all about the porn business, you are well aware of what it does to most of its participants.

This movie is not rated and is intended for ADULTS ONLY.",1418083200,5,1825,4.685534591194968
