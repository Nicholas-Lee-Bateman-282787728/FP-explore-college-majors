7799534,5,1589850998,"This is a marvelous, insightful look at Alzheimer's from Lisa Cerasoli who did this documentary when she was the caregiver for her grandmother.  Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but is a great look at the disease and being a caregiver.  I attended a workshop that Lisa was the speaker when she wrote the book about her journey with her grandmother.",1451952000,,347,4.864406779661017
7799535,5,1589850998,I use this to teach nurses about Alzheimer's Disease.  Lisa Cerasoli shows the loving care provided to her Gram who is such a beautiful and gracious woman who is trying hard to maintain her identify and integrity during Alzheimer's.  Gram died prematurely but perhaps spared her more difficult days toward the end. Such love and devotion.  Also brings to light the tremendous sacrifices of everyday folks trying to do the right thing.  Our country should be ashamed of the lack of services for older adults with dementia.,1434499200,,521,4.954022988505747
7799536,5,1589850998,"I bought this to help train new staff in the long term care facility I worked in.  I wanted to show the other side of this disease,  the personal side and not just the clinical aspect.  It was well received.",1425168000,,207,4.125
7799537,1,1589850998,"I just watched this film as a presentation.  I understand the purpose of this film, to show the effects of the disease in everyday events. However, at times I feel like the author's grandmother is being exploited in the film.  It seems like people watching this with the author are laughing at the weird things this old lady is saying that she may have not said with all her faculties.  The author even admits off film that she found her grandmother's behavior very entertaining.  She doesn't even know the difference between Alzheimer's disease and Dementia, she can not describe them off camera.

The author, in my opinion, is making too much light about her grandmother's plight.  I don't see the educational value of this. If ""Gram"" was my grandmother, I wouldn't put this out as I don't feel she would have wanted this.  Would ""Gram"" have wanted this, Lisa?  This actually left me more disgusted than anything. Shame on you Lisa.  I hope your daughter doesn't put you on Youtube and record you saying goofy things or speaking as if your deceased husband is still alive if you get this disease...",1400630400,,1100,4.717277486910994
7799538,5,1589850998,"Lisa Cerasoli tells her story of caregiving in truest meaning of the word..................caring for someone you love with Alzheimer's is a challenge and the caregiver has to constantly remind themselves that this is the person they loved for many, many years and now their brain has been ravaged by a horrible disease that has changed them into someone else.",1382918400,2,360,5.11864406779661
7799539,5,1589850998,"I was not sure how this was going to make me feel, considering I watched my own grandmother die with Alzheimers.  As I started to watch the story unfold, mentally preparing to see our experience on film, I was caught off guard by the moments that made me smile and bust out laughing.  The laughter laced with the reality was something that I did not expect.  My regret now is not having seen this film before my own grandmothers struggle.  I think this would have helped us on so many levels in coping and dealing with this dreaded disease.  I hope anyone dealing with a loved one with Alzheimers sees this film.  I'm off to read the book now!  Thanks to Lisa and her family for bringing this highly personal moment for all of us to experience.",1367107200,,744,4.386861313868613
7799540,5,1589850998,"I had the pleasure of viewing this film at the Boulder Life and Death Matters film festival last summer. It is really a beautiful love letter from Lisa Cerasoli to her Gram - and a realistic look at caring for someone with this horrid disease. When life gives you lemons, make lemonades. That's what Lisa did with this film. By capturing Nora Jo's last days with such warmth and humor, it helps soothe the pain of the reality of caring for loved one with Alzheimer's. You have to laugh, or you'll just cry. I have watched this film over and over and over, and recommend it (and the book ""Nora Jo Fades Away"") to anyone currently caring for someone with Alzheimer's, or who has cared for a loved one with this disease in the past. You'll fall in love with Gram, Lisa and her daughter Jazz the first time you see it.
Well done, Lisa, and thank you for sharing your Gram with us. Wish I would have known her.",1329696000,,905,4.329411764705882
7799541,5,1589850998,"I've watched my fair share of documentaries, and I usually end up liking them and learning something...and then I'm happy when they're over. 14 Days w/Alzheimer's leaves you wanting more. It somehow relays all the trials and tribulations that occur with this disease effectively, but does it in such a way that it feels like pure entertainment. I didn't know you could fall so hard so fast for an older woman, the lead, Nora Jo, but this woman endeared herself to me in the first minutes of the show - the whole family did. And I forgot it was low budget, I forgot I was ""supposed"" to be getting an education. The style in which Cerasoli chose to film, made me feel like a fly on the wall. These folks left nothing to the imagination. I feel like I know them now. I feel like I know so much more about Alzheimer's, and I have less fear of the illness. And I feel lucky to have seen this. What a masterpiece! I loved this movie (almost) as much as Nora Jo loved beer!",1329436800,,966,4.284153005464481
