6133012,5,B00H5NY7GI,"I thought this was going to be a cute little movie about life on Shelter Island, NY, which is a beautiful place and no doubt worthy of its own documentary. I was surprised and delighted to find out that while the island itself plays a part in this film, the real joy is watching the developing friendship between the two most unlikely of characters: semi-homeless outsider artist Harald and gas station-owner cum ebay entrepreneur and house builder Jimmy, supplemented by Jimmy's autistic son Alex (a YouTube star in his own right).

It's an uplifting, feel good doc that will appeal to people who want some insight into how a nobody artist can become a somebody artist with Manhattan gallery shows; to people who have autistic family members or friends; and to anyone who is interested in the essential goodness of the human condition. Highly recommended.",1401148800,,856,4.903448275862069
6133013,4,B00H5NY7GI,"The story of Harald Olson appealed to me for many reasons.  First, I love an uplifting true story and this is just that.  Second, I am intrigued by the artistic mind in particular the mind that sees art where others see trash.  And third,  adults with disabilities are near and dear to my heart.  It's so good to see someone being themselves and finding success in it.  And by success I do not mean Harald's rise to NYC art showings.  He is successful because he is happy with what he does.",1400716800,7,490,4.318681318681318
6133014,2,B00H5NY7GI,This documentary was lacking in anything to keep the viewer interested.  It is just going through some typically life situations with some various individuals getting through every day struggles in life.  The people in the story are all very nice and working through their issues.  Not very entertaining though.,1400544000,,311,5.3061224489795915
6133015,5,B00H5NY7GI,"Shelter Island is the heart-warming true story of Shelter Island, NY outsider artist Harald Olson and his passionate patron, Jimmy Olinkiewicz, a gas station owner and father of an Autistic child. The film is an inspirational buddy story that shows how two men, from disparate walks of life can together accomplish an incredible feat; taking an unknown artist from showings alongside a country fence to a major showing in Manhattan art gallery. The film is about kindness, commitment, friendship and inspiration; a small tale with a great big universal story of compassion.

PS: Olson's art is incredible.",1397088000,13,605,5.237113402061856

6133019,5,B00H5NY7GI,"Two beautiful people, the very caring and unique friend Jimmy and the artist Harold, this just shows how we should be, in
helping another. The art of Harold and what emotions he puts into it and the very special friend Jimmy who wants his friend
to be all he can in his art. Two very beautiful people and for all the people who helped Harold to bring about the show.",1428710400,,366,4.242857142857143

6133027,5,B00H5NY7GI,"Good for you, Harold! I wish you the best of luck and wish I could afford a piece of your art. Maybe paint some smaller pieces for us peasants? lol  Keep making your magic!",1410307200,,172,4.0588235294117645

6133032,4,B00H5NY7GI,"Film which captures story of true human goodness and love- Jim O. , who befriends an eccentric artist Harald.  Both men without any pretense or false motives. Intertwined is the story of Jimmy's gifted autistic son Alex. Shelter Island filmed beautifully. The New York art scene ,with all its artifice, shown in sharp contrast  with the genuine nature of the life these men live on Shelter Island.",1402704000,,397,4.91044776119403
6133033,3,B00H5NY7GI,"The movie is good, but it drags on, it could have been made shorter.  Early on in the film, you realize that Harald is unusual and an introvert...it does not have to be continuously addressed.",1402531200,,192,4.485714285714286

6133035,4,B00H5NY7GI,"This story reveals how a person with autism or Aspergers still has abilities pertinent to society and will remove some of the myths some people have in their minds about these conditions. When those with these conditions have a bit of support, (just as everyone needs) they can live a very productive life. The story also shows how the nonjudgmental faithfulness of a true and patient friend helped encourage this artist, resulting in the artist's success. An interesting part of the  story shows how Harold's friend's son who also has Aspergers was able to work in a store simply because the floor color was changed. The psychology of color needs much more publication.
The movie summary should include the artist's professional name - Harold Marinus - as well as his birth name. The art studio has his name as Harold Marinus. He deserves to have his story represent his work in name as well.",1401494400,,893,4.798701298701299

8630239,5,B00H5NY7GI,"Excellent!  As an artist, I found this documentary informative from the creative point; but, also demonstrates that regardless of intellectual ability, serious financial loss, or a diagnosis of autism - one can succeded  - and the success is in the eye of the beholder.",1446076800,,269,5.090909090909091

8630241,5,B00H5NY7GI,"Soooo good!  Not only are the people in this doc fantastic, the movie itself is fantastic.  The pace is perfect, it is always not only keeping your attention but dragging it away from any distraction there may be.  It makes me want to move there and hang out at the gas station :)  Loved it!",1444089600,,291,4.236363636363636
8630242,5,B00H5NY7GI,The simple yet complex world in an artist's life and work are clearly illustrated in this movie. Seeing what good people can achieve working together is a joyful uplifting experience.,1444003200,,183,5.133333333333334
8630243,3,B00H5NY7GI,"Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Personalities are eccentric (as you would expect from the description) and occasionally annoying -- or they would be if you were around them for more than 90 minutes. I'm an admirer of many ""outsider"" artists and artists in general, but when it came down to it, I just didn't like this guy's work. Still, it was a good story that kept me engaged for the most part.",1439769600,,396,4.438356164383562
8630244,5,B00H5NY7GI,"The phrase ""Outsider Artist"" is a really disgusting term for, ""Some painter who didn't go to College"" ..Or,  ""poor, insane, Folk Artist.""  -or- ""some Artist who doesn't have a bunch of rich connections in NYC""  I'm absolutely grossed out this that this phrase is still used.  A great painting is a great painting regardless of who made it.  ""outside"" means.. your not in my group of influence and I can't control you.  Well good for Harald.. do some research on Edvard Munch the first outsider.",1439251200,,494,4.752941176470588
