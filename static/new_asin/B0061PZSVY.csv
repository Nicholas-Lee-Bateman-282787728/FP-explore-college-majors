4927470,4,B0061PZSVY,"A young couple, Kate (who is pregnant) and Jason, move into a new house owned by the husband's parents. In addition to the obvious hazards of such a living arrangement, Kate seems to have some paranoiac issues going on. When Jason's ex-girlfriend shows up, Kate begins to suspect the worst. Her mother in-law only makes things more tense. Then there's Kate's vast doll collection. She has a VERY strong attachment to them, especially the one she calls her ""guardian doll"", It's not long before strange sounds and mysterious occurrences start plaguing the couple. Is Kate's ""guardian doll"" behind the sudden weirdness? What does this all have to do w/ Kate's mother and stepfather? Is Kate's ""hormonal"" state the reason that she's been talking to her doll so much? If Jason's not careful, he just might find out! THE CREEPY DOLL is a low-budget horror film. In spite of its financial constraints, it manages to use a good storyline and decent characters to full effect. Also, allowing us to see through ""doll vision"" is a nice, unsettling touch. Don't go into it expecting explosive action or intense gore (at least, not until the final 20 minutes!), and you just might enjoy it...",1389657600,12,1180,4.875621890547263
4927471,5,B0061PZSVY,"People can act without CGI ! Amazing !! This movie is well worth the time to watch. It is spooky and believable.
I have not seen a home baked movie in a long time. Blair Witch and Paranormal can keep their shaky camera methods. This was very enjoyable. I think they found Chucky's sister and made a movie with her.",1389484800,4,314,4.25
4927472,2,B0061PZSVY,Sorry to say but The Creepy Doll reminded me a high school project.  What I found creepy was the husband looks like the brother of someone from work.  I'd have given it a C for the effort.,1389398400,3,188,4.054054054054054
4927473,1,B0061PZSVY,I like campy films of the horror ilk.  It's kind of a given when it comes to the genre.  But this movie doesn't even qualify as campy.  The acting is so bad.  And none of the characters are appealing.  Not a one.  You kind of root for the doll just to be put out of your own misery.  I actually watched it all the way through but would never recommend this film to my friends.  Not even to my enemies.,1389398400,2,401,3.925

4927475,3,B0061PZSVY,"creepy low-budget film,  good acting and believable sets  - special effects a little weak, also its not the best quality picture- it will not show off  the capabilities of your new high-def TV;  story  moves along well  and most of the scenes and dialogue are logical;  - its a little bizarre and weird  but  check it out --  its much better than many 'big budget' efforts",1388793600,21,372,4.5

4927491,2,B0061PZSVY,"It certainly wasn't the worst Amazon Prime movie I've seen, but it's definitely near the bottom.  Lackluster acting by an overweight cast (was this shot in Mississippi?) was only part of the problem... my biggest issue was the fact that the whole movie seemed slightly out of focus or 'fuzzy', as if there were a filter over the lens or they were shooting through Vaseline smeared glass.  I initially thought it was intentional to indicate past occurrences or something, but the ENTIRE MOVIE made me want to yell FOCUS! repeatedly.  It was like watching a low-def movie from the early 80's.  To top it all off the plot was meh and the ending was no surprise.  I wouldn't recommend it.",1482969600,,684,4.666666666666667
4927492,1,B0061PZSVY,"If you really want a creepy doll story, watch Annabelle. This movie is plagued with dreadfully poor acting, and IMDB showed that the budget was $50,000. That money was probably spent on fast food, because everyone in this movie seems to be about 20 lb overweight. I watched it because my 15 year old daughter read a review of how awful it was, and she laughed through the entire show.

As I have been watching a lot of Prime video movies lately, I am starting to notice that they seem unprofessional and poorly made.",1482624000,,516,4.48936170212766

That's what this movie's vibe is sending out to the audience.  The acting is pretty bad, though, the lead performance is its only saving grace. The Creepy Doll wants to be a psychological horror piece, but it is so slow moving you want to rush to the end just to see if this doll is behind these malevolent acts. If it's a rainy Saturday and you plan on doing nothing all day, go see something else.",1476576000,,523,4.2727272727272725
4927496,2,B0061PZSVY,This movie is meandering and pointless. The leads are unlikable and the supporting cast is atrocious. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the payoff at the end with the doll is hilarious.,1476489600,,204,4.694444444444445

4927545,2,B0061PZSVY,"Blurry, out of focus shots, poor lighting, and washed out color plague this film. It's a shame, because this really takes you out of the experience. The plot is very slow, focusing mostly on the relationship of a young, expecting couple. There aren't many scares to be had in this horror film. The movie only starts getting creepy around the hour mark, but by then it's three-quarters over. This movie tried to do too much at once - if instead it had focused on scarier scenes instead of extraneous plot threads, it would have worked out better. Also, for a film called ""The Creepy Doll,"" it really isn't about the doll at all.",1464652800,,627,4.557522123893805
4927546,2,B0061PZSVY,Doll was cool looking but wished the story went a different direction with her interaction with the doll .. More like trilogy of terror instead.

The only thing Creepy about this movie is that I watched the whole thing,it's like how you cant take your eyes off a terrible car accident. The ONE Good point is the actors, although bad, at least looked like ""Real"" people. No six pack ab Soap Opera looking stud and no hot babes...or even girl next door cute actress in this...Real looking people....who just cant act.

Once it does she happily puts it in what will be her baby's new nursery. Anyone who happens to take a look at Kate's massive collection is immediately freaked out especially by one doll she calls ""her protector"". This doll is indeed very creepy looking and even creeped me out looking at it on the screen. The more her family and friends tell her that they don't like her collection, especially being in the nursery, the more Kate seems to get angry and protective of her collection, almost like a obsession with her.

4927577,2,B0061PZSVY,"I appreciate what they were trying to do with this film, but the execution was all wrong. I can excuse a lot in an indie horror film, i truly can, but this just wasn't very good.
A newlywed couple move back into the husband's hometown, nobody knew the wife, nobody really cared to know her. Immediately she is greeted by a bunch of people talking about his ex-girlfriend and how excited she will be to see him again, and how they always broke up and always got back together. The wife is pregnant and is having trouble fitting in, and loves her doll collection and everyone worries that her dolls will scare the baby. The wife also has this obsession talking about her granny, so get prepared to hear a lot about her granny. The chemistry between the couple is awful, which i'm pretty sure was the point, but eh. The story needed a lot of work, i'm not sure what they were trying to get across to the audience, without spoiling the plot, i understand what happened, i'm just not sure why.  This movie was free on prime, so i didn't waste any money watching it, but i at least wanted to give an honest review of it. The doll was cool looking though, so there's that. I'm glad they got to make their movie, because you can tell everyone enjoyed making it, i just wish they had a better script.",1456617600,,1291,4.3347107438016526

4927610,5,B0061PZSVY,"Let me be at honest as I possibly can: I'm giving this film a 5-star rating because it is so terrible that it's INCREDIBLE.  I would compare this, favorably, I might add, to Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"", in that it's something of a car wreck, but you can't look away.  The acting is hilariously bad.  I watched this film with a couple of friends, and we were completely enthralled.  I will say, the plot is good.  P.J. Woodside, who both wrote and directed this film, did a good job with the storyline, even if the dialogue left much to be desired.  I have no idea who was in charge of the camera angles, but they were terrible. You may be thinking, ""Camera angles? Really? Isn't that nit-picking."" Ordinarily, I would be on board with you 100%, but when camera angles are so terrible that the viewers are having an active conversation about how bad they are, then they're noticeably bad.

I know it sounds like I'm ripping this movie apart, but the fact that the plot is captivating, and that the acting and cinematography is so bad, makes it a must watch, and I highly recommend it to any Amazon Prime user that won't be charged more than their time to watch the movie.  If you're into B-class, check that, C-class ""horror"" joints, this one is for you.

Thank you, P.J. Woodside, for this laughably terrible film.  It was truly entertaining.",1450915200,2,1340,4.522821576763485

Real talent made the first half of this a pleasure to watch (despite the predictably low budget sets and props) and i enjoyed the character driven scenes and dialogue. Original and insightful first half. The only problem is that the plot about halfway through takes a predictable turn into cheesy horror.  I really wanted to see something interesting and unpredictable happen with these characters, something more realistic perhaps?  I actually liked the main character so this end was disappointing.

Terrible acting, stilted dialogue (some of which made no sense at all), weird shots (that are also hazy and grainy) like why are we focused on the back of this lady's neck/portion of this guy's shirt? The plot made little sense and not scary. The creepy doll element was not used successfully. Just for a few examples, everybody thought she was weird for putting all her dolls in the baby's room. Why is that weird or anything to be concerned about? Seems like typical new mom behavior to me. Then a kid is in their house and has an encounter with the creepy doll, she tells the adults the doll spoke to her which the adults take WAY too seriously. We know its true because we're watching a horror movie, but if any of us faced that in real life as these people are supposed to be doing, we would scoff and put it down to imagination.

I agree with one viewer who said that Kate is the creepy doll metaphorically.

4927732,5,B0061PZSVY,"Somebody else nailed it on here, but this movie works because the people and location are not cookie-cutter products, but look and act like the real thing! They are not glamourous people who live in mansions and drive expensive cars; these people live on your street. Several people have mentioned the detached lead female, but nobody has pointed out the obvious: SHE is the creepy doll on display for all to look at, toy with, and scorn! However, every creepy doll has that one person who loves them no matter what (Possible SPOILER unless youve seen the beginning: Grandma). Everyone in this movie does a great job, and Ms. Farleys Kate is downright creepy. She reminds me of Angela Bettis May, the outcast you feel sorry for although you know deep down she has serious issues. Kate desperately wants to fit in, but she cannot. Every newlywed at one time feels a competition into fitting into the new family while being accepted by her spouses family and friends. Add an unborn child and the problems become exponential. Kate needs someone to rely on, and her grandmother is only as close as the phone. Her real solace comes from her guardian doll, which her new family and friends call creepy. Like the doll, Kate wants to take her place with others and be accepted, but thats easier said than done. Yes, the movie is The Creepy Doll. It has a creepy doll in it, but it seems obvious that the doll is so much of a metaphor for what Kate experiences (especially at the end) rather than being a titular boogeyman. The movie is creepy, and although it may not be scary, it is haunting. The budget was not big, but there is a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera. Props to Kristine Renee Farley, Justin Veazey, Steve Hudgins, Cindy Maples as well as PJ Woodside for putting this thing together. Im glad I was able to catch this.

I can tell they had no budget, I can tell they really tried. That doesn't excuse the really poor quality.  The Blair Witch Project was made with no budget also, yet was top grossing film.  This was not shot well, the wardrobe was front eh Walmart $5 sale. The camera quality was worse than a cellphone. The script writing made the nines seem forced. There was so much the director could have done different.  Like go to film school and learn about the art of film making.
1. Use lighting
2. Wardrobe is as important as any other element- think the 6th Sense- the color red keeps appearing as foreshadowing that something isn't right.
3. Have furniture in the houses, the locations looked like cheap furnished rentals or friends houses.
4. Utilize music, the weird dead Goose song was just- weird. Next time have a child hum the tune or something, innocents + horror =creepy.
5. Save for a better camera
6. Work on the script until it flawless
7. The main female character was very good, she could go professional Indie, but the rest looked like the carpool to Circuit City
8. Use some techniques, do flashbacks that show the girl talking to the doll while she hides from her abusive mom or something, the story was not ordered well.

I don't understand how this got on Amazon?  Someone has an uncle working for the company, I mean it was really that bad.
I don't want to talk to the guy who stalks this forum and recommends another movie by the same producer- that is just too weird.
If you want to get better, don't argue with the public, take their opinions seriously and use them to make a better movie next time. Stop trying to justify a really awful movie that looked like a high school production.",1431216000,,1822,4.506060606060606

Even though I was fully invested in this film just to watch one of the stars of the film NONE of the characters were really that likeable at all so it was hard to even give a damn what was going on in these character's lives. I only knew the name's of like two of them...
The acting was decent but suffered from writing and a story that could've been a little more polished pacing-wise.
All in all these people behind this film should be proud of themselves because they were able to complete a full length movie. There are a lot of wannabe filmmakers and ""directors"" out there.

My collection started when I was first born. Most of my dolls are in their original boxes I have a series of dolls that contain dolls from all the countries they are dressed in their native apparel. I won awards growing up for my collection in Girls Scouts. Also when I wrote papers during school for projects I always had a doll I could display with my paper, which was pretty cool. My dolls are all boxed and put safely in my attic. I never heard a doll talk to me. I feel like the young woman in the movie really struggled when she was a young girl and her dolls was really all she had to talk to and confined her secrets to. She was a victim of circumstances which lead her down a path of psychological destruction. I believe the only adult figure who actually treated her as a child was her grandmother, which is sad.  Without loving and nurturing parents she didn't develop mentally proper. As a mother, grandmother, and a foster parent I found her story quite sad.

I found this movie very boring, a little stupid, and it wasn't as much about the doll as it was the woman. She seemed like she was just crazily obsessed over the doll, talking to it, and arguing with it, but the doll didn't really do anything but sit there. It looked creepy and very old, but that's as far as it went as far as the doll is concerned. It is also a VERY low budget movie. The acting is terrible and the story line was a decent enough idea, but poorly executed and left you wanting a better explanation of certain scenes. I didn't think the characters fit the roles they played either. I really think I could film a better movie using a high school drama club and a digital camcorder.

4927905,5,B0061PZSVY,"I'm giving this movie 5 stars, because for a low budget film with unknown actors it was very well done. I've seen other reviews that complain about the acting, but it's not bad acting when they are so accurately portraying their characters. The main character who is a new wife and mother to be from a whirlwind unexpected pregnancy and obligatory quick court house wedding, is very well done by the actress.
She had a difficult childhood, one that would warp the emotional stability of anyone who grew up in such a manner. She had no friends, a stepfather who was likely abusive, a cold uncaring mother who forced her to get rid of the only friends she had in the world as well as her source of security and feelings of protection: The dolls.
The husband, is so typical of a man in this type of situation I was amazed it wasn't based on a true story. I can still remember couples just like this when I was younger and it is perfect in it's portrayal of the man. He tells the girl he loves her, that he married her for love, yet it is plain from the outside looking in that this is not the case. And as seems to be the case in life with men who are unfaithful husbands, they are either very attractive or very unattractive. For people who haven't witnessed this typical happening in their lives, this would seem very unrealistic. But I assure you, it does happen and often. For some incomprehensible reason an unattractive man with a boring personality is somehow the object of attention between multiple women that treat him as if he looked like Brad Pitt.
The nosy mother in law was, perhaps, a bit overdone by the actress. It did come across as flat acting and forced. However, the character itself is, once again, accurate. Typical monster in law that insists on controlling everything, being involved in everything, having to talk to them every single day or she lets herself into their house. And always going on and on about the beloved ex girlfriend.
And speaking of the ex girlfriend, Samantha is just... perfect as a character and the portrayal done by the actress. I hated her from the moment she first appeared. I kept thinking, ""why is he touching this chick so intimately in front of his wife"". There were several times when my first thought was ""oh hell no, if that was my man and this happened they would both be hurting"".

Overall, it was just very well done. I loved the legend behind the doll and it instantly reminded me of how many cultures, especially primitive ones or ancient ones, did not put faces on dolls so that any spirit could possess them and use it as a body. And then the ending made me question who Granny was and what her story could be. Honestly if they made a sequel that was all about Granny's back story I would watch it 100%.",1415836800,,2766,4.455621301775148

4927962,2,B0061PZSVY,"it's not so bad.  The acting isn't the best, but by far it is not the worst I've seen, and I've seen a LOT worse.

The overall storyline is actually, imo, fairly decent.  The Guardian Doll concept is one I really like.

Likes - the Guardian Doll
  - the vast collection is really cool to look at and makes for a great backdrop in any scene
  - the actors aren't terrible, and to have ""real-looking"" people is a nice change of pace from movies where everybody is make-up'd to within and inch of their lives
  - the flashbacks including the lead's grandma to give a backstory

Dislikes - the Guardian Doll was not very ""active"" in this film.  I expected it to be and I think that was potential that was wasted
  - I did not feel any chemistry between any of the actors.  Altho their acting was okay for an Indie, the leads should have had some chemistry.  I simply could not buy the two married people.  They felt to me like they were told, ""You're married and in love,"" and that was it.  I never felt the love or bought it for a moment.
  - the ending.  While I don't mind ""try to figure it out"" endings, sometimes enough is enough.  Unless I was severely out of it that day I saw several possibilities of what actually happened.  When I re-watched it again, I still had no real idea.  To me that is more either lazy story-telling, or the writer/s tried so hard to have a ""twist"" that it wasn't done well enough to make it thru to the viewer.  I may be alone in this, but I doubt it.

Spoilerish -

Was possession involved?  I'm not sure.  It seems so, but maybe not.  If it was possessed, why didn't it DO more?  Or move more?  If it was a guardian and had its own intelligence, the same questions still stand.

Did it have real power at all?  Did the killings occur because of the doll directly, or because it could manipulate the mind of another?  And if it had THAT power, why use a human vessel, especially if it is supposedly a Guardian and meant to protect?  What if who it was protecting was much larger and stronger than the one it is supposed to guard?

My question of whether it had real power or not will be explained by the movie's ending.  I like the ending if it is what I think it may be, but again, I'm not sure WHAT to make of the ending, so that spoiled the film for me!

Honestly, I want to give this three stars, but the ending knocked a star off for me.  I don't mind figuring things out, but you have to have something to go on and I don't think there was quite enough.  One or two more little clues would have helped and I would have given it another star - perhaps 2.  I was entertained, tho, and watched it in one sitting.

But as it stands now, I don't know if I'll ever watch this again.  I can't recommend it unless it is to show someone an Indie movie with potential to be more if a few things were tweaked a bit more and if the actors can project more chemistry to get you to care about them more and believe their professed feelings towards each other.",1406332800,3,2983,4.13986013986014

It was interesting to see how the story evolves but there were times when it could have been better paced.

I think also we are use to superbeautiful creatures on screen and not your normal everyday looking people, and this was set in small town america with people that actually look like what you see in REAL life in these locales.

The reason why I gave it three stars is because I was looking for a horror movie...and this movie is not a horror movie.  It is more a psychological movie that has some violence at the end.  Most of the movie deals with the pregnant girl's insecurity when she finds out her husband--who married her because he knocked her up--used to be engaged to a family friend.  She has entered a tight knit family and group of friends that have known each other for years.  She is also dealing with memories of being sexually abused, which seem to be worse now that she is pregnant.  And everybody is creeped out by her collection of dolls--particularly the doll shown on the cover--which her mother forced her to pack away (which she resents).

Though they show the doll's face changing at the end, the doll really doesn't do much.  If you are looking for a movie about a doll that walks around with a knife, saying, ""I'm Chatty Kathy, and I don't like you!""  This movie isn't it.",1399852800,,1241,4.491071428571429

Most of the times the Indy movies bring the best of the actors, this is one of those times. The actors, as well as the directing, writting, script and just about everything else, didn't have much to envy from those high budget excessively commercial films. Very entertaining, edge of your seat watching story and most pleasing for me is that is not too predictable. Is an old theme, about an evil doll that has a mind of its own and it manipulates who ever owns it (or perhaps the owner permits to be manipulated) and is very jelous and bad-tempered, but is one of the best versions of an old theme that I've seen.",1398124800,2,702,4.285714285714286

The only thing that distinguishes this from a high-dollar production is the low budget they had to work with - other than that, the acting is excellent - perhaps even better than professional big-name actors and actresses who ""try too hard.""  The woman who plays the psycho is so realistic that I have to wonder if she's not nuts and creepy in real life!  If she's a sweetheart in real life, then she deserves an academy award.  It's the humdrum neighborhood and typical mundane setting that makes this movie very interesting - everyone will recognize it from real life.  The rest of the cast is very good too.  The plot is decent ... the doll is out of the Seinfeld episode, so that actually gives the movie an added amusement factor, and there can't be anything wrong with that!

I feel that a higher-budget would have made things better and, perhaps given the producer a longer time frame to work with and use that to make the movie more suspenseful or have more character development.

The actors could be better, but they're decent. I didn't feel much connection between any of them or with any of them, but they weren't horrible. The plot line is good, but I thought a bit too obvious what was going to happen. Maybe they could have had it a little less clear for a while. There due to acting, lines, and camera angles, it is a little to clear as to who's behind the mysterious happenings and the events at the end (can't say too much for fear of spoilers).

4928110,4,B0061PZSVY,"This is not what views anticipated it to be, therefore they were let down. In my opinion, this movie was meant to be similar to the 1988 movie Pin. Although not well known, it was a fantastically well made psychological thriller based around an inanimate object which in the case of Pin was a medical dummy. Both character's psychological abnormalities where in turn helped to foster due to the early introduction of both the doll, and the medical dummy in either case.

This movie's entire reasoning in creation was to put the main female's psyche on exhibit. Nothing more, nothing less. The somewhat odd situations regarding what the doll ""saw"", or ""said"" were introduced in order to detract from the fact that the film makers were unsure if they could get any viewers to enjoy the film if it were PURELY psychological. Of course they would be required in their minds to incorporate a creepy doll whispering to a little girl.

This didn't cost me anything extra to watch as a Prime member, and the picture of the creepy doll intrigued me, so I thought I'd give it a try.

I wasn't disappointed, although my husband seemed a little upset that it wasn't very scary. That didn't bother me. I thought the actors did a great job - except for the one love scene between the husband and his old flame - that seemed a little too fake and contrived.

The acting wasn't as bad as it could have been, but it's still pretty bad, some characters are worse than others.  The unleashing of passion in the office was hilarious.

The plot of the doll itself builds up until the satisfying climax at the end.  This isn't some slasher campfest.  This is a psychological thriller that is well worth the money and time to see it.  Smartly written and the cast of characters assembled do a great job, especially the above mentioned Kristine Farley, Steve Hudgins, Jessica Cook, Randy Hardesty, Cindy Maples, and that uber creepy guy taking pictures at the school yard, James Gibbs.

Wrapping a movie around a ""creepy"" doll is not new, who hasn't seen the ""Chuckie"" series but in this case doing production in the county adjacent to where I grew up made it worth the effort to watch another doll-oriented production to see what local sites and talent I might recognize.

I liked that the actors were regular looking people, they were relatable, and the main actress along with the story flow and points of view does a good job of going from reserved to unhinged as more is revealed, and adds that dangerous element that had me talking back to the characters in the movie, ""No! Don't do it!"" The doll is a creepy sidekick or familiar, like ""Twilight Zone's Talky Tina, but doesn't get into camp by talking out loud and skittering about the house or anything. Just a good level of creepy.  Overall, I liked it so much, I'm going to look up the production company's other movies, ""Widow"" and ""Lucid.""",1390521600,6,819,4.375
4928164,1,B0061PZSVY,"I did not enjoy the content or the story line. I guessed the ending in the first 10 minutes of the movie. For the most part it seemed like
a not very creative overdone version of Chucky. The Characters were not well drawn and hard to relate to since they were all villans.",1390521600,2,272,4.150943396226415
4928165,2,B0061PZSVY,"In spite of a very amateur/film club feel, The Creepy Doll gets points for effort, I see the intent, the final product just didn't quite get there and ends up more odd than creepy.",1390435200,2,180,4.323529411764706
4928166,1,B0061PZSVY,"I was actually looking forward to this - the concept appealed to me. The acting, however, was so bad that it was distracting. The doll was indeed creepy but so was the lead actress' performance.",1390435200,2,194,4.571428571428571
4928187,4,B0061PZSVY,"This movie may have been a low budget film but it was well done.  The actors all did a fine job and the story was told well.  One thing I thought could have made the doll a bit more creepy would have been better special effects, but I guess they did what they could.",1390348800,3,266,3.9074074074074074
4928188,1,B0061PZSVY,"I don't know how anyone was able to sit through this flick without falling asleep. I dozed off three times and decided to stop the movie and find something else. This story idea has surpassed it's zenith. A doll that kills to protect it's beloved owner, with a mug that only it's owner could love.",1390348800,2,297,4.418181818181818
4928189,5,B0061PZSVY,"Wow, I'm not sure what was creepier - that freaky doll or the wife.  She was an entire psychological convention's worth of material there.  Loved this movie.",1390262400,3,157,4.777777777777778
4928190,5,B0061PZSVY,"Yes it's low budget. At first I almost turned it off when I saw just how low budget, and that the actors are all unknowns. BUT I was quickly impressed w/ the very good acting.  No they aren't Hollywood idols, they look like real people, and they talk and act like real people too.

If you liked the little-known movie Pin, (which is a hidden gem), you'll like this one.  Give it a chance!! Get over your prejudice against low budget movies, and you will be rewarded with a finely-acted movie with a great build-up of tension.  Yes it's somewhat predictable, but for this one, the story is in the telling.  Very well done.  The lead actress is superb, hope to see more of her.",1390176000,2,675,4.36
4928191,5,B0061PZSVY,"Fantastic film!  This one was especially ""creepy"" for me, as I was one of the residents in the house where ""creepy doll"" was filmed.  Viewed the film right in the living room, with that hallway a few yards away from the sofa.  Lived with that creepy doll bedroom for months.  Truly heart palpitating every time I walked by that bedroom.  And by the way, who are those people in our bed???????  You have to see this film....unforgettable and astonishingly creepy.  Amazing cast!",1390176000,2,477,4.7439024390243905
4928192,5,B0061PZSVY,Awesomely scary! Its so original and the actors were great. I so recommend watching the other movies in the Big Biting Pig series. Kudos to Pj Woodside.,1390089600,4,152,4.666666666666667
4928193,4,B0061PZSVY,"enjoyed it:  the creepy doll was better than a lot of higher budget horror movies.

would like to see other movies from the director of this.",1390003200,2,141,4.384615384615385
4928194,1,B0061PZSVY,"Okay, I am 45 minutes in and I want to through my tv outside and set it on fire. I kinda want to find these ugly actors and punch them in the face. This movie was made with someone just holding a video camera. Writing this is making me more angry about it because nothing is happening still. I would rather watch squirrels do it on the Discovery Channel. Do boy squirrels have balls? I guess I never really checked. Maybe next time I see one I will take a look under its tail. Terrible quality with horrible lighting and awful sound. Who the hell rated this up to 4 stars? You obviously are wasting your life with stupid movies and your existence in this world bothers me.",1390003200,3,672,4.2578125
4928195,5,B0061PZSVY,"The lower rated reviews for this film seem to think a character driven horror movie must be ""campy"" to be good. That their expectations were not met does not surprise me. THE CREEPY DOLL is not campy. It's a serious film about an extremely trouble young woman that happens to be many months pregnant, and her ""guardian doll."" Definitely not a gorefest,THE CREEPY DOLL is a methodically built psychological horror-thriller, an excellent example of Regional Film Making, distinguished in that it is the result of a singular creative vision, conceive and executed with disarmingly twisted care by writer-director PJ Woodside. Don't expect a formula horror pic. Woodside takes time to build credible, consistent characters, while, at the same time, revealing the troubling circumstances that exist between this newly married, soon to be mother and father. Woodside takes for granted that her viewers will pay attention and respond to the gradual, disarmingly realistic way the crisis at the heart of this marriage is revealed and, in the final shocking act, resolved.  The film's low key development makes what happens, if one pays attention, jolting because it's all very realistic and believable; there are none of the regular horror movie short cuts to be found in the low budget slasher pics, that actually try to be campy but usually just end up stupid and not particularly funny. The leading actress, Kristine Farley, gives a performance that creeps up on you. What at first seems modest and self effacing in this mother-to-be becomes, by degrees almost impossible to detect, something else entirely. This may not be your typical horror-thriller, but that, I contend, is what makes it rather special and well worth your attention.",1389916800,19,1732,5.1637010676156585
4928196,5,B0061PZSVY,My daughter and I loved it. We will recommend to others especially those with an interest in movie making. Good story that kept you interested.
