My husband and I made a trip to Pecos, Texas a couple of months ago, and on the drive home,  passing through Odessa, I remembered the story about Jessica McClure and decided right then and there to order the movie. The movie was very well put together and I'm so glad I now have my own copy.",1438905600,,460,4.032967032967033

8454127,5,B0052QF5TI,"This is a made for TV movie and it is so well done. If it didn't have the happy ending, which the watching audience knows about in advance, no one would watch it. But, fortunately, this real life story did turn out the way it did although it easily might not have. Everyone was well cast and it can be enjoyed by all generations. I recommend it highly.",1392163200,,352,4.1911764705882355
