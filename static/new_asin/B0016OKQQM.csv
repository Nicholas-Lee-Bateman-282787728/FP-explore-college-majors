For Christians it brings a deeper understanding of what Jesus accepted to live by grace and will increase an experience of it deep in one's own spirit.  Includes the use of crucifixion by governments both before and after Jesus' times as well.

3162167,5,B0016OKQQM,"Unlike many documentaries that consist of talking heads in a static camera shot, this is a History Channel film that can be used in class without boring one's students to death -- no pun intended. As it explains the historical origins of crucifixion as a form of punishment, the film displays and excellent use of CGI special effects and brief (somewhat bloody) reenactments to illustrate what's being discussed. The film covers the ancient use of crucifixion among the Greeks and Romans, featuring the crucifixion of Christ and the crucifixions under Nero in the AD 60s that presumably claimed the life of the Apostle Peter, although the film does not mention him specifically. It continues with a consideration of different forms of crucifixion -- essentially hanging someone on a tree or pole, not necessarily a cross -- during the Middle Ages and more recently by the Nazis in the extermination camps of the Holocaust. Most fascinating, and worth the price of purchase alone, is an extended look (in the popular style of Myth Busters and other scientific ""infotainment"" shows) at the physiological strain of crucifixion on human test subjects and a consideration of what caused the death of Jesus of Nazareth as described in the Christian gospels. (The film has a surprising and plausible answer to the latter question.) All in all, this is the best short documentary on crucifixion you will find, and is ten times better than ""The Execution of Jesus"" DVD from A&E/History Channel that is still floating around from the 1990s. The latter is an excruciatingly dull, sneering, and pedantic series of static religious art overlayed by interviews with smarter-than-thou scripture scholars who deconstruct the Biblical accounts for the sake of advancing their own scholarship rather than illuminating anything worth learning. This newer documentary offers more facts than theories, theories that are tied to scientific and historical facts rather than to ideological bias, and provocative visuals that are stop just short of being too sensational. This film is more in the recent History Channel style of tightly edited, slick visuals with hard-hitting theories and tasteful analysis than in the 1990s History Channel style of self-righteous talking heads. You'll learn more from this film in a short time than you will from reading many books written by many postmodern Christian and Jewish scriptural theologians who do more to confuse than to clarify our understanding of ancient history.",1382227200,,2490,5.243107769423559

3162169,5,B0016OKQQM,Very well done doumentary on the crucifixion. Learn alot from watching which I never knew and goes way back in time to show how crucifixion came to be.

3162171,4,B0016OKQQM,"It was around Easter when I saw this history channel documentary discussing one of the supreme symbols of man's inhumanity towards his fellow men.  This is not a program for those easily disturbed by depictions of violence and I would not recommend it to anyone with a hint of sadistic tastes.
The documentary follows the cruel punishment from Assyrian, some Persian, and Macedonian forerunners.  Most of the documentary focuses on Roman crucifixion (especially Christ's crucifixion but also Spartacus's Rebellion, Varus putting down a Jewish revolt, Nero's persecution of Christians, and the fall of Jerusalem).  Finally the martyrdoms of Japanese Christian converts in the sixteenth century, Nazi concentration camp hangings, and the genocide in Darfur are mentioned.  Also mentioned are the symbolic uses of the cross ranging from a symbol of Christian love to the terror symbol of the kkk.
Left out are a number of post-Roman European uses and the extensive Islamic use of crucifixion (though Darfur is mentioned) and likely a number of others.
The actors and make-up team did a good job at hammering their point home and the reinactments are rather disturbing to watch.  The opinions of the medical experts seemed very plausible.  I should mention that some of the historical battle scenes come from other history channel documentaries but they are generally put in effectively.
Overall, a brutal but informative account of a symbol of both sacrifice and human evil.  A friend of mine who saw the program agreed that it was interesting but very graphic.  This is certainly not for everyone.",1218412800,12,1595,5.203125

8263713,3,B0016OKQQM,"I really wanted to give this 3.5 stars but that was not possible. I think it is more than just ""It's okay"" but less than an endorsement of ""I Liked it"".
I also must say that the trailer, which I saw some months ago on YouTube, was a bit more startling and scary. HOWEVER, do not let this opinion keep you from viewing the movie. It is scary. Just not on a level with other demon possession movies like ""The Exorcist"" or ""Possession of Emily Rose"". This is more about one woman exploring the faith she lost when her mother died. The protagonist in this film is a jaded reporter who is bent on proving that religion is blinding others to what is really going on in the world. Her vendetta against religion is actually blinding her to certain truths. Her bitterness over her mother's choices and death have polluted her to the point of being very nonobjective as a reporter and filling her reports with bias of her own making. She is researching the crucifixion and subsequent death of a nun in a small town that still is steeped in it's old time superstitions. She meets her match in a very faithful priest and their arguments about religion are really the crux of the film. The more horrific things that occur (mostly in flashback as villagers and fellow nuns tell the reporter what they observed. Some of this is very frightening and as things begin to happen to the reporter that she cannot explain away by logic, it becomes even more so. While if found myself aggravated by the stubborn stance of the reporter I still did not want anything bad to happen to her. The performances are very good especially those of the priest, the reporter, and the deceased nun's friend and fellow nun. One of the most disturbing and terrifying events occurs right at the start as a group of persons are carrying a writhing and screaming woman into a chapel and begin the exorcism. The debates over religion verses disbelief in God and religion (the reporter basically feels that religion makes about as much sense as the villagers belief in say vampires and werewolves) are not preachy but thought provoking. As someone who has little patience with those who have to run about pronouncing their faith in everyone's face, asking What Would Jesus Do?,"" and proclaiming ""Well I'm a Christian and...."" rather than LIVING their faith by demonstrating good works instead of just talking about it, I found the discussions interesting and, like the court scenes in ""Emily Rose"", just presenting the characters thoughts and beliefs without beating the audience over the head to believe one way or the other. Good movie, Just not as scary as the trailer led me to believe.",1520467200,4,2647,4.670235546038544
