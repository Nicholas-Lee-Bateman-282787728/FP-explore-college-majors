The storyline was a little confusing as to what the aliens were and why they were using the young couples for their experiments. The filming was alright, and most of the film took place in an abandoned old storage/warehouse. Most of the filming was done in a darker setting and the mood was somewhat claustrophobic. the actors and actresses did a fantastic job of their lines and roles. the actresses were very attractive, and did most of their scenes while barely dressed. One thing that i found amusing was that more and more of the horror films feature actors using cell phones inside buildings and out in the boonies. when they are able to get reception they make really stupid calls and are always unable to get any help. This movie had several scenes where you have to wonder as to why they could not free themselves early in the game. This movie i am sure would be liked by both guys and gals, very suspenseful, scary, and a little on the gory side.",1381449600,,1039,4.473684210526316
5860050,1,B00DW5IKJ8,"This is a sad attempt.  Concept could have worked but the writing and directing were apparently done by Jr high school students.  Nope, actual adults put this on film...sad.  The actors themselves not horrible. Their performance was not bad considering the lack of material with which they had to work.",1379635200,,302,5.0
8598480,1,B00DW5IKJ8,"Too much down time. Not enough going on to keep my attention. Too many weird/unnecessary interactions between abductors and abductees. **Spoiler: Why leave them half naked and restrained, only to then knock them out with gas five minutes after they wake up and take the restraints off, and then ten minutes later attack them and drop off their clothes? Why not just leave them clothed and unrestrained if that was the end result. Too many unanswered questions were left by the end of the movie. Honestly, I am pretty much clueless as to what was going on overall. **Spoilers: What were the surgeries for? How did the main woman character have a baby in three months? Why were the abductors sick? What were the main characters doing at the end driving around with the baby and both of them clearly now sick? Basically, don't waste your time. Glad I rented it for only $1, and didn't waste $3.99.",1451001600,,894,4.6645569620253164

8598482,4,B00DW5IKJ8,"I liked. It was a thriller with a twist. Kept me wanting to watch more and see what was going to happen. Acting was good, you can't be to picky with a movie that wasn't in theaters I gave it a four stars because I am just a little confused with the ending of the movie.",1422748800,,269,3.8214285714285716

8598484,3,B00DW5IKJ8,"This movie was not all that and a bag of chips.  It was a pretty good movie, but not to own (I had to buy it so that I could write a paper about it for a compare and contrast.)  So if you don't have to write a paper, just rent it.",1396396800,,230,3.4038461538461537
8598485,5,B00DW5IKJ8,"Abducted is an exhilarating thriller with a hip edge.
 The story line takes you on a suspenseful ride, all within an eery decrepit building.
There were nuances that seemed questionable but were never left un-answered taking you to these great a-ha I get it moments. I really felt for the characters too, the acting was very believable.
The ending was quite a surprise too. Cudos to the smart directors. I would definitely see more of their films!
I highly recommend this film",1395187200,,475,4.7926829268292686
8598486,4,B00DW5IKJ8,"An ongoing suspenseful thriller with an edge and a  twist!
Will keep you on the edge of your sofa throughout the film.
Great soundtrack too!",1389398400,,140,4.6
8598487,5,B00DW5IKJ8,"wow, just watched Abducted, way scarier than the ""critics"" think. I enjoyed the movie, was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Keeps you wondering what is going on the whole time and has a cool twist at the end.  Watch it!",1389398400,,225,4.113636363636363
8598488,4,B00DW5IKJ8,"We rented Abducted the other night and were pinned to our seats within a couple of minutes. What happens totally kept us off-balance the whole time.  We were scared every time the lights went out. Tessa Ferrer (from Grey's Anatomy) is amazing.  Trevor Morgan has real charm.  Loved watching them try to figure out what is happening to them.  There aren't many Sci-Fi movies these days that feel this unique, and aren't written by committee of studio executives. Hey and it won best SciFi film at Shriekfest.  A definite two thumbs up.",1387843200,,534,4.760869565217392
8598489,2,B00DW5IKJ8,"The first thing about the DVD you notice is the stand out green color which matches the font in the film title. This color doesn't tie into anything else, but hey, it was eye catching. Dave (Trevor Morgan) and Jessica (Tessa Ferrer) are having their pre-marriage honeymoon in California when wouldn't you know it, they get abducted by men disguised with international orange protective clothing with respirator masks. Dave was able to get off a distress notice which only leads to more people coming to the same area in hopes of getting abducted too. They believe it is aliens. None of the couples abducted include Randy Quaid, clearly a missed opportunity for the casting director.

The rest of the film shows our couples having implants put in them and being operated on. Actually the low budget doesn't show it happening, just the large black stitches that went out in the 80's. Like so many abduction films it is consumed with dealing with imprisonment, trying to escape, and figuring out what happened.

I became bored with the film. The ending needed to be more toward the middle. The mystery aspect didn't work well as we needed to see things from the captors side to make it interesting.

Mediocre rental.
