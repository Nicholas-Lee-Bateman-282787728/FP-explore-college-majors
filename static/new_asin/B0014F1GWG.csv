8658188,1,B0014F1GWG,"Seriously, I pride myself in being the one, even if no one else is, to usually be able to find something of slight worth in almost any movie, but wow...first off, the synopsis is merely a fractionated blip of the actual plot (?) of the movie...which isn't about a lesbian relationship incurring the drama of bringing about a child into the picture, but instead, a highly manipulative and controlling psychotic woman who hates all men after having been raped by her stepfather at a young age.  She does allow her girlfriend to pursue the means towards conception, but once that happens and the girlfriend doesn't want to break it off with the new man in her life, Ms. Psycho morphs into a homicidal sociopath leaving a new body behind her wherever she goes.  Enter into the picture, the naive police investigator who she wants to hate enough to murder, but he just isn't like any other man she's ever met...and although you can presume the ending from here, I can guarantee you that you're wrong.

I can't say that it wasn't semi-predictable once the blood started flowing, and laughable, because the plot was as far out there as her sociopathic personality.  I did manage through it to the end, but after the first 40-45 minutes or so, I had accepted the fact that it was for the sheer pleasure of watching...well, just a really, really bad movie.  So bad that as I'm shaking my head and laughing at the ending, I knew I it was my obligation to warn the innocent.  Lesbian romance it's not, lot's of straight pseudo-sex and nudity but nothing to impress.  Simply your basic repressed rape-victim slasher movie with subtitles, on the far (far) end of the B scale.",1214524800,3,1662,4.651877133105802
