8539991,5,B009D4GMRY,"Exceptionally fun, delightful (and very funny) rendition of these stories by Holly Hunter with inventive, wonderful musical accompaniment by Art Lande, Paul McCandless and others.  Highly recommended effort from Rabbit Ears productions, I could not disagree more with the negative reviews posted here, this one has been treasured by every kid that I've seen listen to it.  Grownups too, at least the ones I know.",1487462400,,412,5.323076923076923

8539993,5,B009D4GMRY,"I grew up in the 90s when Rabbit Ears Productions aired on PBS. This particular title was my absolute favorite in the series (and trust me, it's hard to pick if you're a fan!) Holly Hunter's splendid narration gives the stories a modern, playful feel while keeping true to the integrity of the original tales, coupled with funky, fun music and charming illustrations. I'm so pleased that the series is now available on Amazon and cannot recommend it enough, whether you're looking for something to share with kids or just relive childhood yourself :)",1463529600,,550,4.861702127659575
