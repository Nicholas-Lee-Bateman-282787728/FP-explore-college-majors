2692129,5,B000KJU1FU,"This set does something very unusual for documentaries, particularly Hitler Channel productions, these days:  It goes out and shows you the constructions that it's talking about (and a striking number of these ancient engineering feats remain in show-and-tell-able condition).  Oh, there are computer-graphic explanations of details -- for example, the Aztec aqueduct system or the process by which boats were moved along Darius's canal.  And some fairly restrained re-enactments provide a bit of action, as well as historical context.  Otherwise, though, lovely images of the actual objects at issue form the centerpiece(s) of each segment.

Peter Weller's purposefully conversational narration lapses only occasionally into dude-speak, and anyway, he can be forgiven a snarky comment or two while he gamely climbs up, down, in, over, under and through the assembled relics of the human past (in their varied states of disrepair).  He certainly generates an infectious enthusiasm for his subject, and he communicates quite a bit of information in an accessible manner.

I might have liked to see more technological nitty-gritty on some of the innovations, but in general, this series has rather more heft than one might expect from the mainstream infotainment production houses.  I, too, am slightly irritated that the Rome volume will be a separate purchase -- but I'll be picking it up, just the same.",1187740800,2,1404,5.408256880733945
2692130,5,B000KJU1FU,This digital video disk collection was very interesting. I was amazing by the developments of the Mayan and the Aztecan empire. I surprised to see that of my anthropology professors appeared in the one of the digital video disks. I liked how the narrater should enthusiasm which kept me awake throughout the documetary. I only wish the Egyptian Empire was included in the set. I'm thinking about ordering that one in the future.,1180656000,,428,4.876712328767123

2692161,4,B000KJU1FU,"Just two comments on this informative and well done series. 1. For those of us with failing hearing, their insistence on playing dramatic music over key dialogue is maddening. Frequently, commentary is provided by experts with accents that require extra attention; why do they turn up the volume of the music at those very moments? 2. Their explanation of water pressure (in the Mayan Empire) is appallingly flawed.

2692207,2,B000KJU1FU,"Constantine the Great was a Roman Emperor from his ascension to his grave.  He established his capital, New Rome, on the site of the town of Byzantium, on the edge of and in Europe. His empire was the Roman Empire and it endured as such until his city Constantinople fell in 1453, Friday April 6.  Note that this is just under 40  years before Columbus landed in the Americas, but western historians and this program claim that the Roman empire fell in the fifth century.

Well into the 20th century, the Christian peoples of the great city Konstantinoplis and in Asia minor, were called by others and themselves Romiosini and Romaioi - the people of Rome.  To this day, the Orthodox Christian peoples of the middles east are called the Ruom Orthodox.

EnE makes incessant references to the ""Byzantine Empire"", the Byzantines, the Byzantine emperor. They nor anyone in those times ever called them such.  It was always the Roman Empire, the Romans, and the Roman emperor.  The term ""Byzantine Empire"" was introduced by western writers, notably Gibbon, having various agendas to try to negate the legacy of Roman Empire in the Christian eastern Mediterranean basin.

The conquering Sultans adopted the Roman Christian symbol of the crescent moon as their own and they fashioned their mosques after the style of the great temple of Hagia Sophia.  The crescent in Christian symbology represents the Mary the Mother of God who reflects the uncreated light of her Son, the Sun of Righteousness.  Crosses fixed atop crescents are common on the domes of the temples where Orthodox Christians worship.

It's beyond hope that this episode would ever be recast to correct it's many errors.  Shame on H/C for the lack of fact checking and for its lazy approach to this topic.

They were very informative and comprehensive. Especially the concept of
Arches and Aquaducts by the Romans.

One shortfall i had was that the DVD is missing SUBTITLES. I find it

when they are explaining the engineering concepts.

surprised and deeply dissapointed by the missing subtitles.",1371340800,23,509,4.839080459770115

2692240,1,B000KJU1FU,"Based on the reviews I greatly anticipated viewing this DVD, but I was instead very disappointed. Sorry Peter Weller - his hosting is more robo than cop. He sounds like they gave him a script and he managed to memorise and practice the pronunciation, but there is such a lack of passion or interest from him in what he is saying it bodes ill for the rest of the presentation.  (Also he is listed as being from Syracuse University - what does that mean?)  The other expert is from Focus Magazine. Not sure what that means either.

The real trouble is that there is very little engineering - there is a lot more re-creations of people walking around the Parthenon, or Romans doing battle (by the way all the armour is shiny and the costume design - some things do not fit the actors - notably Alex the Great is seen wearing a toga that looks like one of the big suits worn by the Talking Heads). There are a couple of so called animated blueprints - but they do not  deal at any length with the mechanics of the thing they are describing . Fully three quarters of each segment is Peter Weller suddenly appearing from behind a rock to say something dramatic, a few talking heads (lower case) to talk about the person who they say caused the engineering marvel we are about to see, dramatizations of men pulling ropes, or sandaled feet on rocky ground, or more men and sometimes women, standing around pointing at something in silent conversation with others, or gazing forlornly at some distant horizon.

No visuals of the actual implements which are ensconsed in museums around the world, no craftsperson to re create some of the techniques, no engineer to recount any of the engineering principles.  Instead lots of redundant visuals and redundant and not very forthcoming narration.

The DVDs are only good for people who might want something similar to a Judge Judy introduction to law.",1327104000,12,1887,4.631736526946108
2692241,4,B000KJU1FU,"Leaving the dusty history books behind, ENGINEERING AN EMPIRE takes to the streets -as well as the sewers, mountaintops, jungles and beyond- to trace the magnificent physical achievements and technologies of past societies. Host Peter Weller travels around the world and, assisted by cutting-edge computer renderings and note-perfect dramatizations, far back in time to chronicle the innovation and architectural brilliance that gave birth to modern civilization. Experience street-level life in ancient Greece and China; track the expansion of history's most ambitious cultures like Rome and Byzantium; and marvel at the touchstone achievements -the Parthenon, Tenochtitlan, the Great Wall, Chichen Itza, and many more- that defined the past and awe us to this day. Computer enhancements and location filming transport you to the very sites where empires thrived and collapsed. ENGINEERING AN EMPIRE breathes life into the past, reanimates the achievements of the history's greatest civilizations, and illuminates the ingenuity and boldness of our forebears.

This show is amazing !! If, like me, you buy a lot of DVDs about History then this set is a must-buy. Everything about this show is great, but the most interesting aspect is how much information is given to us in every episode. It's fascinating to learn about all the important Emperors, how these civilizations evolved, how so many of these civilizations changed the course of history.....

The host, Peter Weller (Robocop !), is great. The narrator is also great, his voice is perfect for such documentaries. The people interviewed are mostly History teachers, and all of them obviously know what they are talking about.

However beware: these documentaries are mostly about wars and battles. I highly recommend this DVD set. :)

Although they may not hit on or go into extreme detail with every aspect of the empires, they do an superb job explaining the main points.

Getting his degree from Syracuse University in Italy, and having a great love for Roman history is where his new nickname ""Romo Cop"" comes from.  Anyway, there is a nice variety of empires featured, spanning all around the world.  Rome, Greece, Britain, and Egypt get a lot of attention from documentary film makers and networks, so it was nice to see the episodes on the Maya, China, Carthage, and Russia.

I like the computer animations that show block by block how the structures where actually made. I addition to the structures they also give you some basic backround history on the empires they are reviewing. But becouse of the length of the show(50min or so)you do not allways get a full history of it by anymeans. In many cases the show will show a leader and his accomplishments and then jump 2-3 hundred years into the future, Really though it does do a good job for a hour long show. I just hope they do some of the empires they missed such as India(or Raj)Olmecs,Hittites,sumer and ancient Isreal to name a few in another season.

Thank you.  I thought I saw the show about the Parthenon on the History Channel and thanks to your review I continued looking.  The show I was looking for aired on PBS ""Nova: Secrets of the Parthenon"" which shows what little we modern folks know about ancient Greek Architecture. The NOVA show gives some very cool Engineering and exceptional Architectural insights.  I guess I'll post this as well.  Thanks again.

So is ""Engineering an Empire"" only worth 1 star?  I rented Volume 1 and found it to be entertaining, but I don't want it for reference in my Library.  I tend to read the 5 star then I read the 1 and 2 star reviews too.

2692279,3,B000KJU1FU,"I found most of the episodes to be at least interesting, but those were also the subjects I knew the least about. I have a PhD in Italian Renaissance art and architecture, with a minor in Medieval art. I found many usually quite elementary mistakes in the Medieval and Renaissance episodes. First, the story about the ""cult of the carts"" is a post-Medieval fiction. The background and motivation for the origin of Gothic cathedrals is so garbled that it sounds like a sloppy edit. The term ""Gothic"" as applied to the art is also of post-Medieval origin.
 As for the Italian Renaissance, I must say that I knew Weller's Prof. Hatfield in graduate school, and I know he must be rather taken aback by some of the retold history here. First, Florence was important artistically long before the Medici arose (ever hear of Giotto?). The big mistake is on the dome of the Cathedral of Florence: Brunelleschi certainly knew the Pantheon, but he did not copy it in Florence. Neither he nor anyone else could figure out how the Pantheon's dome was built--no one knew about concrete and the building techniques used there--and so he re-used and adapted traditional Medieval dome architecture, but on a much larger scale. The explanation here of the design and the invention of the use of herringbone brickwork is well done.

Now and then I am pleasantly surprised by some of the shows, so I agreed for him to buy this one, right up my alley as I love ancient history, as well as archetecture and engineering.

Oh my. As another reviewer noted, this wasn't about history, architecture or engineering.  It was all about war and empire, blood and lust. I was eager to know how things were built, but got little except for 'biggest, greatest, strongest'. The host should have used less cliches and more actual detail on the wonderful engineering feats that were showcased.  I wasn't entirely sure about how accurate some of the history was, so I had to base the accuracy on how they handled two areas I knew quite a bit about, Constantinople and England.  Those were poorly done; for one thing it implied that the Turks were the only ones who razed that great city of Constantiople, ignoring the fact that the Crusaders did so a few hundred years prior.  With the one on England, one of my favorite topics, they depicted Henry VIII as starving for power and eating up territory as he plows in to another fried chicken, without any background or sense of context. Even my husband cringed. It made me realize that this whole series was for the lowest common denominator of viewers, the ones that want lust and blood and care little for real history or real engineering.  Pity, a series like this could have been really good. If you want real history of engineering, I'd suggest going elsewhere.",1275264000,8,1580,4.604982206405694

Everything the other reviewers said about the series and what it covers is correct - my complaint is that this is not about engineering, architecture or building.  It is about war and the quest for power.  I should have known, as this is what all History Channel shows are about.  As a builder, I had hoped to see in depth coverage of the actual building / construction.  Instead the focus is on empire, and the 'building' and consolidation of power in order to dominate.  The music, the tension, the conflict - if you watch tv at all, this is nothing new to you.  And if this is your thing, then by all means buy the set and enjoy.  If you liked 'Troy' or the new 'Robin Hood' then you will love this series.  But if you are, like I was, hoping to see all the good engineering behind the great civilizations and their incredible feats, this series will be a disappointment, as the coverage of such is very thin.",1275177600,6,971,4.410112359550562

Rome and Egypt each last 90 minutes on average and cover much ground as well as the actual engineering aspect of the respective empires. The remaining twelve episodes, at 45 minutes apiece are just as entertaining. My only issure with this set overall is that it is not in a Hi-Def format. I have a 50"" Plasma with a nice home theater sound system that would have made this edition look and sound great. Other than that this was a satisfying purchase to view with kids and grand children.

2692289,4,B000KJU1FU,"I very much enjoyed this series, and consider it one of the best productions by the History Channel (which today, sadly, has become burdened with worthless, non-history-related shows like Sandhogs, Ax Men, and Ice Road Truckers).  In fact, if I were to rate just about any of the episodes in this set individually, I would give it five stars.  The episodes are visually appealing (unlike, say, PBS documentaries), informative and somewhat in-depth without belaboring any one thing too much, and well paced.

The only reason I don't give this series five stars is that I consider its selection of civilizations a tad unfortunate.  Both the Mayans *and* Aztecs were covered (really, one *at most* would have sufficed, in my point of view).  And the Greeks were covered in three separate episodes (granted, these were three distinct civilizations through time, but again, redundant in the way that covering both the Mayans and Aztecs was).  I feel the price of this is that many important civilizations were left out entirely, such as that of Silla (ancient Korea), Japan, the Khmer civilization, the Indus valley civilizations, the list of important civilizations left out could go on.  Frankly, I struggle to understand how Mesoamerica got more representation in this series than did East Asia (or, for that matter, Southeast and South Asia).

So, overall, a great series, but a few episodes were redundant, and the price of this was a lack of coverage of some of history's most fascinating civilizations.",1242259200,3,1504,5.085365853658536

Weller makes architectural and engineering marvels accessible to a wide audience by keeping his coverage both erudite and entertaining.  The only critique that can be leveled against the series is its lack of coverage of select empires such as the Incas, the Mughals, and the African Empires with the exception of Egypt.

2692292,4,B000KJU1FU,"Yes, I can agree with some criticisms here that this series does not go deep enough into the pure engineering side of these cultures, but I think the docu makers were right to spend at least SOME time explaining the political/cultural ""why"" behind how this engineering happened at all in the various cultures. This puts everything happening into context. Also, being a commercial documentary, it is required to make SOME money or would never see the light of day. My hat off to the documentary makers who obviously worked quite hard to achieve what balance they could between all these factors. I sent this as a gift to my construction-career retired father, and he enjoyed both the engineering AND the historical aspects. We'd all like to see maybe more advanced writing, but when what's made is also accessible to junior-high age kids, it's more likely to get funded, made, and aired. That's what we all get when we choose a commercial culture as our primary mode of existence. Complaining about quality is what comes with capitalism.",1235433600,2,1036,4.892045454545454

A must for anyone interested in supplementing one's (or children's) education with classical training and appreciation for history, art and science.",1233619200,3,482,5.774647887323944
2692295,3,B000KJU1FU,"Ever since I saw the Rome production on the History Channel, I've been wanting to get the set.  I'm disappointed that there is no closed captioning, and also, I've come to see how quite a few facts have been omitted.  In the Rome episode, only supposedly the most influential emperors are discussed.  And I learned much more on my archeological excursions in Cancun than I did from the episode on the Maya.  But overall, I'd say this is worth having in one's collection if you like documentaries.  I'm going to try PBS Home Video's Empires Collection next, hoping it will be less dramatic and have CLOSED CAPTIONING.",1231632000,3,616,4.719626168224299

2692299,5,B000KJU1FU,"We purchased this set as a supplement to our World History homeschool curriculum, in an effort to help tie in the lessons with audio and visual.  We are now half-way through the set, and I can safely say they are a hit!

Not only have the videos made history relevent to a high school student that didn't care a whit about history before, it has sparked an interest in Engineering.  The combination of technolgy, culture and history has made a huge difference and resulted in my son's educational goals being set higher long term.

I would highly recommend this set to any Lego-maniac who doesn't find history interesting, and recommend it even more for those students who find reading dry and boring.  You will be surprised to find history is cooler than you thought, and you might even feel the need to grab a book and learn more!",1225756800,2,832,4.594594594594595

As some other of the reviewers have mentioned this does not cover the entire series but has everything you would want from this series for an academic purpose or for your own personal collection.

Peter Weller is a great host for this series and really uses great footage to bring out the reality of these empires which at one time existed. To bring out a basic understand of the civilizations of past can really help everyone, both for people in the study of history, and those not, understand our where our current civilization came from.

I would recommend this series to everyone, although for the fullest berth of this series one might consider picking up the collectors edition for the missing segments, with amazon actually currently pricing the collectors edition lower than this edition ($49.95 vs. $47.99).",1220227200,,913,4.772151898734177
2692301,5,B000KJU1FU,"This is one of the best series The History Channel did. I catch myself watching each episode over and over and learning something new each time.

I HIGHLY recommend it!",1208736000,2,168,4.6
2692302,5,B000KJU1FU,"The best thing about this series is that some of the episodes go beyond the typical fare for historical documentary subject matter. Rome, Egypt, and Europe have been done to death, but this series features episodes on Carthage, Persia, and the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) empires--which all recieve MUCH less attention than the deserve. The series also covers Native American empires--the Aztecs and Maya--, so there's a fair amount of diversity. There's also some diversity in time period, with episodes on the rennesiance-era Italian city-states, pre-industrial Russia, colonial Britain, and Napoleonic France in addition to the ancient civilizations. There is also an episode on China, and 2 on Greece during both the Helenistic and classical periods.

I appreciate the breadth of subject matter in terms of geography and time period. This is the first documentary I think I've ever seen to focus exclusively on Persia or Carthage and not on the roles they played in Western contexts (the Greco-Persian and Punic Wars respectively). Never-the-less, these events come up and get significant attention and discussion. It would have been nice to focus on ""fresh"" (less-well known) facts. But this is only a small complaint. Another small complaint is that the series did not take this idea further. I could have done without France, Britain, and 2 whole episodes on Greece, and instead seen something on India or the forgotten empires of Africa (Nubia, Ethiopia, Tim Buktu, etc). The Khmer, the Celts, the Islamic Caliphates, or any of the Mesopotamian empires that tend to never get documentary coverage (like the Assyrians or the Hittites, or even Sumeria or Babylon) would have been nice as well since one so rarely if ever is made aware of their existence while watching History Channel (plenty on Greece, Rome, and WW2 however!). But I do give them credit for being as broad as they were. It's nice to see that more history than just that of the West or China is finally getting some TV attention.

The only other complaint one could give is that the episodes are so general commercialized. They're still pretty informative and enjoyable for those interested in the subject, but it's legitimate to criticize the series for a lack of real depth and meat. They do manage to touch the big points and the bigger picture, however, so this flaw is by no means fatal--the series is just not as ""professional"" or ""scholarly"" as it could have been. For those perturbed by this, I would recommend the series Lost Treasures of the Ancient World, which packs much more information into half the time.

A final criticism might be the content in comparison to the title. The series really does not focus solely on Architectual subjects. I, for one, appreciated the parallel between ""building"" an empire and building great monuments that reflected the power and prestige of that empire. But some will undoubtedly feel there should have been more emphasis on the engineering aspects, such as actually including engineers for comment, which the series does not do. Others, however, might feel the general history was so weakly portrayed as to be of little value, and that more time should have been given to the empire's history itself. But the series really seeks to balance these two topics, and thus one can endlessly debate on what ratio of attention would have been best. One could also argue that the series should not have tried to cover both, because it just watered down both issues. I, however, feel that the balance was fair enough between the focuses, and I also feel that focusing exclusively on the engineering would be meaningless without a historical narrative to give these feats contexts, while to focus just on the historical narrative would have not have been true to the title and it would have been a completely different series (although perhaps an even more compelling one).

In the end, this is one of the better series produced by the History Channel in recent years and I think it's well worth checking out if you haven't seen it and well worth owning if you've seen and enjoyed a few of the episodes on TV.",1207267200,55,4120,4.940836940836941
2692303,3,B000KJU1FU,"I purchased this set because I am a fan of the series on the History Channel and wanted to own it on DVD. Sadly, I just realized that for only a few bucks more I could have gotten the Collector's Edition. THIS SET DOES NOT CONTAIN THE ENTIRE SERIES. It is missing the two original specials that spawned the series in the first place: Rome and Egypt. The Collector's Edition has 2 extra discs and featurs both of these award winning episodes--a total of 156 extra minutes of content (they each aired at 2 hours long with commercials compared to the 1 hour long season episodes). The Rome and Egypt episodes were also arguably the best of the series, in that they contained the most depth and the highest quality productions.

I highly recommend this series, but don't miss out by purchasing this set by accident. GO GET THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION for the most value and to experience ALL the content of the series.",1207267200,175,910,4.548780487804878
2692304,4,B000KJU1FU,"The History Channel's Engineering an Empire series, containing six DVDs, focuses on the engineering and architectural triumphs of great (and not so great) civilizations. Each of the programs attempts to feature a society's engineering accomplishments as a prism through which to view its history and culture. Because of the arbitrary selection of societies and engineering accomplishments and the limited length of each program, the series fails to achieve this grand goal, but it is still both entertaining and to a limited extent educational.

All too often, the engineering accomplishments of the civilizations covered are limited to aqueducts, the use of pilings to support buildings in marshes and over bodies of water, the discovery of the corbelled arch, and military inventions like the Greek triremes and the ubiquitous catapult in its various forms.

Although actors are used extensively, they look like you expect real people of the time would have looked, a major advantage that the History Channel has over PBS, where the actors are always English and good-looking. A History Channel Persian or Mayan looks like a Persian or Mayan.

One area in which the History Channel excels is that of Computer-Aided Design, which they use to ""reconstruct"" buildings that either lie in ruins or have disappeared. The results are remarkable.

On the negative side, while the experts who appear are clearly highly knowledgeable leaders in their field, that field is limited to history; relatively few professional engineers or architects appear.

The selection of Peter Weller (of RoboCop fame) as a host was initially off-putting to me (despite constant references to his links to Syracuse University, he apparently only received an M.A. from that institution, later becoming an adjunct lecturer there in film), but over time I came to appreciate his enthusiasm and willingness to laugh at himself.

Programs on the first four disks include:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Engineering-An-Empire-Vol-1-Greece-Age-of-Alexander-The-Aztecs-DVD/dp/B0013FIAB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Engineering An Empire, Vol. 1: Greece, Age of Alexander, & The Aztecs [DVD</a>] (141 min.)

I question the inclusion of the Aztec segment which generally talks about their use of pilings to build their city on a lake. In contrast the Mayan segment, which appears in Vol. 3, is fascinating -- truly an advanced civilization.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Engineering-An-Empire-Vol-2-Carthage-China-Russia-DVD/dp/B0013FPN8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Engineering An Empire, Vol. 2: Carthage, China & Russia [DVD</a>] (141 min.)

The segment on Da Vinci's world has nothing to do with Da Vinci, focusing instead on Brunelleschi's building of the Duomo and the rebuilding of Rome in the 1500s. A separate segment includes a Syracuse University architecture professor discussing Brunelleschi's Pazzi Chapel. I only wish it had lasted longer.

The final two disks, which appear to have been made before the first four, are the flagships of the series, each containing one long, high quality program:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Engineering-An-Empire-Vol-5-Rome-DVD/dp/B0013FK2E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Engineering An Empire, Vol. 5: Rome [DVD</a>] (94 min.)

More dramatic than the others, this program provides a nice overview of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. If you're only going to buy one disk, this is the one. It features excellent CAD reconstructions of many of the most famous Roman engineering accomplishments.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Engineering-An-Empire-Vol-6-Egypt-DVD/dp/B0013FPSR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Engineering An Empire, Vol. 6: Egypt [DVD</a>] (92 min.)

Also of very high quality. Again, the CAD reconstructions are excellent. The experts, especially a woman professor from the American University in Cairo, are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their subject. There's also an interesting add-on featuring Peter Weller talking about how he got into this line of work and why he enjoys it so much.

As indicated above, I question the inclusion of the Aztecs in this series, especially since there are other culturs that would have been more interesting (e.g., Babylon, India and the Incas.)

I did not experience the screen format problems that other viewers complain about, perhaps because my TV allows me to switch between five different formats, so I can use the best-fitting one.",1207180800,133,5168,6.595870206489676
