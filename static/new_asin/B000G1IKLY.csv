Can Soham's deep spirituality and Shwetambari's pure heart win over family and community? After all, what better place to try and enlighten those in darkness other than Banaras.

Critique: `Banaras' released in `06 is an exquisitely written, produced and directed mystical love story the likes of which could only come out of India. The cinematography alone makes this film worth watching. However the visuals are not all this film has to offer. The soundtrack is magnificent, the acting superior and the storyline both deeply spiritually and highly emotional at the same time. I absolutely love this film, it deserves to be seen and if you're like me you'll watch it more than once.",1197849600,2,1628,5.022222222222222
