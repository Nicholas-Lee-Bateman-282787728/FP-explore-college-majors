4096971,4,B0039KV7MI,"I've been a huge Johnny A. fan since his first CD release. I haven't watched the DVD of this performance yet, but I'm baffled by the CD version of the concert. The packaging clearly states that there are 14 tracks on the CD, the 14th track being ""Walk Away, Renee."" Yet the CD only has 13 tracks and the ""Jimi Jam"" (track 13) doesn't include ""Walk Away, Renee,"" unless it is so morphed that my experienced ears don't get it. This has nothing to do with Johnny A.'s chops or the concert performance (I give it a 9/10 for sonics and performance); I'm just not sure why there's a discrepancy between the number of tracks listed on the packaging and the number of tracks on the CD.

Johnny A.: You have a lot of fans in Cajun country of Louisiana. . .come down and work your magic on us LIVE!",1282262400,,788,4.253333333333333
4096972,5,B0039KV7MI,"Over the last ten years or so I've seen Mr. A play live in a few clubs in my area and have been blown away by his playing, not only what he plays, but how he does it. Near as I could tell, he played a Gibson straight through to a not overly-large Marshall amp and got this huge tone that would hit you like an arrow, not easy to do and shows his total dedication to his craft. This DVD was recorded in a Boston night club and was well produced - good camera work and editing and, most importantly, the sound is great. For those who know Johnny's music some new steps forward are taken here, all to the good. Not everthing is played ""clean"" and there is plenty of digital delay and other effects goodies present that adds a lot of juice to the mix, plus - at least for me - some new material. This guy is one of the greatest guitarists going and has (like Jeff Beck) more mojo in his right hand than most hotshots with the left. Great stuff, get yourself a copy.",1276905600,5,961,4.063157894736842
4096973,4,B0039KV7MI,This dvd is a great look at Johnny A at a live performance.  It makes you want more...especially after hearing the extra music on the cd.  Would have loved to see him play the cd-only songs too.,1274832000,,194,4.216216216216216
4096974,5,B0039KV7MI,"I once read a quote about Jeff Beck that I believe came from Eric Clapton, which I'll paraphrase: ""Beck is the world's most expressive guitarist. Unfortunately, he has nothing to express."" Now, I actually think Beck's recent work with Tal Wilkenfeld and others has kicked his pulse into gear at long last, so perhaps Clapton's observation doesn't apply as aptly as it once did. But the point, at one time, was fair.

As to the very great Johnny A, he's working the precise vein of electric guitar hyper-expressiveness that Beck, for all his technical brilliance, has somehow missed. In terms of style and influence, it's all there, from the crystal-clean jazz of Charlie Christian, Les Paul, Wes Montgomery and Chet Atkins to the beautiful cosmic muck of Hendrix, with stops along the way to sample Jimmy Page, David Gilmour, J.J. Cale, Lennon/McCartney, Knopfler, Zappa, and, yes, Clapton and Beck. The man can play anything, and add to that talent a fantastic ability as an arranger (if you've heard Beck's recent reworking of ""Day in the Life"" then you'll have an idea what Johnny A does with ""Eleanor Rigby"" or ""Wichita Lineman"" or any number of tunes by Chuck Berry) and a pair of accompanists on drums and bass that are brilliant in themselves, then you've got music that will simply astound you.

My one wish is that some established pop performer would put this guy on their opening bill and so give him the bigger audience he deserves. Believe it or not, I could see Johnny A opening for John Mayer or Pearl Jam or Tom Petty and absolutely priming the pump for those guys while broadening not only his exposure but also deepening his listeners' appreciation of music in general. Plus, he would slay them all.",1270252800,8,1717,4.777777777777778
4096975,5,B0039KV7MI,"This is a dvd/cd set, and I will review each separately.  The cd earns an easy 5 stars.  Johnny A. may have the most perfect, crystalline tone of any electric guitarist today.  Stylistically, he runs the gamut from jazz-based Wes Montgomery octaves to Danny Gatton twang to Hendrix, but the most prominent influence is Jeff Beck (despite the fact that he cites Hendrix as his primary influence in an interview snippet on the dvd).  In fact, this is the album that I always wished Jeff Beck would record.  While Wired and Blow By Blow are undeniable classics, I always found the keyboards a bit too much.  This album, though, is a simple trio.  The bassist and drummer provide a solid foundation, and mostly leave Johnny plenty of room for playing that epitomizes the title of Johnny's instructional DVD, ""taste, tone, space.""  If you have Johnny's two studio albums, you already have most of these tracks, but the playing on this one is sufficiently different to warrant attention, and the fidelity of the recording is excellent.  I honestly have no complaints about the cd.

The dvd is another matter.  The cd is around 70 minutes of outstanding music.  For some reason, the dvd is actually shorter than the cd!  The cd comes from the same concert, but for some reason, the dvd doesn't include all of the cd tracks.  There is only one track on the dvd that isn't on the cd.  It is a beautiful ballad at the end, but there is no reason not to put all of the tracks on the dvd.  It isn't as though the disc can't fit the full concert.  Furthermore, I was bothered by the editing.  Let's be honest-- if you are reading this, you are probably a guitarist who will only pay attention to the images on the screen if you want to stare at Johnny's hands and try to steal some of his licks.  Unfortunately, the camera doesn't stay focused on his hands.  We don't really need to see shots of his back, the rhythm section, the audience, or his cheesy, pencil-thin beard and hipster-doofus suit.  We want to stare at his hands and marvel at his instrumental elegance while mentally beating ourselves up for our inability to approach his perfection of tone.  Perhaps it is Johnny's commendable humility that led to these editing decisions, but frankly, I just wanted to stare at his hands.  Again, the music is outstanding, but the dvd could have been done better.

Further listening:  Derek Trucks' Live at the Georgia Theater.  This is another live album by a subtle and tasteful guitarist with perfect tone and a penchant for blending blues, jazz, rock, and funk, while also throwing in some world music elements without sounding like a new-age hack.",1269475200,18,2641,4.6501079913606915

8392091,5,B0039KV7MI,"I've been on this planet for 58 years, and yet I first learned of Johnny A
earlier this year (2014) surfing through YouTube videos of guitar related subjects,
as I am a guitar enthusiast....and I play a little myself.
Johnny A. is everything I wish I was able to be regarding his playing ability.
I have a new guitar hero.
This is a great video with high quality image and fantastic sound reproduction.
Sounds great through a regular 2.0 stereo system, but I bet it is unbelievable in
surround sound. AND....the bonus CD of all tracks played in the video is a
great treat for the car.",1414454400,,584,4.4672897196261685
8392092,5,B0039KV7MI,Being a guitar player for the past 37 I can get pretty darn picky when it comes to my selection of who or what I listen to. And when it comes to guitarist I set the bar high. I can tell you honestly that Johnny A. delivers in spades. I can't understand for the life of me why this guy isn't more well-known. I love his original material as well as his treatment of covers. This DVD/CD set is most definitely a gem in my collection.,1405382400,,431,4.023255813953488
8392093,4,B0039KV7MI,If you have ever seen him live you won't be disappointed by this vid. Just wish he would come out with more CD's to enjoy his talent.,1382486400,,133,3.962962962962963
8392094,5,B0039KV7MI,"If you are a fan of guitar then this is a MUST HAVE. JA is on fire and the boys in the band are feelin it. Some of the stops that they pull off are stunning and their dynamics remind you that going quite is really effective. The sound quality is, well, you just have to crank it on a nice system and drink in the groove.",1296691200,,320,3.791044776119403
8392095,4,B0039KV7MI,"If you like Johnny A. then buy this DVD/CD combo now!  The video is actually very watchable on my plasma (it's a shame it was not issued on blu-ray, but the video is still pretty good).  I only listened to the 2 channel uncompressed tracks since Dolby Digital throws away so much detail in order to fit 5.1 channels on a smaller signal than the 2 channel PCM.  On my $1,000 movie sound system this sounded like a 5 star recording.  On my $4,000 2 channel stereo it sounds like a 3.5 star recording (it's still a pretty good LIVE recording and I think it's worth it).  But it is actually very well produced- both video and audio.  Better than many other live concert DVDs that I have seen.

Whoever mixed the audio did a great job since all the instruments (only 3!- guitar, bass, and drums) are all at the correct levels.  Bass is tight and there's plenty of sweet midrange.  The video has nice angles and it doesn't switch too rapidly between various angles.  The concert is almost 60 minutes exactly.

The CD and DVD have a slightly different set of songs on them, which is great (the DVD has some songs that the CD does not and vice versa, but most are the same).  The 2 tracks on the end are tributes to Jimi Hendrix and I could have really done without them.  Johnny A's own material is superior by far.  The Hendrix song's are just too loud and noisy compared to Johnny A's own mellow and intricate  songs.  But I still recommend buying the DVD.",1295308800,,1451,4.338289962825279
