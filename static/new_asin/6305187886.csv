Ron Ormond took an unfinished movie started by Herbert Tevos, and tried to finish it with minimal effort - the story is presented  as a flashback via a minor character who couldn't possibly know the story,  continuity errors and overripe dialogue abound.

What a strange overbearing film filled with nonsensical plotting and bizarre characters/creatures.  Where to begin?  There are several starts to this story, depending on who's telling it.  The gist of it has a severely mad doctor (Jackie Coogan) in the desert making monsters and women of a sort who can't dance worth beans.  A plane crashes on their mesa.  A couple makes it out alive, the rest do not.  As all this plays out, a guitar keeps aimlessly strumming a tuneless tune while the crazy sarcastic narrator says the dopiest things, telling us about a place ""where the vultures wait for the other vultures to die.""  In the meantime, I impatiently waited and wanted the same for this ridiculous movie.

What can you say about a movie involving dwarfs, spider women, and really-real BIG spiders except that it was made by a ""race of puny bipeds"" with no aptitude for filmmaking on any level?

Doctor Aranya (Jackie Coogan) is experimenting with spiders, who are not ""hexapods"" as suggested by the opening narration. These spider-humans don't talk. The males are dwarfs, and the female ones have plucked eyebrows and pierced ears. They all shop at the same sheer dress store and appear to be deaf when dancing to music.

The same Mexican style horror music is played throughout the film, in nearly every scene, even if there is other music playing. The soundtrack in itself is comical.

This film is available as part of a 50 film sci-fi collection, I consider the best and cheapest way to go.

Unfortunately, the ""monsters getting the people"" scene, which I assume was supposed to be the most exciting, is far too drawn out & boring, which brings the entertainment to a screeching halt.

983235,2,6305187886,"There is one thing about this movie that stands out in my mind.  The music is awful; really awful.  The music is so awful that even if the movie content had been five stars, the music would have knocked it back to two stars.  The combination of repetitive, annoying guitar and a spinet or piano that appear to be out of tune, poorly played, or playing bad music, is terrible on the ears.  By the time the movie reaches its final seconds, you are thankful for the end of the music.

The whole movie is a flashback of a guy brought out of the desert who wants to go burn something.  This fellow's ravings are so intense that you think this movie has promise.  Now we go to a flashback.

We meet Dr. Leland Masterson (Harmon Stevens, appeared in a relatively small number of roles in his 15 year film career) who willingly goes to Zarpa Mesa to see Dr. Aranya's efforts.  Dr. Aranya is played by Jackie Coogan, a long-time veteran of television and movies who many may remember best as the original Uncle Fester on ""The Addam's Family.""  Dr. Masterson sees how horrible Dr. Aranya's experiments are, and he refuses to help, and then goes bonkers, turning into some sort of weird ultra-goodie for much of the rest of the movie.  Dr. Masterson shoots a woman who we know is one of the super spider women, and then climbs on board a plane to head somewhere.  The engine conks and the passengers land, by happy coincidence (can you see this one coming?), on Zarpa Mesa.

Evening falls and passengers are picked off one-by-one with weird puncture marks.  Finally, the few remaining passengers are taken to Dr. Aranya's laboratory, where a big fight ensues, there are flames and an explosion and we are returned to the present.  Wow.  Such excitement.  Such danger.  What an awesome movie.

This movie is so bad that it is bad.  There is minimal charm to the movie.  I like Jackie Coogan, but his role could have been played by anyone.  The music was awful.  The best part of the whole movie was the plane crash, which I thought was reasonably realistic.  With movies like these I try to either be at least a little frightened, or amused.  I was neither with this movie.  I wish there was some way to put this movie into perspective so that you have an idea of whether you should buy it.  Since I cannot, I will say that if you like a movie that is about tarantula women, with minimal appearances of any real tarantulas, and you can handle the awful music, then by golly, this could be just the movie for you.  However, I will note that this movie is worse than anything comparable by Ed Wood, so you can go from there.

Good luck!",1340150400,,2622,4.426778242677824
983236,4,6305187886,"When I first picked this movie I thought the title was MENSA of Lost Women. I thought it was about a group of female scientists and economists who get misdirected on the way to the Nobel Prize ceremony. Boy was I wrong!!!

  Ha-ha, ok now that I've gotten that out of my system let me review the movie for you.

  No matter what anyone says, especially the narrator of this film, this movie is primarily about titillation, 1950's style. All the talk about man playing God, or thrills and chills is secondary. The film features scantily clad women who look like they do things, bad things (You know what I mean), and plenty of them. Everything else is built around that. So at the same time you have June Allison and Doris Day warbling around about being good girls, you've got Tarantella here doing her infamous wanton Spider Dance. Does that tell us anything about the 50s? I dunno I'm too lazy to think about it.

 Anyhow there's this mad scientist (Union Local 757) in the Mexican desert who is injecting human pituitary juice into spiders and turning them into spider/human hybrids. At first you might wonder why it would even occur to anyone to do this, but think about it. The Prof. has an army of indestructible spider-babes who not only obey his every command but who are also probably pretty good at keeping the fly and mosquito population down around the Mesa. It really doesn't make sense NOT to create an army of exotic female spider/human hybrids.

  A varied group of travelers accidently runs across the mad scientist, and for dramatic purposes conflict ensues. The doc wants to kill some of them and use the others for experimentation. Now these travelers are some of the most knuckle-headed and unlikable characters ever to trudge across the screen in a z grade movie, yet they still manage to escape from the clutches of a brilliant scientist and his enclave of deadly spider woman, who were bred with the predatory instincts of killer spiders.

  The highlight of this paean to incompetence is the infamous Spider Dance, performed by the Head Spider Woman, Tarantella, in a little saloon referred to by one of the characters as ""a dump!"" The actress who plays Tarantella, Tandra Quinn, is a sexy woman and does her best to elicit that angry, lustful yet detached attitude that you know a spider-woman hybrid would have.  I'm sure she was trying to deliver an expression that the director was sure a female spider would show if you could see her tiny little face, except with fewer eyes and fangs. Instead of a look of wanton ferocity, Tarantella looked more ticked off, like you just stole her parking space at the mall while she was coming down off a latte bender. The Spider Dance was supposed to be dangerously alluring, which I suppose it would be if you managed to avoid throwing up from the motion sickness it causes. Still, she's an attractive woman and one of the best things about this movie.

  The real star of the show here though, is the massive ineptitude displayed by everyone involved. You'd almost think this film was produced by a Congressional Committee it's done so poorly. And that's what makes it so watchable. It's just so utterly terrible that you can't take your eyes away. You'll actually marvel at the awkward execution of it all. This movie isn't amateurish. It's the work of professional bunglers.

  The bottom line is that this is a classic b movie of the ""so bad it's good"" stable.",1309910400,,3432,4.677204658901831
983237,1,6305187886,"I have been on a binge of c-grade scifi flicks of the 50s/60s, and I barely got thru this one.  Indeed, it was so ridiculously bad that I don't think I am going to return to this genre for a number of years.  Jackie Coogan was what attracted me to this and I was hoping to find an old gem with some ideas, interesting monsters, and the inadvertent laughs one expects from such films.  But there was nothing appealing in the film, from the truly awful acting to the dull, cheap prop of a monster.  The story line, unsurprisingly, was utterly unoriginal.

Well this gives Manos a run for its money as far as being atrocious

1- The Spider isn't on screen enough
2- The *acting* was just terrible
3- the music was irritating ..extremely irritating
This lacked any decent characters and was a complete dud. Jackie Coogan (yes he was Uncle Fester in the Adams Family) probably disowned this movie a long time ago. He is conducting experiments with females with the soul of a Spider injected into them

983378,4,6305187886,"Right before I was lulled into unconciousness by the flamenco guitar/piano soundtrack, I knew when I came to I should jot down a couple of lines about this opus. Ed Wood fans sing his praises on high but who carries the torch for Ron Ormond? Indeed, this film is a virtual who's who for Wood fans. Delores Fuller pops up,  Lyle Talbot narrates (one of the greatest non-Wood rants ever penned), and Wood even recycled that comfortably numb soundtrack for ""Jailbait"". But the real wonder here is Harmon Stevens as Leland Masterson. From the get-go, when Stevens is on the screen you can't take your eyes off him. In particular a sequence at a sleazy Mexican dive when Masterson/Stevens is sitting at a table across from Doreen Culbertson/Paula. This is one of longest zombie grins in film history this side of the father in ""Eraserhead"" during the dinner sequence. Yes, Uncle Fester(Jackie Coogan) is on hand as the mastermind behind it all but he turns in an Academy award performance in comparison to the others. The inanity does slow a bit about half way through but bad movie lovers can't go wrong with this.

983379,4,6305187886,"Wow, what a delightful stinker this movie is. Sexually attractive spider women, scientists who either went nuts or just started out that way, painfully annoying Hoyt Curtin musical score which was later recycled into another Howco masterpiece ""Jailbait"", narration by the ubiquitous Lyle Talbot, Jackie Coogan at the absolute bottom of his career, Dolores Fuller and Mona McKinnon at the beginning of theirs, politically incorrect stereotypes, this flick has it all. Nowhere near as bad as ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" or ""Robot Monster"" and a lot better than the hackneyed, first person, ""vacuous twentysomething with a camcorder"" crap dribbling out of Hollywood these days.

The real ""star"" of this flick is Tandra Quinn who played the seductive spider woman Tarantella. Everyone else including Jackie Coogan, who was clearly just scrapping to keep a roof over his head at this point, was supporting cast for her. Whatever happened to her anyway? What legs she had, that ""stare"" of hers, and that titillating ""dance"" of hers in the border town dive of a bar. What was she doing hanging out in that bar in the first place?? Being snared in HER spider web and being taken advantage of is one of my favorite fantasies.

I gave the movie four stars because it is certainly better than ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" and I gave it three. It really does not deserve five though, in spite of the fact that Ed Wood simply MUST have at least been watching this production from the sidelines.

P.S. This review is for the Alpha Video version, I have not seen the Image Entertainment version. But how can it be any different??

983383,1,6305187886,"MESA OF LOST WOMEN is truly a bad movie--unfortunately it is not bad enough in the ""good"" category to be even remotely entertaining. There is plenty or blame to go around. The acting is atrocious.  There is no chance that the audience will suspend however momentarily the ability to withold the difference between the false reality of any film and the non-reality of this one.  Jackie Coogan of ""The Adams Family"" fame is Dr. Aranya (Spanish for ""spider"") who develops a serum that can change spiders into women--or is it the reverse; the film does not make that clear.  None of the other actors is a household name--except perhaps for Mona Mackinnon, who stars in the immortal PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, an opus that puts this one to shame. Then there is the budget. Does the term ""shoestring"" come to mind? Other films have had to operate under much the same handicap, but the best of that lot manage to redeem themselves by redirecting the audience's attention  away from the truly god-awful special effects by some minimally competent acting and directing. No such luck here.  There are a few shots of a rubbery spider that descends on a hapless victim even as one can see the not hidden strings manipulating that descent. There is the abysmal directing of Ron Ormand and Herbert Tevos, who have the actors hold hands like children crossing the street as they wander through the lost mesa jungle.  And they do this more than once for no apparent reason.  Finally, there is the manner in which Ormand and Tevos use a confusing narrative point of view of flashbacks within flashbacks. As they misdirect the viewer by having one flashback which suggests one coherent narrator, they inexplicably switch to an internal flashback with an unrelated other narrator.  And this switching happens yet a third time before they abandon the concept altogether by dropping all previous narrators and filming a sequential plot with predictably disastrous results.  The only redeeming point is the weirdly sexy cantina dance of Tarantella (get it, Tarantula?) played by Tandra Quinn, who undulates her arms in a manner mildly suggestive of a spider's limbs.  There is no point going over the plot in any reasonably coherent way.

As you might expect, the plot is a bit difficult to follow in places, but essentially deals with Jackie Coogan as the evil Dr. Arana (also spelled Aranya in some versions), which, cleverly, is Spanish for ""spider."" Given that piece of foreshadowing it's pretty much inevitable that he will create huge, chemically mutated leaping spiders, dancing spider women, as well as a bunch of dwarf men in accordance with his understanding of the arachnid world. There are subplots about a plane crash, murder, and romance, but honestly, the whole thing is so tepid that I just ended up screaming ""End!"" at the television for the last twenty minutes of the film or so. The dancing scenes are particularly un-erotic, despite the reaction shots of the men in the audience, while the portrayal of ""Pepe,"" the standard-issue cartoonishly superstitious Mexican national definitely dates this turkey.

I was feeling generous and gave this film two stars on the basis of the hilarious spider puppets and the endless droning flamenco guitar soundtrack, which is ever present and wildly inappropriate. Don't get me wrong, the soundtrack is awful, it just gets a bonus star for the comic juxtaposition against otherwise odorous background action. The ""double narration"" technique is also quite annoying, as there are several places where there is not one, but two narrators explaining what's going on. On balance, though, it's good that someone is explaining it, or I might have to watch it again to try and figure it out for myself.

So by injecting human female growth enzymes into spiders, we have giant tarantulas.
No doubt  you've heard of the seductive and ultra sexy dance performed in the bar by Tandra Quinn . It is not over-exaggerated. For it's time it's probably the hottest bit of celluloid from that era. Clearly it is the high point of the movie.

The girl lost her hair band, bracelet, or whatever the heck it was, and the `Man Friday' is sent to look for it. Of course he is working for the mad scientist and gets killed by him when he descends into the lab.
Now there is more walking around the set (Meanwhile we have a romance building up between the girl and the pilot). The girl's fiance get's killed by a spider's stomach, and finally they make it down to the lab. OK let's see, the super strong female (who is immune to bullets by the way) is held easily by an ordinary girl. They escape and wrap up the film conveniently with an explosion (what else)?  The film ends with a super girl on the side of the cliff, watching and waiting.
The worst part of the movie by far is the music (yes, it's worse than the not-so-special effects). It's this piano/guitar thing that just plays over and over and over and over.
Watch with caution, but don't expect much. When you say you'd rather watch Cat Women on the Moon instead of this, that's really saying something.",1052611200,4,2318,4.348729792147806
983459,5,6305187886,"Mesa Of Lost Women is one of my favorite hunks of cheese! Jackie Coogan (yep, uncle Fester) is a mad scientist, working with petuitary gland transplants. He's successfully transplanted tarantula glands into human women (it doesn't work on men, only turns them into evil dwarves), turning them into mute amazons with extremely tacky wigs. Another scientist visits Dr. Fester and sees the horrible experiments. He refuses to help, so the head spider-woman ""Taran-Tella"" (Tandra Quinn) injects him with a serum that seems to make him bonkers. The good doctor ends up in the nuthouse, only to escape out a window. Anyway, he seeks revenge on Taran-Tella and shoots her (after she is allowed to dance in a saloon, causing hearts to race). The vengeful, nutty doctor then forces a pilot (Allan Nixon) to take him back to the mesa. Lots of spider-women and dwarves roam around aimlessly. A giant, stuffed tarantula flops onto a hapless victim or two, and fun is had by all. The ending is no surprise, but I'll not spoil it here. The soundtrack is hideous!! A flamenco guitar twangs along, accompanied by piano work best described as being played by a hammer-handed baboon on acid! Highly recommended...",1052524800,13,1195,4.9502487562189055

983461,5,6305187886,"First of all, I feel I should state that I am a huge fan of B-movies, cult movies, bad cheesy old horror/sci-fi movies, anything weird etc, and if you are not into this kind of thing, this movie probably isn't even worth one star to you.  That being said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can relate to my obsession.
  Mesa of Lost Women is often compared to the movies of director Ed Wood, and is considered by some to be the ""worst movie of all time,"" but I don't think that analysis of the film is entirely fair or accurate.  Don't get me wrong, I think Ed Wood was a genius when it comes to schlock, and comparing any B-movie to one of Wood's films should be considered the highest possible compliment, but this movie differs from Wood's movies and just about any other grade Z film I can think of, and is certainly not the worst movie ever. (It sure as hell beats watching Gone With the Wind!)
  First of all, as soon as this film begins, it is plain to see that this is movie is not meant to be taken as a serious straightforward attempt at horror/sci-fi.  The bizarreness of this movie is deliberate, effective and very unusual for its time.  If this film was made by David Lynch or John Waters, people would be calling it the eccentric work of a genius, but since it was made in 1952 when people just didn't make those kind of movies, most people mistake it for an inept attempt at making a ""normal"" monster movie.  In fact Mesa of Lost Women resembles the work of Lynch at least as much if not more than it does the movies of Ed Wood, and although Mesa of Lost Women has been accused of ""making no sense,"" It actually makes a hell of a lot more sense than Mulholland Drive, and is just as understandable and enjoyable as Eraserhead which, in my opinion, is Lynch's best movie.
  The soundtrack of the movie also deserves to be mentioned (way cool and also very unusual for its time.)  Jackie Coogan is great as a deadpan mad scientist and Harmon Stevens is excellent as the crazy Dr. Masterson.  Watch for his odd frozen facial expressions.  This is a must-have for b-movie fans or anyone who appreciates weirdness on film.",1047772800,6,2143,4.365239294710327
983462,2,6305187886,"When I happened upon this movie, a couple of things caught my eye: it features Jackie Coogan (who would go on to play Uncle Fester in The Addams Family) and there are some huge tarantulas involved.  How bad could it be?  The answer is very bad indeed.  Here's a basic rundown of the plot.  Dr. Arana (Coogan) has a secret lab on Zarpa Mesa  in the Mexican desert, where he is performing growth experiments on humans and animals.  What he has produced are some great big tarantulas and a cadre of mute, seemingly fierce women and several male dwarfs.  He invites the reputable Dr. Masterson to aid him in his work, but Masterson refuses, is driven insane, and winds up in an institution.  He escapes just in time to kidnap a man and his fianc&eacute;, a servant name Wu, and a handler from the mental institution.  He commandeers the rich man's plane and forces the pilot to take them up despite a failing left engine.  They crash on this big mesa out in the desert, where they eventually get an unwelcome introduction to Dr. Arana and his minions.
I learned more about this movie from reading a two-sentence synopsis than I did actually watching the thing.  All of the women are apparently mute, and Arana somehow communicates with them telepathically.  The whole notion of spider-women seems to fade away as the movie progresses, being supplanted by the huge tarantula concept.  Apparently, though, Arana plans to use his creations to take over the world in some kind of typical mad scientist manner.  I couldn't find a single likable character in this movie.  We don't even see enough of Arana to understand what he is actually up to, and the other characters are all hopelessly bland.
The only thing interesting about this movie consists of the rumors swirling around its origin.  Some people have tried to claim Mesa of Lost Women as a secret Ed Wood movie; these rumors have been put to rest by now, but there is definitely an Ed Wood feel to the story.  According to the son of Herbert Tevos, his father made but did not finish a film for Howco Productions called Tarantula, and some time later Howco Production asked Ron Ormond to complete the movie, which he did by adding Dr. Arana, the spider-women, and a few other touches, thus producing Mesa of Lost Women.  What is undoubtedly true is that the film is presented in a peculiar fashion.  A rather flippant narrator opens and closes the story for us, sometimes actually speaking to one of the characters, and in between we learn the tale told by two exhausted humans picked up in the middle of the desert.  The guy telling the story first flashes back to Dr. Masterson's first encounter with Arana, which is something he could not possibly know anything about; only then does he choose to flash back to the events he himself was a witness to.  It is amazing to see how a simple story can be made incredibly complex at the hands of bad moviemakers.",1045180800,4,2908,4.618677042801556
983463,5,6305187886,"Ormond once produced and directed the Lash LaRue fims and then struck off on his own making some awful films like
this one and Monster and the Stripper.
This one belongs right next to Phil Tucker's Robot Monster and Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster as one of the worst.  It's even got a really annoying psuedo flamenco guitar soundtrack that Ormond let Wood borrow for some his films.
What makes this film go truly off the charts into classic awfuldom is the fact the story is told via a flashback WITHIN another flashback from a character that was not involved in the story at all so couldn't possibly have a flashback involving the story in the first place.
Utterly cheesy effects, horrible dialogue, a couple of performance so awful you won't believe it.  The project began as a different film called Tarantula and Ormond came in, took some of the shot footage, added new stuff and created this one of kind
film for bad movie afficianados.

983464,3,6305187886,"I would have to include Mesa of Lost Women in that unique subgenre of ""is it spellbindingly awful or just awful?"" (members of which include The Creeping Terror, Beast of Yucca Flats, They Saved Hitler's Brain, Teenage Devil Dolls, Battlefield Earth, etc.). Bad movie fans may find this a scream, or merely dull depending on their taste and mind-set at the time of viewing (and how many Carl Dreyer films they've made it through). No rants please, I love Carl Dreyer movies. It is fairly slow-moving, even for a poverty-stricken 50s thriller, and that guitar-and-piano score has the potential to put the most stable person in the rubber room. That said, the plot, dialogue, characterizations, etc. are so loony that there is much to marvel at for those tough enough to stick it out: Jackie (Uncle Fester) Coogan as a demented scientist, Spider-Babe Tandra Quinn's bizarre dance stylings, mutant midgets, florid narration, etc. And this is mandatory viewing for fans of that giant spider prop (you know the one).
The DVD itself is not terrific, but serviceable. The brightness, contrast, and tonal values are quite adequate, although the sharpness is a bit soft, and the print suffers from relatively low-level but fairly constant speckling, dirt spots, and sporadic vertical and horizontal scratches. Some stretches of the film are pretty clean, some aren't, although overall it is still an improvement over the VHS copy I taped off PBS [!!] several years back. Interestingly, the TV print shows vertical scratching at the same points in the film and in the same locations in the frame as the DVD; perhaps these flaws derive from the master elements. In other details, the prints were not identical. There appear to be no missing shots/scenes other than the 15-second ""prologue"" tacked on to the TV print before the opening titles (was this part of the original theatrical release?). The DVD actually runs just slightly longer than my tape. Extras include the Mesa trailer (also a little dirty), chapter stops, and five more trailers advertising other Image discs. Not as impressive as other Image releases (e.g., Missile to the Moon), but given the history of this movie, it's possible that no better print of the film was available. Once again, Z-movie completists will probably be pleased with the disc, if not overly excited; anyone not into this stuff already, run for your life!",999820800,7,2383,5.02020202020202

Trivia: The narrator is Lyle Talbot, who was in some serious movies in the 30's, 40's and 50's but later appeared in Edward D. Wood Jr.'s (Ed Wood) ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".

With great actors as Jackie Coogan (you can tell he must be the bad guy with a huge mole on his face), Allan Nixon, Tandra Quinn and Delores Fuller, You know it can not go wrong. Yeah, sure.

The dialog gets a little boring and some of the screen play (by Herbert Tevos) is a little disoriented. I suspect that much was cut out for brevity; so we must make great leaps and assume we just missed something.

There is a great dance scene by Tarantella (Tandra Quinn) that would subdue Captain Kirk had he been there.

Do not worry though we have wonderful background music by Hoyt Curtin that consists of an off key flamingo guitar and a spinet that won't spin; I think they are trying to sound Spanish; you get to hear it during the beginning credits; You get to hear it during the narration (by Lyle Talbot); you get to hear it every time a suspenseful scene appears; You get to hear it every time one does not; you still hear it when the DVD is safely packed away.",1503705600,,1365,4.198473282442748

7884753,1,6305187886,"This review is for 'Mesa of Lost Women' by Image Entertainment and for the The Film Detective release.

Before you go further, let it be known that without a doubt, this is one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made. More on that to come. But for starters:

IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT DVD: This version is superior to The Film Detective. The picture quality, while nothing is special is definitely clearer. There are also extra's in the forms of a bunch of trailers.

THE FILM DETECTIVE DVD: I'm not sure what they mean by 'restored.' This picture is inferior to the Wade Williams Image release. There are no extra's.

At the time of this review in May, 2016, you could get the Image release 'new' for 5 dollars while The Film Detective version would cost you double that. Until a blu-ray is released, Image is the way to go.

PLOT/SUMMARY:  The movie opens with two people, a  man and a woman wandering aimlessly through the desert in Mexico. An oil company employee who is working sees them and rescues them with the help of his superstitious helper, Pepe. He brings them to a hospital where they are suffering from exhaustion and severe dehydration. The man, Grant, is a pilot and the girl, Doreen, is/was the fiancee of Jan van Croft, an industrialist. Grant regains consciousness and hears Dan the foreman and Dr. Tucker discussing their possibilities for survival. He starts ranting about sending oil trucks to destroy 'Them'. He then tells his story which takes place as a flashback and consists of remainder of the story except for the brief end to the framing story. The flashback actually starts before Grant's part of the story. I think the first part of the flashback is supposed to be told through the eyes of Pepe.
Dr. Masterson travels to the mesa where Dr. Aranya has his laboratory. He has been told of his theories (not theories! according to Dr. Aranya) and wants to learn about them. We learn that Dr. Aranya has to perfrom his experiments in secret because what he is doing is considered unethical. What we find out is that he is combing DNA, hormones, etc. or whatever of spiders and humans. Since, in the insect world, females are usually superior in size and strength to men, he is having better success with women. The men are all turning out to be midgets and dwarves whereas the women are strong, beautiful and nearly indestructible. The most prominent of the spider women is Tarantella. When Dr. Masterson sees the giant spider that Dr. Aranya has under his control he immediately says ""no thank you"" to being his assistant. Of course, Dr. Aranya cannot allow Dr. Masterson to leave and tell the world of what he is doing. At this point he injects Dr. Masterson with something and either releases him or he escapes, I'm not sure which. In any event he ends up in an asylum and then he escapes the asylum. Dr. Masterson ends up at a bar where he meets up with Mr. Jan Van Croft and his fiancee, Doreen and manservant Wu. They are stuck there due to the fact that the plane they hired has developed engine trouble. The pilot is none other than our hero, Grant. George, an orderly at the asylum shows up to bring Dr. Masterson back but is held off by Masterson's gun. Tarantella, the spider-woman happens to be at the bar and does a spider (tarantula?) dance, at least that's what I think it was. Dr. Masterson, who is now loony, recognizes and shoots Tarantella. Dr. Masterson then orders the whole group to board the plane and take off. They leave Tarantella for dead, however she has survived due to her new superhuman(superinsect?) abilities.
From here, I'm assuming, Grant's story takes over ;from Pepe's vision. The plane takes off and has to come in for an emergency landing due to the fact that it is not fully repaired. Of course they land right on top of the mesa that Dr. Aranya has his laboratory. Our group, for whatever reason, never disarm Dr. Masterson despite the fact that they have many chances and can easily overpower him. They decide to make camp by the airplane and then as usual with these sorts of movies, start to make all sorts of idiotic decisions which leads to the demise of some and also treachery by one of the individuals and ultimately a confrontation with the spider-beast and Dr. Aranya.
Nobody believes Grant's story, they probably think he is delirious and the movie has an ending typical of movies of the era.

PRODUCTION: At least the movie had one notable actor, Jackie Coogan of Addams Family fame or for fame from the silent era. The acting is not good. It is mostly over the top and just plain bad. Tandra Quinn, who played Tarantella, would be in one more sc-fi movie of note, 'The Neanderthal Man,' which was not as bad as you would think. She played the mute housekeeper.
The music is just flat out annoying. I guess it was supposed to add Mexican flavor.
It was rumored that Ed Wood was involved with this movie but that myth has since been debunked.
This movie was so bad when it was finished that it was unreleasable. The director had to go back and add new shots and do some edits to make it more understandable.

THOUGHTS: This is without question one of the worst science fiction movies ever made. I used to have it ranked second worst but I have since seen a few more awful movies. As of now I think it is probably somewhere between fourth and sixth worst. But that is not really saying much since the other contenders are distinctly awful. Into the mix we can throw in 'Beast of Yucca Flats', 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', 'King Dinosaur', 'The Cape Canveral Monsters' and 'Robot Monster'. This is off the top of my head, I'm sure I'm missing a few. 'Manos:The Hands of Fate' is worse than all of these (except possibly 'Beast of Yucca Flats') but is not sci-fi.

The characters are completely unlikable with the possible exception of Dr. Masterson, with whom you kind of root for in a 'Hannibal Lecter' sort of way. It's surprising to see in movie from the 50's, a woman who clearly is up to no good go unpunished. Doreen, who is engaged, right from the get go starts hitting on Grant the pilot. Though she admits she is with Jan for security, it's surprising to see her so blatantly attempt to 'cheat' on him.

The narrator is annoying and unnecessary.
Speaking of annoying, this movie had one of the worst sound tracks I've ever heard. That guitar couldn't possibly be more annoying. It kind of makes you want to grab it and smash it.
