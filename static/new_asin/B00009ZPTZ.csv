1898942,5,B00009ZPTZ,"""Out for a Kill"" is one of the most monumental movies ever made. Steven Seagal is a hero, one of the best action stars ever. As a college professor, Seagal is on a quest to avenge the death of his wife. When she died, he had the most saddened-looking face I've ever seen (typical Seagal face). The villains are over-the-top and are even worse actors than Seagal. He went to a man's underground lair and said, ""Sei Lo, I thought I might find you here, nee how!"" Then he said, ""You touched the most sacred thing in my life, you killed my wife. Now you've forced me to dig two graves."" Buy this movie right now! It's pure lordage.",1058745600,3,627,4.277310924369748
1898943,2,B00009ZPTZ,"Oh boy...what can I say I had an urge for bone crushing Seagal, and what do I get...A huge over weight Seagal that can barely get his words out of his mouth; seriously, no wonder they dub Segal's lines now, you can barely hear what the heck he is saying, usually he is mumbling or speaking very low. Not only that the trench coat is so annoying. I mean they say if you wear Black you will look thinner, sure its true, on someone who is thin...Not someone who is nearly 300 pounds...come' on Stevie you should know better. And to mention that Seagal plays an Architect in this movie, oh give me a break; I can accept A cop ,C.I.A. Operative, Mercenary or even an oil rig take out fire expert, but an Architect ,please it's like saying Jim Carrey could play  Indiana Jones.

The movie starts right away with Seagal working in a dig with a fellow lady architect. After his find he is given an award for his work and excellence (yeah right) in another dig Seagal notices something strange; and he is right because someone is smuggling drugs into his artifacts. Anyhow to make things short Seagal's partner gets killed and he is blamed for it, he is sent to jail somewhere in i don't know where...funniest thing is Seagal trying to be gangsta. He meets a jail mate that so happens to become friends with him in the short periods of stay in the cell. The way that scene ends is so laughable, it's pointless and the character is only seen once and is never mentioned again.

Another interesting notion is the action sequences, unlike future DTV releases of Seagal's films, here he does approximately 89% of his fights, and he barely has stunt doubles, so that's good. But...ugh..Seagal's fat, he looks horrible fighting...fighting, what am I saying, I mean patty cake; that's what he does on screen, slap fight around his victims, and somehow his opponents fly miles away from a simple punch..WTF?  Oh and not to mention one of the concluding fight scenes; he water fists a guy, it's hard to explain, but it's true. Seagal runs up to the bad guy (of course the guy who runs is a double) and as they're about to hit each other, the fists meet (aw how sweet) and voila water, miracle appears..

So do we have a miracle here due to Seagal's water fist? Nope more like an atrocity. trust me there is more worse things that happen here, a fight in a Barber shop in Chinatown with a man who.. uhm.. fights like a monkey and another fight in a temple of some sort with monks who have these swords that look like they're made of aluminum foil...its all B.S. the storyline is plain unoriginal, the fights have no creativity whatsoever, Seagal' can barely get a sentence through, his face looks more bloated then ever, and in the end Seagal saves the day...I guess. please don't buy this, not even rent, unless your a Die Hard Seagal Fan like me; and to think the torture I am gona have next week watching the other 3 Seagal DTV movie I bought. Definitely not worth it.

1898944,1,B00009ZPTZ,"We'd have to say this effort from Seagal feels like it us below the belt. It's quite apparent that many years of chini buffet and boatloads of wild turkey chased with busch beer have not been good to the old boy Steve. Half the time when he's on the screen we can't tell if it's him or an equally obese stunt double until he begins to speak. The things that come out of his mouth are so muffled by his cheek fat that they're nearly inaudible and most likely not part of the english language, or any language for that matter. Once you do find a sentence or two you can understand you'll wish you didn't. In Out for a Kill this is just about all there is to find. The extreme lack of action is so overshadowed by the bizzare dialogue that you really aren't sure whether to turn it off or not. It's almost hypnotic but in a very very bad way.

Out for a Kill begins with Archeology Professor Robert Burns (Seagal), yeah he seriously plays an archaeologist, as he is heading up a dig in Eastern Chini. We suspect he was searching for prehistoric egg rolls but come to find he is there to discover someancient Chinese artifacts. In tubby's findings he sees that the Chinese mafia is smuggling drugs inside these artifacts which naturally he makes his business pissing off a bunch of chinese maniacs. They wind up killing Seagals assistant and planting the drugs on him while crossing the border sending him to prison where his only call will be spent dialing a 976 number or the overeaters anonymous hotline. While in jail nothing cool happens. There is not one prison fight, no escape attempt, or anything you expect from a typical action packed Seagal session. All you get to watch is a pathetic overweight archaeologist/washed up actor as he ponders better times where he didn't have to walk sideways to fit through a doorway. After a couple days the DEA decides Seagal will be a great value in bringing down the Chinese mafia and let him loose. Now that he is out the Chinise mob has a price out on his head and also has threatened the life of his wife. This sends Seagal into panic mode where he must unlease the inner beast. The only trouble is the inner beast put on 207 extra pounds which make it's fury a bit sluggish. The one scene that stands out is when Seagal busts into a barber shop where he unloads of a few Chinese guys until they send out their secret weapon. It's some little guy that moves really odd yet very similar to Tang from Journey to the West. This guy soars through the air, climbs up and down walls, and does all these obsurd things sending the film to new hieghts of martial arts B. As much a the human panda tries to catch him he just can't. Tang is way to quick and Seagal is just too damn fat. After minutes that feel like hours go by Seagal grabs a sheet and wraps the little guy up then snaps his neck. Following this we get a few more hilarious fight scenes as he climbs the ladder to get to the mob leader. Despite his chubby nature Seagal still single handedly takes down the Chinise Mafia making him yet again a great American hero.

After this one we just kind of looked at each other wondering what is happening to Seagal. The guy has always been laughable, even in his early really decent efforts, but now it's just getting sad. This one appears to be the start of the downfall where he starting pumping out film after film just to earn some extra dough to pay off his huge escort service bill. Now despite the extreme panning of this one in no way, shape, or form will we stay away from Seagals films. We still have about 130 to go and plan on watching and reviewing them all no matter how bad they get. We're professionals and will not back down from any B no matter what the cost.",1218758400,7,3721,4.329512893982808
1898945,3,B00009ZPTZ,"""Out for a Kill"" is one of Steven Seagal's most lambasted films, and rightfully so: produced during the depths of his contract with Sony and directed by the same fellow who brought us the organized boredom of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>, this is one slapped-together lunchbox of a movie that shows just how much Seagal lost by stepping down from theatrical features. However, it does gain a little through repeated viewings, and over time I've come to appreciate the chances the film took before no doubt being mauled to death in post-production. In a way, ""Out for a Kill"" doesn't deserve three stars at all, but I've come to regard it amicably enough that I'll give it a passing rating. Know, though, that it's best watched by genuine fans of Steven who know how to take the bad with the good; everyone else will despise it.

The story: a thief-turned-archaeologist (Seagal) is set up by a coalition of Chinese crime families to take the fall for their drug trafficking, but when they push him too far, he fights back and travels the world to gain vengeance.

I hate this movie's editing, I really do. There is genuine disharmony between the main shots and those filmed by the second unit: cutaway angles are poorly interspersed among longer ones in far too many scenes, robbing them of mood and generally making the film look as though it were edited by a high school student. This goes double for random post-production additions, like the text scrawls introducing the villains and the on-again-off-again narration by a character played by Michelle Goh (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Lockdown/dp/B00074CBF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Lockdown</a>). Why are these things in the movie if they're not consistent with the main style? Then again, as the film plays on and more strange aesthetic decisions are revealed (e.g. the blatant overuse of digital backgrounds), I get the feeling that there is no set style here, and that it's more of a weird visual experiment. I'm probably wrong, but one thing's for sure: no other Steven Seagal movie has a look quite like this, for better or worse.

Considering many of the other films of the same era, it's surprising how much action there is in this one. Pleasingly, most of it's martial arts-related: I counted seven separate substantial fights, not including a weird-out scene wherein Seagal flings a sword out of a window and decapitates a man. And these aren't just any fights, but ones with a strong Hong Kong flair to them, having been choreographed by Lau Chi-Ho (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Chinese-Ghost-Story/dp/6305020876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Chinese Ghost Story</a>) and featuring such curious match-ups as Seagal taking on twin assassin-priests with swords and dueling a monkey-fu practitioner who literally scales the walls. But before you get your hopes up, know that these have also been greatly marred by editing: the coolness of all the flips, Hong Kong-style camera angles, and choreography is undermined by the editing, which either speeds up or slow-motions the action to nearly unbearable lengths. Nevertheless, it's genuinely cool to see Seagal in fights as fantastic as these, and I'm glad that he was able to get better results using a similar action style in the following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-of-the-Beast/dp/B00441GYQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly of the Beast</a>.

The story and script are eventually pretty easy to follow, and actually feature some cool aspects like the tattoo codes. Also, writer Danny Lerner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Delta-Force/dp/B000063VAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation Delta Force</a>&nbsp;series) deserves a big slap on the back for having the audacity and courage to have Steven Seagal play a friggin' university professor of all things. Altogether, this synthesizes into a very strange, occasionally enjoyable vehicle that, again, is not for casual fans but makes a fun study for guys like me who can enjoy Steven's outings for their strangeness.",1215734400,,4299,5.862619808306709
1898946,2,B00009ZPTZ,"While I was tempted to give Out for a Kill 1 star, I gave it 2 stars for a couple of reasons. At least Seagal's character was something other than an ex-CIA/special forces guy...OK he was Chi Kung master, but at least he was something else! Another reason for the upgrade to 2 stars is the plot. Yes. There was nothing special with this plot, but at least it is one that can be followed. Unlike most of Seagal's most recent storyline, this one makes some sense. Again, it's certainly no Academy Award winner, but it's much better than some of Seagal's most recent efforts. Perhaps the biggest reason for giving this two stars is that 1 Star should be saved for his truly atrocious films such as The Patriot or Submerged. The fight scenes were decent but I'd love to see Seagal get back to more of the Aikido that he used in earlier films.

As was the case with the last Seagal film that I watched, the sound quality was awful. Rather than raising and lowering the volume to hear the dialogue, I simply turned on the subtitles. I'm more a fan (or simply a glutton for punishment) than my wife. She stopped watching after 15 minutes!",1157587200,,1131,4.411483253588517

1898948,1,B00009ZPTZ,"If Steven Seagal really was under pressure from the Mob to make this and all the other later disastrous films in his career, I suppose he can't be blamed for putting on the pounds and taking on a 'who cares?' attitude. His earlier films have the stamp of well-choregraphed high action, realistic and slickly done. The plots might be pretty predictable, but if you were looking for a good testosterone charged action thriller, Steven Seagal could deliver. There was frequently an ecological message being delivered about how man is ruining the planet, so a spiritual message was often contained in a Seagal film, which was good if subtly given, but a little preachy if not. The main issue here is that Seagal's first movies were some of the best action productions with a spiritual message tagged on somewhere, whereas his latest ones have all been crap. His heart just doesn't seem to be in it any more and it shows. His Buddhist master may have advised him not to make any more violent movies, but it should have been advice not to make any completely crap ones. I'd personally like to see him do one more really good one, even if his role (given that he's older) was adapted accordingly, maybe something along the line of Charles Bronson in The Mechanic as the hitman mentor of Jan Michael Vincent.",1135123200,,1300,4.681222707423581
1898949,1,B00009ZPTZ,"Back in the 1990's, Steven Segal and Jean-Claude Van Damme were the stars going head to head at the cinema for these types of movies. They, unlike Arnold, Bruce Willis, and Stallone, were both heavy into martial arts. Both had similiar acting styles (look mean -hit people). Both went into the straight to video route after a few under performing theatrical releases. But if Seagal keeps putting out crap like this, Van Damme might be looked upon in 100 years from now as the better of the two. He did afterall, go into sci-fi, tried more creative approaches in his movie plots and acted as if he really wanted to be an actor...he played a ex-con, a cop, a soldier,a father, even twins with more depth. Sure, he fell like Seagal in the end, but not as hard.

  Seagal, on the other hand, stayed the course with very few exceptions (except The Patriot) playing all characters the same. And somewhere in the late 1990s, tried to add a environmental message into his films, sometimes awkwardly.

  I heard, but don't know for sure, that he dated or married a Chinese lady, and this changed his movie style to the Asian themed, Asian style direction, and the choppy editing that have plagued his latest films.

  You have read the reviews of Out to A Kill so I won't go into it. But I do have suggestions for Steven if he ever reads Amazon.com

  This movie would have worked better if he was a retired professor whose son was framed. He could have married a Chinese woman. He goes to China to snoop around about his son being in jail, and kills a bad guy who is with those that are smuggling the goods. The rest of the bad guys, as well as the Chinese police, and the American police are after him until the gets to the bottom of it and proves his son's innocence. Explain somewhere in the film he was martial arts teacher at the college he taught and one time was a champion so he kicks butt realistically..

  In fact, in this movie no characters (such as his wife)that are really explained....they just come and go. The acting is terrible all around.

  Action is nice and expected, but the story actually matters and time alloted for character's personalities to come together has to happen for it to be well recieved by most people (remember Under Seige?)Then it might get a theatrical release instead of the usual straight to video hell.

  LOSE WEIGHT. Be like other stars. Take pride in yourself. When a movie is in pre-production, other stars hit the gym, go jogging, etc. George Clooney once said he got in shape by cutting back on eating and working out hard twice a day for 8 weeks or more before shooting started. Stallone trained for months before the Rocky and Rambo flicks.

  Take acting lessons. Show more emotional range and still be a tuff guy. Maybe like Bruce Willis in his later roles?

  Get rid of the long leather jackets. It makes you look like My Cousin Vinney...totally out of place.

  Do something with the hair. Anything. Tie it back like you used to if nothing else.

  Play parts that fit your age, like Clint Eastwood does.

  Practice your martial arts and get your edge back so we don't have to endure stunt doubles, slow motion, camera tricks. Be like Jackie Chan and be real.

  Your fans love you so please respect them by no longer turning out doggie-do like this.",1131753600,2,3302,4.513513513513513
1898950,1,B00009ZPTZ,"Steven Seagal drops yet another classic on the film world with 'Out For A Kill'.

Seagal stars as an overweight but super-sexy professor named Robert Burns.  He's an expert in ancient Chinese relics and is in China doing some excavation and cataloging of newly found antiques.  Unbeknownst to him, the people who hired him are using him to move drugs out of the country.  Boy, did these wacky Chinese drugdealers pick the wrong professor to screw with.  The Lord is arrested and sent to a Chinese prison, leaving his mailorder Russian bride all alone.  He's in prison for an undisclosed amount of time, but due to the editing it seems like he was in lockdown for about twenty minutes.  He is released through some stringpulling by the American government to use him as a pawn to lure out the drugdealers.  Little do these dealers know, but Lord Steven was once the most feared theif in China.  So, the dealers decide that Steven needs to be eliminated so they blow up his house.  Only the Lord isn't inside but his Russian wife is.  He gets pissed, swears revenge, and hilarity ensues.

'Out For A Kill' is pretty much pure crap.  The plot is ridiculous and very vague.  The fight scenes are pretty sad(especially when Seagal fights a small Chinaman who happens to know some sort of monkey kung fu).  There are numerous useless characters:  the black dude Seagal befriends in prison who the filmmakers lead you to believe will have something to do with the plot later on but actually is never heard from again.  And also there are the two DEA agents who do nothing more than show up to find the bodies of Seagal's victims and say lame crap like ""He moves like a ghost"".  I died at that one.  He doesn't even come close to moving like a ghost.  All he did was lumber his tubby ass out the door.  Hilarity.

Anyways, 'Out For A Kill' sports a lame script, pathetic acting, sad fight scenes, absolutely putrid dialogue, and a vast sheen of vagueness.  This one is for hardcore Seagal fans only and even they won't like it.  Watching this movie is like getting fingerbanged by your grandfather:  you may want to enjoy it, but its just uncomfortable.",1130630400,3,2145,4.581578947368421
1898951,1,B00009ZPTZ,"This film is just awful. It is by far the cheapest of the post Steven Seagal Hollywood films.

The film looks like it was trying for some humor in a couple of places, but it just doesn't work because the film is so bad. Some of the actors appear to try their best but the acting is very uneven. The budget looks like it was half a shoestring becuase it is very very cheap looking. Green screen was used for some of the takes even when two of the characters are supposed to be outside looking at the sky. Did they not even have the outside available? The sets are trash, one guy spins around, obviously, on a wire and crawls around on the walls during one of the fight scenes. Slow motion is used extensively. This movie exploits a poor script, is filmed badly, looks ultra cheap and has really bad effects.

1898953,1,B00009ZPTZ,"Either Steven Seagal has absolutely NO self-respect or the Mob were just too damn scary for him when it came to signing the contract for this total pile of crap.

They couldn't even be bothered to come up with an good title. Instead they took Hard to Kill and Out for Justice and combined them (Hard to Justice?). But don't even think for one minute that this film is up to the standards of Seagal's golden years. You'll NEVER see anything worse than this. Well, Son of the Mask maybe.

Seagal plays an archaeologist (well, it's a change from Cop or ex-CIA) who's precious Chinese artifacts and pots are siezed by the Tong (the non-threatening Chinese Syndicate baddies) and stuffed with brown sugar (or cocaine, I don't know). Big Steve stumbles upon this dastardly deed and takes off for the Uzbekistan border. A hundred baddies come out of nowhere and start firing at him.

Big Steve is promptly framed and sent to jail, where he meets a character introduced as his new sidekick but is quickly forgotten about and never seen or heard from again. What the hell was the point in this? It turns out that Steve used to be in the CIA (oh for the love of crumb cake) and was their best ghost thief (huh?) and the DEA release him for some reason and he goes home to his quiet American suburb, where the Tong blow up his wife and house.

Steve goes on a killing spree. But what helps is that every Chinaman who's neck he breaks has a one-word tattoo on his arm that when added up makes an ancient Chinese proverb that provides the right order of tiles to push in case of fire in the Tong bosses office. What? Don't look at me! I didn't write this!

The bad guys don't do anything apart from sit at a long table in a poorly-lit and cold-looking room and smoke cigars while looking evil. The boss isn't even Chinese but an Ian Hislop-lookalike with bushy eyebrows. Every 10 minutes the film will jump to them (subtitles list their hobbies and interests for some strange reason!) and the boss goes 'We have to stop him, he knows too much'.

The fight scenes are horrible. What is the deal with the kung-fu monkey barber? Seriously! What is the deal with that? The computer-generated effects are the worst ever (second to Son of the Mask, nothing will beat that in terms of terribleness). I've seen more convincing stuff on a ZX Spectrum.

Seagal puts NO effort into this film. He looks incredibly bored through-out and looks like he'd rather be praying to Budda. However, you can almost see Frankie Fingers from The Mob loitering off-camera, pointing a gun at his head. I know I wouldn't show enthusiasm if that were the case.

Out for a Kill is directed by Mike Oblonglowiscz, the same amatuer responsible for the equally as horrible The Foreigner. The man has NO idea how to make films and should never be allowed near a camera again. He desperately tries to mime Michael Bay (a dubious choice of inspiration) with his pointless stutter-cuts and incoherent editing which only makes the film look worse, turning it into an avalanche on top of another avalanche. It's quite possible one of the ugliest-looking film you'll ever see. Considering some of the high-profile and veteran production members it's phenomenal they made a film so indescribably bad.

Eternal, everlasting shame on all those involved with making this trash. Utter crap of the lowest order.

The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, showing off the ugly photography and poorly planned camera angles in all their rubbishy glory. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack also turns the films unbelievebly bad sound design into pure torture for the ears. The cover also features 2 exploding helicopters.

Not sure how to explain it other than saying that this movie is one of my least fav Segal movie next to the Foreigner.

It seems however both the director and Seagal must have watched The Foreigner and tried to produce something better for their next movie by incorporating more martial arts confrontations. Seagal is back to eliminating the bad guys with good old bone crunching effect. There is a sword fight thrown in at the beginning of the movie but it betrays just how slow Seagal has become these last few years in comparison to the great sword fight at the end of Marked For Death many years ago. There is several fight scenes spaced out through the movie but none are executed as they should be. Some are slowed down while others are speeded up and one weird confrontation has a man running along the walls of a barber shop trying to avoid Seagal. The first 20 minutes are not bad and I thought that I was going to be in for a better time than The Foreigner but the movie took a nose dive after the 20 minute mark. Seagal just doesn't even try to put the effort into saying his lines. Most of his scenes at the beginning are all done in voice over with Seagal just sitting there doing that strange lip motion that turned up in Ticker, perhaps a new addition to his acting method for his later roles!! Some scenes in the movie do betray how low the budget was with dodgy CGI flying sequences and background blue screen. Some of the actors even wear the same clothes all the way through the movie. Seagal just looks bored and over weight and probably wants to be off making another echo friendly save the whales' movie rather than this. Seagal's argument for leaving Warner Brothers was that they made him do movies he didn't want to do so by that logic now that he has left Warner Brothers, the type of movie he really wants to make to entertain his once large fan base are badly made, low budget, incoherent crap like Ticker, The Foreigner and this.

Could someone tell me what is the band and song name? I think this is the only interesting thing in this movie lol",1092441600,4,612,4.126050420168068
1898959,1,B00009ZPTZ,"Shot back-to-back with terrible ""The Foreigner"" Steven Seagal comes back with another terrible movie.  It is beyond my capacity to describe how bad it is, but I can say that I slept while watching it in theater (yes, they released it theatrically in Japan, you know, what a silly decision).
The plot is non-existent, but it should be alright if there are good amount of exciting actions.  Sorry, but there are none, and though the film is supposed to follow the one-man's vendetta against Chinese mafia after his beloved ones are killed by them because of the drug lord, there is no emotional power that would make us relate to the hero Steven plays.  His ""Hard to Kill"" is not a classic, but it has a power enough to make it worth watching.
Anyway, Steven Seagal is dressed as an eminent professor of archeology (!) who receives an award from Yale University.  Seriously.  Well, there still would be no reason for us to doubt the authenticity of that character if only his name was something other than ""Robert Burns.""  Come on!  Is this a bad joke using the name of famous poet?  The naming is as laughable as that of ""Postman"" where Kevin Costner called a fictional American president ""Richard Sterkey"" (aka Ringo Starr).
And actions are terrible.  Just terrible.  Because of the poor, choppy editing, you don't know what is happening on the screen.  The murky lighting also damages the actions, and if they think they are shooting a noir film, they are utterly mistaken -- see how Steven Seagal's character speaks the line like ""You killed my wife"" as if ordering a cheeseburger, and you will know why.
Director Michael Oblowitz once made ""This World, Then Fireworks,"" a so-so noir starring Bliiy Zane, but ""Out for a Kill,"" together with ""The Foreigner,"" totally erased what impressed me before.  And as to Steven Seagal ... what can I say?  It was 11 years ago when he hit the No. 1 at the US box-office with ""Under Siege,"" and that was really a long time ago.",1083369600,13,1966,4.6473988439306355
1898960,1,B00009ZPTZ,"I have been less than complimentary in my previous reviews of Mr Seagals recent offerings, but please don't think I have anything personal against him. The reverse is in fact true in that I have often been admonished for being a stalwart fan over the years. That having been said, I simply cannot recommend this cringeworthy, and dire outpouring any more than his other recent turkeys, which have been pretty awful to say the least. Perhaps his material and script choices are letting him down too much? Earlier films were exceptional in comparison, and in a competetive genre, one was always, it seemed, able to rely on Mr Seagal to deliver the goods, so to speak. In the unikely event that a comparison was ever drawn between Steven Seagal and say Clint Eastwood for example, we would see that the latter has moved graciously into older and more believable roles that expand on the character, whilst still retaining enough action and eye candy for fans and mainstream viewers. Where Seagal has stuck with the same formula that worked in the past, and has resulted in him coming across as a comical 007 character, desperately in need of retirement. A brief synopsis here finds Seagal as an archeologist battling drug lords who are using his artifacts to traffic their product without his knowledge. He does of course take umbrage to this, and after his family, dog, pet hamster and any other thing dear to him have been attacked or killed (as usual) he justifiably goes on the rampage. That's really all you need to know, and wouldn't be too bad in itself if the film were then braced with mountains of action. But sadly, even the once revered fight choreography scenes now seem also to be in short supply, and the end result is textbook formula nonsense. I didn't really care about the characters, or the plot which is a real shame. I only hope the eagerly anticipated Under Siege 3 will bring us back to the earlier Seagal, and a much greater performance.",1082592000,18,1958,4.711370262390671
1898961,1,B00009ZPTZ,"I'm a card-carrying Steven Seagal fan (and have taken much abuse for it) but even I know that this movie is a dog. While no masterpiece his other flick from this period ""The Foreigner"" is much better. One can only hope that he slims down and ups the action for Under Seige 3 otherwise even long time hard-core fans such as myself won't even risk a rental on his movies in future.",1079827200,5,379,4.277777777777778
1898962,1,B00009ZPTZ,"Seagal plays an archeologist who gets into hot water when drug traffickers decide that the artifacts he digs up are as good a place as any to hide their smuggled drugs.  But Seagal doesn't like this, nor does he like the fact that they kill his wife and send the DEA and police after him.  Will he prove his innocence?  Will he avenge the death of his wife?  Will his precious archaeological finds survive bullets, car chases, and martial arts mayhem?  Who cares?
This direct to DVD mess is another one of Seagal's quickly pasted together junkers that is almost painful to watch.  There are some well directed fight scenes, but they seem almost as if they were filmed for their own sakes and not for the film's (fake Shaolin monks and a classical monkey kung fu master pop up out of nowhere to fight Seagal just for the sake of adding some action scenes).  The rest of the film is amateurishly directed with Seagal filmed from behind and in long shots (probably being doubled most of the time) with his voice added in later (using his standard whisper speak).  That dialogue seems to come as an afterthought in an attempt to try to make some sense of what is happening onscreen since the visuals alone simply don't cut the mustard.  An example of the director's lack of visual style is witnessed during scenes set at a long table filled with mafia bosses who Steven gradually offs one by one.  The numbers of seated people dwindle each time the camera goes back to that table.  The leader still speaks with the same determination to his men even when there's just one left sitting there.  Obviously all of these scenes were filmed at the same time and the director didn't know how ridiculously repeated this visual theme would turn out.
Once again in a Seagal picture the main characters aren't developed to any extent as people with personalities to care for or despise.  We are simply expected to root for Seagal because he's on the cover of the box and bad stuff happens to him in the movie so he must be the good guy.  The fact that the characters he plays can always beat everyone up is now supposed to be just a given since he's Steven Seagal.
The film EXIT WOUNDS proved hopeful for Seagal fans bringing back the Steven we've come to love (an angry, big and tall, regular Joe who uses real martial arts techniques that are appropriate to his character, in that case he plays a tough cop who may have learned these skills for his job), but he has followed that film's success with rubbish.  Fans deserve more than just a couple fights in the films they watch.  They need at least a semi-interesting story with dialogue and visuals that help move the story along sensibly, and they need semi-interesting characters to like and hate so that the action scenes and the fights have some meaning.
OUT FOR A KILL offers a couple of okay fights for Seagal, but they stick out like sore thumbs in an otherwise poorly sewn mitten of a movie.  Recommended for diehard fans only.",1076716800,5,2973,4.537453183520599

1898964,1,B00009ZPTZ,"After buying 'The Foreigner' I had made up my mind to never buy another Steven Segal movie - then I weakened and bought 'Out For a Kill'.  I should have followed my own advice.  The long coat doesn't hide the garguantuan, old, made-up, lethargic Steven Seagal.  The plot was so phoney and there must be something wrong with Seagal's voice because he sounded like a cartoon character.  After two movies of long coats, the real-life, out-of-shape Steven Seagal shines forth.  The obvious dyed hair (to hide the gray) didn't work.  He needs to cut off the locks and create a new character - the martial arts moon has eclipsed.  Maybe a hard-boiled city detective who shows the young s***s some tricks?",1073260800,2,698,4.7190082644628095
1898965,1,B00009ZPTZ,"After having the misfortune to sit through THE FOREIGNER I consolled myself with the preconception that although Steven Seagal may never make a truly great movie; & he may never be able to act he at least can't stoop any lower than that. Can he?
Then I rented OUT FOR A KILL. I could end my review here; but I feel it is my duty to waste a few minutes summarising this dreck & then cautioning people against renting it (this set me back NZ$4!)
The ""plot"" centers around a Chinese gang war led by drug dealer Tommy Li (ha ha), who is assembling dealers from Paris, NY, London, Shanghai et al in a bid to gain 100% control of the World's drug market, run exclusively by the Chinese (How racist!) Who can stop these evil [insert preferred term/expletive here]? Steven Seagal that's who!
Seagal (looking very old & pudgy) plays Robert Burns (no Scots accents cuz Steve can't act. Hoots mon!) an archeologist, professor & academic. A mere  ten minutes into the movie & credibilty has already flown out the window.
Steve runs afoul of these drug kingpins when they murder his pretty Chinese partner while he's on a dig in Kazakstan- this is shot in a supremely daft digital ""travelling bullet"" sequence. But Steve is framed for the murder and arrested.  So Steve escapes & seeks bloody revenge. If only real life were that simple!
OUT FOR A KILL is just one of many unremarkable straight to DVD actioners clogging video store shelves. Even the martial arts sequences are  snore inducing. In addition to this the main Chinese villains are all brick-outhouse types clad in well-cut business suits who sit arouhd a big mahogany table in a dark smoky boardroom planning their next move. That's always a bad sign. And in addition to THIS there are loads of unconvincing martial arts fights where you can see the fly-by wire harnessed to the actor if you look carefully enough.
This is just marginally more watchable than THE FOREIGNER, but OUT FOR A KILL makes UNDER SIEGE look like a true blue Oscar contender. Even by Steve's low standards this is pretty lousy.
The movie is Directed by Michael Oblowitz; who made the last half-decent Seagal vehicle HALF PAST DEAD, Co-produced by Seagal & his ego & Produced by Avi Lerner & BOAZ DAVIDSON, which is always a bad sign. View at your own risk. Though there IS  a car chase an hour or so into the movie which is halfway decent; but why suffer through this slop when you can watch BULLITT or THE FRENCH CONNECTION?",1067558400,2,2450,4.5995423340961095

Let's just say that there is diffinatly no good acting in this movie (other then the DEA guy who acts like it is a porn they're filming), nor is there good action, humor, diolog, or suspence.

1898968,1,B00009ZPTZ,"I think this is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever (willingly) seen...and that's quite a few!  What can I say that is good about this movie?  Pretty much nothing.  Let's address some of its fatal flaws: (1) Poor dialogue.  Yes, this is an action movie, but without more than 3 words per minute, it's hard to understand what's going on. Also, without a doubt some of the cheesiest lines for the bad guys I have ever heard.  One says ""You're f@#%ed white boy"" 5 seconds before Seagal throws him through a window. (2) Poor special effects.  Or, more accurately, a failure to mask the special effects that are in this movie.  For example, the ""sky effect"" is very lame... at Seagal's house in the U.S. and when he's ""interrogating"" the pilot by pretending to crash the plane.  Also, when he fights the guy in the barber shop who likes to float through midair like Casper the Ghost.  Ridiculous.  I think the producers wanted a ""Matrix""-like effect with the fight sequences, but they want you to believe the fights are real (unlike the Matrix, where suspension of disbelief is part of the storyline, played to great effect), which clearly does not work.  The CGI used is not at all necessary to make this movie, which makes it clear that this is a very low-budget flick. (3) Very flat characters.  No, I didn't expect to know the innermost psyches of each character, but some vital ones are left almost completely undeveloped.  Examples: (a) Seagal's cellmate, King, which seems to be a person Seagal will meet again (given the dialogue), never appears after he gets out.  Very confusing.  (b) Seagal's wife, very easy on the eyes, but obviously not an actress.  She mumbles her words, and overdoes it with the facial expressions of dismay every time hubby decides to kick someone's butt in a crowded restaurant.  We see her so little that when his house blows up with her in it, who cares?  (c) The head Tong guy.  So forgettable I don't even remember his name.  All we see of him is his scowling at a table with ever decreasing henchmen.  He repeats himself constantly, which is very annoying. (4) A totally disconnected plot.  I mean seriously, we go from southern China, to America, to Eastern Europe, Bulgaria, etc.  He can't stay in one location for more than 10 minutes.  I understand this is the ""Tong network"", but why would each bad guy wait exactly in a predictable spot when they know Seagal is coming to kill them?  And the biggest flop?  An archaeologist who used to be a thief who knows advanced martial arts, might be a government agent, etc.  Who is this guy?  A spin on this theme worked in ""On Deadly Ground"" because his merc background was apparent from the beginning.  However, such a notorious person going into hiding by becoming a world reknowned professor is laughable.
This DVD landed in the trash can after one viewing.  Just making it through to the end was a supreme effort of will, believe me.  In the final analysis, this movie fails so horribly because I think it takes on way too much of a plot with such a limited budget.  With the proper (major) studio backing, and a few competent writers, this could have been a much better film.  As is, it has a film student project feel to it.  Seagal should be ashamed to even be associated with this movie.
I cried at the end not because it was dramatic, but because I wasted $20 on this piece of trash and the thought of someone else being victimized as well.  Lesson learned: if it is straight to video a la Seagal, better get a second opinion first.  Or, in the words of a previous reviewer, ""rent it cheap!""  Better yet, pass this stinker up entirely.",1066521600,5,3633,4.568111455108359

The thing is, you have to go into Steve's movies knowing what you see is what you get. Over night he is not going to turn into Humphrey Bogart or Richard Burton, any more than JC Van Damme. Once you accept this, their movies are easier to watch.

Soundtrack should be lowered 10%; voices up 10%.  I turned on subtitles because the movie is good and worth it.  It gained momentum 10 minutes in.  There's no stopping a determined person.

Sadly, I'm still waiting after seeing this film. Now this is quite an improvement over Ticker and The Patriot, which were, IMO, the bottom of the barrell for Steve, but I still can't recommend it. The fact of the matter is, he's just too fat to pull off his fight scenes and it's painfully evident here. No amount of quick editing, long shots or dark lighting can hide the fact that he's not fighting and it seemed pretty obvious that most of the opponents he killed here would clean his clock in a real battle. I do have to give the director style points and kudos for creating a fairly well-produced film for what I would imagine is a miniscule budget. The plot as usual was run-of-the mill, but had some weird mystical bits added to it(what was with that monkey wall fighter anyway??) and the acting was bad (especially the asian police detective), but that can be expected and sometimes forgiven with these movies.

1898975,1,B00009ZPTZ,"Whoa.
Steven Seagal is the guilty pleasure movie star.  He's a very bad actor, he has a pony tail, he makes movies where he bullies people and smacks them around.  Yet has his own built-in appeal--a completely shameless, mysterious tough guy to the end persona.
However, his latest slew of films indicate that he is done for.  A bunch of straight to DVD titles prove how far the mighty have fallen.
Out for a Kill comes very close to knocking Ticker off the list as the worst Seagal film.  Only that film's more famous cast made it that much worse.
I don't know how to describe this film except BAD--as in worse than most bad TV movies.  I know Seagal got a few million for this, easy, so I don't feel bad for the guy.  But the quality of the film is so low that it makes early Seagal works like Out for Justice seem like masterpieces.
There are so many composite shots in this film that it tells a nasty story of making low budget films these days.  People have access to cgi technology that makes the films look even worse and cheaper than the low budget flicks of the past.  Entire sequences are so laughably bad, so cheap, that you may feel unsettled by the whole experience.
The film doesn't even warrant me talking about the story or plot, except to say that Seagal plays a professor(!)  Of course, he's a professor who is capable of killing a lot of people violently and of spouting more spiritual mumbo-jumbo that's sure to get laughs.
I don't know what happened to this man, but he tries to portray himself as some kind of messianic figure, clad in a massive leather coat to hide the rolls of fat as he rids the world of vermin.  This is embarassing all around.

1898976,1,B00009ZPTZ,"With one of the worst titles for any kind of movie in recent memory, this new Steven Seagal actioner limps its way onto DVD. Produced by those kind folks at Nu Image (who have continually amazed us with such direct-to-video nightmares as DERAILED, SPIDERS and OPERATION DELTA FORCE), this is the kind of movie that makes you want to stop watching films altogether.
The story has The Tall Guy playing renowned archeologist Robert Burns, who has unearthed precious artifacts in Eastern China. However, the chinese mafia are using these artifacts to smuggle drugs overseas and within seconds, Seagal is framed, has his assistant murdered and is sent to prison. MInutes (which seem like hours) unfold as Seagal is released by the US/Chinese police, using him as bait to lure the mafia into the open. As these things usually do, everything goes wrong for the police and Seagal's wife is killed in a fiery explosion, leaving him distraught, angry and (ahem) out for a kill.
With a plot that resembles a convoluted DEATH WISH sequel crossed with a dozen Hong Kong actioners, this movie fails to involve the viewer at any point. Seagal himself seems bored out of his mind, as he casually walks around seedy areas of town tracking down the men who killed his wife, getting up to the odd rough and tumble with every kung fu villain around who manages to look at him the wrong way. A fight sequence in a gent's hairdressers manages to be not only boring, but also mildly embarrassing as Seagal's opponent is obviously on wires and his movements defy any gravity at all, and the scene comes across looking awkward and pointless.
Director Michael Oblowitz (who collaborated on Seagal's last flick, a dreadful number called THE FOREIGNER) seems to have no flair for action whatsoever, insisting on long takes, dull characterisation, lazy pacing and making no effort to get the best out of his performers at all. His MTV-lite camera work is dull, and everyone in his movies seems to be acting as though they were in a Calvin Klein commercial. What with this, the aforementioned THE FOREIGNER and the awful vampire 'non' action flick THE BREED, Oblowitz needs to take an 'Action Movie 101' course. Quickly.
Adding another dud to his CV, Seagal seems to be intent on destroying any chance of a movie career that he reclaimed with the fun actioner EXIT WOUNDS, by appearing in films like this. What with this, the headache inducing HALF PAST DEAD and TICKER (where I thought there was nowhere lower for him to go), its sad to see a former action giant running around in non-events such as these. I can only hope he goes back to Warner Bros, and makes some decent action output again. Even his last effort there, the tired FIRE DOWN BELOW looks like a DIE HARD movie compared to his latter efforts.
Columbia-Tristars' disc is clean of any extras, except a trailer. The picture and audio quality are sharp, and the only picture problems arise from the film being shot in fake neon-lights and awful bare-bones locations.
All-in-all, not a winner. If you have to put yourself through it, make sure you have a copy of EXIT WOUNDS or OUT FOR JUSTICE ready to jam into your DVD player once this one is over.

1898977,1,B00009ZPTZ,"I made the mistake of buying this movie without checking reviews (I saw it in a dvd store).  OH. MY. GOD.  I have been a Segal fan from way back, but his movies are getting steadily worse.  I was actually sort of impressed that someone funded The Stranger, lacking, as it did, any semblance of plot or interest.  The direction was awful, the effects, the cinematography, the fight sequences, soundtrack, everything.  This movie was worse.
Moments of slow motion--for no discernable reason, stilted dialogue, HORRIBLE acting, poor action sequences, etc.  Heck, half the action scenes (why else would you be watching a Segal movie) are from an angle that lead me to believe it's not even Segal, but a stunt double.  If you make the mistake of watching the movie, you'll really appreciate the plane sequence.  Segal, wresting control from the pilot suddenly scares the pilot into talking by making several dives near the ground.  This is supposed to scare a pilot?  Not to mention the 'movement' outside the plane windows are patently fake.
I think it says it all when the movie is forced to use text during slow motion scenes to introduce people (who die offscreen).  Segal pieces together the 'mystery' of the people he's looking for by the series of helpful clues--yes, the bad guys have left a trail leading him in the right direction via tatooing their henchmen on the arms.  What the hell?!?  Let's lead police or bad guys to the head honcho with TATOOS?!?
For the love of god, if you want an action film, DON'T watch this one.  Go watch Under Siege 1 or 2.  Or Hard to Kill.  Avoid this wretched excuse for a movie.  While you're at it, avoid the Stranger, too.

I started watching his films as a kid (I saw his first film, ABOVE THE LAW at the theatre along with all that followed) and I figure since I've seen every one I can't stop now. Besides, I thought HALF PAST DEAD was a decent B action movie and I even got somewhat of a kick out of THE FOREIGNER even though I know it was a terrible film. I think I just enjoyed the bad guys (Max Ryan above the others) in that one for the most part though.
Well, Seagal has reached an all time low with his latest effort, appropriately titled OUT FOR A KILL (a cross between Seagal's OUT FOR JUSTICE and HARD TO KILL). Now I'm not gonna accuse Seagal of ever being able to act but in this one he's worse than ever before. Words roll of his tongue like he's hypnotized and void of all emotion. Not to mention that every time some text appears on the screen to tell you where the characters are, the words look like you've accessed the subtitle button yet you'll hear a sound like it's being typed out on a computer. If you don't know what I mean, you'll see if you're unfortunate enough to actually watch this one. This was the longest ninety-minute movie I have ever laid eyes on and I even had to put the fast forward button to use.
What's funny is, I went into this one expecting a bad movie (like I said before, I saw THE FOREIGNER, not to mention TICKER) and got something far worse. If the writer and director of this trash made more than 99 cents together than some poor producer wasted their cash (ha, Seagal received a producing credit on this one - way to go tough guy). I mean this is way below the caliber of even Seagal's previous bad ones. Poor guy. I don't know if you're supposed to feel sorry for an action hero in a movie but I did. He had to use camera tricks and stand in's to make it seem like he was even punching a guy. Seagal really shouldn't make any more movies. Oh well, as long as he does, I'll probably keep on renting 'em. They're good for a laugh at least.

Unfortunately, I purchased it on DVD (which had no added extras, except trailers) and was really disappointed. I would recommend any of Mr. Seagal's other movies. But not this one. If you are thinking of purchasing it anyway, then please rent it first.",1061337600,,344,4.564516129032258
1898980,4,B00009ZPTZ,"I recently purchased Out For a Kill on DVD. I know it dose not come out on DVD until August 19, but someone on Half.com had it in early, so I bought it. Out for a Kill has the same director as the Foreigner. He did learn his lesson that you need more action in Steven movies! This movie starts off as Robert (seagal) as an archeologists who unearthed artifacts in China with his partner. He discovers that the Chinese mafia the ""Tong"" are using the artifacts to ship drugs in them. He tries to flee, but his partner got killed. The police arest him thinking he killed his partner. He escapes goes back to his house to his wife and tells her that everything is fine. The house blows up with her in there. He then goes OUT FOR A KILL!
Out For a Kill had much more action then the Foreigner, and is more interesting. I would have given this movie 5 stars, but there was something missing. The story is average. There is really nothing special. But the action does make up for it. Out For a Kill is rated ""R"" for Violence, Sexuality/Nudity, Language, and some drug content. I will say that the Foreigner did have one very good explosion, that this movie didnt. They needed to add one huge explosion. When the house explodes with his wife in it, it isn't very good. Combine explosions with this kind of action in this movie, you'll have pure Steven excitement! This is my final verdict:
Acting-8
Action-8
Fun-7
Story-7
Overall- 7
Other movies I would reccomend is Under Seige (1 and 2), Half Past Dead, and Hard to Kill.",1060214400,6,1515,4.375886524822695

7994598,4,B00009ZPTZ,"Any film in which I get to ogle Elaine Tan and Michelle Goh for an hour plus is an automatic 4-stars! I would give it 5 stars, but they kill off Elaine Tan's character within the first few minutes of the film, which is a minus 1 star. Too bad she hasn't been in any other films in America. Michelle Goh you get to ogle for the duration of the film, so that's nice.

Seagal killing the bad guys and studying their hand tattoos for his next clue is both silly and amusing at the same time. This is one of those films you just have to enjoy it for what it is - Saturday B movie with a beer in one hand and ready for a nap.

FINAL GRADE: B+",1333411200,,636,3.8473282442748094
7994599,3,B00009ZPTZ,"This time Seagal plays an archaologist who gets falsely accused of drug smuggling. He gets released because the authorities hope he can lead them to the real smugglers. The Chinese mafia ends up killing his wife and Seagal (who of course turns out to have a hidden past and be an expert at martial arts) sets out to avenge her death.

This was one of Seagal's first direct-to-DVD movies, and the quality of those have been very varied. Unlike some other, ""Out for a Kill"" has a coherent, if unoriginal, plot.  The film offers several action and fighting scenes, including a sword fight. On the other hand it feels cheaper than its alleged $14 million dollar budget. There are some pretty bad acting and some ""cool"" special effects that only feel silly. ""Out for a Kill"" is a silly but watchable B action movie. Very weak 3 star rating.",1287705600,,835,4.597315436241611
7994600,3,B00009ZPTZ,"Steven Segal has probably produced more action films in the last decade than just about anyone.  Regardless of what his critics may say, the man does what he does, and expecting an improvement in the level of quality of his work, is perhaps unrealistic.  If anything, as most of Seagal's recent films have gone the direct to video route, many have come to expect less from Seagal, as age, weight gain, diminished fighting skills, and lower budgets factor into the production.

Out For A Kill (2003) finds Seagal in an atypical role as Robert Burns, an archeologist and expert in Asian artifacts, whose problems begin, when the Tong use artifacts from his dig in China, to smuggle drugs.  In escaping the drug runners, his aide (Elaine Tan) is killed.  Seen as a threat, the Tong then blow up Burn's home in New Haven, Connecticut, taking the life of his wife (Kata Dobo).  Vowing to destroy the gang, the trail takes Burns to Bulgaria, trailed by a pair of narcotics agents, Tommie Ling (Michelle Goh) from Hong Kong, and American DEA agent Ed Grey (Corey Johnson).  From there, the final trail leads to Paris.

The premise to setup the action is shaky like Jell-O, but it is sufficient to set Segal on his mission of revenge, although it is over 28 minutes in before Seagal has his first fight scene!  From there, hell does break loose in a rather fun way.  Seagal appears to do most of the fighting himself, and the action sequences are not bad, with well done editing cuts helping to create the illusion of speed and fluidity.  Segal also does some work with swords, and executes a few of his classic bone snapping maneuvers.  Things like wire work, and slow motion effects, while not realistic, provide a change of pace.  There are a couple of lame action sequences, but overall the action scenes are quite serviceable, and work better than some of Seagal's whispery dialog.

The dark and serious tone is meant to be suspenseful, and while it may be semi-successful at establishing that mood, another result is that dumb plot elements just seem more stupid and humorous.  The villains are very comic book, with the leader Wong Dai (Chooi Kheng Beh) presiding at meeting after meeting, repeatedly pronouncing that the `gwilo' (Burns) must die, as their numbers continue to dwindle.  Ed Grey is a one dimensional know-it-all, and a conflicted and empathetic Tommie Ling becomes Burns ally, and also contributes some non-essential narration.  Burns' final confrontation with Wong Dai, provides a rather anticlimactic conclusion this serviceable action flick.

This revenge tale without a lot of emotion, is probably better than the ratings here or at IMDB indicate.  And being just average, is not necessarily a bad thing for a Seagal film.",1248134400,,2741,4.855913978494623
