3762922,4,B001Q94TRO,"My enduring passion for Brit actor Jeremy Northam is why I tracked down this oddly moving little Anglo-New Zealand film on Netflix Instant View.  Why a film of this caliber is not available in dvd to purchase or even a mail rental sadly speaks volumes about the tastes of the average movie consumer! Nobody does uptight Edwardian better than Jeremy and he excels in this tale about a father and son who try to cope with the war death of a son and brother and the subsequent loss of the wife and mother who dies of grief because of her son's death.

The first rate cast hails from the British Isles and the Antipodes as well.

The plot coincidences were way too-pat for my taste but the 1889 Imperial Tokay continued to flow at Jeremy's to-die-for Arts and Crafts style house complete with Voysey silver serving pieces which kept me engaged.

3762924,5,B001Q94TRO,"This superb film is a wonderful antidote for those looking for a fresh, humouros, touching and beautifully acted period drama.  Althouugh not a Christmas film it would make for marvellous viewing at this time of year.  Filmed mainly in East Anglia it spledidly recreates the Edwardian period (ca. 1905) with lovely interior sets and exterior locations. The cast is marvellous with an outstanding performance by Peter O'Toole.  It is wonderful to see him with such a juicy part at this stage of his career. At the heart of the story is a chasm between a father (O'Toole)and his son (Jeremy Northam). But the manner in which their relationship evolves is totally original involving elements of mysticism and a love of animals - particulalrly dogs. The surrounding cast of Sam Neill, Bryan Brown and Judy Parfitt are each perfect and special in their individual roles.",1291420800,,865,4.993055555555555
3762925,5,B001Q94TRO,"I chanced onto this movie when Starz showed it a few times in late 2009.  The brief description made it sound possibly interesting.  Peter O'Toole.  Dog.  That was enough when I could find nothing else that was worth watching.

How absolutely delightful and enchanting was Dean Spanley?  Enough to search for the DVD and upon finding it was only available in a non-US format, I searched for and bought a multi-region DVD player.

Yes, that's a bit extreme, but my old player was having a few problems and would have needed replacing soon anyway.

Those are the circumstances, and here is the reason Dean Spanley is one of my favorites:

Upon imbibing a certain favored liquor, Dean Spanley (Sam Neill) is able to recall experiences from his past life as a dog.  His reminiscences are delivered with utter sincerity so that what would seem absurd in almost any other instance comes across as not only true but valuable in reaching the locked heart of an aged father (Peter O'Toole) after his elder son's untimely death.  His younger son (Jeremy Northam) listens to Spanley's ramblings with piqued curiosity, which leads him to employ a local broker of goods (Bryan Brown) to acquire more of the rare beverage with which to fortify the Dean.  The convergence of these souls and spirits precedes a denouement that is at once heartrending and magical.",1269907200,8,1347,4.834061135371179
3762926,5,B001Q94TRO,"I saw this movie on cable and watched it twice. I would have watched it again, but it disappeared from my cable company's offerings. The first time I watched it, I couldn't get anyone else in the family interested based on the synopsis provided, which said something like, ""when he drinks a special wine, an eccentric clergyman remembers his former life as a dog!"" It sounded silly to me too, but I was attracted to the stellar cast: Peter O'Toole (Lawrence of Arabia), Jeremy Northam (Emma), Sam Neill (The Piano), Bryan Brown (Breaker Morant), some of the greatest actors of our time. I wondered what could have attracted them to this odd story.

Dean Spanley is listed as a comedy, and there are a few places where it is laugh out loud funny, but it runs the gamut of emotions. The story is revealed rather than merely told. And it is revealed brilliantly. Over the course of the film you discover that in his youth, Old Fisk (Peter O'Toole) had a dog that he deeply loved. It was one of the seven great dogs. (It turns out there are only ever seven at a time.) Sadly, his dog ran away, and he never knew what happened to him. Losing his dog broke his heart, leaving him unable to grieve or fully love. Later in his life, he lost a son in the Boer War but again learned almost nothing of the circumstances of his son's death. Uninformed and unable to grieve, he never got over the tragedy and that gradually drove him and his surviving son (Jeremy Northam) apart.

Enter Dean Spanley (Neill), a clergyman who is haunted by flashes of his former life as a dog. Precipitated by the bouquet of Imperial Tokaj wine, his past life memories are compelling and entertaining. So Northam enlists the help of a conveyancer (Bryan Brown) to obtain rare bottles of the wine so he can delight in the Dean's amusing flashbacks. But as the memories become increasingly poignant, Young Fist senses that his father might benefit from the insights the Dean provides. I won't give away any of the surprises in the plot. I will only say everything in the film is related to everything and everyone else in a way that is deeply moving and rarely achieved in film or in literature. Dogs, people, lives, Thursdays, wine, Cricket, masters and servants are linked together with enlightening grace and elegance.

Some of the associations can be missed on first viewing so I watched it a second time, pleading with my wife to join me. Eventually everyone in my family, like moths to a flame, sat down and watched. We had to start the film over twice as each daughter joined in the viewing, but we didn't mind.

We bought the DVD as soon as it became available. We also purchased a bottle of Tokaj which we enjoyed while we watched the movie. The wine revealed no past life experiences, but our current lives have been made a little richer by this fine and elegant film.",1262649600,20,2845,4.539961013645224
3762927,5,B001Q94TRO,"I concur with the insightful comments made by other reviewers of this film and its commercial release (on DVD in the U.K only, thus far). DEAN SPANLEY is one of the most intelligent and engrossing films I have seen in some time. Based on a book by English author Baron Dunsany, at first glance the story---of a circa 1904 English dean recalling a prior life as a Welsh springer spaniel after a few sips of ""Imperial Tokay"" wine--would seem entirely too slight a skeleton, too odd a subject, on which to base a major movie with some of today's best actors taking significant roles. But director Toa Fraser (and screenplay writer Alan Sharpe), with the superb acting of Peter O'Toole, Sam Neill, Jeremy Northam, Bryan Brown, and Judith Parfitt, not only pull it off, but have created what really is one of the finest classics of modern cinema. Yes, this film is a true ""classic,"" one of those cinematic adventures that towers head above heels above the common run-of-the-mill films that show up in droves these days at the local theatre (or on cable or satellite a little later).

What is noticeable from almost the beginning is the superb dialogue, the ingenious use of the English language. Granted, the film is set in 1904 England, the waning days of the Victorian Age; but, still, from the first it is the superb use of the much-abused English language that imeediately sets this film off as something special, something that wonderfully massages and polishes the language, with beautifal phrasing, delightful idiomatic expressions and memorable ""bon mots.""

Of ocurse, DEAN SPANLEY is a ""high"" comedy, and, as its director and actors insist it is whimsical and light, but whimsy which embraces some serious questions, questions of memory and grief, and the difficulty that can arise in the relations and love between father (O'Toole) and son (Northam). These issues are tactfully and arfully handled, wrapped around by the ""high"" and delightful comedy that carries the day. At times I had to laugh out loud, and at other times, I had tears in my eyes. At the end, I left knowing that I had experienced a true work of cinematic art....

Sam Neill, the Dean Spanley, gives a tuly remarkable performance, both understated and over-the-top, at the same time---an incredible achievement.  Peter O'Toole  plays his curmudgeonly role with panache and obvious relish, and on occasion, steals the show (although Neill is hard to beat). Even lesser roles---the housekeeper/cook, played by Judith Parfitt--are extremely well done and wonderful.

At the moment DEAN SPANLEY only exists in the PAL format; it was one of the reasons I ordered an ""all regions"" Sony DVD player from a reputable supplier is Illinois....you can purchase one for around $60-$70, and it is well worth it (not to mention a number of BBC and other items not currently available in the American NTSC format---one wonders why ALL DVD players are not ""all regions""?). In any case, it is well worth purchasing an all regions/PAL player to view this film.

DEAN SPANLEY is a true gem, a classic that should rank with some of the finest cimema of recent years. I recommend it very highly, for its very clever and well-done humor, its superb ensemble acting, its cinematography, its direction, and, not the least, its integration of pathos within a lighter framework.  A marvelous film that will repay repeated viewing....",1258761600,17,3380,4.938380281690141
3762928,5,B001Q94TRO,"This movie is delightful - great acting, surprising tale, and quirky characters. Peter O' Toole and Sam Neale are in top form, and it really is a memorable movie that was my most enjoyable movie for 2009.",1257292800,4,204,4.54054054054054
3762929,5,B001Q94TRO,"DEAN SPANLEY is a film with elements of drama, comedy and fantasy, a joint British-New Zealand production based on a 1936 novella by Lord Dunsany. It was directed by New Zealander Toa Fraser and stars Peter O'Toole, Jeremy Northam, Sam Neill, and Bryan Brown, with an original soundtrack by New Zealander Don McGlashan.

The story is worth summarizing: O'Toole plays the curmudgeonly Horatio Fisk, a widower who inflicts his foul moods on everyone near him. His son, Henslowe Fisk (Northam), bravely visits his father once a week. Desperate for something different to do with the impossible-to-please old man, Fisk Junior suggests a lecture about the transmigration of souls. At that event the Fisks meet Dean Spanley (Neill), a local churchman. Henslowe strikes up an association with the eccentric Spanley and discovers that the Dean has a passion for a rare Hungarian wine. While under its spell, the Dean reveals details of his previous incarnation -- as a dog.

How does this incredible story link to the elderly Fisk's youth? The tale plays out and the old man taps into the love and emotion of his younger life, breaking through his crusty defenses.

The film's setting in Edwardian England gives lots of scope for sombre but elegant costuming and moody night scenes--and eccentric characters. O'Toole, Northam and Neill are marvelous; the entire production is classy and mesmerizing. I was enchanted by this movie when I chose it from the menu on a trans-Pacific flight. It had successful pre-release showings at film festivals in Toronto, London and Korea, and it recently won Best Film and six other categories in the New Zealand Film and TV Awards. The distribution of DEAN SPANLEY in the US is limited, and at this time Amazon carries only the PAL/Region 2 format which won't play on standard North American equipment.

If you haven't seen this unusual and charming film--and you probably haven't--you should do yourself a favor and find it. It's a labor of love by talented people with a passionate commitment to film-making, and the viewer's reward is an escape to a world where we find ourselves (like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland) believing ""six impossible things before breakfast.""

3762931,5,B001Q94TRO,"""Dean Spanley"" is that rarity - a weird little film that you think is going to be absolute rubbish at first, but then twists and turns and delightfully works itself out. The script - based on the 1936 book by Lord Dunsany called ""My Talks With Dean Spanley""  - is adapted and expanded by top British writer Alan Sharp - and is about loss and reincarnation, but in a very strange roundabout kind of way...

Peter O'Toole plays the elderly English gentleman Horatio Fisk - who is visited every Thursday by his punctual son (Jeremy Northam). Set in affluent Edwardian London, their meets are convivial rather than warm - and of late - increasingly spiked.  Fisk Junior feels dutiful rather than loving towards his 'near-to-the-end' Dad - and their tit-for-tat word battles and mind games are eating him up. Something has distanced them - and worse - turned his father into a boor - a man who you suspect was once very kind, but now isn't.

Fisk Junior longs of course for a real father and son relationship - free of the bickering and incessant quips - but more than that - he longs for his father to get to the core of the problem - open up and talk about his other son's loss in the recent Boer war. The no-nonsense housekeeper Mrs. Brimley (played so subtly by Judy Parfitt) hardly knows what to say or do anymore - and just stoically gets on with it - real talking just isn't done in educated circles...

By chance into the equation comes the equally awkward and stuffy man of the cloth Dean Spanley - played beautifully by Sam Neill (easily his most difficult and wordy role to date). The Dean seems odd - even a bit nutty - and may or may not harbour dangerous views about reincarnation for a man of a very fixed religion. Enter another Australian Bryan Brown who can procure anything - including the Dean's craved favourite tipple - a rare Imperial wine that sends the cleric into near rapture - a few drops of this stuff in the Dean's veins and things start to happen...and without giving too much away...on the story goes...

While O'Toole is typically magisterial and impressive in his role - as you would expect of such a quality guy - it's Sam Neill who is revelatory. There are sequences (especially towards the end) where his dialogue passages are enormous - and he carries them off with style - even actually carrying the movie itself.

This is the second feature film by New Zealand Director Toa Fraser (""No. 2"" was his first) and from the interviews in the extras section, Toa 'knows' he got lucky with such a Grade-A cast of actors. O'Toole's interview is witty, intelligent, perceptive - all the things you suspect he is in real life - while poor Sam Neil seems genuinely tortured when asked to speak - like someone is pulling his teeth. Bryan Brown and Jeremy Northam just seem to be enjoying themselves - involved in a film they know to be a little sweetheart.

""Dean Spanley"" was a lovely surprise - and genuinely uplifting. Buy it or rent it soon. Highly recommended.

PS: Although shot in hi-def, it hasn't been issued on either Blu Ray or on a Region 1 disc - so the Region 2 DVD is presently the only way to get your hands on this film (you'll need a multi-region player).",1244246400,44,3195,4.504317789291883

Unfortunately the film is not available on DVD in the US but fortunately can be seen free of charge on Netflix or pay-per-view on Amazon.com.

Please realize upfront that Dean Spanley is a modestly budgeted, leisurely paced film, and at a glance, might pass for a turn-of-the-century English drama/comedy of manners but know that it isn't.

The humor is not central to the film and it is not a laugh out loud funny film, although it is full of humorous eccentric moments and dialogue that will make you smile.  Turn on the subtitles if they are available as occasionally some of the British pronunciation might get passed American ears. I found that ninety-five percent of the dialogue was completely understandable.  Despite the setting, eccentricities and humor in the film, the movie ends up being a touching story of love, loyalty, second chances, understanding and reconciliation.

The acting is superb by the entire cast.  Particularly noteworthy were Peter O'tool's portrayal of an aloof, standoffish, manipulative close minded patriarch and Sam Neal as a seemingly stoic, open minded clergyman who has access to a very unusual view of the world. These two men had to deliver the most challenging performances and were superb, but that should not take anything away from the rest of the cast. Jeremy Northam and Bryan Brown, Judy Parfitt, and Dudley Sutton who were all top notch.

I was surprised to see that Sam Neal could deliver the type of delicate characterization that he pulls off.  He is a far superior actor then I had ever thought.  I believe he makes the movie.  His long eloquent speeches about his former life and his observations on how a dog views the world are mesmerizing. Peter O'tools open mouth, wide eyed reactions to those speeches were moving.

There was also a fine musical score by Don McGlashan, great script and dialogue, beautiful photography, excellent sets, costumes, and authentic paraphernalia such as old cars and horse drawn carriages that fits the early late 1800s, early 1900s time period of the film. Of course, its also nearly perfectly directed by Toa Fraser.

As far as the plot goes, there is a plot, its unusual, and I think may be completely original.  Unfortunately I am not going to spoil the film by mentioning anything about plot, you must see for yourself.

The film is ultimately not really about dogs, but a dogs world plays a crucial part of the film.  The film would not exist without them.

Four stars may be a more accurate rating for this film.  I gave Dean Spanley five stars for personal reasons, one being my own love of dogs and the greater understanding of their inner nature that came from this film, and the films analogy on the love of our pets with the love of our family and friends.  For Me, Dean Spanely also gives a very logical explanation of a dogs emotions, choices and directions as it views the wonderful world around himself.

I will be looking forward to director Toa Fraser's next film.",1433030400,2,3054,4.825335892514396

3763036,5,B001Q94TRO,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview(dot)com says: What a wonderfully odd heart-warming film...Dean Spanley takes a moment to get rolling. But, when it does, your inner child will be giddy with glee.

Story goes...A swami has a soiree on the theory of past lives in which several local townsfolk of a Victorian English village attend. Four are to be our players for the film before us: crotchety old mean-as-a-wasp Fisk Senior (Peter O'Toole), his son Young Fisk (Jeremy Northam), a man who can get what you want for a price, Wrather ( Bryan Brown) and Dean ""Wag"" Spanley (Sam Neill).

After Young Fisk invites Dean Spanley for a drink the story blossoms (give it time). Seems when the upstanding Dean indulges in a very specific aperitif its nectar sends him deep into the recesses of his subconscious - where his past life, as a dog, peaks through.

Young Fisk steps into the whole phenom with a healthy skeptic's eye. But after chats with the rascal Wrather, seizes this opportunity to continually inebriate the good Dean and delve into the story of the young dog he once was; and here, that is no innuendo.

The result is so touching it borders on sappy. But, once in a while you need a shot of happy-time fables that come sans underworld tweens or loud steadycam-filled bullet-filled ballets...

The Dean Spanley film is based on the very beloved book by Lord Dunsany - a fantasy writer well known to Brits, and an in-the-know author for literary hounds. So, you'll watch the opening credits wondering, ""Where did that intro go?"" but, the decision was no doubt due to the entirety of the author's work, not this story; as the contents are grown up enjoyment-geared and unlike Lemony Snicket as the artworks mislead...odd choice, but there you go. Sadly, you have to invest in the film to enjoy it; it's a good  way in by the time it grabs you...but, you may find the wait worth the time if you are a film enthusiast over the age of say 30.

Peter O'Toole was an acting treasure (he has passed since the film's release). Here he makes his task of fussbug look easy. But, the range of emotions and the subtly with which he lays them down, will have you gobsmacked.

Jeremy Northam , looking adorable as ever, plays the dowdy awestruck Young Fisk with a close hand. A wonderful performance.

But the star, in name and performance, goes to the remarkably handsome, Sam Neill. His stepping into the skin of a once-dog is superb. The past life ""slips"" delivered masterfully. You may laugh aloud as he sniffs a new friend or has, frankly, his orgasmic-like reactions to a libation as the others look on in magnificent awe.

Dean Spanley is a fairy tale. And, if you're a dog lover, hell, an animal lover, you may want to buy this if it ever gets international dvd coverage; right now, enjoy on Netflix or Amazon Video.

Many viewers seem to share my opinion, and there is no need for me to repeat the story line or to laud the performances (every one a gem).

How many young people today are introduced to subjects like reincarnation or the Boer War?  How many care for really clever dialog as opposed to vulgarities?

3763049,5,B001Q94TRO,"For a saddened and stoic Young Fisk (Jeremy Northam), the weekly Thursday visits with his arrogant and caustic father, Horatio (Peter O'Toole), have become more of a chore rather than anything anticipated.  He has begun these regular get-togethers since his brother's death in the Boer War and his mother's demise directly following from her unassailable grief.  Horatio is an over the top toxic curmudgeon.  A man that remains tight-lipped for a discussion about Young Fisk's brother (Harrington) or mother, although has an opinion on everything else; everything.  So be ready as you will hear him often shouting out - ""Poppycock"".

Set in a lovely circa 1904 England, directed by Toa Fraser based on the book by Lord Dunsany with the original title being, ""My Talks with Dean Spanley"".  Given over to a brilliantly original screenplay by Alan Sharp, we are treated to a magical story totally built into the narrative of a dynamic cast.  Much of what may be presented at the outset is not necessarily going to be how this all plays out into the wonder of restoring something emotionally written in Horatio Fisk's psyche.  With the power of words, we see how so many occurrences are interconnected then restored.  Telling too much of the plot would be like opening a box of magic and watching it just blow away.  Not expressing too much is allowing this entire magical tale to hit you squarely in your heart when it comes to fruition for you.  I stumbled on this movie quite by happenstance, was immediately caught up in its succulent dialogue being completely engrossing and amazing, rendering me unable to leave my seat ... By the end, I was dazzled but mainly speechless.

On this particular Thursday, Young Fisk thought he would take his father out of the house (mainly to ease his own boredom), through the square in his wheelchair to an interesting looking lecture he had spied in the morning's newspaper.  The title of the talk, by Swami Nala Prash, was The Transmigration of Souls, which was a very intriguing concept at the time and to the small audience gathered there.  It was here that Horatio meets the local clergyman, Dean Spanley (Sam Neill) who says to Young Fisk, ""Only the closed mind is certain"".  He is a very curious gentleman who is intricately familiar with this topic and has flashbacks during his life.  At later times, he gets very talkative when given a specific fine Hungarian wine, so the younger Fisk continually keeps him in his cups while they are together.  He finds this elixir, which is very difficult to locate, from Wrather (Bryan Brown), who claims his ""Auntie was a hoarder"" and he can get his hands on anything.  Between Young Fisk and now Wrather finding this special wine and getting it to the Dean, we hear a story from Dean Spanley that goes well beyond fantastic, something that kept me glued to my seat and smiling from ear to ear.  It had me laughing some of the time and it also sounded like beautiful spoken poetry.  Sam Neill's command of his narrative was pure genius and I swore I could see Peter O'Toole's soul right through his eyes.  His face wears each emotion as conclusions begin to make sense for this once cantankerous old man.  This movie, ""Dean Spanley"", is so up there now as one of my absolute favorite movies.  I cannot wait to own this unrivaled story.

As for Sam Neill, I have never seen him give such an animated and brilliant portrayal. Any of his fans wouldn't want to miss this one. If you enjoy brilliant dialogue done with finesse and emotion, you will love this heartwarming and plausible-(You decide) story.",1402704000,4,3584,4.752827140549273

This is a delightful and whimsical film that is also very moving. To explain the plot would leave many saying 'whaaaa?' so I won't try because I can't do the experience justice by explaining the plot. What *happens*, on the other hand, is pure magic that softens the heart and heals old and new wounds. As others have written, the acting by everyone is superb but I have to particularly note absolutely awesome work by Peter O'Toole. There are long stretches of the film where he has no dialogue at all -- someone else is talking -- but his face commands the screen because it is a mesmerizing image of childlike delight. He simply *is* the jaded old man rediscovering joy and making peace with loss. This film is soooo worth your time, especially on a quiet evening with a cup of tea, a glass of wine -- or, better yet -- tokay.",1402272000,,974,4.386740331491713

Then in the second half, I started catching on. Then I got hit with an emotional bomb, since I am an intense dog lover (and I own a SPANIEL). This is not a dog movie, exactly, so don't think that. It's hard to explain.  Of course, I missed a lot of the meaning, since I hadn't paid close attention in the first half. But I caught enough, since the movie stayed with me, haunted me, got into my head, and I think changed forever the way I view my dogs and the way I view adventurers who risk it all and lose. This movie made me cry. I want to watch it again (need to watch it again?), to pick up the details I missed the first time. I hate to go through the emotion again, but this is such a fine movie, that it will be worth it. The acting is first rate. At one point you have Sam Neill, Bryan Brown, Jeremy Northam, and Peter O'Toole, all sitting 'round and acting their finest in one of the best scenes in the movie. The plot is original (how does someone come up with this idea, and then actually write it?). The acting, as I said, is first rate. The script uses language in a way that is rare these days. I highly recommend this movie for people who like movies that make them think, and who appreciate characterization, subtlety, high level acting. I wish more movies like this were made.

3763056,5,B001Q94TRO,"From the novel ""My Talks With Dean Spanley"" by Lord Dunsany, screenplay by Alan Sharp, Jeremy Northam stars as Henslow Fisk, the dutiful surviving son of an elderly father (Peter O'Toole) left emotionally numb by the loss of his older son in the Boer War and the subsequent death of his wife.  Their relationship is shaken when they attend a lecture on reincarnation. Sam Neill is the title character, a cleric with an interesting possible past life which sheds light on the father's character.  Bryan Brown takes a fun turn as the ""conveyancer,"" a man who can obtain any item anyone could want.  Judy Parfitt is the long-suffering housekeeper who has seen the father through thick and thin.

Directed with a lot of heart by Toa Fraser and scored with powerful music by Don McGlashan.  Northam gives a wonderfully nuanced performance.  O'Toole brought me to tears as the father's full story came to light. Neill delightfully reveals characteristics of the possible past individual behind the present man of ""gravitas.""

3763073,4,B001Q94TRO,"There are some number of these types of films out there and I'm continually surprised at how good they can be and how often I enjoy them. This is as good as most that I've seen.

Here's the scoop. Set in New Zealand in the 1930's, Fisk Junior (Jeremy Northam) visits his cold and rather cantankerous father (Peter O'Toole) every Thursday and takes him to some local happening. This week it's to see an Indian Swami speak about the transmigration of souls. They run across Dean (the position not the name) Spanley (Sam Neiil) and a conveyor (Bryon Brown). Fisk runs into Spanley two more times and feels this is too much a coincidence and invites him to dinner with the promise of producing a bottle of Tokay (the Dean's favorite spirit). The Dean imbibes the Tokay and begins to reminisce about a previous life where, it appears, he might have been a dog. This changes the whole dynamic of the relationships between the four men.

This is a very whimsical film. The whole idea seems preposterous on the surface but they make it work. Hints of the Dean being a dog in a previous life are hinted at early on, but the clues keep building, and when you hear him speak from a dog's perspective you're in hook, line and sinker. The way the Dean's story unfolds and begins to dovetail into those of the other men really starts pulling on the heartstrings. But this is no sappy stuff. Maybe it's your feeling for these people that gives it such gravity. It's a beautifully shot film. Both the exteriors and interiors are gorgeous and give a great feeling of the period. The performances are good. I've grown tired of Sam Neill and Bryon Brown over the years but both turn in fine performances. The real pleasure is O'Toole. His transformation by the end of the movie drives home everything that came before. After all these years he's still got it.

This is a clever, heartwarming movie. If you need something to reinstate your confidence in people, this should do it.",1374796800,,1960,4.578347578347579

It is slow but stick with it.  The final scene...the dinner of the four men is worth the wait.  The Dean is telling an adventure he had in his past life as a dog. The film inserted footage of a dog running with his friend in a field.  It was incredibly moving.  Best of all was the face of Peter O'Toole as he listened to this fantastic story.

3763097,5,B001Q94TRO,"A remarkable treasure for dog-lovers, whimsical dreamers, and philosophers alike. Perhaps even the odd cat fancier could appreciate its charms; animosity between cats and dogs is humorously depicted. I don't understand why this beautifully filmed, surprisingly profound story isn't more widely known, a gem bought to life via a collaboration of British and New Zealander talents. It's directed by New Zealander Toa Fraser, and boasts a superb script by British writer Alan Sharp, with his adaptation of Irish author Lord Dunsany's ""My Talks with Dean Spanley.""

Sam Neill is superb as the Dean, with his finely nuanced performance as a respectable Edwardian English cleric who remarkably can recall his past life when plied with ample quantities of golden Hungarian Tokay wine. I enjoy first-person narratives, and Jeremy Northam is superb as Henslowe Fisk. His curmudgeon father (the inimitable Peter O'Toole), Fisk Senior, brusquely calls him Fisk Junior on his son's regular Thursday visits. Father and son suffer from prolonged grief from the loss of Henslowe's younger brother Harrington (Xavier Horan), who was killed in the 2nd Anglo-Boer War. His mother was felled by this loss, dying shortly after, and Fisk Junior blames his father for his mother's premature death. She had no one to turn to in her husband; his feelings are closed.

In an attempt to entertain the brittle and caustic Old Man, Fisk Junior wheels him out one autumn afternoon, while leaves blow like memories across sidewalks, to a lecture by swami (Art Malik). The subject is the transmigration of souls, or reincarnation. Talks of this type and the occult fascinated the British public after waves of war and loss. The lecture is attended by local clergyman, Dean Spanley (Sam Neill). The swami seems to pull thoughts out of the heads of his audience, especially old Fisk Senior and Dean Spanley, much to the umbrage of two ladies who love cats. Later, at their Gentleman's Club, Fisk Junior speaks with Dean Spanley, and something the Dean says about the complexity of spiritual reality prompts Fisk Junior to want to further his acquaintance. The Dean has a pronounced fondness for Tokay, so as his bargaining tool, Fisk turns to Wrather (Bryan Brown), another gentleman at the lecture, who is a ""procure,"" to acquire this rare delight.

And then the story takes off, wandering to paths both wondrous and mysterious. Judy Parfitt, as house keeper Mrs. Brimley, is also wonderful.  O'Toole masterfully depicts the slow crumbling of cold Fisk's brittle, cold persona in the face of the numinous. It's hard to describe how moving these scenes are, set around a crackling fire in an Edwardian town-home, and then moving to the trampings of dogs. All the listeners are entranced, as the rich memories unfold. Even Wrather discovers something about himself. A breakthrough not unlike Scrooge's caused an immense change in Fisk Senior, and for the first time, love and understanding draw father and son together, when the wound of grief is finally opened to comfort. This is a story that pleases the imagination, and is surprisingly meaningful, whatever the truth of dogs, life, death, and beyond. Enjoy!

Though set in another time-period altogether, for those of you willing to on a wild, uncanny ride into rough 1970s-era England, I also highly recommend this British series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-On-Mars-The-Complete-Collection-U-K/dp/B0038M2SAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life On Mars: The Complete Collection (U.K.)</a>.",1355184000,3,3558,5.415162454873646

Dean Spanley is a rector who enjoys a certain liquor and as soon as he begins to imbibe his mind returns to his previous life as a dog.  It may sound silly, but the tone, writing, and direction of this film do not permit  even a moment of irony or camp to seep in.  Sam Neill does a masterful job as both bourgeois rector and adventurous hound reminiscing over a life that apparently ended right before his incarnation as a man.  There are no twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat; rather the viewer is walked gently through the story until the inevitable end. Peter O'Toole is both irascible and pathetic as the aged father of Jeremy Northam, the son who performs his filial duty without any seeming gratitude from the old man.  Their encounters with Dean Spanley and a fellow who imports exotic goods drive the movie forward beautifully.  The end is gorgeous on so many levels.

Positives:
The magic in this story is not in the reincarnation hypothesis but in the storytelling. Like all good storytellings one becomes more trapped, engaged and enthralled as the story unfolds. To me the most significant moment occurs, not when Fisk senior is playing with the dog at the end, but just prior when Fisk Sr., Fisk Jr. and Wrather sit in the drawing room, spellbound and transformed by Dean's tale.

When they enter the house, a man is playing ""Jerusalem"" on the sitar.  This is monstrously funny, but only if you know the significance of the tune to the English.

3763131,5,B001Q94TRO,"Dean Spanley is now my favorite film.  Although I have not read the book upon which it was based (My Talks With Dean Spanley by Lord Dunsany), I can say that the movie stands on its own in its perfection.

The interaction among the characters is lively, amusing, tender and satisfying.  Peter O'Toole is Horatio Fisk, a widower who lives alone except for a housekeeper, is dutifully visited every Thursday by his obedient son, Henslowe Fisk (""Young Fisk"" as his father calls him played by Jeremy Northam). The elder Mr. Fisk is thoroughly set in his ways and constantly dominates his son showing traits ranging from fussy, demanding, outspoken and irritating to amusing and charming.

The subdued and put-upon Young Fisk takes his father to a lecture on reincarnation in an attempt to find amusement among several dull activity choices.  They meet Mr. Wrather (Bryan Brown) who is a ""conveyancer"" who finds people whatever unusual item for which they are searching and Dean Spanley (Sam Neill), a member of the clergy of the Anglican Church. When taking holy orders, the name changed from his given name (Walter Arthur Graham) to Dean (a title).  This subject comes up later in the film an interesting coincidence. (This information is from the film and I apologize that I can no better explain Anglican Church leader hierarchies or titles.)

The father and son go to the gentleman's club for a drink where they again encounter Dean Spanley who is enjoying a glass of Tokay (a sweet Hungarian wine which is VERY DIFFICULT to acquire).  Horatio intrudes upon the Dean's solitude with an introduction and questions then leaves abruptly.  Henslowe apologizes for his father's impulsive behavior.

Henslowe encounters Dean Spanley a third time on his way home when he sees the dean looking at a cat that run up a tree and invites the dean to dinner, interested in hearing more about his ideas on reincarnation.  When the dean hesitates, Henslowe entices him by saying he has a bottle of Imperial Tokay.

The dean chooses Thursday for the dinner, which changes the Fisks' regular routine. Henslowe is frustrated by his father's manipulation and reluctance to discuss the death of Henslowe's brother in the Boer War or the subsequent death of his mother from grief. Young Fisk was looking for some kind of change.

After an unsuccessful search for the rare wine that he promised Dean Spanley, Henslowe calls upon his new acquaintance, Mr. Wrather, who just happens to have a bottle of the desired wine for a very high price. Wrather is a collector of just about anything that someone might pay for and willing to procure anything he doesn't have on hand.

Although somewhat regretting his decision to invite the dean for dinner due to the high cost of the Tokay and his lessening interest in reincarnation, he and the dean eat dinner with somewhat awkward conversation - until the Tokay is presented.  Dean Spanley enjoys the aroma of the wine and wishes that at times like this, ""one could possess the olfactory senses of the canine.""  After drinking Tokay, the dean becomes animated and chatty but the subject matter is confusing to Henslowe.  It appears that the dean recalls a previous life as a dog while under the influence of Tokay.

Anyone who has every had a dog for a companion will be caught up in all the descriptions of canine thought and behavior from a human who might have been a dog in a previous life.  The philosophy should not offend anyone's belief system.  It does set up a remarkable way of storytelling and bringing the characters into a peculiar, fascinating interaction.

Without giving away any of the surprises and coincidences that follow, I can say that the story continues to be at times hilarious, at times delightfully sentimental.  If you like dogs, you cannot miss seeing this!!!

If you are interested in the interactions of new friends from such different backgrounds that they never would have met except by chance and interested in how a distant father-son relationship can evolve, you will enjoy Dean Spanley.

Speaking from personal experience: if you have ever had a parent that you dearly loved but whose annoying traits such as talking out loud when everyone else is quiet or bringing up embarrassing topics around strangers despite repeated ""shushing"", you will feel a special admiration for Peter O'Toole's portrayal.

There is no down side to this film except that it shouldn't ever end.  Please take a chance on this quirky, humorous, heart-warming, wonderful film. Peter O'Toole can't be topped, Bryan Brown is amazing with his perfect comedic timing and Jeremy Northam has never been better. Sam Neill is tremendous - convincing as dean or dog!!",1316563200,12,4689,4.91128010139417

Based on the novel 'My Talks with Dean Spanley' by the colorful writer Lord Dunsany (Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, July 24, 1878 in London, England, UK - October 25, 1957 (age 79) in Dublin, Ireland) and adapted for the screen with great dexterity and gentility by Alan Sharp, the story is a study in the meaning of reincarnation in the most delightful sense of the term!

Set in Edwardian England where upper lips are always stiff and men from the Colonies are not entirely to be trusted, Fisk Senior (Peter O'Toole) is caustic, nihilistic has little time or affection for his son Fisk Junior (Jeremy Northam) - they visit only on Thursdays and then in only the most routine of circumstances: even the housekeeper Mrs. Brimley (Judy Parfitt) knows to only fix one boring Hot Pot for them to eat.  Fisk Senior seems to have placed all his hopes on his other son who was killed in the Boer War of 1899 to 1902. Fisk Junior encouraged by his friend Wrather (Bryan Brown) breaks tradition and takes his father to a talk by the guru Nawab of Ranjiput (Ramon Tikaram) where they hear about the Indian concept of reincarnation and the inferiority of cats. The lecture is attended also by a vicar named Dean Spanley (Sam Neill) and what follows is a series of conversations and revelations over glasses of Tokay that seem to open up the vicar's remembrance of past lives - a fact that eventually  relates to Fisk Senior and manages to change the grumpy old man's outlook on life.

Directed by Toa Fraser with terrific atmosphere and Edwardian elegance, the actors are all superb, but one of the most satisfying aspects of this film is simply hearing a screenplay of perfect English spoken symphonically.  It is a thoroughly delightful film on every level.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, September 11",1315872000,,2146,4.721925133689839

3763134,5,B001Q94TRO,"This enchanting little tale has everything and it's difficult to spotlight any one factor that makes it so appealing.  The writing is superb, and Peter O'Toole, Jeremy Northam, Bryan Brown and Sam Neill act the story perfectly. There's magic in seeing four really fine actors (five if you count Judy Parfitt's lovely performance) having the times of their lives.  Dean Spanley is magic.

Horatio Fiske (O'Toole) is an unhappy old man whose sole ambition is to make everyone around him as miserable as he is.  He has reason to be bitter.  His other son disappeared during the Boer War and is presumed dead.  It's not the first time the elder Fiske has suffered a similar loss.  His beloved childhood dog had disappeared many, many years previously and he'd never gotten over it.

Young Fiske, as his impossible father calls him, is a dutiful son.  He sees his father every Thursday (""Useful day, Thursday,"" his father says.  ""Keeps Wednesday and Friday from colliding."") despite the elder Fiske's bitter acerbity.  Desperate for an outing, the two Fiskes go to a lecture on the transmigration of souls given by a Swami played with relish by Art Malik.  They meet Dean Spanley both at the lecture and at the Fiske's club where they retire after the lecture.  The Dean is particularly partial to a rare Hungarian wine, Imperial Tokay.  Young Fiske is intrigued by some of the Dean's remarks and uses the Imperial Tokay to entice him to a series of dinners.  What happens at these dinners is transformative for everyone involved--except maybe the Dean.

This is a character driven movie, and its slow start is necessary to firmly establish everyone's relationships with the world and each other.  It's necessary to have faith that such fine actors would not waste their time on drivel.  They don't. The payoff is spectacular; moving and joyous. Dean Spanley is a pure delight.",1315353600,2,1872,4.888888888888889

As it turned out, we got to watch gob-smackingly subtle and powerful performances from all four of them in a story that stays with me and has coined a regular phrase in our household.

The film starts in a very leisurely fashion and, in fact, pretty much continues that way and for a long period one wonders if it's going to be much more than one of those Brit character studies that BBC and PBS knew wouldn't pull an audience so they didn't bother. If you have patience, however, it becomes a touching and complex work about love between men and their dogs, love and loss between fathers and sons, and, yes, life, death, and the possibility of the transmigration of souls.

Clich though it sounds, if you love or ever have loved a dog, or lost a loved one, this film will have tears in your eyes before it's over. And you'll understand the phrase I referred to above: ""Just our luck, he's a slow reader.""",1313193600,3,1076,4.375

3763154,5,B001Q94TRO,":wipes a tear: Dean Spanley was thoroughly enjoyable.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Once the subject of reincarnation came on board, I wondered if the movie was a religious push toward this belief.  However, I bucked up my Christian thought for the moment and was swept into a very tender story of father, son, and dog.

Jeremy Northam, as far as I'm concerned, can do no wrong.  The man is such a great actor.  He really brings you into his frustration and pain of the relationship with his father.  Angela Clerkin, Bryan Brown, Peter O'Toole, and Sam Neill were all wonderful.  Peter, of course, the father, plays a gruff man with no feelings and a hard core. Sam Neill is great as the man with a prior life as a dog, and his recalling of being a dog was heartwarming to say the least.  Cats did not get top billing, but I still love mine.  LOL

3763156,5,B001Q94TRO,"I watched it only because of the prominence of Tokay, a Hungarian wine I am partial to. What I found was an unexpected pleasure filled with layers of relationship, mystery and myth, each intertwining with the other. It is one of the most subtle, best-written movies I have seen in years.

The Tokay was a clever literary device. Curious about the afterlife and what Dean Spanley might think of reincarnation, Henslowe Fisk uses a good quality, very rare Tokay to tempt the Dean over for dinner. Conversation ensues intriguing Fisk, and more Tokay is procured, rarer than the first bottle.

Its unique sweet aroma draws out the Dean to remember a life much earlier than his own. He tastes it, smells it, and finds the kind of ecstasy only the best of memories can supply. He tells Fisk, and later, the resourceful supplier of the wine, Wrather, in subsequent dinners.

The real story is the complex perspective Fisk has with his father. He has never connected well with him, and now, as his father ages, both recognize an emptiness. Father and son each see what is missing, but can neither name it, nor, more importantly, find a way back. Instead, they maintain a kind of austere, but familial companionship.

Wrather, at first, seems to be just a way to move the plot along. However, as the story develops, he not only becomes crucial, but is foundational at each stage of the tale.

The fine acting of Peter O'Toole, Sam Neill, Jeremy Northam, and Bryan Brown cannot be overstated. Carefully directed, and intelligently filmed, we see each character used with intensity, but always modestly. No one overacts in what might have been a maudlin film.

The packaging makes it look something like a Disney dog film. It is not. It carries a rich social wisdom, original storytelling, and a depth of insight into father-son dynamics.

I fully recommend, ""Dean Spanley.""

3763157,5,B001Q94TRO,"Well what a prize of a movie, Dean Spanley was! And produced by those Kiwi's down under (or at the true top of the world, as my dear friend Andy in Wellington would say).  While plentifully punctuated with humorous witticisms and one liners, I would not classify the movie as first being a comedy.  For me, it was instead, my absolutely favorite genre of all, redemption and reconciliation.  What a gem!  While many would say (myself included) that theologically, the story was a bit twisted, it worked quite well simply by temporarily employing a 'suspension of disbelief'.  With that in play, one can expectantly respond to the conductor's ""All aboard!"" cry and take off on a fantasy journey of many pleasures.  First rate acting and a fascinating story line kept me glued in place and, in fact, put me back in line for a repeat journey.  When Spanley (the name deliberately suggestive of Spaniel?), at the final dinner gathering elaborated on his previous canine adventures and times with the Master, the film moved seductively into the poetic realm.  That segment should have the power to moisten the eyes of all but the most callous of humankind.  What a cinematic feast!

Some of my favorite witticisms and one liners:

""Very handy, a Thursday.  Keeps Wednesday and Friday from colliding.""

""Diversions are all that's left before stepping out of the ante-room to eternity.""

""Did we win the (Boer) war?""  ""I believe we lost more slowly than the other side.""

""Only the closed mind is certain.""

""I've heard it said that one encounter is a happenstance, two a coincidence and three a significance.""

""I wouldn't call it a lie but more like a truth deferred, as it were.""

""'These little things were sent to try us' said the man of the pygmy judge.""

""There is no point to regret things that have gone to the trouble of happening.""

""It's often occurred to me that pulling a dog away from a lamppost is akin to seizing a scholar at the British Museum by the scruff of his neck and dragging him away from his studies.""

""At such times, one could wish for the olfactory powers of a canine.""

""'It may look like a boat, but it doesn't float', my mother used to say to me.""
