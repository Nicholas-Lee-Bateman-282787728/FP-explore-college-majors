6308161,3,B00J0BTELQ,"It`s a nice package...But too much re-enactments....I want to see real footage...not some actor playing the part.  During the Luciano segment...They didn`t even mention Bugsy Siegel...and he was in on the killings of masseria and maranzano.....Lucky/ Lansky/ and Bugsy were close back then....No CD on Bugsy either...?  They do segments on Allen Dorfman (Who Cares)...and Donnie Brasco...and Roy Demeo...But Not Bugsy?  It`s ok, but not great.",1468800000,3,443,5.681818181818182

6308163,3,B00J0BTELQ,"This purchase was a major disappointment.  The written material is good.  However, the discs provide very little new or interesting information and the background is mostly modern-day shots of traffic with electronic signboards and modern high-rise buildings.",1464739200,,259,5.972972972972973

8647001,5,B00J0BTELQ,"While incomplete and disjointed as a history of the mob, the six DVDs were very good (including an appropriate use of reenactments) and included much new information.  The Anthony Hopkins soundalike narrator was fine (betraying at times that this set must've been originally created for a British audience).

Watching these DVDs will leave you with no sense of glamour, portraying a bunch of vicious killers (typically none too smart).",1476144000,,435,5.2898550724637685
