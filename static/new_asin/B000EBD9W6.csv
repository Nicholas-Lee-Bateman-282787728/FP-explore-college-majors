2512345,1,B000EBD9W6,"We were all very disappointed with these DVDs.

They were FULL of evolution.  Too bad that the

beautiful photography wasn't just shown with

descriptions of the the little critters.  The

evolution was throughout...couldn't just skip

a few spots.  Just wanted to notify other

Creationists.",1150848000,35,292,5.454545454545454
2512346,5,B000EBD9W6,"This is a beautiful documentary series. Sir David Attenborough's latest release is a 5-part documentary on terrestrial invertebrates (as opposed to marine invertebrates which are not covered here) with a major emphasis on insects and to a lesser extent, spiders, with a passing glance at snails, slugs and worms which actually only feature in the first episode. While many of the species he showcases can be found in and around your neighbourhood gardens, he still criss-crosses the globe to highlight the diversity of forms and habitats that related species occupy across our planet. He is helped by advances in photography, especially ultra-high-speed photography, microphotography and high-resolution infra-red photography and the new high-definition video which can present it in such spectacular detail on DVD. These highly detailed images are truly gorgeous to look at and make you wish this series was at least twice as long.

The 5 episodes (50 mins each) are:
Ep 1: Invasion of the land - A very brief description of how the invertebrates moved from water to land and the adaptations they underwent during the transition.
Ep 2: Taking to the air - Focusing on insects and their conquest of flight
Ep 3: The Silk Spinners - On invertebrates that make use of silk, including insects but focusing mostly on spiders
Ep 4: Intimate Relations - On symbiotic, parasitic and commensal relationships between various invertebrate species and between invertebrates and plants.
Ep 5: Supersocieties - On insects that form colonies and supercolonies - bees, wasps, ants, termites.

Highlights include the giant centipedes that hunt for bats by catching them in mid-air, 6-foot long giant earthworms in Australia that make so much noise burrowing underground that the earth gurgles beneath your feet, parasitic wasps that inject their eggs into the bodies of caterpillars which proceed to hatch and eat their hosts alive, one species even allowing the caterpillar to pupate only to kill it in the chrysalis and emerge as a fully-formed wasp at the end as if by some act of devilish magic. There's a beautiful sequence taken in Waitomo, New Zealand where the ceiling of a dark cave twinkles with a constellation of blue fairy lights, like stars in the Milky Way. Only on closer inspection do you see that they are the larvae of fungus gnats. There's also a segment on spiders which work in concert (in thousands) to construct 60 foot high webs that form a veritable silken wall across the jungle canopy, trapping insects, birds and well-nigh anything else that fly into them.

The series was shot in 1.78:1 high definition widescreen and is presented as such on DVD (enhanced for widescreen TV). Picture quality is breathtaking. Sound is in 2.0 Stereo with surprisingly good bass extension, notably in the accompanying music. The DVD includes a half-hour long interview with producer Mike Salisbury on the making of the series but unfortunately none with Sir David. It also comes with a separate recording of the complete score by Ben Salisbury and David Poore in 2.0 Stereo, playable separately with 25 individual cueing tracks.

Breathtaking as all this is, it is also a little sad to realise that with this series, David Attenborough has apparently precluded any separate ""Life of Insects"" series to add to his other ""Life Of..."" documentaries. Alas, so much to do in so little time. Perhaps we should just count our blessings and be thankful that Sir David has shared so much of his life with us. He has brought home to millions around the world the joy and passion he holds towards all living things on our singularly beautiful living planet. I personally know of many people whose love for the life sciences were sparked by exposure to his inspiring documentaries and books. You could probably go to any corner of the world and be able to find life scientists who hold him in the highest regard and the deepest affection. To think that he is now into his eighties and still hard at work (he reached 80 earlier this month - May 8). A truly remarkable man. He has just premiered his new 2-part documentary on climate change and its effects on wildlife (BBC UK). And he is currently working on the forthcoming ""Life of Reptiles"". For those interested in learning more about the various creatures featured here, this series comes with Attenborough's beautifully illustrated hardcover book, published by the BBC in the UK and by Princeton in the US.",1149033600,200,4444,4.985175202156334
2512347,5,B000EBD9W6,"This is certainly the best and most exciting movie on invertebrates  (and indeed life on Earth) with stunning shots, details on the biology of many species and macrophotography which even I as a specialist haven't seen, and I could not see with my usual equipment. Indeed, almost any sequence has its unprecedented merit from an esthetical point of view, as well as from a scientific.

Rarely in my live, I would be watching movies during my precious business hours. It makes you addicted to invertebrates and their private lives.",1148860800,61,530,4.943820224719101

On the other hand his best friend (six years old) left the room ten minutes into the program to practice his piano playing.  It is unquestionably a wonderful example of Sir David's ability to introduce us to an unseen and mostly unknown world.  If you like spiders and centipedes, the butterflies can be a little boring.  But when they come on your wife can open her eyes, and you can grab a beer.  All in all a great two or three evenings of family viewing.",1422144000,,593,4.288288288288288

2512505,5,B000EBD9W6,"My wife and I enjoyed this series far more than other Attenborough nature series.  The insects rule!  Such diversity, such strangely uniform instincts and societies.  Beside the fact that Attenborough knows his little friends so well, one cannot escape the fact that survival of the fittest is really a term that means survival of the fittest-in-the-given ecosystem.  And insects have lived on the edge for so many millions of years, and no doubt will be here long after we humans are gone.",1398038400,,490,4.939024390243903

The shows have brilliant photography and science presented in a way that non-mensa people can understand (Mensa folk are too busy checking out the photographic details and looking for Inaccuracies).  The series is basically about the invertebrates.  How they developed, how they live,  etc.  My only complaint is that it appears to only be available on SD.",1397779200,,473,5.157894736842105

David's voice is great so that drew the kid's attention, and the fact that he is there and present at the shoot with the bugs (for most of it; you cannot see him in every single frame) was impressive to the students.  They really enjoyed it and all of them said they would watch it again.  The information, while not watered down at all, was easily understood and I could probably show it to 6th graders as well with great interest.",1397433600,,534,4.363636363636363

Attenborough has a knack for combining interesting facts with beautiful cinematography. I wasn't sure I would enjoy this movie because it focuses on bugs and insects, which creep me out a little.

2512579,5,B000EBD9W6,"""Life in the undergrowth"" is a five-part BBC series about insects, spiders, snails and other bugs. New recording technology makes the critters come to life in ways we haven't seen before. The whole extravaganza is hosted, as it should be, by David Attenborough. Full disclosure: I haven't seen the entire series, only the official sneak peaks posted by BBC Nature at Youtube. I'm scared stiff already! ""This series will cure your arachnophobia"" according to the promotion material. I can assure you that it didn't work on my humble self...

The bizarre 17-year life cycle of cicadas, literal wars between ants and termites, carnivorous larvae using silk threads to catch their prey, gall wasps, giant Asian honeybees, ants that live in the tidal zone (!) of a mangrove swamp...that's just some of the action in the undergrowth. My favourite are the blue wing butterflies, the larvae of which live inside ant nests for protection. However, a parasitic wasp has the ability to locate the hidden larvae inside the nests, trick the ants into attacking each other, and then lay its eggs inside the poor larva anyway! Another favourite of mine are the termites, the mounds of which are really gigantic thermostats?!

As David Attenborough points out, insects and other ""bugs"" would hardly notice our disappearance, but we would surely notice theirs - and the ecological disaster that would follow. As somebody pointed out long ago: God loves beetles. If you have the same strange appetite, ""Life in the Undergrowth"" will give you a real treat. Personally, I'm even more scared of creeping, crawling, flying things after seeing this, than I was before.

I'm bugging out, LOL.",1375056000,,1668,5.058181818181819

The cinematography is breathtaking and Mr. Attenborough's narration throughout the entire 6 hour video places you in some form of hypnotic trance.  I don't think there will ever be another documentary focused solely on insects as thorough and as breathtakingly beautiful as BBC's Life in the Undergrowth.  BRAVO!!,1340841600,,515,4.576086956521739

2512676,5,B000EBD9W6,"As a huge fan of Sir David Attenborough, I have watched enough nature documentaries to identify various types of seals or whales or other often-featured animals in the Attenborough archive.  But this series focuses on many surprisingly interesting and mesmerizing creatures not previously presented in BBC Earth projects.  I've always been a bit afraid of bugs - especially the crawly kind - so it was with great reservation that I started watching this series.  And wow, am I glad I did!  Attenborough is at the top of his game as always, narrating the various intricate characteristics of these tiny creatures to the audience; the writing and production are also top-notch, making the series both educational and awe-inspiring.  Among all the ""Life"" series, this has unpredictably become one of my favorites.  If you want to take a break from penguins in Antarctica or cats in the jungle (even if you don't think you would ever enjoy 5 hours on bugs), give this a try!",1324944000,2,970,4.920245398773006

2512710,5,B000EBD9W6,"I first became aware of Sir David Attenborough's nature productions with his ""Life on Earth"" series in the 1980's. It remains one of my fondest memories of youth! However, when I tried to purchase it, I found  that it is not available on DVD in full and in region one. This is a tragedy and hopefully will be corrected SOON!
  So, as a replacement, I tried this set. I was not disappointed. It is marvelous to be able to see these fascinating creatures clearly and up-close. I especially appreciate this set as it presents creatures we would probably never see, living as many of them do, mostly underground or being too tiny to be noticeable.
  Sir David is just as I remember him (albeit with more grey hairs): charming, witty, eloquent, warm and engaging. I think his personality alone would be enough to turn non-nature enthusiasts into great fans. In fact, I frequently was reduced to tears of joy observing his tremendous love of nature and of life in general. If only all people harboured a similar feeling of unity with all creation, what a world this could be!

Quite frankly, I wasn't too excited about watching a show about bugs, but through this show gained a much better appreciation of the insect world.  Unfortunately, the makers of this documentary couldn't just stick with facts.  Instead of just presenting facts they littered the show with the THEORY of evolution, dismissed God's wonderful creation....It definitly had a pro-evolution, anti-God agenda.  One has to be incredibly blind to look at creation (bugs, animals, plants, the human body, the cosmos, et.,) and not see God's handiwork in all of it....the fact that He alone created it all, and He alone sustains it.  By the way, there is absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever of evolution..never has been, and never will be....don't buy into the lie.",1309046400,19,820,5.229007633587786

D.A. avoids this trap by chosing five major topics: adaptation from water to land, flight, silk spinning, relations between species, and supersocieties. The examples within each of these topics are arranged to tell a fascinating story of development.
The overall effect, in both the DVD series of five programs and
the companion book of five chapters, is that you become aware of an interrelated system of mind-boggling complexity.",1299715200,,563,5.337078651685394

I am ready to put it at the top of my Attenborough collection.
I have them all, and have seen and re-seen all of them many, many times.

But good photography (don't get me wrong - the photography of this DVD is better than excellent) does not make an excellent wildlife documentary. It is always the ""teleplay"" or the subject matter, and perhaps even more importantly, the way in which the episodes are ordered. This one is simply perfect. You can't edit one word out, or re-sequence something.

Watch all of them in order, until you are blown away by the mutinies of the insect world...

While hiking in the woods or mowing your lawn, if you saw insects scurrying about and thought they were insignificant automata, just waiting to be eaten by some birds or other more relevant creatures, think again. Remember the first wildlife documentary you saw about the crocodile taking the wildebeest and the cheetah caring for her young. This is the true equivalent to that... about the insect world. They live so much more a complex life than you ever imagined.

The camera work is spectacular. The technical aspects of the macro photography in itself is enough reason to watch this, even if you don't care about biology.",1289174400,2,814,4.891304347826087

2512772,5,B000EBD9W6,"This is the 8th entry in the David Attenborough Life series following The Life of Mammals. The groundbreaking first series Life on Earth was based on evolution and started with bacteria making its way up to modern humans over the course of 13 episodes. The Living Planet was 12 episodes long and dealt mainly with adaptation over a wide range of environments that also incorporated more Earth science along with the life science in terms of geology and environments. The Trials of Life was 12 episodes long and all about animal behaviour. Life in the freezer was 6 episodes long and specialized on the Antarctic. The Private life of Plants was another 6 episode series and focused entirely on botany. The Life of Birds was 10 episodes long and is one of the best documentaries about birds ever made. The Life of Mammals was 10 episodes long and featured some ingenious ways of filming mammals in ways never seen before.

With Life in the Freezer and The Private Life of Plants Attenborough made a new move to specialize instead of following the 12-13 episode discipline that started with Clark's Civilisations and Bronowski's The Ascent of Man and birthed other great series like Sagan's Cosmos, Attenborough now decides to detach from the shorter episode format of Freezer and Plants (an such as was in previous non-life series such as The Tribal Eye, The First Eden and Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives) and goes for a higher number of 10 instead of 6 instalments on another expert theme. Attenborough concentrates on part of the animal kingdom, the insects, for 5 episodes, and the result is some of the best micro-filming to date but also some of the scariest.

Major themes include how the insects evolved on land from the sea, how they adapted to flight, learned to spin silk, mating rituals and colonies.

I must admit, this was not easiest to sit through, especially the silk spinners which has jumping spiders so for lots of people out there this could be behind the couch peeking out viewing. The final episode, supersocieties, has Attenborough describing ant interactions in unprecedented depth. This is probably the best ant filming you will ever see. The society is truly astonishing and how they interact is mind-blowing.",1244419200,,2230,4.894179894179894

My two year old is really into bugs and insects so I thought this would be valuable for him, but my husband and I have really been enjoying it and watch it even after our son goes to bed.  The camera-work is amazing and you just don't get tired of watching the beauty.  I don't think there are any other movies out there which use such tiny cameras so you get such a deep look at these creatures.  Plus who knew there were so many amazing insects with social systems, amazing hunting techniques and interesting mating rituals.  Some of these things are right out of a sci-fi movie...but they're real! :) Attenborough is wonderful to listen too and his presence gives you perspective of the size of some of these creatures.  Overall, very highly recommended.",1239408000,,896,4.53416149068323

2512800,5,B000EBD9W6,"If you like the Planet Earth series then I would definitely recommend checking this out.  It is part of David Attenborough's life series and it is all about insects.  I actually found this to be more interesting than Planet Earth because of the alien nature of insects.  These bugs look amazing and have so much detail up close, it will open up a whole new world to you.",1233878400,,370,4.411764705882353

The images in this production are so clear and close you feel like you are down on the ground with the creatures themselves. Not only is the videography excellent, but the information about each insect is informative and entertaining. This program helps me and my kids understand that we share this earth with a myriad of other beings and that we have a responsibility to make sure their chances of success are not ruined by our selfish behavior with our earth's resources. David Attenborough is an excellent host, he guides you through the program like a wise and gentle grandfather. He is genuinely delighted with these amazing stories and wants to share them with you.  We also recommend the other videos in this series, Life of Birds, Life in Cold Blood, and Life of Mammals.",1231286400,,889,4.735483870967742
2512803,5,B000EBD9W6,"Some people may not find insects all that majestic, but I usually find them to be vastly interesting creatures, as long as they're not crawling all over me!  Despite my lack of interest in physically going to look at bugs on location, I am glad the BBC saw fit to bring the bugs onto my TV screen so I can view them there.

As is to be expected from a BBC production featuring Attenborough there is some top quality footage.  Naturally they can't document all insects, but they give is a great variety across the five episodes between the two DVD's.  This is a great introductory piece to the insect world if you are interested in using it for a biology class or something along those lines.  They cover insects like moths, butterflies, spiders, aphids, centipedes, millipedes, ants and bees.  Episodes touch upon aspects of how insects evolved and how they adapted to their specific locations in the world.  They also go into detail about the insect's specific environment as well as how some insects develop symbiotic relationships with other insect species or the trees in which some make their homes.

As Attenborough points out, the only reason we are able to get some of this amazing footage is because prior to this we didn't have the micro cameras necessary to really capture some of these tiny insects in their environment.  ""Life in the Undergrowth"" brings us into the burrows of ants and termites so we can see what goes on below ground.  We also get an inside look on how bees interact with each other within a hive.  The footage is truly breathtaking and we can view spiders making incredible webs in just a couple of minutes with the camera sped up.  One of the most impressive footage is the night camera footage of a giant centipede hunting for bats at the top of a cavern.  Truly an intimidating insect!

If you are looking for a wonderful introduction to the insect world then this is a superb place to start.  While it may not cover the precise insects you find in your back yard, it will definitely touch upon some species variant of some kind.  The footage is absolutely amazing and I learned a lot about the different insects shown here, since I am just starting to introduce myself to this kind of material.  Honestly, I don't think you even have to be a major insect enthusiast to truly find this documentary interesting.  Attenborough's narration makes this series very fun to watch providing wonderful anecdotes amidst the information he's trying to present to the viewer.  A must watch in my opinion.",1231200000,3,2527,4.676470588235294

Even I, with my acute arachnophobia, watch enthralled.  As with most of DA's documentaries, it fills me with wonder and delight every time.  I like it even better than ""Planet Earth"" because taking on a smaller subject (insects rather than all animals over the whole planet) allows for greater depth.",1228176000,,431,4.863013698630137
2512805,5,B000EBD9W6,"True to the style of all of his other ""Life"" series, Attenborough opens a world that is completely unseen by the higher mammals. He does it beautifully. Even though my husband & I are nature fanatics, some of these creatures had escaped our radar until highlighted by Attenborough; many filmed sequences had us watching with mouths agape in amazement, and were partnered with an exceptional score worth listening to by itself (and is included on the DVD in the special features section). I personally feel that the presence of Attenborough in the film served to impress the sense of scale against these creatures, or in the case of the giant earthworm, to give you the feeling of ""being there."" If more of this programming wormed its way into our school systems, there would be a more ""planet aware"" generation. This series humbled this human.",1223596800,3,843,4.861111111111111

For instance, the third episode is on silk spinners, but it doesn't even mention the silk moths because it has so much to say about cave-dwelling silk spinning fluorescent predatory invertebrates and unusual spiders that hunt in highly specialized ways or even poach prey from other spiders.

This is an incredibly beautiful DVD, very worth watching several times! The music is sublime and the images are crisp and clear. It reminds me a little bit of ""Microcosmos"".

Take heed of Mr Attenbourough's wise and clear words: If humans would dissapear from the face of the earth, the world would go on quite unchanged, but if the insects should dissapear, whole ecosystems would collapse and life as we know it would succumb.!

Truly the gold standard of natural history broadcasting.",1169078400,3,399,5.203125
2512936,5,B000EBD9W6,"This will be brief, as the previous reviewer did such a wonderful job of describing the contents.  Suffice to say, as a teacher struggling to teach life science in an engaging way to sixth graders for the first time, this series was a godsend.  All of us, myself included, were immediately drawn into this brilliantly filmed, delightfully narrated, and fact-filled journey into the world of tiny invertebrates.  This DVD is highly recommended for students of all ages.  Thank you Sir Attenborough.",1168905600,5,497,5.098765432098766
2512947,5,B000EBD9W6,This documentary is one of the finest I have ever seen.  The closeup photography of the insects is beautiful and of the highest quality.  David Attenborough gives a compelling and extremely informative narrative.  The five episodes are structured so that we learn about the insects from the earliest ones to leave the ocean all the way up to the most complex societies of bees and ants.  I learned many fascinating and mind blowing facts about insect behavior.  It's a MUST SEE!,1168473600,3,478,4.851851851851852
2512948,5,B000EBD9W6,"We enjoyed this DVD immensely.  If you liked the Blue Planet, Life of Mammals series you will also enjoy this.  The DVD exlplores the complex and entertaining lives of the small creatures that inhabit the world around us that we are oblivious to.",1168300800,2,246,4.6976744186046515
2512949,5,B000EBD9W6,"The photography is great. We love the close-ups, and wonder what we are missing just by walking instead of lying on the ground like Sir Attenbourgh. My son loves to watch this DVD. However, there was only so much we could take of the parasitic wasps, and we got grossed out. But if you don't watch hours of this, and don't watch while eating, it's fantastic.",1168300800,,358,4.4393939393939394
2512950,5,B000EBD9W6,"It was a long time coming.  My all-time personal favorite documentary series, ""The Blue Planet,"" has finally been toppled from its throne as King of Nature Films.  From the second ""Life in the Undergrowth"" opens, you'll sit absolutely mesmerized as a gorgeous and wonderfully alien world unfolds before you.

From a ridiculously beautiful shot of a snail's eye to dragonflies filmed in super slow-motion; from bizarre bioluminsecent cave-dwelling grubs to a brutal war waged between a phalanx of African ants and their termite conquests, the five episodes span the history of land-dwelling invertebrates on Earth, each dragging you deeper and deeper into the bizarre microcosm living in the leaf litter in your backyard.

""Life in the Undergrowth"" is simply beautiful.  There's no other way to phrase it.  A film revolving around the tiny multi-legged horrors that creep about largely unseen has no right to be this overwhelmingly pretty, but it is.  I sat, jaw agape, through the entire 5 hours on my initial viewing, and have since rewatched the DVDs perhaps 15 times since my purchase.

It's perhaps not as long as I would have liked, nor is the coverage exhaustively comprehensive, but whatever this series may lack in terms of breadth, it more than compensates for with sheer eye-candy.

Buy it, watch it, love it.  You will be transfixed.",1168041600,15,1344,5.068181818181818
2512951,5,B000EBD9W6,"Having seen one clip of this series on YouTube (about the giant bat-eating centipedes), and reading all the reviews I decided to buy the set (along with Blue Planet, which I haven't had a chance to look at yet). I will confess that I knew OF David Attenborough, but by no means was I familiar with his work. All I can really say is that this set is MAGNIFICENT. It really blew my expectations away. The camera-work, Sir Attenborough's insights, the music - it all comes together to provide 5 episodes of pure magic. I showed a few episodes to my mother (and she has no interest in documentaries, especially nature ones - her favourite movies either star John Travolta or Samuel L. Jackson) and she was hooked. She was absolutely captured by it all. She was laughing at points, upset at others and even cringing in fear at a few (ie. the spiders that attack with group behaviour). Anyway, this is a set of DVDs that I will cherish forever, show my friends, show my family, and watch it repeatedly myself. I highly recommend it to anyone - you just can't go wrong!",1165708800,,1062,4.479381443298969
2512952,5,B000EBD9W6,"My only complaint is that it's only two DVD's! This is by far one of the best narrated documentaries I've seen on the tiny universe, ever. Better than ""Microcosmos"", ""Invisible World"", or any of the other productions, David Attenborough really shines as our tour guide in a world full of violence, sex, life, and death! The cinematography is very  impressive, and lives of the alien creatures beneath our feet unfolds like a movie you cannot turn off!",1164931200,4,451,4.857142857142857
2512953,5,B000EBD9W6,"Just when you thought age was finally catching up on Sir David, he proves us wrong again. With Life in the Undergrowth, he just proves how much of energy he still has in him, which we sure can aspire to have!

Life in the Undergrowth is a superlative documentary, touching on the invertebrates in a way which we might not have imagined. The photography is almost unbelievable, the narration is awesome and the overall presentation if the DVD is excellent. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys anything to do with the natural world.

I don't get creeped easily when it comes to animals and bugs, but that centipede sure got to me! Spent a couple of nights not sleeping and watching under the doors and window gaps!",1163376000,4,717,4.507692307692308
2512954,5,B000EBD9W6,"This dvd is wonderful and a great way to show the young what those little creatures they find so fascinating actually look like. Two under five grandkids and at least one parent thoroughly enjoy this presentation and it makes their outdoor sessions even more interesting and exciting.

The filming and narration are second to none.",1163030400,3,331,5.0181818181818185
2512955,5,B000EBD9W6,"Life in the Undergrowth continues David Attenborough's remarkable ""life of"" series. And with every one of his documentaries, I learn about some new animals, or behavior that I'd never heard of before. In that regard, ""Life in the Undergrowth"" takes the cake. The reason for that is that there are virtually no in-depth, comprehensive, large documentaries focused primarily on invertebrates.

Usually, when I would come across a documentary about insects or what-have-you, they wouldn't film them close-up in nature, they would film scientists talking about the creatures in a laboratory looking at them through a microscope. This series is completely the opposite!

The photography is spectacular; it's so close to the subjects that I forget that they're only  of an inch long. And it's crystal clear; the quality of this DVD is superb.

And of course David Attenborough's commentary is completely engaging and informative. He's hardly looking his age; his enthusiasm hasn't waned a bit. So much work went into the narration of this program, which the interview with producer Mike Salisbury really showcases. They had to see a lot of biologists in the field to find all these stories that are brought to life in the series. Many of these sequences are completely new behavior and have never been filmed before!

The music in this documentary is included as a listen-only option on the second disc for good reason. It's fantastic, fits all the programs perfectly, and is very enjoyable to listen to on its own.

So, all in all, this is another cracking title in the ""life of"" series. Highly recommended!",1158278400,2,1602,5.072243346007604
2512956,5,B000EBD9W6,"Striking visually, breathtaking footages of the smallest and rarest arthropods, also highly informative and scientifically acurate. The best documentary about the small articulated and segmented critters to date and probably for a long time!",1157932800,,241,6.117647058823529
2512976,5,B000EBD9W6,"David Attenborough is probably the best around when it comes to natural history programs. His other series have always been outstanding whether they deal with birds, mammals, sea creatures, penguins or anything else. Particularly great was his LIFE ON EARTH series. This series is in the same vein of greatness.

Although it is mostly about insects, it is cot completely about insects. The theme is invertebrate life on the land. Due to sheer numbers, that reduces to mostly being about insects but there are some nice asides.

The series is divided into five programs, each with its own theme.

The first deals with the colonization of the land. This program has the most variety in terms of differing types of creatures.

The second deals with the development of flight and looks at the ways insects fly.

The third deals with the making of silk. While this is primarily the domain of spiders, other insects make this remarkable material as well.

The fourth looks at strange relationships between the ""bugs"" and other bugs or other life. Parasites and symbionts are the order of the day here.

The final show examines the great hive cultures of wasps, bees, ants and termites.

The quality of the ideography is outstanding throughout. Recent advances in lenses and electronics make possible this new view of the small scale world. As with all of Attenborough's work, this is a masterpiece.",1157760000,16,1392,4.944206008583691
2512977,4,B000EBD9W6,"The photography was to the point of being almost unbelieveable compared to other nature videos I have seen.  The new lenses,  cameras, and photographic techniques allow a view of nature never before available and it was fascinating. So often night scenes are dark and difficult to make out but not the case with the magnificant photography in this series.

My disappointment came with two different segments. The one on butterflies and moths left out the huge colorful Saturnid moths showing only the day flying moths which are quite small compared to the many large Saturnids. Most people have never seen these huge moths and are amazed to find out that they exist in their own back yard but are only active at night.  The caterpillars of these large moths are also quite spectacular but were not shown.

The other disappointment came with the segment on the 17 year Cicadas. The filming was done here in the Cincinnati area but we were given no mention and there was no mention of the considerable damage these insects do to trees.  The female has a knife like ovipositor and cuts long slits in the bottom of younger branches to lay her eggs. This causes the death of some young trees and in many cases causes the branches to die on other trees in which the eggs are laid. I had a young bradford pear that took two years to recover from the cicada damage. Also nothing was shown of the larval cicadas dropping from the branches after they had hatched and burrowing into the ground and disappearing for the next 17 years.

I realize they couldn't cover everything but it makes me wonder what other interesing material was left out of other segments.

I hope that the BBC revisits this series with more material on the varied and most interesting life of insects.

I am very glad the series was produced and so glad if is available on DVD and I recommend it highly even with the short comings that I preceive.",1156377600,12,1909,4.607669616519174
2512978,5,B000EBD9W6,"I'm a biology major at Wesleyan University, and I have never, EVER seen a more fair, true and beautifully detailed representation of insect life.

2512982,5,B000EBD9W6,"This series was yet another of David Attenborough's greatest achievements. The camera work in this series is truly out of this world. It rivals the already incredible footage that was found in ""The Life of Birds"" due to the micro scale on which everything occurs. I am personally a nature lover, yet was not very familiar with the smallest critters since most documentaries of years past focus on larger animals. The intricacies of each insect species will blow your mind if you start thinking about it. The portions focusing on the symbiotic relationships was the best, in my opinion. Seeing how certain bugs can trick other species into raising their young is pretty remarkable.

As far as evolution goes, I have always loved the way David Attenborough and his crew actually explain the reasons behind each adaptation. Rather than saying, for example, ""This bug can glow at night,"" he would explain, ""This bug developed the ability to glow at night, which allows possible mates to see it better and thus increase the chances for survival."" It kind of surprises me to see people rating this series 1-star simply because it talks about evolution. We are now long past debating evolution, so let's enjoy exploring its ins and outs through some great documentary filmmaking!",1152489600,4,1272,4.971830985915493
