8670390,4,B00M58FRIA,"This is a well-done indie film with high production value that explores the mentality of loyalty to the streets and loyalty to the family. It is not a traditional urban flick - with this film there is a message and a lesson to be learned.

There is some VERY solid acting in this film and the original music elevates this film into another category.

My only criticism of this film, which is more of a personal preference, is since the film takes place over years, I wish they would've aged the actors instead of using new actors as their ages progressed. That being said, all actors put in a solid performance. I especially enjoyed the performances of Carter Redwood and Edwin Lee Gibson.

You can't go wrong with a film that has a thought-provoking story line, great acting, great music and high production value. Support this very good independent film.",1441584000,3,856,4.693333333333333
8670391,5,B00M58FRIA,I give this a five star because it's an independent film that gave us a story of a father who was driving off of morals and principles. Great job SPOTLITE ENTERTAINMENT,1440720000,,168,4.451612903225806
8670392,5,B00M58FRIA,"A powerful hood film that explores an incarcerated father's raw honesty about the lessons in life with his two sons. Bringing to the forefront the relationship between the two brothers & why there's honor in brotherhood. The setting of the movie is realistic & the message is very well executed. It makes you ask questions about how far you're willing to extend your loyalty to family, friends & the code of the street. Things that you never think about until certain circumstances force you to do so. A must see - REAL TALK !",1428278400,5,526,4.6063829787234045
