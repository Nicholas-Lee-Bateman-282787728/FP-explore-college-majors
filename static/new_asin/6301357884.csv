7811219,5,6301357884,"shot on location in beautiful Waco Texas, this is the best buddy-cop movie to ever come out of Waco Texas... in 1989.

dramatizing the well-documented diamond-smuggling epidemic of central Texas, this movie features action, sexual tension, and the ALICO building, among other things.",1342828800,,283,5.5813953488372094
7811220,4,6301357884,"I wish I could get this movie on a DVD. It's shot in and around Waco, Texas. It's not exactly a hit movie but it is very campy and funny.",1320624000,,137,3.6
7811221,5,6301357884,"There are not a lot of big Hollywood stars in this movie, maybe a few familiar faces, but what it lacks in famous names, it makes up for with stunts, stunts, awesome characters, and bigger stunts. I think they shot it on location in Stuntville. Character actor Ross Hagan plays one of the best bad guys of all time (Mr. Drago) and delivers some fantastic lines. When asked, by his female hostage, what he does for a living, Mr. Drago replies, ""I put b*****es in the ground!"", while delivering a backhanded slap. One of many. But really it's all about the stunts. This film is tailor-made to be enjoyed by a room full of dudes. The sound quality is a bit lacking, but does not take away from the enjoyment of the picture.",1319673600,,720,4.421052631578948
7811222,4,6301357884,"This little known 1989 Independent film was Filmed on Location in and around Waco Texas, I was an extra in one of the street scenes, many of us from Waco were used in the film in these non speaking roles, if you like a real action film this one has you covered, not the best acting around, but a fast paced action flick that most people into these films will enjoy.",1213056000,,365,4.154929577464789
