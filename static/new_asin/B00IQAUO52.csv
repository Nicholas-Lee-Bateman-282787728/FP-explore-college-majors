6286087,2,B00IQAUO52,"Horrible film. Just horrible.  You have to search to find that Dean Cain is in this film,even though his cute smiling face is on the cover.  Wonder what he paid to get his name hidden from the list of actors here.  But I do see that on IMDB.COM you see Mr Cain listed front and center.",1408838400,,285,4.053571428571429

6286090,1,B00IQAUO52,"I don""t like to rate movies that can""t keep my interest! So that""s it! I just checked it out to see what it was about......booze......how to approach chicks.....or something like that! Half way through, I wanted to watch something else, but I kept watching. I don""t wanna see it again!",1404691200,2,285,4.72
6286091,1,B00IQAUO52,I couldn't watch this movie all the way through because it was so stupid. The actors just didn't grab the plot and was so boring I gave it up after a little while.,1403049600,,163,3.9696969696969697
6286092,1,B00IQAUO52,Could not get through the first 15 minutes. Was looking for something silly to watch but this was not it.,1402358400,,105,4.3

6286118,2,B00IQAUO52,This is just about as lousy and poorly written and acted movie as there ever been one; fast forwarding did not make it better - just faster to go away!,1430265600,,151,4.066666666666666
6286119,1,B00IQAUO52,"Okay, I admit I chose to watch this movie solely because I enjoy Dean Cane and his Mr Everyman persona. I have enjoyed his work in the past, (not counting the Saturday Movie of the week on the SciFi Channel.).  You know how it is... It's Dean Cane, not Jack Nicholson. You do know what your getting before you head down the rabbit hole.

Well oopsie daisy.  Although Cane is prominently featured on the Video poster for the movie. His performance is basically a walkon, and in my opinion he just phoned the performance in.

The premise for the tale had great potential but fell woefully short on quality of writing and characters as nuanced as a brick to the face.

Is it just me, or am I seeing a trend develop with the level of quality offered with the Prime membership.  It is beginning to appear that quality options are going to require additional monetary expendatures. I will have to rethink this membership benefit package.",1427414400,11,931,4.578313253012048

6286122,3,B00IQAUO52,"Not a bad movie but a bad picture to advertise it.
The movie is actually a little funny.",1419465600,,88,3.9444444444444446
8644620,2,B00IQAUO52,"This film reminded me of the Brasilian ""model"" promoting object rape con dumbs on ""Facebook"".  That widespread practice has had the advantage of reducing the previous tendency to grotesque overpopulation in Brasil but that has been mostly a side effect of turning off hetero relationships along with the widespread criminal corruption of all branches of goofermint since the Lula administration.  The ""Man Camp"" similarly reminded me of the current homosexual dominance ritual ""Olympics"" currently being slopperated in Rio de Janeiro with drunk and disorderly ""athletes"" pretending to have been assaulted by locals to temporarily cover for their filmed ""athletic"" destruction of private property.  But other than reminders of what Brasil has become in recent years, there was nothing to the script.",1471651200,,798,5.578512396694215

8644624,3,B00IQAUO52,"This move is OK, but it doesn't know what it wants to be.  It starts off wanting to be something silly with the whole man camp pranks and turns into a chick flick.",1455840000,,163,3.9393939393939394
