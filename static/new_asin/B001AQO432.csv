8278637,5,B001AQO432,The time is now for the remaining seasons of Silver Spoons to be released.  The biggest profit for the DVD's will be from people who grew up with the show and now have children entering the same age group.  Let's hope whoever is in charge doesn't miss the boat on this one.,1285632000,12,273,4.230769230769231
8278638,5,B001AQO432,Come ON Sony!  Do a box set of this series and get the other seasons released already!  There are some gems in seasons 2-5 that I've only seen once!  I want to let my son see all of these while he is still young enough to enjoy them too!  I just adore this cast in their roles and want this family program in my house!  Great stuff for we 80s kids!,1285459200,8,348,3.8450704225352115
8278639,5,B001AQO432,"I have been waiting and waiting for the second season to come out.  Family ties is out and Golden Girls and Little House on the Prairie are also out, so why is it taking so long for Silver Spoons.  I have the first season already and my kids love it.",1270598400,9,250,3.98
8278640,5,B001AQO432,"As another reviewer noted, this is the season when Franklin Seales debuts as the one of a kind, hilarious Dexter Stuffins. I believe Alphonso Ribeiro too joins the cast as Alphonso Spears later in the season, but he may not debut 'til season 3. The entire five seasons are packed with guests stars, such as Pearl Bailey (3rd season?), Ray Walston (5th season?)and my favorite, Billie Bird (5th season?)! The characters, their interactions with one another and the issues they face become more complex as the series progresses. The show grows with 'Ricky', which in my opinion is absolutely awesome. The show never really stalls because of this. It never really gets stuck in a time-capsule if you will, or 'jumps the shark'. Because the series grows as it does, looking back, I can't help but think that so much could have been written in, new angles and situations that never really were explored, could have been tapped. It's a shame that the show only lasted five seasons. I just hope now, Sony will release seasons 2-5 so we fans of the show aren't relegated to watching and passing around old copies taped way back when the show aired.

Please Sony, save us from our grainy worn out tapes :)",1264291200,12,1196,4.695238095238095
8278641,5,B001AQO432,"Okay Sony, we see that your releasing some of your other stalled series (The Patridge Family, The Nanny) but this is another one you really need to start releasing again! I love this show, its one of the best sitcoms of the 80s. I would definetly buy the second season the day that it came out :)",1231977600,21,296,4.2105263157894735
8278642,5,B001AQO432,"I can hardly wait till they bring the 1983-84 Season of SILVER SPOONS out on DVD, since SILVER SPOONS 2nd Season is even better than it's 1st Season and I've been waiting for SILVER SPOONS to be released for nearly 2 years now, since SILVER SPOONS has already been out on DVD since the Summer of 2007.

This is also the season when Dexter Stuffins(Franklin Seales)joins the cast & crew of this show and replaces Edward's attorney Leonard Rollins(Leonard Lightfoot)and when Ricky's snotty arrogant troublemaking pal Derrick Taylor(Jason Bateman) departs the show in the Winter of 1984 when Derrick's parents split up since Jason Bateman left SILVER SPOONS to start his own show as the smooth-talking Matthew on the short-lived sitcom IT'S YOUR MOVE which debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1984, but had fizzled after only 6 months, due to poor ratings which resulted in its cancellation in the Winter of 1985.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""BE THERE"" and when I used to watch SILVER SPOONS at 8:30 PM every Saturday night right after DIFFERENT STROKES at 8PM, since SILVER SPOONS and DIFFERENT STROKES were both part of NBC's Saturday night line-up back then, just like MAMA'S FAMILY was.",1228089600,15,1233,4.784037558685446
