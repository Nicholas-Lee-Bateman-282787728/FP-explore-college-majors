8487025,1,B005UP4Z0G,"It is difficult to say what audience this video is intended for;  but based on the other reviews, those who might appreciate this amateur hodgepodge of semi-porn erotica do indeed exist.  Perhaps if you were a closeted teen in the 50s or 60s, you might find this ""story"" (such as it is) reminiscent of those ""good ol' days.""  But for the rest of us, this is a low-budget, laughably cheesy, poorly made mess.  Beware.",1469750400,,416,4.581081081081081

I have never been so disappointed in Amazon...this pathetic junk is so bad in picture quality, sound, color, acting, dialog...Im angry that Amazon has the nerve to take money from people for this trash.",1338768000,2,257,4.863636363636363
8487027,4,B005UP4Z0G,This was as close as I want to get to hard core porn. The music was great and so was the nude scenes. I usually don't go into movies like this one but this one was just a little bit different. This is why I gave it four stars. I have returned movies in the past because of the porn content. Not quite XXX but close. It is a keeper and I will watch it over and over.,1330819200,3,365,3.6923076923076925
8487028,4,B005UP4Z0G,"This film was produced originally  in 1995 before there was HD digital or any of the new technological advances we now enjoy. But I really loved the eroticism and romance that permeated through this story. Two men dancing naked locked in a lustful embrace is what I was looking for and it was there in full splendor. The humor made me laugh and the different eras the film traveled through made me smile. The whole film is a fantasy so the narrative is a bit loose and the sound varies, but I was charmed.",1327708800,4,505,4.372340425531915
8487029,1,B005UP4Z0G,"Thumbs down for sure! An awfully dreadful film this is. I am seriously disturbed that anybody figured this rubbish was good enough to be produced. It needs to be pulled from the shelves immediately to prevent anybody else from wasting sixty minutes of their life trying to make sense of this trash. This film was a mixed up mess of nonsense with no natural flow. The transister radio narration at the beginning was my first warning that this was going to be horrible. When a film begins with a narrator whose intention is to lay the grounds for what the movie is about, it is a sign that the writer even knew himslef he couldn't portray the story by picture and acting alone. It did not get better. This just kept going down hill from the minute I pressed play. It was so excruciating to watch that I nearly slit my wrists to end it all. I came close to shooting myself in the foot for purchasing this crap. As you can tell by this review I am severely disappointed with this fizzy picture. There is Bad acting. Amateur dialog. Botched sound. Ridiculous script. Busted and blurry camera work and a story line that was hacked up so badly that it appeared to be parts from different B movies that were picked up off the floor of the editing room and pieced together with yellowed sticky tape. Junk, Junk, Junk. A meaningless story that started and finish with the same character as an attempt to call it a cohesive full length feature. Rubbish! This was not what I expected at all and it makes Sarah Palin's reality show seem like Osar material. Yes, it is that bad. Unfortunately I had to give it one star so I could waste another ten minutes of my life to warn everybody NOT to buy this garbage. I am embarrassed that I viewed this movie and now with this post, the world knows I did. Oye!",1327622400,3,1789,4.391566265060241
8487030,4,B005UP4Z0G,"This Christmas will be a very special one indeed for the young & the old. To add a bit more honey to the pot, Rock N Roll Dreams is the antidote for lonesome Christmas blues.

Rock N Roll Dreams is a sentimental, sweet, & steamy collection of four vignettes designed to warm the body as well as the heart. Interestingly enough, all of the vignettes form a unique tapestry & are linked together making the film an easy view. From the opening scene to the very last frame, you will be mesmerized by the thoughtful yet humorous interludes which touch the very soul.

In the first vignette, a young man (Tommy Strasser)dreads the holidays but manages to find his way into the local mall just to purchase an album from his Rock Idol Gene Vincent. Rather than spending Christmas alone, the Rock Star comes down from Heaven & the two share an evening which won't soon be forgotten. The montages are, quite simply, beautiful. The actor playing the Rock legend bears an eerie similarity to the real thing. He even talks like Vincent.

In a time where friendships end no sooner than they've begun, we can't help but reminisce & long for a happier or simpler time when a smile was a way of communicating and everybody was a friend. Cheers & happiest of holidays to everyone!",1322697600,5,1263,4.5550660792951545
