7559233,2,B018WQBNY0,"I am sorry but these MST3K collections are priced way too high.  I'm a fan of the show and have purchased some of these sets before.  Not every episode is comedy gold.  There are some duds inclued that done hold up to the classics.
If these collections were 19.99 for four episodes I would feel like that was a better value.  Two stars just represents my dissatisfaction with the price point, not the show.",1457740800,6,406,4.445945945945946
7559234,3,B018WQBNY0,"Every time I do an Amazon/MST3K review - I Have to post this notice. - And - it's because a handful of diehard goofballs - Can't allow someone (like me) to have an opinion - and give a rating - that is anything Less than 100%.
(Everyone's 'funny bone' is in a different place - and this is my reaction - of course)
So - if you like my review and it helps you - Great. - And if you Don't - just go write your own review - and leave me Alone! (Thanks)

***Will Complete review Later - Thank You Scott.

Disc #1 - 'Teenage Caveman' (black & white); Joel, Trace & Kevin. Starts with 'short' ""Aqua Wizards"" at Cypress Gardens - Cool waterskiing - but not so funny. rating 4.5 (of 10). 2nd 'short' ""Catching Trouble"" in Everglades capturing wild animals. Emo Philips reference - HORRIBLE short Abusive towards animals - Nothing funny about that. Rating 'Zero'!! : (

Disc #2 'Being from another planet' (movie); Joel, Trace & Kevin. Great invention exchange!! 'Precious Moments/Tragic Moments'!! Rating on just his moment 9.5!!! Great!! Story about a mummy & green fungus. 1st 1/3rd of the movie - Funny!! - the 2nd 2/3rds is okay. (Riffs are better than the movie) Rating 7

Disc #3 'Twelve to moon' (black & white) Mike, Trace & Kevin. 'Short' ""Design for dreaming"" (color) mid 50's Rating 6,
(movie) (black & white) Idiot astronaut sticks hands in flowing liquid and gets burned. I smiled and chuckled a few times. Riffs okay. Rating 3.5

Disc #4 'Deathstalker & the warriors from hell' (color) Mike, Trace & Kevin. This movie dragged - and is easy to Dislike. The riffs are stronger than the movie and carried it, - esp the last 1/3rd of it. Rating 4

My overall rating of this whole set (out of 10 points) is 3.88. The good moments are worth it. Scott M.",1454457600,,1753,4.445482866043614
7559235,5,B018WQBNY0,"This set features two episodes with show creator Joel Hodgson as host and two with head writer Mike Nelson as host. All are from the Comedy Central era of the show.

Teenage Caveman, episode 315
This black and white film stars 26-year-old Robert Vaughn as the eponymous character. There are two shorts before the film, Aquatic Wizards and Catching Trouble, both hilariously riffed. This is really fun stuff with very strong host segments, especially the one where Joel and the 'bots get even with the somewhat ruthless animal catcher from the Catching Trouble short. The film was directed by Roger Corman and was made with the usual very tight budget. Example, there's a costume in this film you'll also see another 1958 Corman film used on MST3K, Night Of The Blood Beast. The movie itself is amusing with a short running time and it's an enjoyable episode all around.

Being From Another Planet, episode 405
A 1982 color film originally titled, Time Walker. It stars Ben Murphy as an archaeologist who's latest mummy discovery turns out to be an ancient alien carrying a fatal disease. The green fungus-like symptom of the disease is once referred to as ""guacamummy"" by Tom Servo while riffing on the film. It's a ridiculous and silly fun movie with some great riffing throughout.

12 To The Moon, episode 524
This is a 1960 black-and-white film about an international first expedition to the Moon. The movie has a noble goal with it's attempt to show a spirit of international cooperation and it attempts other social commentary as well, but it's hampered by its low budget. Example, the acceleration couches in the rocket ship are clearly ordinary reclining lawn chairs. The movie is definitely fun and good riffing material. The short preceding the film is Design For Dreaming which elevates this to a must-see episode.

Deathstalker And The Warriors From Hell, episode 703
This is a 1988 color film and the third in the Deathstalker series. It's cheesy sword-and-sorcery fare, remarkable mostly for the line, ""Potatoes are what we eat."" It's a lively action filled movie similar to the Ator film used in season 3 of MST3K, but with even worse acting if possible. It's an enjoyable episode from the sadly short final season of the show on Comedy Central.

7559251,5,B018WQBNY0,"And yet I laughed all the way through these 4 stinkers.  The extras were, as usual, informative.  And it helps explain some of the questions I have when watching these movies - such as: Who thought this was a good idea?

Teenage Caveman.  Wrong on both counts.  Well coiffed, shaved, nice teeth, perfect english.  All that was missing was Illya Kuryakin.  The shorts on this episode contain one of the best ever: Catching Trouble.  And the skit as a follow-up to it is pitch perfect.  The Aquatic Wizards could be the reason why we have child protection laws.

Deathstalker and the Warriors From Hell.  Well named. We now know where this movie came from.  Too bad it didn't stay there.

Being From Another Planet.  I made the mistake of watching the original version of this trainwreck before seeing the MST3K version.  Please - DO NOT watch the original version.  Cheesy and campy - and that is the MST3K version - imagine how bad the ""un-MST3K"" one is!

12 To The Moon.  Remember Ralph Kramden telling his wife ""one of these days Alice - to the moon""?  He could have been talking about this escapee from ""B movie"" hell.  This mess made the cold war look good!",1460764800,7,1161,4.543689320388349
7559252,5,B018WQBNY0,"Volume 35 of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" follows the same pattern as recent volumes; namely, the first two movies are hosted by Joel Hodgson, while the last two movies are hosted by Mike Nelson.  A young (but not teen-aged) Robert Vaughn stars as the Symbol Maker's Son in ""Teenage Cave Man"" (1958), directed by Roger Corman.  Like most teenagers, he rebels against the laws enforced by the elders.  The tribe of cave men and women speak a primitive form of English.  How that is possible is explained in the movie's surprise ending, which I won't reveal.  A brief bonus feature about the movie, entitled ""I Was A Teenage Caveman,"" is included.  Up next is ""Being From Another Planet"" (1982), a strangely satisfying movie.  King Tut's tomb is unearthed, and the mummy inside turns out to be an extraterrestrial alien!  Even stranger, the mummy is brought back to life after an overdose of x-rays.  The special effects were good for a low budget film, and the riffing was priceless.  The original version of the film, entitled ""Time Walker,"" is included as a bonus feature.  It does not include any riffing from Joel, Tom Servo and Crow.

The third film is the sci-fi snoozer ""12 To The Moon"" (1960).  An international team of astronauts, including ten men and two women, fly the first rocketship to the moon.  The scientific inaccuracies that take place in the movie are too numerous to mention.  Disappointingly, alien beings living underground on the moon contact the astronauts, but are never show on film.  Fortunately, the rollicking riffing helps the viewer past the dull parts of the movie.  A brief bonus feature about the movie, entitled ""You Are There: Launching 12 To The Moon,"" is included.  Last and least is ""Deathstalker and The Warriors From Hell"" (1988), apparently the third film in the Deathstalker trilogy.  That sword-and-sorcery stinkbomb would be unwatchable without the humorous riffing from Mike and the 'bots.  The bonus feature, entitled ""Medieval Boogaloo: The Legend Of Deathstalker III,"" is included.  Rather than a documentary, it's an interview with the film's villain Troxartas, played by Thom Christopher.  While Volume 35 is not the ideal place for a ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" novice to start, it is a most welcome addition to the collection of long-time fans, like me.",1459987200,14,2312,4.99738219895288

7559255,4,B018WQBNY0,"The previous reviewer is right that these are very expensive sets. But you have to keep in mind that the initial deals to riff these movies for the show did not include video rights. And the video rights deals most likely include some kind of royalty to the owners of the copyrights of these films, which impacts the profit margins of the sets. Hence the high retail price, to cover the fees and still earn some profit.",1458000000,19,419,4.454545454545454

Being from Another Planet - I'm not sure why the dislike for Shari Belafonte, but it's sure there.
