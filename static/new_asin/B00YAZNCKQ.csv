7209759,4,B00YAZNCKQ,"The plot was excellent. The subject matter, racial and cultural stereotypes and resulting limitations, is a subject that needs to be addressed more often in movies in a serious rather than in a joking, lighthearted way. The Nigerian actors were excellent, especially the two main Nigerian characters. The main African-American female's acting was unimpressive. However, the acting of the guy playing her brother was so good that I felt real feelings of resentment towards him. The main Hispanic character's acting was just plain bad. However, I liked the movie enough to put it on my very short list of movies to watch a second time.",1439596800,4,633,5.038095238095238

7209794,5,B00YAZNCKQ,"This was an interesting and entertaining movie. It reminded me a lot of the Eddie Murphy movie ""Boomerang"", where the player gets played.

7209856,3,B00YAZNCKQ,"Ady (Igoni Archibong) is a Nigerian Investment banker, now a US citizen living in New York. He is engaged to Stacy (K.D. Aubert) and has it made, except he is also a player. While visiting his mother in Nigeria he gets roped into a per-arranged marriage with Grace (Jackie Appiah) a pleasing looking intelligent woman. When she comes to the US she learns two things: Ady is a player and ""half.""

Everybody takes a long spiral downward.

This was an okay drama, one that might appeal to those who like made for Nigerian TV Lifetime films. The action and drama was light and not well presented. It was noticeably low budget. The walls of Ady's bedroom lack a single decoration as if they rented a place for filming for a day. What was with our ""finest vintage wine?"" Are the script writers rubes? Name the wine and year.

7209860,4,B00YAZNCKQ,"At first I wasn't caring for it but then it started to grow on me.  I find that its really good because it gives you a pure example of KARMA.  What goes around comes around.  You might not get what you dished out but your sure going to get it some kind of way, it's just payback.",1458000000,,279,3.8596491228070176
7209861,3,B00YAZNCKQ,"This is a very good movie that depicts the pressure being encountered by foreigner who travel to America to study and or settle down.
It shows the difference in culture between societies and it also show how passive-aggressive racism can alienate people who would have normally liked to be accepted into the society.",1457913600,,316,4.981132075471698

7209879,1,B00YAZNCKQ,This movie was boring & just wasn't good to me at all. It needed more dramatic encounters with ghosts or more voodoo. Scarier scenes are needed.,1456617600,,144,4.576923076923077

7209912,5,B00YAZNCKQ,I really liked this movie because it was different than a lot of movies that I have seen. The guy in the movie is not happy and you should see the way he treats the women in his life. But what I really like about this movie is it had a moral in it: a lesson that was so impactful. Basically you can't treat people wrong and think that it is not going to come back to you. And at the end of the day when you are left with nothing that is when you really see what mattered most. So it may seem like the movie does not have any morals to it or any lessons to be learned but basically it is saying do not fight evil with evil no matter who did who wrong first. Because no matter who did the evil first it still comes back upon you. I did not like some small points in the movie but overall I would have to say it was a good movie.,1449446400,6,826,3.7528735632183907
7209913,2,B00YAZNCKQ,"Turning Point starts off well, but finishes with a thud.  The movie promises its viewers much with its story-line and acting, but the second half falls impressively flat on its face when the script surrenders to predictable Hollywood-schlock straight out of its 1930 cinematic recyclable bin.  And the screenplay's collapse is accompanied by the acting and directing as well.",1449014400,,375,5.338983050847458

7209924,4,B00YAZNCKQ,"Good movie and good timing.  I have African friends who thinks their moms know everything and they will put love aside to please their family and uphold their customs. Sometimes mom's advise is not always best, and sometimes a person has to make decisions on their own and think for themselves. Times are changing and some african women are not what they use to be.  An American women is use to what America has to offer, so what you see is what you get.  But when an African women comes over here, it is a new world for them. They may come over here being one way, but gradually change once they get familiar to the way thing are here.  I gave the movie four stars because some of the acting was a bit tacky. However, the meaning of the movie was clear.",1444867200,3,754,4.251748251748252

7209928,4,B00YAZNCKQ,"Good plot.  Like another review, the lead male actor (Ade), and his good friend acted well.

Ade's wife, and the brother of the American female lead were over-the-top, but entertaining.
Watching the brother I kept thinking, ""calm down bruh-way too much."" Same for Ade's wife when she kept instigating her own beating.

The wife's friend seemed like she tried to incorporate every hood expression she knew in her lifetime into one conversation.  Again too much, and not so entertaining.

As Karma served Ade his hand, I actually felt bad for how much happened at the same time.

The twist at the end was unexpected. Although I didn't think it added too much.

Overall the plot and acting improved as the movie progressed.

With better acting from a couple of minor characters I would rate it higher, but there's enough make it worth watching- you just have too keep watching.

I would give 3.5, but there's no selection for the half star.",1443225600,,937,4.770186335403727
