8077409,4,B000AARKAS,"I've was looking for this series after I caught a few episodes on tv. Interesting in that it presents both sides of the particular battle of that episode by having a participant recount their experience. It's grainy, black and white picture might have some nostalgic draw for any old timers like me who grew up with shows like Victory At Sea and Battlefront.",1518739200,,358,4.698412698412699
8077410,5,B000AARKAS,"I've owned this complete series on VHS for years, but it's much more convenient to have it on DVD.  It's an excellent series, with each half hour episode covering a single battle of the Second World War.  What makes it unique is the way each episode is presented. A veteran on each side of the conflict helps narrate the show.  For example the episode on Operation Tidal Wave, Ploesti, is partly narrated by a German anti-aircraft gunner and an American flyer.  It's an old series, in black and white, but seems quite refreshing after all of today's CGI.  Well worth your time.",1442707200,,577,4.617647058823529
8077411,5,B000AARKAS,"What a superb, undervalued and often overlooked series.  The series is divided into two collections, from 1939-1942, and from 1942-1945, comprising a total of 39 episodes.  The 24 minute episodes are fast paced, action packed, and contain a great deal of very dramatic footage that I'd never seen in the 200 or so hours of WWII documentaries I've viewed.

There are some stock scenes, yes, but not annoyingly many, and the only time I remember seeing repeated scenes was a few times in the segments treating of the African Campaign.

The testimony of former soldiers, one each on opposing sides per episode, were illuminating and at times, quite humorous.  Jim Bishop does a solid job of narration. Personally, I like this series better than Victory at Sea, but I suppose that's a matter of taste.

One nit.  The person or persons responsible for compiling the dvds places the Battle for Paris on disc 2 with a date of (1940).  The Battle for Paris, which the series' narration gets right, occurred in 1944.  Had the Battle of France been placed there, it would have been in the right chronological order, which the compiler probably mistook it for.

But this is a quibble.  One can easily view the episode in proper chronology if one owns both sets.  I started the collection five days ago and only have one to go to complete both sets. Great!",1428710400,,1344,4.721030042918455
8077412,4,B000AARKAS,"As with Battleline Part one. The sound and visuals are great and the history is good. My one issue is that with 39 episodes there were only 2 that involved the Russians,but looking at the show from a  60's cold war view I can understand this. I'm very happy with my purchases of these discs",1294790400,2,290,4.2727272727272725
