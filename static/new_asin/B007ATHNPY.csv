8513577,5,B007ATHNPY,"Very much liked everything about this production.

In the wrong hands, it could have been a bombastic,  annoying mess - Third Coast Percussion performed this beautifully. Controlled, yet alive and quite listenable. It was really cool to see how some of the sounds were produced. The only thing that seemed odd to me was that they appeared to use a computer generated sound sample briefly for one of the ""Living Room"" pieces, which wasn't in keeping with the spirit of the performance, IMHO.

Very well recorded and filmed by someone who understood their subject. Bravo!",1525910400,,569,4.968421052631579
8513578,5,B007ATHNPY,"I just had the pleasure of seeing Third Coast Percussion play the 1st and 2nd Constructions (as well as Cage's Credo in US and Bresnick's Caprichos Enfaticos) live. They were simply superb. I picked up their DVD right away, and the sound quality and production are excellent. (If you look on their YouTube channel, I believe that they have posted the 3rd Construction.)

Perhaps this is hyperbole, but if Iannis Xenakis is the Beethoven of modern percussion, Cage is the Bach. These early works (including the early Quartet and Trio) are some of his first explorations in his more mature musical style. They predate the famous 4'33"" by a little more than a decade (which I feel obligated to mention, even though it is frustrating that Cage's career is defined around this work).

The Constructions themselves are highlights of this DVD. The First Construction (In Metal) is scored for percussion sextet. All instruments are metal, and are, to say the least, unpredictable. As the performers themselves said, the sheer variety of noise in the First Construction (1939) offers a contrast to the focus on silence in many of Cage's later works. The car brake drum and the gong dipped in water are two of my favorite effects. An assistant also grasps piano strings and slides up and down them as the pianist plays, producing a sound reminiscent of the Doppler Effect.

The Second Construction is a shorter piece, and also uses prepared piano. It is only scored for a percussion quartet. It is more ""thematic"", in my view, than the first, featuring a theme on chimes that unites the beginning and end of the piece. Comparing this to the Kroumata Percussion Ensemble, I much prefer the Third Coast preparation of the middle register of the prepared piano, and much of the metal work also sounds crisper to me.

I didn't hear the Third Construction live, and haven't listened to it as much yet, but I encourage anyone to go on their YouTube channel and see it.

Highly Recommended. I look forward to future projects by this ensemble.

One small quibble: On the back of the case, it says the sound is 48/24; on the DVD  itself it says the sound is 96/24. I've only played it in a DVD player so far, so I haven't verified which is correct. In either case the sound is great.",1352592000,3,2264,4.702020202020202
