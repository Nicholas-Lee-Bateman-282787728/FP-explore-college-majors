1256448,4,B000031VPT,"The only thing boot camp about this tape is the camo outfits they have on.  This is a good workout, a lot of crunches, lunges and squats ( I guess  that's why they called it boot camp).  Tracy Mallett is high energy which  pumps you up a bit.  I think they put thoes men in the front to make you  laugh and take the pressure off when your legs feel like they will fall  off.  Anyway, this tape is good with high energy and has good movements,  with segments that are short so you can do half of the tape when you feel  lazy or the whole tape when you want a good kick-butt workout.",967593600,5,581,3.973913043478261
1256449,2,B000031VPT,I was excited at first when I found this video. I was in the military and really got in great shape at boot camp. I was disappointed though. It wasn't very motivating at all and became boring very quickly.  It turned  out to be not much of a challenge.  I probably won't ever watch it again.,951523200,8,291,4.160714285714286
1256450,4,B000031VPT,"Its an ok workout, but its not a favorite.  I used it a couple times and  i sweat but i just do not like this dvd.  Its boring and the video quality is poor.  I think this one is just about preference.",1219104000,,201,3.7142857142857144

1256452,4,B000031VPT,"I'd say this was a good cardio workout, which based on doing the first ten minutes I could guarantee that it is, but with all the jumping, I was scared my neighbors were going to throw swords at their ceiling. I barely had enough space to do it in my living room. So if you're confined to a small space, this video is not for you.",1209168000,,330,4.015151515151516
1256453,5,B000031VPT,"I practiced this video in my living room about 3 months after having my first baby. Within 2 months of consistent use (2 times/week), I received flattering compliments on my toned arms and fit lower body. This was a fabulous way to get firmed up and have fun while doing it! I will definitely be enjoying this tough workout again after my next baby as I'm currently very pregnant again. It'll make you sweat and get trim!",1206403200,,421,4.48051948051948

1256455,5,B000031VPT,"I purchased this video to pick up ideas for local boot camp classes I teach in NC.  I have to say Tracy is hard core!  Her video is broken down into three sessions which works great if time is an issue for you.  I do suggest you do through all sessions back to back for a great work out.

I use lots of her moves and incorporate those into the class I teach.

I bought her other boot camp videos as well but this one in my opinion is the best (most difficult).

You want a challenge?  Buy this video!",1199750400,2,500,3.94
1256456,5,B000031VPT,This is my all time favorite workout. When you are finished with all 3 boot camps you really feel good about it and I would definitely recommend this to anyone beginners to advanced. I do this every night and all 3  last total about 47 minutes. You work up a sweat and have FUN doing it. I just got my husband doing it with me.,1184716800,2,327,4.030769230769231
1256457,5,B000031VPT,"This is my alltime fave video. Tracey Mallett is great fun.

A few observations. 1st workout is the best, although one of the moves requires a lot of floorspace. It will definitely keep you breathing hard.

Tracey really is good at cuing and demonstrating moves, and the video producer actually made sure the camera angles made sense. (Frequently directors get so caught up in varying the shot that it's impossible to follow along).

I love the dancing part of exercise 1. It's fun. At parts it's almost like a music video. Great music btw. Exercise 2 does some tai chi parts/floor exercises, while Exercise 3 involves weights.

My main complaint about the vid is that it seems relatively unstructured. It seems to be a grabbag of moves more than a systematic system fitness. (If you're looking for something more systematic , see Minna Lessig's Balanced Blend) or Denise Austin's Ultimate Fat Burner). Some of Mallett's other videos are more methodical. And in Mallett's defense, the vid is well choreographed.

I gave this as as Christmas present to several people unused to workout videos. This is accessible and fun for all.",1167004800,,1128,4.91578947368421
1256458,3,B000031VPT,"The workout was more or less a forum for the Barbie-like instructor to show off.  The movements, while different from what I'm used to seeing in an exercise video and effective, changed so suddenly that not even her group could keep up with her.  Additionally, I expected more ""boot camp"" exercises but only saw a few push-ups thrown in here and there.  Overall I found it too chaotic to enjoy.  I purchased this video, then went back and exchanged it for another one.",1153180800,,468,4.602409638554217

1256460,5,B000031VPT,"I have been doing two workouts from this DVD a day, 4-5 days a week for the last month.  I have achieved wonderful results.  I lost around 5 pounds and I have excellent muscle tone that I have never accomplished with other workouts.  The video has a lot of kicks, jumps, jumping jacks, and jabs.  It definately gets your heart pumping.  Definately give this DVD a chance to change your body.  Don't turn it off after one workout, keep trying for at least a month.  You won't regret it!",1139788800,,485,4.382022471910112
1256461,2,B000031VPT,"I expected this exercise video to be difficult and tiring.  It was difficult to follow the poor cues and tiring doing the same exercise across the three ""boot camps"".

There was very little warm-up and zero cool down.  The first boot camp starts out well, with some interesting lunge and jump combinations.  It made me sweat, but wasn't difficult enough for me to feel much toning at all.  The second segment starts out with some nifty tai chi, but then morphs into a goofy M.C. Hammer dance with same punches.  The third segment is a mixture of the previous two.  With a total of two sets of 10 pushups, my arms weren't exactly burning.

It was very hard to follow the hostess (though I guess if you did the video consistently you would learn the routine), some of her ""friends"" as she calls them had a hard time following her.  There was very little variation, and this exercise video hardly deserves the title of ""boot camp"".  You could get the same workout with a jumprope and a couple sets of pushups.",1139616000,3,1006,4.50828729281768
1256462,3,B000031VPT,"This is a challenging workout, makes you sweat, incorporates martial arts, boxing, and dance, which I thought was weird.  So, I like that it gives you a good workout, but the mix of dance steps with other boot camp like moves was a little weird for me.  Boot Camp shouldn't have dance steps, yeah?  DVD is in 3 separate sections, although I couldn't see the point of separating it in 3 sections, as they do similar exercises in all 3 portions... lots of interval workouts, like jumproping/kicking type, then low intensity, and so forth, which I liked.  There was not much of a cool-down period, which is a NO NO in my book.  Also, she didn't stretch after the workout, I had to stretch on my own after video ended.",1132099200,4,714,4.461538461538462
1256463,1,B000031VPT,"I've taught aerobic type classes for 15 years and purchased lots of videos over the years.  Without a doubt this one of the worst ones I have ever purchased.  It has nothing to do with a boot camp class other than the two camo-clad guys in the production.

The music was a constant beat of jungle drums and annoying, again nothing to do with a ""boot camp"". Don't buy it.",1131494400,3,370,4.257142857142857
1256464,1,B000031VPT,"I am a certified group and personal fitness trainer who uses a large assortment of fitness DVDs and videos at home to spice up my own training regimen. I  also enjoy recommending the good ones to my clientele. When I recently purchased a ""The Method-Cardio Boot Camp"" DVD I fully expected to be able to give it ""thumbs up"" rating, but, in all sincerity, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of expertise the instructor of this production (Tracey Mallett) shows. She is cute, she has effervescence abundant, she has great abs, but her ability to lead a class and make the routine do-able, with precise cueing, is sorely lacking. Even the participants on the screen have a hard time following her.

For anyone who struggles with the ability to follow a choreographed routine, an instructor who cues precisely and in a timely fashion is priceless. Most successful ""local"" aerobics instructors at the generic corner gyms would put this girl to shame. When Tracey cues to go left, she goes right (there's a technique that all good instructors know--it's called mirror imaging--and you always use it when you face the class you're teaching). Additionally, Tracey has no idea of how to break down a move to teach it effectively. Although this disk is not particularly complicated as choreography goes, it does move fast, and Tracey is no help in preparing you for the upcoming changes. The effect of this is frustration, and an ineffective workout. Thumbs down.",1124841600,5,1455,4.886639676113361
1256465,5,B000031VPT,This workout is great and fun.  I have started it 5 days ago and I am hooked.  I can't wait to workout each day.  Tracey makes you want to get fit.,1124323200,2,147,3.6774193548387095
1256466,5,B000031VPT,"I loved Tracey mallett, she is so inspirational and motivating.

Really good instruction and a nice blend of high and low impact with some body sculpting. I didn't care for the guy's in the background. What I love most is that it's fun and I look forward to exercising.

This is the best Boot Camp DVD on the market!",1118793600,,316,4.338983050847458
1256467,2,B000031VPT,"While I do like the concept of Cardio Boot Camp and I do enjoy the enthusiasm of Tracey Mallett and her moves, I believe this workout with it's 3 brief segments, doesn't give ample time for a real workout. I find myself fast forwarding through the warmup of the following section in order to maintain the momentum of the cardio intensity. A much longer cardio routine, with less segments would work great. The other drawback of this video, is the warmup and especially the cooldown section, is almost non-existant. These things are crucial, especially for a beginning exerciser, who doesn't know what to incorporate to bring the heartrate down when the cardio section is through. These few additions would make this video good. I do like Tracey's combinations and she keeps you psyched throughout.",1117238400,5,797,4.955223880597015
1256468,4,B000031VPT,"This video consists of 3 separate 15 min. workouts that you can do 1 at a time, 2 at a time or all 3 in a row. You will get both cardio and strength training out of these. The music is awesome, I love the drums and it gets you into that boot camp mode.

The 1st workout involves doing a lot of push-ups, jumping jacks, jumping rope, dance moves and jumping lunges. This is all non-stop. The 2nd workout begins with soothing Tai-Chi moves, then it is followed by a kickboxing sequence and a strength training section with free weights, then more kickboxing and dance moves. The 3rd workout is a combination of the first 2 workouts. What's great is that you can alternate them and not get bored.

With these workouts, you will break an incredible sweat and it will definitely get your heart rate up. Your legs will also be sore the next day from all the lunges and jumping around. These workouts are not appropriate for those who have problem knees because of all the impact.

The only reason I took away one star is because the workouts don't have a cool down at the end so you have to cool down and stretch on your own.",1114473600,6,1119,4.293838862559242
1256469,4,B000031VPT,"This energetic video appears to be comprised of segments a syndicated TV workout program. It includes three fifteen-minute segments, each with a quick warmup and cooldown so it can be done in sections or as one workout. It is intense, and I recommend that only advanced levels do the entire thing at once. A combination of kick boxing, tai chi, and dance, this is mostly a cardio workout. Thrown in with the aerobics are plyometrics, squats, and push-ups! The contemporary background music is live tribal drums and the studio is nicely decorated. The crew behind the leader sometimes make mistakes, putting the novice at ease: no one is perfect! Even so, the instructor cues well and each side is balanced (not like in some videos where you only do one side and quite often skip the other) Some of the moves take a few times through the video to really catch on, making this great for those who bore easily. Highly recommended to spice up your normal routine!

LEVEL: intermediate/advanced

EQUIPMENT: light weights are optional for a very brief segment

LENGTH: approximately 45 minutes

1256470,3,B000031VPT,"While this tape will get your heart rate up with the ""power"" moves and fast pace, the name doesn't quite fit what I was expecting.  Probably should be called something more along the lines of ""Cardio Dance Camp with a Hint of Marching""!

The instructor is cool, but the awkward guy in the back that everyone in these reviews talks about ruins the mood completely.  It's all I could do not to fall over laughing.

It does get three stars for providing a decent cardio workout, so if you like dance moves incorporated into your routine, then by all means this is your tape!",1109808000,4,571,4.461538461538462
1256471,3,B000031VPT,"Tracey Mallett is very energetic and gets my heart rate up. The first 15 minutes are mostly jumping jacks and push ups with dancy moves thrown in. The second 15 minutes is more weights and the last 15 minute segment is a combination of moves from the first segment and some random moves thrown in.

The workout is pretty jarring, if you arnt ready to jump around or really focus on the moves, you can get hurt. That being said, there is also little warm up or cool down, it is expected that you do it on your own.

There is a really cheesy guy in the back who makes me feel better about myself (I, too, almost fall over during some of the moves).",1109289600,,646,4.16
1256472,4,B000031VPT,"In general, I dislike exercising in front of the TV, but a foot injury has prevented me from running, and this DVD has been a fairly good substitute and does not irritate my injured heel.  I like that the DVD is broken into three segments, so you can do just one if you don't have much time or want a light workout, or do two or all three for more challenge.  Segments 1 and 3 focus more on cardiovascular training, while segment 2 is a bit easier on the heart and includes a weight-training segment.  Three pound weights are recommended, but I did this with 5 pound weights instead and found it doable.  Cardiovascularly, I would say that this workout is less challenging than a three-mile run on hilly terrain, but you will certainly break a sweat and the exercises do more to tone you than just running alone.",1108425600,,812,4.429530201342282
1256473,4,B000031VPT,"I bought this video because of the interesting variety it offered.  Three 20-minute workouts consisting of boot camp moves (pushups, jump rope, etc), kickboxing, tai chi, and dance.  I have run through the video once, doing all three workouts.

The instructor has a cute English accent and gives frequent cues.  The set was non-distracting and the background exercisers nearly flawless.  The production quality of this DVD is very good.

Buyers frequently want to know ""how easy is this video?""  Cardiovascularly, it's a challenge.  However, the choreography is quite easy to pick up.  There is plenty of repetition of the sequences, and I was able to make it through all three segments without any moments of frustration.  That said, there is LOTS of repitition.  Segment 3 feels like deja-vu of segment 1.

Cardio Boot Camp made this veteran exerciser sweat.  Although the warmups at the beginning of each segment did bring down my heart rate, there were plenty of high-intensity segments.  Plyometrics were used, increasing power and calorie burn.  There were also short segments of strength-training.  3-pound weights are recommended with this video, but I used a Go-Fit rubber tube instead.  The weight-lifting segments often use multiple body parts, like doing lunges while also doing shoulder exercises.  This kept my heart rate up as I strength-trained.

The frequent jumping and squats could be hard on some people's knees, although my knees didn't complain during this video (and they usually do hurt).  On the other hand, I did experience some back pain for the first time.  This is definitely a high-intensity video and is recommended for fit people with healthy joints.",1105401600,18,1682,5.178438661710037
1256474,5,B000031VPT,"I've done a few exercise DVDs in my time, and this one is the first one I bought and I haven't found one I like as much yet.  It's got variety- dance, martial arts, straight up aerobics, so you don't get bored.  Also, if you're pressed for time you can just do one of them to get you pumped up.  Some people might find Tracey Mallet annoying, but I think she's actually quite enjoyable and humorous and she's encouraging too.  She is way less annoying than any other work out personality I've seen.  I'm trying her other workouts!",1102809600,,530,4.36734693877551
1256475,4,B000031VPT,"This tape is one of my favorites because it keeps your heart rate going, with bouts of higher intensity followed by a chance to catch your breath.  The cardio-based moves will also tone your muscles, and light weights are used in the second routine.  If you are an intermediate or advanced exerciser, you'd need to do all three routines together to get the feeling of a good, effective workout.  Of course, 1 or 2 are still good for light days, or when you are pressed for time.  Maybe it's not traditional boot camp, but I like the mix.",1101772800,,537,4.448979591836735

I use videos to add a little variety or whatever into my exercise.

This is an okay video. It's fun to do, but it probably won't give you huge results on its own.

 I don't think that it ever really gets your heart rate up, so I doubt it will burn much fat. The choreography is kind of confusing, so the first couple (or more than a couple because I'm so uncoordinated) of times I did the tape, I couldn't do anything on the first try, and by the time I got the hang of it, it was time to go on to another move.

The instructor is really energenic, but I think that's what a good instructor should be.

I like watching the guy behind her, because he's so muscular and fit and everything, but he has horrible balance, and it seems he and I have similar coordination.

This is a good video to burn a couple of extra calories, and to work a little bit harder on your muscles.",1094515200,3,988,4.114583333333333

Afterward , it was a godsend. The 15 minute workouts enable you to stop and attend to kids, family, home, etc. before continuing without needing to rewind or restart. I also have the Firm which I love but constantly stop and restart and stop and restart (one might see how that can be disheartening and annoying) and Marie Windsor Pilates which is also great, but I'm a jump around and sweat kind of girl. This tape is perfect for that (in measured doses of course). Tracey Mallett was pretty good as instructors go but I was a little annoyed that she counted the steps out wrong at times and that other times her words didn't match her actions. I did however, like how her pupils sometimes messed up. I felt like it made them human and that I'm not the only one all of the time. Anyway, I found the tape convenient, enjoyable and challenging.

1. Watch the entire DVD before working out.  The instructor gives NO instructions, so you have to watch the DVD closely to get the moves down.
2. Warm-up, cooldown and stretch on your own as this DVD does not go through any of the necessary tools for a complete workout.
2. Turn the sound off.  The music is cool, but the instructor is not.  She's a hyperactive combo of Twiggy and Olivia Newton-John.
3. Do all 3 workouts.  The 1st and 3rd sections are about 15 minutes each, but the 2nd section is only about 11 or 12 minutes.  Section 3 is a combo of sections 1 and 2.

One set is too short, and if you want to do two you have to fast forward through the cool down and the warm up to get going again.
My biggest problem with this video is the crazed Aussie instructor.  I can put up with almost any aerobics instructor, but she really really grated on me.  I have done all kinds of videos, and liked this one probably the least, because mostly of her.
One funny side note.  There is a big out of place guy in the back that never keeps up, and is usually dancing to his own beat.  That was the hilight of the video for me.",1067385600,7,724,3.9517241379310346

As someone who needs constant motivation to get out of bed and workout, I find I can always make time to squeeze in  one of the 3 workout segments of this video. Each one is 12-15 minutes in length. Although this doesn't seem like much, the workouts are tough and you  really end up feeling like you got a good workout. Plus, the fact that there are 3 different workouts keeps this video consistently in my workout rotation, and I still have not gotten bored with it, as I usually do with other workout videos. I consider myself to be quite athletic and in shape, and I still break a sweat. This video really works those problem butt and thigh areas, as well as the upper body. This video is also great if you have limited space, as I do. Tracey is great as an instructor, and keeps you motivated. Her style is spunky and her accent makes her fun to listen to. My only suggestion would be to try to stretch a little before and after each workout if you have time, as there is not much emphasis placed on this in the video.

This video uses maybe two or three book camp-ish moves the rest is based mostly on modern dance, tae bo (kickboxing) and tai chi. There are three separate workouts.  None of them really give a good cardio or a good toning workout.  Put a couple of them together and it's decent, but not great.  The middle workout is the only one that uses hand weights.  There are several sections that are entirely too slow.  Mostly these involve learning a dance sequence or doing tai chi. The music is pretty cool; there are some drummers in the background, and the instructor is annoyingly chirpy.  I recommend the Crunch boot camp video instead which gives a better overall workout.",1041638400,10,748,4.66412213740458

It's really easy to fit exercising into a real-life schedule that way.  Tracey seems to be a little over-the-top at first, but if she can endear herself to me, she can probably endear herself to anyone.
Because this workout is certainly high-impact, I don't really like to do it too often---mainly when I'm feeling like I've been super-lazy and not exercised enough.
P.S.  If you have Kathy Smith's Latin Sizzle Workout, look closely at the blonde just over Kathy's shoulder in the big group shots---Tracey's the one in the white top shakin' and breakin' her butt!  That's what she's like on this video, too.",1010534400,6,777,4.6838235294117645
1256487,1,B000031VPT,"I bought this video because I wanted a video that wasn't ""dancing"" aerobics.  I thought it would be a basic calistenics (sp?) workout.  However that is not the case.  I am sure that this video is very good for someone wanting a traditional aerobics workout, but not for the people who want a basic military style workout.",994204800,6,321,4.5964912280701755
1256488,4,B000031VPT,"This is a good workout for people who know how to stretch, warm-up, and cool down on their own.  These workouts have minimal warm-up and stretching, then go right into the meat of the aerobics.  Most of the routines are high impact--lots of jumping.  Don't buy this if you have any knee trouble.  An intermediate exerciser will want to do all 3 workouts back to back to get a good workout.  Having 3 independent 15 minute segments makes short workouts convenient.  I have 20 aerobic and toning tapes and this style is different, which combats boredom.  The movement style variations keep the workout interesting, but if you prefer dance-move workouts or popular music beats, this isn't the tape for you. It's more of a good gym class than a night club. The other reviews accurately describe the video format and contents.",977875200,17,821,4.780141843971631

7916377,5,B000031VPT,"I love this workout- 3 short segments (I just go ahead and do all three). I had this in my 20s- now I'm past 40 and am using it in conjunction with 3 other Kathy Smith videos for a full cross-training workout in an effort to slim down. One note- the other reviewers are correct, this is harder on my knees due to the jumping. I get around it by doing some jumping and then substituting something similar (er, wasn't hard on my knees at all in my 20s...!). The steps/moves aren't challenging, but the workout is- sometimes I can go straight through, other times I stop throughout for a second to gather my breath.",1464739200,,612,4.3304347826086955

7916380,2,B000031VPT,I was really upset because I have a smaller space to workout in. I didn't know I was going to need a room bigger than my living room. Some of the activities she didn't show or I couldn't hear because the music was louder than her. I wish there was better explaining and more time to get the hang of it. Other than that I think it was a good workout.,1433030400,,349,3.9295774647887325

7916382,4,B000031VPT,"I liked the cardio boot camp dvd- the workout kept me interested and actually made me feel pretty good about dvd workouts. This is not the workout for someone who wants to stand in one place directly in front of the tv. Three different workouts to change it up and positive encouragement without being too pushy.

The only downside is that after awhile, the workouts were no longer a challenge.",1313539200,,394,4.628571428571429
7916383,5,B000031VPT,"I'm a fitness professional and have been working out a long time, and I can tell you without a doubt that this is my favorite workout video.  I've done most of what's out there, TaeBo, P90X, lots of Yoga and Pilates videos...this one is still the one I keep coming back to.  Granted, they all have their own place.  Cardio Boot Camp isn't a bodybuilding style workout like P90X, but it's definitely top of the line as far as cardio conditioning goes.

You can do the whole video if you want to, or you can do one segment.  If you have your own routine that you like, this can work into it very well.  I stretch and warm up, then I do a segment of this video, and I continue on my own with strength and conditioning exercises intermixed with short intervals of cardio such as jumping rope or using a step.  It's great, because by the time the video segment is over I'm sweating, I'm warm, I'm ready to go and continue with my workout.

It's intense too.  Though I'd encourage beginners to try it.  You can always stop and take things at your own pace for a while and join back in when you're ready.  It's not about doing a million pull-ups in 30 seconds, it's just straight forward cardio using various kickboxing and plyometric exercises.  That means a significant amount of jumping is involved, but you can always modify if you need to.  Walk in place, do another exercise, just keep moving - that's the key.  Beginners may want to try the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Method-Jab-Kick-Burn/dp/B00007JZYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Method: Jab Kick & Burn</a>&nbsp;video first.  It's somewhat less intense, although the last workout on Jab Kick & Burn is comparable to the ones on Cardio Boot Camp.

Whether you are looking to change your routine up, supplement strength-training, running, swimming (and pretty much any other form of exercise), or maybe you just want a solid workout video that you can do regularly - I'm sure you'll find this one useful.",1257897600,,2009,4.882005899705015
7916384,4,B000031VPT,"This workout is not for the weak at heart, or knees or any other body part. It will make you sweat. Not recommended for beginners. And I would watch it once all the way through before attempting the exercise because it moves very fast.",1239494400,,235,4.363636363636363
