6383852,5,B00JPFTSWM,There is so much history that people have forgotten in here. Excellent biopic! It moved me to tears. Highly recommended.,1401494400,5,120,5.05
6383853,3,B00JPFTSWM,"This tepid PG-13 biopic illustrates the life and times of the civil-rights activist and labor organizer ""Cesar Chavez."" Director Diego Luna (""Milk"" and ""The Terminal"") starts at the hot, dusty beginning and takes us up through the historic signing of the agreement between the California growers and the United Farmworkers' Union after a five-year strike and grape boycott which extended as far as Europe. (Yeah... I know, ""Spoiler,"" but we all know, don't we?) Now Amazon has the DVD so you can watch it for yourself.

We see:
  * Michael Pea (""End of Watch"" and ""American Hustle"") does a capable but strangely non-charismatic job of portraying our eponymous hero. I'm a fan of Pea's, but ...maybe it's the direction?
  * Rosario Dawson (""Gimme Shelter"" and ""Zookeeper"") is front and center as Dolores Huerta, the dynamic co-founder of the United Farmworkers' Union.
  * America Ferrera (""Under the Same Moon"" and ""Ugly Betty"") is wonderful as Pea's stalwart wife, Helen.
  * John Malkovich (""Red 1 & 2"") demonstrates his multilingual skills by pronouncing the ""v"" in ""Chavez"" as a ""b"" which is correct; made me smile... His character is affiliated with the growers and disagrees with his attorney son who wants to negotiate. He thinks it's a big waste of college tuition. He too, is an immigrant, although the script doesn't explain.
  * Jack Holmes (""Live at the Foxes Den"") doesn't really look like Robert Kennedy, but the voice is spot on!

Through the judicious use of actual news clips plus staged scenes which illustrate the brutality of law enforcement agencies and Chavez's struggle to keep his strike non-violent, we witness an important piece of American history. We also see the price he and his family paid for his efforts.

Sometimes the soundtrack seems muted, particularly during the scenes that surround his hunger strike, so if you have a hearing problem, find a theater that offers Closed Captions. Perhaps Oscar-nominated script- writers Keir Pearson and Timothy J. Sexton did a better job than I thought; maybe I just couldn't hear the dialogue. Somehow, this just didn't seem to generate the passion and excitement I expected. In my opinion, it deserves better.

Our Latino population has discretionary money to spend on movies that interest and entertain them. Look at the phenomenal success of ""Instructions Not Included"" (""No se Aceptan Devoluciones"") in 2013. I own that DVD and love it! The last I heard, at $65M, it was the top-earning Spanish language film in American history.",1400976000,8,2507,5.053398058252427

6384105,4,B00JPFTSWM,"Andrew Pena takes the role of quiet and reserved yet incredibly determined Cesar Chavez beautifully. I heard Andrew Pena in Chavez's character recite from ""The Organizer's Tale"" and I was pretty pleased with its historical accuracy.

I was also impressed with America Ferrera's incredible insight into the character of his wife, Helen Fabela Chavez, and the struggle to keep her husband and family together as well as push for what is best for the United Farm Workers movement. In an argument or two that play out between the spouses onscreen, I sense the director's desire to gently address issues in the Chicana feminist movement without taking the focus away from the central theme of the film.

I love Rosario Dawson (LIKE A LOT) but was slightly unimpressed by her interpretation of Dolores Huerta. I never knew any of these historical figures in real life, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I am also not a linguistic expert, but I felt she moved in and out of Huerta's accent poorly, almost seeming like she was playing different characters within the same scene.

John Malkovich is pretty great at everything he does. This is no exception. He plays a character who is not well-liked and you do not like him.

I had tears in my eyes at several moments in the film. I think it was well done overall. The focus was really the core of the UFW and the attitudes and opinions of the grape growers/farm owners/business owners. More could have been delineated but it would detract from the central ideas the directors/screenwriters were trying to impart.

Cesar Chavez was a real man, a great man, and a flawed man. And it is real, flawed, and great people who can unite others to fight against injustice. They most certainly can.",1461974400,,1737,4.73841059602649

6384405,5,B00JPFTSWM,Absolutely inspirational.  I have had tears in my eyes and am sad thinking of how much some people have done for humanity and how little I've personally done.  Cesar Chavez was a great man among great men and women of the 1960s who faced powerful opponents including Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon and won through intelligence and perseverance.,1438473600,,345,4.931034482758621
6384406,1,B00JPFTSWM,"Movie was garbage propaganda. Cesar Chavez treated his volunteers horribly.
Chavez actually had contempt for the farmworkers. In a meeting in 1977, he referred to them as pigs. The comments were removed from the minutes of the meeting.
Chavez, the supposed hero of Mexican-Americans, also was an active enemy of illegal immigrants, whom he saw as a threat to striking workers. The UFW even carried out violence against illegals: Under the supervision of Chavezs cousin, Manuel, UFW members tried at first to persuade Mexicans not to cross the border. One time when that didn't work, they physically attacked and beat them up to scare them off.
Chavez was also a communist and, cult leader.",1438387200,,689,5.052631578947368

6384431,5,B00JPFTSWM,Historical. Enjoyed,1437264000,,19,9.0
6384432,4,B00JPFTSWM,"This is the story of Cesar Chavez who took on the planters and growers in the southern US in order to end exploitation of immigrant workers. On his way he made a lot of sacrifices but so did his family - he had eight children and the film captures some of the familial strife that he underwent too.

We also have the parts played by numerous politicians from Bobby Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Ronald `I don't use hair dye' Regan. This could be called one sided in that it is pretty black and white in its approach, however it has a genuine feel of authenticity and seems to match what I could find out about the man. That is the factual stuff; the emotional is obviously part poetic invention.

Starring Michael Pena (`End of Watch' and `Fury') who puts in a solid performance and with able support from, amongst others, John Malkovich. This is a film that does not require very much analysis and you can just kick back and enjoy it. The real strength here is the message of unity and education and how that can make a change for the better.  I for one really enjoyed it and irrespective of your political hue there will be something here for most people.",1437264000,,1154,4.408450704225352

I loved that this movie didn't fall into those stereotypes of Latinos and that it showed that not only Mexicans were migrant farm workers.  It was a great history lesson for my son.  I feel it's important that Latino youth know the history and beauty of their culture, not just all the negative aspects seen on T.V., especially the fact that the majority of us are a hard-working, family-oriented group.",1433462400,,525,4.736263736263736
6384508,5,B00JPFTSWM,"Inspiring. Too little about his later life. Shows great brotherhood with leaders like Ghandi, Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King. Too little about the work done by his sister in law. This story needs to be retold again and again.

6384522,4,B00JPFTSWM,"Growing up in CA I remember seeing the workers in the fields, and as a child I felt sorrow for them working so hard, and living in such harsh poverty. Our world is a better place because of people like Cesar Chavez, and his family that take action, and do what is right and human, instead of people who only care about themselves, and their greed of money, no matter the cost or suffering of life. Farm workers do grueling, harsh work, and should be treated with admiration, and respect, they feel our Nation.",1432080000,,509,4.425531914893617

First, 3 of the major characters were not portrayed by Mexican American actors even though the UFW was started by and for Mexican American and Filipino American workers.  Second, Chavez was a LABOR leader and NOT a civil rights leader.  While the movie seems to somewhat acknowledge this it is not enough.

Secondly, it was just a plain good story, told credibly with some respectful acting from Michael Pea.  Thirdly, concerning themes that focus on social causes, it helps center those of Mexican heritage right where they belong, central to California's rich diversity and to its stature this nation's most influential state.

6385162,3,B00JPFTSWM,"Some people forget that this is a movie that takes dramatic license (Selma, Mississippi Burning anyone), constrained by 2 hours. The writers, directors have to make difficult choices. Yes I would have liked to see visuals of airplane pesticides, lack of outdoor bathrooms, child labor/exploitation, and crooked contractors that paid by what you picked and not the hour. The hardship & suffering were just touched upon but I suspect that if a movie shows these real conditions, the emotional depression would keep people as far away from this story as possible. And whenever someone writes a critical review because Reagan & Nixon are presented for what they were, hostile to unions & civil rights, you know the fool is blind to the history & plight of agricultural workers.

The story of Cesar Chavez & farm workers is going to be painful. You are dealing with injustice, racism, & exploitation to the fullest. Movies are entertainment and about the bottom line. So one has to watch with a jaundice eye, knowing that this was written & made digestable to the majority population. Excluding farm workers from the National Labor Relations Act of the 1930s, restricting people of color to the minimal, unskilled areas of employment had consequences. It meant that the majority Mexican population would live on the margins, there children would attend inferior schools, trying to overcome a slew of serious social/economic problems

Chavez must be appreciated for the sacrifice & effort he made in attempting to unionize farm workers, a group that the mainstream society did not care about & still doesn't. So I enjoyed the performances, cringed at what was missing, but appreciated the effort.",1426982400,4,1690,5.097472924187725

6385177,1,B00JPFTSWM,"I just watched the 2014 film Cesar Chavez starring Michael Pena, only to find out immediately afterwards that this hollywood depiction of Cesar Chavez was pretty far from the truth of who Cesar Chavez actually was and how events actually unfolded.

Here is what Marshall Ganz, a personal friend of Cesar's as well as a powerful member of the United Farm Workers (UFW) Movement who was there... had to say about the film:

 ""The new movie on Cesar Chavez makes me sad. . . and angry. To be sure, it draws needed attention to a key chapter in American Latino, labor, political and social movement history and to the man whose leadership was central to it. But it does so by reducing the man, the movement, and its meaning to caricature, a source of sadness. But fact the lessons the film teaches contradict the real lessons Chavezs work has to teach is a source of anger. And the excuse that no movie can tell the whole story doesnt really wash. An earlier film in which director Diego Luna had a role, Milk, is a film that does man, movement, and meaning justice. And there have been others. Just not this one.

Cesar was a man whose core leadership gifts were relational: an ability to engage widely diverse individuals, organizations and institutions with distinct talents, perspectives, and skills, in a common effort. The film depicts him as a loner: driving alone when he gave up driving, travelling alone, which he never did, and deciding alone, when his strength was in the team he built that could respond quickly, creatively, and proactively to the daily crises that were the reality of this long and intense effort.

Cesar was an organizers organizer, the craft in which he prided himself. This required a focus on people, their strengths and weaknesses, the dynamics of power and work behind the scenes. In the film he gives speeches, which he avoided, engages in shouting matches on the picket line, which he never did. A believer in the rhetoric of action for many years he never held a press conference, speaking to the public from the scene of the action.

Cesar could be a brilliant strategist, a skill observable in agile, imaginative interaction with determined opponents, turning apparent weakness into sources of strength. But the film depicts him largely as a creature of impulse, committed to be sure, but not the brainy strategist who took special joy, as he put it, in killing two birds with one stone... and keeping the stone. He was a learner, an autodidact, deeply curious, who thrived on constant probing of diverse sources of information: books, people, and experiences. When I met him in 1965 he was reading Churchills Gathering Storm because, as a student of Gandhi, he wanted to learn how his opponent thought. The commitment to nonviolence was based both on his appreciation of Gandhis methods and the way in which the civil rights movement, and reaction to it, had been unfolding every day. But oddly, although a commitment to nonviolence was a condition for undertaking the strike in the first place, shaping the way it unfolded, the film portrays it a reaction to events in the strike

Events depicted as spontaneous in the film, such at the 1966 perigrincacion from Delano to Sacramento, were, to the contrary, a result of sustained, careful planning. The kick-off was timed to take advantage of national media in town to cover Sen. Robert Kennedys participation in US Senate hearings held in Delano, orchestrated by the labor movement. This march strategically linked efforts to promote the UFWs first boycott, to deter farm workers from returning to Delano in the spring, to pressure then Governor Pat Brown to intervene on the UFWs behalf, and to rekindle the faith, hopes, and solidarity of the 100 to 200 people at the core of the movement and their supporters. Cesar did not hear of RFKs death while driving somewhere in his car - we had been in LA doing the get out the vote that won him the primary, and some of us were with him in the ballroom when he was shot, on his way to thank the farm workers for their help. Similarly, the fast was not a reaction to a few unruly farm workers, but a strategic tactic, backed with a team of organizers, of which I was one, undertaken at a key time in response to court actions alleging violent tactics, renewing commitment 2.5 years into the fight, and drawing attention to the grape boycott in time for the new season. The creativity, organizational discipline, and courage that produced events depicted in the film is lost entirely in the incoherent jumble of what the film makers must have judged to be dramatic moments but out of time, place or sequence, robbing them of their real drama.
Cesar was man who understood the power of culture so well that he not only rooted the movement in the richness of his own Mexican religious, political, and cultural traditions, but did so with a commitment to the strong pluralism, albeit imperfect, that building a union would require. Filipino workers began the strike. The African American civil rights movement was a key source of ideas (the boycott, for example), volunteers, and inspiration  a fact the film ignores. The American labor movement, in the person of the UAWs Walter Reuther and the AFL-CIOs Bill Kircher, provided critical funding, support, and political backing. Sen. Robert Kennedys engagement was part of a broader effort to gain the backing of the world of liberal Democrats. White Protestant clergy, two of whom were among Cesars closest colleagues, James Drake and Chris Hartmire, are hardly visible. And the US Catholic Bishops Committee, who actually mediated the grape contracts that resulted form the boycott, are entirely ignored. The first person to lose their life on a farmworker picket line was not Juan de la Cruz, as the film reports (although it was in 1973 not 1969) but Nan Freeman, a Jewish young woman from Boston killed while picketing in support of a UFW sugar strike in Florida in 1972. And it was Nagi Daifullah, one of a community of Yemeni workers who joined in 1970, who was clubbed to death by a Kern County Deputy Sheriff two days before Juan was killed, and his was the first large farm worker funeral, a Muslim one, held in Delano. Cesar thrived on diversity in his choice of mentors, collaborators, and institutional allies, but the film portrays him as almost entirely dependent on his family, and his early Latino associates, Dolores Huerta and Gilbert Padilla. The exceptions are a ridiculously hippy version of lawyer Jerry Cohen, and a strangely curmudgeonly portrayal of Cesars organizing mentor Fred Ross.

That the film makers ignore Cesars capacity to engage all this diversity, not in denial of his own culture, but on the strength of it; its centrality not only to how he worked, but to what it took to build this movement and why it acquired such broad meaning in American life is inexplicable unless it conflicts with a distinct agenda of their own.

The significance of the farm worker movement was quite real for a period of some 15 years, enhanced by its role as a crucible for training a new generation of organizers who contributed to the progressive movement more broadly, and, in particular, as a spark for the broader Chicano movement, linking aspirations of a rising generation, like the young men and women who led the East Lost Angeles school walk outs in 1968 (and excellently portrayed in the HBO special of the same name), those who formed MECHA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Atzlan) in 1969 and others.
But then it ended.
And although the role of the volunteers who staffed the first boycott is invisible in the film, the farm workers themselves seem to serve only as props. What difference did this movement actually make in their lives? What did it mean to actually have a union as opposed to not having one? And what happened to them? California farm workers today are in even worse shape than when this struggle began. There is no union to speak of any more, nor has there been for years. And one of the principal reasons for this decline turned out to be Chavez himself, the limitations of the organization we built, and painful consequences of so many years of struggle. Historical perspective is one thing, but sentimentalized nostalgia about the voices of the poor being heard is something quite different.
It is too bad that the authors of this project failed to appreciate the seriousness of the undertaking, the complexity of the man, the character of his organization, the nature of the movement he built, and, most importantly, the opportunity for teaching, learning, inspiration and understanding that, sad to say, this film fails to meet. Chavez was a public leader, not only a private individual. And while the tension between him and his eldest son is interesting (who, by the way, refused military induction as a conscientious objector, a moment of great pride for his father omitted from the film), it is too bad that the current biases of his family, who held a veto over script, and the unstated agenda of those who made and funded this film, seem to have shaped this interpretation of the mans public work.""

""Marshall was on the Executive Board of the UFW for close to two decades, and knew Cesar quite well. Marshall, himself, was a giant in the movement, a master organizer, and is a brilliant man. His assessments of the movie and of the man are quite accurate. I worked on the Boycott staff of the UFW for a few years in the 1970's, one of the ""new generation of organizers"" trained by Fred Ross, Richard Chavez, and Dolores Huerta. While the movie was important in starting a dialogue about the movement and Cesar Chavez, it was far from a historical document. Dolores Huerta played a huge role in the union, and has an incredibly vivacious personality, yet was essentially a cardboard cutout used to decorate a few scenes. Philip Vera Cruz and other Filipino organizers of AWOC were also glossed over in favor of playing up the father-son Hollywood soap opera that wasn't at all interesting or important in terms of understanding who and what Cesar really was in the context of history.""

6385339,1,B00JPFTSWM,"SHOCKING: MORE LIBERAL HOLLYWEIRD ANTI-AMERCANISM!

So the Hollywood liberals decided to make yet another anti-American the socialist movie from there far-left liberal pro-socialistic Obama prop up the Democratic Party moves. And lots of liberals here, who have been brainwashed by the liberal academia and the liberal media are spewing out only what they have been taught; they know not what they do. America is headed towards demolition, and in my opinion it shall not be stopped. Sad to watch a once great country be torn to pieces by its own citizens through some mental illness to kill itself. If you have any sense of understanding that America is a positive force, not negative, though not perfect, stay way from this wacky communist propaganda poppycock.

Why does anybody take any actor or actress seriously? There are usually mentally deranged mentally ill people, who for some reason got famous, and now their fame somehow equates to them having some sort of intelligence, which is far from the truth, and the sheep out there continue to add you laid them as if they're better than everybody else, though they're actually much more sick than the average person, which leads them to the mental illness of liberalism.

Anyone still hoping that America has any chance is being unrealistic; that psychotic socialist Hillary is on the way, and shall finish the job in short order once and for all; America shall be done for eternity. Rome is burning ""once again"" and we are pouring gasoline on the same as fast we can; insane self-inflicted suicide.

Give give me give me entitlement society has been created. The all-powerful centralized government whereto all look for hand-outs instead of standing on their own two feet has reached the point of no return.

This Obama was not vetted as the radical revolutionary he is by his slobbering sycophants/minions in the twisted media which is 99% far left radical-filled. And he slyly promotes the Muslim Brotherhood; they will consume the world under a shroud of darkness soon enough; a new dark incomprehensibly violent age is upon us. Opposing voices like mine shall be ""silenced"" soon.

And do not bother, as I see so many do, debating a liberal; not one.; liberalism is a sign and is itself a mental illness; it is the sign of a deranged mind. Crazy does not and cannot know it is crazy; the ultimate Catch-22 and conundrum. Save your energy; you shall need it, very soon.",1426291200,,2428,4.895377128953771

6385424,5,B00JPFTSWM,"Ive been thinking for several days about what to write for the review of the 2013 film about Cesar Chavez and the formation of the American Farm Union (later changed to United Farm Workers, UFW).

The film deals with the beginning of the UFW and Cesar Chavezs leadership (born in 1927 and died in 1993). The film does not deal with what has happened to labor unions since that era.

The war against labor unions by corporations and wealthy oligarchs has never wavered and the result is that union membership is at its lowest in decades while poverty is increasingespecially in the Right to Work states (about half of the states) where unions have little or no power and poverty rates are often the highest in the country in addition to 51% more job related deaths because unions are not there or cant negotiate safety rules when they are blocked by Right to Work legislation.

The film dramatically reveals the hardships Cesar Chavez experienced while organizing the UFW. The workers protesting for better pay and work conditions were sprayed with pesticides, shot, beat, arrestedall in the name of profits for a few wealthy white men. Has anything changed?

In January 2012, The Nation published a piece about Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers. The Nation reported that The United Farm Workers was once a mighty force on the California landscape, with 50,000 members at the end of the 1970s; today the membership is around 6,000. Nationwide membership in the UFW is about 10,000.

The film is worth watching, but it is an episode of history and the growth of organized labor. Today labor unions are ruthlessly under constant attack and are shrinking while poverty is climbing, the middle class is losing income and also shrinking, and the few who are wealthy are getting richerand few if any seem to care whats happening to millions of workers.

If Cesar Chavez knew what was going on in the United States today, he might come back to life and crawl out of his grave to fight for workers rights and fair pay again. In fact, we probably need more like himmillions more who are willing to stand up and fight against greed for worker rights. Is it possible that the risks and sacrifice of the leaders of the labor movement of the 20th century are all being flushed down a toilet?

My wife bought the DVD for this film at Costco.",1419552000,,2325,4.697788697788698
6385425,3,B00JPFTSWM,"The actors in this biodrama about the late civil rights leader Cesar Chavez earnestly try to do a good job with the material they are given. And much of it is timely with current discussions about immigration and voting rights. Chavez would certainly be organizing today.

I did not like how a 'tribute' screenplay skipped so freely over their subject's actual social justice philosphy. Chavez ultimately came to understand that all forms of discrimination were intrinsically connected--and wrong. The table grape boycott was successfull because he was gennuinely interested in other social groups. Getting people to care about your cause is naturally easy when you first care about them. This too would be an important lesson in today's me-first society, even for political groups and campaigns.  We all do better when everyone first does better.

The film is interesting if you like historical movies and know Chavez's actual background for a 'fill in the gaps'. It's not a must purchase.",1419552000,,990,5.175
6385426,3,B00JPFTSWM,"***1/2

Not surprising, given its subject matter, the movie Cesar Chavez is both inspiring and depressing in roughly equal measure - depressing because it portrays a society sadly built on the exploitation of the disenfranchised and powerless, and inspiring because it reminds us of the power of both the individual and the collective to change the course of history for the better.

In terms of structure and execution, this is a fairly standard biopic of the man whose name has become virtually synonymous with collective bargaining and civil rights. The movie begins when Chavez is already a family man, working as an organizer for a Latino civil rights group, the Community Service Organization. Were briefly informed of the fact that Chavez was born in Yuma, Arizona, but that, as a child, he was forced to migrate to California when his family lost their farm in the depths of the Depression. The trauma of being ripped away from the land he loved and compelled to work as a laborer in the field for virtually no money never left Chavez and, indeed, it became the defining force of his life. Thus, he returned to those fields years later for the purpose of organizing his fellow workers into a union (eventually to be known as United Farm Workers), taking on the massive power structure that, through a combination of greed and racism, kept them virtually enslaved to their masters.

What strikes one most while watching Cesar Chavez is the tremendous courage displayed not only by Chavez and his family but all the workers in standing up to the verbal abuse, physical violence, racism, jail time and threatened loss of employment that was regularly thrown at them in an effort to get them to back down and accept their inhumane working conditions without question or complaint. When striking didn't get them what they wanted, they turned toward mass marches and boycotts, the latter of which was particularly effective in winning the general public to their side and eventually bringing the growers to the bargaining table and ultimately acceding to their demands - no easy task given that many of the local politicians, law enforcement officials and judges were already in the pocket of the wealthy growers.  Luckily, the movement also boasted some powerful allies from around the country, i.e., politicians like Senator Robert Kennedy and the United Auto Workers Union. The movie also captures the fact that Chavez frequently had to contend with members of his own group who often felt that passive resistance was inefficient in achieving their goals and wanted to employ more direct and violent methods in taking on their oppressors.

Like many movies that attempt to capture the totality of a famous persons life, Cesar Chavez often falls short of the mark. Because the movies running time is so limited, certain aspects of Chavez life inevitably get short shrift. The relationships with his wife and long time partner, Helen (well played by America Ferrera), and with his oldest son are sketchy at best. Famed union activist Dolores Huerta (Rosario Dawson), who worked beside Chavez in many of his endeavors, tends to get shuffled into the background a bit more than is warranted given the prominent role she played, an obvious casualty to the limits of time. Michael Pena bears an impressive physical resemblance to Chavez, but he lacks the fire-in-the-belly necessary to convey the true essence of a man who inspired millions and changed the world. John Malkovich, on the other hand, effectively portrays an unsympathetic grape-grower without resorting to overstatement and caricature.

Writer Keir Pearson and director Diego Luna faced a daunting task in bringing Chavez story to the screen. That they only half succeeded is perhaps more inevitable than it is regrettable given the self-imposed constraints of the medium they were working in (a TV miniseries might have given the subject more justice). But anyone with an interest in Chavez in particular and the fight for human rights in general should definitely watch this film.",1418860800,,4046,5.058470764617691

6385612,4,B00JPFTSWM,"The film concentrates on the Grape Boycott era of the life of Cesar Chavez (Michael Pe&ntilde;a ). The blight of the workers is shown in one quick interview where we find out they don't own anything and are illiterate. Chavez helps them by organizing them and giving them a weekly paper to read. The strike proved ineffective as rich evil Republicans brought illegals into the country to break their back. It wasn't until a national and European boycott of US grapes forced the evil John Malkovich to the table. It was all apparently started by a housewife from Portland.

The film also covers the 25 day hunger strike of Chavez which was broken by black and white nightmares of evil Governor Reagan film footage. The film touches on his rocky relationship with his son and his chauvinistic attitude toward his wife. The charm and organizing ability of Chavez is briefly covered when he had to work the fields to gain the trust of the workers. RFK is also in the film as a Chavez supporter. His death, apparently caused by Reagan and vineyard owners, resulted in immediate shootings of picket line workers.

I enjoyed the part of the Latino community reaching out to help the Filipino community. One of the reasons unions were not as strong as they could have been in America (especially the south) is due to racism. White people don't want black people in their unions which made it easy to break them or keep them from forming.

This is an okay docudrama, but did little to raise my level of awareness or sympathy. 3 1/2 stars

Filmed in Mexico because it would be too hard to find enough legal looking Mexicans in the US.

6385617,2,B00JPFTSWM,"There are far too many people these days who have no idea who Cesar Chavez was. Having grown up in the sixties I remembered the name and some of what transpired. I will admit that I didn't know most of the details but in following up with some reading after watching this movie I remembered most and found some more disturbing aspects of the film that happened. Mostly these involved an attempt to twist history just a tad to make it suit the current political atmosphere as opposed to what happened then.

For those who don't know the movie depicts the life of Chavez, a farm worker in California who struggled for the rights of field workers to unionize in an attempt to have better working conditions and fairer pay for the work that they did. The movie offers a quick voice over of his early life and move to the area and jumps head first into his work trying to form the union and protect the workers.

Rather than sit comfortably in an office while trying to get things going, Chavez packs up his family and takes them to the fields where the workers actually live. Working there himself he develops a camaraderie with many of them. They know that he's been there with them and are willing to stand beside him when the time comes. But the owners of the fields where they work are not nearly as fond of Chavez.

What we have is a stereotypical depiction of greedy land owners and cracker law officers that for all we know could be true. Depicting them this way though just seems like lazy story telling rather than depicting reality. It's as if in a rush to show just who the bad guys were laid beside the good guys this was the least common denominator. In actuality the depth of character for both sides seems rather lacking in the movie. All that's missing is white and black hats.

Amidst all of this there is a decent presentation of the facts of what happened with Chavez and his search for justice. Rather than use violence to achieve his goals he adopts the non-violent tactics of Gandhi instead, a wise decision.  While the goons the land owners employ try to push them around and the police do little to protect them, the workers stand there ground while picketing. A strike break works to their disadvantage but Chavez changes tactics to move them forward.

Rather than focus on the entire issue he instead focuses on one particular grower. Picketing and striking against a single grape grower, garnering support from the people of California to not purchase wines made by this company, he eventually gets them to the bargaining table. The other owners don't follow suit and the strike continues. The struggle and the end results make up the majority of the film.

The weakest portion of the film deals with the man himself and his family. Momentary glimpses into the struggles his family faced with both the cause he gave his life to and the effects it had on them feel glossed over rather than explored. A history book or documentary could tell you of the struggle. Why not talk about the man?

Michael Pena, an actor I've long thought deserved better, turns in a lackluster performance here. There is no depth to the character of Chavez as he depicts him here. That could be the fault of the script and if so he should have fought harder to get them to let us see the real man instead of the paper cut out here.

As to bringing in current affairs into the mix we have other famous people depicted as those black and white hat caricatures I felt the film was full of. Richard Nixon is depicted as doing everything in his power to put an end to the struggle for unionization. A quick google search of ""cesar chavez + richard nixon"" yields 4 pages of nothing more than references to this movie. I'd honestly like to know if he did what they claim here. The same holds true for Ronald Reagan, exclusively having his political affiliation mentioned as Republican. He's shown here as trying to support the field owners and not the workers. No mention is made of the fact that Reagan he introduced a bill in the California Senate that would permit field workers to unionize under secret ballot elections. If in reality he helped them achieve their goals why demonize him in the movie? Unless the reason was to attempt to break down a political icon of the right by showing only one possible side of him.

On the whole the movie was interesting and made me want to learn more but at the same time felt as if they chose to canonize Chavez rather than show the true accomplishments that he achieved. A good biography these days should show the good, the bad and the ugly of the person being discussed. Rather than do so we are presented with an uncharismatic character in the lead. No where, with the exception of one short sentence, is the connection to his following if Saul Alinsky discussed. No where is the mention of his stance against illegal immigrants. There is no mention of his connection to Michael Dederich or his cult tactics used to create a communal situation. When you choose to raise someone on a pedestal and ignore the bad side of them you set them up to take a fall even greater than they could have done on their own.

I still think that there were some wonderful things that Chavez achieved for the people that he represented. I think that the reality of it was that he was a symbol for those people and didn't accomplish those goals all alone, that there were so many others involved. I didn't get that from this film. Unfortunately as depicted I found myself more inclined to disbelieve what was presented rather than find inspiration. Sadly that's what Chavez's life should have done, inspire. I didn't find that here.",1409356800,5,5653,4.543222003929273

6385619,3,B00JPFTSWM,"The directorial debut of actor Diego Luna, Cesar Chavez is a respectful, yet rather dry biographical drama focused on the titular civil-rights activist and his iconic nonviolent campaign against the unethical treatment of laborers by California farmers in the 1960s.  In the lead role, Michael Pea delivers an earnest and quietly robust performance, and the film's social conscience is never in doubt, but there are several flaws which undermine its grand intentions.  Among them is a general shortage of context as Luna and his writers rely too heavily on the viewer's presumed prior knowledge of Chavez.  Another is a forced subplot involving Chavez and his anxious relationship with an estranged son; these scenes played as if they were shoehorned in at the eleventh hour in a desperate and ultimately failed bid to give an otherwise curiously detached picture a type of melodramatic personal dimension.",1408752000,,906,5.277777777777778

6385635,4,B00JPFTSWM,"""Cesar Chavez"" is a biopic about the 1960's labor activist and his struggles to organize Latino and Filipino vineyard laborers into a workers' union for the first time. Director Diego Luna covers the highlights of Chavez' attempts and Michael Pena portrays him not as a larger-than-life historical relic but as a simple man with deep conviction.

The movie begins in 1965 when Chavez leaves his Los Angeles office to experience firsthand the plight of the laborers, whose livelihood depends entirely on the growers. With wife Helen (America Ferrera) and their eight children, he heads to California farm country. There he faces not only the arrogance of the growers and a corrupt police force, but also the escalating anger of the laborers as their movement seems to making snail's-pace gains. Chavez perseveres despite costs to himself.

The story of Chavez' dedication and resolve to unionize the unrepresented laborers is well worth telling, particularly in today's environment of eroding union power and political attacks on unions. The movie serves as a reminder that in numbers, there is strength. Chavez' charisma comes not from grandstanding, but from heartfelt concern for his fellow men. Mr. Pena has usually taken supporting roles, but in this film he is in nearly every scene and ably shoulders the production.

The script is overly ambitious in that it deals also with growing estrangement between Chavez and his eldest son, Fernando ( Eli Vargas), channeling attention from the primary drama of Chavez' overcoming one obstacle after another in an uphill battle to organize disgruntled, dispirited factions.

I rented this movie on Amazon dot com, and then watched it two times back to back.

At different times in the movie they have inserted short pieces of actual film footage (black and white film) from the Delano CA. area when these events were actually taking place.

The movie sometimes moves to quickly through the events taking place where I wish the filmmaker's would have spent more time with, instead of rushing from one scene to another scene. But with that being said, it is still a good movie that I believe everyone should watch. This is an important part of our history in this country.

Michael Pena did a good job in the role of Cesar Chavez. Michael also portrayed Sal Castro in the movie Walk Out, which is another good movie that could be shown back to back with this movie.

In this movie it also shows how that after Richard Nixon is elected / selected as president, what looks like the police, the sheriffs dept. and the CHP began beating the strikers with clubs, men, women, and children. These scenes reminded me of the scenes from the movie Walk Out when the police began beating the high school kids in east L.A. with clubs for walking out of their class rooms to protest the inhuman ways in which they were being treated in the government schools.

The first job I ever had when I was a kid, was picking potatoes in the fields just outside of Wasco, which is about 20 miles from Delano.

6385697,3,B00JPFTSWM,"Cesar Chavez is a movie that didn't know what story it wanted to tell. Does it want to tell about Chavez the man? Chavez and his family? Chavez and his movement? Or Chavez the union organizer. The answer? All of the above.

Don't let the concept of an interesting story about an interesting man fool you. The information contained in this movie is shallow at best and has no understanding narrative. Scenes start and end in seconds and leave you wondering, ""Wait, but then what happened?""

The movie never fully explains or tells you what happens or who people are. I still after having watched this movie, don't know who Rosario Dawson's character was supposed to be. A sister? His brother's wife? Some random stranger? No clue.

This movie struggles to figure out what to focus on and in doing so, fails to deliver a competent narrative. In pretty much 3 or 4 scenes, the movie tries to establish that there is this conflict between Chavez and his son. Well, we never really get to know the son or who he is and they make it seem that the movement ruined their relationship.

Sure that's an interesting story, but it's not interesting when you don't give us insight into the characters. This movie is in such a hurry to get to the end that it pretty much glosses over EVERYTHING.

Why were the farmers suddenly attacked by police?
What was the point of introducing the lawyer character who is barely used?
What the heck happened to the rest of Chavez's children? His son wasn't the only child he brought along.
Who the hell is Rosario Dawson's character supposed to be!?

There's just way too many blanks in this film and it fails to really capture who this man was. I didn't see a charismatic, powerful, organized leader. I just saw a man who talked a lot and then plot contrived moments formed his union for him.

Ironically, the film was still interesting to watch. But the narrative and editing was just a complete failure. It's not a bad movie, but if you were hoping to get some insight as to who this man was, you're better off watching a documentary.",1406419200,3,2060,4.551351351351351

After realizing nothing was going to change on its own he decides to step up and become a leader. His goal is to form a union and get every worker an honest wage. What seems like an easy thing to do is met with resistance from almost everyone. His non-violent protests slowly begin to become embraced by not only his fellow workers but American citizens as well.

My favorite genre of movie is the biopic, it's almost better (for me) to not know as much about the person that way not only am I not expecting anything but I am also not disappointed when they leave things out. I say all that because I can't speak to how accurate the movie is but what I can say is that I really enjoyed this. Not only is the movie very well made and acted it is also inspiring and you really become angry watching what the company he is protesting against does to discredit and discount his stance. Again I can't speak to how accurate the movie is but what the movie does do is inspire and make you wonder why the corporate heads waited so long to even talk to him. That said it also makes you wonder if this happened today if the reactions would be the same. Without getting too political my guess would be yes. Corporate greed never goes away, it only grows.

6385728,1,B00JPFTSWM,"The new movie on Cesar Chavez makes me sad. . . and angry.  To be sure, it draws needed attention to a key chapter in American Latino, labor, political and social movement history and to the man whose leadership was central to it. But it does so by reducing the man, the movement, and its meaning to caricature, a source of sadness. But fact the lessons the film teaches contradict the real lessons Chavezs work has to teach is a source of anger. And the excuse that no movie can tell the whole story doesnt really wash. An earlier film in which director Diego Luna had a role, Milk, is a film that does man, movement, and meaning justice. And there have been others. Just not this one.

Cesar was a man whose core leadership gifts were relational: an ability to engage widely diverse individuals, organizations and institutions with distinct talents, perspectives, and skills, in a common effort. The film depicts him as a loner: driving alone when he gave up driving, travelling alone, which he never did, and deciding alone, when his strength was in the team he built that could respond quickly, creatively, and proactively to the daily crises that were the reality of this long and intense effort.

Cesar was an organizers organizer, the craft in which he prided himself. This required a focus on people, their strengths and weaknesses, the dynamics of power and work behind the scenes. In the film he gives speeches, which he avoided, engages in shouting matches on the picket line, which he never did. A believer in the rhetoric of action for many years he never held a press conference, speaking to the public from the scene of the action.

Cesar could be a brilliant strategist, a skill observable in agile, imaginative interaction with determined opponents, turning apparent weakness into sources of strength. But the film depicts him largely as a creature of impulse, committed to be sure, but not the brainy strategist who took special joy, as he put it, in killing two birds with one stone... and keeping the stone.  He was a learner, an autodidact, deeply curious, who thrived on constant probing of diverse sources of information: books, people, and experiences. When I met him in 1965 he was reading Churchills Gathering Storm because, as a student of Gandhi, he wanted to learn how his opponent thought. The commitment to nonviolence was based both on his appreciation of Gandhis methods and the way in which the civil rights movement, and reaction to it, had been unfolding every day. But oddly, although a commitment to nonviolence was a condition for undertaking the strike in the first place, shaping the way it unfolded, the film portrays it a reaction to events in the strike

Events depicted as spontaneous in the film, such at the 1966 perigrincacion from Delano to Sacramento, were, to the contrary, a result of sustained, careful planning. The kick-off was timed to take advantage of national media in town to cover Sen. Robert Kennedys participation in US Senate hearings held in Delano, orchestrated by the labor movement. This march strategically linked efforts to promote the UFWs first boycott, to deter farm workers from returning to Delano in the spring, to pressure then Governor Pat Brown to intervene on the UFWs behalf, and to rekindle the faith, hopes, and solidarity of the 100 to 200 people at the core of the movement and their supporters. Cesar did not hear of RFKs death while driving somewhere in his car - we had been in LA doing the get out the vote that won him the primary, and some of us were with him in the ballroom when he was shot, on his way to thank the farm workers for their help. Similarly, the fast was not a reaction to a few unruly farm workers, but a strategic tactic, backed with a team of organizers, of which I was one, undertaken at a key time in response to court actions alleging violent tactics, renewing commitment 2.5 years into the fight, and drawing attention to the grape boycott in time for the new season. The creativity, organizational discipline, and courage that produced events depicted in the film is lost entirely in the incoherent jumble of what the film makers must have judged to be dramatic moments but out of time, place or sequence, robbing them of their real drama.
Cesar was man who understood the power of culture so well that he not only rooted the movement in the richness of his own Mexican religious, political, and cultural traditions, but did so with a commitment to the strong pluralism, albeit imperfect, that building a union would require. Filipino workers began the strike. The African American civil rights movement was a key source of ideas (the boycott, for example), volunteers, and inspiration  a fact the film ignores. The American labor movement, in the person of the UAWs Walter Reuther and the AFL-CIOs Bill Kircher, provided critical funding, support, and political backing. Sen. Robert Kennedys engagement was part of a broader effort to gain the backing of the world of liberal Democrats.  White Protestant clergy, two of whom were among Cesars closest colleagues, James Drake and Chris Hartmire, are hardly visible. And the US Catholic Bishops Committee, who actually mediated the grape contracts that resulted form the boycott, are entirely ignored. The first person to lose their life on a farmworker picket line was not Juan de la Cruz, as the film reports (although it was in 1973 not 1969) but Nan Freeman, a Jewish young woman from Boston killed while picketing in support of a UFW sugar strike in Florida in 1972. And it was Nagi Daifullah, one of a community of Yemeni workers who joined in 1970, who was clubbed to death by a Kern County Deputy Sheriff two days before Juan was killed, and his was the first large farm worker funeral, a Muslim one, held in Delano. Cesar thrived on diversity in his choice of mentors, collaborators, and institutional allies, but the film portrays him as almost entirely dependent on his family, and his early Latino associates, Dolores Huerta and Gilbert Padilla. The exceptions are a ridiculously hippy version of lawyer Jerry Cohen, and a strangely curmudgeonly portrayal of Cesars organizing mentor Fred Ross.

That the film makers ignore Cesars capacity to engage all this diversity, not in denial of his own culture, but on the strength of it; its centrality not only to how he worked, but to what it took to build this movement and why it acquired such broad meaning in American life is inexplicable unless it conflicts with a distinct agenda of their own.

The significance of the farm worker movement was quite real for a period of some 15 years, enhanced by its role as a crucible for training a new generation of organizers who contributed to the progressive movement more broadly, and, in particular, as a spark for the broader Chicano movement, linking aspirations of a rising generation, like the young men and women who led the East Lost Angeles school walk outs in 1968 (and excellently portrayed in the HBO special of the same name), those who formed MECHA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Atzlan) in 1969 and others.
But then it ended.
And although the role of the volunteers who staffed the first boycott is invisible in the film, the farm workers themselves seem to serve only as props. What difference did this movement actually make in their lives? What did it mean to actually have a union as opposed to not having one? And what happened to them? California farm workers today are in even worse shape than when this struggle began. There is no union to speak of any more, nor has there been for years. And one of the principal reasons for this decline turned out to be Chavez himself, the limitations of the organization we built, and painful consequences of so many years of struggle. Historical perspective is one thing, but sentimentalized nostalgia about the voices of the poor being heard is something quite different.
It is too bad that the authors of this project failed to appreciate the seriousness of the undertaking, the complexity of the man, the character of his organization, the nature of the movement he built, and, most importantly, the opportunity for teaching, learning, inspiration and understanding that, sad to say, this film fails to meet. Chavez was a public leader, not only a private individual. And while the tension between him and his eldest son is interesting (who, by the way, refused military induction as a conscientious objector, a moment of great pride for his father omitted from the film), it is too bad that the current biases of his family, who held a veto over script, and the unstated agenda of those who made  and funded this film, seem to have shaped this interpretation of the mans public work.",1404950400,132,8720,4.818303273213093
6385729,5,B00JPFTSWM,"As the child of migrant farm workers I can relate with so much in this movie.  Being a child at the time, I remember some of the things Cesar Chavez did when he was alive but not his whole story.  I felt that it was very important to watch this movie with my children so that they can have an idea of what so many people before us, including their grandparents have lived through as undocumented, undereducated Mexicans in this country and the people who have dedicated their lives to bring equality for everyone.  Although I understand that he was more than than what we see in these few minutes of film, it is a great conversation starter for anyone wanting to educate themselves or their children on this topic.  I recommend this movie to everyone who believes in equality, hard work, education and  perseverance.",1402185600,8,816,4.6
