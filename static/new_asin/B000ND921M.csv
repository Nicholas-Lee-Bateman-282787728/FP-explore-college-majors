2764828,4,B000ND921M,I think series six is really the last phase of That 70's Show which keeps the gang together. After Lisa Robin Kelly left things began to change and that was sad but still there are very funny episodes!,1175731200,4,201,4.315789473684211
2764829,5,B000ND921M,"THAT 70's SHOW is MY FAVORITE TELEVISION SHOW EVER!!!

Season 6 main focus is the soon-to-be marriage between Eric & Donna.  Other very funny episodes in Season 6, is Kelso is going to be a father and Jackie's mom (played by Brooke Shields, who does a great job) gets together with Bob and moves in his house with him & the girls.  Also, there is a new Laurie Forman (played by Christina Moore, but I really miss Lisa Robin Kelly) who has to stay married to Fez, so he can be a citizen of America.  This situation REALLY drives Red nuts!

The last few episodes will leave you laughing very hard with some twisting surprises!!!

Season Six for That 70's Show is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1175212800,9,682,4.459677419354839

The company that put these out did a HORRIBLE job. If you can find them - get the ones put out by 20th Century Fox released in 2004 - 2007 (I think). If you already have half the series in one and then get the rest in these ""New"" versions"" do what I did, play the exact same episode from both versions and look at the grain - holy crap! It is like night and day. I mean, don't get me wrong - the 20th Century Fox version isn't perfect but what it is - is sharper and clearer and very, very small grain - in comparison. I returned 4 seasons of this version and went online and bought the same 2 seasons at a used place and they are just fine. Now I have all seasons - same quality.",1438128000,3,810,3.856287425149701

2764880,5,B000ND921M,"Mill Creek Entertainment has re-released That '70s Show on DVD at a budget price.

==Packaging==
Season 6 of That '70s Show is spread across 3 DVDs in individual paper sleeves inside a cheap plastic case. I would recommend upgrading to a basic flip-tray case for about $2.

==Audio/Video==
The DVDs look and sound great. The presentation suffers a bit (I'd say 8.5-9/10) due to Mill Creek putting 8 or 9 episodes onto each disc, but it's not a deal breaker (for me, anyway).  This season's release is 100% proper 16:9 aspect ratio!

==Contents==
That '70s Show was actually filmed in 16:9 widescreen, but framed in 4:3 for broadcast. Mill Creek's DVD release of Season 6 contains all 25 episodes in true 16:9 transfers. (I've compared various episodes with episodes posted on Youtube and these are the proper aspect ratio, nothing is stretched or missing from the top).
Below is a list of episodes on each disc.

Disc 1
1. The Kids Are Alright
2. Join Together
3. Magic Bus
4. The Acid Queen
5. I'm Free
6. We're Not Gonna Take It
7. Christmas
8. I'm A Boy
9. Young Man Blues

Disc 2
10. A Legal Matter
11. I Can See For Miles
12. Sally Simpson
13. Won't Get Fooled Again
14. Baby Don't You Do It
15. Who Are You
16. Man With Money
17. Happy Jack
18. Do You Think It's Alright

Disc 3
19. Substitute - audio commentary
20. Squeeze Box
21. 5:15
22. Sparks - audio commentary
23. My Wife - audio commentary
24. Going Out
25. The Seeker
Bonus Features

==Bonus Features==
Season 6 includes the above audio commentaries, plus 30-second promos for each episode; A '70s Flashback: Interview with Debra Jo Rupp; A '70s Flashback: Interview with Kurtwood Smith; Season Six in Six Minutes.

==Bottom Line==
If you don't own the now-discontinued Season releases from years past, these re-releases are worth picking up. They're priced very inexpensively. The picture quality may not be as good as it could be (due to cramming so many episodes onto each disc), but this is a solid release. The proper widescreen transfer is a huge plus for me.",1351296000,,2031,4.60387811634349
2764881,5,B000ND921M,"i've watched that 70's show from begining to end. i love the whole series except for how they ended up Jackie's love interest. I won't spoil it for anyone but it was not the right guy!!!! anyway i have seasons 1-5 and i came to amazon for season 6. i have to throw a warning out here now. if you are someone who likes packaging, and you have previous seasons (original packaging), you have to be careful which dvd set you order. the one amazon has for sale (by MILLER CREEK STUDIOS) is some new cheaper packaging that came out, which is 3 dvd's instead of 4, and is in a plastic regular dvd case. inside are the three dvd's (this is the part that i was really confused about). the dvd's are each inside a PAPER (yes paper) dvd sleeve. i don't know why they would ever come out with this kind of packaging but it's pretty cheap looking, unless you're someone who doesn't care about quality of packaging. Anyway, i sent that one back because i was pretty mad since i am a stickler for packaging to all be the same, and it was not described as having paper sleeves. i found this version (BY 20th CENTURY FOX) by a seller and am very pleased with it. it is the original packaging with cardboard outer case and the individual slim plastic cases inside. the old packaging used to have 4 dvd cases each with seperate dvd, but this one has 2 cases with 2 dvds in each. that is not the fault of the seller however, that is what 20th century fox changed the packaging to after season 5 (i don't know why they'd do that in the middle of a dvd series, but it's not that bad, still looks the same from the outside). all in all this is the orignal version and nicer packaging. even if it's a few dollars more, it's worth it to me. so for anyone ordering this, if you're into packaging, make sure you find out what you're getting. u can tell in the differences of the thumbnails bc this is how all of the seasons are. the one by amazon is different, although it still had all the episodes on it, i personally didn't want paper dvd sleeves lol good luck to you all!",1350000000,,2049,4.216284987277354
2764882,4,B000ND921M,"That 70s show has many characters that appeal to every young person who can identify with them. My favorite character is Eric and he is extremely nerdy in this one, especially with his nerd fight with Mitch. Fez is hilarious when it comes to interacting with Red. Hyde is always the cool cat who you'd want to grab a beer with, and Kelso, well he's Kelso. The only complaint about this season is with the Laurie casting choice. Christina Moore's panties pale in comparison to Robin Kelly's devilish grin, but that doesn't take away from another great season of a great show that I love to watch religiously. Might I add I'm pleased at the condition of the package and will enjoy this season along with any friends and family that want to join in and visit Eric's basement.

I had to do more work by asking each seller to see if this product has the older design with bigger cardboard box set with 4 slimmer plastic case, because it is what I want. I don't really want the only one newer, slimmer, and plastic DVD case that are recently made. It will not match with my older collection...

However, I own the whole collection and in general I love them all, so I do recommend it.",1253664000,,437,4.093023255813954
2764899,5,B000ND921M,"I love this show, I lived the seventies! What a cool time to grow up!  In this set, I especially enjoyed seeing Brooke Shields play Mom to Jackie and girlfriend to Bob. The scene where Jackie and Donna discover Pam (B Shields) in a hot tub with Bob is too funny.  Jackie and Donna joining forces to try to split their parents up is a hilarious change.  Aaah - the Seventies!

I noticed a review from a customer with skips, freezes, etc. If you have a problem with freezing, skipping, etc with a disc from a boxed set, try playing it in a friend's DVD player to be sure it isn't your player. Back in 2003 I returned two different boxed sets of ""Keeping up Appearances"" thinking both were defective. Skips and freezes showed up in same place on same disc with both BOXED sets.  With the third set, I decided to try in a friend's DVD player. It played perfectly. The problem had been my player all along. My defective player was a RCA DRC220N - discarded since 2003.",1243036800,,963,4.3277777777777775

2764903,4,B000ND921M,"That 70's Show was one of te best shows on TV. I watched the first 5 seasons a MILLION times each waiting for season 6. I watched this season with mixed feelings. I liked most of the plots, and the one liners were VERY funny, but there were some things that were changed that shouldn't have been cahnged. For example:

*WHERE'S LAURIE????- THat 70's Show was forced to cast a different Laurie Forman in place of Lisa Robin Kelly in season 6, which is right when her character was getting most important.
*Life after High School for the gang?- Season 6 has many new aspects now that the gang is out of school,  (bad idea, in my opinion) such as Eric and Donna's wedding getting closer.
*Kelso=Dad?- Kelso impregnates a girl in season 6. BIG no-no, since it distractsw from the show's funny, when it comes right down to it.
*What will happen to Eric?- Since the start of the season, Eric and Donna are debating whether or not to move out of Point Place, something that would change the show majorly.

Now, to reiterate, I liked most of the season, (my favorite episode is when Hyde and Red walk in on Jackie's mom) and the plots were good overall, (other than the gang beng out of High School. BIG, BIG mistake)
In conclusion, the season is good, but not as good as some.",1199836800,2,1269,4.414529914529915

This is the second time that this series has been purchased from here and the first time I thought it was my DVD Player; however, it is not.

2764913,3,B000ND921M,"I would never fault That 70's Show for quality or content.  It was one of the best shows Fox ever aired... will there ever be another Kitty or another Fez?

But I DO fault Fox or Carsey-Werner for the extreme packaging rip-off with this, Season 6.  The last 5 seasons have all been 4 DVDs.  Each DVD was in a separate slipcase.  With Season 6, there are only two separate slipcases... 2 DVDs are in each slipcase.

I know this is a little thing but I take great pride in displaying my hundreds of TV-episode DVD packages.  Why did Fox make this change with only 3 more seasons to get to market?  Surely this saves them only a few pennies.  I would have gladly paid to have the full, nice packaging, even if Season 6 cost another bucks or two.  Very, very disappointed with Fox.  (Of course, they are the ones who screwed around with Mary Tyler Moore, Bob Newhart, and Dynasty.  Thankfully now Paramount is bringing out more Dynasty.)

(The same thing happened with Moonlighting - not a Fox show.  But seasons 1 - 4 had such nice packaging, and then season 5 was in cheap packaging.  Sort of blow the who experience for me.)",1180396800,9,1123,4.383495145631068
2764914,5,B000ND921M,"20th Century Fox cheapo'd out on this set doubling up the DVDs and reducing the packaging; unlike the first 5 installments, this set has only 2 DVD cases.  I am purist, and I like things to be consistent across the board. Finish with what you started with. Oh well, all the episodes are there and that's what matters most. I pre-ordered for $35, now it's $42, what's the deal there Amazon?",1179619200,2,389,4.47887323943662
2764915,5,B000ND921M,"Okay let me just start my review here by saying that this season surprised me. After the end of the 5th season i was sure that this show wasn't going to go anywhere but it surprised me. With Jackie and Hyde getting back together the way that they did. And then Eric and Donna planning their wedding. Then finding out that kelso got brooke pregnant at a molly hatchet concert. It was great. There were some down sides. Like how Eric left donna at the alter. How Kelso wasn't going to own up to his mistakes. The lose of the original Laurie. Things like that. But this was still an awesome season. One of the great episodes was when the christmas episode. When the gang goes back to high school for the dance with Jackie and the guys have this slow part where they walk in the gym to the song TNT by AC/DC. It's awesome. The end of this season was also wonderful. When you find out that Bud really isn't Hyde's father.

To summarize i think that if you are a true 70's show fan you need to get this season because this is the second to the last true 70's show season. We like to think taht season 8 doesnt exist. LOL",1178582400,4,1114,4.181395348837209
2764916,4,B000ND921M,"It was tough to watch this show at the start of season 6. Laurie had married Fez at the end of season 5 and all hell had broken loose. Red had a heart attack. THis was going to be an integral part of the sixth season. But lo, and behold. THey had to change it because the part of Laurie will now be played by Christina Moore instead of Lisa Robin Kelly. I was ready to give up on the show. But the writers muddled through somehow, by minimalizing Laurie's involvement and focusing more on the Red-Fez dynamic and Fez's desire to become an american citizen. Once they did that, I was satiated. Crisis averted.

Another aspect I enjoyed was the sense of impending doom with the gang. Kelso went off to police academy after he knocked up a hot librarian (and in typical Kelso fashion botched both with disasterous results), Eric and Donna set a date to get married, all the while expressing their doubts and fears about whether it was the right thing to do, and Hyde and Jackie got back together, but kept sparring over the direction of their relationship. Most of these storylines would have longlasting effects on the characters and the directions their lives would ultimately take. This season is the one where they became adults, more or less.

And of course, who could forget Pam, Jackie's mom, hooking up with Bob? This was one of the better twists of the season, as it really forced Donna and Jackie to kind of set aside their feelings towards the others parent and work together to pry them apart without getting anyone hurt.

Overall, it was a good season. Not the best. But still solid. THe best season, IMHO, would be season 3, due mostly to Dine and Dash, and the breakup of eric and donna. But still, what a show. I sorely miss it, and wish Topher Grace had not gotten that part in SPider Man 3. We can manage without Kelso, but no Eric was a show killer.",1176508800,24,1865,4.431486880466473
