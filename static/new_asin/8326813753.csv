7900942,5,8326813753,"One of the best documentaries about a WW11 battle I have seen.  Despite my Polish surname I can hardly speak Polish, but the subtitles were clear and easy to read.  The film footage of this sixty day, largely unknown epic Warsaw uprising of 1944, was in colour and black and white, and remastered.  The narration approach was creative in that two actors engaged in a conversation pretending to shoot this film footage, and I suspect that actual conversations of those captured on film would have been dubbed or digitally remastered given the clear sound quality.

I have read a number of books of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, but this documentary brings it to life in a manner of taking the viewer there as a modern television journalist takes viewers to the war zones of today.  It is a great companion to the epic feature film Miasto '44 which I also recently purchased.  It is a shame that, while the world knows about the Warsaw Ghetto Rising of 1943, very few know of the Warsaw Uprising in 1944 in which 17,000 German and Ukrainian personal were killed for the cost of 20,000 Polish combatants and 160,000 civilians.  After the Uprising an angry Hitler ordered what remained of the bombed out city to be razed to the ground,  But the Poles rebuilt the old town brick by brick, using old photos, paintings and drawings to guide them,  and today the economic miracle that is Poland flaunts its capital as a thriving modern city.  Makes me, living here in Australia, very proud to have part Polish ancestry.",1427155200,7,1510,4.664150943396226
7900943,5,8326813753,"Truly the best film I have seen in a decade, about the most untold battle of WWII..

The idea of a documentary within a documentary has taken the technology to new heights..It is virtually impossible to distinguish between the old, restored, colorized, digitally remastered, 70 year old documentary film, and the new parts embedded into them.

It is amazing.

I advise getting the version that has been done in region zero format, so it can be played in any DVD player worldwide..

I am still speechless after just having finished watching it...and about to start it over again..",1421712000,5,579,4.877551020408164
