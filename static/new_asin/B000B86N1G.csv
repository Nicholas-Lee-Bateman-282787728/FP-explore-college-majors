8083236,5,B000B86N1G,My 18 month old are spellbound for about 30 minutes at a time with this DVD.  Me as an adult also love the funny characters.  This is a must for every household with little ones.  WE LOVE IT!!!,1162598400,,193,4.026315789473684
8083237,5,B000B86N1G,My 5 year old asks to watch this daily and my 2 year olds are entertained as well.  I like that each segment is about 5 minutes long and the stories are imaginative.  I would highly recommend this as a break from the usual kids' stuff.,1145577600,,235,4.086956521739131
8083238,4,B000B86N1G,"jungle Beat is a surprising find. A quirky series of animated adventures in which fun animal characters find themselves in unusual situations. The monkey whose tail gets a mind of its own, the giraffe who knocks the moon out of the sky, the bee whose allergic to pollen. Great fun and refreshing. The nice thing is the whole DVD is over an hour long but each episode is 5 minutes long so kids can get a quick fixed or be glued for over an hour. Fun. Give it a try.",1136419200,,464,4.166666666666667
