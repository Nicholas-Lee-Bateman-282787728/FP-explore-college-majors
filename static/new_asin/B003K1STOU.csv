8398668,5,B003K1STOU,"This DVD is an incomplete compilation taken from the ""Mas Alla"" double DVD released in 2004.  The double DVD ""Mas Alla"" (farther on) has the complete concert, minus monologue, performed by the Los Kjarkas at the Don Bosco Coliseum in La Paz, Bolivia.  The musicians are outstanding.  The compositions are outstanding.  The arrangements are outstanding.  And the audio and video production is outstanding.  For those who yearn for the power of hard rock or the hallucination of jazz, this is not for you.  This music is about romance and celebration.  To get the ""Mas Alla"" double DVD you must order it directly from Bolivia.  It can be purchased from TiendasLatinas.com or BoliviaMall.com.  The five stars I awarded for the ""Lo Mejor"" DVD is really for the ""Mas Alla"" double DVD.  I don't like the ""Lo Mejor"" DVD because it is incomplete and ignores the original progression of the concert.  I never do music reviews and only did this one because this concert and it's production on DVD is a masterpiece.",1379808000,,1004,4.841176470588235
