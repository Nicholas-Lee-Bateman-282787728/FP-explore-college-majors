8690527,5,B00Q5XA042,This is the second series that I have purchased. My workout preference is to pedal about an hour five to six times a week and indoors if time or weather cooperate. Most of the winter I train indoors and have several routines (pacifiers) that holds my interest and sets goals. The Seek Out Cycling DVD's are for me the most enjoyable and are also somewhat effective. Using mountain scenery and having other riders in the scenes breaks the monotony of a trainer. Pretty well done and easy to set your own pace or better yet follow their instructions.,1511568000,,548,4.6020408163265305
