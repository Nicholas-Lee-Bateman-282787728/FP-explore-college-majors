2680487,4,B000JYW5EQ,"Chick flicks.  You've Got Mail is a classic by now.  (Just like When Harry Met Sally)  What's not to like with the Ryan-Hanks pairing?  Must Love Dogs is okay.  I loved Diane Lane in Under the Tuscan Sun, but she's the same character in the rest of her comedies, same mannerisms. Ho hum.  (She was brilliant in Unfaithful with Richard Gere and I loved A Walk on the Moon, simply because it was the 60's and I was a young girl to a woman in those years.  Of course, I'll resonate with anything from the 60's.)",1466985600,,508,4.229166666666667

2680499,3,B000JYW5EQ,"Since this was a double feature, I really bought it for ""You've Got Mail"" which I love and have seen many times and will watch over and over. I had seen ""Must Love Dogs"" before and it's an ok film, but not my favorite. Still a decent second in a '2-for' DVD.

Love ""You've Got Mail"" - Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are a great team, which is why I also love ""Sleepless in Seattle"" - another great movie in which they team up. This is one I had to have for my own collection, after borrowing it from my local library several times! Well worth the price. If you area a romantic and if you like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, you should purchase this DVD.",1439164800,2,638,4.0236220472440944

2680506,5,B000JYW5EQ,"This is a gift to my friend who have never seen ""You've Got Mail"". Still cannot believe her. However, You've Got Mail, is my feel good movie. Both Meg & Tom really do have good chemistry on screen. I think I have seen Must Love Dogs once. Therefore, I am not able to say much about it. I am guessing if it is paired with You've Got Mail, it must be good.",1420588800,,354,3.9305555555555554

2680531,5,B000JYW5EQ,"I bought this DVD bundle mainly to own You've Got Mail.  I remember seeing Must Love Dogs a couple years back, and it is a sweet and charming romantic comedy.  I have thoroughly enjoyed viewing it again!  Diane Lane is adorable in this movie.  Having Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing guest-star was a rare treat!

I've seen You've Got Mail once or twice when it first came out, while I enjoyed it, I also thought it seemed a little too lighthearted to me.  I've rediscovered it after many years, and fell in love.  I've watched it many times since.

I've even seen the original ""The Shop Around the Corner"" movie which served as inspiration for the making of this one.  Both equally charming, and even with some of the same dialogues and storyline, both are quite different.  I would go so far as to say that in You've Got Mail is the best role that Meg Ryan has ever starred in.  To me, this is the ultimate chick flick!  It always manages to raise my spirits, it will cheer you right up, too! Highly recommended!",1234051200,,1023,4.47027027027027
2680532,3,B000JYW5EQ,"Must Love Dogs is presented full-screen, which is frustrating nowadays when so many of us own widescreen TVs and laptops. Plus Must Love Dogs isn't that good. You're better off just buying You've Got Mail unless this is cheaper.",1231286400,4,228,4.871794871794871
