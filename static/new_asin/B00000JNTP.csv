I have this movie on VHS and it is a great movie. I HAVE NOT seen it on a DVD, but since you HAVE to rate something to post on it, I gave 5 stars to the movie itself. It is a great movie.",1363737600,,338,3.506666666666667

1235955,5,B00000JNTP,"I always order my Sailor Moon videos uncut and dubbed for three reasons - 1)I'm better aquainted with the dub version, 2)uncut makes it better quality anime, and 3)most or all of the cut scenes are not bad!  They were just taken out for time.  Anyway, these episodes were just fine in my opinion.

Episode 1 - A man named Yoshiku Usui lacks inspiration for his clothing designs.  He later meets Fish Eye and hires him/her as the head of his buisiness.  However, he is later attacked and must be defended from Fish Eye and her lemures/remluss, Sealion.  After the battle, Usui is inspired by Serena's Sailor suit and bases his whole new line of clothing on that design.

Episode 2 - Mina is dating two men at once, who just happen to be both Hawk's Eye nd Tiger's Eye!  She is later found out and she must choose who she wants to be with.  Her answer is to be with both of them, but this isn't good enough for them and she attacked.  TE and HE then call out the lemures/remluss, Gikkenko and Bakkanko to fight.  After the battle, Mina realizes what a fool she was to fall for HE and TE.

Episode 3 - A woman named Maya is being pressured to sell her house, but refuses to.  Hawk's Eye then tries to appeal to her needs, but fails to.  He then infiltrates the house where her and Rini are and attacks Maya.  He calls out the lemures/remluss, Auto-Biko to fight and she proceeds to wreck the house.  After the battle, an old aquaintance of Maya's named Ichiro Ono returns to ask for Maya's love and she accepts it.

Great episodes!",1119916800,,1528,4.342756183745583
1235956,3,B00000JNTP,"This is the first Sailor Moon movie I have purchased and watched. At first it was pretty good, but then i thought about it, and it wasn't so awesome. It's pretty good, and since it's so cheap, I'd reccomend it if you're really bored.",1114300800,,233,4.318181818181818
1235957,4,B00000JNTP,"I see that i don't stand alone when i say that Sailor Moon SuperS the movie was not exactly what people had hoped for.  After Sailor Moon R all fans had high hopes for the following movies.  While hearts in ice filled the expectations of viewers, SuperS left fans a bit dissapointed.  Perhaps it is due to the inconsistancy it has when it comes to the actual series or maybe it is because the story line has left much to be desired. Im not exaclty sure, but what i am sure about is that having been a long time sailor mooon fan and own and seen every episode made, SuperS just does not live up to the standard.

You're probably wondering then why i gave this movie four stars then...well even tho it is not the best sailor moon movie....it is still good to watch and kill time.  Plus it still has its moments which help to redeme it some in my eyes.  The best scene in the film is right after sailor moon breaks free of the dream box and must carry chibi-moon out of the black dream hole.  She starts being assalted by fire that quickly starts to sap her strength....she then calls on the power of the other senshi and after gaining their strength she is able to bust through the fire and out of the dream hole.

Now, the part i did not like was the whole thing with the outer senshi, Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto, coming back.  The whole thing doesnt make sense because those senshi don't come back till the fifth season Stars.  If you have watched Stars you will realize quickly that when they come back it is the first time, not the second like the movie would suggest.  So, the whole thing doesnt quite fit in with how the series was put together which can get confusing.  If their going to make a movie with the return of the outer senshi, then they should at least make it so it fits in with the series first. (plus it would have been great if sailor saturn was in it too!) But aside from the fact that their coming back does not fit the series, they make a great contribution to the film and make it worth watching which is more than likely part of the reason for bringing them into the film.  Its great to see the outer senshi again and their entrance during the film rises the susopension a bit and makes you shout a hurrah! for sailor moon.

What i find somewhat humerous in this movie is that once again, chibi-usa falls in love with someone she can never be with.  While there may be hope for her and Helios, there is none with Mamoru or Paperu (i think thats how it is spelled). She tends to always like the ones she cant be with.  Like the whole love thing with Mamoru is sooooo wrong that it makes me sick whenever is see her fawning over him.  She knows that he is her father....so why in the hell is she trying to come between Usagi and him sometimes? EW! If i were usagi, i would tell chibi-usa that she would become celebate so she won't exist if she doesnt keep her paws off Mamoru....heheh....that should get her.  But the whole love thing between her and paperu i must say is cute since they are little kids.....ahhhh...young love...hehehe....too bad they don't know about they REAL good parts of love yet. ^_^

Well, if your a big sailor moon fan like myself i would urge you to get this film so you may watch it and add it to your sailor moon horde.  Its not a bad movie its just not the best either.  The story line is fun and i definitly love the music in it, thats for sure.  I urge you, like in all the films, to NOT watch the english version...it is down right horrible.  At times the voices are just annoying and the voice acting is just poor....i haven't seen an anime yet where the voice acting was good....i wish that the producers would stop half assing the voice overs...because if they are just going to do crap like what is in this film then they might as well just keep it subtitled.  But of course it is good for your little kids because they don't know good acting yet plus any parts you might see unsutable for your kids have been cut out, like when usagi spanks chibi-usa (which i don't exaclty get why it was cut but oh well)....but the japanese version is uncut an made for those who truly love and worship sailor moon.  Buy this film and keep on loving sailor moon. ^_^",1113004800,,4212,4.2481203007518795
1235958,5,B00000JNTP,"This movie is better than Hearts in Ice!!! It is now my favorite Sailor Moon movie. 1 thing: If you scroll down the movie case (on this website) It'll say it's PG-13!!!! It's not rated! On the back it said it's recommended for ages 5 and up (I doubt it because when I saw Sailor Moon Pegasus collection #3, Fish-Eye(part of the Amazon Trio)was in a dressing room with this ugly guy and the suit she was wearing had needles in it so she tore it off (YUCK!!!)!!!!) The only bad part I see in this movie for little kids is when that one lady made Mini Moon go into the dream hole and she was naked (YUCK!!!)!!!",1105228800,,607,4.1525423728813555
1235959,4,B00000JNTP,"This movie is just barely four stars, in my opinion.  I felt this movie just wasn't as good as the two others.

First of all, Tuxedo Mask is injured during the beginning of the movie, so not only is he unable to fight in the rest of the movie, but they never show his full recovery in the end!  Of course, everyone knows he's okay, but still.

Second, this isn't really a con, but I just HAD to point it out.  Has anyone else noticed the humor in one of Badiyanu's henchman's name, Poo Poo Lan?  I personally think they could have come up with a better name then that, but it still adds some comedy where there is none.

Lastly, I just think the whole subject, although cute, was kind of boring and childish.  It lacked a tad more fighting, and excitement.  I would recommend Sailor Moon S - The Movie over this one.

CAUTION:  Not all Sailor Moon products are clean.  I'm just warning parents that are looking into Sailor Moon for their younger children, you're making a big mistake!  I think the youngest a kid should be to be allowed to read/watch Sailor Moon is twelve, maybe thirteen...depends on the kid.",1098316800,,1110,4.382352941176471
1235960,5,B00000JNTP,"The sailor scouts are on the job again and this time there protecting children. They discover that people with magical pips can  control children while there sleeping. Rini gets caught up in the act as well. Queen Valdiana is trying to put all of the world into dream state by using dream energy. In this movie we meet a new character. His name is Peruru. You get to see all the sailor scouts. Moon,  Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Mini Moon.

1235961,5,B00000JNTP,"Take normal Sailor Moon, smack it with a box of artificial sweetener, and you get this movie. The plot is basic: Fairies lure small children onto their sugar ships with promises of sweets, only to use them for their childhood dreams. Luckily, Sailor Moon and her precocious daughter Chibi-Moon are here to save the day, with a little help from an errant fairy named Peruru.
Yeah, yeah, it's silly and candy-kicked enough to rot your jaw, but I love this movie. Sometimes I need a little cute in my belly, and between the scene of the kiddy scouts and the cutesy crush Chibi-Usa has on Peruru I get more than my fill. At the very least it offers a nice reprieve before you jump into the darkness of the Stars series.",1072483200,,715,4.465648854961832

1235963,5,B00000JNTP,"I'm sure the sub is better, but I'm definately not wasting my money on practically got the same thing right in front of me. Give it a chance, this is a good video.
I think Chibi-usa's voice sounds a little more grown-up then in the anime{ In the anime, it sounded like her voice was eight, which she is in ss, but in this she sounds like she's ten}.
Anyways- this video has a new villian named Badiyanu, who kidnaps children to use their dream energy to make her Black Dream Hole filled with dream energy able to swallow the world!!! And when Badiyanu finds out she make her dream a reality by kidnapping Minimoon as well, will the scouts be able to save everyone in time, or will the vortex absorb the earth?",1067990400,,709,4.298507462686567
1235964,5,B00000JNTP,"Ok,only because I come from the uk it doesn't mean I can't watch sailor moon! Sailor moon is the best show ever! I may be a little old (I'm 13)but I can't stop watching it. It isn't just for little kids anyone can watch it. Sailor moon is mixed between drama,romance,comedy and action. This video maybe not as good as the first movie or second for untrue sailor moon fans but if you are a true sailor moon fan you will love it still just like I did!

This movie revoules around mini moon(Chibi usa)which is good because sailor moon,sailor moon r and sailor moon s did not. Mini moon will never replace the orignal sailor moon(usagi) but she is nice to hear about as she is cute and is always getting herself into mischeif.
What the movie is basicly about is Mini moon who gets kidnapped and taken to the world of dreams by the evil badyiura(I think you spell her name like that). Badyiura wants Mini Moons energy for her black dream hole to take over the earth! There are lots of other exciting bits in the film one of them is when rini kisses pereru (hes a fairy guy).
Sub or Dub?
SUB=For 11 and up because theres a little bit of brief nudity and you will have to read the words along the bottom.
DUB=For 3 and up because its easy going and has no nudity.
Well that sums it up now you have read this its up to you.",1059436800,,1315,4.177165354330708

1235977,4,B00000JNTP,"The video gave me two feelings since i ordered both versions:
The sublited version two swear words. When Perureu couldn't get the ship going he sweared and Puplan (or however you spell it) swear when the Sailor Scouts defeated his partners. again there was a scene where Tuxedo Mask got hit, was fallen to the ground, he got up he got hit, went flying in the air, and smacked against the ship and peeled off the ship. Then Mini moon screamed. Also there was a part where the Sailor Scouts where losing their transformation and it wasn't for kids.
The part where Tuxedo mask got smacked against the ship was cut in the dubbed version and the part where the sailor scouts lost their transformation was cut. The smacked against the ship was cut because of voilince and the transformation part because they looked like they had no clothes on. Te swear words didn't appear.",1038787200,,868,4.606451612903226

1235980,5,B00000JNTP,This movie is very funny you must see it and I like that the anime is more colorful than in the R or S movie this movie is not the best of the 3 but it had its moments I wish Uranus and Neptune had more lines and that the movie was a littel longer.,1019260800,,248,3.5272727272727273
1235981,2,B00000JNTP,"I am very sorry for my poor rating that I give this movie, but in my opinion, it is the worst of all three Sailor Moon movies. Most importantly of all, Black Dream Hole doesn't even come close to comparing with Sailor Moon R-Promise of the Rose.
First of all, the beginning is a little stale, and the plotline wasn't thought out very well.
I also didn't like Rini's voice in the dub, (which was different from the series), and it was irritating me throughout the entire movie.
Another thing I wasn't fond of was the relationship between Rini and the fairy-boy that she met, Peruru. I'm a Helios-Rini fan myself and it was frustrating that Rini already discovered a new infatuation...
There are many, many other things that I found wrong with this movie, but I'll make a long list short and say that you should definitely not see this movie, no matter how big of a Sailor Moon fan you are...",1019088000,,890,4.466257668711656

1235984,5,B00000JNTP,"Frankly speaking the target audience for the Sailormoon series should never be small children - premature love, gays, lesbians, transexual characters were all too often in the series, which I think strong parental guidance is needed to explain them to small children.
Nonetheless, the SuperS movie should still be a good choice in a way that the plot is developed in a much sensible way. Although as usual Mr. Tuxedo Mask is nothing more than low level supporting character (which happened since the S series and particularly true in the Sailor Stars series), the parts of other characters are fairly equal and balance. If you love Chibimoon, probably you would enjoy watching her using the Moon Gorgeous Meditation instead of the useless Twinkle Yell. Also, this is the place where Uranus' Space Sword Blaster and Neptune's Submarine Reflection first appeared (although the action development of these two attacks are much better in the Sailor Stars series).
One point worth mentioning is that in the Japanese original LD format, it is quite strange that in some of scenes, the picture quality shows some sudden down turns from time to time, which makes the movie very odd while watching it.
Anyway, if you are a big fan of the series, just could not miss it. It is also a good choice before watching the Sailor Stars sequel.",1008028800,,1326,4.897777777777778
1235985,5,B00000JNTP,I love this movie! It is very interesting but kind of messed up. For example during a part when they were riding in Pararu's gandala before Pararu could finsh speaking they cut it and then Sailor Venus started talking. There are some questions you'll have and not find an answer to them. My advice is to get the uncut subtitles. The good things about it is the music and at least they didn't change it that much ; I think.

Well the Fairies that are taking them to this land have been tricked by the evil queen, who's true intent is not making children happy! NO!! she Wants to enslave the children in enternal slumber and harvest their Pure Dream Energy to conquer earth, and soon the whole universe will be enslaved, HA HA HA!!
  Well she's no Golden Queen Galaxia, and doesn't seem anywhere near as nefarious as Nehelania. She is the Very Weakest of originality and evilness in the entire SM universe (in my opinion).

This movie is more light-hearted than R and also considerably less sappy than S. Overall I think the R movie is better, but the amazing animation (the best out of the entire Sailor Moon series!) and music, new animation for most of the attacks (!!) and more opportunity to see the girls in their natural habitat (i.e. arguing and having lots of large blobs of sweat appear above their heads ^^;) means this is well worth buying. And if all else fails, it has the Outers! What's not to like? ^_-
If you're a non-moonie, on the other hand, this probably isn't the best place to start. I'd recommend getting the R movie instead.
As with the other movies, the uncut dub's only merits are the lack of cuts and the original music, and so the edited dub has no merits. Buy that only if you're desperate or a young child.

However, the outer senshi's voices were terrible.  Michiru's voice was DEEPER than Haruka's?!  And Sestuna's voice totally lacked ANY expression whatsoever, and was quite annoying.

I was happy to see that Terri Hawk ('Serena's' Orginal voice) back in the movies. The movie I would say was based on Chibiusa or should I say 'Rini' the most. It was a cut movie that fit in with the series, I liked it esp. because the outer senshi (scouts) were in there. Some parts were funny and some parts made me mad that they dubbed Sailor Moon. One thing I noticed though was on my movie it said for ages 3 and up. On the sub.... 13 and up!! Hmm...I would also like to comment about Setsuna or 'Tristas' voice....I didn't like it. Well over all I get the movie a 4 outta 5, see the dub if you must but if u can SUBTITLED!!  ~_^",987292800,,774,3.9935483870967743

Why is it that you won't let us(I'm a ""subbie too actually. ^_^) give our own opinion? We let you give yours, don't we? Yes, Pioneer tried hard to dub the original, but really...there will always be something that needs to be improved even if they ""tried"". Anyways, I thought you were suppose to make comments about the item, not other people's reviews. (I just had to point that out)
This movie has a pretty good plot. The animation is excellent and the drawings were beautifully drawn. Plus! It shows the Outer Soldiers(Scouts), their new attacks and the Inner Soldiers(Scouts) new attacks. This is a must have for every Sailormoon fan.",982540800,,785,4.574468085106383
1236020,5,B00000JNTP,"Did you know that SailorMoon is one of the most popular anime in Japan? Japanese animation artists take a lot of time drawing and making effects and graphics for these movies. They also dubbed the original versions just so that people who don't understand Japanese can see them. However some people in the United States don't understand some of the stuff they show and they call it perverted. Well, I can tell you that there is practically nothing in this movie that will make you jump to these conclusions. This movie is pure entertainment as far as movies go for me. It's nothing that a firsttime viewer couldn't understand, and it's appropriate for basically anyone over the age of 10. It's a great story about the Black Dream Hole trying to capture innocent dreamers so that they can have dreams that are just what they want. If you're a total sailormoon fan, then you can't miss out on this movie.",982540800,,902,4.64375

Just keep in mind that I watched the dubbed version of Super S and S, and the subtitled version of R. But the animation sequences are beautiful. Look for the one part that shows Serena/Sailormoon crying, and you will know what I mean. Again, the only complaint I have about this movie is that story isn't as moving as the first two, but if you watch the subtitled one, maybe it will be better. I don't know, my only recommendation is to watch both subbed and dubbed versions of each movie and let you decide. My understanding is that the DVD's contain both versions (I think?), so watch the subs for the uncut and original version, and the dubs for a varied and a sometimes even better version.",978998400,,810,4.370860927152318

1236025,5,B00000JNTP,"This is my favorite of all the Sailor Moon Movies. The animation is wonderful, the plot is excellent, there's humor, romance, fighting, and, well, plenty of Sailor Moon and the sailor Soilders. This is a great movie to own because it is in the original, uncut, unedited verison that makes it so much better. This is rated 13 and up, but i think it's more of a 9 and up (assuming a 9 yearold who dosen't mind reading subtitles) If you have seen the Sailor Moon R the movie in Subtitled, this one is probably more sutable for yonger audiences. If you are worried, get the edited verison in english. However, i must recomend this verison. The only things that might be a problem are 'nudity', nothing worse then there transformations, the just glow in the Aura colors for about a minute, there's no details, and I would say it's not as bad as the Sailor Moon R movie, which isn't even considered nudity at all, so I wouldn't worry. The second thing is light swearing, but I've heard worse on Prime Time TV. (When I say light, I mean light! Like maybe only once, and it's not bad at all) So If you are a ""Moonie"" of any age, I recomend this to you!",974851200,,1144,4.325581395348837
1236026,3,B00000JNTP,"Sailor Moon SuperS (or SS) is the third of the sailor moon features. Like the SS series it focuses more on the lighter and funnier side of sailor moon. Also like the series, it is more about Chibi-Usa (Rini in the dub) than the other scouts. This feature doesn't have the great storyline or action like the first movie did, (Sailor Moon R) or the warm and loving plot that the second did (sailor Moon S). Still it is still worth buying and watching. The best qualities of the movie consists of mainly three major parts- 1, We get to see the outer senshi without the rediculous voice actors that was in the new series. 2, The artwork and graphics for this is much, and I have to stress, MUCH  better than the first two features. Everything from the backgrounds to the little details for the scouts is almost perfect. 3, the soundtrack, like the other features is great. I've even memorized the opening theme song (which is Japan's original theme for the series) in Japanese and I still haven't memorized the English words for it! The plot kind of follows a pied piper story. A stange, elf like creature comes to Earth and starts using a melody from his flute to lure children out of their beds at night and into their evil, yet strange ship. Eventually they come to Chibi's town and, like the other kids, she is lured out by the tune. When Usagi and the scouts follow they meet their new enemy which turns out to be a boy that Chibi had just met. He takes the children back to another dimension and the scouts follow to save Chibi. When they get there they find the evil queen that the elves were working for and she reveals her master plan to use the dream energy from children to create a ""Black Dream Hole"", hence the name of the dub, to suck the earth into, where the children there will live in a dream world forever (Cue evil laugh). Anyway, this third feature isn't up to SM great standards, Besides from the graphics, but it's still worth seeing. This, like S, doesn't have much violence in it. Except towards the end where Usagi and Rini are getting battered and beaten by the dream hole. Even this, though, is mild. Still the barbie doll like transformations are there, but, this is still the best feature for the younger audience. I haven't seen the dub yet, but I've heard it's supposed to be the best of Pioneer's SM dubs with them bringing the original voice artists. I wasn't crazy about the first set of voice actors and I DEFINATELY didn't like their replacements. Also, Chibi Moon, as is her name in the sub, has been changed to ""Mini Moon."" While this might seem cute for the younger audience, the real fans are a little anoyed by it. In the dub though, I think it fits quite well, for the main reason it fits her oh-so-sweet kiddy voice. Even though she is a kid and the dub is aimed at younger viewers, I still think they could have stayed a little more true to the real Chibi. I mean for Pete's sake she is a sailor soldier in training! Also, the voice for Diana, who is Luna's and Artemis' future daughter, is extremely bad and irritating in the dub. Once again the kids might like it though, which is the point. So unless this is for very young kids, my advice is, like always, is get the sub first. If you like it, then try the dub.",973814400,,3256,4.364085667215815
1236027,5,B00000JNTP,"This was a great movie in my opinion.  I'm a ""moonie"" as some would say.  As others have said Diana's voice is pretty bad and really could use improving.  Everything else is really awesome. The senshi's henshins definitely could have been better.  In the Cartoon Network dubs they kept some of the original henshins.  I really enjoy the outer senshi the most, most likely that they are some of the most powerful scouts. When I first saw Badiyanu I first thought she was Galaxia but I quickly changed my mind when I saw that her decor was slightly different.  Her ""minions"" are slightly on the freakish side but very interesting, almost like the amazoness quarted and the amazon trio in the tv series.",973555200,,700,4.650406504065041
1236028,3,B00000JNTP,"OK, first of all, SoS keeps babbling about how this is the best one that Pioneer has dubbed. Um, no. They changed her transformation phrase to Super Moon Crisis Power! and cut out a part of Usagi(Serena) spanking Chibiusa (Rini), Diana's voice souds HORRID (That's kinda better on the SUperS show now) When Serena is in Darien's aprtment, they play ""nothing At All"" which so doesn't fit. Once again, Pioneer is just leading people to beleive that Usagi and Mamoru (Darien) are just friends! And everone says how they loved the Japanese music cues. That little synthesizer keyboard bit they used to play during Moon's transformation just doesn't work for Crisis Make-Up! They changed tons of dialogue (and don't tell me it's so little kids understand!) like Three o Clock Fairy to Three o Clock Monday and all the dialogue when they're standing in Lita's Apartmen is changed. I think that the sound quality is better in the sub. I had to turn it up REALLY loud to make out what they said durring the Crisis Make-Up! The DiC Tuxedo Mask music sounded really bad when Tuxedo Mask appeared, the original would have sounded so much better! Now, therre are good things abotu the Dub: 1. TERRI!!! Terri Hawkes is back! 2. I love what Mamoru says to Usagi in the apartment! His little speech there tops the Japanese one! 3. It IS bettee than DiC, but not like Cloverway! 4. Some of the dialoguew wasn't changed from the original.  Still, I recomend you buy the subtittled version or the billingual DVD!",971568000,,1494,4.702290076335878

Another was where the Sailor Senshi had their  powers removed, so they looked sort of naked, yet there were no actual  parts drawn...you Sailor Moon fans know what I'm talking about, I'm sure.  They changed a good lot of the words around. It's plain ridiculous. If  you're a hardcore Sailor Moon fan, I recommend the subbed version.",968025600,,508,4.467391304347826
1236036,5,B00000JNTP,"Pioneer's third VHS dub, Sailor Moon SuperS was absolutely fantastic.  Not only did they leave in more clips of Japanese music, which was  disappointing not to hear, but there were very little cuts.  One thing that  Pioneer confuses me about is the fact that they take out a scene where  Serena spanks Rini to wake her up, yet the violent scenes remained.  Sheesh, are they looking for more reasons to get people to buy their  DVD?
Anyways, this story had a good plot, and I was glad to see Terri  Hawkes return as Sailor Moon before she had to leave on pregnancy.  I hope  to see you soon in the upcoming episodes, Terri!
As for the new  additions, Diana's voice didn't bother me that much, just a little bit too  high pitched.  But this movie had a good plot, and had a good finish,  too!
So, for those who absolutely hate the dub, I think you should stop  wasting your time trying to find bad reviews for this movie.  This movie  was awesome, and I can't wait to get my hands on the sub!",967766400,,990,4.293478260869565

I watched it with her and I say  they were things they can make more clearer. Like the part when the evil  villian wanted to take over Earth. But why no ideal?I just can't believe how  Sailor Moon attracted such a huge crowd. My daughter is hook on it. That's  all she ever talks about. But the cute part that had us going ahh.

1236048,2,B00000JNTP,"For the most part, this movie was a lot like the Dic dub. Whether or not that's good is up to personal choice. Personally, that's a minus for me. I  was, however, impressed that they kept the Japanese song ""Sanji No  Yousei,"" the song that the kids sing, in the movie. I also liked  hearing the original voice cast again. If not for Terri Hawks, I doubt I  would have liked this as much as I did. Even still, they added a lot of  dopey Dic music and that was the least enjoyable part for me. I would not  recommend this movie for a fan of the Japanese ""Sailor Moon.""  This is more suited to kids and American dub fans.",967248000,,618,4.1
1236049,3,B00000JNTP,"This is the first SailorMoon movie I bought after seeing the subtitled version.  I bought SailorMoon R and S without seeing the subbed versions  and I was very pleased with them.  I noticed that there were scenes added  in the the dub in order to remove certain scenes that are 'not suitable'  for younger audiences (i.e. The sailor scouts glow in their auras while  being nude after their suits are taken away.  Glowing Barbie dolls.)  The  story is kept the same if compared to the dub but, the original music was  replaced by the DIC music which turned out to be somewhat of a  dissapointment.",966816000,,596,4.580952380952381
1236050,5,B00000JNTP,"I just finished watching the SuperS movie, Black Dream Whole. I enjoyed it and is by far the best Sailor Moon feature.  However, I did find a few  problems with it.  The changes that were made are very confusing.  For  instance, the Three O'Clock Fairy was changed to Three O'clock Monday.  WHY!  Also one big noticable change is the music edits.  The original  music was kept in the television series, so why change it in the movie?  All I heard was DiC music (AH!)...with perhaps a two-second feed of  original music.  I can't understand why they changed it in the first place.  The edits they did can be reasoned, but I'd rather watch the unedited  dubbed version.  And Terry Hawkes returns as the voice for Serena/Sailor  Moon.  Thank goodness!  Only Terry can do it right!  She totally saved the  film.  All the original voice actor's and actresses return as well  (although the voice actress for Pluto is not Susan Aceron from TV who  should've performed it.  And what's with Diana's voice! ).  And if I'm not  mistaken, the actors who did the voices of Zoicite and Rubeus in the TV  series also perform in this movie.  They also didn't translate the  ""candy song"" the children sing, which would only confuse kids  more if trying to understand it.  Positive things about the movie?  The  Super forms and transformations of the soldiers with their powers finally  in English; the intro of Diana; the yet-to-be-seen-on-TV transformation for  Super Sailor Moon & Mini Moon; and of course the return of the original  actors. Overall the movie is great and it's fantastic to have the original  actors back (even the actress for Rini). I only hope Terry Hawkes can  return for the dubbing of the SuperS series. Kids will definetly enjoy this  version, but more adult fans should get the unedited version on DVD.",966816000,,1811,4.737864077669903
1236051,4,B00000JNTP,"Well, this is the last of the salior moon movies to be released and I must  say that I am impressed.  The DVD features kept getting better and better  with its offerings.
There are some things I liked and things that I  didn't like.  The one thing that almost threw me off was the original voice  actors coming on this DVD.  Having become accustomed to the new dubbed  voices on SMS the TV series, was a welcomed comfort.
Still hated the  shrill voice of Pluto and the high voice of Uranus, but given this was made  last year, I can take some comfort in saying that the dubbed voices in the  series got a little better.
This is the best version that is out there.  For purists who can't stand dubbed voices, here's the subbed version.  For  those who love dubbed voices, here's the dubbed version on the same DVD.  Plus you get to compare the two.
So, buy the DVD version.",966816000,,872,4.296296296296297
1236052,3,B00000JNTP,"I saw this movie a year ago and I remember how I felt that it was good but more geared to the younger audience and also how that song the kids were  singing kept staying in my head.
The story focuses this time on Chibi  Usa or Mini Moon (whatever name the Dub uses).  The movie is definitely  geared for a younger audience and the parts that make you feel sad like in  the previous movies, is not here in the fourth movie.  In my opinion, I  feel that this movie is the weakest of all Sailor Moon movies.
When I say  weak...I don't mean bad...I mean it doesn't make me want to watch this many  times.  I like the sad storylines...btw, for the Sailor Moon fans.. I was  hoping they would get Sailor Saturn in this movie but I guess that psycho  storyline on Sailor Moon S was too scary for kids.
As for the  animation, I'm glad it wasn't as faded as Sailor Moon S but where the DVD  for R was an improvement over it's predecessor, this DVD is not better than  R...  Not much in terms for special features this time around.  The  production stills are still nice but I wonder why they never include the  movie trailers.  Those trailers are pretty cool!
Anyway, if you have  bought the other two DVD's and are a fan of the series, you will most  likely purchase this DVD anyway.  But if you are a fan and don't know which  DVD to buy out of the three movies, start with the first one and go in  continuation.  A definite must-see for fans of Chibi Usa.  For fans of the  anime, a slight above average movie.",966729600,,1504,4.164335664335664

1236054,4,B00000JNTP,"Well, this is the third and final installment of the Sailor Moon movie series.  I have to say, in terms of dubbing, this is probably the best of  the lot.  The attacks were translated properly, although they STILL insist  on having Pluto shout her attack (watch the japanese series...she whispers  it!).  My biggest gripe was the kitchen scene...they kinda dumbed it down,  which kinda annoyed me...the japanese version was more dramatic and  personal...this one was pretty superficial.  Diana's voice irritated me to  no end as well...but since the powers that be refuse to dub season 5  (although they should...hint, hint, HINT)so i won't have to worry about that  ever again.  They timed the release of this video well, since by this time  season 3 has finished its initial run here in the states, so we're all  familiar with the Outer Senshi.  Overall it was a really good dub...the  story was not as butchered as the first, and the voices were better than  the second in terms of the Outer Soldiers.  Well, enjoy!  Me, i can't wait  for season 4 to begin, and hopefully we'll eventually get season 5 so we  can see the whole series here in the states!",966556800,,1156,4.703517587939698
1236055,3,B00000JNTP,"As y'all know, the new Sailor Moon Super S (""Black DreamHole"") was just released this Tuesday...  The sound quality of the movie bites. An example of this would be Sailor Moon and Sailor Mini Moon launch into their attack ""Moon Gorgeous Meditation"" (if you have the sub version, when you know what I'm talkin about). I could hardly hear what they were saying til I turned up my TV really loud. Another problem with the movie is when they transform. When Serena (Usagi) and Rini (Chibi-Usa) yell, ""Super Moon Crisis Power"", it sounds like the 2 people voicing them were trying too hard to say it in sync. That ruined the whole transformation sequence for me. On the other hand, some things needed to be done a different way. I like the Sailor Scouts's transformation sequences and I like the way Sailor Pluto screamed out her Dead Scream attack (FINALLY!). The plot was good and so was the movie, but I suggest to you Sailor Moon fans to save your money and buy the subtitled version instead. Get the dubbed versions of Sailor Moon R and S, but NOT Super S. It's a waste of time and money.",966470400,,1088,4.494949494949495
1236056,5,B00000JNTP,"This movie was dubbed fairly well and it has a good introduction. However,  I thought the movie would of turned out better if Serena and Rini's  original voices weren't used. Other than that, there are very few negative  points about the movie.
Negative: Pioneer skipped the part where we were  supposed to see a picture of each Sailor Scout when they were little.  Diana's voice was not at all that good. It seems as though Diana has  aquired Molly's New York accent. Instead of saying ""Rini"", it  sounds more like ""Weenie"". As you all probably know, original  music was changed.
Posutive: It's good to get a first look at Diana and  the Sailor Scout's new transformation sequences. Here are their powers:  Sailor Mercury: Mercury Aqua Rhapsody Sailor Mars: Mars Flame Sniper Sailor  Jupiter: Jupiter Oak Evolution Sailor Venus: Venus Love And Beauty  Shock
Sailor Moon and Mini Moon: Super Moon Crisis Make Up, I think  Pioneer added some extra words there
Here are what the Scout's are  fighting:  Candy wrappers: They unwrap to reveal a  blue ball that turns into a little creature that bounces around  Bon Bon Daddies: These are the same as the candy wrappers but 5x as  powerful.

1236077,4,B00000JNTP,"Last autumn I bought the subtitled version of the Super S movie. I know plenty of people who absolutely loved it, but personally I felt like I had  wasted my money and an hour of my life watching the thing. So you can  imagine my attitude going into watching the dub version was one out of  obligation instead of any real desire. Despite my own presumption and my  immediate detest of Diana's voice, I really enjoyed this movie. In her  final outing as the title character, Terri Hawkes delivers a top rate  performance. And Tracey Hoyt (also probably in a last appearance) is at her  very best as the voice of Rini, making me wish that the english script  writers for season two had tried a little harder to establish the character  as likable. I'm not sure who the male actors playing the fairies were, but  I was really impressed with them. On that note though, why was Pioneer  compelled to strike the three o'clock fairy legend out of the script?  The  story is pretty simple, and it works in the favor of the translation. The  dub version being notorious for removing dramatic tension is in a rather  bizarre situation here, where toning down scenes and adding more  personality to the sailors actually creates drama. I'm talking about the  scene where the evil being explains her motivation to Sailor Moon, why she  wants to put everyone on earth in a dream state. Toned down as it is in the  dub, you almost get the impression she's trying to do the earth a favor.  Then in the final battle she talks about devouring the world. It's never  stated explicitly so Pioneer may not have put in the life's  actions-over-words lesson intentionally but in the earlier scene, the  villain comes off as blatantly LYING. And Sailor Moon comes off as seeing  through it. It's a beautiful moment when that connection is made. I  certainly think children will be entertained by the movie, and they may  even learn something useful, regrettably about a lot of people they're  going to wind up meeting in their lives.",966124800,,2009,4.6335227272727275

1236082,3,B00000JNTP,"Before Christmas I purchased the video's for the R and Super S movie, and I was really quite taken by both, R for its sincerity and SS for its fun plot.  The Super S movie turned out to be my favorite of all the movies, (I  purchased the S a few months ago,) because its storyline was well written  for people who weren't interested in seeing a new part of the series, just  a nice adventure set aside from what was going on in the television.  This  was the first time (for me) where Chibi Usa started to look and act more  grown up.  Her relationship with the boy Peruru in the movie is sweet and  innocent and you kinda wish something had happened between them.  Sailor  Moon showed some real grit and guts and for once, as a mother to Chibi Usa  and as the leader of the senshi, and happily, like R, she didn't bore the  main villain with a long speech.  If you're a Sailor Moon Fan who has yet  to see what's to become of the senshi in later series, this gives you a  slight taste of everything save for the plot.

1236085,3,B00000JNTP,"As the third consecutive Sailor Moon film, SailorMoon:SuperS features an absolutely lovely musical score, and is without a doubt the most beautifully animated SM adventure yet! It's obvious the studio put a lot of  money into this production. It also has an incredibly charming opening  credit sequence that is probably the cutest part of the entire film series!
 The fairly straightforward plot introduces the evil Lady Vadiane, a  giant magical being who sends her 3 Fairy minions to Earth to capture  children. She plans to use their 'Sugar Energy' to power a giant black hole  with which to absorb the entire Earth! After Chibi-Usa (Rini) is captured  in one of the raids, it's up to the Sailor Team to rescue her and save the  world yet again.
  Some familiarity with the original series might be  helpful before watching since the girls all have new attacks, and new  Senshi and a new feline character have been added to the cast. It's not  absolutely necessary though.
 There is some implied nudity in the form of  drawn outlines of the girls bodies in rainbow colored energy forms. But  parents would probably be hard-pressed to find this one scene offensive for  younger viewers.
 In fact, it's probably younger fans who'll get more out  of this one, with it's colorful attacks, cute production designs, and  nonstop action. For more mature SM lovers; aside from the usual powerful  bonds between the girls, some fun moments with Usagi(Serina) and her  long-suffering boyfriend Mamoru(Darien) and the usual comedic bickering  between Chibi-Usa and Usagi, there isn't a whole lot here. Good heros need  good enemies and in this case, Vadiane just doesn't cut it. She's a very  powerful being, but an extremely one-dimensional one. There's no  explaination of exactly WHY she wants to destroy the Earth, other than just  being evil. This really hurts the films sense of drama, as the evil Queen  just becomes another straw figure to be easily knocked over by Usagi and  friends. It's such a pity that an otherwise fine production has to fall  down in this one respect. I know it can be difficult to creat an  interesting character with less than an hour of screentime to work with,  but surely a few throwaway lines couldn't have hurt.
 All in all though  it's a good adventure to add to your Sailor Moon collection, but definately  purchase the R and S movies first.",962928000,,2374,4.864661654135339

The English version of the film will more than likely be edited to clarify certain tings.

1236106,3,B00000JNTP,"This is a cute movie, but I have a problem with the way these people render the names of the characters. Anybody who bothers to do any sort of research on the names of the villains will know that their names all are  derived from the French language. Apparently, the people at Pioneer  couldn't find ""peruru"" in their copy of Japanese for Dummies or  whatever they use and they just wrote the literal romanization. For the  sake of informing people the real renditions of the names, I shall list  their names here.
Perle -- [peruru] In the French language, the word  ""perle"" means ""pearl"" in English and the Japanese spell  the French word as ""peruru."" In Kyoto, there is a clothing store  named ""Boutique Perle"" and they spell the ""perle"" part  in Japanese as ""peruru."" The pearl serves as Perle's  characteristic emblem and pearl-like spheres can be seen on his  uniform.
Poupelin -- [pupuran] In France, there is a pastry called  poupelin and they pronounce that name like ""pu-pu-lahn"" like the  Japanese spelling of the name suggests. This gateau, which was popular in  former days, is made by cooking chou paste in a plain round mould. Three-  quarters of the pastry spill outside the mould during cooking, and all that  is left is a sort of outer crust that is filled, once it has cooled, with  chantilly cream, fruit mousse, or ice cream.
Orange -- [oranja] Orange's  name is the French spelling of the English word ""orange."" The  Japanes spell the French word as ""oranja."" Orange is the fairy  who wears the orange motif and becomes a pink bird when fleeing. His name  is obviously derived from the fruit called the orange. An orange refers to  any of several trees of the genus Citrus, widely cultivated in warm regions  and having fragrant white flowers and round fruit with a yellowish or  reddish rind and a sectioned, pulpy interior.
Banane -- [banaanu] Banane  is the French word for the English word ""banana"" and the Japanese  spell the word as ""banaanu."" Banane is the fairy who wears the  banana motif and becomes an orange bird when fleeing. His name is obviously  derived from the banana. These elongated, edible fruits of the plants  belonging to the genus Musa have a thick yellowish to reddish skin and  white, aromatic, seedless pulp.
Bonbon Babies -- [bonbon bebii]  Traditionally authoritative sources such as Hitoshi Doi's site and some of  the different English fansub translations have inadvertently promoted the  ""Bon Bon Baddies"" misconception. Unfortunately, this error is so  old that some fans are likely to question the corrected version. Anybody  who takes the time to study the infant-like nature of these saccharine  enemies will see why they are ""babies."" Bonbons are candies that  often have a center of fondant, fruit, or nuts and are covered with  chocolate of fondant. The name of the candy is a reduplication of the  French word ""bon,"" which means ""good,"" and is from the  Latin word ""bonus.""
Queen of Black Lightning Badiane -- [koku  rai no jo'oo badiyaanu] Badiane, which is the French spelling for star  anise, is a type of exotic spice that is extracted from the star-shaped  fruit of a small evergreen tree native to China. The Japanese plant the  tree in their temples and on tombs. The reddish-brown fruit ripens into a  six or eight pointed star shape. This same star-shape, which the queen  wears on her forehead and on her chest, serves as the her characteristic  emblem.
Massepain Castle -- [majipannu kyassuru] The word  ""massepain"" is the French word for ""marzipan."" The  donut-shaped Massepain Castle is the strangely ornate fortress where  Badiana and her cohorts take the children. Marzipan refers to a confection  made of ground almonds or almond paste, egg whites, and sugar, and it's  often molded into decorative shapes. The alternate spelling,  ""marchpane,"" is closer to the original form of the word, Arabic  ""mawthapan,"" which means ""seated king."" The exact line  of derivation from king to candy is conjectural.
Papillotte --  [papiyotto] The Papillottes are those little pieces of candy that the  fairies throw to become Bonbon Babies. In reality, a papillote refers to a  heavy, greased or oiled paper in which food, especially meat or fish, is  wrapped, cooked and served. The word is derived from the French word  ""papillon"" which means ""butterfly.""",959385600,,4321,4.935933147632312

Sailor Moon Super S has a great sound track and a good  theme.

The  romance was mostly friendship based which was very good...
The movie is  about the bad guy trying to take over the earth through a Black Dream Hole.  Everyone will fall asleep and dream happily...and it will seem like the  earth is dead. Sailor Moon and Chibi Moon destroy this evil together. There  are some more good attacks in this one also...

I was watching this movie when my brother  was having a sleep over and some of the boys came in to watch it and they  really liked it. Instead of having it be all about teenage girls. They  added a younger person, and a boy, to mix up the beat a little. It is good  for both boys and girls, and any good sailor Moon fan should see it.",951177600,,509,3.9607843137254903

Even though she's about Chibi-Usa's age, she's got to be the strongest scout.  But it's good  to have this movie in subtitled, cause when the children are  being taken, they sing are realy neat song in Japanese.  Beleive me, THIS  MOVIE ROCKS!

The third of the movies, it may not be as tear jerking or have such a deep plot or good fighting scenes.  but one thing this one  does have is humor.  A lot of it.  And Sailor Moon humor is something I  live for.  It does have one crude little joke from Neptune to Uranus, which  is utterly hilarious if you know that whole story.  If you are looking for  the same thing you got in the other movies, a better plot or fighting  sequence, this may not be for you.  but if you like a bit of everything and  a surplus of funny jokes, this is the way.  It includes all the senshi,  even Diana (Luna and Artemis's daughter from the future), except Hotaru  (Sailor Saturn) and Chibichibi. I really liked it.",948844800,,790,4.201342281879195

Their entitled to their opinions, but so am I and I don't think they took a close enough lok at this movie. Yes, the plot is a little  childish, but it can keep everyone interested, especially if you're a  Chibi-Usa fan. The comment about being an adult from Sailor Neptune, is  definately one, only older audiences would get (it's pretty funny, you'll  like it). It does have all the Senshi except Saturn, and the starlights,  and the animation is great, much better than the previous two movies. True,  SMS was the best movie, but they are all fantastic, well thought out, and  humorous!",948844800,,676,4.630252100840337
1236156,5,B00000JNTP,Sailor moon superS is my favorite movie of the three(R/S/SuperS) Even though I think Chibu-usa is a little brat I still enjoyed seeing the sailor Senshis(soldiers)use there new attacks  and transformations. The best paert  is when uranus and the outers appear. (outers rock! ^_~),948326400,,279,5.318181818181818

The best part was probably when the outers came  to help the inners. and when Chibi Usa gives Perutu a kiss at the end :)  that was cute. Perutu or whatever has cool wings at the end!

1236158,5,B00000JNTP,"O.K. I've seen all three Sailor Moon movies and this is definately my favorite one! For all of you people out there that live in North America and haven't seen any new Sailor Moon stuff this is the movie for you! It  has all of the scouts (except Saturn ^.^)in their new uniforms and they  have new powers. The movie is centered on Chibimoon,in case you don't like  Chibimoon, but it's still a great movie. One of my favorite parts was when  Usagi asked Mamuro who he loved most, her or Chibi. Well, the movie is  about Peruru, a fairy boy, and how he doesn't want to take little kids and  put them in a dream world. He meets Chibi and he feels, now more than ever,  that kids shouldn't be put into a dream world. Eventually Chibimoon gets  kidnapped and its up to the scouts to save her and the other kids. I won't  tell you how it ends, since it's better to see the movie than me telling  you. I hope you enjoy Sailor Moon SuperS as much as I do.",948067200,,948,4.131147540983607
1236159,4,B00000JNTP,"Although I loved this movie, many people don't like it. Why? Because it revolves around Chibi-Usa, Sailormoon's daughter, who is a bit of a brat. In this movie, Chibi-Usa falls in love with a fairy, and all that cute  stuff...this movie has the romantic aspects of the Sailormoon S movie, and  it has a lot of awesome scenes that made it definitely worth it (Outer  Senshi appearance, and of course the Mamoru dream). I know most young  Sailormoon fans will love it, but the older ones should steer toward the  other two movies. (One last thing: Pupuran is a HOTTIE! ^_^)",947808000,,571,4.6138613861386135
1236160,5,B00000JNTP,"In my opinion SuperS is possibly the best of the three Sailor Moon movies.  Mostly I say this because of the quality of the animation, which is far superior to the other two.  The transformations are quick and done with,  allowing more time for the story to move, and we get to see the inner  soldier's throw their powers without so much as a word (quite cool).  The  appearance of the outer soldiers is great in the context of the film even  though none appeared in the SuperS series.  Peruru is somewhat of an  Elios/Pegasus rip off but it's more than cute hearing Sailor Moon ask him  if he's her boyfriend.  Content for children places this film on the bottom  of the three in my opinion.  It contains spooky imagary of possessed  children and the end shows a more detailed version of nudity (although  still colored sparkles).  My favorite scenes include when all the living  sailor soldiers lend their power to Sailor Moon.  Seeing each planet symbol  on their foreheads is quite cool.

I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE PART WHERE USAGI IS BRAGGING ABOUT HER COOKIES BECAUSE THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL AND MAKING FUN OF CHIBI-USA COOKIES BECAUSE THEY LOOK UGLY. YOU HAVE TO WATCH HOW  USAGI REACTS WHEN SHE ACTUALLY EATS ONE OF HER COOKIES. ANOTHER PART I  REALLY LIKED WAS WHEN CHIBI-USA IS ON HER WAY TO MAMORU'S APARTMENT AND SHE  SPOTS A BOY WITH WINGS, THEN THE WINGS DISPPEAR AND IS HE WEARING A  DIFFERENT OUTFIT. SHE WALKS OVER TO HIM LOOKING AT HIM EVERY WHERE. THE  ONLY BAD PART ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THAT IT WAS REALLY SHORT, IT WAS ONLY AN  HOUR, THEY SHOULD HAD MADE EACH SAILOR MOON MOVIE AT LEAST AN HOUR AND 45  MINUTES.",947030400,,672,4.328
1236163,1,B00000JNTP,"When the movie begins I can swear I'm watching a pop-piper, pinochio rip off.  That music gets on my nerves so much it's slow repeating melody.  I was hoping more from Prelue (Or however you spell it) and stand up for  Chibimoon (Chibiusa) more than he did.  I liked the heartbreack felt by  Usagi when losing her daughter.  I also didn't like the baka balloon  enemies.  Also I felt like I was in a circus the whole movie.  Even the  ending where the witch or whatever blows up in a big ball of energy that  looks like a sun spot it seemed baka.  The dream Usagi had that was suppose  to be the perfect dream sequence was kakoi.  The ending kind of ended  like many movies we've seen before ::think ""Planet of the Apes""  for some strange reason:: O.o;  The best part of this movie was when the  outer senshi had to save the inner senshi, but that was about all you saw  of them.  I was hoping for some of some sort like in the R movie... but I  was left not to find it.  The flying horse was a pretty dumb idea and kind  of done before (trojan horse) and the whole cookie thing was the only thing  the movie had going for itself.

I don't think that the entire storyline about  capturing childrens' dreams for sugar energy is much different from the  plots of the series. It does have some funny parts where Usagi and  Chibi-Usa quarrel, and when Usagi frequently ditzes out. I don't reccommend  this movie over the other two.

I haven't actually seen Pioneer's version(I borrowed my friend's old old one), but if it's anything  like their other translations, it's wonderful! The 3'O Clock Fairy song is  downright infectious and all the grumps who shudder as it plays need to  remember childhood a bit better. ^_- The appereance of Pluto, Uranus, and  Neptune literally made me fall out of my chair(it was the first time seeing  them on tape!), and squeal with delight. I'm not sure if Pioneer translated  the breif humor between Neptune and Uranus, but if they did.. parents  shouldn't worry. I'm almost certain it would go over most children's heads.  All in all, this movie kept me laughing as the jokes just kept coming.  Anyone familiar with only the DiC dub should definatly get this-and the  other two-Sailor Moon movies.

1236190,4,B00000JNTP,"Yes, I know this is the famously dubbed worst of the 3.  However it has some good value points!  Like:  the outers.  They barely said two words in the S movie!  (""Oh no, they interupted our coffe!  And it was such  GOOD coffe.  Guess it's time to fight."")  I swear, they barely said  any more than their transformation words... ^^;;  However in this movie, I  feel they are given more justice, including an awsome attack sequence!  (Gotta love them space sword and mirror!  ^_~*)  So bear through the Chibi  Usa oh-so-sugery cuteness.  Once you take out the sappy stupid parts (like  for me, the entire middle [apartment - confronting Peruru]) seriously, this  is one cool movie.

As with Ranma, all is done in good taste and with  reason, and there should be no problem if as long as you watch with them. I  think some of the fans over-exaggerate.
The Sailors do shed their clothes  during the transformations, but it's nothing they don't see in the TV  series.

Rankings of the movies (which I own already): Sailormoon R:  Quite really the best of all three, the most dramatic and heart-wrenching  Sailormoon S: Good light story ... great to see all the Outer Senshi use  their powers and Luna turn into a Human! Sailormoon Super S: Really very  sweet and saccharine. Great for younger fans who like Chibi-usa. SHows off  different attacks, but the plot line is not original at all.",934070400,,653,4.538461538461538

Great animation (even better than Sailor Stars), really funny scenes, all the Sailor Senshi (except Sailor Saturn), old powers, new powers, it's got everything you'd  want from Usagi and friends. but it!!1",930960000,,262,5.093023255813954

7912990,3,B00000JNTP,"This is the 3rd and final Sailor Moon movie collection tape. The quality is alright, it is VHS the one I bought long time ago, so quality is eh. The story is not my favorite out of the movies Sailor Moon has. Sailor Moon has 3 movies, (Promise of Rose, Hearts in Ice, and Dream Hole). This is Black Dream hole, and it has Sailor moon and her friends trying to save the world from being eaten up by a black hole. There is no big fight at the end, which I felt was not good, because the movies always end with Sailor Moon fighting using the silver crystal in a huge battle, this one was not like that.",1443916800,,599,4.042016806722689

7912997,1,B00000JNTP,"I would never not purchase a Sailor Moon product, even the ones that I don't love the most. That aside, I didn't enjoy this Sailor Moon movie. Mostly, I didn't enjoy the whole Sailor Moon SS season of Sailor Moon. I found the relationship between Serena, Rini, and Darien disturbing and annoying.

I also thought that there wasn't enough emotional pull in the movie, Sailor Moon is known for making you cry in sorrow, or joy, but this movie wasn't that empowering.

Also it was too action packed, it was all about fighting and then some more fighting, and although I am not opposed to action I except more out of a Sailor Moon project. I except emotional pull, romance, tears, and tidbits of the typical teenager's life. I felt ripped off on that front.",1372550400,,753,4.57037037037037
