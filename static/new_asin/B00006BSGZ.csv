1741433,3,B00006BSGZ,"Callas only sings 4 arias on this dvd. This is the reason I gave only 3 stars. But sung of the finest possible voice, better than on other dvds availlable. The rest of it is Tosca complete act 2 and other orchestral pieces. She sings ""Vissi d'arte"", ""Tu che le vanita"" superbly, ""Habanera"" from Carmen and ""Seguedille"" of the same.",1156204800,10,331,4.533333333333333
1741434,5,B00006BSGZ,"This is a conflation of two rare televised appearances of Callas from Covent Garden. The first was filmed in 1962 and Callas is in surprisingly good voice, considering she had almost given up at this time (her only other appearances that year were a series of concerts - no stage appearances at all). The Verdi is sung with a wealth of detail and expression and she acts out all Elisabetta'a emotions vividly, while hardly moving a muscle. Indeed she is so immersed in her singing that when a large brooch she is wearing dislodges and drops to the floor, she barely notices. She then changes completely into a playful, sexy and dangerous Carmen. What a pity she never wanted to sing the role on stage.

The second part of the DVD is a fully staged performance of Act2 of Tosca with Tito Gobbi and Renato Cioni. Why oh why didn't they have the forseight to film the whole thing? Still I guess we should be grateful for what we have. There are faults - the camera work isn't all it should be - but this is surely the most riveting perofrmance of this act ever committed to film. True, Callas was in better voice when she filmed this same Act in Paris a few years previously (some of the top notes are little better than screams), but I have rarely, if ever, seen opera singers act with such naturalness and abandon. Both Callas and Gobbi are superb. You really forget they are singing and end up being totally drawn in to the performance of two actors. In fact I remember that on the days I worked at the English National Opera shop, whenever we played this video when the audience were gathering for that evening's performance, the tiny little shop would quickly fill up with people who couldn't take their eyes off the television screens. Enough said!",1134345600,24,1751,4.523659305993691
1741435,5,B00006BSGZ,The Act Two of Tosca is a very rare and treasured live performance being to my knowledge the only one of Callas live on stage in an opera. Brava! I was very lucky to attend many of her opera performances at the old Met and her Medea at La Scala in 1961. JamesEiler@Prodigy.net,1129939200,11,276,4.226415094339623
1741436,5,B00006BSGZ,"I first heard about this performance (Tosca) nearly 30 years ago when I was a teenager and new to the world of opera. Since then it had stuck in the back of my mind, occasionally being brought intensely to the forefront whenever a snippet of it was shown during the occasional documentary.
Here it is, after three decades, it's going on 2 a.m., and I've had one of the most profound experiences in recorded opera.....whew!
First of all, this is a barebones dvd: Chapter list and some brief but interesting notes in the accompanying liner.
Then there are the performances...Callas in concert at Covent Garden in 1962. ""Tu che la vanit"" from Don Carlos, plus the Habanera and Seguedille from Act 1 of Carmen. Callas sings with the expected intensity in the Verdi, and with atypical jovolity and coyness in the Bizet, which are all ably conducted by the young Georges Prtre. If this were the entire content of this dvd, it would be worth the cost.
But along comes Act 2 of Tosca, from two years later. Holy Toledo! Renato Cioni sings Cavaradossi just adaquetely, and not really serving a whole lot of dramatic purpose with a standard performance. Robert Bowman as Spoletta and Dennis Wicks as Sciaronne are better in their acting, but not very impressive vocally. The conductor, Cillario, leads without much insight...again, standard opera fare.
Obviously, the big bucks went to Callas, Gobbi, and Zeffirelli who all certainly earned their pay. Callas and Gobbi had seen better days vocally, especially Callas who, though in pretty good voice, sounds downright nasty here and there. But those very few exceptions are far and few in between.
Here are two masters, two artists at the very top of their craft, two legendary performers giving a definitive performance of sight and sound. From the beginning of the act, Gobbi dominates with a presence that few could ever hope to do. And when Callas finally enters, the sparks fly. Nearly every gesture, every vocal inflection, every subtle nuance carries weight that cannot be measured. There are very very few moments of stage mannerisms, so complete are their portrayals. While not always pretty vocally, they show off to the world why they dominated the opera stage during their prime. The intensity they create together is incredible, seldom letting up in the cat and mouse game they play.
Technically, the picture is good, but not great. Pretty good by early 60's television standards. The camera work for the most part is well done, save for a few instances of poor angles or exclusionary closeups that can be pretty frustrating. Overall, it is quite good.
Zeffirelli, the ultra conservative, directs a wonderful production,but when you go back in time, you see how little he really changes over the years.
For all it's relatively minor shortcomings, this is one of the greatest operatic moments on film. The earlier clips are priceless, but after a (literally) hair raising Tosca, you may barely remember them! 5 stars to the 10th power! Thank you EMI!",1048204800,76,3002,4.923076923076923
1741437,5,B00006BSGZ,"Of her Met performance of 1964, Rudolf Bing said,""There never was such a Tosca."" After seeing the video of Act 2, I must agree. Every note, every phrase, every movement is perfection. She IS Tosca, and we are  humbled and grateful to have witnessed her performance.",939168000,44,265,4.760869565217392
1741439,5,B00006BSGZ,This is incredible.  A true classic.  Could anybody ever be Scarpia any better than Gobbi or Tosca any better than Callas?  I watch it over and over.,1373068800,,149,4.444444444444445
1741440,5,B00006BSGZ,"The filmed legacy of Callas is very small considering her ranking in the world of opera.  This disc contains just about all we have of her on camera, performing.  But oh what performances!  The CARMEN excerpts tease us to what a CARMEN she would have been!  Rich lustrous tones, a real understanding of the role. And those eyes...real CARMEN eyes.
What can be said of the TOSCA that hasn't been said?  Callas didn't just sing TOSCA, she Was TOSCA!  From her entrance in act 1 to her leap from Castel Sant Angelo in act 3, she was TOSCA.  The act 2 filmed version here lets us not only hear but see what a singing actress she was and is.  Always in character she portrays this tormented woman like no other.  And she has the perfect Scarpia in Tito Gobbi.  He doesn't bluster his way through the role but is very smooth and suave in his lecherous way, squeezing out the information he wants.  Questo en bacio di Tosca, indeed!  It is a kiss from Maria Callas to all of us to remind us of what the greatest opera singer of all time was and is.",1367712000,2,1041,4.282051282051282
1741441,5,B00006BSGZ,Maria Callas is stunning as Tosca. She is Tosca in this production. For music students so much can be leaned by her subtlety.,1321920000,,125,4.478260869565218
1741442,5,B00006BSGZ,"At first, I thought these performances at Covent Garden in black and white would be suitable only for fans of Maria Callas or libraries wanting examples of great opera performances from the 1960s.

To my surprise, the performance of Callas and Tito Gobbi, as Tosca and Scarpia, has become my definitive example of how Tosca should be performed.  It's all here:  great singing coupled with realistic, dramatic acting--and all on a dark and brooding stage that almost lets us smell the blood of Cavaradossi's suffering below.  It's a Tosca for the ages!",1272844800,2,551,4.956521739130435
1741443,5,B00006BSGZ,"The 1962 appearance is more like the best of.  We hear:
Verdi: Don Carlo (Atto IV) Tu che le vanita
Bizet: Carman
Prelude
Jabanera (Acte I)
Entr'acte (Acte III)
Sguedille (Acte I)

Watching Maria adds a detention missed in

Puccini's Tosca (alto II), 1964 will hold your attention; however I am glad that there are subtitles as I only knew the story form secondary sources. Dennis Wicks as Sciarrone looks like Arty Johnson. This is a long scene however it is not the complete story.  So as with the 1962 section this is the best of.

The advantage to this recording is that there are no commercials it gets down to business. The disadvantage is the recording is not well focused.

Be sure to obtain the RMI classics CD's of Callas so you can carry her with you.",1257206400,,762,4.4855072463768115
1741444,5,B00006BSGZ,"I give 5 stars to this DVD for the 1964 Tosca's place in La Divina's history.  You just must have it!  When you watch it, you will wish you had a DVD of Callas and Gobbi in the entire opera; but you will rejoice that you have even these bits.

At age 41, Callas managed to transform herself into this almost-virginal Tosca, and she is awesome!  She completely subjects her voice to being Tosca.  She infuses incredible pathos and agony most raw into that voice while still doing justice to the music.  That's why she was La Divina.

I personally love Tito Gobbi!  But, even if I didn't, his Scarpia is a visual and aural treat.  While a little long in the tooth, in 1964 Gobbi was still a powerful actor and singer.  His Scarpia is one thousand percent despicable!

Unlike other reviewers, for me the 1962 material is harder to discuss.  This was a difficult time for Callas as a singer.  I want to love it for her and the music; but there we are.  To me, she appears and sounds pressed on a number of fronts.  By 1964, she seemed in better shape.

The package EMI provides us is a disappointment, to say the least.  The notes are scanty and difficult to read.  Tiny gold print on black (!!!!!!) for the first page.  Not much better for the second page--tiny black print on gold.  EMI, what WERE you thinking????",1251849600,3,1312,4.365145228215767
1741445,5,B00006BSGZ,"I give this DVD five stars because no one sang Carmen or Tosca like Maria Callas and this DVD shows us exactly why. On the other hand, fans looking for a great performance of the entire opera of Tosca should look to her '53 recording with DiStefano and Gobbi, conducted by Victor DeSabata. This doesn't come close. And that is saying a lot because this is pretty good. The problem is Carlo Felice Cillario's conducting isn't great and the acting by everyone other than Callas and Gobbi (who are phenomenal) is sub-par.

The 1962 aria portion is great even with Georges Pretre's sillyness at the podium. Maria sings ""Tu che la Vanita"" from Don Carlo, then the ""Habanera"" and ""Seguidille"" from Carmen. Pretre's treatment of other scores and his goofball antics aside, I think it's beyond argument that he knew what he was doing as far as Carmen. The same goes for Callas who is the epitome of Carmen.",1241913600,,898,4.647798742138365
1741446,3,B00006BSGZ,"The disc is OK - but the sound leaves something to be desired. However, I have a tape of the same concert and the sound is equally poor, so we have to blame the old-fashioned technology. However, by the time you have paid for postage and packing and then customs and VAT, the discs are very expensive.",1213228800,,301,4.298245614035087
1741447,5,B00006BSGZ,Excellent.  Makes me cry everytime I watch her.  She is the benchmark for all opera singers.  Get it!!!!,1184284800,11,104,4.666666666666667
1741448,5,B00006BSGZ,"EMI released a real treasure with this DVD. You can read a lot about it, but go straight to Tosca's Act II track and you will feel the same excitement, I wonder, Ludwig Borchardt when unearthed Nefertiti's bust in 1912.

A priceless moment among the most famous performances in opera history, here preserved complete. If I were an opera singer or student, this DVD will be among my essentials: just look at Callas and Gobbi's faces, gestures (the slight and perverted touch of the feather in Callas hand, by Gobbi) and movements (both circling around Scarpia's table, like predator and victim). That's what opera is meant to be!",1177200000,12,628,4.814814814814815

7966820,5,B00006BSGZ,"It is an amazing example of her extraordinary talent and dedication to music. It is too bad that it is only in black and white but it is a treasure to own for life. I do not know any better Tosca, and certainly not Birgit Nillson, even who had a fabulous voice but no really acting skills!
The voice is, for 1962/1964, in a great health!
Also I love to see her in Carmen. Her French is much better than most French singers with absolutely no mistakes!
I do recommend it as something rarely seen and heard!",1424563200,2,505,4.216494845360825

7966822,3,B00006BSGZ,I would have preferred to have seen more of her work in operas.  There was just a snippet from Tosca.  I'm not complaining; just a bit disappointed.,1406678400,,148,4.444444444444445
7966823,1,B00006BSGZ,"I bought this because it is one of the few recordings with an excerpt of Tito Gobbi singing Scarpia's role in ""Tosca,"" amongst
other arias, together with Maria Callas's Tosca. Imagine my disappointment when a 70 minute disc turned out to be 25 minutes
long and the last nearly 2 minutes consisted of applause. No Tosca. The technical quality of the other 23 minutes was not stellar (Don Carlo, Carmen) but I was prepared to overlook that. I can't overlook false advertising and more than half of the DVD missing.",1388361600,,512,4.7

7966825,5,B00006BSGZ,A legendary performance for good reason.  Callas and Gobbi make great drama out of what is often a static art.,1386720000,,110,4.5
7966826,2,B00006BSGZ,"There are so many positive reviews of this video, it must be attractive in some way to people who already love Callas. I am sure they know who they are and don't need a review of any kind. This is for all the others.

I have neither been a Callas fan nor a detractor, just have a few of her popular commercial sets (Lucia, Gioconda, Traviata, maybe a few others). And they are OK, but I have never quite understood the hype, only having heard my mom (Callas' age, with no interest in opera) go on about how everyone felt so sorry for her because of ... etc.

So I came to this video with an open mind, maybe even looking to be converted. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. Honestly, it's the most self-indulgent mass or mess of glitter and overacting I've ever had to suffer through. What Callas does with this material makes any Liberace appearance look like a model of good taste and restraint in comparison. And there's one other small problem, it's her voice. Completely aside from her external gestures, it's unattractive and out of control.

And now a very small footnote concerning the conductor Georges Pretre, whom I had always respected and admired. But here he puts on some kind of Bugs Bunny impersonation, making strange poses and mugging the camera, conducting like a clown. I can't tell if he's trying to make fun of Callas, or just joining in with the general zaniness of the whole show.

But my, my, how the crowd roars with applause after each appalling number, and how the camera captures the roaring, so who am I to have an opinion?

My review is that the DVD was a complete waste (theft) of money and time, but I suppose I am grateful at least for historical accuracy. But I still prefer the hidden, mysterious, unknown Callas that I have been guardedly admiring for 30 years.",1386547200,,1791,4.498461538461538
7966827,5,B00006BSGZ,"Maria Callas, the incomparable one. This DVD gives us a glimpse of her greatness.as a stunning soprano, gifted actress, with a remarkable ability to interpret her role and convey her deep-felt interpretation to her audience in a spellbound way. She is the complete package. She has no equal.

This is a must-have recording.",1384819200,,323,5.09433962264151
