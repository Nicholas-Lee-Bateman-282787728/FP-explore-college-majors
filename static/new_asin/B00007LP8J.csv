1820262,5,B00007LP8J,"This is simply one of the best (and most realistic) baseball movies ever, and I've seen them all.",1181865600,2,97,4.444444444444445
1820263,4,B00007LP8J,This movie is about a baseball scout who finds a player at the last minute just before he is released by the new owner of the team. It sets in play an excellent story line and viewers get to see another side of the game. Excellent video.,1175644800,2,237,4.0638297872340425
1820264,5,B00007LP8J,Loved this movie! Eddie is in his element; this movie will leave you cheering on the edge of your seat. Both Eddie and director Robert M. Young are magical.,1175040000,,156,4.413793103448276
1820265,5,B00007LP8J,"Not your typical Baseball movie. Very realistic right up until you get to the owner letting a rookie start(but that is probably a realism if it was to actually happen). Anyone who is a fan of Olmos will not be disappointed and see another side of him. This man is a real talent and Lorraine Brocco is as attractive as ever, another real talent there.",1173052800,,350,4.4
1820266,5,B00007LP8J,"I love the movie because it was made in the small town where I grew up.  They gave the baseball field a makeover and everything for us.  When Edward James Olmos was there he let the kids sit on his lap and gave me a kiss!  How sweet!  It really depicts our town and I love the movie because of that.  When I'm homesick I look back at it and remember Genesee,ID.  That is why I'm buying it now!  The movie is not fabulous, but it is a great family movie.",1136073600,2,453,3.912087912087912
1820267,4,B00007LP8J,"a very good, very underrated movie about a pitching scout, who help a young pitching ace realize his dream of making the big leagues.the casting is wonderful.a loving ode to baseball. get it !",973987200,5,192,4.676470588235294
1820268,5,B00007LP8J,"I personnally enjoyed this movie very much. It was nice seeing the actor who plays Virgil Sweet involved in something after Miami Vice. If you see this in the rental stores, do not pass this one up!",912038400,4,198,4.378378378378378
1820289,2,B00007LP8J,"Pros: The film is about Sweets romance with baseball and Bobbie. In both cases, I believed in his passion. The film looked and sounded good, including the baseball scenes. It was well-paced. Cons: Almost all of the characters, except Sweet and Bobbie, are flat, one-dimensional, and sometimes cartoonish characters. A pitch for the ordination of women comes out of left field and doesnt seem to fit the character who makes it. Like in The Scout, another baseball movie, the closing act is ridiculously implausible. There seems to be no point to the story. The closing coda makes the phenom seem as crass as the villainous owner. Warning: the film does include a significant amount of profanity and vulgar language.",1448064000,,714,5.008403361344538
1820290,4,B00007LP8J,Solid feel good film. Good if you follow baseball but probably just OK if you don't. I still don't see how someone could only give it one star though.,1444435200,,150,4.206896551724138
1820291,5,B00007LP8J,Great,1441411200,,5,5.0
1820292,5,B00007LP8J,"A simple but excellent ""feel-good"" movie. Even if you don't like baseball, you'll like this movie.  Superbly paced.  Doesn't have any superfluous scenes in it.",1439596800,,159,5.32

1820296,5,B00007LP8J,Great movie!,1434585600,,12,5.5
1820297,5,B00007LP8J,I just absolutely love this movie.  The young kid comes into the game of baseball very naive but quickly becomes a shrewd businessman.  The scout becomes his best friend whom he trusts with all of heart.  You want to think that the pitcher went on to win 30 plus games the next year and won the world series and the cy young award.  The scout and his girlfriend get married in the middle of a game with the pitcher as the best man.  I just love this movie.  Everyone should see this.,1427155200,,483,4.195652173913044
1820298,4,B00007LP8J,very nice feel good story,1426723200,,25,4.2
1820299,5,B00007LP8J,what a great baseball movie about a scout looking for that one star to keep his job .,1421020800,,85,3.7777777777777777
1820300,3,B00007LP8J,"Not the best movie in the world, but a must have for a baseball movie collection",1407283200,,80,4.0625

1820302,5,B00007LP8J,You must see this wonderfully told story about baseball and its roots in America's farms and fields and how it truly is America's game,1402531200,,134,4.625
1820303,4,B00007LP8J,Great Baseball movie and very entertaining. Edward James O. and Lorainne B were very good in this movie. I recommend to baseball fans.,1393545600,,134,4.869565217391305
1820304,5,B00007LP8J,I found the movie very good.  Olmos is a great actor and I haven't found any movie that he has made bad.,1392249600,,104,3.727272727272727
1820305,3,B00007LP8J,"Edward Olmos and Lorraine Bracco make such a great couple.  Together they make the movie.
The movie starts out much better than it ends.",1386892800,,136,4.666666666666667
1820306,5,B00007LP8J,"This movie is an inspiration to all people with a dream. This was plays well on DVD. Also, the picture quality and audio was good.",1377561600,,130,4.24
1820307,4,B00007LP8J,I enjoyed the movie mainly because it's a feel-good story and I like Edward James Olmos.  It's a good baseball story.,1370995200,,117,4.571428571428571
1820308,5,B00007LP8J,The life of a scout on the road. How he picks the good from not as good. Good songs played also.,1367712000,,96,3.619047619047619
1820319,5,B00007LP8J,"A great movie, with great acting! Guarantee, you'll love it.  Mr. Olomos did an excellent job . . . .",1362355200,,101,4.05
1820320,5,B00007LP8J,Great job!!!! I am so thankful for the service I provided and I will look for you again when I want more movies.,1360454400,,112,3.9130434782608696
1820321,5,B00007LP8J,If you are a James Almos fan this is a must movie for you collection. He does a fantastic acting job and it's a very good story.,1301356800,,128,3.7777777777777777
1820322,5,B00007LP8J,I saw this movie a few years back and loved it. The character development is great and the story is wonderful. I just bought it on DVD and will watch it often.,1283385600,,159,4.0
1820323,5,B00007LP8J,This was a very good inspiring movie with a comic twist of country boy bests a team owner who tried to take advantage of him.  Great for all ages.,1264809600,,146,4.0344827586206895
1820324,1,B00007LP8J,"Simple:  I can't remember a worse baseball movie. The ballgame at the end contains a twist so improbable that I thought I had fallen into a Disney cartoon. Poorly written and a waste of a top shelf talent in Olmos.  Get this one only if you want to howl at all the cliches, or see it with a bunch of friends and make someone drink some, uh, Koolade whenever Olmos says, ""Kid."" Sugar rush guaranteed.",1250812800,,399,4.306666666666667
1820325,5,B00007LP8J,an outstanding family film. good story.  not sure if it was ever released to theaters and not sure what the critics said (and frankly don't care).  It was a great story.,1232323200,,169,4.419354838709677
1820326,5,B00007LP8J,"Even though this movie did not win everyone's heart ( and I understand),this was a good baseball movie about overcoming the odds. A fine cast with Edward James Olmos as a baseball scout in search of a player from the fields of Idaho to help the stuggling California (now L.A. Angels of Anaheim) Angels. One thing that made me wonder in the closing minutes of the movie. The Angels were down but the movie never mentioned if the Angels won their game over the Royals! It's a mystery! Anyway I thought it was a good movie worth watching!",1217980800,,535,4.469387755102041
1820327,1,B00007LP8J,"In spite of a talented cast, this movie is pretty poor, I couldn't even watch it the whole way, and I love baseball movies.  That might be part of it, if you know any thing about baseball, important parts of the plot are just too fantastic, too illogical, too incredulous to accept, even for a couple of hours while watching a movie.  The lines are so poor even Almos, one of the most talented actors of his time, is unable to sound convincing (he says ""son"" so often he'll actually get on your nerves).  Bracco and Almos don't pull off the couple in love, and the pitcher is poorly casted, he doesn't look like an ""Idaho farm boy,"" he looks as old as the other players, and his dumbfounded look, meant to accentuate his innocence, will also begin to grate quickly.  If you love Edward Almos, go get ""Stand and Deliver,"" a true story masterpiece, and posssibly the acme of his acting career, but you never know with him.  If you like Bracco, she's better in virtually every other movie (though it is funny that in this movie she has a master's in psychology, and she goes on to become Tony Soprano's shrink), I really liked her live when she did Mrs. Robinson, ""The Graduate"" on stage.  If you're looking for a sad baseball movie, try ""Bang the Drum Slowly,""  if you're looking for a ""Dying breed"" themed baseball movie, try ""Bull Durham,"" if you want a funny baseball movie I'd suggest ""Mr. Baseball,""  or ""Major League,"" or if you want a family baseball movie with a deeper message, ""In a League of their Own,"" or ""61.""",1212451200,,1521,4.465703971119134
1820328,2,B00007LP8J,"Edward James Olmos is a great actor. He is the only reason that I gave this movie even a '2 rating'.

This was a very disappointing, far from memorable movie. I will probably pass it on to one of my grandsons who likes baseball.

I found this movie to be boring and predictable.",1206748800,,278,4.226415094339623
7978126,4,B00007LP8J,"A very good baseball movie starring one of my favorite actors, Edward James Olmos (Battlestar Gallactica, Two Guns).  A little corny at times, but very touching.  The life of a baseball scout is shown as what it is, many long days on the road looking for that special talent that is one in a million.  They must really love what they do to put themselves through that kind of road life.",1518393600,,386,4.408450704225352

7978128,4,B00007LP8J,Very nice.  Good for underdog baseball fans. Ending pushes it a bit (understatement) but fun and inspiring and no blood/death.,1509062400,,126,5.3
7978129,5,B00007LP8J,"Love baseball.  Enjoyed the movie.  In a world dominated by electronics now and access at your fingertips, was nice to travel back in time to see how scouts found prospects.",1492387200,,173,4.733333333333333
