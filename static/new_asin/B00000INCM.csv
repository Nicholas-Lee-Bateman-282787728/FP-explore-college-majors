1224344,2,B00000INCM,The song and dance numbers cannot rescue this musical from the silly plot and weak characters.  The film goes nowhere.  I found it hard to identify with the characters and thus very hard to watch.  Perhaps a disk that had only the songs and the dances?,1323302400,,252,4.434782608695652
1224345,4,B00000INCM,"A very enjoyable minor movie musical. I do not intend to do a full review  - instead I would like to make a few comments.

First, contrary to what the previous reviewer wrote, the clever lyricist who wrote ""I'll take Manhattan/The Bronx and Staten...Island"" was not Sammy Cahn but Lorenz Hart (in the early days of his collaboration with Richard Rodgers).

""Two Tickets To Broadway"" is interesting as it contains a rare screen performance by the vaudeville comedy duo Smith & Dale. While they are reasonably humorous, their interest to modern viewers would be that they were the act that Neil Simon based his Sunshine Boys on - a comedy team who worked well together but actually hated each other offstage.

Finally, I'm not sure I go along with the description of Tony Martin as ""bland"". In real life, he married Cyd Charisse and stayed married to her for many years. Any guy who can keep one of the world's most beautiful women happy for that long must have something going for him!",1106524800,15,984,4.670520231213873
1224346,4,B00000INCM,"With a story by Sammy Cahn, this is a typical story of a small town girl going to Broadway to make it big. Initially she gets ripped off by a lovable rogue agent, played with great comedy by Eddie Bracken. Janet Leigh's character teams up with aspiring singer Dan and the crux of the movie is whether they will get their big break and whether (of course) they will fall in love!
Unlike many of its contemporaries, this musical features none of the huge stars of the day such as Howard Keel or Doris Day, but what must have been considered a second rank of musical performers. To give you an idea, the guest star is not Bing but Bob Crosby! That said, Janet Leigh (who would later become a much bigger name) acquits herself well in the singing and dancing, and as we know, she's a fine actress. Tony Martin is so-so as the leading man, but has a fine baritone and can dance reasonably well.
The stand out song is I'll Take Manhattan with that classic Cahn rhyming of Manhattan with 'the Bronx & Staten...island'.The colourful costumes the girls wear in the Busby Berkeley choreographed dance make this a first rate number.",1019779200,18,1121,4.5
1224347,5,B00000INCM,"I highly recommend this musical.  It has everything, romance, comedy, and dance.  Also some great singing.  Janet Leigh and Tony Martin make a great couple in this film.",1018742400,6,169,4.964285714285714
7910932,5,B00000INCM,"I'm adding a review to the other words of praise for this often overlooked gem among big-budget, full-color Hollywood musicals, mainly because I want to emphasize the fun of seeing Bob Crosby play a major part later in the movie.

Bob had a significant career of his own and was highly respected as a bandleader with a commitment to big-band jazz. He made early appearances on TV and actually had his own variety show in the mid 1950s. The central goal of the wannabe actresses and actors in this film is an appearance on network TV on Bob Crosby's show. When they finally get inside his TV studio, Bob and his band have a lot of fun with his celebrity in comparison to his more famous brother. That's really the most delightful segment of this film, we found.

If you want to see Bob performing in this era in another great musical, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Presenting-Lily-Mars/dp/B00EOBB6R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Presenting Lily Mars</a>, which we also saw recently and can highly recommend. Bob doesn't get as much of a spotlight in that movie, however.

It's also fun to see Janet Leigh exercise her musical skills. Today, moviegoers who are familiar with her career mostly think of her star turn (and death) in Hitchcock's Psychoor perhaps they've seen her costarring with Tony Curtis or maybe in the highly praised classic Touch of Evil. Leigh was multiply talented, including as an author, and it's nice to see her signing and dancing in her prime in this movie.",1496793600,,1529,5.108
7910933,5,B00000INCM,I lived through this period of musicals. Loved them than and love them now.,1496275200,,75,4.428571428571429
7910934,3,B00000INCM,"Howard Hughes's line up of acts is basically his way of responding to the other studios' efforts to do the same thing. There are echoes of the Garland/Rooney cycle of musicals from MGM, with a spice of Fox glitz and the good ol' feelin' of well-being from Warners' Doris Day vehicles of a similar period.

The only snag is that Hughes did really have any big stars on his payroll. What TWO TICKETS TO Broadway presents is a panoply of would-be leading lights, youngsters on their way to stardom, and imitations of more famous originals such as Bob Crosby who does a specialty number with a cardboard cutout of his more illustrious sibling Bing.

Having said that, some of the cast give winning turns. The triumvirate of Janet Leigh, Ann Miller and Gloria DeHaven adumbrate a similar conception in Fox's GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES (1953); and they acquit themselves thoroughly well in the song and dance sequences, with Miller getting the chance to show off her famed legs. Tony Martin croons his way through one or two numbers, to the delights of hordes of adoring bobbysoxers. Eddie Bracken camps it up in a largely extraneous comedy role.

Yet perhaps the most interesting aspect of James V. Kern's all-star line-up is its inherent structural contradiction that tells us a lot about the contradictions of movie capitalism at the time. The film begins in Garland/ Rooney fashion by suggesting that, given time and talent, anyone can make it big so long as they have the drive and energy to do so, even if they originate from small-town and America and have to travel to New York by Greyhound bus. This is precisely what Leigh, DeHaven and Miller try to do.

Yet once they get there, they find that they are very much at the agents' and radio program-makers' mercy. They have to alter their work to suit specific formats, and compromise at every opportunity in line with their employers' requirements. We wonder at this point whether Broadway - like Hollywood - actually values originality, or whether or not both institutions would be much happier with carbon copies of tried and tested formulas.

The film does not attempt to answer the question, of course (why should it, when it was planned as a joyful musical), but it reveals an undercurrent of cynicism about the potentially adverse effects of money-making and success.",1473552000,,2324,4.843828715365239
7910935,3,B00000INCM,"Usually Dan Dailey, Virginia Mayo or June Haver starred in the non-Metro B-musicals of the postwar decade. This is an intriguing and undistinguished exception, with a large contingent of quality Metro talent guiltily playing hooky for Howard Hughes at RKO. Martin, Leigh, Miller and De Haven (so too dance director Busby Berkeley) all had recent Metro creds, and Hughes was keen to push (literally) his currently contracted ingenue Miss Leigh into revealingly tight sweaters and to reinvent her as a musical-comedy star. (Janet unfailingly knew her own strengths, and went on after Hughes to popular success in MY SISTER EILEEN and BYE BYE BIRDIE.)

Miss Leigh notwithstanding, the uncredited or ghost talent here is more interesting than what actually hits the screen in RKO's slightly screwy and unnatural Technicolor. Jerry Wald and Norman Krasna nominally produced, yet Hughes' interference permeates every frame. The forgettable script was originated by the great songwriter Sammy Cahn, and the invisible direction by James V. Kern is entirely secondary to the Berkeley dance routines. Jule Styne from Broadway and Leo Robin from Hollywood wrote the new songs, but absent the goofily grinning Dan Dailey the real highlight here is Tony Martin, first-billed in a loanout starring role, crooning his interpolated romantic smash ""There's no tomorrow"" and even the PAGLIACCI prologue (now that's my idea of ""putting on a show"").

Ann Miller, Janet Leigh and Tony Martin (check out his roguish Universal programmer CASBAH) are perpetually welcome on my home screen, although here Bracken, De Haven, the aerialists and dreary comedy team are party poopers and make the RKO show far less sparkling than it could have been. Recall that RKO was the artistic creative base for the Astaire-Rogers musicals, and reflect that even in 1951 the Hollywood moguls genuinely feared the threat of the pernicious television medium, sent up irreverently in this and other period musicals. The unfamiliar new medium was more threatening even than the dire blacklist, and Hughes was hardly exceptional in importing this large block of expensive talent, and then quite blithely throwing that investment away. Metro was rather preoccupied with their humbler projects (AMERICAN IN PARIS, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN) at this time, and in grooming fresh young singing hoofers, so I'm loath to judge these truant talents--incidentally earning huge loanout fees from an impoverished RKO--too harshly.

Martin, Leigh and Miller followers (and Berkeley completists) won't be entirely disappointed here--it's great fun to see them doing the Ferris Bueller thing--and for a completely scabrous, shameless and idiomatic Hughes musical, viewers should check out the 1954 FRENCH LINE, incomparably raunchy as a production-number showcase for Miss Jane Russell, no truant in her home studio.",1464739200,,2851,5.4457013574660635
7910936,5,B00000INCM,"1951 saw the release of this RKO musical. Ann Miller does her usual terrific work. Look for George Nader in a small part.  His great good looks and voice make him instantly recognizable  as Charlie. Enjoyed by me also as an early film of Mamie Van Doren in a bit part. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her stand on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.

7910939,4,B00000INCM,"This 1951 musical, a tribute to the early days of TV, was co-produced by Howard Hughes for RKO Pictures.  It features many selections from The Great American Songbook, by various composers (Rodgers and Hart, Jule Styne, and Sammy Cahn, among others).  Tony Martin, better known to some as Mr. Cyd Charisse, is the leading man and has an excellent voice; his hit ""There's No Tomorrow,"" which is featured in the movie, is based on the Neapolitan song ""O Sole Mio,"" and inspired Elvis Presley to record his own version, in 1960, called ""It's Now Or Never.""  Janet Leigh, the leading lady, is a surprisingly good singer and dancer; Jamie Lee and Kelly Curtis' mom was a very versatile actress, and more than just the shower murder victim in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783225849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho (Collector's Edition)</a>.

The other major players in the movie are bandleader Bob Crosby, who does an hilarious number where he pokes fun at brother Bing; Gloria DeHaven, Barbara Lawrence, vaudeville comics Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who play bickering deli owners; comedian Eddie Bracken, and, of course, Ann Miller, who does one of her terrific tap routines to ""The Worry Bird.""  Busby Berkeley, genius that he is, choreographed that number, and all of the dances in the movie.

Although Annie was loaned out from MGM, this movie marked her return to RKO, the studio where she began her movie career, in 1937, at age 14 (though she lied about her age, and pretended that she was 16).

Overall, while not perfect, this is a very entertaining Technicolor movie musical.",1362355200,,1659,5.357692307692307
