Time flies and I get to travel the world in my own home!!' I bought this as a download, but it is still the best!'m",1424044800,5,290,3.85

5467467,5,B00APZUPJ6,I would give this ten stars if I could. I felt was really walking in Rome! The hour on the treadmill just flew by. I got a great workout and a trip to Rome.,1400544000,2,156,3.6176470588235294
5467468,4,B00APZUPJ6,This video has good visual effects. It seems like you are in Rome walking around the city. It makes walking on the treadmill a lot less boring.,1393718400,3,143,4.333333333333333

8555852,3,B00APZUPJ6,"Pros, better than the cotswalds, a better attempt at moving naturally, deleted scenes are the best. a few more panoramic views.

cons,
very slow, 2.1 miles and hour
too many long wall walks, extremely boring, the palatine hill section is the worst, and no fast forward scene selection.  We circle the Colosseum looking at steel fencing, a lot of brick and steel fencing.
The walker must be a man, goal oriented, not at all entertainment oriented, we never get to see art, shops, anything but wall and bricks.
He runs people off the road, path, is extremely rude, you can hear locals saying, ""rude tourist""

no scene selection, i now get off during the paltine hill section, I just get too annoyed.
the crew does not know Rome, and it shows, illogical routes,
I may buy one more and hope the editors do a  better job.  I am ready to buy my own ticket and make my own lol.",1461801600,7,870,4.446540880503145

8555854,3,B00APZUPJ6,Hard to keep a good rhythm  is geared more towards a bike rider. The scenery is beautiful,1451347200,,89,4.235294117647059

8555856,5,B00APZUPJ6,"I love this video.  Vita Digital offers excellent videos.  The recording is excellent, and doing excercise seeing the beautiful sights promotes wellbeing.  I use it with treadmill, and also for stationary indoor walk.  I use my fitbit, and walk 10,000 steps during the video, and time flies, it feels great to do excersise while enjoying the beautiful sights.",1446768000,2,359,5.137931034482759
8555857,4,B00APZUPJ6,"What a great video!  I watch this over and over when I'm on the treadmill.  My only issue is that I would like this in High Def but the resolution is better than most ""walking tour"" videos I've seen.  VITA does a great job.",1444521600,2,223,4.0227272727272725
8555858,5,B00APZUPJ6,A wonderful walking video.  So much to see and perfect for treadmill boredom.,1434585600,,77,4.923076923076923
8555859,5,B00APZUPJ6,"Great little way to pass the time on a treadmill.  If it gets me to use it more, it's worth it.  Glad I got them.",1433030400,4,113,3.48
