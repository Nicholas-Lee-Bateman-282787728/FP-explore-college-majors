1898981,4,B00009Y3RE,"First off,I am very happy any of The Outer Limits original series saw the light of day on DVD.I still to this day have fond memories of coming home from JR. High,making something to eat and catching The Outer Limits on channel 9 on a rainy afternoon. I will state my praises first. These second season episodes look very snazzy as far as the video quality goes. My fave episode ""Demon With A Glass Hand"" is very sharp and clear on my TV.I can now give away my VHS copy. I haven't watched every episode yet but I am figuring they all are pretty good visually. That being said,what kept this review from getting a five star rating is the price and lack of ANYTHING extra. I paid $52.99 for this set and for only 3 DVDs that is alittle steep to me. Another reviewer mentioned the inclusion of the original unused pilot episode of ""Please Stand By"" (the series original name before it changed it's name to The Outer Limits) as an extra treat and I totally agree. Or even a few episodes with running commentaries would have been awesome. But as I stated earlier just to own these oldies but goodies on DVD is well worth it to me.
Cheers,
Steve",1063670400,8,1138,4.347417840375587
1898982,5,B00009Y3RE,"Thanks for preserving this sci-fi classic from the 60's and making it available on the superior DVD format. The episodes look and sound great.

If you are familiar with ""The Outer Limits"" (the original series), you already know why it's special. If you are not, buy this DVD collection, insert disc 2 and watch ""The Inheritors"" starring Robert Duval and Steve Ihnat. See what Hollywood was capable of producing (in black and white and even with primitive special effects) at one time in history and, sadly, how far the entertainment industry has fallen.",1063065600,,553,4.946236559139785
1898983,5,B00009Y3RE,"The Outer Limits was a landmark series worth remembering. I recently purchased the 2nd season series after viewing the 1st season. Although the 2nd season was only considered ""half"" a season, it is well worth mentioning. OUTER LIMITS is the baby brother of THE TWILIGHT ZONE but deserves recognition in its own right.
The only criticism I had with volume 1 is that it was copied on double sided disks and I had problems with them. But after three tries, I finally got a set of disks with no problems. I hope the second season will be just as good.
I would like to thank MGM for keeping this original series alive by selling it on DVD.
I have four children at home who have seen the original series and still find them enjoyable to watch even though the special effects are truly substandard. Its the STORIES that count. Yes, some stories are not up to par, but the same holds for any series. THE ORIGINAL OUTER LIMITS was a great attempt at bringing sciencefiction to television by standards of the 1960s.
The second season of OL was cancelled mid-season because of its being scheduled against THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW (which I really enjoy) but that was a network decision. It should not be the deciding factor about the quality of the show itself.
OL was a series that brought something new to television and suceeded in a spectacular way. If not, people would not even have remembered its name after all these years.
I will always treasure this series and think of it as one of the all-time best series that came out for television.",1062720000,16,1534,4.561594202898551
1898984,4,B00009Y3RE,"Let's see - almost the same price for 32 of the best Season One episodes as they are charging for just 17 of the Season Two shows, which everyone knows are generally not up to par with the first. I half expected SOME sort of extras for the high price. Maybe the pilot episode, 'cause it wouldn't have fit on the first package. Maybe some interviews or behind-the-scenes stuff. Nothing - but the high price! Some of my favorite episodes are in this season (Demon with a glass hand, The Inheritors - damn, I even love the Eddie Albert vehicle Cry of Silence), but this was an out-and-out rip compared to the value of the first season. Shame on MGM!",1062720000,8,646,4.391666666666667
1898985,3,B00009Y3RE,"The second season of The Outer Limits featured some of the finest episodes of the series and also some of the worst; Harlan Ellison's Demon With A Glass Hand and his compromised Solider were two strong highlights. With the departure of Joseph Stefano, the original vision of Stefano and creator/producer Leslie Stevens slipped and the series became host to increasingly absurd premises.
Ellison's two episodes make this second set worth picking up. Demon With A Glass Hand features a brilliant performance by Robert Culp. Culp plays a character who has no memory of who he is. Wandering the streets of an unnamed city, he is attacked by a humanoid alien. He discovers that he is the last survivor of humanity from the future. Oh, and Trent (Culp)has a distinguishing feature that would be hard to miss--he has a computer attached to him shaped like his forearm and hand. Evidently the missing fingers will provide the clues he needs to defeat these aliens chasing him from the future. There's one catch; the aliens have the remaining fingers which have much of the computer's memory.
Solider (which, along with The first season classic The Man Who Was Never Born and Ellison's Demon With a Glass Hand became the inspiration for James Cameron's The Terminator)concerns a solider (marvelously played by Michael Ansara) bred for fighting from the future who is flung into the 20th Century through an accident. He knows that his enemy is pursuing him but that's all; he has no knowledge of history much less how to interact with other humans. His orders are often relayed to him via dogs. All he knows is pain, fighting and killing. He's taken in and observed by a family one of whom is a psychologist trying to help him adjust to his environment. Still, he knows that his enemy is waiting to come and kill him.
Other interesting (although not completely successful) episodes includes The Duplicate Man but nothing else (outside of Ellison's two episodes) quite as compelling as the two parter The Inheritors (which suggested that the series could offer much more character depth with two part episodes). Robert Duvall heads a stunning cast of adults and children in a tale of a group of people who suddenly have extraordinary abilities in science. These individuals had no history of these talents before and all have something that has been implanted in their brains. Who's done this and why are they recruiting physically hanidcapped children is a mystery Duvall must solve.
In Wolf 359 (which shares a plot similar to a Theodore Sturgeon short story) a scientist builds a world in miniature and tinkers with its evolution creating life. After introducing human DNA, he expects the planet to evolve life similar to our own. Needless to say, he's quite mistaken. I Robot was later remade for the revival of The Outer Limits. It's most notable for a brief appearence by Leonard Nimoy as a reporter. The premise of the script is solid but is undone by mundane direction and a compromised teleplay. A Robot's creator is killed. Was it an accident or did the robot murder his ""father""? Producer Ben Brady probably found the script appealing because it has elements of Perry Mason grafted to a science fiction storyline. A trial commences as to whether the robot is guilty of murder. If found guilty, he will be disassembled; essentially he'll be put to death for his crime.
There were other episodes that offered much promise (such as Cold Hands, Warm Heart starring William Shatner and The Invisible Enemy written by the talented Jerry Sohl)but failed to deliver because of budget restrictions and the turnover of the production staff. Still, there were a number of fine episodes produced and at least four of these episodes matched or surpassed the best from the first season. There was a distinctive shift after the departure of Stefano and Stevens from the gothic science fiction stories (which, again, impacted films like Blade Runner and The Terminator in terms of atmosphere). The series final episode featured first season actor Mark Richman with a clever conceit; what if a probe came to Earth and took away what it deemed a sample of life? What if that sample happened to be human? It's well structured but the low budget undermines the look of what could have been a truly spectacular episode. The series looked less imaginative for the most part and lost much of its distinctive cinematic ""feel"".
The picture quality and sound quality on the discs is very good overall. In fact, the picture is so sharp at times that wires are evident during some of the special effects sequences. The sound is somewhat muted particularly during the dialog sequences. This was a minor flaw that effected the first season as well and is probably related to the transfer and the high fidelity DVD's and television sets now.
It should be noted that this really was only a partial season. The first season consisted of over 30 episodes. The Outer Limits was cancelled after a disasterous run against the Jackie Gleason show (which, admittedly was well written and performed but hasn't aged quite as well as Limits). In today's world, The Outer Limits would probably have been kept on because it captures a completely different demographic that spends  a lot of money. Sadly, advertisers and network were ignorant of this fact in 1963-4.
The best episodes are worth a 5 star rating while the worst 1 or 2 at best, hence an average of 3 stars. There's a missed opportunity here with this disc. While many of the particpants are dead, Robert Culp, Harlan Ellison, original series producer Joseph Stefano, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Duvall are all very much alive. Considering the price of this set, could it have hurt MGM to put together a featurette on the genesis and making of the series? There's plenty of historical info around (as evidenced by the book The Outer Limits Companion)to compliment the DVDs. Instead, we get a bare bones presentation with little info outside of a synposis and credits on each episode.
A commentary from Shatner, Ellison, Stefano and Culp would have been welcome. It also would have made this boxed set more valuable to long time fans curious about the inner workings of the show. Additionally, the advertising material and many of the teasers probably still exist. Why not include these? I have a copy of one of Joe Stefano's scripts, so I don't think it would have been impossible to include a comparison between a couple of key episodes (such as Ellison's Soldier) between first draft and final shooting script.
The Outer Limits had as much of an impact as The Twilight Zone despite a shorter lifespan. It influenced a generation of writers/directors/producers/actors as witnessed by Star Trek, Babylon 5, Farscape and other notable sf series. I just feel that there was so much more to offer and now that opportunity has been lost. Regardless, I am happy to finally have the entire series available. It's a glimpse into a different era for television, science fiction and the world at large.",1062374400,6,7023,4.891778523489933
1898986,5,B00009Y3RE,"There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling transmission. If we wish to make it louder, we will bring up the volume. If we wish to make it softer, we will tune it to a whisper. We can reduce the focus to a soft blur, or sharpen it to crystal clarity. We will control the horizontal. We will control the vertical. For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear. You are about to experience the awe and mystery, which reaches from the inner mind to - The Outer Limits.

1898987,5,B00009Y3RE,"When ""The Outer Limits"" was first being broadcast, I began to dream of having a complete set of all the episodes, to watch whenever I wanted.  That was forty years ago.  With the publication of this set, the dream I've had since I was a teenager is finally coming true.
""Demon With A Glass Hand"" and ""Soldier"" get all the publicity, because of who wrote them, rather than any inherent quality of their own, but there are better episodes in this stack. ""Wolf 359"", which was probably inspired by Sturgeon's ""Microcosmic God"" and ""The Duplicate Man"", based on Clifford Simak's incomparable ""Good Night, Mr. James"" would be reason enough to buy this set. But towering above them all is the wonderful and poignant two part episode, ""The Inheritors,"" which, for sheer power of storytelling and acting towers above all the other episodes in the season put together, and leaves them in the dust.
With the release of this DVD set, I think M.G.M. has finally justified its existence. To Joseph Stefano, who brought this miracle into being I say, ""May G_d bless and keep you, and thank you from my heart.""",1060128000,9,1095,4.727748691099476
1898988,5,B00009Y3RE,"Season 2 contains only 17 episodes because ABC canceled the series in mid season. However it features 2 of what sci-fi fans considers the finest tv (or film) shows ever produced ""Soldier"" & ""Demon With the Glass Hand"" by Harlan Ellison. If you have never seen the series,then these two episodes are a must, it puts a shame to Terminator/Alien .... As a matter of fact James Cameron's Terminator is ""borrow"" from ""Soldier"". OL is a pioneering series that is far beyond science fiction it is drama love mystery and the meaning of life. Check it out,the only negative its that MGM package the DVDs in double sided discs making it very clumsy to handle. *****MGM have re-issue the series in 3 parts Season 1 is split into vol 1 & 2, vol 3 is actually all 17 episodes from season 2.

As to the shows, ABC cut the budget of the truncated series to such a degree that the last shows from the winter of '64-65 are truly laughable. The Probe, Premonition, Counterweight and The Duplicate Man are all on the silly side. The Duplicate man has a monster, the Megasoid, which is so deadly all it can do is grab it's victims. Like the gorilla in some cheap 1940's horror flick. All it can do is grab someone and wrestle them to the ground. Is that really scary?

1899067,4,B00009Y3RE,Outer Limits was a ground-breaking sci-fi series produced in the mid 60's.  It used REAL published sci-fi authors to write the speculative fiction for this series.  Some of the stories were truly inventive and subsequent developments in science have vindicated the ideas behind the stories.  Once example is The Inheritors.  The writing is excellent and the lack of notable special effects shows that sci-fi doesn't require CGI or other costly technologies to tell a compelling story.  It is all the more amazing that this series ran on Broadcast TV.,1428278400,,550,5.134831460674158

It is what is (although wary, I have been buying my old shows here on Amazon as instant video and having them saved online...I hope Amazon stays in business, otherwise what happens to our library of music and videos?
Invisible Enemy has to be one of the better episodes. (many were great, some terrible). Now, Invisible Enemy could have been a great movie. It had the spirit of the 1960's space race. The exotic imagination of what Mars was believed to be like. Obviously, I am not going to spoil the episode.
Other ""space-race"" stories in the Outer Limits were just like this too.
Actors? Oh yes. Some very young but familiar faces make appearances in this series, sometimes more than once! If you like the 1970's and 1980's series and movies, you will note them here.
Bad episodes?
Well, yes. We have, ""The Forms of Things Unknown"" possibly the worse one Outer Limits had to offer. Poor acting. Poor concept. Seemed more like a (poorly written) Alfred Hitchcock Presents storyline then an Outer Limits story. And it just so happens to be the Amazon cover photo above!

Bottom line, worth buying as an online viewing with only one really terrible episode. Even so, it will entertain as long as you also note that this is not 21st century production special effects, but good for its time.",1426204800,,1427,4.57421875

Episodes like Demon With The Glass Hand, Cold Hands - Warm Heart , The Soldier and The Man Who Was Never Born are some of the best examples of classic tv Sci-Fi.

1899147,5,B00009Y3RE,"""I, Robot"" provides a milder trek to the Outer Limits of science fiction with the assistance of Leonard Nimoy as the cynical, H.L. Menckenesque  news reporter Judson Ellis. Adam Link, the gentle mechanical man created by a well-beloved scientist, Dr. Charles Link, finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when his creator is killed through a freak accident in his lab. Unlike the Frankenstein monster, who turns on his creator, and whose story is paralleled by that of Adam Link, Adam Link embodies the distinctly human trait of self sacrifice. Adam Link endeared himself to me as he is shown learning to be a person in our world. His heroic actions put us humans to shame. This episode is certainly one that children should see--when I was a child my parents found most of ""The Outer Limits"" too violent and intense for a child of 8 years. Fifty years later it is heartwarming and moving. I wish that I had a companion like Adam Link! It is worth the nominal cost!",1390176000,2,976,4.609195402298851

There was a lawsuit because of this and thus at the end of the movie there is a caption that gives credit to ""the work"" of Harlen Ellison.
 I can see some similarities: The traveling through time, the elecrical lightning when they ""arrive"", the pursuing of the one by the other one, along with police interrogation.  I was a bit disappointed I guess because some of the early Outer Limits episodes were a bit hard to follow and the acting a bit stilted.  The movie made the whole idea very cut and dry and specific. The show left some things a bit unclear and muddled.  With this being said.  I did appreciate it for it's historical and cultural significance.

1899191,5,B00009Y3RE,"This series was not cut down. These episodes actually contain extra scenes & mild nudity never seen in the US. I was quite surprised when I first saw all of these extra scenes never shown for US audiences. You are not getting less. You are getting more than the original. There is nothing fake about this DVD set other than one reviewers wild false misperceptions.

While the mild nude scenes don't add to the quality of the shows; you certainly are not getting less than the version which aired in the US and is tastefully done so it wasn't a distraction. For example, one episode, ""From Within"" had background streakers & brief background cast nudes which were only shown for a couple seconds in a few scenes which were also quite busy with a half dozen other cast members in various stages of disarray as the town became wild from salt mine parasites. So you had to watch closely to see them. But other episodes in the series with intimate scenes like Valerie or Mary, among others, had the intimate encounters unmistakably front & center on the screen but still only for a minute.

The review of the snap boxes is also correct. These quite tightly hold 3 DVDs on each foldout section and are snug to remove & reseat. These holders are not fragile like our pitiful US center snap DVD brackets which become loose or shattered & allow damage during shipping. These DVD brackets snap at the outer edges in a curve which keeps the DVD in place & prevents the DVDs from slipping free.

The only negative is the lack of subtitles or closed captioning. Only season one has it. I have no hearing problem but I, too have gotten used to having captioning since 1985. It helps on productions which insist on having blaring music drowning out the actors. (a problem with 90% of movie & TV productions over the past 15 years). It also helps with hearing the dialog in a noisy room & it often shows dialog of background characters which is inaudible. It is also great for understanding mumbling actors & unintelligible accents. It is also a wonderful supplement if you have a sleeping spouse or other household member because it allows you to turn down the sound so the sleeper is not disturbed as you watch TV. Headphones are not always practical.

Captioning  also saves the sanity of hearing family members when you have an inconsiderate senior who is hard of hearing & rudely blasts the TV volume inflicting unbearable suffering upon other household members. Having consistently used captioning & subtitles on all of my TV & movie viewing for nearly 27 years, I feel significantly deprived when there is no captioning available. So imagine how the lack of captioning or subtitles affects someone with a hearing problem. Captioning is not only for the deaf. There are millions who are hard of hearing & it is not a matter of age. Many are young from loud music habits or from job related noise or accidental damage. Captioning also helps those who are not fully adept with the English language. Captions should be a required option on all videos. Then the viewer has a choice.

For those who have not used captioning, the only time the screen text is a problem is on Cable News & weather channels which insist on blocking the bottom 3rd of the screen with trash items. Just boycott their programs. Captioning is not a problem on shows like outer limits. At first, you may initially be distracted by captions, but it only takes a couple weeks to learn how to multitask so you can read & watch the scenes at the same time. In a short time, you won't be conscious of the captions as you become accustomed to them. You can enjoy both the program & captioning without it detracting from the program.

This is a superb series. I highly recommend it. In fact, I'm purchasing a second copy of season 2 after my DVD carousel ate one of the disks & damaged one episode. I don't want to be without any of these fantastic episodes.",1338076800,2,3911,4.586552217453505
1899192,4,B00009Y3RE,"As I mentioned in comments on other's reviews of this box, I was VERY torn about purchasing this box set.

On the one hand, from what I read many said they were the edited for U.S. syndication versions, not the original Showtime versions (which won't really matter after season.....what season did Sci-Fi channel take the show over? I forget.)

On the other hand, I never had Showtime so, even if edited, these probably are the versions I have seen, and they were/are awesome as is.

But the REAL bottom line was that many of my VHSs, especially the first couple seasons, have become degraded to the point where they are unwatchable so, guess I have to bite the bullet if I want to retain copies of my favorite episodes.

Well - I received it last weekend, have watched over a dozen episodes and can definitively say that I saw a level of nudity that would have not been allowed on regular American TV in the mid-late 90s. And, as others have mentioned, some violence and language as well. So they are definitely NOT the edited for TV versions. Maybe SOMETHING was taken out, but I know I am seeing scenes I never saw in syndication!

And my packaging seems to be different than most of these complaints as well. My discs are staggered 3 each in hard plastic snaps, none were loose and, in fact, are harder to snap out than the regular center spindle snap we are used to in DVD boxes.

Based on this I will probably be getting seasons 3-5 as well. Then I'll be satisfied because most of my favorite episodes are in the first 5 seasons anyway. So I guess I'll see for myself if they are edited or not.

I do have one nitpick though; no subtitles!! Yes that may sound ridiculous to a lot of you but I have gotten used to turning them on when watching a DVD in bed as the wife goes to sleep. Oh well, maybe this'll be my excuse to finally get that pair of wireless headphones I have been looking at since Christmas!!",1337904000,2,1913,4.356741573033708

lousy packaging. I am not going to describe the packaging because others have described how bad the packaging is.
But again the discs played well and the picture quality is pretty good. I give the item four stars because of the packaging.

All the episodes are good but space will not allow me to describe each episode. Here are some that stand out:

* A Stitch In Time: A time traveler goes back in time and kills condemed killers before the can commit their crimes. An FBI agent catches on to the time travelers activities.

* From Within: A mentally challenged young man saves a town from self destruction.

* The Sentence: A scientist creates a virtual prison. Convicts experience years in prison in mere hours. The scientist will find out just how well the invention works.

1899205,5,B00009Y3RE,"Loved this TV series in the nineties. Great science fiction in self-contained stories (one does not have to watch all the episodes in order as they stand alone).

The point of me writing this review is the packaging issue mentioned in other reviews. I recently picked this season up from a vendor other than Amazon. The packaging was better/different than described by other reviewers (I do own seasons of this show with the exact terrible packaging that others have described). I seems that the manufacturer may be using better/different cases for these series at this point. The new packaging has a black soft plastic case (with its own artwook) within the outer cardboard cover. Each disc is seated in the case with its own retainer center ring - no disc sits on top of another.  The discs will stay put in shipping and will/did not rub against each other - no discs were scratched in shipping or handling. I also receved Season 4 of this series (from a 3rd vendor) and it came in the same new packaging.  (Neither season appears to be a bootleg)

I have no idea when the manufacturer changed the packaging - or how much bad packaging was produced before this change was made, but you may not get the bad packaging with these seasons at this point.

(I did recently pick up Seasons 3,5,6, and 7 - not from Amazon - and these seasons came in the bad packaging. I would say 4-5 discs - per season - in the bad packaging were scrathed - however, with spot checking all the discs I received seemed to play ok on my player.)

Bottom line: if you order these you take a risk in getting scratched discs, HOWEVER, there does seem to be some new packaging with these that increase the chances of getting your discs in perfect condition.

Take care and good luck.

1899223,5,B00009Y3RE,"Comparisons to The Twilight Zone abound. But this was NOT supposed to be that at all.

But what it is makes this a very unique series, especially considering the times in which it was produced.

While in many ways the production values are dated, the effects 'simple', these very things make it very much a time capsule of the era in which it was born.

Just as colorization ruins black and white movies, updated graphics and effects ruins the unique qualities of shows like this and Star Trek (which did have everything updated in a new release - and Star Wars, also rather not worth the effort, George). I personally prefer the original to be as it was originally presented.

Part of the charm of these things is that they had limited resources. I love seeing the inventiveness, the innovation, employed in making things credible, believable. I like seeing how they interpret the visuals in spite of those limitations (whether budgetary or technologically). ""Updating"" ruins this. Fortunately, TOL didn't get this treatment.

Both seasons were wonderful, and I remember my father telling me that many of the stories were based, in part, or had their genesis from stories he read as a youngster (back in the 1920, 30s and 40s).

The quality of the story telling was surprisingly consistent and rarely ever fell below expectations. Watching these again all these years later, restored to full length, reminds me why I so love good science fiction, and why much of the sci fi today is a joke.

It's the story and the characters, not the sex, explosions and special effects. Effects are expected, of course, but only in service to good story telling.",1295049600,,1648,4.822695035460993
1899224,3,B00009Y3RE,"Be assurred, the dvd cases/packaging is AS BAD AS YOU HAVE READ. At first one might think that the plastic
that is supposssed to hold the dvds in place is what most of us havee seen and been happy with before. BUT look
a little closer and one realizes that this plastic packaging is designed to hold the outer edges of the dvd. There are therefore no RETAINER RINGS to hold the DVDS. In short the packaging designed to hold the DVDS is a COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURE. It is a problem like this that keeps a good TV show out of circulation. I ordered seasons two and three in the mail. The seasons came and several of the DVDS in both seasons were LOOSE and the DVDS WERE SCRATCHED.

As for the quality of the image, it is often WASHED OUT.

A problem which may be unique to my end is in the playback of these dvds. I have a Samsung DVD/VCR recorder. For some reason these discs are constantly running in a choppy manner, advancing many image frames ahead. I don't know if this is a uniform problem or if this problem is associated with my Samnsung. Now the Samsung is hooked up to my NEW Sony Bravia flatscreen tv. Mostly the image on the tv looks strange. I don't know why I have this problem with many of my dvds but the problem exists. As far as the screen advancing several frames, this does seem to be a playback thing. I have only seen this happen on one dvd of three movies. I threw that dvd out. But so far this is a consistent problem on all of Season Two.

So, in summation, the show is pretty good. I only have problem with the playback and the packaging is of course CRAP.

Also, I carefully removed all of the packaging. The plastic inserts are only held in place in each of the four corners. It is some of that sticky silicone stuff so you can pull the inserts right out. I then packaged all of the dvds in plastic CD/DVD plastic sleeves and then put the discs where the inserts used to be. It works and it is a good solution to HORRIBLE packaging.",1292112000,2,1960,4.190981432360743
1899225,3,B00009Y3RE,"I agree with previous reviewers that this has to be the worst designed packaging I have ever seen for holding DVDs. I rate the episodes 4-stars.  I would have rated the episodes 5-stars - except Canadian Home Video censored them to remove the occasional female bare breast that was shown in the MGM releases. However the boxes all these Canadian Home Video DVDs came in rates 0-stars, so I am giving this product an overall rating of 3-stars.

To keep from damaging the Outer Limits DVDs trying to remove them from the Canadian box, or while putting them back in, I found the best way is to put all the DVDs into an empty ""spindle"" box that had originally held blank CDs or DVDs.

I bought all 6 of the Canadian Home Video sets (Seasons two thru seven), dumped the boxes, & put all the Outer Limits DVDs (in order) into an empty spindle box that I had originally bought from Staples & that had held 40 blank DVD+RW discs. Now I can easily lift out any year & episode I want to watch, without having to fight the stupid little plastic clips holding each DVD in its Canadian box. The season number, disk number, & episode name are clearly shown on top of each DVD, so it is easy to find the one I want.  Problem solved.",1287187200,8,1217,4.324561403508772

I think one episode is edited a bit (Paradise) and has different closing music, but I'm not complaining as besides the music it's how I remember it on Syndicated TV anyway! All in all, great product! Now... The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5? The DVD packaging is TERRIBLE! I don't know who was smoking meth or crack or what when they designed the inside of the case, but it's the WORST design I've EVER laid eyes on! The DVDs WILL come loose no matter what you do, and could be prone to scratching! Luckily mine haven't been scratched... yet...

That said, this is one of my favorite series, a rare example of a vintage show revival that is as good, in its own right, as the original.  As with any anthology show, some stories are better than others, but generally the level is surprisingly good.  Writing and acting are way above the norm for a TV series.

This Canadian release does contain one episode that was edited for commercial TV (""Paradise"").  Unfortunately this is not the case with the season 3 and 4 releases, which are all edited.  (The originals were presented on Showtime and contained occasional nudity and the odd four-letter expletive, which were removed for syndication.)

The video quality is not that great --- if you compare it with the U.S. Season 1 release, you'll see what I mean.  Also, there are no extras or subtitles.

Still, at long last we have the complete (almost complete) Season 2 on DVD.  This is a very entertaining show that deserves a wider audience.",1280966400,37,1040,4.722222222222222

Snow and picture distortions due to external antennae made watching then a challenge. My point is this the DVD set really brings the old series to life with a clarity that lends to viewing pleasure. The special effects are dated and content might seem tame compared to present day SCI-FI creations but personally I like this more, even with the flaws that die hard realists might point out.

1899243,4,B00009Y3RE,"Having read many a rant from my fellow reviewers, about how there is nothing new in this most recent DVD release of The Outer Limits, I should like to bring their attention to the one and only DVD release of the 1978 Battlestar Galactica, some years back.

Priced a copy lately? Or been able to locate one, period? Without competition from an ever-continuing flow of new releases, the lucky owners of those finite few copies can, and are naming their own price.

  I got into the DVD universe fairly recently compared to many of you. But soon enough, I discovered the thrill of being able to go down to my local Wal-Mart or Best Buy(I didn't know about Amazon yet!), and purchasing whole seasons of my favorite shows to watch as many times as I wanted, without having to scour flea markets for old VHS tapes. In the case of The Outer Limits, I didn't know it was a reissue. And what's more...I didn't care. I've since purchased all three volumes, and have been quite happy with each.

These are worthy additions to my video library. They play well, the images sparklingly clear, with no freeze-ups or skips. The menu is cleverly designed, and the outer case is attractive and inviting. My only complaint, and its the reason I didn't award the set five stars, is that the sound is rather muddled. And not in just a few episodes, but EVERY SINGLE episode in all three volumes! I compared select portions of the soundtrack to that of VHS copies I'd made years earlier off the Sci-Fi Channel. The difference is pronounced, especially in the background music. Whereas the full orchestra effect is faithfully reproduced on the TV copy, on DVD we hear only the higher-pitched notes. I really don't understand this. You'd think they would have corrected the problem after the first volume, but no. Changing the sound setting on my television to ""Theater"" has improved things, but not enough.

Perhaps in the next reissue?",1263859200,,1913,4.695522388059701
1899244,5,B00009Y3RE,"As a child growing up,  I fee in love with the original ""Outer Limits Series.""  Now, Amazon is offering the original black and white classic episodes at a great price for sci-fi enthusiasts like myself.  These discs include:  ""architects of fear,""  ""A feasibility study,"" ""The Zanti Misfits,"" ""Fun and Games,"" ""The Mutant"", ""Children of Spider County,"" ""The Man with the Power,"" ""Do not open till Domesday"",  ""The Man who was never Born.""  I am enjoying these episodes immensely and reliving some great childhood memories.

I highly recommend this collection.  My only beef is that the entire first season could have been offered as a special collector's set, probably on two disks.  Then, fans could purchase all the first season episodes under a sort of package deal.  Still, all in all, I consider this to be a fantatic offer.",1249862400,,829,4.934782608695652
1899245,5,B00009Y3RE,"While there are fewer outstanding episodes in this second half of the first year collection, there are many memorable favorites.  My personal favorites are Moonstone (the discovery of good reps of a very alien race in civil war), the Mutant (a human explorer become part of a planet's eco-system, to frightening consequences for his colleagues), the coming together of humans to save their race (A Feasibility Study, easily the most moving episode I have ever seen on TV), and that modern Gladiatorial arena, Fun and Games.  This is absolutely first rate sci fi that pushes the envelope, never to be surpassed in my view.  (I mean Star Trek is great, but it is largely pap.)

That being said, most of the other episodes also have wonderfully subtle and sophisticated twists, such as the alien who is studying humans inside a massive brain/computer that suspends aging (The Guests), the rebellious son who is becoming the instrument of alien invaders (the SPecial One), and the second thoughts of Robert Duvall in The Chamelon.  There are images in these that lived in my mind for decades, such as the woman rapidly aging outside the alien sanctuary or Duvall's mysterious laughter at his extreme physical transformation.

Of course, there are some real dogs in this batch as well, such as the Strange Particle or ZZZZZ.  They make little sense, aren't good stories, and lack believable scientific explanations.

Warmly recommended.  This stuff is the real deal, at their best mixing drama, wonderful scenarios, and fascinating concepts.  The endings are often sad or ambiguous, there is no mediocre deus ex machina happy endings like the ones that so often ruin otherwise great plots on Star Trek and other TV sci-fi.",1248480000,2,1717,5.014084507042254
1899246,4,B00009Y3RE,"The original Outer Limits was very good for it's time. The first season was outstanding. Right from the mysterious opening narration by Vic Perrin, to the ending credits. The first season was produced by it's creator Joseph Stefano. The musical score, and great music cues, were composed by Dominic Frontiere. The second season was a different story. Stefano left after the first season. The opening narration was shortened. The music replaced with a much more inferior version. There were only about five decent episodes out of a short season of seventeen shows. Like other great shows, it was ahead of it's time, like other sci-fi shows ""The Invaders"" and ""Star Trek."" 1960s audiences, so used to the westerns on TV, they did not embrace the show. Changing the format, along with stiff competition, caused a cancelation. The cult like following however produced the newer version that aired from 1995-2002. If you get both seasons, you won't be disappointed though. I just liked the first season much more than the second.",1246838400,,1024,5.029411764705882
1899247,5,B00009Y3RE,"This was my intoroduction to sci-fi when I was in 2nd grade.  Certain episodes were so vivid that they etched themselves permanently in my memory.  Upon watching them again, I see how they are also emotionally appealing and surprisingly sophisticated, both in their science and in the lack of ""feel good"" deus ex machina endings that mar so many otherwise excellent Star Trek stories.

I think by far the best story of this lot is ""The Man Who was Never Born"", which exudes a kind of timeless anguish.  It still moves me to think of the deformed Landau, who was truly brilliant.  But the ""Architects of Fear"" is also wonderful, with the good man sacrificing himself in vain and communicating his love to his wife from his horribly altered form.  They are both tragedies with grand conceptions behind them, truly unique. ""The Galaxy Being"" and ""The Sixth Finger"" are also deeply affecting and believable in their way.  These are all timeless themes in hard sci-fi, done extremely well.

There are some bad episodes too, but overall the good ones are worth the price of admission.  I do not see why some reviewers are angry at the format of splitting season 1 into 2 volumes - it doesn't cost more.

1899251,4,B00009Y3RE,"I give this product a four star rating. I only subtract one star because I, like many others, do NOT like flipper discs (two-sided DVDs). That does, indeed, make them more prone to some sort of damage than one-sided discs, but it's still easy enough to handle them without damaging them if you are even moderately careful. Other than that, despite the terrible reviews given by others, I have been VERY happy with my purchase.

I have read most of the reviews, good and bad, as I always do, and was hesitant to buy this series, which I love! What I purchased was a bundled set featuring Volume 1 and Volume 2 (which together comprise the entire first season). The Outer Limits was always one of my favorite shows, and I was disheartened when I read the bad reviews about how the picture was grainy and not remastered, about the fact that they were flipper discs, and especially the ones who stated flatly that this set was a ripoff and an attempt to resell bad merchandise. Personally, I find those types of reviews a bit irresponsible unless the reviewers have proof of what they say.

[...]

I have not had a single glitch. Not one. I know others have said their DVDs skipped, froze or otherwise hosed up on them, and I have no doubt this is true, however I liken many of these horrible reviews to people who rave about playing the lotto because they could win millions, or people who refuse to fly because they hear about crashes and think it will happen to them, as well. I used to take all these types of reviews more seriously than I do now, until I discovered that, despite the fact that I have bought several DVDs that were also given bad reviews by others due to faulty packaging, flawed product, etc, I have NEVER had any of that happen to me! I would be willing to bet a lot of money that none of these issues will happen to YOU either, if you purchase this product. We read a bad review, jerk our knees and decide not to buy this 'garbage' because someone else had problems with theirs.

As I mentioned, I have friends who always play the lottery, citing the news stories about those who HAVE won millions. The fact that the odds of winning are astronomical (you stand a better chance of being hit by lightning THREE times in a single year and LIVING than hitting the lotto jackpot) doesn't deter them at all. In essence, they are very likely tossing their money down the drain. Very slowly, I grant you, but they are still doing so. I also alluded to plane crashes and people who refuse to fly because they read about some horrific plane crash and get scared that it's going to happen to them. Again, the odds of that happening are FAR worse than being seriously injured in a car crash, yet they don't think twice about driving, but won't fly. Thousands of planes take off every day. How many major crashes do we hear about each year? Two? Maybe three?

This may all sound silly, but I mention these two examples because, in my personal experience, it's the same type of thing as believing that just because a few people had bad experiences with the DVDs they bought, that YOU will too. It's the frustration factor. If you are dissatisfied with something, you are quite likely to complain to others about it, whereas if you like the product, you are far less likely to tell people that you like it unless you are asked. I believe the odds are greatly against you receiving a faulty product if you bought this DVD set. I do understand those who have posted that this product deserves only one or two stars are frustrated and are being sincere, but they are only basing it on one person's experience - their own. Yes, there are others who also say they have had problems, but do you really think the VAST majority of these DVD sets are defective? If so, you may just be among those who also believe you really have a decent chance of winning the lotto or getting in a plane crash. I would bet the farm that neither will EVER happen to you, just as I know the odds are excellent that you will NOT wind up with the problems that are posted here. If you are truly concerned about receiving a defective product, I would recommend purchasing this DVD new, rather than used. If there are THAT many defective DVDs out there (which I personally doubt), I would not risk buying from a previous owner. Especially since you can find this Outer Limits DVD brand new at a low price if you shop around.

I really don't wish to get on a soapbox about this, but truly, I have about a dozen DVDs about which, were you to go through all the Amazon reviews, you would find many complaining about quality issues, yet I have not had a single thing go wrong with any of them! That's gospel truth.

The Outer Limits package I purchased contain the entire first season of 32 episodes and, at 15 bucks for all of that (these are also HOUR LONG episodes, don't forget), the set I purchased was a major BARGAIN! You may be able to get this for even less than I paid! These episodes may not be pristine transfers that were remastered, but neither are they overly grainy. They look and sound okay to me. I'm very happy with mine. For that price, how can I not be? As I say, had these NOT been on flipper discs, I would have easily given this set five stars. If you are an Outer Limits fan, this is a very good deal, indeed!

Peace.

**UPDATE** I have now watched the entire second volume and there has not been a single skip, freeze or other glitch. What a great, fun show this is! I have ordered the third volume, which gives me the entire series. It was extremely affordable. I will be viewing volume 3 soon. I hope, and fully expect, it will be the same great value that volumes 1 & 2 were. I have been completely honest in this review. I will be honest in reviewing volume 3, as well.

Glad I came to Amazon first before I did. What's all this BS about the second season product being defective and Sony/MGM not doing anything about it? It seems like a lot of OL fans like me got royally ripped off, and I feel for you. How sad that the powers that be appear to be thumbing their noses as their customers.

My suggestion, for whatever it might be worth: Have any of you who received defective disc sets and did not receive quality replacements considered reporting Sony/MGM to the Better Business Bureau?

To highlight which episodes deal with the aforementioned would be an injustice; thus, I will let that ""discovery"" and/or ""interpretaion"" be left to the viewer.

""The Outer Limits"" showcased some of the best acting talent, veteran and on the rise, of any show of its era.  Old pros like George Macready, Walter Burke, Neil Hamilton, Kent Smith, Simon Oakland, John Hoyt, Miriam Hopkins, McDonald Carey, and Signe Hasso guest in some of the best installments in this collection.  While their hit roles are just around the corner, this collection also features performances by a pre-Spock Leonard Nimoy, Sally Kellerman before the theatrical ""M*A*S*H,"" Richard Dawson before ""Hogan's Heroes"" and ""Family Feud,"" Marion Ross before her days were ""happy,"" and Robert Duvall before his Oscar and Emmy.

This compilation features the last sixteen of the show's first season and contains six that were among my all-time favorites: ""Don't Open Till Doomsday,"" ""The Bellero Shield,"" ""Moonstone,"" ""The Forms of Things Unknown,"" ""The Guests,"" and ""The Forms of Things Unknown.""

Now, after this viewing I must add ""A Feasibility Study,"" ""The Mutant,"" ""Second Chance,"" ""The Children of Spider County,"" ""The Invisibles,"" ""The Chameleon,"" and ""The Special One.""

The set loses a star, however, because MGM should've given this classic show a five-star treatment, improving both the video and audio transfers.",1190851200,11,1907,5.308970099667774

1899268,1,B00009Y3RE,"This review is not about the content itself and does not reflect on the original ""Outer Limits"" television series.  That part is great, and has been for over 40 years.

I DO have a problem, however, at how CHEAP the presentation of this DVD set is.  MGM have shown themselves to have NO CLASS and care only about making the most profit rather than doing a landmark, historical TV series its due justice.

AVOID this box set.  I've had problems with both my first order and the replacement sent quickly by Amazon.  Both have a defective section of the first side of disc 2 in which both ""I Robot"" and the first part of ""The Inheritors"" will not play on a DVD player nor a DVD ROM drive.  Strangely, ""Wolf 352"" played fine.

I'm sure this is partially due to the CHEAP presentation of this box set.  The small episode guide is helpful if very bare bones, but no doubt the technical problems are due in part to the CHEAP decision to CRAM as many episodes as they can on one disc by using both sides of the DVD.  I've often had problems with these kinds of discs, and almost never with standard DVDs that play on only one side.

How much does a blank DVD cost?  Not even a buck?  And for MGM, it's even less than that.

They're just out to make a quick buck on this one, that's clear.  Don't even get me started on the TOTAL lack of DVD extras-- no subtitles, languages, no audio setup options, no nothing.  I'm sure that after everybody who really wanted the whole series buys this anyways, MGM will wait a couple years and reissue it as a ""deluxe set""-- like they should have done in the first place-- to make more money on selling you the same thing twice.  They're greedy and no-class.  Would it have hurt them to put out the series on a greater number of high quality discs instead of cramming all those hours of programming on just a few cheap double sides?  I would've been willing to pay more for a higher quality product.  After all, people are buying these because they want to keep them and watch them for nostalgia's sake.

I also received season 1 as a gift, and I had to return it because it was missing the episode guide.  Luckily, the replacement had the episode guide and doesn't seem to have any technical problems, but the quality control on these products is obviously very questionable.",1187049600,7,2303,4.382075471698113

1899272,5,B00009Y3RE,"Technically NOTHING deserves 5 stars... as there is always something or someone that is less than perfect, but this show deserves at least the five stars for effort.
  another five stars for the one element of this show that remained constant and to my mind was the MOST rewarding, even after all the monsters and weird goings on, was the humanity.  There was always a conscious effort by everyone, from writers, to producers, to actors, to add the ""human"" element to each story. Whether it was Quarlo's devotion and sacrifice towards his new human family in ""Soldier"",or William Shatner's wife providing her love and support towards his recovery in ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart"" you always understood that the only real part of humanity was it heart and soul(s).It was also the one thing that made us mere humans superior to even the most ""advanced"" aliens.
  This is evident in both years of this series life,and to me, made it superior to even more popular shows of the time.
  I also remember that it also scared the ""bejeezus"" out of me on more than one occasion.
  Yes, the special effects were, and are, kind of cheesy, but who cares!? it was 1963, there was no I.L.M. or anything else like it around at the time. Maybe George Pal could have come up with more realistic effects but he wasn't there! so nyah!
  Harlan Ellison once told me, that anthology T.V. shows like this never succeed because the audience likes to have a person or persons to follow every week, and that there also needed to be 'the bear on the beach"" something to scare them, a boogy man if you will.
 For a weekly show like this it became harder and harder to create a logical and at the same time frightening ""bear"".
  I encourage all the younger viewers out there to watch this series with someone who may have watched it when it was first on or just by themselves and then sit back and think about what they have seen, you'll discover there is more there than meets the eye, and THAT, my friends, is the essence of Sci Fi!.",1183075200,2,2001,4.5069252077562325

1899279,2,B00009Y3RE,"The first season of ""The Outer Limits"" was the best. Sure the second season had some classic episodes (among them ""Solider"" and ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" which inspired James Cameron to come up with ""The Terminator"". I'd give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue. Why? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time. They haven't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.

Don't get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was ""The Outer Limits"" as its best. Also we get ""The Galaxy Being"" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in ""The Sixth Finger"" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.

""The Zanti Misfits"" like much of Stefano's work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get ""The Borderlands"" and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like ""Human Factor"" but almost everything here is terrific even if we're only getting half a season at a higher price than before.

Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on ""The Outer Limits""? Because MGM is convinced that you'll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they've split them up. Heck, the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs. Nope. These are dual sided as well.

So what do you get? 16 episodes--half the first season of the series. In August you can get the second half of the first season. I'm at a loss here--why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package? The only reason is so that retailers (such as Best Buy) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again. If you're going to do this at least give us some extras (a featurette on the visual effects, vintage interviews with the late Joe Stefano or Leslie Stevens, commentary tracks with Suchow discussing the making of the episode.

With today's  technology, you could, at least, obtain a complete restoration from the original 35 mm prints.

I advise all ""Outer Limits"" diehard fans to read a full account of the lowdown first DVD edition by getting this publication serving as an evidence for the future: ""Video Watchdog"", n 89 and n 102, November 2002 and December 2003, articles by ""Outer Limits"" expert David J. Schow. I reject this vulgar 2007 DVD edition that deserves to be dumped into the ""Pit"" (Cf. ""It Crawled out of the Woodwork"")! I believe that the right action from the Studio would be to re-release the entire season in one single set including:

- 32 restored copies

- the two ""restored"" alternate pilots (""Please Stand By"" and ""The Unknown"")

- restored trailers and promos

- audio commentaries by expert David J. Schow

- interviews with ""Outer Limits"" cast and crew

- isolated scores

Still, I can't NOT give it 5 stars, because even if someone just starts with this cynically-marketed set, they will discover the best gothic horror sci-fi series ever on television, and that's something.

I really enjoyed this series. Obviously, by today's special effects standards, it's completely hokie. However, the plots, the acting, and even the cheesey costumes were outstanding for the 1960's. The writers had timeless science fiction plots that could make great stories even now.  However, something vital would be lost if these episodes were to be reproduced today. Part of the ""fun"" IS the hokieness! It adds something extra to the series.

Another point of interest is that many high quality actors got their first start doing television on the Outer Limits series. Some of these include: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan, Martin Landau, and many other familiar faces that have been seen on television for years.

1899294,5,B00009Y3RE,"I have been thoroughly enjoying Season One of The Outer Limits that I just purchased about a week ago. Then I read all the reviews of Season Two here at Amazon about the defective discs, and now I'm not sure that I want to go through all the BS of trying to find a Season Two set that works.

Obviously this was a result of a manufacturing plant mistake somewhere that produced hundreds of defective discs that were not quality checked and should have been recalled and reproduced.

Then I also read in the reviews that the distribution and manufacture of these discs were controlled by Sony. That explained everything. About 98% of everything I've bought from Sony since the company became well known in the 70's has been defective, including their electronics, audio and video recording tapes, and even their recordable CD's. You can tell that they are absolutely apathetic and irresponsible to the consumer market in general, and only care about making money instead of manufacturing usable quality product!

Two days ago I read about how MGM/Sony botched the DVD release of ""Koyaanisqatsi"". I was wondering why my copy of that movie looked so blurry and grainy, and it's because MGM/Sony didn't care about releasing a quality product. All they cared about was slapping a crappy print transfer onto a disc, so they could rip off all the lovers of this film. I have a VHS copy of it that looks 75% more clear than the DVD I bought to replace the tape! The DVD is pure crap!

And then there is Warner Brothers! A year ago they released the first season of Murphy Brown, and now either refuse to continue to release the rest of the seasons of the Emmy winning series, or are just sitting around waiting for some kind of grass to grow up their butts!

Fans of Welcome Back Kotter, The Drew Carey Show, Chico And The Man and other Warner controlled series are now being treated to single disc releases of these shows that some cheesehead at the company has picked as the ""best"" of the series. They pick out about 6 shows, and put them on a cheap disc. They're not even bothering to release these series as most other TV series are being released, season by season!

And last but most importantly, not least......fans of The Twilight Zone have been pleading Warner to release the 1983 film ""Twilight Zone-The Movie"", starring the late Vic Morrow and John Lithgow, for YEARS, only to be totally ignored!

MGM/Sony and Warner Brothers are the only two companies that seem to have a total and blatant lack of respect for the American consumer that puts the steaks on their dinner plates, and I think it's time that they either acknowledge their lack of consumer care and start making up for it.......OR BE BOYCOTTED!!!

I've already started to boycott Warner. I will not buy another product with the Warner label until I see an improvement on how they are releasing their TV series, or finally release ""Twilight Zone-The Movie"". I strongly suggest to Warner that if they cannot handle their product properly, that they give the product to a company that CAN!!! And that goes for MGM/Sony as well!

And I want to give credit where credit is due. Even though the Paramount series are rather high priced, I think they are doing an excellent job with the Star Trek series', and am very happy with their releases of The Andy Griffith Show and Hogan's Heroes, among others that aren't as highly priced as the Trek series. 20th Century Fox is doing an excellent job with M*A*S*H. CBS DVD/Image did a great job on the 80's TV version of The New Twilight Zone and Universal is doing a fantastic job giving us the classic 70's shows Adam-12 and Emergency!

The afore mentioned companies are leading by example. MGM/Sony and Warner Brothers better start learning something from them about quality control and not treating their consumers like a bunch of blithering idiots!",1140912000,8,3855,4.697777777777778

All though not as exciting as the first box set, there's still some real classic episodes in this collection. (Fair warning: The second season box set is only 17 episodes long while the first set has a healthy 32 episodes) Some of the great episodes within this box set include ""I, Robot"" featuring Leonard Nimoy, ""The Invisible Enemy"" with Adam West, ""Cry of Silence"" with Eddie Albert, and probably one of the all time best episodes ever, ""Demon With a Glass Hand"" featuring the all time favorite re-occuring Outer Limits actor Robert Culp and written by the award winning science fiction author Harlan Ellison.  My all time favorite episode is in this set, and that's the 2 part episode, ""The Inheritors"" featuring a very young Robert Duvall.  It's worth the price for that episode alone.

And all while the federal government watches powerless to stop them as they construct their project behind an invisible force shield, struggling with the morality of what they are doing, while waiting for their leader to arrive with a car full of kidnapped children.  The dialog is smart, quick, and intelligent and touches a part of you inside that not too many episodes did.",1140652800,5,1893,4.896875
1899297,3,B00009Y3RE,"Soldier - **** (Four stars out of five.)  Michael Ansara plays a soldier from the future, Lloyd Nolan a linguist who tries to communicate with him.  Pretty strong opening salvo, with an intelligent script from Harlan Ellison.

Cold Hands, Warm Heart - ***.  The inimitable William Shatner stars as an astronaut returned from Mars with a bad case of the shakes, nightmares involving a giant Martian carrot, an extreme need for heat, and ultimately a `whole blood transfusion.'  Something is amiss when Shatner's acting salvages anything, but this one rides his back - just barely - over the line.

Behold Eck! - *. Behold the trough this series seemed magnetically drawn to.  Louie Elias plays a brainy eye doctor with some specially ground lenses that allow him to see Eck, or `the unnamed monster,' from what I assume is the 2nd dimension.  Question - If a creature is of only two dimensions, how is it that he grows a three dimensional eye?  And wouldn't popping your eye out of your skull hurt, no matter how many dimensions you pop it out of?

The Expanding Human - *.  Hog-ties an updated Jekyll & Hyde theme to `consciousness expanding' experimentation.  Way more silly than thought provoking.

Demon with a Glass Hand - *****. The second Harlan Ellison script is one of my favorites, and the reason I sought out this disk in the first place.  I remember watching this episode years ago, before I was 10, and it stuck with me.  Robert Culp plays a warring visitor from the future - future warriors traveling in time must have been a favorite theme of Ellison's - who has a glass hand that's missing three fingers.  The glass hand is a computer, and the missing digits are needed to tell Culp what happened to the 70 billion people on future Earth who vanished.  Naturally, there's a clutch of baddies after him.  Well done and thought provoking.

Cry of Silence - *. An embarrassment.  Eddie Albert, June Havoc, and Arthur Hunnicutt battle a desert full of Russian thistle, salt wort, and various other murderous tumbleweeds, as well as a barrel full of frogs.  The best line, uttered by an exasperated Eddie Albert at one point - `Anyone with six drink in him could write this kind of junk.'  So true.

The Invisible Enemy - **.  War hero Adam West and crew travel to Mars to find out what, or who, killed the last clutch of Mars' explorers.  For a sci-fi series, this one doesn't get the basics right.  West and crew walk around helmet-less, in shirtsleeves.  Colonization, after we clear out the invisible enemy, is going to be a snap.

Wolf 359 - ***.  Scientist Patrick O'Neal uses a chunk of interstellar rock to create his own world in the lab, with predictably eerie results.  As often happens, a great premise steadily loses steam and by the end of the show you're wondering what the heck happened.

 No comment on I, Robot.  The scratch-free, smudge-free, glistening disc 2/side A refused two play the last two title tracks, although the first two tracks played fine.

  The Inheritors, Part II - ****.  Missed part one. Federal agent Robert Duvall and men are chasing a super-intelligent vet who's assembling the fixin's for a spacecraft and showing unseemly interest in some selected young people.  Even though I'd missed the first part I caught on pretty quick.  Most of these shows are heavily padded, and The Inheritors is no exception.  Although I should have figured it out, the end surprised me a bit.  Has kind of a nice, Day-the-Earth-Stood-Still feel to it.

Keepers of the Purple Twilight - ***.  Robert Webber plays a gilly alien scouting out the Earth for nefarious purposes.  Never a good thing, as Ikar (Webber) can attest, for an alien to drain a human of his emotions and take them on as their own.

 The Duplicate Man - **.  A megasoid, an alien with a chicken's head, a yeti's body and a kangaroo's tail, wreaks havoc in the semi-distant (1986) future.

 Counterweight - *.  A group of experts, anthropologists and the like, find their worst nightmares coming true during a mock inter-planetary space flight.

 Brain of Colonel Barham - **.  Typical `brain-in-a-jar' story.  Brilliant young army officer with a bad attitude and failing body is de-brained.  Brain is put in a jar, hooked up to a computer, ignores its job as adjunct to the Mars colonization exploration team.  Instead wreaks general havoc, concentrating its evil on the colonel's pretty ex-wife and her new, handsome psychologist friend.

The Premonition - **.  Time stops for a married couple moments before a near-fatal crash occurs.

The Probe - **.  After flying through the eye of a hurricane, plane crash survivors find themselves in a strange, sterile, hostile place.  Last episode of the series.

 Falling somewhere between the original The Twilight Zone and cheesy 50s-era science fiction movies - the cheap ones - The Outer Limits, at least the second season episodes, fails miserably in comparison.  When the material is good, for instance in the Harlan Ellison scripted `Soldier' and `Demon with a Glass Hand,' they're something special.  Unfortunately, there's too many monsters in silly costumes, too many stories that go nowhere, too much of Eddie Albert death match wrestling a hunk of sagebrush.  Good science and speculative fiction is supposed to fill us with awe and wonder.  Rod Serling did it right, with numbing regularity, with The Twilight Zone.  The only wonder this set left me with was wondering how The Outer Limits made it through eighteen episodes.  A grudging three stars for this set, mainly because nostalgia counts for something and a few, a precious few, of the episodes are keepers.",1139616000,10,5621,4.826862539349423

1899310,1,B00009Y3RE,"I enjoy the old sci-fi shows like Outer Limits.  In many cases, these shows contain some of the earliest instances of certain ideas ever seen on TV.  (Naturally, they appeared in written fiction years earlier, but this is TV, which is usually 20 years behind written science fiction.  So one makes allowances.  :^)

For example, the episode ""The Invisible Enemy"" has what is probably one of the first appearances (if not THE first appearance) of a ""sand monster"" on TV.  Sand monsters now show up regularly in skiffy and fantasy shows.

Sadly, the production quality of this DVD set is just not up to par.  Disc 2 of my first set had major problems.  ""I, Robot"" and ""The Inheritors Part 1"" pixellated and froze.  Fair enough, I thought.  Snail mail had not been kind to the set, and it had arrived with 2 discs loose and scuffed pretty severely.  I exchanged the set.

Now I'm on my second set, and ""I, Robot"" and ""The Inheritors Part 1"" once again pixellate and freeze, even worse than the first time!  I did a little research, and discovered that lots of people have trouble with these episodes.  This set is also going back.  This time I'm getting a refund.

Whoever is handling quality control on these discs is obviously not doing their job.  I'll give it a few months (or maybe a year) and try again.  Maybe I'll get lucky next time and receive a functional set of discs.",1128902400,11,1377,4.524390243902439

1899312,4,B00009Y3RE,"Nostalgia for these episodes can be great but there is no need to go around nostalgia to review them because these episodes stand up on there own. Even episodes with silly plots or some bad acting or effects ... they still come across as time travelers in their own right... coming to us from another time, they are actually quite beautiful to look at, always amusing, and often brilliant, thought provoking and compassionate.

The review below is fair but anyone who could give SOLDIER 5 out of 5 and DEMON WITH THE GLASS HAND only 3 out of 5 definately has something screwed on backwards. DEMON is by far one of the best episodes, better than SOLDIER (which is great too but nowhere near as good as DEMON. DEMON will ROCK YOUR WORLD).

So anyway you can see people have different opinions but if you aren't completely married to the fast pace of today's media world, then these programs will definately take you from the deepest inner mind to the outer limits. Enjoy.

FYI Watch Soldier and then Demon With The Glass Hand back to back and then you'll know why Cameron had to cop to taking the idea for The Terminator from Harlen Ellison and these two episodes (A credit for Ellison was added to the Terminator after a legal battle).

One important problem... the DVD menu forces you to look at the chapter stops and pictures from each episode before watching. What MORONIC STUPIDITY!!! The fun is in watching each episode come out at you. If you can then I suggest you click your episode and look away and click play again. Then you can enjoy the episode as it comes. (If you need a reminder of which episode your looking for then go ahead and look at the chapter stops, but they should have given us the option.",1128038400,5,1714,4.501607717041801
1899313,5,B00009Y3RE,"Although the reputation of Outer limits rests on Joseph Stephano and the first season, the fact is many (and I mean MANY!) season one stories were more interesting than entertaining, with good ideas but not fully realised as scripts. Episodes like O.B.I.T and The Production and Decay of Strange Particles regularly bored me to the point of curing insomnia, as they were really a half hour plot padded with merciless, banal chatter to the length of an hour.

The second season boasts a team of writers such as Harlan Ellison, Jerry Sohl, Ib Melchior and Seeleg Lester, not to mention stories adapted from the likes of Clifford D Simak, and frankly, they're better! They seem to be fully realised science ficiton stories, rather than a quirky or interesting idea which is being dragged out to painful lengths.

The Soldier, which inspired The Terminator, is a stunner, thanks to a great plot and a superb performance from Michael Ansara. Demon with a Glass Hand is Ellison's masterpiece and Robert Culp delivers a great performance, in perhaps the best ever Outer Limits ep.

Counterweight is an interesting idea about a space flight simulator testing the first crew of regular people and an alien intelligence which awakens their fears and obsessions.

The Premonition, which surely inspired the classic ""Timelash"" episode of Gerry Anderson's UFO series, is a gripping time-freeze tale about a test pilot trying to save his little girl from impending death.

Wolf 359 is eerie and strange and a little too opaque, with a creature whose motives are never explained, but the central concept is quite good.

I, Robot is effective, Cold Hand, Warm Heart is not bad and they boast Kirk and Spock themselves, Shatner and Nimoy. The Inheritors features Robert Duvall and The Invisible Enemy is an involving space adventure despite the lead role in the questionable hands of Adam West, who actually does quite okay in the part.

So, while it lacks the way out monsters of season one, (which have dated badly anyway) and the stylised camera work and music, season two is actually in the hands of writers who are in many ways, more engaging story-tellers than the legendary Joseph Stefano. It's probably sacrelige to say it, but the second season is actually better than the first and it's a tragedy that stupid scheduling killed it.",1128038400,3,2323,4.941025641025641

1899317,5,B00009Y3RE,"This is a little treasure for Sci-Fi fans.
Here's a short-list of what to expect:
1) Star power.  See William Shatner (Captian Kirk) and Leonard Nimoy (Spock) before they landed their Star Trek roles.
2) No-holds-barred, top nothc Sci-Fi names writing for the series.  Harlan Ellison, for example.  In terms of writing, the only thing more I could have hoped for would have been Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and Steven King-- and the time machine they would have needed to have been part of this project that was before their time.
3) It's Not Twiighlight Zone.  This is the series that was the edgier, less-successful contemporary of Rod Serling's ""Twighlight Zone"".  In some ways, it's easy to understand that this series was trapped by its own format.  While The Twighlight Zone could explore outside the strict Sci-Fi genre (much as the X Files do), Outer Limits was stuck firmly in SciFi.  However, where TTZ stayed away from social fireworks, TOL aims straight at issues that were volatile in their day, with the notable exception of feminism, which is entirely absent.
4) Landmark, interestingly-aging plotlines.  You'll see discussions about whether drugs are a way to access a higher reality, and debates about whether artificial life is human.  You'll see Utopianism.  You'll see blacks given prominent, intelligent roles (rare, in the days before Star Trek had the first onscreen interracial kiss).  Yet, you'll see women repeatedly thrust into demeaning roles.  You can see how these pieces fit nicely into their time period, with a distinct rift between then and now.  These're DISCUSSION PIECES, better than any coffee-table book.  Show'em at a houseparty, and talk about them afterward.
5) Now that Mystery Science Theater 3000 is off the air, where can you see cheesy, dated Sci-Fi special effects ?  Here.  It's disrespectful of the series' writing, to laugh at the technology & special effects, but genuinely, this adds a large dimension to your enjoyment (& discussion).
6) This is not to be compared with the recent HBO series by the same name.  This older series is vintage pre-60s with good writing and zero budget for special effects, while the later HBO TV series is a special effects fest, with markedly less-often-inspired writing.",1085616000,14,2263,5.072972972972973

This set is not worth the same as the first season if for no other reason than it has half the episodes.

I find it appalling the studio got everyone into buying the first season with a reasonable price, then figured they will all pay just to finish their set. Well at least in my case guess again.

1899319,3,B00009Y3RE,"--Episodes--Season 2--
(I consider 3 and above good, 2 or below poor.)
Soldier: 5/5 Off and running in Season 2. Despite how cheesy the outfit looks, this episode has a sort of undefined magic. Micheal Ansara should have won something for his portrayal of the soldier, I honestly believed he was a soldier from the future. Although, I never have understood the effect of ""the enemy"" being trapped, it looks odd even today. I often wished this script could have been reworked in which the Soldier never comes home with Kagen, I think it loses some of its believeability once he does. However, even here it has brightspots like Quarlo's interest in the cat Mcbeth, and the reason for the interest. Think-speak? Odd.
Cold Hands, Warm Heart: 2.5/5 This ep. has elements that make it watchable, particularly, Shats insistance on the keeping warm. I think this is a decent ep. that could have been better, barring better effects. I always laugh at the term ""Project Vulcan""... a precursor of things to come? This ep. is a great example of why Shat refers to himself as the Ham-o-saurus.
Behold Eck!: 1/5 Despite Eck! being a memorable character, well outside the usual gloom and doom of sci-fi, I find the story to be proposterous (um, a spectacle), yes, even for sci-fi. The ""building effect"" on the news looked neat-o though:) A glaring problem with this ep. stems from Season One's ""Galaxy Being"", that is similar to this but much, much better. Just watch that instead.
Expanding Human: 2.5/5 Not a bad ep. but considering the cast it should have probably been better. It's nice to see James Doohans suspicious wit and sarcasm formulating in this. I think this ep. was fair but not one I'd watch over and over, middle of the road. I wish James had a larger role, he is quite good.
Cry of Silence: 3.5/5 I really like this one. It has a forboding quality to it that still is effective today. And oddly enough this ep. opens with city-boy Eddie Albert wanting to give it all up to become a farmer... sound familiar? His wife in this gives a fine performance as a frightened woman just wishing it would all end, convincing but not overdone.
Demon With a Glass Hand: 3/5 I like Robert Culp in this quite a bit, unfortunately, the story, even though it's Ellison isn't very good. I am probably in the minority here, but I think this ep. is average at best. This always seems to come off like a ""pilot"" for a new series, similar to how Assignment Earth for Star Trek does, probably because Culp is so darn good. Tell it to the hand!
Wolf 359: 4/5 Great Sci-fi. This is a finely balanced episode that is interesting and yet doesn't try too hard. The effects are of coarse primitive, but the point is made. I like the cast, they are also well balanced and believeable. The subject matter is interesting but this show loses a point for slow pacing. Looking through the scope at the created world was quite effective.
I, Robot: 4/5 Even though I give this show a pretty high rating, I think the cast is primarily strained and wooden. The high rating is given in large part to the character Adam Link. The odd tone in his voice and the look of sentimentality may be all robot, but to me Adam is more human than most of the actors. Nimoy is fair in this, but nothing terribly memorable, a bit overzelous.
The Invisible Enemy: 1/5 There are few Outer Limits with no redeeming qualities, IMO, this is close to being one of them. Typical, predictable, and stale are words that come to mind. Adam West heads a cast of astronaughts that refer to women as ""dames and broads"". The rocket effects appear to be 50's quality and even though there is some tension near the end, it's far too little, too late.
The Inheritors 1&2: 5/5 I struggle with this dual episode despite the score. I think it is superbly acted, wonderfully directed, but what worries me is the conclusion one draws from the ending. Are we to understand that people can only truly be happy if they are ""normal""? Even though I ponder the conclusion, I marvel at the great acting along the way, probably the best. Great story, also. MGM should have seen fit to put these on the same side of a disc however!
Keeper of the Purple Twilight: 3.5/5 In terms of dialogue, there's quite a bit to like here. Some meaningful exchanges about the meaning of love and life seem heartfelt. The acting is more than adequate although I must say the rubber suit costumes are again, just not very good. Even in '65 they were probably barely passable, and now they seem silly and are a bit distracting. Certainly, not the worst ever, but the immobile eyes and mouth take away from the reality of fantasy greatly.
Counterweight: 2/5 A show of this nature lives and dies depending on how well defined the individual characters are drawn up ( as in 5 Characters in Search of an Exit 5/5), in this case, it's a true failure. I think a redeeming factor is the soaring ""vocal"" score that gives it a dreamy essence, the odd ending of the reintroducing of characters, and a few other small factors, but this show just lacks any insight or punch.
The Brain of Col. Barham: 1.5/5 Some of the Outer Limits fail because of one simple reason; they are attempting to perform concepts 40 years ago that couldn't even be attempted now, when that unravels, the jig is up. They should have at least draped the set in a futuristic aura in hopes of pulling this off. On top of that the actors never seem to deliver lines with any sort of spontenaity. The sets aren't even half bad, but the concept is ridiculous, and the characters are hollow and vague.
The Premonition: 2.5/5 Ahhh... the obligatory ""freeze frame"" episode, which actually exceeds expectations in so far as the effect. Some really clever uses of the technique actually one ups the mighty TZ uses (not the picture stills though). However, having said that, this story has many, many holes. Far more than I could expound on here. And I never have understood why the title was used. The term ""premonition"" really doesn't apply in this case. Fair acting abounds, but doesn't cover the huge plot holes. Ok, I can't resist, why not tie the childs feet around the bike? Tying the bike in some way would have been far easier. Too easy? :)
The Duplicate Man: 3.5/5 There's quite a bit to like about this one. The sets, props, and feel are just right for the subject matter. The acting is quite good, the plot is interesting, and the payoff is rewarding. Had this been a typical monster hunt it wouldn't have worked. The Megasoid is as amusing as it is menacing and for a creature that is so ""evolved"" it isn't very bright. I would have liked to see this ep. as a two parter like The Inheritors, but as it stands, it's well crafted. For a series that had to cut corners on costumes, I'm surprised an attempt wasn't made to show the creatures as little as possible, it would have helped.
The Probe: 2.5/5 Not really out with a whimper or a bang. Nice cast, nice acting jobs all around, but the mood is quite sterile and ineffective. The concept of this last episode is interesting but the direction never rises above ordinary The ""germs"" design seems to be a pre-Horta from Star Trek.
Wrap-up:
Still, in spite of all the hokey props, there lurks delicious camera angles, glorious sound, odd lighting, and most importantly, a fun sense of adventure that has all but since evaporated from the airwaves. In spite of the 3 stars, I cannot reccommend this set enough. Not because I'm caught like ""the enemy"" in the never-never, but because I'm trapped in a time period that uses ""effects"" to convey awe and mystery instead of imagination. The Outer Limits is a welcome look back at a future gone by.",1071619200,25,7653,4.550398839738941
1899320,3,B00009Y3RE,"Okay, so the second season of ""The Outer Limits"" was not up to par with the first season which is why it died in mid-season, but there are still some gems there. Yes, this collection is bare bones, no extras, no nothing, just 17 episodes. And some of those episodes are really painful to watch, especially considering how great season one was of this classic TV series.
Production is down along with the budget. Most episodes look extremely cheap. Season one made up for low budgets by making good use of unusual camera angles, close-ups, and film noir techniques. Most episodes in season two just have a flat look with sleepwalking direction and acting. But, if you are a die-hard like me, you'll bite the bullet and buy this over-priced set. At least it completes the collection. I still like the sand shark episode with Adam ""Batman"" West and ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart"" with William Shatner's unique over-the-top acting style.

1899321,5,B00009Y3RE,"I have a long obsessive appreciation for this show. My claim that it has been a foundation for all the science fiction tv and films to come has been vindicated by the splendid reviews that both DVD sets have received by other customers. I am sure this is attributed in part to David J. Schow's book ""The Outer Limits Companion"". There is really nothing I can add to commend this show further but I would like to suggest an idea for Harlan Ellison. Release ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" as a Computer Game! It has the ideal plot for such a product if you really think about it. Robert Culp could even do the voice of Trent. This show has been ransaked for ideas for the past four decades. It is about time a new product is released in a format that truly represents the show as it was but with the participation by the viewer. Infinately a better idea than the new nineties ""Outer Limits"". I am sure all dedicated fans of this show feel exploited by the price of the final seventeen shows in comparison to the previous set. Have you considered this spin on the whole matter? MGM/UA had an opportunity to sell an entire old series on a new format. The fans are ecstatic. We buy the first package. Then we are impulsed to write a review. MGM/UA are then ecstatic that the product which they pumped out has such a good response and a big following. They know how to price the next set.

1899322,4,B00009Y3RE,"The original 1960s version of THE OUTER LIMITS is arguably one of the best science-fiction series ever created for television.  The writing was fresh, innovative, and literate, and episode plots were often inspired by the real-life scientific and social issues of the day.  True, the show's limited budget sometimes resulted in cheesy special effects, but the producers and their crews worked hard to ensure that the stories were of the highest quality.  Even though the series lasted only two seasons, the intelligence and overall quality of the program have helped it to remain an influential sci-fi favorite for more than 40 years.
This set of DVDs contains the entire second season of THE OUTER LIMITS, which originally aired during the first half of the 1964-1965 TV season (it was, alas, cancelled in mid-season).  Although a lot of die-hard fans feel that network meddling resulted in the inferior quality of several episodes from this season, there are many other ardent fans who feel that, in spite of the network meddling, many of series' best and most memorable episodes are from the second season.  Whatever the case may be, there are definitely some standout episodes in Season TWO.  Some of those include:
In ""Soldier,"" a warrior from the future, armed with advanced weaponry and psychologically programmed to be the ultimate combatant, is transported back to the 20th-century.  Hot on his heals is an enemy soldier, also armed to the teeth and programmed for combat.  This episode was written by award-winning author Harlan Ellison, and it ended up winning a 1964 Hugo award.  It would later serve as the inspiration for the 1980s blockbuster THE TERMINATOR, a fact that the film's director and writer, James Cameron, denied but that Ellison proved in court.  As a result of the lawsuit, Cameron was required to change the film's credits to acknowledge Ellison's contribution.
""Demon with a Glass Hand"" is the story of a man who travels back through time in an attempt to save the human race from being annihilated in the future by extraterrestrials.  Unfortunately, the man has no clear memory of his identity or his mission--and the aliens are hot on his trail.  Another from the pen of the venerable Harlan Ellison, this one earned an award from the Writers Guild of America.
""Wolf 359"" is the story of a scientist who creates an Earth-like planet, complete with a miniature human-like population, and accelerates the evolutionary process in an effort to study and better understand humankind's past and future.  But as one might expect, things don't work out quite the way they were planned.
In ""I, Robot,"" small-town scientist & tinkerer Charles Link creates the first artificially intelligent robot.  When Dr. Link is killed in a freak laboratory accident and the robot is accused of his murder, Dr. Link's daughter brings a famous and controversial attorney out of retirement to defend the robot.  This episode was remade in the 1990s for the new OUTER LIMITS anthology.
A myriad of actors and actresses who would later go on to become big stars appeared in various second-season episodes.  This estimable group includes William Shatner, James Doohan, Robert Culp, Arline Martel, Eddie Albert, Adam West, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Duvall, Ivan Dixon, Edward Platt, Michael Constantine, and Anthony Eisley.
There have been alot of complaints circulating regarding the picture quality of this DVD set, and it is true that there seems to have been little, if any, work done in the digital restoration of these wonderful sci-fi teleplays.  This is unfortunate, because some of the episodes do show minor amounts of scratches, spots, and other wear artifacts.  However, these are DVDs, so the picture quality is still quite acceptable and does not include any of the tape-noise artifacts or signs of tape wear that consumers suffered with the previously released VHS editions.
It does seem a bit unfair of MGM that the difference in price between this DVD set and the first-season set is so diminutive.  There are 32 episodes in season one but only 17 in season two, so it seems that the minuscule price difference merits some sort of bonus features or extras on the second set.  Sadly, this is not the case, meaning that with the second set, you get less bang for your buck.  Ardent fans of the show will buy the second season anyway, of course, but others may think twice.
All in all, Season Two of THE OUTER LIMITS makes a fine addition to the DVD collection of any serious science fiction fan.
(NOTE: The four-star rating does take the non-restored picture quality into account, as well as the fact that this DVD set is overpriced when compared to the first-season DVDs. Otherwise, this set would earn a five-star rating.)",1068422400,4,4739,4.980988593155893
1899323,3,B00009Y3RE,"I've been hoping that MGM would release the 2nd season, ever since Season 1 came out in 2002. I was ecstatic when I found out that it was being released. Unfortunately, the package completely turned me off because of the placing of the two episodes of The Inheritors on two different sides of the same disk. What makes this even worse was that there was room on side 2 to keep the two episodes together. I wa shoping to get rid of the VHS copy of the Inheritors that I have, but now that won't happen.",1066953600,,501,4.229166666666667
7994609,3,B00009Y3RE,"This show scared the crap out of me as a kid, in fact I wasn't allowed to watch it after the first episode I ever saw ""The Probe"".  Watching it again all these years later it seems s l o w and dull.  It really is a half hour show - a Twilight Zone format - but with the episodes stretched to an hour.  Very few episodes really need the whole hour.  One of those shows from the past that should be seen, but compared to what came later and even some of its contemporaries it comes up short.  Even ""The Probe"" I couldn't believe how much of it is just... nothing happening at all.",1525478400,,578,3.991304347826087
