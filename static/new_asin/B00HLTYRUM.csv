6171375,4,B00HLTYRUM,"Older films from when I was in college with the sorority girls.  Was kind of nostalgic to look back on the older porn flicks, and they at least attempt to have a story line, weak as most of them are.  Watch it with your sweetie!",1403913600,8,228,4.044444444444444

6171391,3,B00HLTYRUM,"Avoid the Drive-In Collections are all pretty poor in just about every respect ...Check out the Peekarama series which are as a whole of much better quality and better then most hard core flicks at a very good price for double sex features. Which show all, but not kinky as a whole, fair reproduction. Not a tease as many, but non-stop action,and often the actors are really enjoying themselves ...can be rough and crude yet still sensitive at times

Better then most current x rated type films which seems more artificial and twisted",1418774400,2,534,4.741935483870968

6171394,5,B00HLTYRUM,"2 thoroughly enjoyable movies here, neither of which I was previously familiar with. However, I AM familiar with Leslie Bovee.......she's the reason I purchased this DVD in the first place. God, was this babe was HOT back in the day! Thank you ""Vinegar Syndrome"" for re-creating some very pleasant memories for me. 70's porn RULES!",1408233600,2,331,5.036363636363636
6171395,5,B00HLTYRUM,"Fantastic 70s action shot on film in Hollywood.  First film has a lot of good scenery around town, as well as plenty of good adult scenes (although many are with the same guy).  Some of the action is hit and miss, get what you get, with money shots appearing a little suddenly, but it's all fully explicit with no deliberate annoying cuts like today's adult cinema tends to be riddled with.  Second film starts right away with a lot of really hot action with the girl in the mirror loving herself.  She's equally seductive by herself as with partners and again, all fully visible at least as far as camera and editing.  Some of the guys aren't that great though and that's a pity, a bit of a distraction... but there are many hot babes in this who look like *women* and not little girls (although back then everyone looked more sophisticated imho).  Again, it's 70s stuff so there's very little grooming below the belt but the ladies all have beautiful feathered hair and seem quite passionate in their performances (without getting overdone and fake about it).  I'm quite pleased with this purchase!",1404950400,31,1100,4.668393782383419
6171396,5,B00HLTYRUM,"I wasn't sure if the dvd was worth buying since I already own the something weird video DVD version of Deep Roots. Man I'm glad I did,The Vinegar Syndrome DVD looks so new and beautifully restored I can't help wonder how the other DVD's by this company must look like. I just might get a few more.",1404864000,13,297,4.228070175438597

8633382,4,B00HLTYRUM,"During V.S. black Friday sale bought a good size amount of there releases
This Peekarama Big 2 ""Unit Show! i wasn't sure about getting but, the price was cheap
The dvd itself is Region Free
Both films are also scanned in 2k from the 35mm archival prints

Deep Roots  (1978)
Originally on the home video market first on VHS,
It did have a dvd release put out September 2014
Under the Deep Roots Triple Feature  distributed by Alpha Blue Productions
Alpha Blue Productions mostly deal in vintage/classic films
I honestly doubt they actually put any time and money into doing any type of print restoration though

Cast Include: Jesse Chacan,  Liz Renay,  Anita Sands,  Mary Swan, Toni Bell, Debbie Love

A Native American man rides his chopper bike off the reservation to L.A. In search of the good life. One of only 2 films featuring the amazing Anita Sands, a freckled bra busting redhead that ranks as one of the sexiest obscure starlets of all time!
A film like this would never be made now in this day and age what makes it worth checking out would be
Anita Sands and the Marilyn Monroe knock-off beauty Liz Renay
Liz's life story is super interesting for this time period she is in a sense way to high quality to being doing these type of films

Starlet Nights (1978/1982)
Also first debut on the home video market on VHS
the film is in the Deep Roots Triple Feature by Alpha Blue Productions

Cast Include: Leslie Bovee, Candy Nichols, Tyler Horne, Jesse Chacan, Monique LeBare, Sandy Larado

Leslie Bovee stars as a sex starved Hollywood actress in this big budget film filled with inventive sex.
This release it's a oddball update of Snow White in late 1970's Hollywood

Both films look extremely good for there age
I doubt will see either film look this good
This is a solid release overall and a real must for classic/vintage 35mm collectors  8.8/10",1482364800,,1857,4.6422018348623855
