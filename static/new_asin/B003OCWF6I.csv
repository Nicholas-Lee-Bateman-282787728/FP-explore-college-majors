4161934,4,B003OCWF6I,"""The Losers,"" based on the Vertigo/DC Comic, is a rollicking, fast-paced action-comedy film that seems to enjoy itself as much as it wants others to enjoy. Which is not hard since it's extremely entertaining.

The Losers are a Special Forces team led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, famous from being ""The Comedian"" in ""The Watchmen"" movie. His Clay is a tough, no-nonsense type that has a firm grip on his conscience. So when his team is on a CIA-led mission to pinpoint an airstrike location, and children show up unexpected, he puts his and his team's life in jeopardy to rescue them. The ensuing events make the team international scapegoats. Faking their deaths, the team waits to plan its next move when Clay meets Aisha, who knows who they are and offers them revenge on the CIA official named Max responsible for their plight.

The rest of the film follows the team and its twisty, turvy path of vengeance. Morgan channels the roguishness of The Comedian into a decidely more likable and sympathetic character. Zoe Saldana, who plays Aisha, has the appropriate air of toughness, vulnerability, and mystery to fuel her character. The rest of the team rounds out with Idris Elba as Roque, the second-in-command, Chris Evans as Jensen, the silly jokester always coming on to women, Columbus Short as Pooch, who struggles with being thought of as dead as his wife is close to giving birth to their child, and Oscar Jaenada as the taciturn sniper Cougar. Jason Patric makes the most of his villainous turn as Max.

The movie is loud, boisterous, funny, exciting, and silly. It is also quite enjoyable.",1272067200,,1596,4.8388278388278385
4161935,3,B003OCWF6I,"Ok, so I've never read the graphic comics, I just like Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Zoe Saldana. At first when watching this in the theater the assault on the Drug Lord compound I couldn't but think God this director is a poor man's Tony Scott, as in the editing was fast, quick cuts, freeze fram sequences, slow motion shots, everything pretty fast pace, then it hit me  30 mins into the film, this so could have been directed by Peter Berg (The Kingdom, The Rundown)... all the while wondering if the Studio had asked Berg to direct and he said no and stepped aside to do other projects  just the style of the filming reminded me of The Rundown... then BAM! End Credits, Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt, Co-Producers or was it Screenwriters of The Losers, same guys who did The Rundown! that's why it felt so familiar and that is why this movie is a nice companion piece to The Rundown.

Anyways with that out of the way, this is a briskly paced, fun, high energy movie with cool characters, nice action sequences, nifty soundtrack, except my only problems, why I give it 3 stars.... Jason Patric as the baddie? He seemed out of place, maybe it's just me, and wish this coulda been an R, maybe could've shown more violence a tad more graphic, hope there is a Director's Cut DVD, felt for an 1Hr 30 mins, crammed a lot in. Don't know how faithful this is to the comics, but I liked it, Rogue Special Forces out to clear their name for something that they didn't do... wow sounds like the A Team, which by the way I am looking forward to seeing June 11th.
Anyways hope it does well in theaters and DVD sales to garner a sequel, the end does leave it open for The Losers to come back!",1272067200,,1678,4.337579617834395
4161936,5,B003OCWF6I,"""The Losers"" is great! This is how the story goes: Members of an elite U.S. Special Forces unit are sent into the Bolivian jungle on a search and destroy mission. The team -- Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch and Cougar -- find themselves the target of a lethal betrayal instigated from inside by a powerful enemy known only as Max. Presumed dead, the group makes plans to even the score when they're joined by the mysterious Aisha, a beautiful operative with her own agenda. Working together, they must remain deep undercover while tracking the heavily-guarded Max, a ruthless man bent on embroiling the world in a new high-tech global war.

The cast led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (as Clay) is great! The directing by Sylvain White (who also directed ""Stomp The Yard"" (2007) is great! The screenplay by Peter Berg (who also wrote the screenplay & directed ""Friday Night Lights"" (2004), he also directed ""The Rundown"", ""The Kingdom"" (2007), ""Hancock"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Battleship"" (2012) & James Vanderbilt (who also did the screenplay to ""Basic"" (2003, also produced), ""Darkness Falls"" (2003), ""The Rundown"" (2003, which was directed by Berg), ""Zodiac"" (2007, also produced) & the upcoming ""Spider-Man Reboot"" (2012) is great!

The cinematography by Scott Kevan (who also did the cinematography to ""Cabin Fever"" (2002) & ""Stomp The Yard"") is great! The film editing by David Checel (who also did the film editing to ""Stomp The Yard"") is great! The casting by Mary Vernieu (who also did the casting to ""Crazy Heart"" (2009), the upcoming ""The Killer Inside Me"" (2010), ""Machete"" (2010), ""Predators"" (2010) & ""Spy Kids 4: Armageddon"" (2011) & Venus Kanani is great! The production design by Aaron Osborne (who also did the production design to ""I Am Sam"" (2001) is great!

Predator"" (2004), ""Jumper"" (2008) & ""Zombieland"" (2009) is great!

This is a great action movie that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is a little different than most action films out there right now. This is fun and fast-paced.",1272067200,,2844,5.046808510638298
4161937,4,B003OCWF6I,"""The Losers"" has been released on the heels of ""Kick-Ass,"" a comic book adaptation that audiences love and will probably always prefer. That's a shame. ""The Losers"" is, in my view, a winner - vastly superior as an action spectacle, a comedy, a character study, and above all, a story. This means that, while it certainly revels in all manner of fun comic book violence, it also has the ambition to be about more than violence; we're engaged because we're actually being told something. I left the theater feeling not empty and sad, as I had with ""Kick-Ass,"" but energized, entertained, and satisfied instead. This is how the movies are supposed to make you feel, right? For the first time in what felt like ages, I was confident that I had gotten my money's worth.

Based on the comic book series created by Andy Diggle, ""The Losers"" begins in Bolivia, where we find five tough CIA agents on a mission to take out a ruthless drug lord at his compound. They are: Jake Jensen, a hacker (Chris Evans); ""Cougar"" Alvarez, a long-distance sniper (Oscar Jaenada); ""Pooch"" Porteous, the pilot (Columbus Short); William Roque, the second in command (Idris Elba); and the team leader, Franklin Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). When the mission goes wrong and ends in the death of twenty-five innocent children, our five men realize that they've been set up by a mysterious figure known only as Max and vow to have their revenge. They're no longer CIA - they're the Losers.

They've officially been declared dead in the U.S., leaving them stranded in Bolivia without money or a way to get home. Then along comes Aisha (Zoe Saldana), who repeatedly proves she isn't quite what she seems; she meets Clay as he dines on steak in a seedy dive, and although she comes onto him in the least subtle of ways, their retreat to his hotel room doesn't end the way one would expect. Long story short: She claims she knows where Max is and can get the Losers home. Clay is immediately taken with her. Pooch, Cougar, and Jensen are willing to go along with her. Roque, however, isn't convinced, nor is he sold on the idea of revenge against Max. All he wants to do is get out of the game and live the rest of his life.

And speaking of Max (Jason Patric), he never seems to be in the same place twice, always travelling around the world making deals with shady people for his own equally shady purposes. What is his scheme? Let's just say that it involves one of the coolest terrorist weapons ever conceived of for a comic book adaptation. How fitting for a man with the most extraordinary sense of humor, always with the sarcasm, the dry wit, and the homicidal tendencies (God forbid the wind should accidentally blow aside an umbrella if you're holding it over his head). Funny and oh so bad, Max is the most deliciously evil movie villain since Colonel Hans Landa from ""Inglourious Basterds.""

Great humor can also be found amongst the Losers, especially Jensen, who, despite not having seen her for some time, is devoted to his niece and her school's Soccer team. I particularly enjoyed a scene in which he must improvise a way to escape the security guards in a Miami office building; with a little help from Cougar, he pretends to have telekinetic abilities, which he says gives him the ability to shoot bullets with nothing but his pointed fingers. He seems to enjoy Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin',"" and so too does director Sylvain White, seeing as he strategically has it playing during some of the more intense actions sequences. You'd think it would be a horrible fit, but no - it's actually quite amusing.

And as for Clay and Aisha, not only are they a pleasure to look at, their subplot is also very intriguing, probably because both are troubled characters with goals in mind, neither able to reach them without the other one's help. I know it's an awfully overused critical observation, but it's true: Morgan and Saldana have great onscreen chemistry, not merely as love interests, but also as occasional adversaries. In some ways, that's even harder to achieve; it takes more effort for actors to fight well than to love well, probably because fighting is generally more realistic.

What fun this movie is. There aren't enough like them these days. Sure, you can spend your money on ""Kick-Ass,"" but I think you'd be doing yourself a great disservice. ""The Losers"" is proof that even comic book adaptations can successfully be more than mean and mindless depictions of violence. Yes, there's plenty of action, but there's also a plot, and it involves characters who are not only magnetic, but are also given some depth. Nowhere is this more evident than in the film's final sequences, both of which display a goofy sweetness I found very appealing. Obvious work went into the screenplay. Obvious work went into the whole film. When movies like this come around, it makes me wonder why many other comic filmmakers don't try a little harder.",1271980800,2,4926,4.722093023255814
4161938,4,B003OCWF6I,"I'm a huge fan of the comic 'The Losers' so I was a bit dubious when I heard when they were making a film adaption. I was even MORE dubious when I heard it was rated PG-13. While the film version of The Losers lacks alot of the intelligence and biting satire of it's source material it very much keeps the high-energy and colorful personalities which made the comic so much fun to begin with.

The story in this film version of The Losers is very much an adaption of the story 'Ante-Up' from the comic (the first six issues). Basically following a close-knit group of soldiers as they attack, rob and take revenge on the people who betrayed them (namely the CIA and a man known as 'Max') . There are alot of embellishments from the comic ranging from the mundane ( Pooch is ALOT younger, Aisha is more friendly, Clay never smokes) to the more obvious (no drug-running CIA, no connections to the Iraq war and the US war on terrorism). What we are left with is a very fun very wacky action film with some great use of locations and action set-pieces. Also this has one of my favorite opening and closing credit sequences with panels by the original comic artist JOCK (mostly taken straight from the comic).

The casting is perfect down the line with Chris Evans a stand-out as the scene-stealing Jensen. While the movie does lack alot of the 'name' actors of alot of comic book films (which is probably why it's getting ho-hum publicity and release) the Losers very much holds it's own from beginning to end and it's actors are having fun and making the most of it.

The DVD release of this film has a decent transfer and looks better than you'd expect on the small screen but the extras are lacking. I was hoping for some interviews with comics creaters Andy Diggle and Jock (they WERE brought onto the set at several points) but the only extra we get is a look at the film and cast with Zoe Saldana. It's a decent enought feature but this DVD deserved more.

So while this film version of the Losers isn't ideal for comic's fans (and the DVD is lacking in extras), it's a VERY fun movie in it's own right and at a short 98 minutes never wears out it's welcome. If you're looking for a fun popcorn flick action film with alot of excitment and laughs thrown in: look no further!",1271980800,,2276,4.399049881235155

The good news is that The Losers is actually better than The A-Team, which was loud, obnoxious and singularly unexciting.  The bad news is that The Losers isn't all that good of a film itself.

The main problem is with the casting.  While Jason Patrick makes for an excellent villain and Zoe Saldana is solid, none of the actors playing The Losers makes even the tiniest impression--including TV vet Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who I'm not personally a fan of.  But he's the only one of the good guy leads I even recognized--the rest of the actors are so unmemorable you could have them swap out parts from scene to scene and it's doubtful anybody in the audience would even notice.

The action isn't bad and The Losers would have been a perfectly acceptable straight to video action flick (it bombed in theaters) but if ever there was a movie that would have benefitted from an actual star or two in the leads, The Losers is most definitely one of them.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan comes across as a sort of poor man's Robert Downey Jr--he kinda sorta has the looks to be a movie star but lacks the charisma to be a lead and seems more like a natural born character actor.  The only thing I've ever seen him in where I was impressed by his acting was Texas Killing Fields, where he gave an uncharacteristically soulful performance.  But normally Jeffrey Dean Morgan is every bit the hunk of wood that he is here--and he's the one who's apparently supposed to be carrying The Losers.

Ultimately The Losers is a lot like the John Cena vehicle The Marine in that it's fun whenever the villains are onscreen but a drag whenever it focuses on the heroes.  The Losers is a decent enough time waster, but that's about it.",1466380800,,1976,4.522471910112359

4162090,2,B003OCWF6I,"The Losers

 It must be terribly difficult to turn a comic book concept into a movie that the adult public can enjoy.  The makers of The Losers didn't even try.  The only people who could enjoy this inept effort are grade school age boys who must use their scant allowance for the ticket money.  Its too bad too.  Good action movies with cool explosions are a lot of fun, if they are done with even half a brain.  Really, we only ask that half a brain is involved.  That shouldnt be too much to ask.
 The concept is perfectly all right for this sort of a film.  A group of commando type special ops troops is betrayed by a sinister mystery man manipulating things behind the scenes.  The commandos seek to have their revenge on him and to clear their good names in the bargain.  The script that tries to make this work is a pastiche of clichs and random acts of mayhem.  The good guys are often careful to not inflict collateral damage upon more or less innocent third parties, but just as often let it all hang out and let the bodies fall where they may.  It is nonsense.
There are so many impossible stupidities in the script that I cannot list them all.
 Many actors have been associated with projects that didn't work out in one way or another.  Few have better reason to lambaste their agents then the actors in The Losers.  Zoe Saldana was last seen in the fabulously successful Avatar, where she played a big blue cartoon creature.  Ill bet she wishes she could go back to Pandora.  She is, without a doubt, nice to watch, but she is wasted in this bad movie.  One of my favorite actors, Idris Elba, made famous by his role in TVs The Wire is much too good an actor for the movie.  He stands out like well he stands out in this mess.  Jeffery Dean Morgan, late of Greys Anatomy can act and do good work if the script calls for it.  The script does not.  You get the idea.
 The aptly named The Losers is rated PG 13 for comic book style violence.  It runs a scant one hr. 38 minutes  I gets only a single saw blade, and that only for the beauty of Zoe Saldana and a cool bit where a biz jet was blown up by a motorcycle.

4162094,4,B003OCWF6I,"A group of soldiers are in Bolivia where they are about to take down the head of a drug cartel. They've got the target site painted and the bomber pilot is on his way to destroy the target. Before this can become a bad attempt at a joke, they see that the henchmen are using kids as mules and are bringing them onto the site. The soldiers try to get the attack halted only to get coldly rebuffed by a guy who calls himself Max. Thus, they do what people who view kids as innocent and relatable when they need to be rescued by adult figures (a wrongheaded view, if you ask me) like adult figures to do - save the day and get the kids to safety inside a big helicopter that doesn't conveniently have enough room for the team of soldiers and the kids. Before things can end the way they want it to, Max calls in a attacker plane and has it kill the ""bandit""/helicopter and the people aboard it. Now, they are seeking revenge on Max for what he did. Fortunately, they just might get it when a woman named Aisha tells them what Max will do in Miami 97 hours from now and that she has enough power to get the team back into the U.S. and fund their operation as they see fit in exchange for being given Max himself. Come for the action, stay for the humor and downtime before the fight scenes kick in. That's where you get the most mileage. Guaranteed.",1430524800,,1345,4.176923076923077

4162125,4,B003OCWF6I,"A fair amount of reviews for ""The Losers"" comment that it felt too forced, too action-based, with little meat in it.

I'd like to disagree.

The first thing that needs to be said about this movie: it is based on a comic series. The stylistic and cinematic choices so often criticized were made to reflect that source material, and to that end, it did a great job. The director worked closely with the writers and artists involved with the comic; as someone who started with the comics, it was great to see the familiar elements represented in the film, without being alienating to those who only saw this side of it.

Further, the action sequences were choreographed in a very believable way. Rather than relying on heavy-handed stunts and explosions, the effects crew wanted to present realistic scenes that were still interesting. They also took the time to consult actual military personnel to make sure both the actors and their equipment were accurate to their professions.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. The action was intense without being overwhelming, broken up by scenes of humor and playful plot. The characters were enjoyable and easy to relate to, which made the ending really rough.",1417910400,,1204,4.916256157635468

There are no super heroes here, but that's part of what makes this so much fun. You believe it's possible there are real characters out there in the world like them. While all the actors are great, Chris Evans as Jensen is the real standout. I knew I had to own this movie when Evans starts singing Journey and a hilarious series of hijinks ensue.

It never looses a momentum or pace, it's through and through fun, but if you pay a bit of attention, you will see darker undercurrents and rather deep connotations. There is no pretense here, but that's why the depth of characters and the story comes through. Stellar performances from the cast, let's just single out Jeffrey Dean Morgan as a charming rogue leader of the marry band, and Chris Evans as an unexpected comic relief. Both of them deliver amazing performances with subtle undertones and expansive range of acting. Will someone please put Morgan in more intelligent dark humor action leads?

I like action, adventure, and comedy, this movie has all three, and while Chris Evans gets most of the good comedic lines, some of his cast mates get some too.

I've been a fan of Chris's for a while, and Zoe, but Jeffry Dean Morgan was a treat to watch. Its the first time I've seen him act, and he did it so well, I loved his character. I'd like to see him in a bang bang, shoot 'em up western, that would be a good movie.

As for Chris, love the humour, I would kill to see him and Jason Bateman do a movie together, that'd be some funny S+++.

Couple things I like about this movie, is there's no swearing, only one gratuitous semi sex scene, and it's just fun. On a scale of one to five on the fun meter, I give this a four and a half out of five.

I won't give anything away, but I'll tell you this, when one of the bad guys gets it in the end, you're actually happy, you're like, ""Yes, die you F'R!"" Horrible thing to say, I know, but hey, I didn't write the script.

4162170,4,B003OCWF6I,"I watched this movie because I was interested in the work of Chris Evans.  He's pretty popular after this second Captain America, you might have noticed.

So The Losers is a fun, action movie. Definitely worth your time, and the few dollars it costs for streaming. Honestly I couldn't help but think that I saw exactly the same plot carried out on an episode of the A-Team.  Which is not to say it was a problem, it just really stood out in my mind.  All the actors did a fine job.  Zoe Saldona is always good as the femme fatale.  She is able to walk the thin line between seductress, gal in need, and confidently holding her own.  She has always been able to convey through her character that while she needs help, she only needs it to fill her ranks - not to be saved.

Chris Evans was totally selling the confident goofy geek he can do so well.  While the comic relief was suppose to be spread between him and Pooch, Evans was really the one carrying the weight of it.

I would comment on the rest of the cast, but I don't really know much of their work.  The only other person I recognized was Idris Elba.  It was nice to see him pull of his role effortlessly, and it just proves what a wide well honed range the man has.

To be honest, this is a fairly cookie cutter type movie.  I realize that its based on a graphic novel, and that probably has a lot more nuance and style infused in it's pages.  But the movie didn't really have any true style to it.  Other then to say it was in the style of an A-Team television episode.  However, I would absolutely suggest this movie as being worth both time and money.  yes, it may be cookie-cutter, but well who doesn't like cookies?",1401926400,,1681,4.232704402515723

None of the actors take themselves too seriously, as is often the case in feel good action movies, and the over the top moments are filled with more wonderfulness than knee-jerk, ""really?"".  I understand I'm not giving much of the plot away, and that's purposeful. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is great in the role of leader of this special forces unit gone rogue (the ""good"" guys). Idris Elba is fantastic, but he's always great. I loved him as Luther and in Thor. My favorite character though, has to be Jensen played by Chris Evans of Captain American fame~the writing for his role is fun, funny and entertaining. I especially love the t-shirts he wears and his engagement with his niece's soccer team as the closing credits roll.

However, this is not the vehicle that will take him there.

Some engaging actors with nothing to do but act out a banal and undeveloped plot. I realize this is from a graphic novel but they spent the money to make it into a movie. Perhaps this was to pay his mortgage.",1392595200,,383,4.380281690140845

4162196,4,B003OCWF6I,"Fast-paced action, quick-witted humor, one gorgeous woman, and a few hot men equals one very satisfying movie. Bad guy Max is a bit bland at first, and would seem to be either a poor actor or inadequate direction, but as the movie progresses, Jason Patric's droll delivery couldn't be more perfect for a man convinced of his own intellectual superiority. All the major players are in top form, and though I find Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Clay to be far less-interesting than his (in)subordinates, that's only because the other characters are just so well-acted that the leading man's performance pales by comparison.

Columbus Short gives us family-man Pooch, who snarks with the team he's stuck by even when he'd much rather be home with his wife. Cougar doesn't say much, but Oscar Jaenada is convincing as the sociopathic sniper we're lucky chose to work with the white hats. Roque is a man on a hair-trigger, and the incomparable Idris Elba brings that tension to life with ease. Zoe Saldana is both mercurial and tough as mystery-woman Aisha.

The real show-stealer, however, is Chris Evans as tech specialist Jake Jensen. Whether singing Journey in falsetto, filling the silence with his rambling commentary, or pimping his niece's soccer team by wearing a Pepto-pink shirt, Jensen is the star of virtually every scene in which he appears, and scenes in which he is the intended focus are absolute perfection. From the second he strolls in wearing bright yellow bicycle courier attire until his unconventional escape via ""superpowers"", the entire scene at the Goliath office building is just one great moment after another.

Finally, despite being a movie (originally a comic) about betrayal and revenge, there's also a lot of focus on loyalty and morality. In fact, in the climactic confrontation, Max forces Clay to choose between revenge and ""the right thing"". Our heroes aren't perfect, but in the end, they make the best choices they can... well, except for 6-foot-and-built Jensen, who really should know better than to pick a fight with a woman bigger than he is.",1391126400,8,2072,5.017441860465116

I think it's probably because the story moves at good pace, the acting is good and the script is well written for something like this. The perfect balance of action and comedy. It was also nice, since, at the time, I wasn't familiar will allot of the actors in it so for me, it was nice to see some fresh faces.  Plus Jason Patric is awesome as the villain.

4162211,4,B003OCWF6I,"This is the story of a group of CIA special forces who have to pretend they are dead after being betrayed. It follows them from the betrayal through an adventure to try and clear their names. It leaves things well wrapped up but open enough for a sequel (which I would love to see, because this really was fun to watch).

I really enjoyed watching this movie. Its just a really fun popcorn flick. Lots of action and humor, just enough depth to the characters to really keep you interested. It is also a really fun cast.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a really good job of being the anchor of the team, both as the character's role and as an actor. Idris Elba is fantastic as Roque, the darker side of Morgan's Clay. Watching the two of them interplay is just fantastic.  Chris Evans is fantastic as Jensen (who is probably the best uncle ever--watch it and you will see what I mean). He just nails the character's wise cracking attitude (I have a certain fondness both for him and for wisecracking characters)

The plot rolls along at a pretty nice clip. There is plenty of action, but not to the point where it is only action, there is some really fun dialogue and some really great scenes that actually don't involve explosions. Chris Evans has a wonderful scene in an elevator that involves some quipping and an outfit change.

I enjoyed Zoe Saldana in this role as well, I prefer her with a bit more spunk, and she has it in spades here. I'm not entirely sure she and Jeffrey Dean Morgan were well matched though.",1384905600,,1512,4.444043321299639

Also, there are some startlingly sweet touches that humanize the fellows a bit. Most of the rest is by-the-book. Pretty girl Zoe Saldana going for the creakiest actor in the whole movie, and yes, he's the leader of the pack and her character has a good reason for it, but still -- ick.

The dialogue, especially, is very snappy; one witty, smartass line after another. (Even the Evil Henchman got smartass lines, and that made me gleeful, and - perhaps oddly - rather sympathetic to his character.)

If you want a takes-itself-seriously movie, this is REALLY not for you. If you want a good time and lots of laughs? It's very worth it!

(My one complaint is that the English subtitles miss some of the dialogue in places. It's never more than a word, maybe two, at a time, and not super common, but if that's a potential issue, now you know.)",1359936000,,641,4.556521739130435

4162275,3,B003OCWF6I,"Last night's bargain rack movie was ""The Losers"" DVD. It was one of these nonsense stories involving a death squad, the world's toughest woman, the CIA and a plethora of bad guys and took place in at least a half-dozen countries in the world. Lot's of major and some really spectacular explosions punctuated the story. I'd say the budget was probably pretty high. The action was fast and your mind was always trying to play catch-up and mine never did manage to do so. Here and there the story was actually funny, sometimes in a droll understated way. However, I would not consider it a comedy. Well, maybe it was a comedy considering the looseness of the plot and it's total improbability.

I notice a lot of little things in movies. This group of losers flits from place to place in the world on an instant's notice. However, wherever they go everything is completely laid out for them. They always have a car, for example, and it might range anywhere from an aging Pinto to a Hummer, or there's always a jet airplane or helicopter or something fueled and ready to go for them. Secondly, no matter where they go there's always a gun and machine-gun force of bad guys blazing away and trying to do them in. Well, the bad guys are always very bad shots so they mostly end up getting killed in a variety of creative ways and The Losers continue on with the ludicrous story. Do you like a realistic, believable movie or do you prefer unmitigated nonsense that is high action and somewhat entertaining. If it's the latter, then you'll probably enjoy this film.

4162276,4,B003OCWF6I,"THE LOSERS is one whale of a fun flick.  When a group of CIA black ops specialists get betrayed and then are presumed dead by the American government, it's time to kick some serious bad guy arse.  And the villain is Max (Jason Patric is a hoot), a maniac who will stop at nothing to sell a new doomsday weapon to the highest bidder.  The specialists pair up with a mercenary named Aisha (Zoe Saldana is worth a couple of wolf howls), whose motives for stopping Max aren't quite clear, and the group hatches its plot and goes into nonstop action.  Of course the action is over the top and approaches cartoon proportions, but again, it's so much fun.  When shoot-'em-ups really let the lead fly it's cinematic bliss for this immature hombre.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Chris Evans (who is another memorable character), Idris Elba, Columbus Short, and Oscar Jaenada play the wronged CIA specialists attempting to restore their reputations and even the score; this group has terrific chemistry and the locker room interactions are worth chuckles galore.  Yes, THE LOSERS is predictable and occasionally lame, but it's well done and the plot moves and the action is pedal-to-the-metal furious.  And the ending is entirely open, meaning a Losers II might be coming to a theater near you.  I'm game.

4162286,1,B003OCWF6I,"The Loser is absolute garbage as far as I'm concerned.

The beginning will have you convinced you're about to see a spectacular action flick when you see a jeep carrying children *barely* avoid a huge explosion and come crashing down a cliff, and as soon as the helicopter lifts the kids up in the air and explodes (which actually offers fairly emotional writing much to my surprise) you're probably thinking ""Okay, this is SURELY going to be awesome"" but... the excitement ends there and you have 90 more minutes of crappy writing left.

First of all none of the main characters are remotely interesting.  They try to be funny.  They're not.  They try to be smooth talkers.  They're not.  They try to be tough guys.  They're not.  They're nothing but major annoyances the entire time.  They're also incredibly generic and forgettable.

The writing is absolutely horrid.  I realize the Losers is intended to be a campy action film so I shouldn't take the writing seriously, but when it gets to the point that nothing on screen offers anything in the way of interest and that it's impossible to care about any of the fighting or plotline building segments, it's time to shut this film off.  I can't watch movies like these that offer nothing at all.  A movie that never should have been made, period.  I'm sorry.",1323475200,3,1311,4.713656387665198

So not having the background with the comic this is based off of, I can say this was an excellent film alongside the equally excellent movie that came out around the same time, the Expendables.  Both have comedy, action, great stars, all wrapped up in a fatastic story.  A military hero team like no other, definately worth watching, and especially nice on Blu-ray because even the special features are of the highest quality visual and audio.

4162290,4,B003OCWF6I,"Does this smack a little of The A Team? Yes, but only in the most cursory fashion.  The action starts out early and you get a sense of who these guys are and what makes them tick early on in the movie so you know what's going to be driving the story line.

It's a winning mix of revenge, justice and just settling scores with a guy who's definitely gone around the bend and lost sight of reality in his rear view.

After their group is sent in to take out a seriously bad dude, they try to abort the mission because the guy has a host of little kids in his house, using them to sell drugs for him and knowing that the little ones will be killed, they try to stop it but there's this guy on the line and he isn't part of the team or anyone they recognize.

The guys manage to rescue the two dozen kids from the house before it's hit with an air strike, but the crazy guy on the radio has other plans and he ends up taking down the helicopter the team is supposed to be evacuating in, but The Losers aren't on board and they are now officially dead.

Now comes the time for payback and settling the score and the team does what it does best, gather intel and hunt down their target.  Along the way they acquire an ally and a traitor until the final confrontation when they action sequences are phenomenal and the outcome is particularly rewarding.

Now I won't give away the ending, but they clearly have the intentions and have laid the groundwork for a sequel, which is great news because this movie was a whole lot of entertainment packed into an hour and a half.

I will suggest that you keep watching the movie as the credits roll at the end, because you'll find yourself getting some additional scenes that you might miss otherwise.

4162296,4,B003OCWF6I,"THE LOSERS is anything but. Created to appear like a comic book in motion, writers peter Berg, James Vanderbuilt and Andy Diggle have come up with a script that has defined some strong, unforgettable characters, outlined an all over the place story line, and managed to polish it all off with just the right amount of parody, humor, steamy scenes, and silly dialogue that makes the movie work.  It is a film highly dependent of pyrotechnics and special effects, but these also are pulled off in such a way that they, too, are entertaining an even set the audience to cheering.

The story comes across as a bit jumbled due to the many sites where the action takes place, but essentially it is the tale of a group of five men (CIA operatives) who in an attempt to save some children in a fated helicopter escape from a disaster in Bolivia instead are assumed dead when the report of the exploded helicopter reaches the US.  The five men toss their dog tags into the flaming ruins of the helicopter and thus become lost to the world.  The team is a talented and well trained unit and each of the members has a special identity and gift: Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is the leader (and womanizer), Roque (Idris Alba) is the brains, Jensen (Chris Evans) is the wildly funny guy, Pooch (Columbus Short) is the sensitive guy, and Cougar (&Oacute;scar Jaenada) is the sniper with the ever present hat.  The team (the Losers) becomes the target of a betrayal in dealing with one Max (Jason Patric) who is preparing the bomb to end all bombs.  Out of nowhere comes the mysterious Aisha (Zoe Saldana) who works her way into the group via Clay's attraction to her beauty.  But Aisha has her own agenda and the team joins her in uncovering and hopefully destroying the lethal Max who is planning global warfare.  There are unexpected twists in the plot and internal challenges to the team's structure, but it all comes round in the end.

Yes, this is yet another noisy action film with classy acting from not only the stars but from everyone in the large cast.  It is a hoot of an action thriller and hopefully this cast will be reassembled for a Part II in the future.  Grady Harp, August 11",1313971200,6,2177,4.542199488491049

On the surface, The Losers looks similar to that in terms of characters and plot, but I had no problem sitting through the entire movie and having a ball of a time.

I love the cast, which includes Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana and Chris Evans.
Have been a fan of Morgan's since Grey's Anatomy, and always find him a compelling actor. Here, he oozes sex appeal and looks cool shooting machine guns in a suit. George Clooney, eat your heart out!

Saldana, who usually annoys me, is actually likeable as the mysterious Aisha. Her scenes with Morgan sizzle, and she handles the bazooka like a pro!

Evans, who will appear in the summer blockbuster, Captain America, is also a big surprise. I've only seen him in the Fantastic Four films, where he came across as bland and smart-alecky. As Jensen, however, it became clear why he won the coveted role of Captain America.
There's a scene where he sings and dances to Journey's Don't Stop Believing, which is hilarious! Who knew he had a talent for comedy? :)

4162300,2,B003OCWF6I,"You remember the A-Team, right? They were ex-United States Army Special Forces personnel branded as war criminals for ""crimes they didn't commit."" The Losers is a lot like that.

Oh, there's different actors of course: the guy who looks like George Clooney (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the guy who looks like Ryan Reynolds (Chris Evans as Jensen), the angry African-American (Idris Elba), and a motley hodgepodge of other stereotypes (the Silent Sniper, the Guy With a Family, the Tough Hot Chick). They are all good soldiers who are also good at what they do, but when a smarmy rich villain (Jason Patrick as Max) tries to eliminate them by blowing up a  helicopter full of children, the team decides to disappear until the Tough Hot Chick (Zoe Saldana as Aisha) gets the old team back together again.

There are two good things about this movie.  One is Saldana, who steals every scene she's in.  Tough, emotionally wounded, and with a feline menace that she amply displayed in Avatar, Saldana makes everyone else look like a mumbling gorilla.  The other is Evans, who's miscast as geeky awkward type - he's too good-looking to be convincingly geeky and too quick-witted to be believably awkward, but he nails every scene. If the movie was just about these two The Losers would be winners.

But it's not.  Instead, we get a curiously overinvolved villain who shoots his minions when they make a mistake (yawn), a chief henchman who has little to do, a tone that veers from awful (kids blown to bits by a missile) to cheeky (Jensen hilariously fails to infiltrate the villain's corporate office) to unbelievable (THE SPOILERS: who knew sniping a motorcycle could cause it to fly over the head of the hero and smash into an oncoming airplane?). The Losers wants comic-book violence and sensibilities but frequently veers into R-rated territory.

The Losers also has grand ambitions of being the beginning of a franchise, so it wraps up exactly nothing: not the villain, not our heroes' plight, and certainly not anything we care about.  Dead children are unavenged, improbable weapons of mass destruction don't go off, and our compensation is seeing Max robbed on a bus.  It's a sad state of the action movie industry when the best we can hope for is that the rich villain takes public transportation.",1304035200,8,2295,4.874035989717224

It's hard not to like this one. We get a group fighting for Uncle Sam, only to discover that he can be very dirty indeed! This would be in the form of Jason Patric, who perfectly plays a CIA scumbag. Considering the nature and breadth of America's crimes (especially of recent), it's nice to see the empire being cast in a villainous light, even if this is a fun action movie. Patric even schemes to fake terrorism for his own purposes.
The cast gels very well, the performances strong all around. As a fan of the Boris Grishenko character in Goldeneye, I was delighted by the similar character here.

Now they want revenge, to clear their names, and be able to return home. Four of the men act in a silly fashion and are apparently not too bright. Their leader, a colonel, seems intelligent.

I love the acting and characterization.  Even though there are a lot of characters, they did a decent job of getting them across to the audience.  Again, the acting and dialogue was decent.

unfortunately, the plot was a touch on the thin side.  The villain is almost cartoonish in his depth and actions and that was to the detriment of the film (even though his performance was good).

I would have rated this film higher, but truthfully this action genre has a lot of good films in it like the Bourne Series, Transporter, etc and this film is not at that level by any stretch (no fault of the acting, script is just weak).

So, I had to give it 3 stars.  If you need an action flick to tide you over, this is not a bad selection.  It is okay, Zoe is hot, the guys are funny, acting is decent.",1294531200,2,823,4.292207792207792

--This review may contain Spoilers pertaining to the Losers, The A-Team and The Secret Window.--

I enjoyed this movie, it's comedic level did make me laugh or chuckle at times. It was entertaining, definitely watchable. Most of the characters were good, if half fleshed- which I think is ok for an action comedy like this.

 However, there are some really huge problems I had with it.

1. The plot is extraordinarily predictable. I suck at predicting movie plots. I didn't get that Mort was a schizophrenic in The Secret Window until the last scene where he starts talking to himself.
  So when I predicted the entire plot of The Losers within the first 6 minutes, you know its predictable.

2. The bad guy totally walked away unscathed in the end. How badass can this team really be if they don't even get the bad guy?

3. Unoriginal.
  It's a very similar plot as the A-Team, which was and AMAZING movie in my opinion. The Losers was almost like a severely more predictable, not-as-good ripoff of The A-Team. So, If you find yourself in front of your local Redbox, I would suggest picking The A-Team over The Losers, but if your just looking for a flick, the Losers will do the trick.

4162322,4,B003OCWF6I,"- Jensen (facing off against three armed security guards): ""As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states, 'Don't start none... won't be none.'""

When a covert Special Forces op in Bolivia goes horribly south and they get framed for the murder of 25 Bolivian children, the Losers go rogue. Of course, it simplifies things that they're believed to be deceased. Languishing in Bolivia, destitute in Bolivia, the Losers run into the stunning Aisha, and she's their ticket back to stateside and also the means to achieve get-back on the bent CIA spook who set them up (the degenerate's name is ""Max""). ""Suicide mission"" just might be understating things.

Comparisons to THE A-TEAM are inevitable (especially with THE A-TEAM remake coming out the same year), so I thought I'd mention that and be done with it. THE LOSERS is based on a comic book series off DC Comics' Vertigo line, which meant that it was a bit more edgy than your typical DC stuff. (Or maybe what I meant was that it didn't cater to the normal superhero sensibilities.) This story is adapted from the comic book's first arc ""Ante Up,"" which I barely recollect except that the cast does such a good job that I'm sort of compelled to unearth my old LOSERS comic books and re-read.

It really is all about the cast. The story works off that run-of-the-mill ""Let's Get Payback On That Bad Guy What Done Set Us Up"" theme. It's shallow storytelling and stocked with plot reverses and double crosses, with snappy edits and hi-octane, over-the-top action sequences. The shifts in locales come with blurring speed, the story definitely globe trots, and so there's a bit of that disorienting factor for the viewer (or maybe the story convolutes that much). But the cast fuels the story, stamps it with a sense of cool, crackles it with energy. The cast is entirely compatible with their just-us-guys camaraderie (which Saldana then folds herself into). Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the team's leader Colonel Clay exhibits a world-weariness, and I don't know if he achieves that thru acting or because he's stubbled for the entire film, but it works. The charismatic Idris Elba is Roque, the second-in-command, and he becomes the catalyst for one of the film's sub-plots. Roque calls Clay's leadership skills into question. Things go downhill when Aisha shows up because Clay has had this history for having the most suspect taste in relationships with da ladies.

Of all the folks here, the most highly profiled are Zoe Saldana and Chris Evans, and they get meaty roles. Zoe Saldana is talented and exudes the hotness of a thousand exploding suns. She plays Aisha, the volatile, assskicking operative who hooks up with the Losers because they share the same agenda (which is ruining Max's day, shortening Max's life). I thought Chris Evans was fantastic and often funny as Jensen, the Losers' resident wise-cracking comms & tech expert. Evans without a doubt garners the most dialogue; his patter is non-stop. His T-shirts are ridiculous. He faithfully roots for his little niece's soccer team, the Petunias. I particularly love his use of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" and then his telekinetic bit. Awesome.

We all know a good villain elevates the film. Sometimes I'm not sure what constitutes a good villain. The film's Big Bad, Max, is one of those sorts who doesn't really lift a finger, doesn't get his hands dirty. But Jason Patric plays Max in such a wicked condescending way that he steals pretty much all the scenes, especially when sharing those scenes with the stiff Holt McCallany (who plays his right hand man, Wade). Maybe a villain is validated by how much you want him to get what's coming to him. I really wanted Max to get his. It's a little show tune to describe Patric's performance as ""delicious,"" but what the ef. Call it as you see it.

Not that the film spends too much time dwelling on it, but I think Max's destructive weapon of the day may have been something called a sonic dematerializer. His scheme revolves around instigating a hi-tech global war. Max is a tool.

Maybe my strongest quibble is that Holt McCallany's Wade doesn't really demonstrate why he's got this rep as a bad mofo. There's a good bit about Max ordering him to hire an eighteen-man kill squad but then Max changes his mind and orders Wade to kill the kill squad.

- Max: ""What's the matter? You related to them?""
- Wade: ""Actually, one of them, yeah.""
- Max: ""Really. By blood?""
- Wade: ""A brother-in-law. I said I'd kill him.""

That pretty much sums up Wade's big badasss moment. The rest of the time, he just stands around, not living up to his street cred.

This is a cool movie, flashy and frenetic and snappy banter-full. It might even be worth purchasing. Stay for the end credits as Jensen and his Loser mates attend his little niece's soccer game.",1289001600,4,4802,4.788647342995169
4162323,3,B003OCWF6I,"What works:  Fine performances by Idris Elba, Zoe Saldana, Columbus Short, and Chris Evans.  They sell the movie to me, when the other actors can't.  The stylized action is good for the most part, and pieces of the script are rock solid.  The general feel of the movie is fun, without taking itself too seriously or too silly.

What doesn't work: Source material was already bad, and unfortunately the movie doesn't make it that much better.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives a lazy performance as does Max the villain.  Having this unthreatening comedian play the villain, put a major damper on the suspense.  Some of the one-liners are embarassing.  And while the action scenes as a whole are entertaining, the gunfights are less than exciting.

There's loads more good and bad things about this film, but generally it stands mediocre.  It wasn't a great comic, and that may be why it's not a great film.  If you're an espionage fan, this may interest you more, but as a common moviegoer, it doesn't do a whole lot for me.  With a better lead and villain, this film may have became a favorite of mine.

4162328,4,B003OCWF6I,"""The Losers"" is a perfect example of a studio mishandling the marketing of a good movie.  I have a vague recollection of it coming out in the spring prior to the impending heavily promoted summer blockbusters.  I told a good friend of mine about it who is a big action afficienado and he had no recall of it at all.  I didn't go into it with high expectations thinking it would be nothing more than a series of CGI and explosions that passes itself off as action.  To my surprise ""The Losers"" had a gripping story at it's core directed at a breakneck pace to keep your attention throughout.  The characters were full-bodied and not caricatures despite the film's comic book origins.

4162330,5,B003OCWF6I,"Firstly, I went into ""The Losers"" with low expectations.  To be honest, I couldn't remember if it was it or it was The Expendables in my DVD list, so perhaps they were even lower.  Couple that with the fact it was based on a comic (and I'm not comic-hatin', believe me, I am however in general comic-movie-adaptation-hatin') and I was prepared with finger poised on the stop button.

There really is no ""down-time"" in The Losers.  It starts running from minute 1, and pretty much goes full steam until minute 97.  I've always felt that, for the most part, if you can't say what you came to say in 90 minutes, you better have a great reason, and most movies do not.  The Losers doesnt have much to say, so perhaps this explains the brevity, but for pure escapist fun, its hard to beat.

Far smarter than the promos would've led you to believe, this movie revels in its own wit and fast-moving humor as much as it does it's McG-style action editing, which did on occasion get a little old.  We've seen this type all before, and its been done slicker and harder (see: Smokin' Aces).  Still, that stop-motion CGI action has impact, and when combined with truly sharp acting (Jeffery Dean Morgan, in his usual subdued cool as well as Jason Patric playing the nut he probably is in real life), there is rarely a dull moment.

At the end of the day, I watch a lot of movies, but buy relatively few anymore.  Most have solid qualities, but little replay value.  The Losers will go in the ""own"" category, and I hope they see a sequel, because they did the first one right.",1286064000,,1563,4.426573426573427

4162336,4,B003OCWF6I,"The Losers is a story of betrayal and retribution that doesn't take itself too seriously that concerns an elite U.S. Special Forces unit sent into the Bolivian jungle on a mission that goes awry. Were they set up by someone within their own government? The team: Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch and Cougar, must go rogue since they have been betrayed by the mysterious and powerful Max, an operative high up in the heirarchy of the CIA. They are recruited by the beautiful Aisha, who may have her own agenda, but it is one that also involves getting revenge on Max. Working together, they must remain deep undercover while tracking the heavily-guarded Max, a ruthless man bent on embroiling the world in a new high-tech global war.

The Losers is based on the DC Vertigo graphic novel by Andy Diggle with illustrations by Jock. It is an action thriller but there are also a lot of strangely bent and humorous moments, mostly provided by Jensen (Chris Evans), the designated comic relief, but the rest of the cast also get in a zinger or two. The scene where Clay (JMD) and Aisha meet--ostensibly a hook up but actually Aisha knows exactly who Clay is and is recruiting him--is amazing. It is smokin' hot, if you like fighting as foreplay, and Clay and Aisha definitely do.

---------------
Aisha: [whistles at the sight of Clay's Bolivian hotel room] Wow. It's everything a girl can dream of. Do you have a bathroom?
Clay: No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom.
==========

Jeffrey Dean Morgan was in Watchmen, and this scene reminds me of a similar one between Nite Owl II and Silk Spectere II. Hard to say which scene is my favorite, but they are both intense. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was also Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy, but after two great performances in Watchmen and The Losers, he is exonerated and his stint on Grey's is expunged from his record.

---------------------------
Roque: Okay, you stay with us. But if anything smells like a trap, I get to put a bullet in your skull. Does that sound fair?
Aisha: That sounds fun.
Jensen: Sounds like my parents...
=============

Aisha is played to perfection by Zo Saldaa. She was Neytiri in Avatar, Nyota Uhura in 2009's Star Trek, Anamaria in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and Laila in Drumline. But what really impresses me is that she was in 2002's Crossroads with Britney Spears. That film also had a Grey's Anatomy connection in that it was written by Shonda Rhimes, the creator and head writer of Grey's. But Zo has a beautiful body, so we won't hold that against her. Zo Saldaa is beautiful and talented and her star is definitely on the rise.

---------------------------------
Clay: Jensen, are we wired?
Jensen: [disguised as a street vendor] Max is westbound... and these hot dogs are *delicious!*
=============

Chris Evans as Jensen was brilliant. As Johnny Storm in The Fantastic Four he was also a stand out, a perfect mix of cocky self assurance and self deprecating mockery. Great rapport/tension between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, too. It's clobberin' time! As Jensen, Chris Evans was my favorite Loser (Zo Saldaa wasn't an actual Loser, so Evans wins).

---------------------------
Clay: Whatta you have on her?
Jensen: Besides a pant-bustin' crush? Her Company file is blank. CIA has a standing kill order on her, as does Hamas, Sinn Fein... pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick am-scrayed.
=============

Roque, Pooch and Cougar may be Losers, but they are no slouches. And did I mention Jason Patric as the evil Max? Does anyone remember him as Michael in The Lost Boys? He was an excellent villian in The Losers. He was on par with Sam Rockwell in Iron Man II, or Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four.

------------------------
Roque: Come, on, Clay! Look around you. I mean, do you think we're in a position to actually take on some CIA super-spook?
Clay: Roque...
Roque: It's a hell of a plan. You know what? Pooch could set up over there by the taco stand, and Jensen could set up communications right there by the hookers.
============

The Bottom Line is that The Losers was a very entertaining film with great action and special effects sequences, but it also offered character development, both comedic and dramatic. This film came out before the remake of The A-Team and the Sylverster Stallone vehicle, The Expendables. I just saw the trailers for those other two films, but can't imagine that either film was as good as The Losers. Don't know why The Losers didn't do better at the box office. Got the feeling that A Team was a botched effort, but Expendables may have been worth a watch just for the cast of action heros, both young and old. The Losers was a tightly written action movie with some laughs along the way and at least one very sexy scene. It had everything you could ask for in a movie of this genre. Zo Saldaa won my heart, but Chris Evans was my favorite Loser.

---------------------------
Roque: [Seeing Jenson's Pink Petunia shirt] Am I the only one who sees this shirt?
Jensen: Oh, yeah. It's my niece's little league soccer team, the Petunias, they're in the finals, so I...

Jensen: They're... they're in the finals!

Seems like every other movie these days is a comic book remake (are there that few good scripts floating around?). In the comic book vein, The Losers is a pretty good effort. Morgan is fun, if no great actor, the rest are entertaining, and the action is fast and plentiful.

It's light in tone yet very violent, and the violence is so endless that it gets rather tiring after a while. Jason Patric made me laugh as the villain a number of times, and along with Evans adds most of the fun here. Saldana didn't do it for me; she was far more annoying than sexy, a nightmare in many ways. Maybe that's just me. And hey, it's just a comic book, I mean movie, so who cares.

If you need to see a lot of bad guys get shot and a lot of stuff get blown up, The Losers will do it for you.",1282780800,,790,4.019108280254777

With its Mr. & Mrs. Smith overtones, the scene with Zoe Saldana and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the hotel room, justifies the price of admission all by itself. Chris Evans as Jensen and Columbus Short as Pooch, plus the fine newcomer Oscar Jaenada who plays Cougar round out the cast wonderfully as each is a vital element to the story line. The characters vibe so well with each other. A great surprise was the sexy Idris Elba, whom I adore. His character Roque showed he is more than capable of playing a believable bad guy. His acting is so terrific he made me dislike Roque immensely. The interaction between Aisha and Clay set up the necessity for a sequel, and I sure hope it doesn't take forever to come to fruition.

The acting is not engaging. After 30 minutes into the film, I was so bored that I almost walked out. The last fighting scene with the jet looks exactly like one from a James Bond movie. Yet, it does not act like a Bond picture.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production budget was $23,591,432.
However, its domestic gross was only $23,591,432. So, it's truly a loser.

This is one of the worst movies released in 2010.",1282435200,7,593,4.628571428571429
4162351,5,B003OCWF6I,"I love this movie like cake! Okay, yes, there's an extremely high body count, and a few moments that make me really uncomfortable, but those moments are all by the villain, who is so villainous that at least I can be fairly sure we're not supposed to think what he's doing is behavior to be emulated, so there's that.

I've seen some critics complain that the plot is familiar, and it is, but you know what? So are most plots. What matters is execution, and the execution in this film is terrific! The cast is wonderful, everyone has a great sense of comedic timing and is equally great at the subtle or dramatic moments as needed, and there's great chemistry among them. They're also all extremely easy on the eyes -- a definite bonus. The characters are interesting and fun, the dialog is snappy, and there are some surprisingly poignant moments. Zoe Saldana's character is absolutely awesome, especially in that -- unlike in so many movies of this type -- she's not just the love interest, and her motivations are entirely independent. The characters of the Losers themselves fit together like pieces of a terrific puzzle, and the little moments between them and among them really make them believable as a team who's been together through a LOT, which is one of the things I love most.

This is a great action/comedy/drama that is both really satisfying and makes you want more. I've cut way back on my DVD-buying since Netflix, but this is one I had to have! I've watched it many times, and will watch it many more. A+++, would buy again!

If you want to see more of what you'd be getting, you can probably find some clips on YouTube. Be wary of spoilers, though -- especially in the clip about how Jensen forgot his gun. That one contains a HUGE spoiler, so avoid it if possible.

The special features on the Blu-Ray disc are also great. The regular DVD only has one, which is also on the Blu-Ray disc, and is itself a very good feature, but if you like special features and have a Blu-Ray player or have been thinking about getting one, I recommend the Blu-Ray version. And let's face it, more and more releases are going to do this to us, where you can only get the really robust special features on the Blu-Ray. I bought a Playstation 3 so I could watch these and I don't regret it.

Of course, Dragon Age: Origins has eaten my life, because I got that for the PS3 not really thinking I'd play it much.... *eye-dart*",1282348800,5,2425,4.502272727272727
4162352,3,B003OCWF6I,"As an action film, this one is harder to categorize than I expected.  Despite a lot of violence, it has enough camp to keep it from being a hard core action movie like the Expendables, but it's more than a popcorn flick like the Transporter films.  I agree with another reviewer that it's a smart action film, with a familiar storyline but a non-traditional execution.  A band of special ops is betrayed by superiors and want revenge.  The filmmakers use the graphic novel basis to great effect, giving a very stylized presentation.  The film begins with each of the main characters being introduced - the camera pans to and freezes on their face as their name is stamped on the screen; a similar effect occurs when the location changes. In fact, the camera freezes more than a few times during the film to good effect.

The acting is top notch.  Other than Jackie Earl Haley's Rorschach, I thought Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian was the best thing going in ""The Watchmen.""  Here, he's also conflicted but staunchly a ""good guy.""  He was totally believable as the leader of this ragtag band of Losers.  And Chris Evans surprised me - happily, there's more to him than eye candy Johnny Storm characters.  Perhaps the biggest surprise was Zoe Saldana.  It wasn't just seeing her kick a@@, she had to hold her own against an entirely male cast and she did just that.

I would have given the film four stars but for one thing, the villain.  Max is a strange contradiction; he's utterly ruthless with no regard for life, but also somewhat comical with a ""greatest criminal mind of the century"" mentality.  That was fine for Lex Luther in a film with no visceral violence - but not here.  I'm not sure if it was the actor, or the writing, but he just didn't quite work.  Overall, I think fans of graphic novels-turned films (Sin City, 300, etc), and those looking for a different take on action, will enjoy this.

The DVD doesn't offer much in extras.  There's one featurette, ""Zoe and the Losers,"" that discusses Saldana's character and how the actress tackled the role and there's a commentary track.  I would have liked a featurette on the graphic novel and how it was adapted, but considering the film didn't do well in theatres I guess it's better than nothing.

4162354,3,B003OCWF6I,"This movie is tons of fun. It's a comic book twist on an old war horse where a group of special ops guys get betrayed by their handler (in Bolivia no less) and need to find a way back to the states to exact revenge.

This is generally a well written, well acted, well directed action flick with yuks to spare. The yuks don't come from out and out jokes or gags, they come from the losers' characters themselves. Most of them are well written (Chris Evans is a hoot) which really helps this puppy move. The action scenes have a lot of style and there are a few twists in the plot that keep things from getting too stale.

There is a lot of over the top, impossible stuff happening here and the plot does have some holes in it but you don't care. If there is one complaint I have it's that, in third act, the action gets sincere and much less fun, so it loses some of the niftiness that had been building up throughout. But, all in all, it's still a fun watch.

This doesn't arise above it's comic book, B-Grade roots but you'd be hard pressed to have a better time while watching. Grab a beer and some pizza and have at it.",1282262400,,1122,4.137614678899083

Basically a military unit is set up by a mysterious man from the CIA, while everyone thinks they are dead their actually trying to prove themselves innocent while hiding out. When a mysterious women comes along an offers to help the men get their reputation back they have to decide if they can trust her. An whole trying to deal with their known enemies, they also have to deal with those lurking in the shadows.

4162360,1,B003OCWF6I,"This movie was awful.  An A-Team knock off with about equal depth of acting, TV show not the 2010 remake, and the brewing action could be dissolved with  a mild antacid.  It seemed that the director was distracted through the movie by something else; perhaps, the only distracting feature of the entire thing, Zoe Saldana.  There is a hot scene where she and Jeffrey Dean Morgan duke it out in a burning hotel room - I suggest skipping to that scene and when it's finished remove the DVD from the player.  You won't be losing out on much.

Oh, yeah! And there's a bad guy, who I almost forgot about.  He was so fresh out of the bad-guy-action-movie mold that he himself looked loss; searching around the globe for exotic locales that have not been over used by the more orignal, the more menacing.  He failed to be even an entertaining plot device, nay tool.

The original comic was set in WWII, that would have been a better jumping off point.",1280793600,9,944,4.473684210526316
4162361,5,B003OCWF6I,I really enjoyed this movie.  It was full of action and twists.  I also enjoyed a few laughs.  Great actors and the story really kept my attention.,1280534400,,147,4.37037037037037
4162362,5,B003OCWF6I,"The movie starts out with an elite undercover group (The Losers) operating in Bolivia. An air strike is called in to take out some drug dealers. The Losers espy children in the group being used as ""mules."" They attempt to call off the strike, only to be foiled on the radio by a guy named ""Max."" With 5 minutes left, they go in and do a rescue operation, saving the kids from the air strike. A helicopter comes down to pick them up, but can't transport both The Losers and the 25 kids so the The Losers give up their seats (Buddy Holly thanks you.) The Helicopter is shot down and all those kids are killed.

The Losers realize they were the target and they toss their dog tags into the wreckage to make it look like they died. While living ""undercover"" in Bolivia they meet Zoe Saldana who tells them she can get them back home if they go kill Max for her. The movie contains some minor plot twists, but it is not complicated. The characters are convincing and likable. The acting was simply great. The dialogue was original, crisp, and witty. The soundtrack was great, but why does every movie which involves spooks (CIA) and Latin America plays ""Black Betty?""

The movie does push the PG-13 boundries. Lots of explosions, lots of gunfire and some corny dialog is peppered throughout this film to keep your interest up; but this film gets pretty tedious since the plot and the dialog is recycled from the A-Team.

4162365,4,B003OCWF6I,"Jeffrey Dean Morgan is the leader of a Special Forces unit and much like Hannibal in ""the A Team"" (I definitely see why there are comparisons made), he has a heart of gold underneath a very tough exterior. Anyway, while saving a group of children, his unit is betrayed by ""Max"" (a super bad guy). Following the leads where they go.....including to a very sexy and very mysterious Zoe Saldana, Clay sets out to find the truth and soon even he realizes that everything is not as it seems, and that the puppeteer may be closer than he initially thought. I thought that this was a great action/adventure movie. There were good guys/bad guys, a team of kick butt soldiers (Rogue, Pooch, Jensen and Cougar), a little romance, a lot of fight scenes, and twists and turns (with the plot). I also had no idea that this story was based on a comic book so that was a bonus. So, for a weekend flick....if you don't want anything too deep and dark, this is the flick for you. Especially if you enjoy Jeffrey Morgan, who I think is a decent actor but who seems to die in every movie or TV show that I have seen him in (for example, Supernatural, Grey's Anatomy, and Watchmen).

4162370,3,B003OCWF6I,"There are enough 4 star reviews here to label this as better than the typical action film, which it is, but being a fan of the comics, I do have some points of contention.

The Good:

It's really fun to see these characters brought to life from the books; the whole cast is great. I think the movie does a better job with the character of Roque as opposed to his role in the books. Lots of the great panels from the comics are rendered quite faithfully here; actual panel art from the comics is interspersed into the intro and credits as well. I really liked that.

The Bad:

Condensing the 500+ page story into an hour and a half just doesn't work; the movie deserved a longer running time. Movie starts really strong, but the villain/Max character just doesn't work with what is presented here. (SPOILER) Aisha's conflict with Clay is reduced to about 4 sentences of dialog in this movie, whereas you get to actually see what she is ""unhappy"" about in the books and that's significant.

I wasn't that impressed with the picture quality here for a blu-ray release; but at $20, which includes an additional DVD and digital download, I'm not unhappy with the purchase.

The extra with Andy Diggle and Jock, author and artist of the comics, were also a must see, in my opinion, for fans of the comics.",1279843200,,1299,4.506382978723404
4162371,2,B003OCWF6I,"Most of the four & five star reviews rationalize the script and action shortcomings as simply the comic book foundation of this film. Well, I will go a step further and say that most of the action would have had the heroes booted out of 7th grade special ops class immediately e.g. how can a 100 lb female subdue a special ops commando that, besides vastly more experience, is twice her size? Even worse are the swinging round house punches that any beginning middle school boxing class would have laughed at (looks good on film though). That aside, the comic book graphics and freeze frames of people being dispatched was just cheap-looking filler. And, the doomsday device looked-like and acted-like a garbage disposal in the sink except the garbage was an entire island. On the positive side, that doesn't leave an environmental mess. I will give a bit of credit to one or two good explosion/destruction scenes. Acting - who cares, and the ever evolving one-against-many numbers keep escalating as if the latest film can't succeed unless the kill ratio is greater than any prior competitors' action movie.",1279843200,3,1108,4.898936170212766
4162372,3,B003OCWF6I,"The film adaptation of Andy Diggle and Jock's Vertigo comic The Losers is a breezy, fun, flashy, and entertaining action flick, and not much else other than that.  The Losers follows a team of special forces ops (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada, and future Captain America Chris Evans) who are looking to get revenge on the evil mastermind (Jason Patric) who betrayed them and wants them dead.  Even with a mysterious new partner (Zoe Saldana) by their side, things don't look to go too well for anyone involved.  At its core, The Losers is fun enough with solid work from Morgan, Saldana, Evans, and Patric especially, though whether or not you're a fan of the comic or not, you'll still find it to be mindless flashy mainstream action that surprisingly pushes the limits of its PG-13 rating.  Still, there are much worse comic book adaptations that you could waste your time on, so in the end, The Losers isn't too bad and a step above being mediocre.  In that respect alone, it's worth checking out.",1279843200,2,1033,4.748603351955308
4162373,3,B003OCWF6I,"the action in The Losers is great, but in story will have you shaking your head with disgust.

My biggest issue was the theme that the CIA is evil, operates like a crime syndicate, and murders innocent children for no reason. Secondly, the CIA agent who acts as the movie's villain buys ""environmentally friendly"" nuclear bombs (no joke, it's in there) from Indian scientists, to sell to ... China. No mention of Islamic terrorists, or even Islamic nations. In fact the Indian scientist who's involved goes on a rant to make SURE the audience knows that he is Hindu and NOT a Muslim.

This movie has great action scenes, and hits all the right points; lots of explosions, special effects, and good camera-work. However, the Leftist propaganda ruins this film for me. The writers obviously have no problem casting our intelligence agencies as the moral equivalent of Satanic child molesters, but take pains to not offend Muslim audiences (although they're apparently not worried about offending Indian audiences).",1279843200,,1012,5.053892215568863

But for a good action film and a action film with Zoe Saldana who been in lots of geek films like star trek and avatar and she said that from herself that she is a geek. the only person who I hated in the film and lots people hated him is Max well the guy playing Max is Jason Patric is was really bad. Jeffery Dean Morgan was descent as Clay and Chris Evans is funny as hell Idris Elba is getting better with his America voice and this is a DC Comic series by Andy Diggle and this guy named Jock and this guys are British as well as Idris Elbra and the losers is a good action film until the end so check it out.,1279756800,,753,3.896103896103896

Luckily `The Losers' was a far better movie then the buzz about it. Really awesome action and more laughs then some comedies. The big name cast also adds an extra kick.

Although it IS a halfway decent action flick, there were holes in the plot that were so obvious that it was frustrating to watch and I frequently found my attention wandering away from the movie. The movie seemed rushed and too many gimmicks were thrown in, in my opinion. For instance:
The character, Pooch makes a rocket (McGuyver style) and fires it into the air at absolutely nothing and the team is celebrating but this rocket isn't used for anything. it was a pointless plot sequence.
Again, Pooch is flying a helicopter over an operation and somehow, 1 man on the ground recognises him and begins firing at him. There is NO WAY he would have been recognised from the ground. All the man does is looks up in the air and says ""Pooch"". He can't even see into the helicopter.
Another character, Jensen was more annoying and cliche'd than entertaining. Everytime you see him, they changed his tshirt as though they were advertising for a friends business.
There were frequent plot holes like this in the movie but as for a run of the mill action flick that you can watch to waste some time, go ahead.",1279670400,,1202,4.595348837209302

The Losers is based on a comic book and the A Team well you know....  When the A Team video comes out I will review it, but of the two, The Losers was the best.  It is grittier and rougher arond the edges and true to its source the comic book. Edgy is the key word here.  The Losers are a no nonsense group of men and woman.  The whole picture is feels harsh , grimy, rough, and delibrately anti slick .

The characters are stero typical in many ways,BUT since they are not well known actors/faces they come across fresh and dare I say it ""likeable.""  I am very inpressed with Morgan[Clay] the leader. His character has flaws and he is not always right.  The ""girl"" is truly a badass and that is why during one ""funny"" scene the losers try to kill her.  Oh the ""sex"" scene is really HOT, pun intended.

The action is enhanced by the use of different camera angles.  The main thing I want to praise and bring attention to is the use of humor.  Humor in films particularly action movies must never be forced or corny.  It must flow out of the action and usually it is dead pan.  The Losers does this right and it makes the funny lines sound natural and funnier.

If there was death match between the A Team and the Losers, it would be no contest..The Losers, they fight to win and they don't fight fair or try to trick you.

The credits were welcome and a nice touch.  I hope there will be another film, but since this one didn't really make money, I doubt it.  That is ashame because I would love to see this group again.",1279584000,5,1688,4.202492211838006
4162379,5,B003OCWF6I,"If you want to see car chases, go watch ""Driving Miss Daisy"" or something. If you're into genuine cerebral action thrillers, look no further than ""The Losers."" It's like an elaborate chess game. I've watched it three times now, and I keep learning new things. So hey, Breakfast of Chumpion, if you're into degenerate, unibrow trash, why don't you just quit reading this and go watch some junk like ""The Straight Story""?

To help give you an idea of the complex, ""Inception""-like thinking process at play in ""The Losers,"" there's this one particular moment in which one of our loser-heroes shows particular brilliance:

""Why don't we all tie our dog tags together and throw them into the flaming wreckage so the bad guys think we were on that chopper? That wouldn't look suspicious. Now, say something funny and pat me on the butt like we're wearing tights on the football field. Oh, yes!""
""Hey wait, aren't we the bad guys?"" asks another character.
""Yeah, but we're the 'good' bad guys,"" says the first dude.

See what I mean? I still cry during that heart-wrenching moment when Clay sees the teddy bear burning in the wreckage of young lives turned to BBQ, young lives that were only being hustled to some other South American regime that would exploit their tenderness -- so, whatever, really.

I've never seen a film in which the characters are so often running toward things on fire, and that's saying something because I've seen that TV movie directed by what's his name, the fruity redhead from ""Happy Days."" Unlike the let's-draw-straws-for-who-drops-the-soap guys in that movie, these gentlemen genuinely love women, family comes first and they always behave properly when in attendance of their children's sports activities.",1279411200,,1733,4.986159169550173
4162380,3,B003OCWF6I,"On the surface, it's just another action movie. Stuff blows up, people get shot, the bad guy is trying to destroy the world and the good guys are trying to stop him. It's the perfect popcorn movie.

But take a closer look at The Losers and you'll start to see that there's more than just mindless entertainment going on here. It's not trying to deliver a message, thank god, and it's not an action movie with pretentions of being great art. But it's smart, well written and well acted, and that separates it from the last 10 action movies you paid good money to sit in the dark and stare at.

4162381,4,B003OCWF6I,"In 2010 a crack Special Forces unit was betrayed by their government and set up for a mass murder they didn't commit.  These men promptly (?) escaped their explosive assassination attempt to the Bolivian underground.  Today, still wanted by the CIA and an evil villain named Max, they survive in order to seek revenge and reclaim their lives.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, it's too bad; because a mysterious woman has already hooked them up with their ultimate revenge mission, and you CANNOT hire The Losers.

Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  It should; it's very close to the A-Team intro (which is a GOOD thing).  The similarities don't end there, as both are a group of former soldiers led by a charismatic figure with an affinity for unwinnable situations, cool behavior, celebratory smoking.  Each team has a lady's man, with the leader being both in The Losers.  Each team engages in high firepower, explosive situations that involved meticulously planned tactics requiring a peculiar amount of fortune.

The teams differ, however, in their configuration and purpose.  Whereas the A-Team had a lady's man who appeared to be just that, and a leader who appeared to only lead; that is to say, he managed multiple oddball personalities, The Losers shows each person as an integral part of the team, a specialist in his own field.  This was a positive spin on the ""mercenary group battles the world""-motif.  Additionally, the Loser's ""employer"" is given with a bit more purpose and underlying story, as mysterious Aisha funds and organizes their mission while maintaining her own agenda.

This is a hands-off, good time movie.  Explosions, military action, high-tech gadgets, a fairly hot hookup between the film's leads, and fairly awesome special effects make it fun throughout.  Add in a fiery male-female fight scene (ala Mr. and Mrs. Smith), a comically evil villain in Jason Patric (DO NOT drop his umbrella!), a Spanish Justin Long (scar Jaenada), quippy one-liners, and a very short runtime (97 minutes), and the result is an underrated comic book adaptation that entertains yet gets unfairly overlooked.

4162382,3,B003OCWF6I,"All ask for in these type of movies is 4 things. Stuff blows up. Comedic lines are given. The characters are great. The movie is consistently entertaining. The Losers has a hard time living up to these standards. Stuff does blow up, but except for one or two scenes, they don't really have the impact you want. Comedic lines are given. A character is good. And the film lags dearly between all the action. On these aspect, the film mostly fails, but overall, it's entertaining enough. Let's expand on these points, shall we?

Stuff Blows Up: By far the most memorable scene is where a motorcycle does an awesome crash into an airplane, and it blows up, and Jeffrey Dean Morgon walks away from it, because let's face it, cool people don't look at explosions. And while the rest of the action isn't as memorable, it still kept me entertained while watching the film.

Comedic Lines Are Given: If anything, this film will renew your love for Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing."" Most of the jokes comes from Chris Evans character, but the others on the team do their share of one-liners & amusing dialogues as well. If Jason Patric's character is anything, he's unintentionally funny. How evil is he? He shoots a woman for not holding his umbrella right. I found that amusing. But I'm also a dark and disturbing person apparently.

The Characters Are Great: Chris Evans has had a very long streak now of being the best thing in every movie he's ever been in, and this continues in full-force for the Losers. I suppose he actually has a skill, but the movie mostly turns to him for laughs. A sequence in a building featuring Evans caused uproarious laughter in my theater, and other scenes featuring Evans are also great. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a cool dude, but not a specifically memorable character. Same with the rest of them. They all have their traits, but none except for Evans really stick with you.

The Movie is Consistently Entertaining: Here's the problem with movies like these. They have to keep up a great pace so the audience isn't really thinking about what's not happening at this very moment. Why? Because they start asking questions about plot holes, or ""Why are these characters even here?"" The space between action may not be as long as I may make it out to be, but the film could have been more easily paced. I could also discuss plot, but hey, are you really watching this movie for plot?

Overall, The Losers will make for a good matinee or rental, but not much more. I know it's kind of a mindless action film, but there's just not enough substance here. Plus, if you have the choice between this & the new A-Team movie with Liam Neeson, there really isn't a choice. The A-Team blows The Losers out of the park. No, watch The Losers for some decent action sequences and Chris Evans. There's no Win-Win situation here. Everything just ends with the word ""Lose.""",1276905600,,2878,4.62426614481409
4162383,4,B003OCWF6I,"I'm a fan of movies that have lots of explosions and lots of guns.  Having never read the comic, I didn't really have many expectations for this movie, but I really enjoyed it!  In fact, it amused me so much that it made my short list of movies to buy brand new instead of buying used from the marketplace!",1276128000,,306,4.169491525423729
4162384,4,B003OCWF6I,"When a CIA black ops team are framed and left for dead by a mysterious guy named Max (Jason Patric), they come out of hiding and seek revenge. While a mysterious hottie (Zoe Saldana) claims she can help them get Max, but what are her true intentions and who's side is she really on.

The movie occasionally silly with some goofy moments, especially in the end involving a plane and a motorcycle. Despite that though the film is always entertaining. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Watchmen, Supernatural seasons 1-2) probably would have made a better Hannibal than Liam Neeson in the upcoming A-Team movie and he shows why in the Losers by shining in a similar role.

I also liked Chris Evans and I think he was surprisingly better here in a cocky and talkative role than he was in the Fantastic Four movies. He's more entertaining in the Losers than he was in those 2 movies as well. I still don't see him as Captain America though, due to that character being less cocky and goofy than anyone Evans has played. Jason Patric is also in good form as the nutty wisecracking villain.

My only problem with the Losers is that should have ended the story with one movie. It's a good movie, but I don't see sequels happening, especially due to the not so great Box Office performance. But I recommend checking out the Losers since I enjoyed it more than the new Nightmare on Elm Street, hell even a little more than Iron Man 2. Just don't expect anything more than a fun movie that's occasionally pretty funny and sexy.",1275609600,,1503,4.538745387453875
4162385,4,B003OCWF6I,"I have to admit that this movie was entertaining. The movie is based on a comic book, and the story seems to prepare us for the upcoming ""The A-Team"" adaptation. The movie has it's action packed moments and plenty of laugh-out loud moments also. Of all the leads in this movie, it was Chris Evans who stole the show and provided some comic moments in the movie.  In some scenes, you can almost predict when there will be a car blast, when someone will get shot and when the lead star will save the day. ""The Losers"" delivers about what you'd expect and has some tricks up its sleeve which makes it worth checking out.",1274227200,3,617,4.3652173913043475
4162386,5,B003OCWF6I,"I had no knowledge of the comics that this movie was based on, so I really went in with no expectations. For me, having no expectations is a great thing as it leaves me free to just enjoy the movie. Even though the movie opens with comic book graphics, it still manages to feel fresh. The action scenes are edited in a shaky manner that attempts to raise your excitement with freeze frames that reflect the panel style of the original comic book. Also, The Losers thankfully lacked the family friendly feel that Iron Man and so many movies lately ooze.
Overall, it's a fun movie, with an easy to follow sequential plot. Sometimes it's nice to watch a movie you don't have to think about, and you'll get a few chuckles out of it. Plus, the soundtrack is almost another cast member, one that I'm a big fan of. Actually, now that I think about it, the soundtrack uses a bunch of the songs off of the Glee soundtrack.... hmmmm...

I learned the following things from this movie:
Countries and cities of interest are labeled so as to be easily found from the air.
The man in charge can often be identified by a sports or suit jacket. 2nd in command may wear a vest.
A helicopter and a magnet can pick up a heavy armored truck.
When forming an ""offensive perimeter"" people only look up and not 20 feet away.
Geeky guys always wear interesting T-shirts.
People who have just had sex walk in slow, stuttering movements.
Holt McCallany may be an illegitimate Baldwin brother.
Surprisingly, hot chicks lie to hairy guys and double cross them.
First person knife fighting is essential to any good plot.
The best way to stop a plane is with a flaming motorcycle.
You can disarm a bomb by duct taping the detonator.

Memorable lines:
""I gave you the hit him in the face nod, not the throw him off of the building nod.""
""We don't need seat belts, the G Force will hold you in your seat.""
""Clay and his unit? That sounds like a porno, Wade.""

My recommendation:
Go see it in the theater where the sound will be great. Obviously renting is will be an enjoyable experience as well, but I think the bass it the theater would make the explosions just a bit better",1273449600,,2144,4.422784810126582
4162387,4,B003OCWF6I,"Adapted from the short-lived Vertigo comic series, ""The Losers"" delivers a solid B-action-movie experience. It's got humor, `splosions, and an over-the-top bad guy played by Jason Patric. A few things holding this film back from true greatness are the over-stylized editing (it feels a bit gimmicky after a while), the fight scenes are fast and frequent but aren't that memorable, the plot seems like it was lifted from an ""A-Team"" episode, and there's no big name stars to pick up the slack for the less than original characters that fill the film. Jeffery Dean Morgan is the leader of The Losers, and while he did an excellent job as The Comedian in ""The Watchmen,"" I couldn't help but wonder how much more an actor like George Clooney or Russel Crowe would bring to the part.

However, the cast has some major talent with Zoe Saldana (kicking butt and in her underwear no less) and the future Captain America, Chris Evans. I doubted Evans' ability to pull off the part of Marvel Comics' most patriotic superhero, but his performance in ""The Losers"" has convinced me otherwise.

I understand this movie is based on a comic book by Vertigo, but I never read any, so I couldn't compare it. My favorite character was Chris Evans as Jensen, because he had all the hilarious lines.
