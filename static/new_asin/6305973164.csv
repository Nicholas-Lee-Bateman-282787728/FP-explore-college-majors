7898756,4,6305973164,"UNDER OATH is not a very good title for this procedural crime thriller, which features strong performances from its three male leads.  The story centers on a couple of cops, who frustrated over the lack of getting either a promotion or a raise, plan a little sideline activity to get some off the record cash.  When the deal goes wrong and an undercover agent is accidentally killed by one of the cops, their lives undergo serious changes.  Jack Scalia (Dallas) is the cop who masterminds the scheme, and Eddie Velez (The Hunted) is the cop who pulls the trigger, and who has a conscience to boot.  Add James Russo as the tough Captain and you have three sturdy, convincing performances.  Although director Dave Payne doesn't keep the pace as quick as necessary, UNDER OATH nevertheless is effective and does have a surprise twist that I did not see coming.  Gritty and better than average.",1107216000,2,890,4.746753246753247
7898757,2,6305973164,"For starters you have the wrong title listed for this movie! it's called ""under oath"" not ""urban justice""!
This movie is about two cops who have to track down a killer. There are few twists and turns along the way. The DVD is very bare bones!! It has a few trailers of other movies besides this movie! This DVD also has a very bare bone actor bio on it!! Also it's not closed captioned like most DVD's are!!
Jack Scalia does his best in this B grade cop movie!! Rent it first before you buy it!!",991008000,,495,4.166666666666667
