8000256,3,B0000D9PIV,"I agree with the other reviewer in that it is not the 2 dvd's that are pictured, it's just random songs and my DVD looks like it's a bootleg, like someone changed the vhs to media or took a video of the TV . The picture quality stinks. I expected more for 12 bucks !! I love Jeannie Bartels, my children grew up with the tapes and VHS' and I wanted this for my grandson, but the DVD is lacking, I'll probably return it !!",1483142400,,421,3.9647058823529413
8000257,4,B0000D9PIV,I didn't realize when I bought this it was just the music from the 2 shows. my mom owns both movies on vhs and my kids started watching them. since the vcr broke they were excited to have this dvd. my kids want to watch the whole show but they have enjoyed watching the songs and singing along with them. I'm not sad I bought it,1369353600,,328,3.984848484848485
8000258,5,B0000D9PIV,This video is great for young children!  The music is lively and very entertaining.  Joanie is very fun to watch and my daycare children loved it.,1368576000,,146,4.576923076923077
