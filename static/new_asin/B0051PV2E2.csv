Since Britain came out very weakened after World War II and very soon had to give out her empire, I understand why some Indians might feel some indirect sympathy for Nazi Germany. But still, it's not clear to me why this remake was filmed, though it provides some amusing scenes in their ludicrousness (because it has some entertaining value, I did not give it a bottom rating).

None of the terrible actors looks German, which is quite obvious since they are all Indian. Some of the scenes in Downfall, especially those set in the Fuhrer Bunker, are copied almost verbatim in this film. And it is quite funny how a massive battle like the battle of Berlin (which resulted in 200,000 dead, 500,000 wounded, 500,000 prisoners) is acted with just a few extras. Or how outdoor scenes that are set in Europe were clearly filmed in India. Some viewers might be offended as well that the crimes of National Socialism are not mentioned in the movie, and Hitler is portrayed as an honorable patriotic German, a very angry guy but not an evil person (the scene where ""Hitler"" dictates his testament is outrageous in this respect). Also, I don't get why the actress playing Eva Braun speaks in English in this movie while the other characters speak in Hindi, is speaking English a sign of superficiality/snobbishness in India?",1316908800,,1507,4.792307692307692
8453045,4,B0051PV2E2,"The film is supposed to be about Gandhi writing his letters to Hitler, which he wrote two one in 1939 and the other in 1940. The first one to Hitler had a perceptive comment that ""It is quite clear that you are today the one person in the world who can prevent a war which may reduce humanity to the savage state."" Clearly although far away from the action, Gandhi was still able to follow the events in Europe. There is however little about these letters as such in this film. Much of the film is taken up with a comparison of the two leaders Gandhi and Hitler which I am sure is the real purpose of the film. Some with a few Indian soldiers who joined the German army in the closing stages of WW2 trying to escape to Switzerland and much with the last few days of Hitler's life. It is a shame as I would have preferred more on the actual letters.

One point that does let the movie down is the casting. Indian actors just do not work for German characters. Hitler and his people were white. I am sorry but throughout the whole film, it just looks wrong. If it troubles you to try and get over it as the acting is good. I did like several actor's performances very much, in particular, Raghuvir Yadav and Neha Dhupia.",1316044800,,1218,4.227467811158799
8453046,1,B0051PV2E2,"From the promos themselves the movie looks B-Grade. More of a University nukkad-natak kind of sensibility. There is a dialogue which Gandhi ji is delivering in the movie, it goes something like this: ""Ahinsaa ko HATHIYAAR bana kar DUSHMANON se LARNAA chahiye"".............how can anyone who preaches non-violence use words like HATHIYAAR, DUSHMAN and LARNA. A loser of a movie.",1315785600,,377,5.406779661016949
