8329241,5,B001O43EG8,"In this adaptation of the Karoline Lawrence books the four kids live through exciting adventures during Roman times. The stories are relatable for children yet they teach a lot about life of regular people in 1st century  Rome. The locations look fairly real. The TV version is definitely ""cleaned up"" to suit a wide audience and shields todays children from the realities faced by people in Ancient Rome. I wish this series would be picked up by American TV stations.",1388188800,,468,4.85

I have only watched the first 4 episodes (scrolls) and while it is significantly different than the books, I am enjoying the series.",1242691200,5,308,4.581818181818182
