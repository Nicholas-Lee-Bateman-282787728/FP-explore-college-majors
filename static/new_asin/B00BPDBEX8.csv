8572158,4,B00BPDBEX8,"The opening scene has our threesome breaking into an electronic warehouse only to discover it is going to be a Chuck-e-Cheese. The crime is interrupted by a cell phone call by the daughter (Brenna Demerson) of one of the burglars.  Afterwards the film spends time to build character and establish future plot points.

This is a quirky indie comedy which was written, directed, and stars Jonny Cruz. He is teamed with with Jordan Spradley and David Conard. The film centers around a bank robbery and the robbery of Caesar's Phallus, a diamond/ruby object that gives ""new meaning to diamonds are a girl's best friend."" The humor is at times adult, but masked for a PG-13 audience. For instance, there is the BuKaKi Pawn shop and a police detective (Robby Storey) who questionably misspeaks due to an injury.

A fun comedy with a cast that has diversity. Good characters. Nice one Jonny.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Brief comedic near sex scene. Male rear nudity.",1373673600,,961,4.877300613496932
