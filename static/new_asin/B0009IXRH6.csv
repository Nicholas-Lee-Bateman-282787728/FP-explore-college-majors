8061444,3,B0009IXRH6,the documentary was satisfactory just not very well done.  there was the battle from both the whites and Indians point of view but no archaeological evidence of anything.  just opinion.  i thought this would be with archaeological evidence along with battle descriptions form those participants in the battle.  it was not.,1454284800,,322,5.254901960784314

8061446,4,B0009IXRH6,"Four stars because I also agree with the reviewer: Reno's drinking. I have been readying many Custer books and Drink is not mentioned in every relating of the the battle. I don't find Reno's drinking mentioned in some biographies of Reno. Reno's confusing action at the scene seem to be explained by most authors as ""lack of fight"". I wonder if the authors of such books have done their research and don't even mention the possibility of drinking. I enjoyed seeing this DVD. Every bit of information or counter information is interesting to me and gives to thoughtright or wrong.

The case against Reno was reversed in later years. Worth watching this DVD if you are interested in Custer. Too bad the battle scene did not get scientific scrutiny. There are questions that will never be proven or disproven.",1424563200,,806,4.798561151079137
8061447,1,B0009IXRH6,"Since this was produced in 2005 I had high expectations.  It is sad that it does not use any information from the 1984 excavations that advanced a lot of new theories on the battle.
  The program also needs more maps and diagrams of the troop movements.  It is very hard to visualize any of it.
  It does not go into the impact the death of his wife and daughter had on him and his drinking.
  It does not mention that Reno's charge towards the Indian village may have been halted because of a deep ditch that the cavalry horses could not jump.  Instead we are left with the impression that he just got ""cold feet"" and decided to dismount his men because he was incompetent.
  This production needs to cut out all of the scenes with actors and put in more ""meat"".",1377388800,,763,4.302816901408451
8061448,3,B0009IXRH6,"I first saw this at the Gary Owen museum in 2009.  I surprised me then, and it continues to surprise me now that it would be taken seriously at all.  I am always pleased when something new comes along, and heartily wish for more visual interpretations, as it is mostly in the library amid dusty tomes that the LBH debate simmers.  But this was a bit much.

To those new to the fray, all good sports have a scoring method.  The LBH(Little Big Horn) scrap pretty much tries to place you in either the pro-Custer or the pro-Benteen camp of believers.  I exclude Major Reno, much like he excluded himself, for reasons I will delve into.  Suffice it to say, this historical event is dominated by personalities.  Try as you might to keep it to hard military facts you keep coming around to the people and their motives.  The west is full of odd and interesting characters, and the LBH incident packs em' solid.

At the fore is the Commanding Officer, George Armstrong Custer.  A lot has been written about this man.  In fact, it boggles the imagination how much he still manages to stir up such passion for an event long passed, and eclipsed by the kind of insanity only an advanced civilization such as ours in the 20th century could produce.  What is that afternoon on June 25th, 1876, compared to, say, Stalingrad, or Iwo Jima?  How about the Tet Offensive?  Yet it, and the leader of the failed battle, remain fighting words nearly 140 years later.  As we just lost one of my favorite authors on the subject, Evan S. Connell, I will quote him from Son Of The Morning Star:

""More significant men of his time can be discussed without passion because they are inextricably woven into a tapestry of the past, but this hotspur refuses to die. He stands forever on that dusty Montana slope.""  How true.

Custer cut quite a figure during the Civil War.  Many say his rise was premature, yet he was not the only `Boy General.""  His record is good, tainted only by his tendency to charge in where more patient tactics would have succeeded with less loss of life.  It was a tough job, going toe to toe with the Confederate Calvary, and it took a hard charger to stand up to the likes of Stuart.  The Civil War was a huge enterprise, and Custer had an important place in it.  He was part of a pivotal event in American History, part of huge armies maneuvering, plentiful logistics, and lots of fame and attention.  It is no wonder it was such a letdown when it was all over.

Indian fighting had little glamour, fame, or hope of advancement, and plenty of opportunities to screw up.  His one big victory, the Washita Battle, is suspect as Black Kettle and his people were where they were supposed to be.  The attack was because it was reported they were harboring perpetrators of attacks on settlers, and they may have been.  But surprising a sleeping village on its own reservation isn't much in the way of tactical genius.  Even his inspired retreat, after finally being made aware that there were quite a few more hostile just a few miles up the river, may have been suggested by somebody else.  No matter, it was experience, and that mattered, as few else had any at all.  Some call it a dress rehearsal for the LBH, but that too is stretching it a bit.  He was an experienced leader, knew tactics, how to move and maneuver troops, and how to fight.  He had all the requirements for his position, and most of that had to be learned on the job.

His decisions to attack the huge village on the LBH has been and will continue to be discussed by armchair warriors as long as we have a written language.  As time goes on, it remains just as popular.  When I visited the LBH site, I was informed that it is the most visited battle site in America, even more so than Gettysburg.  Scholars and amateur enthusiasts ponder the movements, analyze the battle, and write reams about it.  Custer is at the heart of it all, of course, and he gets treated as all at the heart of a pivotal event.  He is either defended as the God Of War, betrayed by lesser, jealous men, or as a Glory Seeking Adventurer, risking all just to win fame one more time.  That clich about the truth being in the middle somewhere is probably applicable here.  He was an experienced Calvary leader that ran into some very unusual events, and he was defeated because the Sioux won.  His decisions can be debated, validated, or questioned, but one thing is certain: a lot of Sioux ran him to ground, and nearly got the rest of his command as well. Whether or not he made sound tactical decisions makes little difference as he really did meet his match.  It was a good gamble, and made on sound facts, up until the point where those facts were wrong.  He had incredible luck, surprising a sleeping village.  Then it woke up.

Many have to place the blame on somebody, and the public back then was as insistent as ours that a scapegoat be found.  Fortunately, there were others available, and almost made-to-order.  Lets look at them, as they are the focus of the documentary.

Marcus Reno was a staff officer, certainly.  He did see action during the War, but little actual Indian experience.  He was not there for the Washita fight, for example.  He could lead and deploy his troops, certainly, and fared well during his Civil War scraps.  This would be something different, however.
He was ordered to engage the village, to `charge' it.  Now, for those that think it means he was meant to enter the village guns blazing and sabers swinging, think again.  They had no sabers, and the single shot rifle used by his troopers could not be used effectively on a moving horse.  The other weapon, the 6 shot Colt, probably had only 5 shots, as it was rudimentary safety to leave the hammer on one empty chamber to avoid accidental discharge.  So, 5 shots and that was that.  If they got into the village, what then? Most likely, form a little group and wait to be overrun.  So Reno had them stop and form a skirmish line, not a bad choice.  It engaged the Sioux, and definitely took the attention from Custer's movements.  Rifle bullets zipping through your teepee have a way of doing that.  But the skirmish line begins to shrink, as more and more officers and troopers wander into a nearby timber where the horses are being held.  Soon, all are in the timber, and Reno leads a mad retreat to the bluffs nearby- so quickly that most of his command have no idea he has gone.  It causes heavy casualties, that retreat, and they collapse demoralized on a hilltop.  This is Reno's claim to fame, that retreat.  The accusation will be that he lost his nerve and fled, that he in fact led a route.

The other major character, Capt. Frederick Benteen, was off on a scout to the left.  In LBH literature, this action alone commands volumes!  Benteen claims there was little reason for the scout.  Larry Skelnar claims it was in fact part of an abortive attack on a smaller village that the participants said was only a teepee or two that contained a slain warrior.  Opinions vary.  What we do know is that Benteen joins Reno on that hilltop and forever dooms himself to Custer groupies for not abandoning Reno and sallying forth to find Custer.  Is that the basis for the claim of Betrayal?  Not really.  See, if you want to paint Reno at this point as either drunk, raving, or just plain having a little breakdown, you have to realize the burden this would put on Benteen.  It is reported by a participant- somebody actually there, not an armchair general someplace- that Reno begged Benteen for help.  There is an incredible spin put on this time at the later Reno Court Of Inquiry, but the truth is, Benteen found chaos.  He found Reno totally unnerved, his troopers nearly scattered all over the place, from the hilltop down into the timber. The vulnerable pack train is coming up slowly, with all the reserve ammunition.  Benteen has to make a decision, for Reno has placed a great burden on him.  Does he follow the spirit of the last, disjointed message from Custer, abandon Reno, and sally forth?  Or does he wait, collect the pack train, and go forth as a cohesive unit?  Can he trust Reno for simple command functions at this time, or is he trading their lives for Custer, who, as Benteen said at the Inquiry, ""Ought to be able to look after himself.""  He was having severe doubts about Reno, and stuck around.  We know, of course, that when they did eventually get sorted out it was far too late. It may have been too late even before Benteen joined Reno.

So what is the betrayal?  That Reno and Benteen heard gunfire coming from Last Stand Hill and refused to go to Custer's assistance.  Many said they heard no gunfire at all.  Most said they did.  And, I am going by the written, primary sources, not conjecture.  To prove this, the team making the documentary station a couple of listeners on the Reno-Benteen hill and have somebody plink away on Last Stand Hill.  It is so faint, you have to crank up the volume, but there is the sound of a gunshot.  So this proves, as per the documentary, that Reno and Benteen knowingly abandoned Custer to his fate, right?

Firstly, I would have been happier with the test if there had also been wounded horses, troopers, and all the noise a large body of men would make getting sorted out.  This is like finding shells on the battlefield, and using it to support movement theories.  I can find at least 4  instances of visitors picking up shells, fired and otherwise, as well as bits of trooper on the battlefield.  Also, when they marked the places of the fallen troopers, a bit of paper with a name, if known, was placed inside an expended cartridge and hammered into a wooden stake.  That accounts for, what, 200 shells?  Souvenir hunting began almost at once, so you take this as you find it.

Well, if you look at the record, Benteen does not deny there are gunshots.  It is a battlefield, after al!  What he debates is volley fire.  Single shots mean nothing, as the Indians could be shooting up in the air, for all they know.  But only troopers would volley fire.  Some on the hill heard it, to be sure.  Perhaps all heard it, but did not consider the ramifications.  When Benteen and perhaps Reno say they heard no fire, they most certainly meant volley fire that would indicate some sort of defensive posture by Custer.  Benteen himself thought that Custer had been driven off, and left them to their fate.  What Reno thought at this time is obscured by the later need to protect him from his many detractors.

I enjoy seeing visual reenactments of the battle.  One visual I took to heart was of the actor playing Reno.  He is, much as the real Reno probably was, staring off in total disbelief, his head covered by a bandana.  He looks defeated, numb.  It is a good visual.  I also enjoyed how Reno and Benteen casually condemn not only Custer, but fellow officers and friends, not to mention all the enlisted men.  At least they do not twiddle wee mustaches and give each other sinister, knowing grins. Myself, I think there was no such moment.  I think they were busy trying to get a grip on things, not plotting Custer's downfall.  I really do believe Benteen when he later wrote to Theodore Goldin, a trooper in Reno's wing, that he would have went to Custer if he knew- he would have tried.  And, I think he would.  His actions will be debated, as will his life in general.  His feud with Custer notwithstanding, Benteen was a good officer and he knew where his duty lay.  But on that day, all decisions seemed to go bad, it was his misfortune to survive and have defend his name for the rest of his life.

So, what is the final score?  Custer dead, Reno mentally defeated, Benteen in the middle.  LBH researchers want so desperately to reveal what can never be revealed that it sometimes gets a bit crazy.  Nothing is more contagious than enthusiasm, particulary the fanatisicm of somebody with a theory to prove.  It is hard to disbelieve somebody so sincere!  Yet, a large part of LBH scholarship is just that- fandom gone mad.  The pro Custer side attempts to exonerate their hero, and sometimes the man-crush is hard to swallow.  To defend him properly, you need to show that Reno was incompetant and cowardly, and Benteen so full of hate that he would gleefully allow Custer and the rest to die.  To defend Benteen, you need to show that Custer made unsound desicions based on a need for fame and glory, or just because he always did it that way.  You need to deride the Custer Groupies for thier ""Silly hero worship of Custer"", as historian Fred Dustin said.  I wish I could give this more stars.  I gave it 3 because I wand to see more visual interpretations, even if they are as bizarre as this one.  Sometimes, it's the price you have to pay.",1362268800,5,12760,4.49390774586597

Its interjection of several perspectives allows for some interesting classroom discussion after the video.  I think that the other two reviewers' comments on Amazon would be fun to throw into the mix after you have started the class discussion.  =)

8061450,1,B0009IXRH6,"This work is very short on fairness and long on sensationalism. Few historians doubt that Reno was inebriated (as the previous reviewer accruately states, is never mentioned in the film), and he lost his confidence when splattered with the brains of Bloody Knife. But Reno was not alone - Benteen (while not a friend of Custer's) had a long and honorable record of bravery. He would not have left Custer and his men to die if he could help. This film tries (unsuccessfully) to hide the poor tactical decisions of Custer. The most obvious being spliting his command in three before knowing the strength of the enemy. By the time he does know, it's too late. I'm surprised that such a dubious theory was put forth by the National Geographic Society.",1333152000,6,747,4.709923664122138
8061451,3,B0009IXRH6,"After reading ""The Last Stand"" by Nathaniel Philbrick, I watched this A&E documentary ""The New Explorers - Betrayal at Little Big Horn.""  This film focuses on the question of whether Major Reno and Captain Benteen knew that General Custer and his men were engaged in battle at Little Big Horn and chose not to help.  The film examines the actions and inaction of Reno and Benteen as well as accounts of soldiers who admitted to seeing Custer on the bluffs and knew of the engagement.  Captain Thomas Weir, for example, urged Reno to go to Custer's aid.  Unfortunately, he died before he could tell his story to Libby Custer.  The personal feelings of Benteen and Reno towards Custer are also explored.  Finally, historians debate over the likelihood Reno and Benteen's troops could have even helped Custer if they tried.

One issue that is not covered in this documentary yet is stated several times in Philbrick's book to the point of sounding like an apologist's take, is Reno's alcoholism.  Philbrick stresses the point that Reno was drinking at the time and that whiskey clouded his judgment and leadership.  This documentary makes no mention of Reno drinking on the job.

The highlight of this film is a test to discover if Reno's men heard Custer and his troops going into battle.  Bill Kurtis and researchers stand on Reno Hill and guns are fired two miles away at Medicine Tail Coulee.  The researchers are excited when they hear the gun shots.  They can barely be heard in the film and are not picked up by the tape recording equipment set up at the site.  I question the practicality of this evidence.  These men were just standing there in silence listening for gun shots.  During the battle, hundreds of men were there probably rustling around.  Would it have been as easy to hear gun shots two miles away?  Also, does atmospheric conditions or climate affect sound waves?  The researchers react as if this test was undisputed proof that Reno knew Custer was going into battle, but I am not convinced. ""Betrayal at Little Big Horn"" is a very well-done documentary, but its omission of Reno's lack of sobriety and its failure to fully examine the usefulness of the gun shot test lowers the score.",1321574400,12,2207,4.760526315789473
