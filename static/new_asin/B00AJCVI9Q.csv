5439991,5,B00AJCVI9Q,"What can be said about Elvis movies!
He is an icon of our past. Fun to watch with a bag of popcorn at the drive-in the 60's.
Nice to watch now and reminisce.
And see the changes of our Hawaiian Islands to.
Aloha Enjoy.",1410048000,,218,3.977272727272727
5439992,5,B00AJCVI9Q,"A while back, I decided that I must own every single Elvis movie and this collection has a couple of his stand outs along with a couple worth owning but watching perhaps once.
Come on!  It's Elvis",1393372800,8,196,4.297297297297297
5439993,4,B00AJCVI9Q,"These Elvis Presley movies vary much in style, quality, and period of his film career, although 2 of them have a Hawaiian setting in common. I give it 4 stars largely on the strength of ""King Creole"" (1958), which is probably Elvis's best movie, and he considered it to be his best film too. If you haven't seen it, ""King Creole"" (KC) is a gritty musical drama set in New Orleans, with a thuggish Walter Matthau trying to force Elvis to sing in his club or else. Carolyn Jones is also fine as someone unwillingly caught up in this underworld life, and the scenes between her and Elvis sparkle. The songs (""King Creole,"" ""Crawfish,"" ""New Orleans,"" ""As Long As I Have You,"" etc.) are very good and fit well with the theme of the movie. In the New York Times' review for ""King Creole"" they stated ""Elvis Presley can act,"" which was a bold statement to make about Elvis in the 1950s when the established media usually attacked him.

""Blue Hawaii"" (1961) is the next best movie in this collection. The strongest elements in it are Elvis himself, the pretty songs (""Blue Hawaii,"" ""Can't Help Falling in Love,"" ""No More,"" Ku-u-i-po,"" ""Hawaiian Wedding Song,"" ""Aloha Oe,"" etc.), and the gorgeous Hawaiian scenery. Although the script is variable and quite predictable, overall ""Blue Hawaii"" (BH) is an agreeable comedy dealing with Elvis returning home to Hawaii after his time in the Army. Both the film and the soundtrack have been major hits among Elvis fans.

Then we've got 2 movies from the mid-60s when Elvis's movie career was slipping in both quality and popularity, although he still made a few decent ones in that era. ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" (1967) and ""Paradise, Hawaiian Style"" (1966) are not embarrassing but they're hard to get excited about. ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" (ECEG) has Elvis as a scuba diver searching for sunken treasure. It's got a so-so script, and while it's basically an agreeable comedy it does not have great songs going for it that KC and BH do. ""Paradise, Hawaiian Style"" (PHS) is somewhat a rehash of BH with Elvis as a pilot for a helicopter service who is chasing several attractive Hawaiian gals. Other than the South Pacific tune ""Drums of the Islands,"" PHS also does not have the high quality songs that BH and KC boast, but it has much pretty scenery and Elvis's scenes with the child actress Donna Butterworth are charming. Incidentally, I enjoy reading about Elvis's movies in the fine book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-Presley-in-the-Movies-with-DVD/dp/1435118553/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis Presley in the Movies with DVD</a>&nbsp;by Timothy Knight.

With regard to technical aspects of this set, KC is in black-and-white, while the rest of the movies are in color. All movies are widescreen versions, and on all films the box adds ""enhanced for 16:9 TVs."" However, the only movie here that is very widescreen is BH at maybe 2.35:1, while the other 3 are probably 1.66:1. Picture quality is decent on all 4 films, but I was a little disappointed with the appearance of BH and PHS. BH looks quite good, but I believe if it had been restored properly it would not have any scratches and would be sharper on my high-definition TV. However, the colors on it are very good and on most TVs it would look fine. I doubt that PHS has been restored since it's pretty grainy. All 4 movies have audio options of English mono or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound in English, although I don't have a surround sound system so I can't assess that. ECEG and PHS also have the audio option of French mono. All films have optional English subtitles, but not in other languages. KC and BH include trailers, but that's it for extras. The movies are on 4 discs, which are all attached to one hub in the case, and that makes them more vulnerable to getting scratched.

So, overall this ELVIS 4-MOVIE COLLECTION VOLUME 2 varies a lot in quality, but is a GREAT price just for its 2 strongest films, ""King Creole"" and ""Blue Hawaii."" If you love all 4 movies, well partner, this set is a STEAL!!",1371168000,21,4056,4.823275862068965

5440021,5,B00AJCVI9Q,"Four of Elvis' best for less than $2.50 each.  You can't go wrong.  Blue Hawaii is probably Elvis' most completely entertaining movie and is not on Blu-Ray yet (only his concert films and Viva Las Vegas, with a limited edition Follow That Dream released by Twilight Time are out on blu-ray as of this writing) so DVD is it if you want Elvis.

If you're an Elvis fan this is the way to go.  4 Movies 4 Discs and anamorphic at that.

Blue Hawaii, Easy Come - Easy Go, King Creole (a little seen classic in itself), & Paradise, Hawaiian Style are included and each one is true to Elvis.

Like I said for the price you can't beat it!!!",1426636800,5,631,4.216666666666667

8552523,3,B00AJCVI9Q,"I love these movies.  Unfortunately two of the 4 have audio problems - specifically, ""Paradise Hawaiian Style"" and ""Easy Come, Easy Go"".  The audio keeps fading in and out especially on the musical numbers.  It's not so bad that you can't enjoy the songs, but it makes them inconsistent, like the mike was wobbling back and forth during the recording of the numbers.  For the price, it's an annoyance and not worth sending back, but people should be aware of this issue prior to purchase.  I, for one, will listen to Elvis no matter how wobbly he sounds.",1483401600,,554,4.612244897959184
