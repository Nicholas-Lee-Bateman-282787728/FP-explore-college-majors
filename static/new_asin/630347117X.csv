654094,5,630347117X,"I first saw this movie when it was first released to theaters. This movie was way ahead of its time, a movie about Native Americans that showed them in a good light. The movie was filled with action, love, compasion, and much more. I loved it in 1975 and still love it today. This movie is good for nearly all age groups, has minor bad language, some killing (of course) but without blood being shown etc. You find yourself tearful at the end, a mix of tears of joy and sadness.",998956800,35,478,4.263736263736264
654095,5,630347117X,If you found the atmosphere of The Song of Hiawatha charming you will like Winterhawk. The director did a good job of leaving the viewer with a sense of something irrevocably lost. Very rough around the edges compared to the slick films of today but still worth owning.,998697600,16,269,4.625
654096,4,630347117X,"This movie is typical of the 1970's and late 60's view of the bad white man vs. good native American. Similar themes run in the movies Little Big Man and Billy Jack. This video has been edited for television. Key scenes from the original screen version have been deleted which really disappointed me. Maybe they will make a DVD of this classic film some day and sell it as the ""unedited version"". Otherwise the ending doesn't make much sense. The scenery is beautiful and I liked the original so much that I gave it 4 stars. Dawn Wells played a good role and seemed at home under the buffalo robes.",982972800,5,598,4.445454545454545

654189,4,630347117X,"Great character actors, solid story, and beautiful cinematography make this a film worth watching. The story is honest and sympathetic towards the Blackfeet nation, struggling to survive smallpox brought in by the white man.

654191,5,630347117X,I first saw this movie when it came out on HBO or similar channel. I was so impressed I named my horse Winterhawk. The movie was sensitively done. For once our Native Americans were not cast as savage and brutish. They were humanized. The scenery is impressive and the horse back riding outstanding. I was happy to find Winterhawk on Amazon.,1461369600,2,341,4.60655737704918
654192,4,630347117X,"I loved the spectacle of this beautiful movie.  Saw it in the theatre when it first came out.  It literally changed my life.  Having grown up in the desert southwest an in a large city,  this movie inspired me to choose a life in the mountains.  I do hope they release an HD version on Blu-ray.  My VHS player is now retiring and this is not an easy movie to find.  But I love to replay it for the cinematography, good acting by Leif, great mountain man portrayals and costuming, and a beautiful Appaloosa horse that never stops dancing. Negatives are the corny linguistics of the not really Blackfoot braves and the use of reservation period crafts, beadwork and costuming to adorn the pre-reservation Blackfoot people.",1457222400,,720,4.666666666666667

654282,5,630347117X,"This is an outstanding film starring Michael Dante in the title role as Winterhawk, the leader of his People of the Blackfoot Nation. The script did not call for Winterhawk to be a spiritual man, but award winning actor Michael Dante portrayed him as such a man, strong and sensitive. Dawn Wells plays the captive and love interest and the end of the film is the best part. Does she go off with Winterhawk in the end or not? You have to see the film to find out. :) It's awesome! I purchased this film from Exceptionalbooks and the service was prompt and Victoria, the owner was very easy to contact and deal with. I would recommend any of your DVD or VHS purchases to be made from from Exceptionalbooks. They care and it shows.",1446940800,,728,4.4
654283,4,630347117X,"This was an enjoyable film. It is an older film but for once it does not depict the American Native as a savage idiot which happened a lot
during the time this film was made.  That alone makes it worth watching. I would have liked it better if they had used Native Americans to play the roles of the Indians but I guess that would be asking too much at that time. As another reviewer mentioned, it is the story of a warrior who tries to
obtain medicine from the white community for his people who are being devastated by smallpox. As you would expect, that does not happen. It does leave you with realization that the Native Americans were seldom dealt with fairly. Definitely a movie ahead of its time.",1445126400,2,703,4.366412213740458

654353,5,630347117X,It seemed like a good representation of how a small percentage on both sides of conflicts between Native Americans and those of European descent could be heartless and vicious savages.

It tells the story of a Chief, Winterhawk going to a white settlement looking for help in the form of a cure for the smallpox virus that is killing his people. He brings furs with him to trade for this cure, but some very bad white men cheat him out of his furs and try to kill him. He then kidnaps a white woman and her little brother as revenge. He treats them with..., well I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I purchased this movie in VHS form and loved it. I watch it over and over and will continue to do so until my tape wears out. I keep praying I will see it in DVD form and will purchase it as soon as I do. Maybe if enough of those of us who are fans of this movie try to find it in DVD form, they might get the hint and update to movie to DVD.

The photography is breathtaking and you get a sense of the freedom of the old west and the native Americans. The plot itself is very simple, but still enjoyable.

654588,5,630347117X,This movie is breathtaking with its photography and the story is sympathetic to Native Americans.  The original movie had a wonderful soundtrack but apparently they didn't use it in the VHS version.  I wish there was a DVD version with the original version of the music.  Charles Pierce died a few years ago and I know he won some type of tribal award for his films.

I was sadly surprised to discover that the original music score for ""Winterhawk"" (on VHS) has been replaced by a piano dub that reminds one of the silent movies of old.

The story, natural cinematography, special effects and authenticity of the period, are still intact, but I can't give the release five stars as I would otherwise. The racing piano is just too annoying to ignore. I still have a VHS copy somewhere, taped from a television showing, that is the original theater release.

This movie is not a typical western movie, it is about trappers, christian missionaries and the Chief Winterhawk, who tried to save his people from illness brought to them by the white man. The movie shows the good, bad and ugly of life during the 1800's. It is also a romance and love story between Winterhawk and white christian missionary girl. Charles B.

For some reason there were only 1000 copies made with the original score.  That is a real shame because the original was breathtaking.  However, the movie is an excellent one.  The story, both interesting and sad grows on you as the movie progresses.  Although it is a ""powderpuff"" western in the sense that one can tell much of the brutality is softened a bit, it is still worth watching over and over.

654596,4,630347117X,"This movie may be low budget, and the dialog mediocre, but the actors, such as Leif Ericons, L Q Jones, Denver Pyle and Dawn Wells, do a good job of carrying it off.  I own the VHS, but I say this move long ago and seem to remember some scenes that were not on the tape.
The story line is really not all that predictable.  Winterhawk, a Blackfoot chief, needs medicine for smallpox which is destroying his tribe.  His first encounter with the white traders is catastrophic, and he retaliates - for the era, it seems quite logical - he takes hostages to trade for the medicine.
The ensuing chase presents some unforgettable scenery, and delves into the beliefs and philosophies of various groups.  This is not the typical ""bad Indians"" movie so many people were accustomed to in the 70's.  In that sense, it was ahead of its time.  A lot of people still won't like this movie for that reason.
I gave this movie 4 stars because I think that in its way, it was a cutting edge effort, and as a history buff, it does a creditable job of showing the relationship between Indians and white hunters/settler/missionaries that existed at the time - not all of the bad guys were red.",1192924800,27,1172,4.453271028037383
7847808,4,630347117X,"RELEASED IN 1975 and written/directed by Charles Pierce, ""Winterhawk"" chronicles events in western Montana in the 1840s when small pox breaks out in a remote tribe of Blackfoot. The titular chief (Michael Dante) goes to the New Americans to apprehend a remedy, but things don't go well and a movie-length chase ensues. Dawn Wells from Gilligans Island plays the female lead while Leif Erickson plays a mountain man whos friends with the Blackfoot. Woody Strode, Denver Pyle, L.Q. Jones & Elisha Cook Jr. have peripheral roles.

While watching, I was reminded of 1977s Grayeagle and therefore wasn't surprised to discover that Pierce made both films. Grayeagle is superior, though, and it shows that Pierce learned a thing or two while making this one two years earlier.

The movie has its points of interest, like a notable cast, with great alpine locations and moments of aesthetic wonder. But its marred by a sometimes draggy vibe with overly syrupy moments and a blaring piano-oriented score that starts to grate due to its booming redundancy. Moreover, Winterhawk (the character) is depicted as excessively mysterious, noble and superhuman, not to mention more time needed spent on his group in the chase for the simple sake of human interest. If you can handle these cavils, however, this is a worthwhile Western.

Some have pointed out that Winterhawk is noteworthy because of its respectful view of Native Americans (who aren't really native since their ancestors emigrated from Asia), yet pro-Indian Westerns actually go back to Buffalo Bill (1944), Fort Apache (1948), Broken Arrow (1950) and The Last Wagon (1956), not to mention the more contemporaneous A Man Called Horse (1970) and I Will Fight No More Forever (1975).

THE FILM RUNS 98 minutes and was shot in Kalispell & Browning, Montana, and Durango & Silverton, Colorado.
