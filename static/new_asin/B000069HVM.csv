7965553,4,B000069HVM,"Death Rides a Horse is one of the best Italian westerns. Beyond the Law has a messy plot, but it's fun. The sound could be better, and subtitles would have been wonderful.",1492992000,,171,4.375
7965554,5,B000069HVM,I loved Death Rides A Horse.  Beyond the law was just so so may be 1 1/2 star.,1477180800,,78,3.3333333333333335
7965555,4,B000069HVM,Lee Van Cleef was a B-Western legend. These were 2 of his best westerns.,1469923200,,72,4.214285714285714
7965556,5,B000069HVM,"This is a great pair of Spaghetti Westerns. The picture quality  of ""Beyond The Law"" is pretty poor in the beginning but soon improves. The sound quality is really poor,but if you can ignore that and watch the movie for the story,action and characters;you'll find it excellent. Hey,if you want to watch a good western,forget the westerns of the last few decades,they can't even compare with one like this.
 In this classic Wild West showdown (actually photographed in Spain or Italy),Lee Van Cleef is appointed sheriff of Silver Canyon after he chases away a gang of bandits attempting to steal the town's stockpile of silver. Even while carrying a badge,Van Cleef has no intentions of protecting the gold,since he is also intending to steal it. When all is said and done,it  leaves no doubt that he is a man beyond the law.
 "" Death Rides a Horse"" is a tale of revenge over an innocent boy who witnesses the horrible murder of his family by evil outlaws. He vows  to avenge their deaths and years later hunts down the killers. Along the way he meets  a stranger ,Ryan,( Lee Van Cleef),who is also after the same outlaws,but for his own greedy reasons..They join forces in their pursuits.
 Lots of action and the quality is good.
Another Western classic.",1447372800,,1254,4.724770642201835
7965557,1,B000069HVM,Incredibly poor quality with both movies.  They look like an extremely bad VHS copy!,1429228800,,84,5.0
7965558,5,B000069HVM,"Death rides a horse is one of my top 5 westerns. Obviously the quality is not on par with today's standards, it was a low budget spaghetti western. Don't let bad reviews deter you from purchasing. Understand that these old westerns are gritty. There's no special effects, no beiber, no kardashians, just a very entertaining movie about revenge. If you like spaghetti westerns, this is one of the best.",1424908800,3,401,4.826086956521739
7965559,5,B000069HVM,"LOVE LOVE lee van cleef. thats the reason i bought this and i will probably buy some more. quality is adequate. as long as i can see that hunk, i am happy",1420675200,,154,3.84375
7965560,2,B000069HVM,"I bought this only because I had an absolutely horrendous copy of ""Beyond The Law"", and I took a chance that this one would be better.  It is.  For example, in the beginning of the movie one of the actors sets a book down - on my old copy I couldn't read the book's title, on this dvd I can.

With that said, understand that the picture quality of these movies is still pretty bad.  The colors are washed out, faces are stretched, detail is poor, etc.

Encore Westerns, which I get in standard definition, has been broadcasting several Lee Van Cleef movies lately (""Beyond The Law"" is not one of them, but ""Death Rides A Horse"" is), and the picture quality, while certainly still lacking, is 100% better than any dvd I've seen.  And I know that ""Death Rides A Horse"" is sometimes broadcast on Retro HD, but since I don't subscribe to that channel I cannot comment on picture quality.

The above is my long-winded way of saying that you're better off burning a TV broadcast to DVD than purchasing this or any other less-than-popular western collection DVD.

Lee Van Cleef in ""The Grand Duel"" was recently released on blu-ray, and the one review (as of today's date) here on Amazon is positive.  I've obtained it, but haven't watched it yet.  Maybe the best thing to do is to wait for good blu ray's if you want these westerns.  I've read that some of these blu rays are still crappy quality, though, so buyer beware.",1340928000,,1415,4.466926070038911
7965561,2,B000069HVM,"My title sums it up-- some parts are decent, even good, but others are horrible--  fuzzy and occasionally pixelated.",1242864000,4,116,5.105263157894737
