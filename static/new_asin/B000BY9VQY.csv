8474947,5,B000BY9VQY,"I've seen a preview of this disk set. It's not your run-of-the-mill docu.

First, there is a 60-minute ""docudrama"" in which a network newscrew and in-studio anchor witness the invasion of Earth by Martians. The acting is (mostly) quite good, lots of mystery and old-fashioned tension. No special effects to speak of. It's a bit of theater, with one FX shot to pay off at the end. Fun.

Then there is ""Ms. Intergalactic..."" Hard to know how to summarize this. About 20 minutes, a funny (sometimes very much so) comic piece about an intergalactic beauty pageant. Unfortunately, the contestants are clips from old monster movies, so no booty-call for the men in the audience. But's it's a fun thing to watch.

Then there are the obligatory 90 minutes of Mars science film (courtesy of NASA), and finally a mini-doc about the Jeff Wayne muscial version, with some interviews with sci-fi fans before and after (these people, obviously at an SF convention, are almost as scary as the musical version of the WOTW!).

Altogether a lot of fun, but if you are expecting a traditional doc it's probably wiser to go with the others listed here by Goldhil, etc.",1132617600,12,1148,4.782828282828283
