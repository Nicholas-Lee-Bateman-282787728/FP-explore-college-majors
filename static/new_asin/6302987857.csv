532229,5,6302987857,"I genuinely do believe that this has to be one of the most misrepresented and misunderstood films of all time. It is extremely tongue-in-cheek, a surreal exploration of a sad, pathetic, horny and longing individual who lives in the dream-like world of sexual obsession. The acting and direction are rather unorthodox in order to contribute to this theme. Beautiful scenery, erotic imagery and an unusual plot make this an utter classic.",996710400,8,436,5.154929577464789

It's not a movie that can be watched with half of your brain. [....] You have to PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE.
There are undeniably breathtaking scenes in this film. How could someone watch it and not be chilled, thrilled and completely turned on? I'll never hear a song by Enigma again and not think of Julian Sands being watched from the closet....OUTSTANDING!
I've recommended this movie to friends time and time again. Since the day I first saw it, it's occupied a place in my top 10 and I'm sure it always will. Watch and learn about humanity, insanity, sexuality and obsession.",996624000,16,833,4.673469387755102

532232,4,6302987857,"When I ask people if they've ever seen this movie, they all say no. I think this movie has been ""slept on"" so-to-speak. I've seen it a few times (mostly because I tend to see things the second and third time around that I missed the first time.) Granted, that the idea of the movie is a little twisted. It's basically a story about a man's love and/or obsession for a beautiful woman. The object of his desire shows nothing but her loathing towards this simple man and wants nothing to do with him. The only thing he really wants, is for her to love him back (mind you - this is MY interpretation of the movie.) I guess the trip part about this film is how he manipulates the situation and makes it so that she NEEDS him to survive - to feed her, to bathe her, to tend to her. Perhaps I just have a twisted sense of humor, but I thought this film was GREAT! It's old, but if you ever get a chance, pick it up at your local video store.

532233,1,6302987857,"I had high expectations when I grabbed this film at Blockbuster to view. After about half an hour I realized I had made a terrible mistake. Not only does it transcend all bounds of decency and good taste, it simply is the worst film ever produced. The acting is horrendous. No one seems to know what to do or how to utter their lines. The direction is non-existent. Well, I'm sure she tried to direct it, but the result is amateurish and borish and, most of all, unbelieveable in the truest sense. There have been no films I've ever wanted to destroy after viewing. This one is surely the first. Make all the gags you'd like about the worst film ever made (sci-fi monsters with zipper-showing costumes included), but this piece of nonsense surely is the worst piece of excrement ever created. What a waste of film and processing chemicals. Just being the offspring of a film director ain't a-gonna make you a filmmaker.

532234,4,6302987857,"Often a film of such a bold and original nature gets blasted by critics, and indeed that is what happened to Boxing Helena. When considering that these same critics overly praised such Hollywood Summer tripe as Star Wars Phantom Menace and Men In Black, their panning of this and other films fall flat! Boxing Helena is a daring, imaginative exploration of one man's dangerous obsession. The direction is tight and artistic, the acting top-notch and the script a highly definative character analysis. I'd gladly give more stars, but MGM did a terrible injustice to this film by offering a bare-bones DVD.

This is his personal hell. His parents ignored and despised him just like Helena does throughout this very interesting movie. Intelligence,money,fame,prestige,charisma,good looks can't give him what he really needs - some real  love. Somehow I look like Julian Sand's character,I mean,every woman I meet( I fall in love with),simply ignores me. This is what happens to Sand's character.

532323,4,6302987857,"Boxing Helena

""Do you love me as a woman? Or as a possession?""

 As women we are forced to wonder why exactly we are loved, carrying bodies that evoke the masculine desire that presents itself physically and sometimes violently. In a world where a woman can't walk down the street without being 'cat called,' the 1993 film fits perfectly. The first film of Jennifer Lynch goes within this so called soul of a man obsessed with the undying beauty of a woman he once obtained; possessed for less than a single evening. The thriller follows Nick Cavanaugh (Julian Sands), doctor plaqued by his deeply ingrained ""mommy"" issues which fuel his obsession with Helena (Sherilyn Fenn).For Nick wholeness meant nothing, he didn't love her as a woman and therefore a person, but rather he lusted for her as an object.
 Helena is strong, independent and knowledgeable about her own needs. If she wants a man she takes him, a goddess most powerful, strength in beauty and seduction, gifts held by many fine woman and often unappreciated by the feminist community. To be beautiful is a gift, one which historically has proved useful, given life to generations of beautiful people. To use ones beauty for personal happiness, too is a good thing, an understanding of resources.
 Both Fenn and Sands show extreme skill throughout the film in depicting extreme characters in controversial situations. Fenn is confident and uses her body with total grace while Sands portrays the awkward and uncomfortable man with seeming ease.
 Today we talk a lot about choice, about consent and the unreality of 'asking for it.' Helena asked for none of the abuse taken upon her body, none of the pain suffered. Should she have caved to the wants of a man larger and more financially powerful than herself, cave to love when she felt none for herself? No. One could look at Helena's dismissal of Nick as rude, stuck up or bitchy, but I see it instead as a mark of feminine strength. Of the men in her life he is the one with money, the one who could show her great things, but rather than use him she chooses to push him away. Throughout the film the camera focuses on a replica of the Venus De Milo which sits in the house where the bulk of what Lynch calls a ""silly fairy tale."" Helena is from beginning to end is a modern version of the goddess Aphrodite.

A woman is something soft; something warm when you feel her. When she's naked. When she's touched. Discovered. You see that things happen inside of her. She opens up. Sometimes a woman is sad. Sometimes she's angry. Helpless. Beautiful. Sometimes she's strong. She's still only that one woman.

 A woman is a great many things and it is up to only her to control who and what she will be. Technically Nick possesses Helena the way he possesses a vase, places her on a pedestal and admires what is left of her beauty. However, he must realize that he can never have her without allowing her freedom to be her own person. If he loves her as a woman she can never truly be his.",1410220800,2,3003,4.587686567164179

It is kinda funny though I noticed that the cover has Julian Sands name wrong (they forgot the s at the end of Sands) and the description has a bit of typo as well. Heck, we all make mistakes. Other than that I didn't laugh... It's a great movie, one that I watched in my mid-teens. Which has me thinking, what the heck was I watching at that age! But yes I thought it was great then and I think it's a great film now. That's why I decided to add it to my collection. Julian Sands character is so creepy if he wasn't so hot I would've purged. Sherilyn Fenn is an incredibly beautiful woman. Her character here was a real selfish bitch it made me feel sorry for her. This movie is so creepy, uncomfortable, sexy, and very provocative!

532343,5,6302987857,"Ever Since I saw this movie back in College, I have seriously LOVED this movie!  The cast is excellent (Bill Paxton, Art Garfunkle, Julian Sands, & Sharylin Fenn), The plot convoluted & twisted (Is it live or a dream), & yet something that I think most of us understand (Which is the someone we REALLY wish would love us back).
  Let's face it, this movie is really an S&M thing that goes extreamely awry!!!  While I think many people (Myself included) would go a LOOOOOOOOOONG way to show someone how much we cared for them, this movie shows an extreame of what someone would do to show how much they love someone (And it's pretty extreame!!!).
  Julian Sands plays this role eloquently & Sherylinn Finn plays an excellent Bitch who just refuses to see how much Sand's character loves her.

532369,1,6302987857,"Kim Basinger paid $8 million not to appear in this film. If that ever keps her awake at night, let me reassure her; it was worth every cent. I have never walked out of a movie in my life, but this is the one that brought me the closest. Spoilers follow, for those who care.

This is a weird idea, about jealousy and sexual obsession taken to an extreme, but there have been weirder - the Night Porter springs to mind - and perhaps done by Jennifer's father David Lynch it could have been made to work. Unfortunately it's badly written and can't find its pitch. It tries to stake out the kind of 'beneath the veil of suburbia lie twisted people with twisted thoughts' that David Lynch has done so well in Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, but without the conviction, and falls very flat as a result. It undermines itself by trying to leaven the horror with the kind of comic moments that Lynch pere handles very deftly. Here they're simply heavy-handed and jarring.

Julian Sands, playing a brilliant but painfully repressed surgeon, lusts after Sherilyn Fenn (okay, I'm with him so far...!), but unfortunately she's a total bitch and spoilt brat, and furthermore can only care about an idiotic jock (Bill Paxton, not his finest hour), while Sands himself is a stuttering wimp who loses all sympathy from the audience very quickly. It's an almost comically stereotypical situation that seems to have been taken from an old Charles Atlas advert, compounded by the fact that all of these characters are just SO unlikeable, to the point where we never care about any of them. However, after getting sand metaphorically kicked in his face for half an hour, Sands is abruptly faced with a chance accident; Fenn is knocked down outside Sands' house in a hit and run. He takes her inside, and operates to save her life, but in a fevered brainstorm decides he will never let her leave here, so he... amputates her legs. This is where the weirdness begins. Unable to give her up, he keeps her in the house, and when she gets too mouthy and domineering (and boy, does she), he cuts her arms off as well, turning her into a living dress-up doll, and eventually keeping her in a box (hence the title). There is undoubtedly a point about objectification of women trying to get out, but it's lost in some poor domestic comedy (although I'm not 100% sure it's supposed to be funny). Her dim boyfriend eventually finds out where she is, but when he sees her, he decides he doesn't want her (believe me, in spite of all she's been through, I was thoroughly with him at that point). But the film isn't quite sure where to go next, and settles for the part that made me cry out in pain in the cinema and nearly walk out; IT WAS ALL A DREAM. Sands took her to hospital and operated on her there, although to what effect we are not shown. So after two hours of unpleasantness the film doesn't even have the courage of its convictions and resorts to the ultimate and corniest cop-out possible. Was this tacked on by a nervous studio? Who knows. All I know is it renders the entire thing pointless as well as irritating and depressing.

532373,4,6302987857,"This film has been on my shelf for years and I just recently decided to watch it. The shining moments are the dramatic elements and the eroticism. It relies heavily on artistic visuals which is sometimes used to mask any bad acting or melodramatic plot line. The one true standout however is the boldness of the director/screenwriter. She attempts to go where few if any have gone: exploring the fetish doctors have for their amputees, in fact revealing a deeper meaning to the limb-less beauty and the insecure doctor. Overall, it was surprisingly good and commanded my attention from beginning to end. It managed to create a high society, artsy film ready for any severing or amputations that may be necessary.

532376,4,6302987857,"By reading the other reviews, you'll gather this film is not for everyone.  I owned this on VHS tape and decided to buy the DVD -- primarily because I think it will be unobtainable in the future.  The underlying theme (as I see it) is the unsuccessful attempt of one man to capture and possess beauty -- in the form of a female form.  Men perceive beauty in various manifestations -- a colorful sunset, a field of fresh flowers, reflections on a body of water, etc.  Included in this catalog is the beauty of women.  Non-rationalizing men will misinterpret this attraction to beauty as a sexual magnet.  The protagonist of the film is not of this ilk.  He is mild, sensitive, caring, attentive, but at the same time totally unconscious of his impossible desires to isolate beauty as if it were a statue.  He does everything he can to discard the troublesome aspects to his imagination -- wherein one will read of all the horrific undertakings (as posted by many others).  But, these horrors are merely symbolic.  The thrust of the protagonist's motivations revolve around his unconscious desires to obtain and hold mastery over the essence of beauty (however truncated).  He has no inkling that beauty is elusive, intangible, something that stirs the soul but cannot be subject to possession.  (Spoiler)  The entire events are revealed to be nothing but a dream, taking the movie out of the realm of mere horror and firmly placing it into a psychological mind-exercise.  The film is bound to be misinterpreted/misrepresented because most viewers will not grasp the element of the male psyche as interpreting all obstacles to his longings as mere physical impediments (albeit in perhaps an overly graphic, realistic manner).  The film triple-underscores this terrible shortcoming in the male unconscious -- something that must be brought to his full awareness for the sake of any/all viable male-female relationships.  Because of the inherent complexity of the subtext, the movie will probably only be appreciated by symbolists and intellectuals.",1295136000,5,2045,5.059701492537314

It's reputation as a lousy film is almost legendary.  Of course when you consider Michael Bay's filmography, you might want to re-evaluate this movie, or maybe not.
Julian Sands(an actor I love) is a rich surgeon obsessed with a woman he had a one nighter with.  The woman, Helena, is played by Sherilyn Fenn, so it's easy to understand his obsession.  However, Helena is a crass, mean, all around unpleasant woman who's on the search solely for boytoys.  Julian's attempts to lure her in result in her being hit by a car.  He now has the perfect opportunity to posses her as he brings her back to his home and begins a process of dismembering her.  Julian quits his job and cuts off communication with his friends, even dumping his girlfriend so he can take care of Helena.  She throws endless insults at him, screams at him, belittles him, and it makes you wonder just what it is that he's so in love with.  Psychological games are played out between the two, and soon some sex is thrown into the mix(Sands brings home one of his tasty looking nurses and makes Helena watch him have sex with her to everybody's favorite Enigma song, Sadness Part 1).  Meanwhile, Helena's sortaboyfriend, Bill Paxton, is trying to find out what happened to her.  Now, this plot may sound kinda grim and gruesome, but it really isn't quite as demented as you'd think.  I don't know why, but the movie sort of reminds me of one of those softcore Skinemax type movies even though there isn't much sex in it.  Sands gives a decent performance, but his character is such a pathetic, whiny, lovestruck schmuck that you just wish you could reach into the tv and smack him one.  As usual, Fenn will make your eyes bug out like something from a Looney Tunes cartoon.  Yummy!!  Apparently Madonna was originally supposed to have this role, and then the role went to Kim Basinger after Madonna dropped out.  Personally I'm glad neither of them got it coz Fenn's my baby.
So no, I can't honestly recommend this movie to people coz the numbers say you might not care much for this one.  I'm just here to tell you that I like it.  So there.",1206489600,32,2286,4.436450839328537

Witness the popularity of fascinating train wrecks like Crimes of Passion, Hudson Hawk and Last Action Hero, each infinitely more entertaining in their own way than a truckload of Oscar-winners. There are few pleasures to rival the completely sedentary evening spent with your most sardonic friends cackling like freshmen on hallucinogens at movies like Boxing Helena.

Boxing Helena turned out to be one of the most hilarious 104 minutes of 1993. The initial buzz that surrounded the film -- insistently referring to it as ""bound to be controversial""-- all but assassinated any potential audience this uproarious trash may have had to begin with. It was said that people who actually saw it tried to get their money back from embarrassed, albeit non-budging, theater managers. But for lovers of Bad Movies, owning the film is a whole other story. When you pop this into the DVD player at home with friends, you welcome the ridiculous plot and anticipate the ludicrous transformation Sherilynn Fenn will go through. Furthermore, Helena takes itself so seriously that we can only respond with gales of derisive crowing.

Fenn plays a convincing man-eating b-tch who makes the mistake of sleeping (just once) with Julian Sands, a prominent surgeon, and obviously some sort of thumbsucking psycho whose mother used to parade around the house naked. Obsessed with Fenn, although she'd rather be bulldozed by a speeding truck than speak with him, Sands climbs a tree to spy on her in her bedroom, makes covert phone calls, and eventually throws a party for her. She comes, dances in the fountain (no kidding, our favorite scene) and, natch, leaves with another guy. This gets our flipped-out doc all steamed up and, apparently, sends him over the edge.

Soon enough, kismet strikes. Party-girl Fenn gets bulldozed by a speeding truck right outside Sands's estate, and the next thing we know she wakes up without legs in his mansion. Not in the best of moods, she berates him, screams her head off and throws anything she can get her hands on across the room. Can't have that, Sands concludes, and soon she's armless too, which is revealed to us when he's spoonfeeding her. ""I have just one question..."" she begins with a straight face. Just try to stem the reflex to ask -- for her -- ""Where the hell are my arms?""

As improbable as it may seem, she grows to love him (sure, We'd fall in love with someone who cut off our arms and legs, too). That does not, however, stop her incessant talking, and we can only presume that Sands would have gotten around to cutting her head off as well, if the movie hadn't ended first. Fenn and Sands are both hopelessly earnest, while the supporting cast either has a superb handle on this nonsense (witness Bill Paxton's shag-haired rock stud) or seems to have wandered in off the street: Art Garfunkel, as Sands's pal, sits around in a silent daze as if someone told him Paul Simon was supposed to show up.

This is the movie that Kim Basinger had to fight like heck to get out of, not to mention cough up a hefty fine -- the best few mil she ever spent. As for writer/director Jennifer Lynch, (weirdo daughter of David), the 23-year-old director, who posed for press shots in front of the Venus de Milo and talked about how we're all in our own boxes, you've got to give it to her -- at least she makes us laugh --  if not with her.",1185667200,5,3413,4.689482470784641
532461,2,6302987857,"Boxing Helena for me is the perfect example of potential-wasting, gutless filmmaking.  Warning, spoilers follow.  Philippe Caland and Jennifer Lynch presented a genuinely interesting and bold plot, that of a masochistic, mother-obsessed doctor (Nick) who desperately latches onto Helena, a beautiful temptress who wants nothing to do with him.  Nick, after having inherited his mother's palatial estate and running into Helena in a bar, decides to throw an impromptu house warming party as cover for inviting Helena into his home where she yet again rebuffs his advances.  Nick then lures her back to his house where she is accidentally hit by a car and has her legs horrible crushed.  Being a brilliant surgeon, Nick manages to save her life though he amputates both of her legs, and it's at this point that the film becomes both remarkable and lackluster at the same time.

Jennifer Lynch, daughter of filmmaker David Lynch, seems as if she's taking a page out of her father's surreal dream-logic filmmaking book as Nick keeps Helena prisoner and begins to slowly and literally deconstruct Helena limb by limb until she's truly an object of his desire.  Helena, on the other hand, spends her time digging into Nick's psyche, taunting his manhood and in a very demented twist, falling in love with him, I believe based purely on his desire for her, which transcends physical beauty (something she is used to men fawning over.)  Unfortunately this second act is severely hampered by pointless complexity (in terms of the number of characters in the film) and some very forced and unconvincing performances (namely by Bill Paxton who's trying his best to invoke his character Sevren from Near Dark and Sherilyn Fenn whose stoicism is almost laughable.)

Though the acting is generally bad and the directing generic, the plot would save this otherwise mundane film, but this to is thrashed by a very trite and gutless third act that ends with an ambiguous twist ending, which implies that the entire second act was either a hallucination or a dream.  2 stars for the plot, but only two because it was handled terribly.",1178150400,3,2116,4.985795454545454

532463,4,6302987857,"""Boxing Helena"" is directed by the daughter of David Lynch, Jennifer Chambers Lynch. This is the only reason I wanted to see this movie. I always get curious when the offspring of a filmmaker decides to follow in their parents footsteps, but when it's the offspring of one of my favorite directors...That only makes it more interesting. And ""Boxing Helena"" is an interesting movie, very much in the vein of a David Lynch film. This film deals with dreams, sexual obsession, and a whole jubilee of weirdness. Watching the film, it amazed me that a woman wrote it. This film feels like it's written by a man, which I'll explain in a moment. The movie is about a doctor named Nick Cavanaugh (Julian Sands), who clearly has a few screws loose. He's got a beautiful girlfriend and, after the death of his mother, a mansion. But there's one thing he doesn't have and that is Helena (Sherilyn Fenn, 'Of Mice & Men'). Nick harbors a full-on obsession for Helena, a woman he had a one-night stand with and can't stop thinking about. He even climbs the tree outside her window to spy into her room. Warned by a fellow doctor/friend (Art Garfunkel) not to mess with her, Nick invites her to a party only to have his ego crushed when she leaves with another man. Fate steps in, however, when she leaves her purse at the party and Nick creates circumstances that cause her to come to his house and get it. While leaving his house, Helena is hit by a car and Nick is forced to perform emergency surgery to save her. He amputates her legs. Now Helena, legless and helpless, is trapped in Nick's house (think of it as ""Misery"" in reverse). Besides not letting her go and amputating her body parts, Nick doesn't harm her. The man loves Helena and doesn't want to hurt her, but simply wants her to have feelings for him too. What it is he sees in Helena isn't really made obvious. Besides beauty, there's not much going for her. She's rude, narcissistic, and cold. Anyway, the remainder of the film consists of Nick trying to keep Helena for himself while her boyfriend Ray (Bill Paxton, doing some of the worst acting he's ever done) looks for her. The ending is contrived and too reminiscent of earlier and later David Lynch films. The films weakness is both the ending and Paxton and the director's decision to use soft-core porn music for her score. There are also a few scenes that look like outtakes from ""Wild Orchid."" Meanwhile, you have Bill Paxton acting like he had never done so. His facial expressions and the way he recites his dialogue in this film is bad. I don't know if you can call it overacting, but it's definitely bad acting. Other than that, the acting is solid. Sands is a good casting choice, because he really portrays how pathetic and lonely this character is. Fenn is good too, making the character easy to hate without making us hate her too much. My only other complaint is the DVD. No subtitles and the audio track is less than spectacular. There's a lot of whispering in the movie (a lot of yelling, though, too) and subtitles would've been nice. Since this is the only film Lynch has directed, it's hard to say what she could accomplish if she made more movies. But this film shows her as a promising young talent, whose biggest mistake was drawing a little too much inspiration from daddy.

Julian Sands' acting left a lot to be desired, although it may just have been the script.

If it is, then I have received ample punishment in watching this.

Boxing Helena is a movie that desperately wants to be a dark, edgy,arty comment on obsessive love.  Not just that, it makes weak use of the themes of how beauty is defined, the power struggle between the sexes and how women are regarded in relation to sex.

This is what we know of Nick Cavanaugh - he is a spineless, whiny, slightly hypochondriacal(the roots of which are never really explained)yet wealthy and successful surgeon with Mommy issues. Aside from a few flashbacks, there's really no explanation why this has translated into such an overpowering lust and obsession with Helena in particular.

We know even less about Helena, and it becomes a slight to a story that appears to want to make a statement on how beautiful and strong willed women (read: bitchy and evil)are punished for behaving exactly as a man would. Her character is not even considered worthy enough to be more than totally one dimensional.

So we have Nick, sexually obsessed and hopelessly infatuated with a woman who will have nothing to do with him; a woman he can only truly love and control by making her powerless-a real life Venus. And Helena, beautiful and cruel, a woman who doesn't really love until she has some of what made her a woman taken from her.

I cringe at the thought that some of the people watching this thought they were finding a ""message"" somewhere in this mess.

Had this movie been well written it probably would have been insightful and disturbing. But it fails on so many levels that it ends up just being boring. With the ending being what it was, it seems like the director and writer realized this too.",1128816000,17,1810,4.616822429906542
532468,2,6302987857,"""Boxing Helena"" is a mediocre effort from Jennifer Chambers Lynch, a close relative to David Lynch (""Blue Velvet"", ""Wild at Heart""). It stars Julian Sands as the prestigious, though cowardly, Dr. Nick Cavanaugh. His mother just passed away, and he returns to his mansion. Meanwhile, he sees Helena (Sherilyn Fenn), a woman he used to date. Blinded by lust, he continues to pursue her. One night, he spies on her whilst taking a jog on the street. But after seeing her make love to Ray (Bill Paxton), his reaction is primarily disgust. He soon devises an elaborate party at which Helena and his friends are invited. Helena spurns Nick, and catches the eye of Russell, one of Nick's friends. Helena leaves the party with Russell, much to Nick's chagrin. On the next day, Helena is leaving for Mexico. However, it's discovered she left her purse at Nick's house. The inevitable happens. She's lured back into his house. He tries to seduce her, but she rejects him. Then a tragic accident ensues, leaving her bedridden. To go into further detail into the plot would possibly mean spoiling a relatively surprising ending. The movie exists mostly for its graphic sexual content. It was initially given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA, and deservedly so. It was perhaps the most controversial film of 1993. It was released just a year after ""Basic Instinct"", which director Paul Verhoeven had to recut several times before getting an acceptable R rating. Graphic content aside, the film became notorious for Kim Basinger's arguement that the film's sex was explicit without being artful. As a movie, ""Boxing Helena"" often fails to deliver. It's plot is unrealisitic, and its dialogue is especially laughable. Sherilyn Fenn's Helena is portrayed as a super-bitchy temptress, while Julian Sand's Nick Cavanaugh is seen as an immoral coward. While backed by a magnificent supporting cast, including Bill Paxton as the loutish Ray, Art Garfunkel as Cavanaugh's sympathetic friend Lawrence, and aided by a soundtrack featuring such songs as Tears for Fears' ""Woman in Chains"", ""Boxing Helena"" fails on almost all critical levels.",1117670400,4,2113,5.074712643678161
532469,2,6302987857,"Ok so Its clear that after watching this movie we all know that David Lynchs talent has not rubbed off onto daughter Jennifer Chambers Lynch, this movie is, not surprising her one and only movie to date.

We are introduced to Nick, a wealthy and successful surgeon who is obsessively in love with Helena, a beautiful woman who he once had a one night stand with. When she has a terrible accident outside his house he operates immediatly, amputating her legs and later her arms.

The storyline Is I think somewhat disturbing, and may have had potential, but It just wasn't pulled off. The dialouge is very questionable, It was particularly funny when Nick says to Helena ""You're sick"" um...shes not the one cutting off peoples limbs! The flick looks and sounds like any cheap b grade film you'd find made in the eighties or early nineties. Also the basis of Nicks obsession is never explained, aside from the obvious, Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) is stunning, we are never given any reason, Nick already has a decent and nice girlfriend, and Helena treats him worse then a dog, the logic just isn't there!

Performance wise, Sherilyn Fenn is great, well as good as one could be with the material given. Julian Sands, I thought he was terrible, couldn't take his accent seriously, might have had something to do with his dialouge ""but Helena I LOVE you!"" every god damned five minutes.

Interesting at best, worth watching for the mystical and beautiful Sherilyn Fenn. If anything an unforgetable film experience, even if it for worse.",1117411200,3,1527,4.79467680608365
532470,4,6302987857,"To fully savor this movie you need to suspend your judgement about the implausibility of the plotline, the stilted and artificial dialogue and  the logistics of the central characters' lives. Once that is accomplished, you can enjoy the riveting sensuality of this production. That is, if you will yourself to overlook the deeply disturbing idea of a man resorting to deliberately mutilating a woman just so that he can keep her company.

The movie protrays the total and all-consuming sexual obsession that drives an urbane, wealthy, good looking and successful surgeon (Julian Sands) into being a grovelling submissive who repeatedly tolerates being humiliated by a beautiful woman (Sherilynn Fenn). The surgeon is the proverbial man who has everything, including the socially appropriate nice girlfriend. But he is driven to insanity by the woman who is initially out of his reach.

At the heart of the narrative is a purportedly deep psychological compulsion. This is the re-creation with a romantic partner of an unhealthy relationship with a rejecting parent. The movie shows short vignettes of the surgeon as a lonely little boy being ignored by his beautiful and seductive mother whose attention he desperately craves.

Whatever its other shortcomings, the movie is refreshingly different from others of this genre in its portrayal of sexual expression. The acting, soft-focus camera work and sensually swelling background music mingle to create an almost other-worldly dimension of eroticism. This is a marked change from the crude, mechanistic and predictable depiction of impersonal sexuality of most R-rated movies.

At least if it was bad I could stare at Julian Sands, hear his wonderful accent and be content. No....this has got to be the worst movie made. Some of the scenes were downright laughable. When Sherilyn Fenn gets her legs run over by the car....the way the scene played out made me and my roomates burst into laughter.

Couldn't control my giggles at Bill Paxton with a mullet overacting in every scene. Julian Sands character was such a wimp. In his case, hamming his performance up might have been better in this movie. Didn't care for him at all, even with his sexy accent. Sherilyn Fenn, I was wishing Julian Sands character would take our her lungs.

The ending....it could have been ten times better without that silly dream sequence.

And don't get me started on the sex scene.  Julian Sands kissing Helena Bonham Carter at the end of A Room With A View was ten times sexier than the scene in Boxing Helena.

If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. I wondered why after seeing A Room With A View, how come I haven't seen him in anything else. After watching garbage like Boxing Helena I understand.

I wonder why) to see what all the fuss was about. I remember the film when it was in theaters a decade ago. I also recalled the whole controversy over Kim Basinger's departure from the project.
Seeing the DVD on the shelf in my favorite video store, I decided to give it a chance. Well, I have to say I don't see what the big hoopla was all about. The film played like a pumped up B movie potboiler melodrama and/or parody of one. Because Jennifer Chambers Lynch couldn't decide on the ""tone"" of the film, we are left to guess what her intentions were. I agree with other reviewers that the camerawork is extremely pretentious in a bad way and the script leaves much to be desired.
Dr. Nick Cavanagh (Julian Sands) is obsessed with the very chilly and cruel Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) after having a one night stand with her awhile back. She loathes him and wants nothing to do with him. His equally chilly and cruel mom has just passed away and left him the palatial family estate. He moves in and things go downhill for him from there.
I think if this film had been released under more subtle circumstances such as the work of a first-time filmmaker and been thought of as an experimental indie instead of commercial studio fare by the daughter of David Lynch, it would have been received more positively. The controversy may have generated audience interest in the film initially but it certainly didn't sustain it. I would argue it actually hurt the film's reception in general.
I like the idea of exploring the nature of a man's sexual obsession and his enslavement to it but like many others, I don't buy into ""Boxing Helena"" premise. Set mainly in this mansion of sorts, Cavanagh is Dr. Frankenstein and Helena is his ""creation."" Is his idealized woman one without arms and legs? Is beauty just skin deep? We never get a sense of ""why"" Nick is obsessed with her. He has a seemingly understanding girlfriend - why Helena over her. Additionally, Fenn's character of Helena is so underdeveloped and one-dimensional. She does okay in the part nevertheless. Sands' Nick is also at a loss as well. I'm thinking a derivative of a Norman Bates for the 1990s. With all his mother issues, you would think an intelligent man would seek a shrink asap. At least, his colleagues at the hospital should have noticed the doctor's odd behavior and institutionalized him on the spot. Poor Julian Sands - he is not a bad actor but seems to be stuck in some bad movie projects. Also, why is Art Garfunkel in this film!?!? Bill Paxton has a supporting role as Helena's studly, wannabe rocker/musician (?) boyfriend but he is also underutilized in the film except for acting out the macho man that Nick isn't apparently.
Also, one thing I did find hilarious are the extra-textual references to Sands' earlier film, Merchant-Ivory's A Room with a View (1986)in which he played the enigmatic hero George Emerson who romances and wins the young heroine Lucy Honeychurch, played by actress Helena Bonham-Carter! If you watch the film, pay attention to the soundtrack and dialogue.
Is Lynch taking a stab at Merchant-Ivory's polite notion of love's passions? Maybe and may not since there isn't any guiding focus to the film.

It is a story about obsession and the script completely presents that state of being. Jennifer Lynch had incredible insight when she made this film. Anyone who understands obsession can easily see that. Not only did she make the film interesting in and original, but she made it beautiful to look at. All the lighting,make up and sets are perfect. It has an ambiance of romance and depth, despite the fact we are dealing with one man's demons. The soundtrack is filled with opera and soothing original pieces by Graeme Revell(The Crow).

If you have never seen this movie, I will not spoil it for you.  I will say, though, that Helena is the perfect woman.  I mean perfect!  Literally every man's fantasy.
I wish I could say more, but you need to be surprised when you see it.  Get it.  Today.  You won't be sorry.",1003968000,4,490,4.08421052631579

Then the star change to Sherilyn Fenn, another lovely actress but apparently her star power in nowhere near miss Basinger as the movie did miserably in box office. But the movie itself is good about an obsessive doctor played by Julian Sand who stop at nothing to be together with a lovely girl played by Sherilyn Fenn. David Lynch's daughter direct. The DVD deserved a second chance. But this is not unrated version like the Laser disc.",1002758400,7,586,4.754901960784314
532512,5,6302987857,"The more people say they hate this movie, the more I love it.
But I must warn you, this is not the uncut version or even the director's cut. To get that you need to find the Laserdisc collection that came with commentary, extra ""dirty"" scenes(which are great btw) and the package-only 24KT musical score by the wonderful Graeme Revell. I really loved the music composed for this film, and it's terrible that this is the only way you can obtain this great score. The commentary is quite insightful, J Sands pops in for a bit to chat about it with Jennifer. For her 1st film, I thought Jennifer did a superb job handling everything from the actors, to the lush sets, editing, etc. Fenn, Paxton and Sands are all in prime form here, I really couldn't ask for anything more!!
Enjoy, and scream for ""HELENNA!!""

7833864,1,6302987857,"This sure was a movie. what it's about is a 'spoiler alert'. there is no box. Sherilyn Fenn is in it playing her usual typecast 'femme fatale' self as 'Helena'. a 'very wealthy' guy is 'obsessed' with her even though he doesn't know her and she apparently 'despises' him. she leaves to go to mexico and discovers some 'important' phonebook missing. wealthy man has it. she returns to his house to get it and as she leaves she is hit by a pickup truck that mangles her legs. cut to her in a 'wheelchair' inside mr. wealthy's house. it appears he's chopped her legs off (he's a surgeon) and now has her to himself. she obviously and understandably 'hates him' even 'more'. this is the scenario of the movie until he even chops her arms off!!!! her ex or current (who knows) boyfriend/plaything finds out where she is. he attacks mr. wealthy until a large, heavy statue of 'venus de milo' (haha) crashes down on him. cut to mr. wealthy waking up in a chair in the hospital he'd REALLY taken Helena to after the accident. he is not injured but merely awaiting word on Helena's condition. we have a flash real of the accident and the ambulance ride to the hospital. It was, after all, in the end, just a 'fantasy'.",1486512000,,1209,4.45045045045045

7833866,5,6302987857,"I like Julian Sands and discovered this film while seeking out something he's done besides the Warlock movies. I'm not a big fan of love stories. But if I'm going to watch one I want to see something erotic, unusual, amusing and with some danger, thank you! That's why I chose to order Boxing Helena and I was definitely not disappointed. At first I thought that Julian Sands and Sherylin Fenn were one of the more amusing comedy teams I'd seen in a while. But gradually it gets more serious and spooky once he has her in his possession. Because he is certainly doing some evil to this unfortunate lady. Yet he is almost always impeccably polite to her no matter how verbally she castigated him. I could never do such a thing to anyone who I loved, anyone period. He takes her from a bold, beautiful, free spirited woman to a person who feels she nolonger has any worth at all. I won't tell the ending save to say I for one was glad of it turning out as it did. For me this was a great story about the terror and destruction of obsessive love. I know from experience that it truly never ends until the stalker dies. I like this screen play was written by a young lady, the daughter of David Lynch and that she directed it at age 25. I like to see young women making something of themselves, it's inspiring. I was saddened to hear she really got made fun of for this film. I heard she even won a golden tomato award for worst director. She didn't deserve it. Neither did Helena just for attracting the wrong man.",1475107200,5,1511,4.3052631578947365
