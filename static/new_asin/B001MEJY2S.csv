8321318,4,B001MEJY2S,"Please note that this review concentrates mainly on the DVD quality rather than the movie itself.

I might be the world's only Evalyn Knapp fan...which means I was a soft touch for this one coming out on DVD. I wasn't expecting much, I admit. I'm pleased with the DVD, despite its flaws - it exceeded my expectations. The source print is not VHS tape, as I pessimistically anticipated. In fact, it might even be sourced from a 35mm print, it's difficult to tell for sure. If it's 16mm, it's surprisingly sharp. Contrast is very good. The print's not cleaned up at all, not that any restoration was expected, so there are vertical scratches, plenty of speckling and dirt (especially around reel changes, of course), and some occasional mild frame shaking. The worst problem is the frequent splices...in the first reel alone, there are probably a dozen or more splices where we lose a few seconds of the movie. Fortunately this problem disappears almost completely, after the 20 minute mark.

The main menu is a motion menu with a brief loop of background music (unrelated to the film). There are three choices: Play, Scenes, and Slides. Scene (chapter) menus are animated, and there are 12 chapter selections spread over two pages. ""Slides"" is just a series of frame captures from the film, presented with random transitions over an even more random musical selection unrelated to the film. It runs 2 minutes and 36 seconds, but is a waste of time if you've watched the film.

The movie itself is nothing remarkable, but it's pleasing enough, quite typical of the comedy/romances of the 1930s. Gags that at least make you smile if not laugh, mistaken identities, comic mishaps and the like.",1254355200,4,1689,4.837370242214533
