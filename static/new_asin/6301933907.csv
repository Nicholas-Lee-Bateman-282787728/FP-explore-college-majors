When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.

A traveling minstrel troupe comes to town, and they announce that they will lead a ""Fraggle Medley."" Each fraggle is to contribute his/her own unique song, and when put together they will make a beautiful 'medley.' Red Fraggle is terrified when she learns that her melody is something she has to hear inside herself, and not something she can get from anywhere else. She steals the leader's magic flute to see if it contains her song, and this leads her to misadventures. She has to confess, and then finally learns to hear her own song from within herself. Hers and all the other fraggle melodies, when blended, do make a beautiful sound and all ends happily.",1163376000,,855,4.5519480519480515
