It really speaks to the restorative power of art, but also about Tim Rollins' belief in these kids long term, and how important that has been to them.  We need more teaching like this in our world.  Lorie Hammond, Director, Peregrine School, Davis, Ca",1428105600,,309,4.685185185185185
8117065,4,B000F3VZAG,"This is a very interesting DVD about a very interesting project, of the kind that I particularly like (using the arts to benefit individuals and allow them to participate).  I would have given it five stars except that the ""story line"" isn't quite as clear as I'd like.  But--it's good and well worth seeing.",1316476800,2,308,4.685185185185185
