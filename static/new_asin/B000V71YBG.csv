8476823,5,B000V71YBG,"We used this DVD in the classroom along with the Suzanne Tate book, Danny & Daisy Dolphin. The children enjoyed seeing their favorite characters in animated form. The video also uses CGI animation and live action characters and tells a good story. This is the first in a series, according to the producers. I'm looking forward to more adventures of Suzanne Tate's Nature Series in animated form. A great product and useful for educators. Highly recommended.",1189382400,2,457,5.026315789473684
