8576721,5,B00C2U6E06,I try to get any Muddy Waters dvds. I was lucky to see him twice and his live act was such a thrill. Dvd is a really good live show and one of later day ones so Muddy is at his best. A must for Muddy fans.,1468454400,,205,3.382978723404255

8576724,5,B00C2U6E06,"I've been trying to get any Muddy footage I can, after starting my collection with ""Checkerboard Lounge"". I found this great concert on line; ""Muddy Waters - Live Dortmund, Germany 29/10/1976"" but couldn't search it any way for Purchase. While compiling my Muddy wish list off of Amazon, I took a shot with this DVD and was thrilled to find; ""This is It!"" For whatever reason there is no direct reference to it, but I'm glad I now have it! This is My era for prime Muddy, he and the Band are ""DEAD ON' as they rip through many of the classics. Video and Sound Quality are pretty good.....can't get enough!",1387324800,3,605,4.45945945945946
8576725,4,B00C2U6E06,"I think the copyright for this video passed through several hands before Laser Media picked it up and brought to DVD. This would explain the massive ""LIVE"" in the top left corner of the picture. I like to think it serves as a friendly (if not obnoxiously obvious) reminder that this live concert is 'LIVE'. This isn't the only issue I have with the picture. You get a lot of camera angles and introductions to the soloists when they take center stage displaying their talents but the picture is fuzzy. No remastering went into the visual aspect of this release at all.

The focus of this release is on the sound which is crisp. Track listing from the back cover is as follows:

Intro-After Hours
Soon Forgotten
Howlin' Wolf Blues
Hoochie Coochie Man
Blow Wind Blow
Can't Get No Grindin
Long Distance Call
Got My Mojo Workin'
Got My Mojo Workin' (special version)
Theme
Got My Mojo Workin' (70's version)

You do get a lot of music and it is not spliced up and edited with snippets of interviews thrown in like a lot of concert/music movie docs were prior to DVDs

This isn't the best Muddy Water DVD around (this is IMO&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Muddy-Waters-Classic-Concerts/dp/B000BM7U82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Muddy Waters: Classic Concerts</a>&nbsp;) but it is on the better end of the scale of good and bad.",1373587200,4,1365,5.1076233183856505
8576726,3,B00C2U6E06,Someone who decided to put a huge logo on the upper left side of this concert DVD sure knows how to mess up a great concert DVD.  Otherwise great audio and video.,1372464000,3,162,4.0625
