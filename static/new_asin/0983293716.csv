7795168,1,0983293716,"This Second( or Third) generation copy lacks Image quality that would be contained in a first generation copy.  The film has mulltiple scratches and other artifacts not in the original.  I am one of the two Hycon employees who filmed 17,000 feet of 16 mm footage in utmost secrecy in what has since become known as  'Area 51'.  The film was classified for 36 years  before being declassified after four years of appeals through the Freedom of Information Act.  I'm embarassed to see this shoddy dupe for sale.",1361491200,,509,4.7272727272727275

I would love to review this DVD.  I live in UK and have been fascinated by this aircraft since it first got to Britain.  I used to watch it take off from Akrotiri in Cyprus.

But I can't review it, because Amazon won't dispatch to UK.  It's not available to Amazon.co.uk.

What a shame, but Amazon, if you care about customer relations, you should really act as middle man and facilitate transactions such as this.  I'm happy to pay for the work required.  I ALWAYS pay my way.",1317600000,2,689,5.752475247524752
