6427409,5,B00KH738PK,"I really enjoy this series. Up until my introduction to Vytas, Travis Elliot was my favorite instructor to watch [though there are a few others I enjoy on the Udaya website]. (Travis Elliot: Short & Sweet / Ultimate Yogi). My review below includes Vytas' Udaya videos [a lot on there!] and this DVD series.

What I enjoy about this instructor/series:
-while guiding through pose he provides tips on how to better create the pose
-pleasant voice (very important to me)
-little, low key, or no music. (the Udaya subscription vids do not have that I've noticed, the series does)
-Moderate to very advanced (my opinion) in this series. You can modify when they are just too far above your level.

All around good series. Definitely a set to use over and over.",1406937600,3,755,4.712121212121212
6427410,5,B00KH738PK,"Udaya Entertainment has now put out three yoga DVD's for practice outside a studio. I am familiar with 2. ""The Ultimate Yogi"", and ""Deepen Your Practice"". I can tell you right of the bat that these DVD's are by far the best that you can buy right now! I am sure ""Warrior 365"" is just as good as well!  About this series:  This practice is geared for a yogi that is just past the intermediate level and looking to improve to the next level. But of course, that doesn't mean that someone more advanced or, as most of us are, less advanced can't buy this and not benefit. Someone very advanced and not familiar with Vytas will like the opportunity to practice at home under the direction of a good teacher covering more advanced poses and sequences. They will like yoga instruction and cues offered in a new way.  An intermediate yogi will love the challenge. They may not be able to do everything in each class but these videos offer great guidance on how to get into the tough poses. Of course, if full expression is not available for an individual, Vytas does a good job of explaining modifications with or without a block or strap. Any yogi just starting out or does not practice very often will find this series difficult. I would highly recommend that they just watch each DVD first. Then practice along with each DVD doing only what they can do. In other words really know your limitations, and move and transition into each pose slowly and mindfully.  Experienced yogis even do this to avoid injury.  Don't forget to BREATHE!!
 Hips class: I was a little surprised regular pigeon pose was not in the class.
 Core class: This will be my favorite. This class will make certain arm balances and handstands more manageable.
Inversions class: Know your limitations! These poses take time to learn. If in doubt, use a wall.
Backbends class: You could also call this Chest Openers class!  Use a wall if new to Scorpion pose. Be warmed up for this one.
Twists class: Benefits here don't necessarily show up on the outside. But your insides will love it!!!  Use caution if pregnant!
Gentle, intermediate, and strong Balanced Flow along with Short and Sweet 1,2,3: Poses learned and performed in the other lessons are put together in more of a flow sequence.
The Advanced Practice: The world would be a better place if we all did this!!
  Vytas does not cue the breath with movement in this series as much as I would have liked. But his instructions are clear and concise. I thought the setting was a bit boring. But the times I did find myself checking the screen the more I did not mind the simple setting. My focus was better able to zero in on one of the yogis and to what Vytas was saying. I found it very odd that I did not see much sweat drip of any of the yogis??  Sweat certainly came off me!!
  I am looking forward to practicing at home with these DVD's as my guide. They will also prove to be invaluable for me as I am aspiring to one day teach yoga. NAMASTE!!!!",1404432000,21,2969,4.463955637707948

8658826,5,B00KH738PK,"I bought this because I have Ulitmate Yogi and I thought this would be a natural progression from it.  It's actually quite different.  To compare Ulimate Yogi and Deepen Your Practice w/Vytas, I would have to say Ultimate Yogi is more for the intermediate yogi (not necessarily intermediate fitness level, but more towards those who haven't mastered, or aren't quite ready for the advanced Yoga poses).  Ulitmate Yogi gives those Intermediate Yogis a challenging strength (and even some cardio) workout that will deliver results (I love it!).  Deepen Your Practice is just what the title says.  The practice prepares the Intermediate/low-level advanced yogi for those more advanced poses.  You spend more time holding poses and preparing the body to transition into the more advanced poses.  Vytas does an excellent job with explaining how to prepare for the more advanced poses and, in  many cases, he has modifications that can be used while you work up to the more advanced poses.  The challenge is quite different from Ultimate Yogi as you need the strength, patience, flexibility, and calmness in order to progress in this practice.  All in all, it is a good series.  Vytas is a very good instructor and if you are patient and persistent, he will guide you to the next level of your practice.",1413331200,7,1297,4.958333333333333
8658827,5,B00KH738PK,"I was recently asked to describe DYP in a forum where ""The Ultimate Yogi"" is the primary ""go-to.""
UY is amazing and transformed my life.  Truly fantastic and so very different from DYP.
DYP is incredibly powerful and second to none.
My I am now 217 days consecutive on the mat for 1-3 hours per day (depending on time).  I still do UY Hardcore 3 x per week, but in that I was asked to describe Vytas I thought to post it here as well:

Well then,
DYP is for all levels, but I strongly suggest some prior experience.
If you have done UY you are ready for DYP.
Vytas is a fantastic instructor.  You will also fall in love with his voice.  He also teaches you the true names of the poses which I love.
He concentrates on form in an almost Iyengar style (He even mentions Iyengar in a few of the practices) which he weaves into a great flow practice.
Through his instruction and cueing I have been able to get into postures that I never would have thought possible.  He shows you how and it is really in the set up.
There are three levels of 'generalized' flow class: Gentle, Intermediate and Advanced.
In these, you can choose from either a 20 minute practice or a full hour.
I find the 20 minute practices good, but way too short The hour practices are simply fantastic.
In addition to the three, generalized flow practices he has target specific flow practices at an hour a shot: Hips, Twists, Core, Inversions and backbends.
Thus far, I have yet to try the inversions class or the advanced.
Maybe I will try one tomorrow ( ;) ).
The core class is awesome.  It too is an hour and he says in the middle, ""Come on.  You chose this class.  You wanted to do this...""
It is really good and he weaves yoga into a core instruction so nicely (PS-The intermediate flow starts right off with about 10 minutes of core and it's pretty tough).
He also has a video that you can watch within each section to introduce the basic concepts for each class and the proper alignments as well as common ""mistakes.""  No doubt, the man takes his yoga seriously and he brings a totally different flavor.  I love him though.  Totally different from Travis.
Travis' meditation is 30 minutes guided.
Vytas' mediation is 30 minutes silence.
Travis' set is lush and the music is powerful.
Vytas' set is sparse (almost prison film) and, as I noted, the soundtrack is like that from a 70's porn (again...not like I would know he said whistling).
I can honestly say that it has really delivered on ""Deepening"" my practice.
The man has impeccable cueing and he is totally devoted to his art.
Side-note: he is a recovering drug addict of nine years.  He attributes not dying from this to having found his practice.
It is a beautiful thing he brings and I promise it really will bring you to the next level.
I now go in and out of DYP and UY as well as Bikram and Vinyasa flow classes.  I stay consistent with Hardcore 3x a week even if I did the Vytas Core class.
I cannot say enough about the DVDs.
They are truly a blessing and come with my highest recommendations for a person who wants to take that next step.
I hope that was helpful!
Namaste~

Edit (addition from my yoga journaling): Round (Infinity) Day 218: OK, just finished Vytas: Strong and Advanced class over lunch. ""Strong"" is a good word for it. Hard to remember everything I just moved through, but he incorporated Bakasana (Crow Pose) into Surya Namascara B (x3). He had us move into tripod headstand from prasarita padottanasana A. Inversions are, of course, a part. I chose pincha mayurasana. If you chose headstand you were asked to tap your toes. Several wrap variations. Multiple planks, two of which moved directly from plank into vashistasana b. That is only what I can remember to write down now.
Wow good stuff.",1412121600,21,3751,4.4554744525547445
8658828,5,B00KH738PK,"The more I do yoga, the more I want to do yoga.  It's the one exercise that never loses its appeal.  I don't have the luxury of going to live yoga classes, but this series is the closest to the real thing.

Why I love this practice:

* Vytas is a master instructor.  He has it all:  the soothing voice, the explicit instruction and the gentle demeanor.

* The form tips have really taken me deeper into my practice.  I never really realized how complex yoga is; each posture has many layers.  I learn something new each time I do one of these workouts.

* I am getting stronger and more flexible by the week.  I was pretty strong and flexible before doing this practice.  I have done a few rounds of Travis' ""Ultimate Yogi"" and Rudy's ""Warrior 365.""  I loved both of those sets.  They are both good training for this set.

* The workout structure.  I love how Vytas has a short, 3 minute meditation at the end.  I'll admit it; I am a hyper person and find it almost impossible to sit still for meditation.  After doing each workout, I am blissed-out and calm, so I am able to sit still for 3 minutes and not fidget.

* It challenges me in ways I never thought possible.  Never in a million years did I believe that I could do a handstand.  Well, consistent practice has made this a reality for me.  Never mind that I am only upside down for a very short time, but it's much more than I ever did.

My only caution on this series is that is definitely not for beginners, or even low-intermediate yoga practitioners.  Vytas does give some modifications, but to get the most out of this series, you need to be familiar and able to do many of the standard yoga poses.

Here's a summary of my impressions of each of the practices.

HIPS
I have mild osteoarthritis and bursitis in my hips.  In spite of lots of stretching, my hips are very tight.  This practice has helped to open up my hips.

CORE
I dislike core work, but I do it anyway because of the great things it does for my core.  A note here:  you are spending a lot of time on your wrists, so this could aggravate them.  I place my hands on hexagon dumbbells to take some of the pressure off my wrists.

INVERSIONS
I was afraid to try this practice, but I am so glad I did.  Yes the focus is on inversions, but you spend maybe 10 minutes out of the hour actually doing inversions.  I felt so strong and accomplished after finishing this workout.  For several weeks, I couldn't even attempt a hand stand.  I would just stay in downward dog.
This practice embodies what yoga is all about; it's the journey, not the end result.  Even attempting inversions is good.

TWISTS
I have had some medical issues, so I've had to take some pretty heavy duty painkillers.  They were necessary, but I wanted to get them out of my system as quickly as possible.  This twisting class is perfect for that, since it is a great detoxing practice.

GENTLE PRACTICE
Well yes, it is somewhat gentle, but your results will be wonderful.  I feel super relaxed after doing this workout.

The main practice is about an hour, but there is also a 20 minute Gentle practice on the DVD as well.

INTERMEDIATE PRACTICE
I love this routine when I want a challenge, but not a super challenge.  It is very different from the Gentle Practice.

The main routine is about an hour, but there is also a 20 minute Intermediate practice on the DVD.

ADVANCED PRACTICE
I'll admit it, I was nervous about trying this routine since I thought it would be too hard for me and I would get frustrated.  Well, I am surprised and happy to say that this is my favorite of all the routines!

Sure there are advanced poses like head stands, but Vytas leads you into these with easier moves.  I stayed with the easier moves and still got a fabulous workout.

The main practice is about 67 minutes, but there is also a 20 minute Advanced practice on the DVD.

I highly recommend this set for anyone wanting to go further into their yoga practice.  Each DVD is different, yet they all make me feel so wonderful after I'm done.",1411257600,19,4022,4.334677419354839
