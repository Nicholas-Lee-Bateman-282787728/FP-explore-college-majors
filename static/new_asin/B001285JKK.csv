8244719,1,B001285JKK,"Whether you know anything about Quickstep (which I do) or not, you will not learn anything from this video.  Only the first 20 minutes (out of about 50) cover quickstep.  The rest is kind of an advertisement for other instructional dance videos they offer -- giving you little snippets of dances ranging from cha cha to Texas two step.  They even make up dances I never heard of.

Even the first 20 minutes of quickstep are wasted because they never tell you what step they are doing!  When they put it all together it is a V-6, but youd never know it unless you already knew the step.  They certainly don't tell you.

I don't begrudge the Russian accents or the questionable taste in clothes, but I am totally disgusted with the lack of information that this video offers.  I also worry what neophyte dancers will think when this couple introduces ludicrous names for dances that don't even exist.",1404086400,,898,4.60377358490566
8244720,3,B001285JKK,"Not a bad video for the price, however the steps / figures are not named.  Figures are titled ""Move #1"", ""Move #2"", and so on.

That might not be a major issue unless you prefer a more formal syllabus as I do, or you want to discuss a figure with an instructor or another dancer without showing him / her the video.",1319068800,,315,4.064516129032258
