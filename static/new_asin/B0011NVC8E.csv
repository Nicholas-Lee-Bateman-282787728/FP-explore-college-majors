3067429,5,B0011NVC8E,"This video really gives you a good workout, you can really feel it in the targeted areas!  I can pick and choose what I want to work on for that day. I have acually made a daily schedule on a dry erase board but you can download one of his workout schedules for this dvd for free on his web site.  I have had it a month and still have not done all the workouts. I like that all you need is 2 pairs of weights one light set and one heaver set and yourself not alot of extra things to buy like with other workout videos.",1213747200,3,518,3.8317757009345796
3067430,4,B0011NVC8E,"I tend not to rely too much on workout videos, but this one is getting a lot of use. First, you can hardly go wrong with Gilad.  His knowledge, professionalism, and reassuring personality shine through the tv.  ""Express Workouts"" is two discs with a collection of under ten-minute segments, each focusing on a different fitness component or muscle group.  I really like being able to customize my own workouts, so this is perfect.  You can do a ten minute segment if that's all the time you have, or you can combine several segments to your taste.

Some of the segments are ambiguously named, and the sequence seems a bit off.  For instance, ""Dynamic Moves"" is a fast paced segment of oppositional movements which I think is better described as cardio, but there's an isometric segment in between it and the other two cardio segments.  However, once you have viewed all the parts and have gotten a good feel for them, this inconsistency is easily overcome by merely forwarding the dvd to the part you want.  Recommended.

I'd like to add a plea to Gilad and all fitness video producers.  I want captions!  I like to listen to my own music, and captions would be an enormous help.",1213056000,14,1179,4.647342995169082
3067431,5,B0011NVC8E,"I love Gilad.  These workouts are quick & effective.  I tend to be pressed for time many days and don't often have 30 minutes or more to workout.  The cardio workouts (9 minutes each) WILL leave you sweating.  This is great for days when you want to get something in, but just don't have the time.  I highly recommend!",1208908800,5,318,4.322033898305085
3067432,5,B0011NVC8E,"This dvd set is just what I needed to begin and maintain a convenient,  flexible exercise program in my own home. There is something for everyone who is either at a beginning or intermediate level. The programs can be used in any combination that one requires. Being a 55 year old beginner, I am using Warm Up, Cardio Basic, Dynamic Moves, and Core Foundations for a great 30 minute workout every day.

There are a few speaking and action mistakes (for you perfectionists out there) but nothing that detracts from the effectiveness of the segments included on the dvds. Since they were taped live on location, these little blips seem quite natural.

I highly recommend this product.",1208390400,6,682,4.811965811965812
3067433,5,B0011NVC8E,"This is the best idea ever!  With two toddlers, I never know how much time I'll have to exercise.  It's great to have so much flexibility in my workout but still have a DVD to motivate and teach me.  Yes, you may have to change DVDs in the middle but I'm having so much fun with the ""Choose your own Adventure"" style that I don't care.  I also skip the cool down and just stretch on my own so that prevents a DVD switch.  He has a schedule available for download on his website but it has a lot of typos and I think he has too much upper body in the middle of the week so I came up with my own basic schedule and I adjust as I go along.  There's also a better description of each workout segment on his website so you might want to check that out too.  The weight training segments (which are fabulous and are individually adjustable since you can use any weight or sometimes none at all) are definitely better than the cardio, but the dynamic exercise segment is really a third cardio segment and it's really good.  If you like his ""Total Body Sculpt"" show, you won't be disappointed.  If you haven't seen his show, buy these and find out why so many people love this guy.",1208131200,6,1173,4.154867256637168
3067434,2,B0011NVC8E,"His workout video Interval Training is one of my favorite workouts, I use it 3 times a week and don't grow tired of it...so when this came out I was excited to get it.  Disappointment ensued.  I tried it twice and likely won't put it in again.  The background women look identical like they are out of a Simply Irresistible 80's video, dressed alike, no individual personalities.  They keep making funny faces and are distracting.
I didn't like the format of the videos either.  Warm up and Cool down are on one disk and cardio on another.  So you have to pop video one in, warm up, video 2 in workout, video one back in to do cool down.",1207180800,74,637,4.310924369747899
3067435,5,B0011NVC8E,"I really liked these short, targeted workouts that let you pick what to work on in roughly 10 minute intervals.  For days when you don't have a lot of time, they are terrific.  Unlike the DVD's converted from the TV shows, these are clearly meant to be used all the way through.  I'd love more DVD's like this that give you options!",1207008000,3,332,4.32258064516129
3067436,5,B0011NVC8E,The best yet!  Some of it familiar and some new moves.  It will really wear you out even if you have been doing older Gilad videos.  I love it!  Fast paced and really well balanced.,1205625600,7,181,4.085714285714285

It is the same Gilad with no nonsense exercises that I have no problem following.  If you like the fittv Gilad workouts, you will like this DVD set.

3067488,4,B0011NVC8E,"I have been exercising with Gilad since the mid-80s when he first came on TV - I cannot say enough great things about his workouts!  I love these short Express workouts that you can mix and match to customize for your own fitness goals and the amount of time you want to spend.  However, I hate that I have to keep stopping and changing DVDs during my workout.  For example, the warmup is on DVD 1, but then I have to stop and put in DVD 2 for the Cardio Basic workout, then stop and switch back to DVD 1 for the Buns & Thighs workout and Cool Down.  That is two switches during a 30 minute workout!  And the worst part is that on DVD 1 you have to listen to the intro each time with Gilad introducing himself etc - can't just go straight to the workout - totally wrecks the flow of the workout.  It is enough of a pain that I don't use the DVDs very often even though I LOVE the workouts.  I have a yoga DVD by Shiva Rea (Daily Energy Vinyasa Flow Yoga) that has this incredible ""matrix"" that allows me to choose whichever segments (warm-up, cool down, etc) of her DVD I want to watch and the order I want to do them, and then I hit Start and the DVD automatically goes from one segment to the next without my having to do a thing once I start!  It is awesome and I WISH Gilad would create an express workout DVD with the matrix feature!!!",1398384000,2,1340,4.049242424242424

3067512,5,B0011NVC8E,"We've been following Gilad on TV and tape for many years.  He continues to inspire, and keep up to date with changes in exercise routines.

3067513,5,B0011NVC8E,"I love this workout DVD. Each workout targets the muscles to build but don't overwork it. I use it as an extra with my aerobics. And on those days when I don't have much time for a complete workout, I just pick the part of the body I want to work on and get great satisfaction. This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",1372896000,,308,4.15
3067514,5,B0011NVC8E,"These short workouts are great for me.  They actually make me do more, because each time I finish one, I ususally say, ""well, I've got a few more minutes, I'll do another one."" There is a good variety, I can pick and choose each night which ones I want to work on, or just hit Play All and keep going. My only negative comment is that they should have put the Warm Up and Cool down on each CD, but I have worked out enough I know how to do my own so it doesn't really bother me.",1372032000,,478,3.877551020408163
3067515,5,B0011NVC8E,"This is a great workout DVD!  I use disc 1 as one workout and disc 2 as another workout, on alternating days (similar to the 45/45 split workout, which is one of my favorites).  WOW!  The workouts are challenging and effective!  I originally bought this DVD to add  an additional 10 or 20 minutes to other workouts, which I may do in the future, but for now,  I'm getting great results using it as two complete workouts.  Each workout takes about an hour+- and I would say that  they are high intermediate to advanced workouts.  I strongly recommend this DVD!  I hope that Gilad will make a 60/60 split routine workout and some more 45/45 split workouts...  This is the perfect system/formula.",1370304000,2,693,4.598360655737705
3067516,4,B0011NVC8E,"I've been avidly working out for a little over 2 yrs.  Started up w/ Debbie Siebers Slim in 6 (followed by her ""Keep it Up"" etc dvds) & I liked her style. Then I switched to Jillian and Jackie (my faves of theirs being ""Banish Trouble Zones"" and ""Power Circuit Training"", respectively). I think they are a little easier than Debbie's 2nd series. After taking a break for an unrelated back injury I resumed workouts w/ P-90 (not X). It was okay but after several weeks became boring. I enjoyed the P-90 Fat Burning System dvd the most.  While I enjoy MOST of Tony Horton's actual exercises & workout 'moves', I do not particularly enjoy his goofy personality.

Enter Gilad. I LOVE his style. Straight-forward, simple moves with concise direct CALM instruction and no silly b.s. or excess chatter. I enjoy the circuits on this dvd and the time for each seemingly goes by very quickly...so quickly that I wouldn't mind if they were a bit longer but I always do more than one. One good thing about several short circuits is that regardless of your time limitations, you have the ability to formulate a custom workout so, no excuses. Even if you can only warm-up and cardio, its better than nothing!!!

The ONLY thing I do not like about this set is that there are 2 separate dvds. For me this routinely means, DVD 1 - warmup, stop, replace w/ DVD 2 - cardio & abs, stop, replace DVD 1, cool down.  As mentioned by another reviewer, ideally, it would all be on one pre-programmable dvd but its not. Does that keep me from loving the workouts?  Not at all!!! So if you like the same instructors as I, for the same reasons, give this a try!

***UPDATE/EDIT:  Each 'circuit' is approximately 9 mins. Warm-up (approx 8:00) and Cool-down (approx. 5:00) together add 14 mins to exercise program(s). On Gilad's website you can get suggested schedule/workout combinations.  Most of the 2 exercise days run about 18 mins (in addition to warm-up and cool down - total approx 33 mins). Three exercise days run about 28 mins (plus warm up & cool down).

I've been using this program 4-5 days a week for almost 2 mos and still enjoy it very much.  I also think that changing the dvd between circuits, while a bit tedious, may even help it to seem a wee bit less monotonous and you feel a bit more in control b/c you actually know what you're going to be working next (as its up to you).

*** Update: After working out w/ Gilad for 2-3 months I have to say that I'm not seeing any great results so I'm moving on. I also used his Quick Fit program for a while after this one and while I DO enjoy working out w/ Gilad, I think these dvds are geared more towards beginners. They have greatly helped me to prepare myself to move on after a minor back injury but they are not challenging enough for me.",1367280000,6,2778,4.425490196078432
3067517,5,B0011NVC8E,"I love Gilad's daily workouts on TV and this is going to be a great supplement when I just want to target an area or two, Now that I am a few years older and more out of shape, I appreciate programs that work but aren't too lengthy...this fits the bill.",1361318400,,253,3.980392156862745
3067528,4,B0011NVC8E,Great videos - don't like having to change the cd to get the other workouts but is nice to have all the options.,1357776000,,112,3.9130434782608696
3067529,5,B0011NVC8E,"This is good for work mornings when i only want to do the warmup and then about a 10 minute specific workout for arms or shoulders whatever.  Even the warm up feels like a good workout!  But I have a desk job so.....  He starts out easy and then the difficult moves kind of sneak up on you!  I did this for about 2 years then stopped due to life, so just started up again.  I tell you the fitness seemed to stay with me the time i didn't do the exercises - I also had knee surgery about 6 months ago and he does do squats and knee bends but i just do the best i can.  The background of the beach is great!  Gilad is inspirational and pushes you to do what you can - he has a good voice for this and he's not whiney - he is also in great shape along with his exercise people too!",1355616000,,778,3.7950310559006213

3067531,5,B0011NVC8E,These two DVDs offer a wide range of exercise choices. You can opt to work on specific areas or do one (or both) of the DVD workouts for a full body experience.  I'm so happy to have the option of using these DVDs on days that I can't make it to an exercise class. Gilad does a great job demonstrating the exercises and the setting is pleasant and relaxing.,1354838400,,357,4.173913043478261

3067533,5,B0011NVC8E,"I really love the format of this workout dvd. Each workout is around 10 minutes and focuses on a part of your body or on your cardiovascular health.

Gilad's workouts changed my body.",1353542400,,345,4.40625
3067534,4,B0011NVC8E,"This DVD is great for guiding you through a complete weight work out.  the instructions and visual are clear and easy to follow.  All of the exercises are right on target.  The cardio component is ok but I am not a fan of kickboxing - which there is a heavy influence of.  The warm up is awesome though and time does fly when you follow this.  Overall, I would highly recommend this and just got one for my sister.  An improvement would be the capacity to preprogram the order you do the weight work out in which is the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.",1339459200,,560,4.138888888888889
3067535,5,B0011NVC8E,"I bought this DVD set 2 years ago and use it at least twice a week to keep my workouts varied.  What I like about it is that I can mix and match which workouts I want to do and it can be used alone or in conjunction with other activities within my workout.  There are also days when I only have 20 minutes, so I can use it for those days, too.  Gilad is very educated about exercise techniques and which muscles a move will work.  His instruction is focused on form and getting the most out of your workout.  I highly recommend this DVD set if you want a set that will not sit on your shelf, but will be used consistently!  I would classify myself as an exerciser on the upper side of the intermediate level.",1325635200,2,708,4.057553956834532

3067550,3,B0011NVC8E,"I ordered this product for my girlfriend who is a huge fan of Gilad's work on television.  Upon receiving this dvd set for her birthday, we opened the package to find that it had been shipped with TWO disc TWO's, and not a disc one.  Contacting amazon, they immediately set me up with return shipping for the product and one day shipping on a new one.
The dvd did function perfectly, and she enjoyed several of the workouts on it.  There are times in this were there are only a few repetitions of an exercise, where one must pause the dvd and do more to actually benefit.  I don't know if that is because this is derived from a TV series and no longer has commercials or because they wanted to make the series fit on two dvd's, but it isn't that inconvenient.
Great product, and pending my return, I'm very satisfied with the price of this buy (the Gilad website sells these things at a much higher price @@ )",1286409600,,909,4.298245614035087

Usually, I do Bodies in Motion followed by Total Body Sculpt on FITtv, but I decided to purchase this DVD for when I either missed them or when traveling.
I really like this DVD because you can pick and choose / mix and match any workout. They are all short and effective. My personal favorite is the Dynamic moves.  If you are tired after work or in a slump, just do this quick 9 min. workout for an energy boost.",1282262400,2,570,4.04424778761062

3067556,5,B0011NVC8E,"This DVD set is a great buy for both workout quality and quantity. The DVD is well chaptered and you can go right to the specified workout and the workout starts right away. For some good ideas on how to use these DVDs, go to Gilad's website, click on Express Workouts and you can download 8 week rotations for beginner and intermediate.

Workouts: Don't be fooled by the 10 minute workouts - you will fatigue the muscle worked during each workout. The cardio workouts are fun and easy to follow and they will warm you up to do the resistance training, but they will not qualify as cardio workouts. I especially liked the core workouts. You will see some of Gilad's usual ab routines, but he throws in some Pilates and yoga exercises and works the back which many core workouts ignore. These were pretty thorough core workouts for 10 minutes.

Setting: Not Gilad's usual setting, but who can argue with an ocean view in Hawaii?

Music: Typical of Gilad's shows, the music is not exciting but not distracting or annoying.

Crew: There are different people working out in each section. There are always 2 people (both men and women) working out with Gilad who are always demonstrating perfect form.

Equipment Needed: You only need dumbbells for these workouts and a little space in front of your TV.

Instructor: Gilad is the best! He is positive and encouraging without being over the top or irritating. His cueing and explanation of proper form is excellent as always. He was a little more down to business and not as light hearted as he is on Fit TV.

I have used these DVDs over and over because there is no dread factor with these workouts and I know I am getting a good workout.",1264118400,21,1683,4.571428571428571

3067570,5,B0011NVC8E,I like the format of the video and the fact that each workout is very short.  It is much more likely that I will actually pick a routine to do when I know I only have to budget 10 minutes to get it in.  What generally happens is that once I do one then I realize I can go ahead and fit another section in.  Unlike other exercise videos that require a big block of time this one fills a need and eliminates some of my excuses.,1251417600,,425,3.8620689655172415

3067575,4,B0011NVC8E,"I have been working out with Gilad for many years. I used to tape his Bodies In Motion show and still use those tapes from time to time.  I like this production because the segments are short and I can use the warmup to prepare myself for my daily run.  I then can use one of the other segments for some cross-training or simply just finish things up with the stretch segment.  One thing that I do not understand is why the decision was made to go with two DVD's. Since the workout segments are short, why not capitalize on that aspect and put all segments on one disc?  But, in all, this is a set worth buying and using.",1230163200,2,621,4.15
3067576,4,B0011NVC8E,"Like other reviewers of Gilad's products, I was introduced to his no-frills aerobics workouts back in the nineties. I used to tape his ""Bodies in Motion"" and his sister's ""Basic Training"" workouts to use over the weekends. As my level of fitness improved, I moved on to other instructors. Then, life got more complicated. Knees became weaker and yoga replaced jogging and jumping.  For quite a number of years my Gilad tapes laid in the back of my closet collecting dust.  A couple of months ago, however, and while I was looking for a way to get some much needed aerobic conditioning without killing my knees, I rediscovered Gilad again.

Any  time-deprived fan of Gilad will appreciate ""Express Workouts.""  I certainly am.  This 2-DVD set features 15 workouts that are under 10 minutes each. I can combine different segments to fit my schedule and to concentrate on the body parts I need to strengthen. DVD 1 features an 8-minute warm up and then individual segments meant to tone and work the back, chest, arms, shoulders, buns, hips and tights.  You'll need a set of weights if you're doing DVD 1.

DVD 2 contains seven workouts. The first one, ""Dynamic Moves"" is a low impact workout. The moves (twists, squats, etc.) will certainly be familiar to those who have used other Gilad's DVDs.  The second segment, ""Strength & Balance"" is a yoga-inspired workout.  ""Basic Cardio 1"" is another low impact routine using grapevines, jump rope and boxing movements. ""Cardio 2-Challenge"" continues with the boxing and martial arts inspired movements. If you have done ""Gilad's Elite Forces Fat Burning Workout,"" you should have no problem doing both cardio segments back to back.  The fifth segment, ""Compound Strength"" combines lunges with biceps and triceps work.  In the final two segments, ""Core Foundations"" and ""Core Challenge,"" Gilad targets the abdominal area by doing crunches, roll ups and backstrokes.

As always, Gilad is excellent in his emphasis on form. What I miss from this DVD, however, was the synergy he and his exercise mates had in the earlier programs.  It made those old ""Bodies in Motion"" workouts on the beach lively and full of fun to watch and follow. Still, I recommend ""Express Workouts"" to anybody who is starting a fitness program and to those who'd like to mix and customize their workouts to fit time availability, mood or need.",1215129600,73,2356,4.931645569620253

I have acually made a daily schedule on a dry erase board but you can download one of his workout schedules for this dvd for free on his web site.  I have had it a month and still have not done all the workouts. I like that all you need is 2 pairs of weights one light set and one heaver set and yourself not alot of extra things to buy like with other workout videos.",1213747200,3,518,3.8317757009345796
3301927,4,B0011NVC8E,"I tend not to rely too much on workout videos, but this one is getting a lot of use. First, you can hardly go wrong with Gilad.  His knowledge, professionalism, and reassuring personality shine through the tv.  ""Express Workouts"" is two discs with a collection of under ten-minute segments, each focusing on a different fitness component or muscle group.  I really like being able to customize my own workouts, so this is perfect.  You can do a ten minute segment if that's all the time you have, or you can combine several segments to your taste.

Some of the segments are ambiguously named, and the sequence seems a bit off.  For instance, ""Dynamic Moves"" is a fast paced segment of oppositional movements which I think is better described as cardio, but there's an isometric segment in between it and the other two cardio segments.  However, once you have viewed all the parts and have gotten a good feel for them, this inconsistency is easily overcome by merely forwarding the dvd to the part you want.  Recommended.

I'd like to add a plea to Gilad and all fitness video producers.  I want captions!  I like to listen to my own music, and captions would be an enormous help.",1213056000,14,1179,4.647342995169082

Being a 55 year old beginner, I am using Warm Up, Cardio Basic, Dynamic Moves, and Core Foundations for a great 30 minute workout every day.

There are a few speaking and action mistakes (for you perfectionists out there) but nothing that detracts from the effectiveness of the segments included on the dvds. Since they were taped live on location, these little blips seem quite natural.

I highly recommend this product.",1208390400,6,682,4.811965811965812

It's great to have so much flexibility in my workout but still have a DVD to motivate and teach me.  Yes, you may have to change DVDs in the middle but I'm having so much fun with the ""Choose your own Adventure"" style that I don't care.  I also skip the cool down and just stretch on my own so that prevents a DVD switch.  He has a schedule available for download on his website but it has a lot of typos and I think he has too much upper body in the middle of the week so I came up with my own basic schedule and I adjust as I go along.  There's also a better description of each workout segment on his website so you might want to check that out too.  The weight training segments (which are fabulous and are individually adjustable since you can use any weight or sometimes none at all) are definitely better than the cardio, but the dynamic exercise segment is really a third cardio segment and it's really good.  If you like his ""Total Body Sculpt"" show, you won't be disappointed.  If you haven't seen his show, buy these and find out why so many people love this guy.",1208131200,6,1173,4.154867256637168

Disappointment ensued.  I tried it twice and likely won't put it in again.  The background women look identical like they are out of a Simply Irresistible 80's video, dressed alike, no individual personalities.  They keep making funny faces and are distracting.
I didn't like the format of the videos either.  Warm up and Cool down are on one disk and cardio on another.  So you have to pop video one in, warm up, video 2 in workout, video one back in to do cool down.",1207180800,74,637,4.310924369747899

3301985,4,B0011NVC8E,"I have been exercising with Gilad since the mid-80s when he first came on TV - I cannot say enough great things about his workouts!  I love these short Express workouts that you can mix and match to customize for your own fitness goals and the amount of time you want to spend.  However, I hate that I have to keep stopping and changing DVDs during my workout.  For example, the warmup is on DVD 1, but then I have to stop and put in DVD 2 for the Cardio Basic workout, then stop and switch back to DVD 1 for the Buns & Thighs workout and Cool Down.  That is two switches during a 30 minute workout!  And the worst part is that on DVD 1 you have to listen to the intro each time with Gilad introducing himself etc - can't just go straight to the workout - totally wrecks the flow of the workout.  It is enough of a pain that I don't use the DVDs very often even though I LOVE the workouts.  I have a yoga DVD by Shiva Rea (Daily Energy Vinyasa Flow Yoga) that has this incredible ""matrix"" that allows me to choose whichever segments (warm-up, cool down, etc) of her DVD I want to watch and the order I want to do them, and then I hit Start and the DVD automatically goes from one segment to the next without my having to do a thing once I start!

3302013,4,B0011NVC8E,"I've been avidly working out for a little over 2 yrs.  Started up w/ Debbie Siebers Slim in 6 (followed by her ""Keep it Up"" etc dvds) & I liked her style. Then I switched to Jillian and Jackie (my faves of theirs being ""Banish Trouble Zones"" and ""Power Circuit Training"", respectively). I think they are a little easier than Debbie's 2nd series. After taking a break for an unrelated back injury I resumed workouts w/ P-90 (not X). It was okay but after several weeks became boring. I enjoyed the P-90 Fat Burning System dvd the most.  While I enjoy MOST of Tony Horton's actual exercises & workout 'moves', I do not particularly enjoy his goofy personality.

Enter Gilad. I LOVE his style. Straight-forward, simple moves with concise direct CALM instruction and no silly b.s. or excess chatter. I enjoy the circuits on this dvd and the time for each seemingly goes by very quickly...so quickly that I wouldn't mind if they were a bit longer but I always do more than one. One good thing about several short circuits is that regardless of your time limitations, you have the ability to formulate a custom workout so, no excuses. Even if you can only warm-up and cardio, its better than nothing!!!

The ONLY thing I do not like about this set is that there are 2 separate dvds. For me this routinely means, DVD 1 - warmup, stop, replace w/ DVD 2 - cardio & abs, stop, replace DVD 1, cool down.  As mentioned by another reviewer, ideally, it would all be on one pre-programmable dvd but its not. Does that keep me from loving the workouts?  Not at all!!! So if you like the same instructors as I, for the same reasons, give this a try!

***UPDATE/EDIT:  Each 'circuit' is approximately 9 mins. Warm-up (approx 8:00) and Cool-down (approx. 5:00) together add 14 mins to exercise program(s). On Gilad's website you can get suggested schedule/workout combinations.  Most of the 2 exercise days run about 18 mins (in addition to warm-up and cool down - total approx 33 mins). Three exercise days run about 28 mins (plus warm up & cool down).

I've been using this program 4-5 days a week for almost 2 mos and still enjoy it very much.  I also think that changing the dvd between circuits, while a bit tedious, may even help it to seem a wee bit less monotonous and you feel a bit more in control b/c you actually know what you're going to be working next (as its up to you).

*** Update: After working out w/ Gilad for 2-3 months I have to say that I'm not seeing any great results so I'm moving on. I also used his Quick Fit program for a while after this one and while I DO enjoy working out w/ Gilad, I think these dvds are geared more towards beginners. They have greatly helped me to prepare myself to move on after a minor back injury but they are not challenging enough for me.",1367280000,6,2778,4.425490196078432

I don't know if that is because this is derived from a TV series and no longer has commercials or because they wanted to make the series fit on two dvd's, but it isn't that inconvenient.
Great product, and pending my return, I'm very satisfied with the price of this buy (the Gilad website sells these things at a much higher price @@ )",1286409600,,909,4.298245614035087
3302048,5,B0011NVC8E,"I have been working out with Gilad for about two years now and he is the best! He is very motivating and his workouts have me in the best shape of my life!
Usually, I do Bodies in Motion followed by Total Body Sculpt on FITtv, but I decided to purchase this DVD for when I either missed them or when traveling.
I really like this DVD because you can pick and choose / mix and match any workout. They are all short and effective. My personal favorite is the Dynamic moves.  If you are tired after work or in a slump, just do this quick 9 min. workout for an energy boost.",1282262400,2,570,4.04424778761062
3302049,4,B0011NVC8E,"I am so happy to be working out with Gilad again.  I'm disappointed that most of the TV shows are not on the air anymore because I worked out with Gilad for years!  He's got a positive attitude that is infectious and the moves aren't so complicated that they confuse you like some videos.  Simple, but effective routines with that great Hawaiian background and gorgeous Gilad!  What more could you want!?",1280966400,2,404,4.647887323943662
3302050,5,B0011NVC8E,You simply cannot go wrong wit this dvd  anyone can do these no nonsense work outs . Even if you have to sit in the chair to do it... it can be modified. Gilad is the person to get you motivated JUST FANTASTIC !,1269302400,,211,3.7954545454545454
3302051,5,B0011NVC8E,"My husband and I have worked out with Gilad for several years with buns of steel and arms of steel plus some of his other tapes. His new express workout is wonderful. We feel that we can do these workouts because of our previous workouts with him. Our arms and legs are strong. But it was time to mix it up a bit and this new CD fits the bill. We love the variety.

3302052,5,B0011NVC8E,I love this dvd it gives amazing results if you do it I have done an hr 4 times a week for 3 weeks and lost 8lbs its amazing best dvd i have had,1266105600,,144,3.264705882352941
3302053,5,B0011NVC8E,"This DVD set is a great buy for both workout quality and quantity. The DVD is well chaptered and you can go right to the specified workout and the workout starts right away. For some good ideas on how to use these DVDs, go to Gilad's website, click on Express Workouts and you can download 8 week rotations for beginner and intermediate.

Workouts: Don't be fooled by the 10 minute workouts - you will fatigue the muscle worked during each workout. The cardio workouts are fun and easy to follow and they will warm you up to do the resistance training, but they will not qualify as cardio workouts. I especially liked the core workouts. You will see some of Gilad's usual ab routines, but he throws in some Pilates and yoga exercises and works the back which many core workouts ignore. These were pretty thorough core workouts for 10 minutes.

Setting: Not Gilad's usual setting, but who can argue with an ocean view in Hawaii?

Music: Typical of Gilad's shows, the music is not exciting but not distracting or annoying.

Crew: There are different people working out in each section. There are always 2 people (both men and women) working out with Gilad who are always demonstrating perfect form.

Equipment Needed: You only need dumbbells for these workouts and a little space in front of your TV.

Instructor: Gilad is the best! He is positive and encouraging without being over the top or irritating. His cueing and explanation of proper form is excellent as always. He was a little more down to business and not as light hearted as he is on Fit TV.

I have used these DVDs over and over because there is no dread factor with these workouts and I know I am getting a good workout.",1264118400,21,1683,4.571428571428571
3302064,4,B0011NVC8E,"Excellent instruction, great variation, and great results.  Again, at the introduction, as in the other exercise video I purchased, the first part of the audio is missing.  Also missing is additional information that you would get if you purchased the video series directly from Gilad's website (You only get the DVD's)  I would have given the purchase a 5 star rating if everything was included.  Next time I will purchase directly from Gilad's website",1255219200,2,453,5.081081081081081
3302065,5,B0011NVC8E,"This Gilad's workout video is excellent. If you want to keep in shape and keep with your working life, this video is for you. It is divided in several exercises that you can select if you don't want to follow all exercises. I do it that way, I select some exercises and make them in the morning or at night. It helps me being healthy in my busy life!.",1251936000,,351,4.101449275362318
3302066,5,B0011NVC8E,Great CD. Has a number of workouts that are very powerful. Tough to get through all but you do see results as with all his CD's,1251936000,,127,3.923076923076923
3302067,5,B0011NVC8E,I like the format of the video and the fact that each workout is very short.  It is much more likely that I will actually pick a routine to do when I know I only have to budget 10 minutes to get it in.  What generally happens is that once I do one then I realize I can go ahead and fit another section in.  Unlike other exercise videos that require a big block of time this one fills a need and eliminates some of my excuses.,1251417600,,425,3.8620689655172415
3302068,4,B0011NVC8E,"This is the first DVD of Gilad's I have ever purchased but I was a regular viewer of his Bodies in Motion show.  This set of exercises is just as easy to follow as the ones on the show.  Gilad takes time to explain what you are doing before going on to another move, something that was not done on other exercise videos I recently purchased.  My only ""complaint"" is I wish there was a section for the light aerobics that were done on the show in the second segement.",1249862400,,466,4.155555555555556

3302072,4,B0011NVC8E,"I have been working out with Gilad for many years. I used to tape his Bodies In Motion show and still use those tapes from time to time.  I like this production because the segments are short and I can use the warmup to prepare myself for my daily run.  I then can use one of the other segments for some cross-training or simply just finish things up with the stretch segment.  One thing that I do not understand is why the decision was made to go with two DVD's. Since the workout segments are short, why not capitalize on that aspect and put all segments on one disc?  But, in all, this is a set worth buying and using.",1230163200,2,621,4.15
3302073,4,B0011NVC8E,"Like other reviewers of Gilad's products, I was introduced to his no-frills aerobics workouts back in the nineties. I used to tape his ""Bodies in Motion"" and his sister's ""Basic Training"" workouts to use over the weekends. As my level of fitness improved, I moved on to other instructors. Then, life got more complicated. Knees became weaker and yoga replaced jogging and jumping.  For quite a number of years my Gilad tapes laid in the back of my closet collecting dust.  A couple of months ago, however, and while I was looking for a way to get some much needed aerobic conditioning without killing my knees, I rediscovered Gilad again.

Any  time-deprived fan of Gilad will appreciate ""Express Workouts.""  I certainly am.  This 2-DVD set features 15 workouts that are under 10 minutes each. I can combine different segments to fit my schedule and to concentrate on the body parts I need to strengthen. DVD 1 features an 8-minute warm up and then individual segments meant to tone and work the back, chest, arms, shoulders, buns, hips and tights.  You'll need a set of weights if you're doing DVD 1.

DVD 2 contains seven workouts. The first one, ""Dynamic Moves"" is a low impact workout. The moves (twists, squats, etc.) will certainly be familiar to those who have used other Gilad's DVDs.  The second segment, ""Strength & Balance"" is a yoga-inspired workout.  ""Basic Cardio 1"" is another low impact routine using grapevines, jump rope and boxing movements. ""Cardio 2-Challenge"" continues with the boxing and martial arts inspired movements. If you have done ""Gilad's Elite Forces Fat Burning Workout,"" you should have no problem doing both cardio segments back to back.  The fifth segment, ""Compound Strength"" combines lunges with biceps and triceps work.  In the final two segments, ""Core Foundations"" and ""Core Challenge,"" Gilad targets the abdominal area by doing crunches, roll ups and backstrokes.

As always, Gilad is excellent in his emphasis on form. What I miss from this DVD, however, was the synergy he and his exercise mates had in the earlier programs.  It made those old ""Bodies in Motion"" workouts on the beach lively and full of fun to watch and follow. Still, I recommend ""Express Workouts"" to anybody who is starting a fitness program and to those who'd like to mix and customize their workouts to fit time availability, mood or need.",1215129600,73,2356,4.931645569620253

You will become familiar with his style of workouts. One of the best things about this one if you are short on time you can always do the Dynamic Moves for a full workout.

8242046,5,B0011NVC8E,"I have been exercising to Gilad for many, many, years.  I stopped for a while and tried other programs, but nothing works better than Gilad's exercise program for me.  He has always seemed down to earth and his partners on set seem more professional and less sexual (like some of the programs I've seen).  I would love to see him develop a program specifically geared to seniors, though.  I'm almost 60 and some of the exercises are getting a bit difficult.",1486252800,,457,4.604938271604938
8242047,4,B0011NVC8E,"This set is OK, but as far as much help it's pretty monotonous. If you turn the sound down, it helps some, because of...you know, the same old dialogue day after day. I use this set alongside his older tv show dvd's. One of these a day added onto that lets me get extra focus on hips, thighs and abs after doing a regular workout. I don't think I would rely on these as a sole exercise set, because there is no variety. Just one workout per body part. Some are good, some are so-so. I find all the upper body workouts so-so.

So, what you would get would be a select few muscle groups that you are working out, day after day with no variety. Then, you will end up with just a select few muscle groups firming up and the rest doing nothing.

That's just my opinion!  =)
