This is taken from a 16mm print and is MOD, so it's not the highest quality, but it's certainly very watchable, with a clear enough picture and sound.  Just don't expect a pristine print.  Honestly, I was expecting much worse, so I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality.  Until we get a mastering from Universal, this is an excellent stopgap.",1458345600,,468,4.578313253012048
