6567124,5,B00MARZSW6,"I recently purchased this Digitally Remastered Video.  It is excellent.  The package contains three (3) DVD, and it is the complete George Washington Mini-Series, both the 1984 and 1986 productions.  It includes the early life of George Washington, the Revolutionary War, and also FORGING OF A NATION.  So the entire mini-series is all contained in this one package.

PART ONE, which is on two discs, is the entire 1984 Series ends with the End of the Revolutionary War in 1783.  George Washington resigns his commission and the Continental Army is disbanded.  George & Martha Washington return to their home at Mt. Vernon, Virginia.  George Washington attends to his plantation in this phase of his retirement.

The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was the first constitution of the United States.  It was drafted by the Second Continental Congress from mid-1776 through late-1777, and ratification by all 13 states was completed in early 1781. Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.

Although in a way, the Congressional powers in Article 9 made the ""league of states as cohesive and strong as any similar sort of republican confederation in history, the chief problem with the new government under the Articles of Confederation was, in the words of George Washington, ""no money."" The Continental Congress could print money; but, by 1786, the currency was worthless. (A popular phrase of the times chimed that a useless object or person was .. not worth a Continental, referring to the Continental dollar.) Congress could borrow money, but couldn't pay it back. No state paid all their U.S. taxes; Georgia paid nothing, as did New Jersey in 1785. Some few paid an amount equal to interest on the national debt owed to their citizens, but no more. No interest was paid on debt owed foreign governments. By 1786, the United States would default on outstanding debts as their dates came due.  James Madison angrily questioned whether the Articles of Confederation was a binding compact or even a viable government. Congress was paralyzed. It could do nothing significant without nine states, and some legislation required all thirteen.  In 1789 a new Constitution was ratified with a strong central government, and George Washington was sworn in as the first President in May 1789.

THUS WASHINGTON WAS BASICALLY INVOLVED IN FARMING FROM 1783 UNTIL 1789, OR ABOUT 5 OR 6 YEARS.  PART TWO, OF THE MINI-SERIES WAS AIRED IN 1986, and begins when the Constitution was approved.  PART TWO was called, GEORGE WASHINGTON-FORGING OF A NATION, and it is the series that was aired in 1986.  I was surprised that Forging of a Nation was also included as Disc 3 in this package.  Disc 3 concludes when George Washington completes his second term of office and when he and Martha leave Philadelphia and return to Mount Vernon.

I am a student of history, and I find this mini-series to be historically accurate, for the most part.  There are many emotional parts in the videos, and the digital remastering was done very well.",1419984000,79,3296,5.125233644859813

The menus did not correlate, sometimes the you would watch several ""episodes"" at once, for several hours, other times it would stop.  Never knew where you were, had to just fast forward to manually find where you left off.  I don't know if this was just our set or if they were all made this way...no chapters or clear stopping points.  Frustrating.

Like I said, it's been engrained in mine for 30 years! I've been looking online forever for this, but until now I could only find poor copied VHS tapes. Don't hesitate on this one.

6567162,5,B00MARZSW6,Well done and very detailed. It gives an insight to the evolution of George Washington from loyal subject to Founding Father and GREAT Statesman! Some what long...but covers a lot of history. Although it is presented in a simplistic and often inaccurate way...it was a TV movie and producers often take..'Liberties'...(no pun intended) with history.

6567164,4,B00MARZSW6,"I grew up watching this series on TV; it seemed to always be on around the Fourth of July and so I would watch it at my Grandmother's house then. As far as I can tell, this is the complete mini-series, unedited. (I also used to own the VHS tapes, all 5 of them, and the DVD matches my memories of the 5 VHS tapes of the two series.) The series itself is a good biopic of the life of George Washington. Barry Bostwick is excellent as Washington and Patty Duke is wonderful in every scene she is in. (It's one of my favorite roles for Patty Duke.) The costumes are pretty good and my understanding is many of the scenes were filmed-on-location (or nearby.) At times I found some of the subplots (i.e. Hamilton's affair and Benedict Arnold's second wife/lover a bit melodramatic, but from what I have read, these affairs were the stuff of melodrama anyway. And personally I found Jaclyn Smith as Sally Fairfax a little over-the-top at times.)

My one issue with the DVD is: no subtitles. I wasn't really expecting them, but I had really been hoping there would be. I have a hearing impairment, so there is a lot I miss without subtitles so I wish they had taken the time to add subtitles. Also for being ""digitally remastered"" -- the picture isn't an worse than what I recall my original VHS tapes being when new, but it's no high-grade remaster/restoration that you'll see in famous films either.

If you already know the series, you probably won't be disappointed. Some might find the series a little slow at times, but I'm glad they took the time with these older mini-series and didn't try to squeeze it in 90 minutes or less. You really learn a lot about Washington's relationships with his generals , etc.",1487635200,,1708,4.506451612903226
6567165,5,B00MARZSW6,"great movie for Washington enthusiates. barry bostwick  was perfect for the part.  it got  very emotional at the end when he was walking away amidst cheering from the crowd that had gathered after he just turned over the government to john adams. at first I was alittle let down that the series didn't follow him  back to life at mt. Vernon. but the more I reflected on this , the more I liked how and where it ended leaving me hungering to read more about him.

6567179,5,B00MARZSW6,"I have been looking for this for years.  It is my hope that Amazon will make available on the same basis the sequel to this series, ""George Washington: Founding of the Republic."" (or something like that)

We watched this mini-series when it first came out, along with our two young daughters.  Those daughters have now given us grandchildren who will soon be ready to watch it with us as well.

It is probably the best single dramatic presentation that I have ever seen of the main story of the American Revolution and (if Amazon follows on with the sequel mini-series) the founding of the United States as a republic. Does it have flaws and omissions? Of course it does! It is the nature of such productions to distill the story to make it presentable. I have four library shelves (and now stored ebooks) on the history of the American Revolution and the Founding, One shelf is entirely collections of primary writings. Another is entirely made up of biographies of Washington.  If you want all aspects of his life and the movement that he came to embody, read.

But if you want an enjoyable, engaging, and reasonably accurate view of the man for whom the Presidency of the United States was specifically designed by the Founders -- and especially if you want it to come alive for young people -- this is an excellent way to start!",1476748800,3,1332,4.622881355932203

6567184,5,B00MARZSW6,"This is a repackaging of the out of print PBS mini-series. The original PBS was one of the best attempts at chronicling in (dramatic film fashion) the entire adult life of George Washington in one series. Washington's life, actions and accomplishments permanently impacted and greatly influenced this country and the entire world. The role of president of the United States really was created based on George Washington, the man. This DVD combines the 2 segments of the original PBS Broadcast; George Washington, the early years and Forging a nation.  If you ever have a chance to see the original PBS 2 part presentation, do so as well. But this is still an excellent quality, informative and engaging reprint/re-issue non-the less. Barry Bostwick does a very good job as Washington and Patty Duke puts in a very good performance as Martha. Youll recognize other familiar actors in the move as well. It has a good cast all around. The quality of the production, period settings, attire and locations are excellent too. Many scenes filmed at the actual historical locations. That adds to the realism. This is a interesting, informative and educational movie as well as entertainment. It's also a good movie to watch if you are not up on your early US history and/or want to see it dramatized on screen. Its also an entertaining and an excellent movie for people who like historical movies and those about true events or for those who just want to better understand why we are here. Good for adults and the family as well.",1474848000,3,1521,4.85
6567185,2,B00MARZSW6,"The history covered seems accurate but the George Washington in this series is nothing like the real George.  The only thing close to our first President is the height of the actor, and what is sad is George Washingtons faith.  Which his mother was responsible for teaching him the Bible from childhood, just like Abraham Lincoln's mother did.  Even Georges mother was not even close to the real mom he had.  The costumes are great but the depth of this story about George Washingtons life is shallow at best.",1474416000,,509,4.685393258426966

6567193,5,B00MARZSW6,"I just spent the last two days watching this series and even though I have read a lot about the Revolutionary War, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of it, both in it being really remastered and the excellent content. I especially enjoyed the episodes that covered the years of Washington's presidency. The relevance to today's world of the corruption and scams, and the newspapers who thought nothing of distorting the truth, let alone printing lies about Washington struck me as not that different from what we have still today in politics. Barry Bostwick  was excellent in the role of Washington, going from the enthusiasm and energy of a young man, to the maturity of an experienced general, to his humility when he realized the respect of his men and the devotion of Americans, to his anguish of finding corruption in his government and in men he loved and trusted. Bostwick brought Washington down from the canvases in the Capitol to portraying a  man that we can all relate to and admire. Supporting players were excellent. Patty Duke as Martha Washington was loving, warm and comforting. You could easily understand why Washington loved Martha and needed her in his life. And it was fun to see other men, such as Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Henry Knox, whom I had only read about, come to life. A last point is how well this series played on a 60 inch screen. I was not expecting much from a TV miniseries that was done so long ago. So another pleasant surprise was the beauty of the scenery, both country and town. If I were teaching American history, I would use this as the perfect introduction for young people into the realities of the founding of our country, the thinking of that time, the men and women who lived through it, the sacrifices they made and the importance of preserving what they have handed down to us.",1471564800,9,1868,4.709480122324159

I am half-way through it on my 60 inch, HD surround-sound system, and it is all that I can do to stop myself to go to bed so that I can resume watching it the next night. The script, the acting, the cinematography, the sound-track are amazing. Twenty-some hours on 3 disks for less than 15 dollars! I teach this stuff at the college level, and I can vouch for its general historical accuracy, with some reservations. There are cinematic values requiring omissions, dramatics effects, etc. that justify something less than an accurate documentary.

6567202,5,B00MARZSW6,"Being a longtime student of US History, I liked the reverence with which the Founding Fathers were depicted while being contextually fair about their short comings.  No revisionist slamming of them using Sail Alinsky tactics.  Also a truly wonderful cast of first rate actors.  I will forever see Patty Duke as the quintessential Martha Washington; her signature role if you will.  The same for Barry Bostwick.  And perhaps as importantly, much if movie filmed where it all actually happened:  Williamsburg, Yorktown, Mount Vernon, Boston, Philadelphia, including many historic homes and buildings.  And the wardrobes outstanding.  Truly a warm, noble effort exceeding even the John Adams movie of 2008.  A must for any family to jump start their understanding of our proud history not being taught in schools.  And a catalyst for asking why?  Be a proud American again.

6567215,5,B00MARZSW6,"Recently I purchased the George Washington series on DVD.  Way back in the early 1980s I watched the series on television and loved it.  I eventually recorded it on VHS tape and have played it many times over the years.  (The tapes are getting very old and I have been concerned about them giving out.  I still play VHS tapes and some are very old.  Once in a while one breaks and is lost to me because no DVD exists for them.  So I play them cautiously.)

I searched for the George Washington mini-series on DVD over the years but it was never available to my great disappointment.  Recently, while looking for historical DVDs I found that this series has finally been released on a DVD.  It contains both the series of Washington during the American Revolution and the subsequent series as President that came out a year after the original.

The DVD is great and contains everything you might remember from the television mini-series.

However, I got one very big surprise!  The DVD contains loads of scenes that were a part of the original television mini-series BUT NEVER MADE IT TO TELEVISION.  For a variety of reasons they were cut out of the series and I never saw them.  Many of these cut out parts explain some of the gaps that the mini-series had on TV.  I am absolutely delighted with seeing them now.

So, if you remembered and liked the George Washington mini-series staring Barry Bostwick from the 1980s and would like to get it again for your very own, I overwhelmingly recommend this DVD set!  It is great!",1455235200,10,1523,4.560885608856089

The acting is top class and it's one of those tv series that's hard to stop watching. As a result I binged and viewed the whole series in two nights.

The cast is magnificent and I loved the music although sadly they never released the soundtrack for it which was an exceptionally stupid move. I was surprised by Bostwick who did a truly magnificent job of showing Washington from a green, young man to the war weary general at the end of the Revolution, to returning to Mount Vernon after his Presidency. Patty Duke was a wonderfully warm Martha Washington and Jaclyn Smith as his first love, Sally Fairfax were perfectly cast. I bought another set for my mom who also loves the series. Well worth it to me, even if the price had been higher.",1443744000,2,742,4.384057971014493
6567227,5,B00MARZSW6,"I have long loved colonial American history and I remember watching this series when it originally aired when I was in elementary and junior high. I loved it so much I remember reading Flexner's book, upon which this series is based, and writing a book report on it in 8th grade. I was completely moved then and having viewed it last week for the first time since the late 80's (VHS finally gave out about that time) I can whole heartedly say it is just as beautiful, wonderful and of extremely high quality as it was so many year ago,

I have been waiting for about 20 years for this to come to DVD! I can't thank TGG DIrect and Amazon for working together with MGM to get this finally put on DVD! It truly has been digitally remastered to a stunning degree and it IS finally the complete series (Part I ""George Washington"" on two discs and Part II ""George Washington:Forging of a Nation"" on one disc). The images are crisp and clear, the sound is great, the colors are truly vibrant and the complete quality is excellent. Amazingly it doesn't seem dated which is a testament to the quality and timelessness of the production. I fully agree that Barry Bostwick and Patty Duke were made for these monumental rolls and they handle them with masterful skill. The film series is truly beautiful, moving, heart wrenching, exciting, tender and full of spirit. The producers effort to not only follow Flexner's ground breaking and award winning historical masterpiece book extremely close but to also to include, and actually listen to, him in so many aspects of the production has made this series is a wonderful survey of Washington's life, both personal and professional, as well as a powerful comprehensive dramatization of the blood, sweat, tears and whole hearted sacrifice it took to make this nation breathe.

It is among my most prized possession in my DVD collection, so much so that I am buying a back up copy as soon as I finish this review in case anything should happen to the original.. THANK YOU TGG DIRECT, AMAZON & MGM! Keep up the great work!",1441152000,19,2055,4.627397260273972

6567229,5,B00MARZSW6,"Just watched this series for the first time and was so excited to discover a fairly accurate representation of George Washington based on memoirs and documentation of the era.  I would have liked the Barbados episode involving Lawrence Washington included in the script as that was a pivotal moment when Washington was inoculated against smallpox,  learned a great deal about running his plantation, and observed British military procedures; all of which helped prepare him for his future role as General in the Revolutionary war.  It would have been interesting to see Martha inoculate her family, as well, as she was so important to the stabilized  atmosphere that allowed George the freedom to give so much of himself and his time to this nation.  Although the ending, in the concluding episode, with the retiring and triumphant General leaving his presidential position was satisfying, an ending with Nellie's wedding at Mount Vernon,  as that is where we may still go to savor the memory of our first president, and feed our souls with that environment that inspired the founding of the United States of America, would have been heart-warming.  Aside from those transforming moments in time that could have been captured, this is an uplifting and educational series for the entire family, and ours will probably grab a bbq and watermelon and enjoy these moments on video each Fourth of July, like forever.",1439856000,14,1410,5.077922077922078

6567238,2,B00MARZSW6,"I have always wanted this movie.  I love these type of mini-series, especially about history.  I didn't get a chance to watch this when it originally aired, so that's why I thought I'd order it when I saw it on here.  Alot of the reviews on the other copy that was listed here were not that good.  Some complained about the quality, and some complained that parts were cut out.  I saw this copy and it seemed that people were satisfied, so I thought I would take a chance.  I should have heeded the warning.  I tried playing this in my DVD player and it would not play.  It seems to be like a DVD-R type and those will not play in all players.  I am thoroughly disappointed with this, not only in the quality, but now I'm not going to be able to see it at all.  I don't know who thought it would be such a great idea to 'fast produce' copies like this (TGG Direct), but it sure is lousy.  Is there any way that an original from Universal Studios can be made?  It's really a shame as this appears to have been a good miniseries.  I am not happy with TGG Direct and whomever else is responsible.

6567248,4,B00MARZSW6,"George Washington (GW) and George Washington II: The Forging of a Nation, 1984 and 1986 TV miniseries, based on James Thomas Flexners award winning biography, are excellent in bringing Washington and his times to life. Barry Bostwick seems born to have portrayed Washington, from his youthful exuberance and struggles, social and political development, loves and tragedies, war endeavors, and through his aging into an ultimately wise man, with a genuineness that is engaging. And, considering Bostwick is in nearly every scene of GW, it has proved an impressive and enduring performance.

Patty Duke also seems perfectly cast as Martha Washington. Others in the vast casts fulfill their roles to varying degrees of satisfaction and historical accuracy. Many of the brief roles are excellently performed, James Mason as General Braddock for one. Jaclyn Smith as Sally Fairfax comes off better in GW than in Flexners biography (where shes a self-promoting, social climbing, selfish tease). Neither of the Alexander Hamiltons (Robert Schenkkan, Richard Bekins) strike me quite right as Washingtons brassy, easily slighted protge, but they don't distract from the storytelling.

The battle sequences in GW are a mixed bag. Theyre good for the mid-80s when the series was made, but only the ones from the French and Indian War and the Battle of Monmouth hold up well. That said, there are many scenes from both series that I have remembered from the time I first saw them in the 80s, the one of the Neuburgh, NY, meeting where Washington confronts his officers to prevent them from marching on Philadelphia to take over the government, is one in particular.

In seeing these productions again, I was impressed at how well, overall, they present valuable insights into a leader whose qualities are desperately needed in our world today. If only leaders here and abroad would study Washington anew, particularly his understanding of power  its use, not using it, and surrender of it  they and we might learn what it really takes to bring about lasting and peaceful change.",1428796800,19,2066,5.155223880597015
