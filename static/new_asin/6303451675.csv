7847500,5,6303451675,Great musical. A sequel to You're a Good Man Charlie Brown. I was so glad to find this because Warner hasn't released this on DVD in the states so I had to get it from the UK. It's PAL format but I just copied it to my computer and used a program to change settings to make it NTSC then burned it to a new disc and it plays just great. Only downside is no captions or subtitles. But the music was awesome.,1404432000,,405,3.891566265060241

7847504,5,6303451675,"This video is the animated special adapted from the play of the same title.  It has great songs, a good cast, and of course, Snoopy talking as a bonus.  It's the greatest musical ever since ""You're a Good Man,  Charlie Brown"".",930441600,6,226,4.463414634146342
7847505,2,6303451675,"I love Snoopy and the whole Peanuts gang, yet I couldn't love this video.  The beauty of Snoopy's character is that he doesn't need to have a voice for the audience to know what he is thinking.  Snoopy's mannerisms say it  all.  It was as big of a mistake as having the teacher speak in actual  words when Peppermint Patty was learning to ice skate.",925948800,,349,4.3076923076923075
7847506,5,6303451675,"""Snoopy: The Musical"" is probably the best Peanuts special since the ""Great Pumpkin."" The songs are creative, fun, and thought provoking at times. The big shock of this video is the fact that Snoopy has  inner vocal monologue. One of the songs, ""Believe in You"", was  used in the special that honored Jim Henson just after his death.",913248000,3,333,4.724137931034483
