7936756,1,B00005B6LW,I thought I was ordering something else an early show with Charlie Hunnam on the WB network. Instead I got a bunch of naked colledge guys acting very poorly. I have since discarded the DVD no fault of yours my oops!!!,1397260800,,217,4.317073170731708
7936757,1,B00005B6LW,"Misleading. This product came up when I search for something else with the same title.

The actual product that I want to purchase has same title, and when I search by actor's name this product came up. Bought it without reading the full description (my bad) but upon received, realizing that this is totally not what I wanted.

Still wonder why this product came up when I search an actor name when the name is not even listed in the product detail.

7936759,1,B00005B6LW,"This looks like it will be 9 young men having some fun in their own ways, but only 3 pairs of 2 only simulate love/sex/the dirty deed. Of these 3 pairs, only 1 pair seems to even be semi-aroused from their session of passionate kissing (LOTS of kissing, the rest is simulation). The camera tends to jitter alot, there is NO plot (if this was REAL smut, that would be OK), these kids just seem to be lead thru a few scenes of driving, getting to the B&B, and having lunch - the first B is only used for kidplay in the filler footage, there are 3 scenes of simulated lovemaking, and the 2nd B seems to be a feast of Subway sandwiches, which serves no purpose but to fill time so you won't think you wasted your money on what is really only a 30 minute movie with the rest as filler. Some cuties, and gorgeous bodies, BUT - don't buy this unless you are accustomed to disapointment (as I am). The only ""kid"" I wanted to look at was only shown in a 3 minute vignette in which his buddies pulled off his pants - he covered himself with his hands immediately - and they asked him to ""show us your world"". Fade to next unreal scene. Cute kids, poor script (was there one?), lame action. Except for the full frontal nudity, this deserves a G rating.",1024704000,13,1241,4.196652719665272
