1. Axls' voice. Axl strained his vocals so bad to sing in that trade-mark parrot-like screech of his that it was starting to get to him during the UYI tour. Some of the shows were even canceled because of voice problems. Some time after the tour Rose actually developed nodules on his vocal chords that had to be surgically removed. Let's face it, the man needed a break and used his disappearance from the spotlight as time for his vocal chords to heal. Granted Rose's voice is still awful today, but that is now due to old age. Basically the ""good"" singing Axl was like a bightly burning flame whose lifespan was very short.

2. Steven Adler getting the boot. Adler getting kicked out was a subtle change that started taking the band in the wrong direction. Adler's drumming kept the band's sound grounded in jazz/blues roots of rock n' roll. When Matt Sorum was brought in the bands sound began going in a more ""pop"" direction. The easiest example of this is listening to the original Don't Cry demo w/Adler on the drums, and then listening to the studio version with Sorum. Most of the other instruments play the same, but Adler's drumming in the original demo gives the song a much more blues based feel. Sorum's sound on the studio version is very poppy and mainstream. The drums alone totally change the feel of the song. This new ""pop"" direction that the band started going in was the beginning path to what got them to where they are now musically, with the weird techno crap that Axl plays now.

3. Axl's favorite type of music is weird techno crap. There is the story of Axl, back in the 90s, hearing NIN for the first time and being totally blown away by it, and absolutely loving it. After hearing NIN Axl approached the rest of the band with the music and asked if they wanted to experiment with type of music. The band obviously said no, but this was only foreshadowing of what has become of the band musically. That is a shame for Axl to be talented in rock, but to like alternative-techno crap more.

4. Izzy Stradlin quitting. Most people would say that the indispensable members of GNR are Axl and Slash, but that is wrong. There were actually 3 indispensable members of the band: Axl, Slash, and Izzy. While Axl and Slash were the ""voices"" of GNR, Izzy was the brain and backbone of the band. Those great guitar solos: Slash. Those great guitar riffs that provided the framework for Slash to work from: Izzy. Also, while Axl was the main song writer in the band, Izzy was a very close second in the lyric department. Ever noticed that after Izzy left the traditional GNR line-up never recorded another original song? Axl knew the band was toast when Stradlin left. That's why he constantly razzed on Izzy during the UYI tour after Izzy left.
Also, the other big thing that Izzy contributed to the band that is rarely talked about was being a buffer between the rest of the band and Axl. Axl and Izzy were childhood friends and Izzy could talk to Axl more openly than the other band members. With Izzy gone the line of communication started to deteriorate.

5. Axl having Slash and Duff sign legal documents giving Axl sole ownership of th eGNR name. He did this right before a show in Europe during the UYI Tour, surprising Slash and Duff moments before the show, a total jerk move. Axl's lawyer actually presented the papers to Slash and Duff and made threats that Axl would not perform that night unless they signed the paperwork. This basically put the nail in the coffin of the old GNR line up, and allowed Axl to transform the band into the garbage that it is today.",1446336000,2,3683,4.515742128935532
