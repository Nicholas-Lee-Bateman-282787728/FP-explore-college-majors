7911937,2,B00000JDIP,"In essence 'Waco: Decision to Die' is an indictment against unconventional religious groups, termed ""cults"" by the film. At the beginning Peter Jennings shows us a bit about life in Mt. Carmel, mostly in footage  from the Australian show 'A Current Affair.'  The entire segment is  actually attempting to drive home the point that David Koresh was a  powerful mind controlling madman and his flock a group of sheep, totally  hypnotized by Koresh.  Later in the show Jennings turns to a panel of cult  ""experts"" to present another one-sided view of the events at Waco  and of  ""cults"" in general.
As is often the case with such  panels the tone is grave but admirably unhysterical, as the  ""experts"" contemplate the villainy of cults and how it's the  governments job to rid us of this immanent danger.  This of course would be  a direct attack on religious liberty.  This attack is especially scary  precisely because it is presented so skillfully, sensibly, and with the  pretense of being scientific.  In reality the vast majority of  unconventional religious groups, though odd, are harmless and shows like  this tend to paint them all as cults, and intrinsically the same.  I find  this bothersome.
In short, while this film almost perfectly  demonstrates just how unbalanced the media coverage of Waco was, and it  shows just how close we actually can come to religious intolerance, it is  really not useful in understanding the events at Waco.  If you want a film  that covers Waco without bias I suggest the film 'Attack At Waco.'  If you  want a film that humanizes the Davidians and explains Waco at greater  length (although with an anti government bias) I suggest 'Waco: Rules of  Engagement.'  'Waco: Decision to Die' however, I cannot recommend.",957312000,2,1758,4.914383561643835
