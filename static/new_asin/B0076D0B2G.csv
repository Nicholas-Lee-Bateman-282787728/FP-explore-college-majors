Informative, frightening, and brutally honest, this film shows the risks we'd all like to think don't exist when taking modern ""wonder drugs"" aka antibiotics.  If you have children--you need to see this.  If you ever been prescribed antibiotics--you'll want to see this.  If you've ever travelled abroad like I have, and been told to use it in case of emergency...you'll be looking for other alternatives.
Don't miss this documentary.",1328745600,12,518,5.130952380952381
5057477,5,B0076D0B2G,"A well done, informational documentary about a group of drugs we will all likely come in contact with at some time in our lives.  Well worth purchasing, especially considering the potential cost of taking Cipro or Levaquin.  I think better to know what you're up against now, than find out too late.  (certainly helped keep me 'healthier' with my visit to the hospital).

5057479,5,B0076D0B2G,"This is a wonderful and frightening film - wonderful because it gets the word out about the very real dangers of fluoroquinolone antibiotics and frightening because of the denial of these problems in the medical community.  All antibiotics save thousands of lives . . . fluoroquinolones also destroy thousands of lives.  I was a healthcare provider at one of the top ranked teaching hospitals/healthcare systems in the US.  I was prescribed cipro for a hospital acquired infection despite my repeated protests that I did not want a drug from this class.  The physician arrogantly and ignorantly refused to take my reservations seriously when, in truth, he could have prescribed another antibiotic.  Five days of Cipro turned me from a healthy, extremely athletic 48 year old to not being able to work with my hands, run, hike or do anything remotely physically vigorous.  The adverse effects of this drug are far worse than I could ever have imagined.  I aged 30 years in one week and almost two years later am still engaged in a battle to regain what I can of what this drug has taken from me.  The one star reviews on this page are representative of the widespread denial in the medical community about iatrogenic (caused by treatment) conditions.  It also speaks to the power of marketing and downplaying negative consequences of drugs by big Pharma.  This film isn't about scaring people - it's about presenting the other side of the story about these drugs - a story that you will not hear from big Pharma or the FDA.  Presenting the truth is not fear mongering - denying the truth is something much worse.",1331251200,16,1611,4.800724637681159
5057480,5,B0076D0B2G,"I was given one intravenous dose of Levaquin, in July,2010.  My life has not been the same since.  Even as a healthcare provider myself, I felt there was no where to turn in the medical community. The effects were devastating, affecting my connective tissue, and my central and peripheral nervous systems.  This video helped me realize I was not alone, and since then, I have come in contact with almost 2000 other victims of Fluoroquinolone Toxicity through online support groups.  This video is the truth!  I now have a neuro-muscular disorder and severe peripheral neuropathy from a dose that I did not even need. I was perfectly healthy prior to that one dose, and was very active physically.  These medications were intended as a ""last resort""  for serious infections.  They were not intended to be given out for simple infections, or in my situation, ""just in case"".  Educate yourself about these antibiotics!!",1331251200,8,916,4.973684210526316

The FQ victim in my family has suffered severe reactions to and physical damage from these drugs since the year 2000.

Information about the devastating effects of these drugs have been withheld from the American public by the drug companies and their lackeys in the FDA because of pure greed.

5057483,5,B0076D0B2G,"GET THIS DOCUMENTARY - save your life, save a friend, save your family. Lots of good antibiotics out there, these just aren't the good ones! GREAT GREAT DOCUMENTARY - SO WELL DONE! This movie saved my sanity by affirming everything that I already knew was happening to me but couldn't explain. August 23, 2011. The day my life changed forever because I took Levaquin for a simple sinus infection.  I only made it 5 days on the prescription before my whole body started shutting down, couldn't walk, ended up in wheelchair, and by the Grace of God, not Dr's, I walk with no wheelchair, walking boots or crutches anymore, but walk with pain and move with pain every single day, but sad to say, I'm one of the ""lucky"" ones. I'm 40 years old and 6 months before my 40th birthday, Levaquin destroyed my health. I can't work and was very successful. I can't think straight and have brain fog all of the time. I spend much of my days on the couch or in bed from pain. 6 1/2 months later and every day  is a struggle. That's great that these drugs can save lives, that need saving. Sure, there's a risk, but if you're dying, you can afford to take a risk. I WASN'T dying - I had a sinus infection and now I'm disabled and Dr's have absolutely no treatment for this devastation. For those that wrote poor reviews, take Levaquin, take lots and lots and lots of Levaquin if you think it's so outrageous. On the other hand, I wouldn't wish this torture on anyone, not even my enemy.
Now if only I had seen this before August 23, 2011...

5057484,5,B0076D0B2G,"This movie tells the truth!!!

In the fall of 2007 I was given Levaquin. No one discussed the many possible side effects with me. I immediately began to feel sick but no one took me seriously. In the course of the next few months I endured a horrible series of medical problems and yet no one caring for me was able to figure out what was going on despite the fact that nearly all these terrible 'symptoms' are listed in the literature about Levaquin. I was dizzy, nauseous, tired and confused. I lost control of my bladder and had horrific gas and diarrhea. My whole body hurt. I had blood clots. I had ruptured tendons and unexplained cartilage damage. My blood pressure went through the ceiling. My prostate bloated up. I had insomnia. I had pulmonary edema. My stomach hurt and I had terrible heartburn. I had a hematoma and huge varicose veins erupted on my leg. I had rashes all over, and mysterious bruises, and my wounds wouldn't heal. My skin felt like bugs were crawling around underneath it. I had tingling sensations in my back that went all over my body. I had unprompted sharp pains all over that appeared and disappeared. My joints hurt and they began popping loudly. I had ringing in my ears. I had wild crazy panic attacks. I couldn't understand what I was reading, or make sense of signs, or follow a TV show, or even tell time. My vision deteriorated rapidly. My blood oxygen levels were low.  I was extremely depressed and thought about suicide constantly. It's a wonder I didn't kill myself and honestly every day is still a battle not to do so.

As of March 2012, it's been four and a half years since I was floxed (that's the informal term for victims of fluoroquinolone toxicity) and I am still a mess. Fortunately, things aren't as bad as they were but my discs are degenerating rapidly so I am unable to work. Unfortunately as some things heal others continue to deteriorate.

Fluoroquinolones were designed to be a last resort antibiotic and yet they are being prescribed for sinus and urinary infections. The manufacturers of these drugs admit that all these side effects happen but they claim that only 0.7% of the population will experience the worst of them, and yet if you Google these drugs page after page after page will come up with support groups and facebook pages and stories of misery just like mine and just like those in this movie; the similarities between people's stories are striking. Considering that many millions of prescriptions for these drugs are written each year, this small percentage amounts to tens of thousands of people who are horribly sickened by this drug annually. The problem is that the onset of problems is often delayed by months or even years so a huge percentage of the victims have no idea what happened to them. They are then misdiagnosed. The other problem is that most people who get symptoms get most or all of them. The problems are systemic and they are permanent. There is very little research being done in regards to this problem because Big Pharma is making obscene profits selling this crap. They are in complete denial that these problems even exist and the drug representatives actively mislead doctors into believing these drugs are safe. In fact I wouldn't be surprised to see their agents on this site giving this movie bad reviews in hopes that the truth stays buried for a little longer. The mass marketing of fluoroquinolones is a crime against humanity and this film helps shed some light on this fact.

5057486,5,B0076D0B2G,"The truth about this class of drugs is that they are way to strong for a simple infection or no infection at all.  Everyone should watch this film if they are prescribed a fluoroquinolone, I wish I had!  Unless your life is in danger ask your Dr. for a different antibiotic, these are only meant to be used as a LAST RESORT.  Be prepared for the medical establishment to act like they don't know what you're talking about because most of them really don't!  I am still having major problems 7 months after taking Cipro and my Dr. finally admitted that it ""probably"" caused me to have severe anxiety and a terrible IBS flare and I ""probably"" never needed it in the first place!",1331251200,8,676,4.42741935483871
5057487,5,B0076D0B2G,"I will never forget the date of 3-1-10. That's the day I took a week long course of Cipro and went from being a very athletic and healthy 42 year old professional to a disabled cripple in one short week. That's how devastating the side effects from these drugs are. Two years have passed since then and I am still in chronic pain with major nerve, tendon and cartilage damage throughout my body. This film does a great job of showing how many people are affected by this class of antibiotics and why the US regulatory system has thus far failed to properly regulate these drugs. It interviews victims, doctors, pharmacists and lawyers to help you make an informed decision on your own health. I wish I'd seen this film before it was too late for me.",1331251200,16,749,4.474452554744525

The July 2016 FDA report said ""an FDA safety review found that both oral and injectable fluroquinolones are associated with disabling side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system. These side effects can occur hours to weeks after exposure to fluoroquinolones and may potentially be permanent.""
It's great there is a documentary out there to alert people, besides the huge black box warning on the drug itself.  If your doctor gives you this for anthrax or plague its perhaps justified.  For anything else, please consider the medical reports, FDA reports and evidence such as this documentary!",1472947200,2,748,5.384615384615385

Not only was it informative, but it validates how so many of us feel after taking a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and how hard it is to get people to understand that these are not just rare side effects, they are life changing, debilitating poison and should not be on the market.  The doctors are not well informed or have too big of an ego to listen to what patient is telling them while and after taking.  Instead of telling you that these ruined my life, which they have for the last couple of years, I am trying to be positive that some good will come out of it and at some point I will feel as close to the person I was before taking as possible.

I am very suseptable to advere reactions to Pharmaceuticals, to the point of reacting to someone in the same household who is taking a Phramaceutical. Last year my husband was treated with Cipro for a urinary infection on top of an enlarged Prostate. Fortunately, he seems to escaped unscathed; I, on the other hand, suffered with a yeast infection, muscle aches and pains and severe headaches and depression. This because I was in close confines with him. Recently. our daughter, suffered through a severe case of Ramsey-Hunt. One of the Pharmas she was put on was Cipro. We all live in the same household, now. She has suffered with memory fog, intense headaches, eczema, diarrhea, muscle and joint pain, anxiety and vomiting. Now that she has been off the drug for the past couple of weeks, these symptoms are beginning to pass. She has been detoxing, which I'm sure has helped. On my part; I again suffered reactions just by being in constant close proximity to someone on this drug, with headache, muscle and joint pain, diarrhea, anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.",1414800000,,1123,4.91578947368421
