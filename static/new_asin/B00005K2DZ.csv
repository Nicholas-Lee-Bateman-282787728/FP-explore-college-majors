8180545,5,B00005K2DZ,"Narrated by Dame Margot, this is a romantic look at her life--the way she wanted it to be seen.  Many clips from her various performances, bits of interviews, newsreel footage, all very well put together.  It is most interesting to see after reading the excellent biography by Meredith Daneman.",1461196800,2,294,4.979591836734694

8180548,5,B00005K2DZ,"Margot Fonteyn was an exquisite ballet dancer. She refused to have any part in a television program about her life but agreed to do this in 1989. Two years later she died from cancer

She speaks and reminisces from her home in Panama. This is her view of her life looking back at the beginning of her dance lessons through her retirement to the cattle ranch in Panama. She narrates photos. There are some others who tell of their part in her life, instructors, and partners including Nureyev. Included are short scenes of her performances where one can see how perfect she was.
The film does not do a good job of identifying all who speak. There are no closed captions, only scene selections. The running time is 88 minutes",1405728000,8,723,4.561538461538461
8180549,4,B00005K2DZ,"I am a major fan of Margot Fonteyn. She was a beautiful, talented, and world famous British ballerina, who danced primarily in the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70,s with the Royal Ballet of London. She retired in 1979 at the age of 60! On top of that and by all accounts, she was a very nice and down to earth person. However, Margot was notorious for putting an antiseptic spin in her private life, and since she was obviously in control of this project, in which she narrates the story, she was in full coyly antiseptic form! This is especially true when she is talking about her husband( a complete rake, injured or not) and her favorite partner, Rudolf Nureyev. This does not mean that the story is not enjoyable as there are many clips of her dancing and those are thoroughly enchanting.",1403395200,2,784,4.489510489510489

8180551,5,B00005K2DZ,I have been a fan of Margot Fonteyn since I was a child years ago.  I enjoy reading or viewing anything about her life.  She was a great ballerina.,1384819200,2,147,4.0344827586206895
