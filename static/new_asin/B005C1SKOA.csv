8464716,5,B005C1SKOA,"This is my kids' favorite movie! It panders exactly to my belief system, which is great because kids shouldn't be taught how to think critically. It taught him valuable life skills such as not questioning anything the bible tells you. The Lord is just and although we may not know his intentions, we must follow them blindly. Your kids are never too young to be indoctrinated into a belief system that's impossible to shake, and this ensures that they'll pay their tithing responsibly for life! I'm so proud of the lessons that my son has learned from this movie. This movie finally taught my son that non-believers (including his JERK of a father) are destined to burn in heck forever.
If you want to feel fuzzy inside and be shown that all of your bizarre beliefs are true, look no further than this 1 hour gem of a movie. Your atheist friends are GUARANTEED to be converted after just a single viewing. AMAZING.",1524700800,,914,4.613496932515337
