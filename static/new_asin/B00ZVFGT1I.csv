7295455,5,B00ZVFGT1I,"What a great DVD! I can't stress enough how much I love this DVD! After watching the DVD I was out shooting and producing some wonderful images without having the camera on auto! Michael teaches in a simple, easy to understand way that got me quickly shooting. The DVD goes beyond the basic functions of the camera and also into the fundamentals of photography. I would recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn how to use their camera and get a jump start on learning about how to take pictures.",1435104000,8,500,4.5054945054945055

8721009,5,B00ZVFGT1I,"I bought my wife a new computer, it's called a Nikon D7200. We wanted to get off of auto everything but we needed help doing it. I Googled the subject and soon found out that everyone has their own opinion on what settings to use and what lenses to buy and one photographer made a youtube video talking down about another photographer,.....give me a break. Anyway, I found this and read the reviews and decided to buy it. I have just finished the entire video and have decided that this was and is absolutely perfect for my wife and I. Michael has a nice easy way about him and it looks like he has put an awful lot of time and effort into making this instructional video. Not only does he teach you about the camera and how to use it but he also gives really go insights on photography itself. I liked it so much that I/we have now joined his Miachaelthemaven forum which seems to have really nice down to earth people on it as well. If you bought this camera, you should absolutely buy this dvd.",1442361600,10,997,4.28042328042328
