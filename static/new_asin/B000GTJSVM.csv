2618303,5,B000GTJSVM,"Fun and challenging workout.  Jari Love is motivating and not too chatty.  The music is good and there is just enough variety in the workout so one doesn't become bored.  If a workout is what you want, a workout is what you're going to get.  It's a good buy for the fun and the money.",1169078400,3,284,4.109090909090909
2618304,5,B000GTJSVM,"This is a great workout!  It is about 60 minutes long and alternates short cardio burst segments with weight lifting segments.  The cardio segments are very short timewise, but very intense.  I have really enjoyed this workout and Jari Love is a good instructor.  Definitely burns the calories!",1168819200,4,294,5.0625
2618305,5,B000GTJSVM,"This dvd kicks butt. With some instructors it seems like they just repackage their routine and put out it out on another dvd. I have all of Jari's workouts and  use all of them religiously and on a regular basis and I know they work, and each one is different. She has such a direct motivational approach. Her dvd's do seem to be targeted more towards people who already have a good understanding of excersising regularly but there's nothing to keep a beginner from being able to do this workout, just start out easy, it's up to the exerciser to push theirselves to their own workout level doing Jari's exercises, which makes it a great workout for all levels. This dvd mixes cardio and weight training using compound exercises. There are times I feel like I'm not going to make it through and I consider myself an advanced exerciser. But I love a workout that really challenges me physically and when I've finished I know I have taken another step toward my personal fitness goal.",1168473600,3,981,4.605714285714286
2618306,5,B000GTJSVM,"As the owner of all of Jari Love's dvd's, this newest edition, Get Ripped 1000, is the BEST by far. As someone who has made working out a part of my daily life, I can attest to the quality and proven results of not only Get Ripped 1000, but all of Love's dvd's.  Having lost a great deal of weight and being a gym regular, Jari Love's dvd's are a breath of fresh air-albeit mentally and physically challenging.  Her excellent cueing, great music, motivational words and the compound excersises are hepling me bust thru another plateau and taking my fitness level to a whole other realm.  She has succeeded in not only challenging this dedicated workout maven, but she has also won me over as a dedicated fan of her work. I needed a big challenge as I was getting bored and my body was plateauing...Jari Love helped me over this hump and I am in the best shape of my life.  I have great cardio endurance & I lift regularly, but Jari woke up my body & my mind and I am amzed at the results.  I recommend ALL of her dvd'd for men, women, teens, seniors.....Anyone who is looking for the best in this industry must check out Jari Love.  She is up there with the best of the best!",1167523200,9,1175,4.27027027027027
2618307,5,B000GTJSVM,"This is a gerat workout when you can't get to the gym.  It's very difficult to find advanced worjouts that actually challenege me, but this does the job.  The workout covers all muscle groups and throws some cardio in there.  The best thing about this workout is that each segment is short (but challenging).  Just when you think you can't take anymore and want to stop, the segment is over.  IT quickly moves on to the next thing, so your heartrate stays up.

Another great thing is that she does an excellent job of showing you modifications. I don't have a step at home, but that's no problem- at least one person of the 4 doesn't use a step (for each segment), so you can see how to modify it.

I would definitley reccommend this one to anyone who is serious about getting in shape.",1167350400,6,786,4.379310344827586
2618308,5,B000GTJSVM,"Jari Love's Get Ripped program is phenominal. This newest DVD, Get Ripped! 1000 is incredible. The workout is challenging, but gets results. Jari is motivating without being perky or annoying and one can tell that she beleives in what she is doind.

THe atmosphere is calm and high energy at the same time. There are three other participants in the workout and the modifications are clear and effective.

Jari gives some of the best directions ever and I thouroughly enjoy enjoy this extreme workout!",1166572800,2,500,4.940476190476191
2618309,3,B000GTJSVM,"This is my fourth RIPPED DVD and I was somewhat disappointed. It just didn't work for me compared to the previous ones, especially on muscle exertion and cardio.  It as a good idea to have the alternating of cardio on the step and strength training & high reps, though.",1164585600,5,269,4.489795918367347
2618310,5,B000GTJSVM,"I have all of Jari's workouts and couldn't wait for this one to show up.  This is different and more advanced then her 3 previous workouts.  In this workout you will alternate weight lifting with cardio on the step (there is also a version that includes beginner moves for those just starting out)You have 15 segments with this workout that are broke down with a 3 1/2 minute of weight training followed by a 90 second cardio section.  Might sound easy but you are using the step to increase your heart rate, which you do.  The reason it's called the 1000 is for a more advanced individual you can burn up to a 1000 calories in this one hour workout.  The weightlifting is standard get ripped sections and you are doing high reps to get the sleek toned muscle that burns major calories and tones the entire body.  There are no wasted moves on this workout.  The speed is a bit fast so I would suggest watching this one once through to get the moves and see the changes.  I rank this the best workout I own at this point.  Jari only suggests doing this one two to three times a week because it's intense and she's not kidding.  You will see results, I've only been doing this workout 3 weeks and have amazing results at this point.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great workout that has everything to get you in the best shape of your life.",1164240000,13,1355,4.337301587301587
2618311,5,B000GTJSVM,"I have two other dvds of Jari and because they were so good, I couldn't wait to get a copy of this.  It's also fantastic and tough and effective and will have you burning fat and calories like crazy.

It's a great interval workout using step and then weights.  You alternate tough repetition body sculpting moves with step for your cardio (it's not too dancy but very challenging).  This makes it more effective for fitness training and weight loss.  There is one part where you do (or try hard to do) 70 push ups in a row.  I can't do it, but this dvd gives you something to work for and try to improve on.  If you aren't a good stepper then don't worry.  There is no choreography to speak of; it's just a focus on one move and you repeat that for the complete interval to really get your heart rate up.

Don't think this is for the faint of heart.  You will need to be somewhat fit to make it through here.  If you aren't - then you may get discouraged.  If you are starting out, this is an excellent dvd to have on hand for when you get closer to your fitness goals.  She's a great instructor who doesn't mess around and will push you to your limits.  I really like the challenge.",1161302400,68,1183,4.176991150442478
2618312,2,B000GTJSVM,"Disappointing. I bought it for it's ""1000 calorie burn"" claim.  I followed the DVD to the letter (weights and all) and I would say you can only burn 1000 calories if you weigh more than 150lbs. At 110lbs I don't think I expended more than 400 (which is still a lot). My heart rate wasn't nearly as elevated as I expected during the cardio intervals and I was expecting to be more sweaty than I was at the end.",1453680000,,409,4.177215189873418
2618313,2,B000GTJSVM,"I've never done a Jari Love workout so I thought I'd give this a try.  I typically do Cathe or Beachbody workouts 5 days per week so I'm a fairly advanced exerciser.  This is not a 1000 calorie workout!  I think this is more of an intermediate workout.  I would not consider it advanced, like I would Insanity.  To burn 1000 calories in an hour, you'd have to be doing some super intense cardio, and even then, it would be very difficult to burn 1000 calories per hour.  There are certainly better circuit workouts out there than this one.  The cardio sessions in between the weight portions were extremely short and some of them were just not very safe.  The jumping jacks on and off the step (at the pace she was going) can be a good way to roll the ankle.....and for what?  There's lots of cardio exercises that don't beg for an injury and are actually interesting, but you won't find those here.  The workout just didn't flow well.  I ended up having to place the step somewhat diagonally towards my TV, because they kept shifting the camera angle to the front and side of the step, which made it hard to watch the TV while working out.  That is just bad producing... They should have kept the step in it's starting position and had the exercisers move to accommodate the step.

The static stretch periods after the short cardio bursts make no sense.  I can see a small ballistic stretch period after a muscle conditioning exercise, but after cardio?  There's really no reason for it......maybe a minor cool down but not a stretch.  Save the stretch for the end of the workout already.  I was not a fan of the canned and dated music.  Some of the songs you can hear on the Cathe CTX series which are some of Cathe's older workouts.  I just found Jari to be unmotivating and boring and the production was just not the quality I am used to.  I will stick to Cathe for my circuit workouts.  She does a much better job!",1449446400,,1919,4.394886363636363

2618318,2,B000GTJSVM,"I own a lot of advantage workout dvds. These is one of them.  I have to admit it is really exausting but also very, very boring. Jari Love is unfortunately lacking in ideas compared to for example Kelly Coffey or Cathe Friedrich. The different exercises consist only of ups and downs.

2618332,5,B000GTJSVM,"I have been doing this workout for years and I thought, it being one of my favorites, that it was about time I reviewed it!  I have many, many workout DVDs but have always used this one on a regular basis because it is just a great, solid workout.  I always feel like I have gotten a great, thorough workout after using it.  The key is using the appropriate weight.  I use heavier weight than Jari, you might need lighter until you build up your stength.  The compound moves, with challenging (sweating and shaking here, people) weights is going to strengthen your muscles, tone your body, shed inches, and strengthen your heart and lungs.  The format here is a great approach to overall fitness.  There are stretching and cooling-down breaks between sets.  If your aren't too busy sucking wind- you can just fast forward to the next set.  Overall a great workout that you can grow with by increasing your weights.",1370563200,2,914,4.627329192546584
2618333,5,B000GTJSVM,I love this I started off doing the 30 minute work outs first then progressed to the full workout I felt every muscle in my body for days but I can see the results. I have also been doing the extremely ripped 1000 as well. Since doing Jari work outs my bum has lifed my thighs have toned big time my husband has noticed the improvement and compliments me all the time I am 54 years old it is never too late to start I love the fact that I if I do not have a lot of time I can do a shorter workout by doing my upper or lower body and if I have the time I can do a full workout and I do not have to pay gym fees I can get fit from home.,1366156800,3,634,3.568345323741007
2618334,5,B000GTJSVM,"These workouts might put people off due to them being totally old-school, but I love Jari, her guiding technique throughout the DVD, and that she's not dragging you through terror.

2618336,5,B000GTJSVM,Great video.  VERY challenging workout for an intermediate exerciser.  I have been doing Ripped on and off for a while but the mix of cardio with Jari's usual weight training was excellent for keeping my heart rate high and burning lots of calories.

However, one of the things that I didn't think was very safe was that a lot of her cardio is done on the step but is done VERY quickly, sometimes running up, down, up, down.  I just did this on the floor.

The time went by so quickly that I couldn't believe it when we were at the cool down part.

I do wish that I was given advance notice that I needed to orient my step differently.

But for the most part, I really worked up a sweat.",1340841600,,571,3.8793103448275863

2618341,4,B000GTJSVM,"I thought this dvd was great as I wanted something that would burn a lot of calories. The only negative was I din't realise that you would need a step to enhance your workout and although they give you options without one, I think you would burn more calories with one. My only other negative would be that the stomach exercises at the end didn't go for very long. It definately gets your heart rate up.",1333238400,,403,4.315789473684211

2618343,5,B000GTJSVM,"This DVD is a fun combination of (mostly) compound weight moves alternated evenly with short bursts of increasing intensity cardio.  The moves are extremely easy to follow, & there are modifications (with a participant to watch) for literally every level from beginner to advanced, step or no step.  While this DVD isn't as difficult as ER1000, it is still definitely worth having (especially for the price), & I don't feel like my time was wasted after I've completed it.  This DVD has literally no dread factor, & I find Jari motivating yet calming, & very likeable.  I am also inspired by Jari's physique (she looks like she if naturally very slender, but she is seriously buff), as well as the other ripped participants.  One note: there are stretches after each muscle toning segment which decrease some of the intensity, but one could just continue lifting or get started on the cardio if you'd prefer.  I'd describe this video as advanced, though if you are used to tough workouts you may consider it intermediate-high, though it is not a waste of time & you will feel worked out afterwards (though not need-a-nap exhausted, like Insanity).  All in all, highly recommended for a fun, weight-cardio DVD!",1306886400,,1209,4.897058823529412

She is motivating and soothing all at the same time.  I'm not into the drill sergeants that feel like bulls charging at me.  She will make you work, you will get through it, and you will have worked your up a major dripping sweat.  It's awesome!",1303430400,,410,4.259740259740259
2618345,5,B000GTJSVM,"This workout is great. It mixes it up between cardio and weights. I think the cardio isn't as intense as I would like, but I just modify and take it up a notch. Jari is a great instructor, and the weight portion is her real strength. She is not annoying, and gets straight to the point. I like to switch off between cardio and weights, so the weight portion even feels like more of a workout. I highly recommend this video. I still love 50/50 Cardio and Weights by Angie Gorr which is similar, but yet a little more up-beat, and the cardio section is just a little more intense. I also like Jackie Warner's new video, the time savor. Overall I think Jari has excellent videos, and her form is really good. So many videos out there have poor form, but Jari really makes it a point to tell you how to do the moves correctly. I am an advanced exerciser, so I know how to do the moves, but if you don't, she really instructs you well. This workout is a lot harder with a step, so I highly recommend a step if you want a really intense workout.",1302825600,2,1039,4.174129353233831

Generally I rate it very high and view it as a natural progression from the previous 3 Ripped DVDs, which my wife and I have worked through over the past 3 1/2 years.

One caution, Ripped 1000 uses a lot of quick stepping, aerobic sets between the weight training. Many of the aerobics moves utilize the step. I found the use of the step at times dangerous, as it can be trip you up when you are exercising, and therefore I did most of the aerobics without the step.

I would recommend a buy on this DVD, but take it slow and carefully, and do it it only if you are in shape. This is not a beginners DVD.",1299283200,2,635,4.104838709677419

That is too bad as it could definately be taken slower (they demonstrate how to make it less difficult). I am 43 y.o., in fairly decent shape but was lacking in the exercise dept. for the last 6 months. It took me about 3 weeks of doing this video every other day before I could get through it. Now about 6 weeks into it, I am seeing changes in my body shape and the way I carry myself. It can be a little hard on the knees if not done properly.
To get the full workout for this video, you will need a step/bench and some different weights (3, 5, 8 or 10 lbs etc.)

Jari does say this video should not be done more than 3 times a week due to it's difficulty and risk of injury.

A have found that Jackie Warner's Xtreme Time saving workout (red/white cover) is good to use on some of the opposite days. It is about a half an hour in length, uses compound exercises as does Jari's, works some different muscles, though this too can be tough on the knees.",1298505600,,1031,4.073891625615763

2618353,4,B000GTJSVM,"Okay, so let's start by admitting that I goofed and ordered the wrong DVD. I wanted ""Get EXTREMELY Ripped 1000"" but I wasn't paying attention while filling my Amazon cart and got Get Ripped 1000 instead. Surprisingly, I don't regret it.

I'm an advanced exerciser these days - I do apprx 5/6 days of high impact cardio mixed with strength conditioning - and for my efforts I've dropped ~40 lbs in 1 1/2 yrs & can now slip my well toned rear into a size 4.

I wasn't the biggest fan of strength training but because of the success I had with Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred I decided to explore making it a larger part of my fitness routine. I'm still coming around to it though so I use ridiculously light weights [a mix of 1 lb and 3 lb hand weights - I know, I'm blushing] but shockingly I get a fantastic workout.

I still like Jillian better than Jari [dude, it's JILLIAN! How can you compete?!?] but I purchased Jari's Get Extremely Ripped and despite the leather pants and a couple of other quirks, I found it to be extremely effective. So I figured I'd take it up a notch to GER1000. I really like the cardio/strength format of 30 day shred and GER1000 sounded similar...

But, as I mentioned, I got GR 1000 instead. Yes it's got cardio combined w/ strength but, like other reviewers noted, the transitions are choppy [read: goofy 90s-esque graphics that seque into each segment].

What this means is you have to be really good at planning your workout space: have enough room to get busy on your step - if you use one [I don't - but I still have a designated ""cardio"" spot], have a place for your workout mat if you're on a hardwood floor to do pushups and abs, have a space where you'll do the weight bearing exercises when you're done with cardio.  If you plan your real estate well enough - ideally where you can walk over to each ""section"" fluidly - the transitions btwn the cardio and strength portions cease to be problematic.

So be sure to watch the entire DVD first or do a run through to figure out how you'll plan your space so transitions cause little to no interruption to your workout flow.

As for other details, well the music is...  as cheesy as the graphics and their gear and Jari's earlier personality is a little automaton-ish, and although all of this made me giggle snarkily, I was more pleased to see that I 1) stopped giggling due to sweat and exertion 2) consistently lose a pound of water weight according to the scale immediately after working out and 3) remained super sore for days after initiating this program.  And this with only 1 pound to 3 pound weights. Imagine if I jacked it up to 10-24 lb weights like Jari?

Further details: I like how the 3 background exercisers show modified versions of the moves but it IS hard to see all forms sometimes when the pesky camera guy gets a bad angle. However, that happens rarely and honestly, I can understand English, ergo Jari's instructions, and once you get the routine down you really don't need to be watching the TV screen like a hawk so I think this issue is surmountable. I really like the stretching between each segment as well; I know from other methods of workout that deep stretches after training a muscle can help it lengthen and carve out that sexy lean aesthetic many women desire.  Lastly, I particularly enjoy that the entire thing is just under 1 hour.

So I give this workout 4 stars because it definitely is challenging and will help get you/keep you fit and isn't that the whole reason to exercise in the first place? Better production quality [better transitioning, music, camera angles, etc.] would have brought the workout up to 5 stars, but close enough to perfect is good enough for me.",1272326400,5,3699,4.486607142857143
2618354,1,B000GTJSVM,"Based on the stellar reviews, I was so excited to try this workout DVD. I turned it off about 3/4 of the way through, feeling very strongly that I do not love Jari Love!

My biggest complaint is that this workout has no flow. I don't know why they broke it into segments, because at 1-2 minutes each, the segments are over before they've begun. It's hugely annoying that each segment starts with a title graphic telling you how many calories you will burn per minute. How useful is it to know that I'm burning 16.9 cal/min, if I'm only doing that move for ONE MINUTE? Then, equally annoying, is that each microsegment ends with stretching. Really, you do not need to stretch after every exercise.

I was looking forward to a challenging workout, and yes, the strength moves are quite challenging. But even I gave up when Jari announced that we're going to do 70 pushups. The cardio segments were too intense, too high-impact... and too short.

Overall, this DVD failed to hold together, and failed to hold my interest.",1272240000,9,1018,4.613259668508287
2618355,5,B000GTJSVM,"Traveling for work has ruined my workout schedule so after a year plus holidays, I'm out of shape.  Disappointing for a former college athlete.  I have all kinds of workout equipment and videos, I just bought Jari's set of 4 videos and *just* did the Get Ripped 1000.  I love it.  I've only loved one other workout video and I lost it.  I'm very happy, it's not boring, its very doable (I can tell when I'm getting trained) and I'll check in after a while to advise if I'm bored yet or have achieved my physical goals.

I highly highly recommend this series for anyone who is looking to get back into shape.  You do need some equipment (dumbbells and a step) but craigslist, amazon or your local garage sale will probably help out there.",1267488000,,737,4.4148148148148145
2618356,5,B000GTJSVM,"Other reviewers have already done excellent jobs of detailing how this DVD is structured and what exercises are included. I will keep this short and simple. This is the first Jari Love DVD that I have purchased and I must admit that before this DVD was recommended to me by Amazon, I was not familiar with her. I opted to rent the DVD first before I came back to Amazon to buy it. The fact that I liked it well enough to spend money on it says a lot, especially in this economy. Basically, I have a number of DVDs with intense cardio and a few DVDs and books that detail strength training. What I was looking for was a DVD I could do a couple of times per week that included both cardio and weights. Hence I found Get Ripped 1000 and was impressed. Like any DVD, it isn't perfect. There are a few times where I think the cueing is a bit off and I can't see Jari's movements. There are also a few places where the background music becomes loud and distracting. Sometimes the shift between weights and cardio can feel disjointed. There is no progress bar at the bottom of the screen, which I personally tend to like in a DVD. I noticed that other reviewers complained that it felt boring to them. I didn't feel that way but perhaps a cautionary note could be that if you don't like aerobics and/or you don't like DVDs where the trainer moves slowly initially to show people the form of the moves, this would not be a good selection for you. But overall, I was happy with it and I do plan to invest in some of Jari's other workout DVDs.

There seems to be some debate over whether a person could really burn 1000 calories with this workout. Typically, I am averaging between 800 and 1000. My caveat on that is: once I became familiarized with the moves, I do not stop or break in between sets. I try to jog in place to keep my heart rate up and the sweat flowing. It may not be helpful for everyone to do that but it works well for me. If you are looking for a DVD that will integrate both cardio and weights, I would highly recommend this one.",1265414400,3,2041,4.206632653061225

2618358,5,B000GTJSVM,"I like this DVD the best of the ones Jari did.
It's like circuit training between the cardio and weights.

2618360,5,B000GTJSVM,"The first time I did this workout, I HATED it. I'm an advanced exerciser and a cardio maniac whose routine workouts are super high-intensity, fast-paced sweatfests (think Amy Bento and Cathe Friedrich). Every aspect of Get Ripped 1000 annoyed me- the slow pace, the high reps, Jari's calm (some say boring) style, Jari's picture-perfect makeup and hairdo, the simple choreography, etc.

Well, I've found that integrating more weight training into my workouts leads to much more rapid and visible results, so recently I gave this one another try. Once I got past the grievances I listed above, I found that I liked it. I enjoyed the challenging, interval style, and to my surprise, the workout actually kept my heart rate up in the aerobic zone throughout (the key is in using appropriate weights for your fitness level).

The big surprise, however, occurred the next day: not only was I sore, I was EXHAUSTED. This interval training stuff works! My body is used to extreme exercise, but this workout truly challenged me and broke a plateau I didn't even know I was on. Within two weeks, my muscle tone had improved dramatically- especially in my abs and biceps.

This workout is now part of my regular routine and I LOVE the results. I highly recommend it to other cardio fanatics. You might not feel that intense cardio burn during and immediately after the workout (Imax 3 comes to mind), but you WILL feel how hard you worked the next day, and the results you achieve will be far beyond those you obtain with cardio alone.",1263254400,4,1525,4.768939393939394
2618361,5,B000GTJSVM,"I love this DVD. It is challenging, and of course as your strength increases you can change the weight. I like that it gives me a variety of exercise, and uses minimum equipment. I think that the interval style workout works well for me, because your heart rate never really goes down to resting. This DVD is more multi-joint strength exercise, with short cardio/step intervals. The newer Get Extremely Ripped 1000 has longer cardio intervals (the workout is a bit longer as well) I like to alternate these videos for my strength training days, and highly recommend both for weight loss and muscle toning. I find them much more fun than going to the gym, and I can't ever find an excuse not to do them when they are sitting right by the TV. I actually lost a couple pounds over the holidays!",1262131200,2,791,4.538461538461538
2618362,5,B000GTJSVM,"This is an excellent workout for more advanced exercisers.  There are modifications for beginners but this is a TOUGH workout that will challenge more advanced exercisers.
This workout uses hand weights, light barbells, and an aerobic step to target all the muscle groups of the body.  The workout begins with a warm-up with light weights.  The workup is broken into sections that each target a different body part.  Upper body and lower body are usually worked together (for example, a lunge and a curl may be combined to maximize calorie burn).  Each muscle group is worked with multiple exercises.  Besides Jari, there are three additional people performing each exercise and each person uses a different amount of weight and a different modification of the exercise.  There is usually one person doing a very advanced version of the exercise (something to work towards!) and one person doing a modified version for beginners.
In between the toning exercises, there are approximately 1 minute very intense cardio sessions on the step.  For each exercise group, they provide a note on how many calories are burned per minute.
Jari is a very upbeat instructor who is motivating without being annoying.  The ab section is adequate but could definitely be improved upon.  All together, this video is a really fun workout that targets all body parts.",1261958400,,1348,5.0588235294117645

I don't think this is a boring workout at all and I really like the stretching after each segment.  The fast cardio drills do wonders for my footwork.  I think the hardest cardio segment is the jumping jacks with the step.  My least favorite segment is the ""Push Up Party"", but I don't give up and it really does get easier!!!  But they all get my heart pumping.  I try to do this workout twice a week while alternating with the other Jari workouts.

This is not a hard core body building workout but I feel that it can put you on that track if you wanted to. I love the cardio she infuses...I do wish their was a little more of it but I have enough cardio DVD's to make up for it.

2618367,5,B000GTJSVM,"You had better be psyched up before you start this workout because it's no joke.  As others have mentioned, it's a mix of COMPOUND (meaning you are working two or more muscle groups at onces, usually upper body and lower body)strength exercises and short bursts of cardio.  When I first realized that the cardio segments were only around a minute or two, I was like - whatever, that will be too easy.  Yeah right!  It may be short, but it's very challenging.  Thankfully, for me, because to say I'm uncoordinated and not dance-inclined is an understatment, the step moves are quite simple... nothing complicated you have to worry about figuring out how to follow along with.  The football drill (if you've done this yet, you know what I'm talking about) is my worst enemy.  It's so hard.  I'm always about ready to die before she finally says, ""let's cool it down.""  The strength moves are equally basic.  You can make them easier by going lighter with your weights.  I'm not going to lie - the heaviest dumbells I use are 8s.  Most exercises I use just 5s.  I am hoping to increase soon.  I'm a fairly scrawny person, but I've been a dilligent exerciser for years, so go figure.  The push-ups as others have commented are hard-core (70 reps!).  I can keep up on my knees, but when I'm done my armpit area is aching like crazy.

Btw, just to give you a heads up, you might want to have your remote handy because the workout moves so fast, you may not have time to invert your step the right way, clear some space, and put your weights aside between the segments.  I usually have to pause it for a second to get set up for the next exercise.

Oh, and be prepared for a drab backgroud.  I believe that's how all of Jari's video's are.  She is no fluff or nonsense and her background isn't either.  It's actually kind of strange - there's like a couch and coffee table in the backgroud.  What?  Are they all going to sit down and have tea and strumpets after the workout?

Anyway, it's an awesome workout and you will burn a TON of calories doing it.  By doing Jari's video's I've been able to see real tone in my body for the first time.  It's nice.  Just make sure you have some kind of supplemental abs routine because for some reaon hers are never the best.  Again, doesn't make sense, she's got a washboard stomach, but her abs segments usually suck pretty bad.  Sorry Jari.

2618368,3,B000GTJSVM,"I've tried a lot of different exercise forms and DVDs; my favorites are Jillian Michaels'. I bought this for a new challenge, but I was not at all impressed with it.

The DVD definitely has valid strength training moves and tips on form, and it allows for people who want to use higher weights. It almost seems more geared to bodybuilding than fitness/weightloss. It also uses step cardio, so if you enjoy that it may be worthwhile.

However, I really hated doing this DVD. It was quite boring, and while the strength moves were effective, I didn't think the cardio really was. My heart rate was not ever very elevated, and the DVD is quite awkwardly structured so that there are long chapter breaks between sets. Basically, you're standing and staring at the screen a lot. I also just had a problem with Jari Love. I knew nothing of her before this, and as an instructor I felt she really lacked in terms of motivation. I'm not someone who likes ""chirpy"" people, but she was almost just...quiet. And to be completely honest, I was kind of turned off by her ""look""; she just looks unhealthily thin to me, and it started to get to me a bit.

Overall, I can't fault the concept, I suppose. But the video seemed so long and drawn out, and I felt like it wasted a lot of my time. Needless to say, I never use it. So if considering a purchase, I would have to recommend a pass.",1246406400,,1372,4.393700787401575

I work out in the AM at home 5 days a week and use (among others) The Firm, Jillian Michaels and Results Fitness - have tried others and as usual some of The Firm are not my favorites but I was hoping for a tough workout with this Get Ripped 1,000 and was disappointed.  The toning segments are a good combination of both compound and isolation exercises, performed on and off the step bench which adds to the challenge, but I certainly was disappointed in the cardio segments for 2 reasons:  (1) the cardio segements are way too short - my heart rate and breathing just didn't get up there and (2) I love step aerobics and although most of these were basic athletic or step moves many of the routines are way too fast to be safely performed using a step. An example would be the ""up, up, down, down"" segment, where you're essentially running straight up and down the step where the chance of a misstep is high.  Talk about a major trip hazard! The ""up and over the step with jumping jacks"" segment was a more safe and practical routine, however. They give you the option of doing them on the floor or modified but then you really aren't getting any cardio.
I also didn't like the way you stood around for what seemed like forever during the choppy chapter breaks after each cardio or weight segment.  I took to running during those breaks trying to get my heart rate up.  I also felt the ab work in this workout was very limited and whimpy.
I purchased this based on some of the high reviews it received but after giving it 4 tries now it will be on the bottom of my exercise ""favorites list"".",1241049600,3,1641,4.328990228013029

I'm not sure why people would say they get bored doing this workout.  It is repetitive in some sense, but that is why you are getting the great results.  The repetition of the exercises combined with different timing make the workout incredibly effective. I find that I don't get bored because the dvd is divided into cardio and weight training segments so each segment is only a few minutes.

2618374,4,B000GTJSVM,"This is the first Jari Love DVD I have ever tried, and it worked me so hard I had sweat flinging all over the place by the time I was done.  It's a more advanced weight-lifting workout, with *very* short cardio intervals in-between the weight lifting sets that use an aerobic step.  I found the moves (especially the pulsing moves) quite challenging and effective.  Here's the good and the bad:

The good:

--Very challenging moves (my legs are like jello today because of those pulsing squats and lunges!)
--Heart rate is kept up by the compound moves she does during the weight-lifting segments, and is kept up during the cardio segments
--Good ab segment at the end that works all parts of the abs
--Will leave you the ""good sore"" the next day
--If you really push yourself and use a weight that leaves your muscles properly fatigued, I am sure this will get you huge results. (I always use lighter weights the first time I do a workout so I don't injure myself.)
--I enjoyed the small stretch breaks she gives you at the end of each segment.
--I was drenched in sweat by the end of this.

The bad:

--I wanted to quit about 30 minutes into it!  Not because it was too hard. . .but because I was rather bored.  The moves are repetitive.
--Jari is obviously a good instructor, but she is lacking in personality somewhat to sufficiently motivate me to complete her workout.(I did complete it, but I really had to push myself.)
--During the footwork in the cardio segments, I kept yelling at the TV for them to SHOW ME THEIR FEET.  During some moves, you couldn't see what they were doing with their feet!  And when you're jumping up and down on a step, you really want to make sure you're doing a fast-paced move correctly and safely.
--I had some coordination issues with the cleans and presses. . more instruction on how to do these safely would have been nice.

The good clearly outweights the bad here, but I thought it important to note the boredom that set in while I was working out.  I will do this workout again, but I am going to give her a fair chance and try one of her other workouts first (Ripped & Chiseled) to see if I can be convinced to buy any more of her DVDs.  All in all, I would recommend this to someone who really wants to get ripped and get a good cardio workout in at the same time (and who doesn't bore easily!).",1238025600,3,2341,4.364055299539171

It is definitely one of the more challenging DVD's I have, but I will say, I still found it to be fairly easy at times.  I really liked that this DVD is not like the other Ripped ones I have as it incorporates cardio.  However, the cardio ""bursts"" are often short (30 seconds, I think) and then there's an even longer stretch time afterwards.  So, like another reviewer, I felt I was standing around more than necessary.  Additionally, the first time I did this DVD I found that I had to let each chapter start and then watch it for a minute to see what was going to come up- the cueing should have been better so I could avoid this additional standing around.

I did it twice, and decided that was enough for me. I also found all their bodies disgusting. Over tanned, zero body fat, nastiness. Her body doesn't motivate me at all. Also, what's with her asking ""Are you smiling?"" It made me want to punch her in the face! I was so annoyed at her saying that. She said it like three times, and always at moments when I really wouldn't be smiling. All in all, I like Tracie Long better.",1227657600,2,917,3.935483870967742
2618382,4,B000GTJSVM,"My wife and I got this product after using the Chiseled DVD.  We found that one to be challenging and effective.  The pulsing and isolated body party segments really hit the mark.

This DVD does a fairly good job in the weightlifting department as well.  There are some different movements (i.e. hang clean and side lunges) that are nice variations.

The issue I have are the cardio segments in between.  1.) They're not challenging 2.) they're not creative 3.) they're pretty annoying.

What they do help provide is extended rest periods.

Overall, the workout is strong enough to make up for the Cardio sections short comings.",1227484800,3,628,4.8584905660377355

2618384,4,B000GTJSVM,"I got this in a 4 pack of Jari Love DVDs.  This was the first I tried.  Pretty challenging.  I was impressed.  I liked how she calmly explained the moves...no yelling or cutsie stuff.  There is a lot of back and forth between the cardio/step and weights which breaks up the workout.  But the cardio segments felt a little short.

I have been doing The Firm DVDs lately.  This is significantly harder than those.

I hope the rest of the DVDs in the pack are up to the same standards.",1226275200,,482,4.266666666666667
2618385,5,B000GTJSVM,"On those days when I'm in the mood for a workout challenge, this is often the DVD I pull out.  Unlike some of Jeri's other DVDs which seem to focus mostly on weights, this has really high intensity cardio interspersed throughout. It's a great balance of lower body squats and deadlifts and upper body work (flies, overhead presses, anterior lifts) - mixed with plyo-type football runs and jumping jacks off a step. I end up the hour happily drenched in sweat, a bit shaky...and somewhat sore the next day.",1222646400,,505,4.674157303370786
2618386,5,B000GTJSVM,"This is an awsome work-out!!!  I have soo much fun with this one!  I have owned this video for about 8 weeks, and am not bored of it...and still find it challenging.  I also own Jari  Love's Slim and Lean and Ripped:to the Core.  Those two dvd's are only lifting (higher reps, 'till it burns).  1000 his a mix a cadio-burst and lifting, during the dvd the screen will notify what they are lifting in the class and average/max calories burned doing the exersize. The title 1000, is that you can burn around 1000 calories in this workout!!!!  I mix up all of her dvds. I have more muscle definition and have increased endurance, great for cross training.

I have done many fitness DVDs, this is currently my favorite.  I bought the entire beachbody P90x pack (very very expensive and time consuming; great for men who wanna get big!) and completed it, those are also great DVDs, but I personally found for Me that Jari's high reps/pulsing techniques creates more pump (over-load) in my muscle fibers and I noticed results faster!  great for women who want a sexy toned looked! During all 3 of Jari's workout's I own I could really feel that I worked my muscle to the point of improvement  (the awesome burn, it is great!) I actually can workout less days of the week and still see results (4 days a week..I'll do 5 if I'm not too sore), whereas with p90x you are required all 7 days per week, each day over 1 hr, some time 1.5 hrs!

(also, these dvd have great audio and video-clear....well done-not cheap like others I bought)

I consider myself to be advanced, I do Jari's Core, Chiseled, Lean and 1000 with a cardio day in between. (If anyone can tell me what good cardio DVD's are out there I would love to hear!) Cardio for me is usually a 5K run/jog. Jari's DVDs are phenomenal, well cued and very motivational. Her approach is amazing and for those of you who question if this workout really burns 1000 calories, you should probably google ""afterburn"" and educate yourselves on what that means. An efficient workout taps out all of your carb reserves so you can go on burning fat and calories throughout the day. Jari is truly an inspiration, she wants us all to be in the best shape ever. Finally for those who didn't think there was enough ab work if you are engaging your abs (as she instructs) throughout the entire work out you are working your core. Have fun with this one and most of all find something that suits your style and continue with your workouts!

2618390,1,B000GTJSVM,"I was highly disappointed by this video, particularly because I feel that the description and reviews were misleading.  Don't be fooled - this is a STEP AEROBICS video. Several reviewers said that you could get a good workout without the step.  While it is true that there are modifications offered, it basically amounts to marching in place or jumping jacks.  For some people the heavy emphasis on the step may be fine, but I hate step aerobics (hello 1980s!).  Also, I didn't find the workout challenging at all, and I find it very hard to believe that anyone could possibly come close to burning 1000 calories.",1217721600,13,613,4.754716981132075
2618391,5,B000GTJSVM,"This is as hardcore as a strength training workout can get! This would be either circuit training or HIIT. Whatever you wanna call it, it's insanely good! I am a HUGE fan of Jari Love and this workout rocks! I have all of her tapes but this one stands alone. It's her usual weight room style lifting but instead of having time to breath as you switch sets, you do high impact cardio in between. I burn about 500 or so calories doing this and my heart rate looks like a roll-a-coaster, up,down,up,down! For this tape you need weights, I just use 3 or 5lb dumbbells, and an aerobic step to REALLY get every last drop of sweat out of you! It starts with a fast warm up than you head into weight lifting sets, which work each and every muscle. Than as that set ends you hit up the cardio until you can't lift your legs! Than it's back to catching your breath as you lift weights. Highly effective workout. Personally I strength train 3x a week using this tape 1x a week and alternating her other tapes, either RTTC,S&L or R&C 2x a week. This will not make you bulk up, it trims and tones you out. Perfect addition to every fitness routine!",1217635200,,1135,4.283720930232558

Get Ripped! with Jari Love did just that - it's a killer workout and is definitely not for wussies. It's an hour combo of cardio and weights with no down time and it will exhaust you completely. I have rotated this into my workouts about twice a week, no more, because it's extremely intense. There are additional trainers working behind Jari that show modifications for each exercise, which is great for varied levels of fitness.

2618395,5,B000GTJSVM,This is a great advanced level workout with both cardio and strength.  I am dripping in sweat when I finish it and it's hard to find a dvd that works you that hard.  They give options for beginners so I guess this could work for anyone as long as you're careful. They also show options for equipment. The cardio bursts definitely get your heart rate up.  I feel like I'm seeing changes in my upper body pretty quickly after doing this video for about 1 month.  The music is probably the only drawback because it's very generic club type music.  I also bought the Ripped to the Core and Ripped Slim and Lean and I like switching back and forth among the three.  I feel like I'm getting a club type workout without leaving the house with these videos.  Definitely worth the money.,1214179200,2,778,4.398601398601398

2618398,5,B000GTJSVM,"This is the first Jari Love video I have tried and I love it!! It really pushed me. Although it was hard, Jari kept you motivated. She has quite a different style to most other instructors in that she is soft spoken.

The video itself keeps you on your toes as it intervals between weights and cardio on a step. There are floor alternatives as well. The weight sections are longer and the cardio bursts last about a minute. She always makes sure that you stretch after each segment. The weights segments are high reps eg. 70 push ups, 36 clean and press etc. But she changes the timings and mixes it around including little jerks and half movements. You can really feel the burn in the muscles!

Although it is quite long (about 55 minutes) the time passes really quickly. I am not sure what data she uses to state how many calories are burnt per minute in the front of each segment. My heart rate monitor told me I only burnt about 300 cals although it is supposed to burn up to 1000.

All in all, I highly recommend this video to anyone wanting to break out of a plateau or have a workout that is challenging with enough modifications to keep you working hard for a long time.",1210982400,,1178,4.321266968325792
2618399,5,B000GTJSVM,"This is one of, if not the best, weight training workout DVDs, and I've done a lot of them. This is a fantastic workout; you will fully sweat, which for me is the sign of a truly gratifying workout. You work hard, and it's worth it. I'm in good shape and totally enjoy doing this DVD. I think Jari Love paces everything incredibly well; nothing bores me, and I'm continually challenged while honestly having fun because I can feel every muscle I'm engaging. I like the number of reps she does, too. The entire workout is formatted very well.

My one complaint is that I've had to abstain from using this DVD in my current apartment because I have a sensitive downstairs' neighbor, and the step segments can be loud (though they're my favorite parts, football run!) Also, Jari is pretty buff muscle-wise, which is not my goal. I've done the workout for a steady year and have not accrued that type of bulk, but I'm sure you can if that's your goal. Jari's workout people are a nice array of real humans. (Yay, Canada)

Jari really keeps you motivated and pumped up to get you through the workout.  I have been doing her workouts for 2 weeks now and I can already feel and see the difference in my body/muscles.

I read about Jari Love's Ripped 1000 DVD in the magazine, Oxygen, and thought I would give this one a try.  I was so impressed with Jari and her workout style and the results I am already receiving, that I ordered all 4 of her other DVD's!

Thanks Jari for being such a great inspiration in sculpting one's body, as well as the mind.  ""If you want it, you can acheive it"".",1209945600,,680,4.152671755725191

The compound moves really get your heart pumping and the cardio intervals are simple and easy to do. Jari really knows how to combine a series of excercises that make a great total body workout. My one criticism is that the abs section is really short, not a lot to it. But overall I highly recommend this for intermediate excercisers!",1209340800,,502,4.239583333333333
2618402,5,B000GTJSVM,"Another great Jari Love video.  This is the toughest of all her workouts that I have done to date (I have not done the last one).  A word of advice - do the modifications if necessary.  I caused an old knee injury to flare up while doing the jumping jacks on and off the step.  My fault, though, not Jari's.  She provides lots of modifications for the exercises.  I should have known better than to jump off the step with both feet at the same time.  This workout is great because you get your cardio and weight training done simultaneously.  I have to say that I don't necessarily follow the music for all of the cardio - it is really fast.  I just go as fast as I can and if it is slower than the Rippers, so be it.  I am still getting a great workout.",1208131200,,754,4.068027210884353

The cardio version of Ripped 1000 makes this workout feel a little bit more complete than just strength and weights alone. I consider myself in great shape, and so far, Jari Love's workouts continues to be a challenge.  I see results I haven't seen from taking strenth classes at the gym.  Perhaps it is Jari's repititions and pulses that are doing the trick to transform my body! You will need a step for this workout, although she offers a modification for without a step. The step portions, thankfully are not complicated; they are simple steps that gets my heart pumping. She also incorporates squats and other leg exercises to be done on the step. I recommend using both hand weights and a body bar for this workout.  The only small drawback is I wish there was more attention to the triceps.

2618406,5,B000GTJSVM,"Excellent video that keeps your heart rate high throughout. I sweat like crazy with this video, and suck down water as quick as I get a chance to. Excellent calorie burner.

I've been using Jari's ""Ripped 1000"" and ""ripped to the core"" and ""Ripped and Chiseled"". I realized that the three DVDs have slightly different focus.

- Ripped 1000's focus is mixing cardio with weight reps, your heart rate is elevated throughout because of the cardio portions. On average I consume 20 oz of water during this video and seems to sweat them all out.

- ""Ripped to the Core"" is slightly less cardio than 1000, but lots of compound exercises that involve both upper and lower body at the same time. Heart rate is elevated but not nearly as much as 1000. I can get away with drinking 15oz of water.

- ""Chiseled"" is less bouncy. More focus on each muscle group. Especially the back, arms, shoulders and chest. Because of the large amount of upper body work, my heart rate is not as high as the other two, but the upper body muscles do get more work. Because of the lower cardio, I perspire a lot less, and can get away with drinking 8oz of water. I am sore after using Chiseled even after I've been working with 1000 for a several weeks. Definitely rotate the DVDs.",1206662400,9,1253,4.458515283842795

2618412,3,B000GTJSVM,"This is a great workout. Jari is positive and her cueing is good.

However, it seemed to go on forever, especially with all the chapter breaks where you're just standing around--this is where they could have listed how much/which weights to use and how to orient your step so you could be ready for the next segment. Also, I didn't care for the stretch breaks ending each segment, as they didn't help to keep your heart rate up--would much rather have a longer total stretching/cool-down segment at the end.

Since it was chaptered, and plays in a chaptered fashion, I was surprised that you could not customize it to do the weight segments only, or cardio only,  or mix up the order of the segments.

Finally, where are the diet tips and recipes that were advertised on the DVD cover? Couldn't locate them on my copy, even looking through all the bonus features.

This would be a good DVD to use with Callanetics, since Callanetics has a better abs section and more stretching, but no cardio/weight-bearing sections.",1199836800,12,1017,4.72316384180791

There's a section that you do 70 push-ups in a row which really helps with upper body strength.  Surprisingly on my first try, I was able to do all 70 on my toes.

I really like how there is not an excessive amount of talking and a short warm-up. Excellent strength training/cardio combo.",1191110400,,444,4.36144578313253
2618422,3,B000GTJSVM,"About 2 minutes after you've begun, there's a description of what's next and then you're into the next exercise. I'd prefer to have the instructor lead right into the next exercise move instead of making me stand there for 20 seconds waiting for the next exercise. To top that off, most of the times the next exercise requires an adjustment of the stepper. Ugh!! There's not a continual flow, which is what I'm used to. Other than that, the video gives a good workout.",1190246400,5,468,4.583333333333333

I like it b/c its so intense. jari isn't annoying however she is very very dry. all she can say is ""up up, down down, up up, down down..."" and ""great on you"". She is not overly inspiring so you really need to be in themood to committ to the workout. Its an hour long, but the intervals make it go by a little faster. When I'm feeling sluggish I just take breaks b/w intervals. Its a lot of squats and lounges and combo moves. Very good work out. I hi-ly recomend it.",1187827200,,599,4.042016806722689

2618425,1,B000GTJSVM,"I have tried Jari Love's get ripped 1000 and thought it was awful. The cardio segments are not heart raising at all. I couldn't disagree more with the other reviewers and found that the exercises were choppy and the flow of the dvd was horrible. At one point they were doing jumping jacks using a step and one of the participants doesn't have a step so he just does about 100 jumping jacks! Not only can that be dangerous but it is also extremely boring. I would not recommend this to anyone even a beginner. I would instead recommend Cathe Freidrich whom will make you no gaurantees about getting ""ripped"" but you can be sure that you will be stronger, leaner, happier, healthier and you can bet more fit and toned. Also you can preview almost all of Cathe's workouts about 10 minutes worth. At least you know that you are getting a quality product, instead of just a gaurantee. Oh and the success stories on Get Ripped 1000 not only do I not believe them at all but they are also laughable. Sorry this is so harsh but there are better products out there ones that don't make promises of ""getting ripped"" and then when you don't you give up on yourself!!!!!",1186185600,17,1158,4.44131455399061
2618426,5,B000GTJSVM,This is the fourth workout dvd I have from Jari Love and I absolutely love it. The workout starts with a warm up then stretching and right into the cardio sessions. It alternates between weight exercises and cardio in order to raise the heart rate and lower it. The various sessions make it up beat and constant alert making time go by so fast. This is definitely a challenging dvd for a beginner but not impossible. I workout regularly but I still found this challenging and great for loosing weight. I was sweating the whole time and by the end felt good about the workout. The abs workout helped me cool down and bring my heart rate back to normal while managing to kick out a few crunches. I recommend this video to anyone who would like to lose weight and increase muscle mass.,1185753600,2,782,4.4375
2618427,5,B000GTJSVM,"This dvd was recommended by Fitness magazine, so I decided to give it a try. It's awesome! It takes about 1 hr, but it alternates between cardio and strength training. At the end there's a couple ab exercises then stretching. I do it about 2-3 times a week, because of the high intensity. The cardio is fast paced, and you'll be huffing and puffing to keep up. (I do!) Plus she includes variations to the exercises, in case you don't have a step or if you need lower intensity. One exercise you do 70 push-ups. But it's broken down, you do 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, then 4, with stretches after each set. When I started the video a couple weeks ago I could do about 40, but now I can do 70! (I still do them on me knees, but this week I'm going to start them the right way.) I'm getting toned allover, especially my lower body, which is my problem area! This is definately worth it!",1185148800,3,878,4.170588235294118

2618429,3,B000GTJSVM,"This is a good work out, in which you burn many calories. The downside for me is that they don't cue the moves or tell you that you need to change the position of your step, which is a common occurence throughout the work-out. I find myself hitting pause and/or rewind quite frequently.

Not to discourage as you will sweat!!",1184198400,4,325,4.416666666666667
2618430,5,B000GTJSVM,"Ripped 1000 is instructor Jari Love's fourth DVD.  In this workout, she combines some of the best aspects of her three previous releases plus adds a new twist, cardio intervals.  Ripped 1000 follows the same basic principle as the original Get Ripped--ie, you will do a small series of exercises using a high number of repetitions and varied counts (4-4, 3-1, 2-2, etc.).  From her second workout, Slim & Lean, Jari includes pulsing reps, and she also includes compound moves similar to those found in her third workout, Ripped to the Core.  As I mentioned above, Ripped 1000 also adds cardio intervals using a step (but modifications are always shown without).  All of this, and you get Jari's simple, no-nonsense instruction style as well.

The Main Menu on this DVD is as follows:  Introduction--Full Workout--Full Workout (Cardio Modifications)--Exercises--Bonus Features--Credits.  For the Full Workout with Cardio Modifications, an inset appears on screen showing an alternative option.  The Exercises segment is basically a chapter breakdown showing the 20 total chapters:  warm-up, 9 cardio segments, 9 strength segments (including abs), and cool-down.  Here as with all of the Ripped DVDs, Jari works out with four background exercisers, each of whom shows varying equipment, modificiations, and weight loads (the latter of which are helpfully shown on screen at the start of every exercise).

As in her other workouts, Jari uses light weights for the warm-up and quickly moves through all of the major muscles of the body in the form of squats, side squats, dead lifts, bicep curls, and overhead presses.  She then sets the weights down to do some warming up on the step, and she finishes with some stretches for a total of about 5 minutes.  The workout itself alternates short cardio intervals (about 1.5 minutes each) with weight segments.  For the cardio segments, Jari performs a single move, starting off slow, moving to a quick tempo, then going back to slow and ending with a stretch (there's no choreography to learn).  Each weight segment ends with a stretch as well.  Here is a general breakdown of the workout:

Warm-Up
Cardio 1 (stepovers with jacks)
Side Squat with Lunge Back
Cardio 2 (pulsing squat to skiers)
Stiff Leg Deadlift with Reverse Lunge
Cardio 3 (front toe taps)
Pulse Squat-Pulse Lunges
Cardio 4 (up-up down-down)
Push-Ups (70 declining reps--ie, 16-14-12-10-8-6-4)
Cardio 5 (up-up down-down, other leg)
Clean and Press
Cardio 6 (side taps to skier)
Wide Leg Squat with Biceps Curl
Cardio 7 (down-jack up-jack)
Triceps Extension with Leg Abduction (very unique balance move)
Cardio 8 (football runs)
Chest Press and Chest Flye
Cardio 9 (football runs, other leg)
Abs (lying to stand move with weight, straight leg hip raises, legs in and out, crunch with single leg squeeze, double leg lowers, brief bicycle)
Stretch (floor, standing, step)

The entire workout comes in at just under an hour.  I'm a high intermediate exerciser, and I was able to follow Jari's weight loads for most of the moves.  However, sometimes I had to modify the compound moves by doing the lower body only, and the only way I made it through the push-up sequence is by doing them on my knees and resting during the 6 reps.  For the most part, however, the workout felt quite doable (for some reason, I found this one a bit easier than Ripped to the Core), so I was surprised that after doing it the first time, I was sore for days after!  One last thing:  the name of this workout supposedly comes from the idea that you will burn 1000 calories while doing it.  That seems a little far-fetched to me, but according to my HR moniotr, I'm generally burning close to 500, which I think is still pretty darn good for a 1-hour workout.  Get Ripped 1000 is definitely an intermediate to advanced workout that will challenge most exercisers out there; highly recommended!",1183939200,119,3876,4.95208655332303
2618431,5,B000GTJSVM,"This workout is awesome!  Somehow, you work you a** off, and definitely feel it after, but the workout is doable b/c she cuts it up into mini mini segments.

It is about the only thing that has worked really well for me. I've gained a lot of strength but have actually gotten smaller muscles, not bigger ones.

2618439,5,B000GTJSVM,"I love all the Jari Love DVD's.  Back when I started doing them, I had a question about something, and e-mailed Jari through her website.  She did not e-mail me back, SHE CALLED ME!!!!  When has that ever happened before!  She has a customer for life, so it is a good thing her products are awesome.  My only problem after getting Ripped 1000 is that I don't want to do any of my other workouts including the other Ripped series.  That is because when I complete the 1000 I know I have gotten the most thorough workout I could possibly get.

I would suggest, if you are a beginner, either start with another Ripped DVD and work up through that or be prepared to do the cardio modifications and use lighter weights than you usually would.  Jari promises the ""best shape ever"", and if you build up to doing Ripped 1000 started to finish 3 times a week, you will be!  I feel like at 43 I am in better shape than ever, and my 15 year old daughter just commented on how ""buff"" my arms are!",1179705600,10,984,4.219251336898396

I workout 7 days a week and I'd say I'm high intermediate to advanced at this point.  This DVD gives me a great workout every time and I find I still have some areas I have to work up to meet the challenge, i.e. the 70 push ups on the toes.  I'm at 52 with the rest on the knees at the moment. I really like her style which is very supportive and genuine. I like the interval nature of her workouts where you do some pretty intense cardio followed by weight training with stretches after each and none of them too long.  The hour flies by.  I give it two thumbs up especially if you are looking for a new challenge.",1179014400,10,719,3.9652777777777777
2618441,5,B000GTJSVM,"I ordered this DVD after I ordered ""Get Ripped! To the Core"". I really enjoy the Jari Love DVDs. I'm not new to workout DVDs, but I needed something to do other than my older Tea Bo workouts.

This DVD is different than the other Ripped! discs because it incorporates cardio workouts. After every toning exercise there's different styles of cardio. This disc also features a choice to play the workout with cardio modifications, which is nice if you're newer to working out or just don't feel quite comfortable with the workouts yet.

Two things that I love about the DVDs is that no matter what level you're at you can use them; there's three people along with Jari who demonstrate the workouts at different levels, so whether you're a beginning or advanced you can use this DVD. Another thing that I like is that if you're rushed you can selected any exercise you want. (My older workout DVDs I'd have to fast forward through the workout).

I love Jari Love DVDs now. She's not cheesey and doesn't just do workouts without explaining them. She'll explain the form you're supposed to have and what muscles you're working. She throws in an occasional ""Good job"", ""You can do it"", and ""Looks good on you"", but she's not cheesey about it.

This DVD is challenging, but you can always pause and come back! She's like a personal trainer any time of the day!",1177977600,20,1353,4.601659751037344

I got it to work 3 times and then had to exchange it.  There was no problem exchanging but I had to pay shipping all over again and then this one has only worked 2 times and has started screwing up.  I have Ripped to the Core and Slim & Lean and have had no problems but there must be a bad batch that Amanzon has that was burned onto crappy CD's.

2618445,5,B000GTJSVM,My wife and I do this together and I jump around like a clod but get better every time so it is tough enough to provide some challenge and make it interesting. It is fast paced enough to not get frustrating or boring. The first time I was crawling around on my hands and knees at the end but now I can pretty much keep up but it is still a challenge to do all the reps and keep in form. Jari is a good combination of personality and serious trainer. The backups are in various stages of fit so you can see alternative moves. This has been good for me and having company has helped my wife stay on it and I like the results.,1174348800,4,623,3.9523809523809526

Jari does not act fake. The music timing is good, the reps are longgggg.....I used light weight the first time through, but will challenge myself with my second workout.  GREAT modifications for those that do not have a ""step"" or do not want to have the expense of buying one.  The team on the DVD provides 3-4 different ways to do all work outs, high intensity, low intensity, with a step,without, low weights, high weights....without the feeling of the workout being interrupted.

2618449,5,B000GTJSVM,"If you are looking for a challenging workout, this is it.  There are 11 segments (including abs, stretch and warm up).  Note that I do not recommend Jari Love's DVDs for the beginning exerciser.  Even lowering the weights could be too challenging, and not using weights not challenging enough.  Further, they are very repetitive, which, could prove boring to the beginning exerciser. The sections are weight training alternated with cardio intervals.  The weight training is moderately difficult (not as challenging as Slim & Lean); but the cardio sections are very challenging.  If you are a beginning exercise, I encourage you to choose the full workout with cardio modifiers track on the main menu.  This gives you the 4th possible way to do the cardio workout; Jari goes back and forth from middle to difficult, then her assistants show easy (on the floor w/o the step), and middle to hard.  The cardio modifier depicts using the step but not at the same pace as the regular workout.  You will need 5, 8, 10, and 12 pound weights or a dumbbell, and a step.  If you only have the Firm fanny lifter, I do not recommend using it as it could be a hazard.  The cardio is extremely rapid, and involves fast paced footwork, while not complicated, requires concentration to avoid tripping.  Given the difficulty of this workout, there is a great sense of accomplishment afterwards.  Note:  Jari's DVDs are not known for their ab work.  One would think that since they kick your rear-end for the main part of the DVD, that the ab work would as well, but it is very easy work, and only 50 reps.",1170028800,23,1588,4.682310469314079

When you first start, you're going to be out of breath (especially when adding in the step), you're going to be sweaty, you're going to feel it the next day-but it's the good kind of pain.

You've got to stick with it, because you won't see a huge difference in the first month, which can be frustrating. But the second month your body really starts to tone up and by the end of the third month you'll look and feel great. I mix them up, but I like ripped 1000 the best.
