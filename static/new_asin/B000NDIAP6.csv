2767587,5,B000NDIAP6,"This movie captures Al Franken during some of his more interesting moments; for example:

1. Fighting with Bill O'Reilly.

2. Arguing with Sean Hannity.

3. Helping to start Air America.

4. Entertaining the troops in Iraq.

5. Arguing with Michael Medved.

6. Talking with Ann Coulter.

7. Covering the Republican convention while being blocked by goons.

8. Meeting enemies at a conservative party.

It is well made and gives an interesting insight.

Enjoy!",1177632000,9,459,5.164383561643835
8177414,3,B000NDIAP6,"After writing a book about who he thinks lies he goes on a book tour. He joins an aspiring liberal radio network and visits the 2004 Presidential Conventions to argue with other (more successful) talkers. Clips from SNL appear. He goes on a USO tour.

When John Kerry loses al considers running for office. He objectifies women and tells a raw joke and does not understand why it is not appropriate. Swearing.",1511136000,,409,4.680555555555555

8177416,4,B000NDIAP6,"Was there to be a part two?  The 2006 documentary AL FRANKEN: GOD SPOKE leaves the viewer hanging as it concludes with comedian/poltical commentator Al Franken leaving it all behind to run for the United States Senate.

Did he win?  We'll just have to wait for part two to find out!

Along with most Dan Aykroyd sketches my favorite segment on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE  was ""The Franken and Davis Show,"" featuring Franken and the late Tom Davis.  Of all the S.N.L. skits that became movies, Franken's funny and heartwarming STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY is the best I've seen.

The Al Franken book LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM, which exposes the Republican noise machine, ""Saved my life,"" according to someone who told me she started reading it after a distressing day on the job and laughed so much she was able to get the night's sleep she thought she would miss.

Al Franken was the cornerstone of Air America radio, where his talent lost no punch in the theater of the mind.  As a bonus, I discovered Thom Hartmann, who replaced Franken when he left to run for the Senate and has become one of my favorite talk show hosts.

Some of the above is in AL FRANKEN: GOD SPOKE and some isn't.  I realize I'm reviewing Al Franken's career as much as this documentary but the film ties it together neatly for me because watching it, I realize the man's done everything he's tried well. How many others can claim success as an actor, author, radio commentator and politician?  (Okay, I ruined the surprise of part two if it's ever made; Al Franken won the election!)",1443484800,,1559,4.548387096774194
8177417,4,B000NDIAP6,"It was cool to see the behind-the-scenes video from events, but it would have been REALLY nice to see his campaign for MN Senate race.",1350345600,,134,4.4
8177418,1,B000NDIAP6,"After hearing all the press about Al Franken, I thought this would be an interesting and insightful movie to watch. A comedian turned politician sounded interesting, but it was anything but! This documentary showed the true nature of Al Franken as a potty mouthed extreme liberal. I could not stand the fact that he would put down those he was friendly with as soon as they would walk away. A really nasty individual and extreme waste of my time!",1302048000,2,446,4.658227848101266

Al Franken, you should use your clout to twist their arms.

Meanwhile, don't buy Docurama releases and vote thumbs down!",1228089600,2,322,4.944444444444445
8177420,1,B000NDIAP6,"This video makes Al Franken out to be a bumbling loser. His ""Liars"" book was great! What happened here? Does Al Franken really endorse this documentary? The producers have done him a major disservice!!!!",1201910400,,203,5.0
8177421,5,B000NDIAP6,"I chuckled through this entire documentary - which was simply a couple cameras following him around on his book tours, during the launch of Air America, at debates with Ann Coulter, and interspersed with archival footage of his Saturday Night Live days.  But beyond his comedic genius, is his concern for justice.  He not only defends the middle class, but the poor as well, from the endless propaganda of those who are serving power and privilege - Bush, Cheney, Rush, Sean Hannity, Neal Boortz and others.
I also appreciate his emotional honesty.  When he's angry, it's a righteous indignation.  And he doesn't mask his sorrow when speaking about the loss of his father, or facing the re-election of Bush in 2004.
Few people in politics or show business will let a camera into their lives during such vulnerable moments.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emotional-Intelligence-Why-It-Can-Matter-More-Than-IQ/dp/055338371X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</a>

But Al is indefatigable.  It seems as though he has an inner ""Stuart Smalley"" reassuring him that he is ""good enough, and smart enough, and that people like him.""
I like him, and I liked ""God Spoke"" a lot, and how it ended on the promising note of his campaign for Senate in Minnesota.  It would be great if he won, he could lighten things up a bit among all those corporate suits pretending to be the people's representatives.

If he doesn't win, he'll no doubt rebound with another book of truth and jokes, or another radio program, or any number of things that this dedicated public citizen can apply himself to.
In the meantime, I'm going to send him a donation for his current campaign.  It's the least I can do for all the laughs and all the insight he has provided me.",1192147200,,3141,6.369411764705882
8177422,4,B000NDIAP6,"As a big fan of Al Franken & Air America (I still listen every day), this was a great look into how he changed from simply a comedian to a real viable candidate for Senate. The end was sad, but then I cried for a week after the last presidential election & now we see the results. Truth needs to win out at least sometimes!! Personally, this proves that comedians would make GREAT government employees - Lewis Black for ANYTHING!!",1186185600,,430,4.3875
8177423,4,B000NDIAP6,"In my rating system, this should be  3 and 1/2, stars, but I gave it four because I think Franken is a necessary counterbalance to the propagandists he debunks. It's a bit shallow and feels more like an extended campaign ad for his (I hope successful) Senate bid.

The Buddy Hackett joke was the high point for me, but his deconstruction Brit Hume's lying abuse of statistics for some high-schoolers is a wonderful illustration of why an educated electorate is necessary for a functioning democracy.

A political aside: as a non-American, I have no trouble in recognizing that the invasion of Iraq is ""the supreme war crime"", as unprovoked wars of aggression were described by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, and am always amused and a little dismayed at how this fact is always outside the acceptable limits of opposition to the current Occupation, even among ""liberal"" Americans like Franken. Political expediency, I suppose.

Franken's fans will enjoy this light-weight documentary and get a few chuckles from it. It's a user-friendly introduction to the man for those who don't know him. People who don't understand the term ""oxymoron"", particularly as it applies to Fox News, will hate it and those looking for an in-depth examination of Franken's politics, the nature of his Senate run or the travails of Air America radio will find nothing of substance.",1179100800,4,1378,5.057268722466961
