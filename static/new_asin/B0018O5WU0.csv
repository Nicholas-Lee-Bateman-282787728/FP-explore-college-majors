3417851,5,B0018O5WU0,"Muhammad Ali: Made in Miami is a must-see for all Ali fans.  The great overarching sadness of the film is the viewer's knowledge that Ali - still among the living at a just-turned 70 - is treated and discussed in this film as having passed from this earthly realm.  And, indeed, the voluble, witty, intelligent, crackingly alive Ali seen in this vibrant pastiche is the polar opposite of the silent, reclusive, physically beset man of today.

If you're a student of Ali oeuvre like I am, you'll note that the material in this production hews closely to the ground covered in David Remnick's masterful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-of-the-World-Muhammad-Ali-and-the-Rise-of-an-American-Hero/dp/0375702296/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero</a>&nbsp;and photographer Flip Schulke's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Muhammad-Ali-The-Birth-of-a-Legend-Miami-1961-1964/dp/0312263600/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a Legend, Miami, 1961-1964</a>.

This 60-minute film could easily be six hours in length and no less fascinating, such is this man's rich early life.  Boiled down to an hour-long essence, the film traverses three parallel tracks: Ali's post-Olympics move to Miami (from his Louisville base) to train with Angelo Dundee at the city's famed 5th Street Gym (footage from those sessions of Ali's jawdropping foot- and hand-speed is mesmerizing); Ali's two fights with Sonny Liston (the production captures the fever pitch leading to the first fight that Remnick captures so brilliantly in his book); and Ali's flirtation with - and then fledgling allegiance to - the Nation of Islam (carried through to Ali's betrayal of Malcolm X...something he has rued for the rest of his life...Marable is superb at relating the story).  The three parts are skillfully interwoven and are equally compelling.",1327708800,4,2583,6.488372093023256

3417854,5,B0018O5WU0,"After the 1960 Summer Olympics, Cassius Clay was a heralded boxing gold medalist embarking on a professional career in Miami, Florida.

In February 1964, the sports world witnessed Clay's incredible victory in Miami Beach over feared champion Sonny Liston and the world witnessed the birth of an icon who transcended the ""sweet science,"" Muhammad Ali.

This PBS documentary chronicles an oftentimes overlooked period in the development of Clay the fighter and Ali the man during his years in the Fifth Avenue Gym and living in Miami's Overtown district, a thriving black community which carried the moniker, ""Harlem south.""

With special focus on legendary trainer Angelo Dundee and ""The Fight Doctor,"" Dr. Ferdie Pacheco, the development of the extraordinary talents is shown like never before. Interviews with Overtown residents, neighbors and media members provides great insight in the growing social and political awareness of an athlete who had special focus in using his athletic prowess for a greater good.

Ali biographer Thomas Hauser and journalist David Remnick utilize a historical context to bring many elements of this fascinating story together.

Before he became king, a foundation was set in Miami. The legend comes to life like never before in this brilliant documentary.",1218931200,8,1290,5.398009950248756

With fight footage and interviews this shows there were still racial situations and how he dealt with them. Shows him training and appearing on Jack Parr where he exhibits his rhymes.

Shows his almost stalker attention of Liston in an attempt to eventually get a fight in which he was an 8 to 1 underdog. Insightful. Also mentions matters of faith.",1466985600,,505,4.478260869565218

8270251,4,B0018O5WU0,"PBS ran this special on Cassius Clay (aka Muhammad Ali) in August, 2008.  The documentary chronicles the beginning boxing career of Cassius Clay, from 1960 to about 1967.  In order to fully understand Muhammad Ali, one must understand his beginnings (his roots) as Cassius Marcellus Clay, the vibrant boxing phenom that turned the staid boxing profession upside down and sideways.  This program pieces together numerous black and white film clips (and interviews with important people in Clay's life)to give a picture of the young, brassy, sassy, vibrant personality that was Cassius Clay.  I had seen many of the B/W film clips before, but there are some new ones as well, and the interviews with Angelo Dundee and the ""Fight Doctor"" Ferdie Pachecho add a lot of insight into the metamorphosis of the butterfly Clay.  Clay was a cultural phenomenon, interacting with foriegn dignitaries in Egypt, close friends with Malcolm X, hobnobbing with celebrities such as the Beatles, Sammy Davis, Sinatra, Johnny Carson, Dick Cavett, and many, many others.  Like a cultural magnet, anybody and everybody was drawn to Cassius as moths are to the flame.  Clay was hip, buzzing with life, spouting poetry, rebellious, driven, and very likable.  All of the attributes that made him famous and desirable are explored in this (approximate) 90 minute feature.  I have followed Ali/Clay my entire life, and there are some insights here that I did not know.

Program highlights include his relationship with Angelo Dundee, How he developed his persona, his two monumental and controversial fights with Sonny Liston, his association with the Nation of Islam, and his refusal to be inducted into the US Army.

For the boxing fan, who collects Ali memorabilia, this is probably a ""must"" video.  For the casual fan of Ali, this will reveeal some of what made him special - his ""roots"", so to speak.  I enjoyed the program and recommend it to others.
