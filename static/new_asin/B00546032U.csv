8456344,5,B00546032U,"If you love Canada, hockey, and mockumentaries like Spinal Tap, and I mean really loooooove, then you'll enjoy Puck Hogs. First, ignore the box ""art."" The image does not represent the film at all. It's the story of a recreational hockey team whose members have been playing together for years. The interactions between the characters are genuine yet just a shade on the parodic side. You'll probably enjoy it more if you ""get"" hockey, but I don't think a knowledge of the game is necessary to enjoy the dry sometimes absurd, always relatable humor. I will buy this one to put next to Spinal Tap, Best in Show, Bob Roberts, and What We Do in the Shadows. A worthy addition to the genre.",1508284800,,685,4.5772357723577235
8456345,2,B00546032U,"There is something so terrible about this movie, but also some things that are true.  Sad; the acting, action (aka game shots), story line, character background, and the list goes on.  True; the fact that benders tend to believe they are good at hockey and there are leagues where the hockey looks this bad.  This is at best a C- movie.  I will never watch this again and wish I hadn't wasted my time on it, so here I am trying to save you from making the same mistake.",1506470400,,469,4.235955056179775
8456346,1,B00546032U,"I don't know what this is. There doesn't seem to be enough hockey or comedy to call this a movie about either one. This movie is so bad I'm not even sure what to say. I like to leave impartial, informative reviews, but I can't think of anything good to say other than; I've seen worse. I wish I hadn't watched this.",1506211200,,315,4.096774193548387
8456347,5,B00546032U,"I thought it was a well made movie, I liked the characters and the acting was decent. I laughed a lot, which is the big indicator.",1505433600,,130,4.038461538461538
8456348,1,B00546032U,not worth watching. waste of time,1504310400,3,33,4.666666666666667

8456350,5,B00546032U,"Not a huge Hollywood movie here. Almost seems like a college student could have made this movie.
As a hockey player I find this movie hilarious.",1492646400,2,144,4.576923076923077
8456351,5,B00546032U,Funny. And it gets funnier the more you watch it. Should be more well-known.,1461369600,,76,4.5
8456352,5,B00546032U,Great little find for any hockey player or player of an adult league. It is titles like this that make me excited to browse Amazon for new movies.,1358553600,3,146,4.25
