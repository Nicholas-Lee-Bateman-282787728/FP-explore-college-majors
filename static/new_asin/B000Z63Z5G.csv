8234763,2,B000Z63Z5G,"E.C. Bentley's 1913 detection satire was filmed in the UK in 1920 and again in 1929, in Howard Hawks' disavowed late silent version. This humorlessly sober 1952 sound edition was financed by third-tier Republic Pictures--unexpectedly flush with profits from O'Hara and Wayne in THE QUIET MAN--and is significant only in that Orson Welles' fees (for what amounts to an embarrassingly hammy walk-on) went towards the completion of his filmed OTHELLO. His Arkadinesque character here has a prosthetic nose and a cute in-joke with the actor disparaging his own stage performance as the Moor (against Peter Finch's Iago) in London in 1951--this being the only Wellesian touch in a terribly leaden and plodding film.

It isn't Welles' show, and the glamour stars Lockwood (neither wicked nor conniving here) and Wilding (dapper but lightweight) battle against Herbert Wilcox' pedestrian and literal direction of the Bentley plotline, originally written as a satirical sendup of calcified whodunit conventions. The production is quite handsome but the pace is Wilcox-stodgy, needlessly talky and uncinematic, and this short film seems overlong even with its climactic Welles visitation and a feeble and silly dnouement. The fine Australian actor John McCallum gives by far the best performance here, memorable as Welles' confidential secretary and--you guessed it--Lockwood's paramour. The sole highlight is a gratuitous concert sequence with the glamourous Tasmanian pianist Eileen Joyce performing Mozart's K.491 concerto under Anthony Collins. Neither Joyce nor McCallum committed the murder but they quite outshine Lockwood, Wilding and Welles. All told, smart whodunit fanciers are best served by shunning the Trent films and reverting to Bentley's dated but more wittily irreverent prose original.

(On a roll with these name talents, and those windfall profits from Ford's Irish film, Republic's tobacco mogul Herbert Yates gamely financed two further Lockwood-Wilcox programmers: TROUBLE IN THE GLEN in glorious Trucolor and again roping in Messrs McCallum and Welles, plus a bizarre piece of Joseph Conrad exotica in genuine Technicolor, LAUGHING ANNE, where Lockwood's original songs are dubbed by the great Liverpool popster Lita Roza and Conrad himself--not channeled by Orson Welles--purportedly tells the South Seas story.)",1470355200,,2330,5.692528735632184
8234764,5,B000Z63Z5G,"I was unable to find this movie in Region 1 (USA) format, so decided to get a Region 2 (PAL) version so I could watch it. I changed the formatting on my Microsoft Media Center to Region 2, and it played just fine. Caveat: MMC will only allow you to change the format 3 times. As for the movie itself, it follows the classical detective story by E. C. Bentley very closely. I hate it when screenwriters think they are improving the work of authors such as Agatha Christie, by inserting ludicrous plot twists! Example: ""The Detective"" has Alec Guinness as Chesterton's sleuth, Father Brown, and the plot has NOTHING to do with the original story (The Blue Cross). The team that put Trent's Last Case together did well. Excellent movie, great actors - and the ending will be a huge surprise!",1292889600,8,788,4.556338028169014
