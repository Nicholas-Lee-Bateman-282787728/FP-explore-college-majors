So glad i have this, and i recommend it while it is yet available.  i love the cd ""Let England Shake,"" it deserves the accolades it garnered; and i listened to it (and her other work) often on long night drives, usually singing harmonies i made up.  i do like that these videos are different versions of the songs, and the encore, a 13th video of ""England,"" which is just pj.",1447632000,2,874,4.197604790419161

8476498,5,B005K6CEQ2,"If you're looking for some extended time with PJ Harvey, this isn't for you.

If you're looking for a cinematic interpretation of Let England Shake by a skilled film-maker, then this is for you.

Each song is introduced by a diverse variety of Britons reading some of the lyrics of the songs, some obviously for the first time.

It's followed by a brief, non-narrative film that would be better described as surrounding the songs than accompanying them. Imagistic, imaginative, and non-linear, but still linked.

Interspersed are segments of PJ singing each song, brief, and not always of a successful shot at it. They are very intimate, very much focused on her face, her mouth and her eyes.

And just too short, but they're meant to be. Let England Shake is about how some things can be so sadly short and others can seem so terribly long, yet with a timeless quality. Let England Shake is anchored in World War I, but with a long drifting chain toward today. And like the album, this film collection explores that drift.

There really are few, if any, people who remember World War I alive, and so we must follow that drifting chain through music and film to experience what we can and sense what we cannot.",1370390400,5,1210,4.657276995305164
8476499,5,B005K6CEQ2,My review can not possibly be fair because I love PJ Harvey. this is basically a visual version of her new album.,1349481600,4,113,4.181818181818182
8476500,4,B005K6CEQ2,"The music and videos are great.  They can easily be seen on youtube if you want to preview them.  The odd thing here is that, regardless of what this page claims, the sound is not 5.1.  It's just in stereo.  Also, the video is not anamorphic.  It's windowboxed.  Odd but true.
