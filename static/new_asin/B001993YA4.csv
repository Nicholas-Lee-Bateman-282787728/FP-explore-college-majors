3427208,3,B001993YA4,"Today in between planning for tomorrow's flying mission we ran up to get some supplies at WalMart and I noticed that there was a new BBC film, which I was excited about. I own every other BBC documentary that has come out since Blu Ray was invented. So this evening I got started watching the film and I thought to myself after the first few scenes that the last part looked really familiar, but didn't think much of it. I was again planning for a flight so I was only 50% paying attention. I think somewhere around twenty minutes into it I started watching closely because I noticed that the start of the Mountain Goat scene was straight from Life (another BBC film). Then the next scene on the Komodo Dragon was also from Life. To say I was disappointed was an understatement, if all of the scenes in the film are going to be from past films at least say that on the box. Additionally, Daniel Craig's voice just isn't as captivating as David Attenborough's. I would say if you are thinking about purchasing this and do not have the series Life you should get that instead. It has a lot more content, a better commentator, and tells a better overall story than this film with the same content. This film just seems to just from one animal to another without much of a flow to it at all.",1365638400,55,1287,4.366666666666666
3427209,5,B001993YA4,"I've been reviewing for Amazon for about nine years. I review hundreds of miscellaneous product items, but my main reviewing interests are in music CDs, video DVDs and a few non-fiction books. I get requests to review something, mostly books, about every other day. The problem is that 99% don't fit my personal interests. If the request does somehow fit, I will accept and review at no cost other than the copy needed to review. For those requests that don't fit my interests, I send a polite decline. About a month ago, I received a request from Vanessa Camarra, an Intern from BBC Home Entertainment, asking if I might review DVD titles which they had for the upcoming 2013 Earth Day. Well, the BBC and National Geographic turn out such interesting and educational DVDs, how could I possibly refuse? ""One Life"" arrived this afternoon and I set it aside for my late evening DVD watching.

The video package which I have has two discs. One is a DVD. The other is a Blu-Ray  disc. Well, that's interesting. I think that will probably be a thing of the future. It certainly worked well with me in that I only have a DVD and can't see the advantage of a blu-ray without upgrading my entire system, which I'm not about to do. So, okay, I watched the DVD disc. It was superb. It's hard to imagine an upgraded version. One thing really, really impressed me about this disc. The photography. It was superb. If you're considering mega-views or micro-views, the photography was just awesome! When you're watching this video just ask yourself, How did they ever do this? Then you might appreciate the photography on this disc. Please let me predict. This video will come into nominations for major photography awards. Trust me.

The rest of the production was of very high quality. Let me introduce one negative. The background sound on my DVD overwhelmed the narator so that I had trouble hearing it. Okay, that might be a problem with my viewing system. I have a  46-inch plasma TV (non-high definition) and I hook it up with a 100-watt-per-channel stereo system including two 12-inch woofers and an 80 watt powered sub woofer. The sound on  this disc can range from exceptional to awesome. However, in places the background sound on this DVD is too loud. It overwhelms the naration. I've tried listening through my headphones rather than the speakers, but the problem persists. The problem may  be in my system, I admit.

The DVD is quite interesting. It goes through all kinds of animal pairings and even a variety of plants. The emphasis is on reproduction and survival. I found the life forms to be very interesting. I've taught a course in fossils and the evolution of life on the university level for about 25 years and I was familiar with all of the types of life represented in this video. There were no surprises. However, I've never actually seen many of these types of life other than as pictures or drawings in textbooks and references. The photography of them in their natural habitat was most interesting. The message I get from the video is that there is only one life. It got started over four billion years ago. Whatever survived and however it survived comes down to us as the myriad of different life forms we can observe today. It's a fascinating thing to think about and well presented in  this video.

""One Life"" was quite excellent. However, to best appreciate the video, I would suggest that you go back and view the entire extras package. It adds much to the video. Enjoy yourself.

3427211,5,B001993YA4,"Since the middle part of the 70's, I can't remember a day that I did not come home from work, and at some point between then and going to sleep, since the early part of this year not unwind to my favorite television show OLTL. From Vicki to Dorian, Karen Wolek and Marco Dane. Tina and Cord, to Max and Gabreil. Never to forget Asa Buchanan and all his wives to all his family. I don't want to forget both actors who played Todd Manning, and his wives especially Blair & Tea. Except for the bad story writting during the eighties I believe it was when they had  Vicki up in space and the Buchana's back in the old west, OLTL has never let me down. I would give anything for this to me, one of televisions greatest shows to date, to move to DVD.  It would be so fantastic to be able to go back to it's root's in black & white, from 1968 to 2012, and relive it all over again. Since ABC can't get anything rite any longer, here's hoping that they will release this show and All My Children also to DVD.

3427263,5,B001993YA4,"Wow. This video gives an impression of the awesomeness of life more than other I can think of. To watch this you cannot but be inmpressed by the hand god must have had in the evolution/creation of life- however you think it came about. (Of course it never references that- it's purely observation, purely science :). It's just SOOOOO amazing.

There is the water buffalo/Komodo dragon scene, for those with kids or sensitivities, but the actual death occurrs off camera. The elephant scene mentioned in the Africa film I think is here, too, but no baby elephant dies here. The only actual mating I remember is with beetles. There is the courtship of humpback whales- something I've never seen before!  I think this is safe to show to my young boys. There is an ostrich being taken down by cheetahs but I think it's manageable. No blood/gore.

This film does jump subjects rapidly, but it's slow moving within each subject. Not too fast for kids I think, as far as movies go anyways.

Lastly I think it might be better had David Attenborough narrated, alas, but certainly the film is outstanding regardless. I can see from reviews how this one has repeats from others, but as a stand alone, (from someone who hasn't see ""Africa"" or "" life"") it's great!  I think this is a great one for adults and especially for children, in regards to fostering empathy, respect, commonality, etc with/for the life we share this planet with.",1408838400,,1424,4.7028112449799195

There is not a single new shot in it that I haven't seen before, it's just an abbreviated version of some of the scenes from the other documentaries. I felt very ripped off.

3427334,2,B001993YA4,"First - I am a lover of the BBC nature documentaries, owning Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Life, Frozen Planet, Human Planet and others.  The production values of the videos combined with their compelling content make them ""go-to"" sources on inspiration as a photographer and nature-lover.

When I saw ""one Life"" hit the shelves, I immediately put it on my list - the timing is right for a fresh series, and I am a Daniel Craig fan as well.  Sure winner, right?  Unfortunately, this is a straight repackage of previous Life and/or Planet Earth footage, and Daniel Craig can't do a thing to change that.  While we're at it, while it is certain Sir David Attenborough cannot go on forever in his role as world's most recognizable nature documentary voice-over, listening to Craig - obviously an accomplished actor - come up far short in appreciation for the story he is telling shows us all just how deeply Sir David is committed to his work.

Do not buy unless you simply have a curiosity for how much difference outstanding narration can make.",1388016000,11,1040,4.75

But, from the opening, the boys were won over, glued to the film. My 5-year old said, ""I want to pick this for my movie night!"" During the film, my wife and I kept looking at each other in amazement. It is not ideological or left-leaning (as I expected), yet it is deeply moving and unmistakably moral.

For those who have not watched ""Life"", you may enjoy this even more because it does contain some great footage of the wonderful animals that inhabit our planet. Even I, who have watched ""Life"" found this to be riveting viewing, I guess you just can't tire of the amazing footage which provides viewers an intimate glimpse into the lives of these creatures.

According to the jacket blurb, this was filmed over 3000 days and spanned each continent and habitat. The narration is by Daniel Craig, and though engaging enough, I prefer David Attenborough's voice-over narration, more out of familiarity I guess, though Craig's voice-over will probably help in sales.

The total running time is 85 minutes, and the Blu-Ray quality is just amazing with sharply defined images one would expect from a quality production. The Special Features are:
Director's Commentary
Behind the Scenes
Making of One Life
Interviews
Mike Gunton on One Life (which is only found on the Blu-Ray edition)

There are English subtitle options for the hearing-impaired, and also French and Spanish subtitle options.

Verdict - Those who already have BBC's ""Life"" may opt to skip this, but those who haven't may enjoy this truncated version (""Life"" runs 550 minutes) which could serve as a great appetizer before indulging in the longer series.",1367366400,5,1729,5.664092664092664
3427374,3,B001993YA4,"I own Life, Planet Earth, Human Planet, Africa, Baraka, Samsara, and many other tales of mother Earth. Unfortunately most of my ,somewhat, older series are on DVD. So I ordered One Life on BR for image Quality expecting may be a few extras. There is nothing new. What was a little sad is that they tried to stick too many sequences into one disk. The story jumps from animal to animal in Life, giving each maybe 5 mins (approximate). The fast pace doesn't allow for a connection between me and the subject to form and blossom.",1367193600,14,526,4.489583333333333
3427375,5,B001993YA4,"It is an 85 minute show about the life on Planet Earth.  Even though I have seen some of the footage in other TV specials I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The cinematography was spectacular and the examples of life and animal behavior on the planet were beautifully done.  The film explains that the Earth is a planet with over 5 million different species of life living on it.  We all share one planet, and one future.

The filming depicts how many types of life survive on the planet and why that species is successful.  It shows the predators and the prey and how they find food, mate, procreated their species and continue their life cycle.  It shows animals in love, happy and terrified for their lives.  The hierarchy of the animal's ranking system within their own clans and also the maternal or fatherly love that makes them protect their children and their territory.

Animals are smart and some clever ones even use tools to achieve their goals.  They are farmers and engineers, they work as teams, perhaps by the millions or alone.  Whether they are hunter or prey, predator and victim these creatures survive on skill and guile.  Many even have unique skills that help them survive.  They can be fast, agile, strong or smart, poisonous or skillful, have Intelligence, ingenuity, grace, or determination.  Many display courage and love.  Some even sacrifice their own lives to help the future generations to be born and survive.  Life begins with birth and they strive to be born, mate, procreate and survive. They care for the young and help to create the next generation.

Animals have the same desires as we do, not just to live but to foster new life.  If you love nature then this film is for you. Its scenes are spectacular and educational for all.  I recommend it to you.

I was supplied a sample of the DVD for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.",1367020800,,1892,4.658610271903323
3427376,5,B001993YA4,The video is amazingly detailed. In the beginning they have a poison dart frog which is said to be the size of a fingernail. It is zoomed in enough to catch it's nature and tadpoles in incredibly detail. The whole movie is great.,1366329600,,229,4.348837209302325
3427377,4,B001993YA4,"Every now and then BBC sends me some of their latest and greatest titles 'for review' - in other words, I don't pay for them but they don't pressure me to review their productions or to write 'good reviews' either, which is fair. In fact, I do appreciate them still sending me Blu and DVDs even after most of my prior commentary wasn't that appreciative.

Now, on One Life. Here's what my nine year old daughter who loved watching it had to say. Her own words, not edited by me in any way:
_____________________________________________________

One Life is very educational and interesting. It has exotic and beautiful animals such as, snow monkeys and the chameleon. It also showed how these animals took care of their young and how they found their mates. I think it is a wonderful movie for kids who love and are interested in these amazing creatures.
_____________________________________________________

I am not sure if the intent was to be a 'for kids' movie but the Blu edition looks strikingly beautiful and it's made to impress and 'wow' the viewer. All the animals shown are pretty and clean and they do heart-warming things such as court their prospective mates and take care of their young in ways that should make us think thoughts such as ""they're just like us"" or even ""they're just like us, only better"".

Seriously, One Life comes with great visual and it's pretty good at illustrating the idea that we, humans, we are not that far removed from our fellow living creatures. And, after watching One Life I probably lean more toward agreement myself.

For anyone who doesn't have the patience to watch the somewhat-similar multiple-episodes series or for anyone (children for example) who've haven't watched that many nature shows, One Life is a great thing to watch. To some of us it may leave us with some 'same old, same old' afterthoughts, probably because some of the visuals were cut from other BBC nature shows so they aren't One Life originals.

You get both the DVD and the Blu discs in one package. I haven't watched the DVD but the visual quality of the Blu release is beyond reproach. Oh, I'm supposed to note that the commentary is done through a famous actor's voice. Which is nice but within the context of a nature show doesn't really add a lot to its substance.",1366243200,,2295,4.7537688442211055
3427378,4,B001993YA4,"Daniel Craig narrates One Life which ""was filmed over 3000 days across every continent and in every habitat.""  This 2 disc set includes a Blu-ray copy with special features, a DVD with special features, and an Ultraviolet digital copy which expires on April 9, 2015. Both discs have closed captioning.

  I am a nature lover & sometimes surprise my friends when I make comments like...'Ants keep aphids for slaves & milk them.' So, naturally, I thoroughly enjoyed 'One Life'. From the Snow Monkey Queen & her dynasty being the only ones allowed to enjoy a 100 degree thermal spring (in the dead of winter - while the other Snow Monkeys looked on) to the Pebble toad that makes like a rock & falls down a mountainside to flee the toad eating tarantula. There's plenty to see in this 85 minute movie.  I find all this so very amazing. I began watching the DVD on my laptop, but decided I needed to take in all the beauty of this film so I watched the Blu-ray on our tv & I wasn't disappointed. One Life even provided me with another ant story to share with my friends...the grassland ants, with  pin sized brains, have become farmers, engineers & architects to feed their very, very large population.

In many scenes ultra high speed cameras were used to slow down the action. This camera lets you see what you would never see even if you were standing right in front of the action...and it is incredible. Other times underwater cameras were used, helicopters & cameras that sped up the action.

I know the Product Descripton says there are no special features...but there are several....Be sure to watch them...they are very interesting!

'One Life' reminded me that animals go through life stages just as we do...they grow up, find meals,  have children, deal with competition, etc.

I have one complaint. I couldn't get the sound loud enough when I watched the DVD on my laptop. However, it was fine when I watched it on my television.

I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes & was told this is the first time 'One Life' has been released on Blu-ray...so I assume that this movie was available as a DVD in the past.",1365811200,,2124,4.604774535809018
