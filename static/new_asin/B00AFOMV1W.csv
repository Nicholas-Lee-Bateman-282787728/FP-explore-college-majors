If you're serious about Arnis or the Filipino Martial Arts this will make a nice addition to your library (assuming you've got a working VCR, I suppose.) However, if you're looking for a flashy tape that will teach you some spiffy, exciting looking knife or stick moves to wow your friends, well, go elsewhere.

The author spends a lot of time on basics, such as different kinds of knives, swords, sticks and so on, and the pros and cons of each. He spends a lot of time on very basic movements, including stretching and standard striking. And he does so in detail and he does this in a way that I think is very good but I am sure many will not appreciate.

Perhaps it might be best to pick this review with a couple others stating that it sucks and is too basic and the reviewer knew everything in it. I don't believe them when they say that, but this is one of those tapes. It's aimed at a mature audience who appreciates basics and fundamentals and wants to get them down before moving on to the next tapes in the series.",1357344000,,1085,4.282926829268293
