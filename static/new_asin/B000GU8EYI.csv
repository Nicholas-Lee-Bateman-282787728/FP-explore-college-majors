8134651,5,B000GU8EYI,I ordered the DVD because my son went to Penn State and I have been there quite a few times for football games.  It was a really nice overview of the football experience and I especially enjoyed it because my son was in the DVD a couple of times (he had a great beer pong shot!!) and it will be a great keepsake for him!,1167868800,,320,3.923076923076923
