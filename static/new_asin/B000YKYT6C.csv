8233425,4,B000YKYT6C,"This is a great product from ""The Killer"" with many informations, interviews and biographical material. Should not be missed in any Jerry Lee Lewis collection.",1486166400,,159,5.4
8233426,5,B000YKYT6C,"Just for completist and collectors alike, this is a great material. It contains the full documental ""I Am What I Am"", and three discs filled with interviews and extras. A fifth disc contains rare performances of the Killer's best known songs and facts about him.",1329091200,,262,4.844444444444444
8233427,4,B000YKYT6C,"I enjoyed the overall content. However, I really wish the video would have contained more performance footage and also a longer interview with Dick Clark.",1292976000,,154,5.2
8233428,1,B000YKYT6C,"What a huge disappointment this DVD set is. 5 DVDs running three minutes short of 8 hours and all you get is talking heads, except for four ""never-before-seen"" song performances. Watch these and you see why its ""never-before"". Boring people talking about a great singer. If you want Jerry Lee, better to buy JLL - Killer piano or JLL - Greatest live performances of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or, even, buy Dennis Quaid as Jerry, in the movie Great Balls of Fire; at 108 minutes, you learn much of what needs to be known about Jerry with all his best songs, sung by Jerry himself. Don't tell me about JLL, show me.",1225756800,5,609,4.398230088495575
8233429,5,B000YKYT6C,"Everyone has a different opinion I suppose when it comes to the Killer, but if you're a serious fan of the man and his music, then you MUST have this video, as it is the most well-done film on his career up through 1988, when it was filmed.  It's heart-breaking at some points, as it tells of the deaths of his sons, and other family members, with testimony from band members and friends who were there with him when the bad news came.

  On the other hand, you'll thrill for his moments of glory when he was pronounced the King of Rock and Roll in London, Eng., prior to his fateful visit there with Myra in 1958.  Also, when he re-took the Country charts in 1968-77 with hit after hit.  There are great film clips from rare footage, some only seen here.  I've watched this video probably around 15 times, and I still enjoy seeing it every time!",1203724800,3,846,4.3164556962025316
8233430,1,B000YKYT6C,Unless you collect J.L.L merchandise pass on this. This has alot of dvd's but it's all just interviews. The 4 concert songs are awful and notworth wathing once. I was really dissapointed with this collection. I don't believe anyone wants to set around and listen to 4 plus hours of interviews inwhich they say the same thing over and over and over.,1202947200,7,348,4.629032258064516
