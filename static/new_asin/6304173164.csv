7863679,5,6304173164,"Betty Boop,""Boop oop a Doop!"" This girl was one naughty diva. But I liked her. The creators created her with a lot of sex appeal, and spunk. She was definitely created for the adult audience. These unique cartoon shorts were quite erotic in view, and should take the rate of PG. For the adults, who enjoy viewing Betty Boop cartoons, this one is a must own.",1029628800,4,357,4.424242424242424
7863680,4,6304173164,"The first few segments are outdated and interesting only from an historical perspective. Don't let this deter you. The rest of the segments are fabulous. The musical numbers really swing. With the animation you can ""see"" the music. The work here shows great development when compared to the earlier sequences. You will not see these on TV. Political correctness will prevent that. I do not believe any of what is shown is meant to be hurtful although some may interpret it that way.",997920000,5,482,4.819277108433735
7863681,5,6304173164,"With the state of animation today, and only a few mainstream successes that are actually any good (stand up and take a bow Simpsons) it is a pleasure to find a tape like this.
These truely unique cartoons, that stood out from the crowd even in the Thirties, are amoung the greatest and most unusual animation ever made. Each cartoon is such a bizarre stream of consciousness its sometimes breathtaking.
Worth the price just for the excellent Cab Calloway an Louis Armstrong performances and for Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle.
A major point about this series is the quality of the films. You really won't find any cartoons from the Thirties in better condition - these really sparkle!",994896000,8,678,4.803418803418803
7863682,4,6304173164,"These are the cartoons made before Betty had to raise her neckline and lower her hemline. While they've got nothing on ""South Park"", there is a terrific ""anything goes"" approach to them that's  infectious. Not until Bugs Bunny would cartoons be so liberated.
The best  of the bunch are the three featuring songs by Cab Calloway, especially  ""Snow White"", which is a lead contender for best cartoon of all  time.
Overall, the quality is excellent; many of the cartoons look brand  new. Unfortunately, the picture seems to be cropped heavily on the top.  Since these seem to be an old TV package, I don't know if a complete print  can be found, but I sure hope so.
The sound is good too, except on some  shorts featuring Rudy Vallee and Etherl Merman. But you won't care much,  because those shorts are the most forgettable.",957916800,14,822,4.652777777777778
