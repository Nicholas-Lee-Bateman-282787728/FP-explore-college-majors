8338097,3,B001RJ1Y7G," also was released with English titles of ""My Secret Admirer Is a Vampire"" and ""King Zombie""; the latter is obviously coolest, but in 2008 vampires were probably still more favored than zombies (Twilight was released that year, and The Walking Dead didn't air until 2010). The DVD cover photo is a spoof of what was splashed across the cover of another Hong Kong film with two of the same actresses,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-lingerie/dp/B001PBUGUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La lingerie</a>.

The campy awfulness is what makes this possibly worth watching if you're inclined towards kitsch. I stayed with it because watching vampire films is a requirement for me (when I come across one, I feel a burden to indulge... everyone has an Achilles heel!)

Plot: The protagonist Macy (J.J. Jia) is a fashion model who can see ghosts (there is a tenuous connection between ghosts and vampires here). Macy and a gaggle of models go to Tung Lung To (an island near Hong Kong) for a photo shoot. Problem is, a vampire has recently been awakened in Tung Lung To due to (what else?) a couple having sex in a graveyard. I'll let you figure out the rest. Worth mentioning is these vampires are actually what we might consider in the States as a hybrid of vampires and zombies... maybe the producers were hedging their bets. The Vampire King hops around; this sounds odd until you learn that other Chinese vampires also hop in Hong Kong cinema.

Actors: a couple of them seem to know the ropes, including the beautiful J.J. Jia (who does more than just stand around looking gorgeous) and her equally fetching compatriot Jo Kuk who plays the head of security on Tung Lung Island.

Production values: The Vampire Who Admires Me was proficiently shot and technically competent. The DVD transfer looks good.

I always like to note at least one thing from a vampire film not seen previously in others. In this one, it's a character who fends off a vampire by issuing something of a diarrhea fart into its face, causing the vampire to slither away in disgust. I don't know if that's funny, but it is at least novel for a vamp flick. You be the judge. I don't remember laughing until about 1:15 into the movie (that's 1 hour 15 minutes, not 1 minute 15 seconds).

Rules for vampires in The Vampire Who Admires Me.
- When you see a vampire: hold your breath, and the vampire will go away (I am totally not pulling your leg about this). After a bit it becomes clear this rule was introduced to increase the comedic value of some scenes.
- There are 2 ways to ""kill"" them: burn them to ashes, or stab a wooden sword thru their heart (okay, that's more like it).
- To repel them, black dog's blood has an effect similar to that of holy water in traditional vampire flicks. Problem is, you need to find a black dog first.

Favorite line: ""Ghosts are the same as humans. Just respect them and they won't harm you. I sometimes feel that humans are scarier than ghosts."" -- Macy

Special Features: ""The Making Of"" (no subtitles) and a music video based on the movie (pretty sure you need to be from Hong Kong to enjoy it).",1466899200,,3145,4.7349177330895795
