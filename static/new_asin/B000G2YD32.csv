8128828,4,B000G2YD32,"""Nueces para el Amor"" is no more and no less than the story of Alicia (Malena Solda) and Marcelo (Nicolas Pauls), a story that happens against the backdrop of Argentinian history. This excellent film is directed by Alberto Lecchi, and tells a touching story.

Alicia and Marcelo first met on a train in 1975, after the last concert of ""Suis Generis"" and just before the beginning of another dictatorship in Argentina. Their love story seemed impossible from the very beginning, as Alicia already had a boyfriend. Besides, Alicia and Marcelo were very different: she liked to read, to write, was politically active, and loved foreign movies, whereas he was just beginning to discover his place in the world. Despite that, they started a relationship that only ended because Alicia thought that her social work and political commitment didn't give her the right to be in love.

Their love story doesn't end there, though, because this couple will meet many more times, at different stages in their lives. They will be different, older, and maybe wiser. Unfortunately, there will always be something that doesn't allow Alicia (now played by Ariadna Gil) and Marcelo (now played by Gaston Pauls) to recognize that they are, after all, soulmates. But... will things change someday? And if so, why?

This film is more than a nice love story, as it somehow manages to weave together the story of a couple with that of a country, whilst allowing you to hear some great songs from Argentina that show what many people felt during the dark times of the Argentinian dictatorship. ""Nueces para el amor"" is an excellent film, that I think you will like, provided you speak Spanish. If you don't, just make sure you get hold of a dvd with subtitles in English.
