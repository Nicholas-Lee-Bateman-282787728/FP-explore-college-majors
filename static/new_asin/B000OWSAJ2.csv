8187080,5,B000OWSAJ2,"In this DVD we are taken on a step by step guide on how to make a simple katana. I say simple because there is no folding involved, just cut out and temper. But for someone with no blade making experience this offers a good place to start. For the folding technique then you need to look up Mike Loades of Weapon Masters. He is a great experimental Archeologist who has many published books and consults to his credit.
That said, this is a good way to get some experience, and as another reviewer mentioned, all the materials you will need are listed.",1382400000,,551,4.359223300970874
8187081,5,B000OWSAJ2,"Wally Hayes patiently explains how you can take a bar of steel and turn it into a katana. It's the only DVD of its kind and a must-have item for anyone interested in blades or knifemaking, even though this is actually more of a sword!",1284249600,2,234,4.222222222222222
8187082,5,B000OWSAJ2,"In this DVD, Master Bladesmith Wally Hayes will show you detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to make his tactical katana, which he sells for $2900 USD, using the bare minimum of tools, using stock-reduction (grinding) techniques. This katana is, as he puts it, 'a modern interpretation of a traditional Japanese sword.' That is, the methods he uses and the details of the sword and fittings are not traditional, but will produce a Japanese style sword that is very functional.
This DVD covers:
How to design the blade and cut it out.
How to grind the blade.
How to differentially heat treat the blade using Japanese clay-hardening techniques, and temper the blade.
How to straighten the blade after heat treating.
How to polish and etch the blade.
How to make and attach the guard.
How to do a semi-traditional handle wrapping.
How to make a non-traditional sheath.
Sharpening.

Minor criticisms:

At the beginning, Wally lists the materials that will actually go into the sword, but he does not list the tools you will need to work it. You will have to follow along and make a list if you don't have an equipped metal working shop.
Although he is mostly very thorough, he does leave out some minor details.
I found his instructions on designing the blade to be a little too brief.
He does not explain hot to sand the plunge line, which can be difficult to figure out for beginners.
He does not go into detail about how to fit the guard and washer onto the tang. Again, beginners may find this difficult to figure out.

Despite these minor criticisms, I found this to be a fantastic introduction to stock-reduction methods for making swords, suitable for an intermediate knifemaker.",1249171200,10,1689,4.817241379310345
