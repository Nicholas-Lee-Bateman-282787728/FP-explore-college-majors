8624146,3,B00GKOJY2U,"I was really looking forward to this film as I am a fan of The Bill Douglas Trilogy, which I gave five stars, but I am unfortunately only giving the film 3 stars.  Douglas's film is about the 'Tolpuddle Martyrs', six Dorset farm labourers who in 1834 were arrested and tried for forming a trade union and subsequently transported to Australia.  Comrades (1986) was to be Bill Douglas's last film, as he died of cancer in 1991.  I have listed the Pros and Cons of this film as I see them.
Pros:
1. Good subject material
2. Cinemaphotography is interesting and artistic
3. Nominated Golden Berlin Bear - Berlin Film Festival
4. Winner Sutherland Trophy - British Film Institute Awards
Cons (I only have one con, but it was a major con for me):
1. Long films generally do not bother me, nor do I need an action film to entertain me, however, this film was not well edited by Bill Douglas. It was like he could not let anything go, so it ends up being a 185 minute movie that really should not gone over 90 minutes, so I was just glad when it was over and felt the story would have had more impact if it was shorter as well.",1489708800,,1120,4.273584905660377
