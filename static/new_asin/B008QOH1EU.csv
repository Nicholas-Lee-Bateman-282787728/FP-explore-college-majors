5178428,1,B008QOH1EU,"The movie was made in the 50 and had the quality of most movies made at that time.  I found it boring and cut it off before then end.  Unless you want to watch a period piece of propganda, don't waste your time renting this one.",1371945600,5,228,3.9347826086956523
5178429,3,B008QOH1EU,A mediocre film that was obviously made as propaganda film on the way some women were treated at birthing factories for the Third Riech.  This tells the tales of what happened to some women who fell in love or couldn't tolerate their prositution servicing their opperate partners.. Worth watching once and only once.,1356134400,5,316,4.962264150943396

5178432,2,B008QOH1EU,This is not at all what I expected. It's in black and white and it's the story of the Nazi regime requiring young maidens to have babies for the regime as a way to grow the regime. Not a flesh movie.,1446422400,,199,3.8780487804878048
5178433,2,B008QOH1EU,this movie's misleading cover may lead you to believe there will be alot of sex in the movie.  There is practialy  none.  the movie does tell about the Nazi regime trying to breed a race of supermen.,1430352000,,199,4.324324324324325

5178448,3,B008QOH1EU,"A good story about a true subject during World War II.  The German government didn't care what damage they were causing even in their own population.  The super race wasn't and isn't what the human family wants, but love is and this movie showed what happened when love was not a factor.",1397001600,2,287,4.5

5178450,2,B008QOH1EU,This movie was not what I thought it would be. I was expecting something entirely different. But sometimes you take a chance,1391040000,,124,4.681818181818182
5178451,3,B008QOH1EU,"three copies of this African jungle farce ended up in my neighbor's malebox. I only ordered two. anyway, now my neighbor (who i espied rip open my package and laugh and point in the direction of my house) toddled over to tell me I'm not making good choices. I asked her how she knew that. she pointed at my brown wingtips and tube socks. I told her I've been gazing in her windows day and night, and sometimes i even stick my head in the door and snicker, and I fell off her extension ladder this morning watching her clip her tow nails. i dropped lots of hints on her about the harsh penalties of mail theft too but she just stood there moaning and licking her teeth. so I went ahead and sent my bitches over to shake her down. I never seen so much busch. Never did see the movie so I give the cover three stars.",1388880000,3,813,4.119496855345912
5178452,2,B008QOH1EU,"In posting this review I am, in part, re-submitting my previous review of this film based on another DVD version (of the SAME MOVIE!) entitled simply: ""Ordered To Love"" that has been previously released by both;  Something Weird Video AND Sinister Cinema video! SO - there's a lot of different options for where to purchase this flik - IF one should still wish to after reading a bit about its' content....

Noting that one reviewer termed the film ""utter rubbish"" made me smile - like, when you order a movie entitled ""Women Ordered To Love"" with a cover graphic of a jack booted Nazi looming over a cringing woman are you expecting Oscar quality fare?!? Most people buy this stuff because it IS 'utter rubbish' and they're hoping for some good transgressive action & imagery. It is in this area that '(Women) Ordered To Love' sorta falls flat and may be perceived as a big disappointment.

The movie 'looks' like it could be one of those deliciously nasty 'Love Camp 7' /'Caligula Reincarnated As Hitler' type flix full of gratuitous 'concentration camp' sex & violence BUT it actually presents a different sort of Nazi tale. The plot deals with a 'scientific' plan by the Nazi elite to produce a race of genetically pure Arians by controlled breeding amongst selected Germanic individuals. The film starts with a group of enthusiastic young German women who have been 'selected' to participate in the experiment and we follow them, and ultimately a similar gang of randy German soldiers who have been chosen to mate with them. Into the midst of this 'forced insemination action' is injected the story of a disenchanted Nazi officer who ends up at the 'breeding facility' and forms a clandestine relationship with one of the women there. While it may sound like there could be ample opportunity within this plot for some good T&A action - there is none! Even in 'classic' genre scenes such as the 'doctor examining the inmates' the girls clutch towels to their bosoms - in short, there is, amazingly, no nudity whatsoever in this movie and precious little sex of any kind. So what you have is actually sort of a 'thoughtful' Naziploitaion film (which is an oxymoron if ever there was one!) and I think this is why viewers may feel 'cheated' by this flick. Going in expecting some entertaining sleaze and finding a morality tale is disappointing.

This may be particularly annoying in that the write-up 'hype' on this DVD's box cover IS misleading!  It promises to deliver a plot full of lotsa transgressive depravity/nudity/sadistic nasty Nazi action - knowing full well that this flik really does not contain such.  On a general evaluation level this is a fairly decent film, but 'hot' it's not!  At best it might be considered an 'interesting' example from this particular sub-genre of exploitation movies.",1386028800,24,2810,4.866108786610878
5178453,4,B008QOH1EU,"Actually this is not a bad film. If you are looking for some cheap thrills look elsewhere. I believe the film makers tried to capture the hysteria and blind obedience to duty during Nazi Germany. They actually captured it visually here. Werner Klingler's direction captures this time and place along with Igor Oberberg's haunting cinematography. The script however, is sub-standard, even for this would be genre that the marketing people were trying to pigeonhole this film. Yet, as an obscure  historical WWII piece it works because of its curiosity factor. This film features Maria Perschy (633 SQUADRON).",1378684800,4,607,5.257731958762887
5178454,1,B008QOH1EU,All I can say that it lacks a true Nazis film with all it's exploitations that they did at that time in history.  Save your money.  No sex!  and barely no skin shown.,1378080000,9,166,3.9696969696969697

5178456,1,B008QOH1EU,This is an older movie.  No one is forced; they are doing their patriotic nazi duty.  No good skin either.  don't waste your time,1376697600,2,129,4.291666666666667
