7956985,5,B00005YRV7,I teach religions of the world and this is a great add to our lessons.,1430611200,,70,3.7333333333333334
7956986,5,B00005YRV7,"I remember watching these in my middle school class (world religions). It began a life-long study of mine, and i feel that i'm better for it. I'm glad i finally found these animations after all these years.",1424390400,,206,4.594594594594595
7956987,5,B00005YRV7,I wanted it to add to my reference collection also to increase my knowledge on the subject to Enhanced my collection,1355184000,,116,4.571428571428571
7956988,4,B00005YRV7,"I, myself, enjoyed the movie because I wanted to learn more about world religions. My kids were half and half on it. Because the movie tries to give you a little info on several religions it's pressed for time and some religious information is not introduced. So that left me confused on a couple of stories. Others stories are very thorough. Overall, I think its a good intro for children to grasp main ideas.",1267574400,,410,4.554054054054054
7956989,2,B00005YRV7,I bought the video intending to use it as a classroom presentation for our Sunday School.  After reviewing the video I determined it to be overly juvenile for our age group(60-80).  I passed it too the childrens class teacher hoping she would find it appropriate.,1212796800,,263,4.822222222222222
7956990,4,B00005YRV7,As a 7th grade world history teacher I try to pull from as many sources as possible.  As a supplement to other instructions these short stories help provide some background knowledge for my students.  I think it is definitely worth the money and could be great discussion starters.  The stories are appropriate for middle school students. The Confucius and Buddha stories are my favorite.,1160697600,7,388,5.03125
7956991,1,B00005YRV7,"This video is useless for children of all ages. I bought it to expose my kids to various religious traditions. For the younger kids, this video was much too abstract and ""artsy"" to have any meaning. For the older kids, it was too cute and deviod of real insight or information. A total waste.",1130025600,12,292,4.425925925925926
7956992,3,B00005YRV7,"I know, I deserve it for not reading carefully enough before purchasing, but I was so excited by the subject...

That being said, it isn't bad, but leaves out a lot of things. I happened already to know about Judaism and Christianity, so I could fill in what was missing or neglected, but this could be dangerous and unfulfilling if I was trying to learn about them without previous knowledge (as in Islam; I have to take the word of the storyteller of this video here). I know about Judaism and Christianity, so I could fill in myself what was lacking in the video.

This is good for children (I guess?) to teach them that different people worship in different ways, but to give a basic overview of world religions, I would not employ this as a teaching tool. It simply leaves out too many pieces of the puzzles for each of the religions.",1118188800,22,839,4.441558441558442
