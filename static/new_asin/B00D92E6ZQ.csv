8590750,3,B00D92E6ZQ,The dance moves are fun but the cardio section is way too short- about 1/2 of the other Richard Simmons DVDs I own such as Boogie Down the Pounds and Party Off The Pounds. I have to go through it  twice to get my routine work out.,1487462400,2,230,3.893617021276596

8590755,5,B00D92E6ZQ,"Workout has two components:  Cardio for about 30 minutes, then toning for about 10-13 minutes.  Very enjoyable DVD.",1452384000,3,115,5.333333333333333
8590756,4,B00D92E6ZQ,I enjoyed the workout but am upper beginner maybe low intermediate and I wanted a longer cardio section. the actual cardio is maybe 20 minutes - the warmup lasted approximately 5 min or so and included stretches - I prefer a warmup that's moving but at a slower easier pace then get right to the workout. with this one I felt like I was getting warmed up then had to stop and hold leg stretches. once the cardio started though it was FUN! I was able to catch on to the moves well enough to get my heart rate up and keep it there - was bummed when it ended and went to the stretching again. the toning was unremarkable - all standing and he didn't recommend a weight so I used 3 lb dumbells. I did feel it more the 2nd time through and next time may go up to 5 lbs or just do the cardio then do something else for toning. the music was great - Richard seemed more subdued than I remember from 20 something years ago -still encouraging and the background exercisers were the ones who modified up to higher impact while Richard kept it low impact. no way I'm doing jumping jacks but he kept low impact. adding the arms and some enthusiasm once you know the steps you can keep the heartrate up and 20 minutes is still a decent workout- a lot of my before work workouts are 15-20 minutes - bu this one is more like 30 for the entire cardio beginning with the warmup and ending with the cooldown  wish the menu would let me choose just the workout part but oh well....there's also a section on the menu to learn the steps  I watched for a bit but found I could learn them while doing the routine. fun and Richard is sentimental to me,1424736000,4,1627,4.161904761904762
8590757,5,B00D92E6ZQ,"As any other of Richard Simmons workouts this workout is really fun to do. He can make you forget that you are working out, and make you feel like you are having a party.",1397260800,,170,4.029411764705882
8590758,5,B00D92E6ZQ,"Richard Simmons is the best fitness guru, Since I was a little girl and I'm in my 40's. I love this savvy and smooth workout he keeps you at an beginner and intermediate pace. His cueing is very easy and simple, even the worst couch potato can do this workout. His inspires you to keep moving and it is very fun. I give Kudos to Richard Simmons for coming out with another great workout dvd in his 60's. Good job Richard.",1380067200,7,421,4.209876543209877
