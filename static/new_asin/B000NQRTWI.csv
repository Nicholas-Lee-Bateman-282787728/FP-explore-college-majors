Ok, I', not going to write a long winded review
on Nexus.  I'm just going to write something because
there isn't anything on Amazon and Nexus is incredible.

Nexus is a very mature, darkish Ultraman series with SERIOUS
character deveopment and a well-thought out storyline.
The actors took their roles seriously, the feel and look
of the series was excellent, and it was just hands-down the
best, most inspiring Ultra-series I've seen to date (despite my
great affection for MANY of the other Ultras).

The approact to Nexus was also novel in that Nexus creats a
meta-field (pocket dimension) in which to fight the 'space beasts'
I really appreciated this invention becuase in a real-life
scenerio any kaiju battle would cause serious death and damage -
even Ultraman would be considered a menace (even five minutes of
cosmic laser blasts and kaiju bodies hurling through buildings
would not have many people cheering).  Just fantastic writing
and acting overall.

At times haunting and frightening, Nexus was always
extremely well-paced and entertaining.  See this if
you haven't already!
