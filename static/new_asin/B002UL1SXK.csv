She talks about the 3 days she spent with an angel, after her entire family was murdered. A truly inspiring story. There's talk of soul groups coming in together to help erase large amounts of Karma, as an act of love. I loved the book ""The Shack"" and if you have read it and loved it like I did. I think you will also greatly enjoy this DVD. The production of this film is very well done. The message is beautiful. A great film all the way around. I highly recommend it.",1271980800,7,605,4.135593220338983
3991290,3,B002UL1SXK,"I cannot rate this DVD higher than three stars because I had a difficult time understanding much of what was spoken with the loud music background.  This difficulty was enhanced with those speaking with a foreign accent.  The graphics were wonderful, and perhaps with further viewing I will be able to hear more of what some people were saying.  The subject is fascinating and very worthwhile for anyone asking what happens to use when we die and how we should live our lives until then.",1271462400,20,487,4.705882352941177
3991291,5,B002UL1SXK,"I really liked this film.  Sometimes, I don't want a lot of science/pseudo science or what-have-you.  I just want to hear what it was like for those who have experienced death.  Just ""tell me how it felt for you"" .... that's all.  This has many anecdotes and it was refreshing and inspiring.  It's what I wanted and it's what I got in this film.  It's visually beautiful also.  I'm pleased .... and comforted.",1271376000,15,409,4.52054794520548
3991292,5,B002UL1SXK,"I know not many people can understand the full value of this dvd's message and presentation as it requires previous knowledge in these fields of in-depth understanding on the nature of life and so-called ""death"". But for those who have some background knowledge and experience in these vitally important areas of understanding, this dvd is pure gold and a genuine delight for it's contribution
of helping humanity come home to a fuller and more meaningful appreciation of the Truth behind the curtain of ignorance. After viewing it 3-4 times, I knew I had to send a copy to everyone close to me
and if I could afford it, would send it to everyone I know. Not just for the information but for that type of information capable of freeing the mind from the bonds of ignorance.
 I was prepared to recieve this information due to my 40+ years of study and research based on my original question,'What is the Truth about life?'. That simple question elicited a response from the heart of universe and has taken me on a journey of discovery that I would never have imagined possible( Wait what? There really is a God? Unconditional Love is the True Nature of everyone and everything and we are One with this Being of Light,in fact That's who we are? Really? Woha, most everyone then has it completely up-side-down!). This dvd helps bring you right-side-up! Buy it. Study it. Share it. Live it's teaching and message. You'll be the wiser and happier for it, without question!
Some helpful companion dvd's are ""Home & Back"" and ""Round Trip"". These support and compliment one another even though there made by different producers. Very important information is presented in each, the kind of information that releases all fear and sets up the foundation for a life lived with true purpose,true intention,true meaning, true value, true wisdom and true joy! No kidding. Enjoy your journey into the greatest journey of all, coming home to your own Self :  )",1266883200,57,1944,4.8
3991293,4,B002UL1SXK,"The ruling scientific paradigm with its naive belief in monistic materialism has ruled out any possibility of life after the demise of the body. But more adventurous, thoughtful individuals still have the courage to open up this question. Not based on wishful thinking and dreams but on experiences. Either spontaneous happenings or aided by entheogenics or meditation.

In this movie Jay Weidner has assembled a broad palete of viewpoints from some experts in the field. And spiced things up with some very aesthetic visuals and pleasing new age music to give a rather total experience. An experience that should leave no openminded viewer untouched.

We have three time near-death suvivor Dannon Brinkley, the hypnotherapist Brian Weiss, the buddhists Dzogchen Ponlop and Robert Thurman. But the main characters are Neale Donald Walsh and Renate Dollinger. The first talking about an out-of-body experience, the later about her meetings with an angel ('dressed' as a R.A.F.-officer!). And while both have interesting stories to tell, it might not be spirituality at its 'highest'.

And rather amazingly, Stan Grof - who might be considered the greatest (living) authority on the subject and whose books in this field ranks as classics - is only represented with two, very small clips. His&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Journey-Consciousness-and-the-Mystery-of-Death/dp/0966001990/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Journey: Consciousness and the Mystery of Death</a>may be the definitive work on this subject.

Despite this rather strange weighting of the evidence the movie none the less presents a challenging and inspiring panorama over views on the after-life. Ranging from rather rose-coloured fantasies to Alberto Villoldo's view that we only have a limited number of chances before we get annihilated forever into the matrix from where we came.

The view that might be missing is that of advanced forms of Eastern spirituality, that all this, even the notion of countless lifes and (re)incarnations, are only part of the dream of the One.",1265760000,15,2110,5.771704180064309
3991294,5,B002UL1SXK,"For anyone who is looking for answers in the great journey of life and the beyond this is the film to watch. I have had my mind expanded by many of the Sacred Mysteries films such as 2012 the Odyssey and Timewave 2013 so I was eager to see this new film Infinity;The Ultimate Trip.

This film is their best yet with insightful and heartfelt interviews with some of the leading scholars on the subject of death, the afterlife, reincarnation, interaction with angelic beings and more. Yet this is not your normal talking heads documentary. It is filled with beautiful visual imagery that enhances the subject matter and brings us in to the beauty of human experience.

I was particularly taken with Renate Dollinger, the eighty seven year old artist and holocaust survivor whose story about her interaction with an angelic being as well as personal experience of reincarnation is quite compelling. Stories from Dr. Alberto Villoldo, Neale Donald Walsch and Dannion Brinkley also bring the depth of personal experience to the film. Dannion is quite compelling , taking one beyond fear into the heart of his three near death experiences and what he has learned from them. Neale tells us that when you are no longer afraid of dying, you are no longer afraid of living. This is one of the main messages of the film, taking us  beyond our imprinted fears and thoughts of both death and life into an experience of our infinite nature.

The commentaries by experts such as Dr. Brian Weiss, Dr. Robert Thurman and Dr. Stanislav Grof also add a rich dimension to the film and give us a glimpse of this powerful subject from many different religious and cultural traditions. I highly recommend this film. It opens the heart and expands the mind.",1260230400,92,1733,4.766666666666667

I managed to make it all the way to its end. I thought about using it for meditations but no audio only.  I really do not recommend it if you are a sensitive person as I am.

Should you choose to explore this topic, I humbly suggest that you seek the underlying story behind all these stories. There will be some where entities visit us in real time. There will be some where multiple visits to the Other Side each result in a different adventure.

3991306,1,B002UL1SXK,"I know most of the speakers in this film.  Their collective attempt to convey information about a complex topic dealing with the afterlife, though appreciated, fails miserably.  What bothers me about this video, almost to a degree of torture, are the excessive and highly distractive fractals appearing in the visual montages when one member of the cast, Neal Donald Walsh, monotonously and unconvincingly expresses (in a whispy voice) his own belief in life after death of the physical body.  The fractals are not only very annoying, but have nothing to do with the subject matter of the film.  The movie is about a fascinating topic, but its message is poorly delivered and its credibility is significantly diminished.  In short, based on my own personal experience, I would not recommend this DVD to anyone, but would ask them to look elsewhere for information about possible immortality achieved through changes of states of existence.",1348617600,3,939,5.151315789473684
3991307,5,B002UL1SXK,This was a very interesting documentary. The people interviewed gave unique viewpoints and idea.

It's a slow but profound work for special interest groups, certainly not for mainstream Hollywood viewers. It features well known interviewees in a neutral space, without preaching or tensions.

If you are interested in expanding your consciousness, reflecting on death or the purpose of life, then this movie is for you. Grateful for this documentary.",1330992000,2,525,5.313253012048193

The content of the speakers was alright; my complaints have to do with the production.
The music that played nonstop through the entire presentation was TOO LOUD and I found it wore on my nerves after just a little time. It distracted from the speakers' words and many times I strained to make out what they were saying.  Visual montages especially the fractals though lovely were excessive - both hypnotic and overstimulating.
There also seemed to be little continuity running throughout the movie - was more of separate vignettes of individual teachers. The best parts were when they shared from their own personal experience, rather than giving teachings.
I congratulate the makers for their attempts to convey info on a complex topic, but I cannot recommend this dvd.",1330387200,4,972,4.884848484848485

3991311,1,B002UL1SXK,"A movie on Near Death Experiences and yet it's top ""star"" is Neale Donald Walsch. In the movie Neale starts off saying he was fighting/yelling at his wife and then went to take a nap and then had an 'out of body experience'. I mean come on! WHY would the producers of this film TRASH the contents by putting that rubbish into the movie? Neale just does it all doesn't he? Talks and jokes around with God in his head, has an out of body experience, knows the future....whatever!  The other notable star of this movie is Dannion Brinkley among other people who had a REAL NDE. These real stars are enjoyable to see, but you always back to Neale and listen to him as he speaks in his sweet soft whimpy ""spiritual"" voice, the others come off as ""normal"" people sharing their NDE experiences. The film maker though didn't really ""listen"" much to the people, one scene where Dannion Brinkley starts off his NDE, they show a wintery scene, this guy is from South Carolina and he had his NDE on a wet rainy day, I mean just utter nonsense! I'm not really sure what the intentions of this movie truly was? You have a few story's of NDE then Neale's ""dream"", along with helicopter like scenes of earth, accompanied with ""swishing"" and ""swooshing"" like sounds. Just a horrible made film, if you can delete out Neale, it would be much better from just that, but even then, the film is bad, let the people tell their story' without going back to this person than back to that person, blah blah. This film is nothing new, I'd recommend getting the 1995 film ""Saved by the Light"" or for the documentary get ""Life after Life"" an older 1990 film which is 10 times more better of film to watch and production wise. I originally gave this 3 stars, then 2, but really, I just cannot stomach to see this trash with Neale in it, just ruins ALL credibility. If they edit him out I'd give it 4 stars.",1324598400,12,1876,4.390804597701149
3991312,2,B002UL1SXK,I was really not impressed with this dvd. I do think there is a lot more written material that covers this most important subject better. I hoped for more from Mr Braden.

3991313,5,B002UL1SXK,"I always loved listening to Dannion Brinkley speak, and he is still awesome. But I also loved Renate, Neale and others in this wonderful DVD about the afterlife. Amazing and refreshing to watch, and aligned with my beliefs.",1320883200,2,223,4.894736842105263
3991314,2,B002UL1SXK,"Not bad but I was expecting more out of this video. Like more experiential / fact based stories. Too much of the video is spent with Neale Donald Walsch talking in his wispy, low, mumbling, rambling, ""spiritual"" voice. Of all the people in the video interviewed he was by far the least credible and least interesting. On the flip side very little time is spent with Brian Weiss who has decades of research into past life regressions and can speak more from a fact based / clinical perspective. The film spent too much time with the wrong people and very little time with the right people. BnB Beatles Depot.",1318723200,12,607,4.577981651376147
3991315,5,B002UL1SXK,"An especially well-compiled collection of interviews that recount out-of-body and afterlife experiences, visitations and communications that leave the viewer in wonder. They are recounted by some of the most respected and articulate writers and thinkers of today. The words of these messengers are intelligently woven together to give an amazing picture of what we are here for and how we evolve through the choices we make and consequences we experience. The narrative is complemented with luscious and even spectacular visual effects that help the viewer resonate with the feelings behind the words.

The messages conveyed are the real stars of this film. The good news is that we do not end, even when our bodies wear out. We are never alone, but have many helpers supporting our education and welfare. We are here to choose, learn, and evolve. We have all heard these messages in many forms, but here is a coherent and compelling presentation of them that will resonate at your very core.

In the end, it is all about removing fear, remembering our spiritual essence, living life to the fullest and creating your own destiny. As Dannion Brinkley says in the film, ""If you're not afraid, then you can't be controlled,"" and you can be a source of strength for others. And Neale Donald Walsch points out, ""When you're no longer afraid of dying, you're no longer afraid of living.""

Bravo, Jay Weidner and teachers. Well done!",1311984000,3,1426,4.958158995815899
3991316,4,B002UL1SXK,"I haven't died in this lifetime, so I can't comment on the accuracy of the information in the film, but based on what I've read, I felt it confirmed what others have reported occurs when we leave this plane.

I'm reminded of the beginning of ""The Reconnection"", by Dr. Eric Pearl, where he describes his mother's account of what she experienced: the beings she encountered, the way they communicated, the familiar souls, the beautiful colors and shapes, the bright radiating light, the life review, feeling the pain and joy she'd brought others, the absence of judgment, the feeling of having returned home. This film mentions all these things as what we should immediately look forward to upon returning to that divine place from which we came. Of course, the film is centered around reincarnation and I found the information, opinions and personal stories presented to be enlightening overall.

I found myself often pausing and replaying so that I could consider what was being presented and I appreciate when a film does that for me. It's something I'll likely watch again and share with others.

My only (minor) gripes:
I found the ""dazzling array"" of ""beautiful visual imagery"" to be a bit much. The water images and fractal graphics are very peaceful and quite stunning, but after more than a few moments I found myself looking for the person who was speaking. Also at times, I found the montages to be just horrible, as I find it uncomfortable looking at three or more overlapping images for more than a second or two and had to look away. I'd say I had to listen to this film for about 20 minutes because of this.

Finally, as this is certainly a spiritual film, if this was my production I would have edited or entirely removed the less-than-spiritual (and quite egocentric) comment made at some point by Dannion Brinkley where he says something to the effect of, ""... Whoever doesn't believe in life after death is stupid..."" I actually got a laugh at that, but it just seemed like an out of place comment.",1309564800,6,2016,4.751428571428572

Very artsy, but continuity suffers. The production values were poor: lighting was off, sound was terrible, and backgrounds appeared to have no thought put into them. The graphics were cheesy - I'd leave them out if I couldn't do them well. If you want to see a great production on a low budget, watch ""Something Unknown Is Doing We Don't Know What"". This should be the standard for low budget. Overall, ""Infinity"" had some good information about death and what we might expect, but the production itself is seriously flawed.",1299801600,2,670,4.834782608695652

I think the DVD was very well made, exspecially in accordance with my own beliefs.

A spiritual path is an individual one and each one must decide what is true for them, perhaps this DVD may help some one who is either dying, finding peace in death itself or knows someone who is dying and this may help you to help them threw the process.",1292457600,2,623,4.016129032258065

This movie helped broaden my perspective and see beyond my physical eyes. It helped me get beyond my grief and find peace with a knowing that all is well. The knowing is that this physical being that we are is temporary and that our spiritual self which is who we really are lives on.

The contribution Neale Donald Walsch made provided further validity to the themes presented. I have always enjoyed his work and respected his insights and wisdom. The interviews and the way they were conducted moved smoothly and let the story unfold. The cast was excellent and allowed the viewer to be one with them. You need to feel connected in this venue, since it is so emotional.

I am completely disappointed in this DVD. The format that this was filmed and edited in is beyond amateur. The opinion based ""journey"" equated to that of a story as told by a 10 year old.

To clarify, I am not one to discount any belief nor do I in this film. The topic here ""could"" have been shared in a MUCH better way. I wanted to be educated not mystified with swirls of color. I wanted to be spoke to not watch as those being interviewed searched the air for their next answer.
