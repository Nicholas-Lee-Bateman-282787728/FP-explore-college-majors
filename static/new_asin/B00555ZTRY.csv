4572340,3,B00555ZTRY,"Unfortunately, everyone is giving this video a bum rap.  However, it seems to me, it's very difficult to create the glossed over, perfect, paint brushed and contrived movies we're used to without a huge budget.  So, in this case, we find a show case of interesting writing rather than extravagant special effects and highly paid actors.  One thing I noticed is the completely different feel each story has.  It's almost like reading a New Yorker issue.  In a way, one must get themselves to perceive and be convinced of the situation because, there is so little time to create the, let's say, back drop or background.  The authors true voice is apparent, however.  That sort of thing must be created by the readers' or in this case viewers', imagination and only good writing can have that affect.  In a way, some of this movie does that.  In some ways, this has happened in the past.  If we were to look at the Matrix; we may find a great movie however ultimately, the Matrix is the result of multiple short stories (and I might add, they're not all that good, on their own).  So, in a way, perhaps,  I should state, one can only expect this to be an okay collection of original material, on average, with some true gems scattered throughout, much like that which one will find at their local play house.

That said, I thought it was good.  And if a person can't give, at least, three stars for Streets of Pain alone well, I suggest they merely wait for the next multimillion dollar block buster and just go watch that rather than waste any more time on small budget expose'.  Moreover, I'm sure all those big names signed up because they liked the stories and also, did precisely that to attract people to the small budget segment of entertainment; not as a device to trick people into doing something they don't want to do, as has been implied by previous posts.",1314403200,3,1865,4.541916167664671
4572341,1,B00555ZTRY,"Because I didn't read the reviews before Red Box conned me into renting this - I almost wasted 90+ minutes.  But, I happened to be in Amazon looking at other films and brought this one up prior to watching it.  Thank God!!!!  Not one review on the plus side!  So, I popped the DVD into the computer and scanned through it.  What garbage!  This is what somehow passes for film art.  There IS technical knowledge here - just used for nothing.

4572345,1,B00555ZTRY,"First off, I must say I have never reviewed any product on the internet. Ever.  I just have never had that much passion for or against anything.  Until now.  Redbox sent me a code for a free movie rental. Sweet!  I went to my friendly neighborhood Redbox in hopes of scoring tonight's entertainment.  I had never heard of American Breakdown, but when I saw the lengthy star-filled cast, I thought, ""can't go wrong."" It went wrong.  Very, very wrong. I'm not the type to turn a movie off mid-way through, I always give it a chance.  Not this one. I kept fast forwarding it to see if it got better. It had to right?  I made it as far as Paris Hilton and I was done.  I would love to give you a detailed description of why this movie was so horrible.  I can't.  I'm still having trouble wrapping my mind around what I just saw.  My brain is only able to utter out a few lackluster adjectives.  Grainy. Dizzy. Slow. Apocalyptic.  It wouldn't help to mention the actors in the movie either.  Names such as James Gandolfini, Scott Caan, and 'that funny guy from The Office,' only manage to lure you into a false sense of security.  Sure, actors make poor career choices all the time. But this many actors? All at once?  Couldn't happen. Not in my perfect world.

I do however have American Breakdown to thank for one thing.  It has managed to thrust me straight into the world of online reviews.  No longer will I sit ideally by and fall victim to poor craftsmanship.  My voice (albeit anonymously) shall be heard! For I have been wronged!  With my free coupon from Redbox, I paid exactly $0.00 to rent this movie.  I paid too much.",1314230400,104,1626,4.382550335570469

4572348,1,B00555ZTRY,"This movie is composed of several short stories made by different directors. The acting is mainly done by unknown actors that don't do a very good job. Every scene seems rushed liked they didn't care how well the actors hit their marks. The ""movie"" is so low budget that it looks like they filmed it on a camcorder and the video at times was almost undiscernable on my fifty inch plasma with upconversion bluray player.

Took us on a bit of the sci-fi route with the first set plot of the movie with the young street kid getting electrocuted while trying to get quarters out of a juke box and then the movie began to lose me. The movie actually picks up in the other plots and turns out ok, all in all I wasn't wowed by this film that was made up of many smaller films inside of it.

4572356,3,B00555ZTRY,"This DVD is a compilation of short films featuring Emmy winners Steve Carrell and James Gandolfini among other well known actors and Paris Hilton. This DVD doesn't have any extra features. The compilation features short films with a common theme of characters finding themselves. Most short films are done by new film directors from film school or emerging on the scene.

Don't expect brilliance here but just a different way of telling a story. In the first short film, ""Club Soda,"" stars Emmy winner James Gandolfini. It is about a young man and his conscience. The short is not the best film of the bunch but it is watchable. James Gandolfini displays his acting ability stretching from beyond his ""Soprano"" days. The role isn't a stretch but the film is worth watching just for his performance. He is a sorely missed actor today. He also produced the short film as well.

The second short film features Emmy winner Steve Carrell in ""Street of Pain"" about memory and dodgeball. This short film is done without any dialogue and also features Emmy winner actor Eric Stonestreet before ""Modern Family.""

The third short film entitled ""Member"" is about a group of young people driving in Los Angeles, California. I didn't get this short film of all. It is perhaps my least favorite in the bunch.

The fourth short film entitled ""Life Makes Sense If You're Famous"" is about life in Hollywood, California and about fame. I found it troublesome and confusing. There was too much going on in a short film.

The fifth short film entitled ""L.A. Knights"" stars Paris Hilton in a short about finding love and relationships in Los Angeles, California. She pretty much plays herself in the role. It is a forgettable short though but she tries to act.

The sixth and final short film is perhaps the best of the bunch about a young woman who fails at suicide and hates her job. Although filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, this short film feature Ioan Gruffudd in the role as a young man also on the verge of suicide. The story is the best for its simplicity and realism.

The DVD doesn't feature any extra features. If you're interested in seeing actors like Steve Carrell, James Gandolfini, Josh Hartnett, Paul Walker, Paris Hilton, and others in short films that are rarely available elsewhere, this DVD is perfect for you. This compilation of short films would be hard elsewhere.

This DVD compilation of short films might be ideal for film students to see how a variety of short films are done. The common theme here is about characters finding themselves in the world. My favorite short was the last and it was perfect.",1439683200,,2623,4.774834437086093

I had to go back and re-watch the part with him because it's so quick that you miss it. Even then, you figure that you'll just see him in another scene, but that ""other scene"" never comes.

It was so boring, that I couldn't wait to shut-it down, and I was totally surprised that there was nothing of interest or intrigue to keep my attention.

It was just rather strange and disconnected or maybe I was just sleepy. :-/

I don't know about the art of filmmaking so I can not comment other than to say that I did not like it at all. However, it will go into my Paul Walker collection of movies. RIP PW :-(",1408060800,2,491,3.91
4572362,4,B00555ZTRY,"American Breakdown is a fine cinematic work!
I can only speculate as why reviewers on Amazon trashed it!
They must have missed the point and misunderstood the film, or maybe they had trouble with the concept of Short Film, which is very popular outside the US.
The movie is a collection, an anthology rather, of short films. While one reviewer said it's disjointed, I saw the link clearly stated in the title!
It is a collage of snapshots into the different layers of the American society:
-The dreamers who drown in petty life, instead of reaching for the stars and their dreams..
-The bullies that we never outgrow, and that never grow up..
-The one-shot-at-fortune seekers, even if it means they risk it all, and that they confront their true aspirations at wealth even by fraud, and at love while they spew hatred, and even if every thing they do contradicts their their stated aim of being ""a useful member of society""
-The morally corrupt, who think they find ""fun"" in drugs and alcohol, and moral decadence, while their friend(s) find fun, even if in the form of one nightstand, just because they did not blind their senses, so they knew a good thing when they saw it, rather than mask their emotions and depression with superficial ""re-tox"".
-and the last piece (the best in my opinion), when the little things mean more to life than the stressors that strip the will for living from us everyday. ""In the end, we found a beginning"" is a memorable line with which the movie ends.

I think it is a safe bet to assume that I saw in the movie much good art and a profound message about what is gnawing at the heart of this country, while others didn't.

It was once said, that good art is always controversial.
Case in point, is this movie.

If you don't pay attention, you'll miss him, as it's too brief! The clip doesn't focus on Paul.

It was in my saved movies, so I went back to watch the remainder recently.  The few reviews that were on Hulu peaked my curiosity, since they all were warning away from the movie.  I figured, how bad can it be, so I continued watching. I painstakingly got through the first 3, skipped through the Paris segment and one other segment, then watched the last one.  I was trying to decipher what I had just seen, so went to the internet for an explanation.  That brought me here to the reviews, where I am adding my own two cents worth.  I still don't know what I just watched, but at least I feel I have a lot of company.

Lots of stars I love, and even about 4 folks from the Sopranos series.  It's everything most of the other reviews say... grainy (looks like the vignettes were filmed on a cheap camcorder), worse than what the average film student could come up with on their worst day, and even Jim Gandolfini and Steve Carell couldn't save it.  None of the vingnettes made any sense at all.  I actually made it through the whole thing (don't ask me how) but I ripped it out of the DVD player, cut the disc in half with garden shears, and threw it away.  Did anyone actually get paid to make this thing?  I have a headache, I think I'm going blind, and the only thing that could possibly redeem the world would be if no one is ever subjected to this thing again.

The ONLY redeeming quality is the final vignette.  This is surprisingly good and sentimental...or maybe it is just mediocre, but in comparison to the drivel you've been forced to watch up to that point, it seems amazing.  The idea of failing at suicide because your car won't start is actually a decent way to start the story.

They probably should have started with that, and then let the rest of the movie crash and burn.  As it is, probably only 3 people have actually watched that story, since watching the entire movie up until that point is an exercise in self-hate.

If, despite all the warnings you've been given here, you still think ""oh, how bad can it be??"" and decide to pick up the movie, once you realize you can't take anymore, fast forward to the last story and watch that.

We saw Steve Carell and other big names on the cover and wondered... had Steve Carell played a serious role in a movie we didn't even know existed? We are both big fans of Steve Carell and almost couldn't believe we had missed a movie he was in.

First of all, this isn't a conventional movie but a collection of ""shorts"" that play one after the other. Steve Carell is in ONE of these ""shorts"" called ""Street of Pain"" which is a little over 8 minutes long.

At least Steve Carell's short was good right? He's fun to watch! No, in fact, all the shorts are terrible. Steve Carell plays a game of dodge ball as an act of revenge against a couple of people who used to beat him down with rubber balls as a child. As he jumps around and does does cartwheels in the air his movements are so slow and painful to watch I'm fairly certain I could have seen the guide wires he was hanging on if I cared to go back and watch more closely. In the end Steve Carell's character loses the game of dodge ball and curls up in the fetal position sobbing.

4572387,1,B00555ZTRY,"It looked like one of those breakout movies where guys like Steve Carell play a serious role. Let me just ruin it for you now, Steve Carell does not play a cop, mobman, detective, or gangster. He literally plays dodgeball in the street for 6 minutes in this movie. What am I saying?!? this isn't even a movie. It's like 7 student shortfilms played back to back in a vomit filled horrible bad dream! I was tricked at my local Redbox into renting this. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this is. And I fast forwarded every 2 minutes! It's almost as bad as the Hands of Mannos. It's worse than most student films, and the A list actors only make it that much more evident. They have a terrible time with the poorly written scripts in each short. I cannot even comprehend the atrociousness that is this movie.",1316217600,,811,4.342105263157895
4572388,1,B00555ZTRY,"everyone's already said it. this is the worst movie ever made. made it through the whole thing by halfway watching it while online, but is this some kind of joke?  it made no sense.  all you people who say its ""deep"", thats because cognitive dissonance was trying to make you not feel like you were wasting your life by watching it and trying to help you justify the mistake.  believe me, i tried to do the same. especially during the trippy josh hartnett section, but what just happened? was that even a movie?  what was redbox thinking?  I have to think this was some kind of ""let's see how many people we can trick into watching this?"" kind of deal.  the paragraph at the end of the credits leaves me to think this as well.  don't rent this movie. or let anyone else rent it.  sadly i'll end up paying $3 for it....

when was it even filmed? other question....",1316131200,2,863,4.34375
4572389,1,B00555ZTRY,"I rented this movie from RedBox a few weeks back thinking, ""Hey, if it's got Steve Carrell and the guy from Sopranos, it can't be half bad.""  Boy was I ever disappointed!  This movie consists of 6 or 7 short stories that go absolutely NOWHERE!!!  This seems like some film student project gone awry!  Did I forget to mention this film was bad?!",1316044800,,344,4.412698412698413
4572390,1,B00555ZTRY,I will start off by saying I have never written a review before. I rented this from redbox and I wanted to read other reviews just to see if I was the only one who felt like I have been mentally violated .I have never not finished a movie until now. If you read these reviews you will be far more entertained. And to Marcus who also wrote a review I give you my vote. If I can stop one person from renting or buying this I will feel like I have done my part as a citizen. I have 1  idea that would be good to do with this movie. Give this movie to deathrow inmates force them to watch it and they will kill themselves! It would reduce taxes.,1315958400,,641,3.8931297709923665
4572391,3,B00555ZTRY,"""Instead of the end mabye we just found the beginning.""  A series of short movies that involve people looking for meaning in thier lives.  This is a movie filled with symbolism, most of it I am not smart enough to fully get.  Like ""Guilty Hearts"" this is a series of movies that have the same idea but are not connected.  Unlike ""Guilty Hearts"" this one is easy to watch.  There is really not much to review here as it is not a typical movie.  If you are into art-house like independent movies this is a great one to watch.  The cast and acting is great, the movie is OK, if you like this kind of thing.  Overall, not bad, but again this is the type of movie that only appeals to certain people.  I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I doubt it.

4572392,1,B00555ZTRY,"Ok, so I thought I could enjoy a movie with a cast like this... wrong. This movie was designed to provide karma to me for pirating it. This is the last time I ever copy a movie. You win FBI. Thanks for funding this horrible video to deter me. If you pay for this, you will regret it. If you do not pay for this.... you will regret it still. My TV even hates me now for playing this. I am going to go watch Brokeback Mountain to get this out of my mind.",1315699200,,452,3.8191489361702127
4572393,1,B00555ZTRY,"I was actually excited to watch this movie based on the plot description and the character list.. When it started I literally asked, ""Is this a joke?""

By far the worst movie ever made in the history of man-kind, or anything that came before it and anything after.

Please don't waste your money like I did.

This should have been called The Ring 3 because you will probably die after watching it.",1315612800,2,397,4.486111111111111

4572395,1,B00555ZTRY,"I rented the movie due to Steve Carell, Josh Hartnett, James Gandolfini, and Paul Walker being displayed on the cover... I can honestly say I have never been more let down and disappointed in a movie before in my entire life. It's a perfect example of how NOT to make a movie, and my respect for the actors in the movie just took a huge hit. If I had to choose between watching American Breakdown one more time and being tied to a chair forced to watch ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" for 48 hours straight I wouldn't hesitate for a second --- tie me down.",1315353600,,555,4.245283018867925
4572396,1,B00555ZTRY,"As other reviewers have mentioned, it is very rare that I will actually turn off a bad movie rather than watch any more of it.  American Breakdown was a movie I made an exception for.  I didn't even bother fast forwarding any further to see if it would get bettter, I just knew it wouldn't.  Every minute longer that I watched it made me feel like more of a sucker for getting taken by RedBox and the fraud they pull off with movies like this. Start-studded cast, glitzy cover and complete garbage under the covers.  I want to like you Red Box but this is beneath you.",1315180800,,568,4.280373831775701

I ended up spending 25$ on it... just so I could break it in half so no other human being would have to be subjected to such garbage.  I feel as if I should be nominated for a nobel peace prize for my services to humanity through my actions.  the worst thing about it is, I am 100% serious.  do not view this or your eyes may go blind.",1314921600,11,415,3.7906976744186047
4572400,1,B00555ZTRY,"ok, so after watching this in disbelief and pondering it for a couple days, I had an epiphany.  This is literally the only explanation for how this movie(s) was made.  Bear with me...  So my theory goes, a high-powered studio exec (producer type) had a son with terminal cancer or some other awful disease.  The kid was a lively kid who made people laugh on set, and was easy to get along with and non-threatening to movie stars.  Everyone loved this kid and felt terrible when they found out he had this terminal disease.  So one day in 2006 the high-powered studio exec went to a group of actors and let them know that his son's dying wish was to direct a movie based on a bunch of short stories he had written with his 7th grade tutor last year. He had a crush on Paris and how could Carrell, Walker, Gandolfino, Hartnett, etc say no?  They loved the kid - besides,it's not like this movie would go to the big screen.  It would simply cheer the kid up and he could stick in a DVD at his home-theatre or hospital bed.  Show it to a couple of buddies and say; ""look what I did!""  Then after the kid dies, the high-powered exec wife, whose life is all philanthopy and would love anything her son created, starts a memorial fund to benefit kids with this disease and release the movie so that any profits can go towards making life a little better for them and their families.

So, if this isn't the answer to how in the world this was made then my review is this...  Holy CRAP! That is literally the worst movie(s) ever created. And not in a wow this is so terrible it's funny kinda way, like The Room.  Not in an intentional kinda way that makes it a cult classic, like Starship Troopers.  Nope, just a complete waste of time.  No redeeming quality at all.  Acting is brutal, even by the stars, the stories are either pointless or annoying,the effects... actually the lightning in the first film is hilarious, the one highlight of the collection.  You would think that at least they are short, 10-15 minutes each, so at least they are over quick and you can see if the next one is any better, but no, each film is it's own little eternity of hell.  It's literally amazing how long 10 minutes can be.",1314921600,3,2200,4.337408312958435

4572402,1,B00555ZTRY,"I rented this movie from Redbox out of pure curiosity, and based on the cast, it looked like it could be alright

Easily the worst ""movie"" I have ever seen.  If I could give it negative stars, I would.  First off, it wasn't even a movie, it was 5 short stories (I turned it off after 2) that had no relation to each other whatsoever.  The movie quality was awful, the plot lines were attrocious.

I seriously can't believe they're trying to sell this for $25, most expensive coaster you'll ever have. What I can't get my head around, was how they got the top notch cast to do this? The only reason I rented it was the names, all did stuff in the past that I really liked, boy was I disappointed.

4572406,1,B00555ZTRY,"The six pieces of artsy-farsy garbage that comprise AMERICAN BREAKDOWN (aka ""Stories USA"") are collectively the absolute worst nonsense I've seen this year. I kept watching, expecting something interesting to happen, but was ultimately very disappointed. A bonus is the migraine this thing gave me.

It's noisy, it's ilogical, it's spastic, it's an exercise in total cinematic pretension. This picture also sets the record for the longest credit scroll of all time: EIGHT MINUTES.

Guess what? The emperor doesn't have any clothes, nor a raison d'tre.

Congratulations to all involved for actually scraping BENEATH the bottom of the cinematic barrel.

Avoid at all costs. You have been warned! (Hey REDBOX: I want my dollar back!)
