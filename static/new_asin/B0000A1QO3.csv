1901061,5,B0000A1QO3,This video is a perfect addition to my Holy Week teachings in my second grade classroom.  It's peaceful tone and heartfelt message were just what we needed before leaving school for Easter break.  Thank you!,1366243200,3,207,4.885714285714286
1901062,5,B0000A1QO3,"Great story,the kids at kids church all applauded! It helped them to see whatever their circumstances God could use them in important ways.",1359417600,3,139,5.086956521739131
1901063,5,B0000A1QO3,Very well done!  This story helps people put their lives in proper perspective.  It is also uplifting and inspiring.  A good story for the entire family.,1358380800,,153,4.8076923076923075
1901064,5,B0000A1QO3,Excellent video.  Well presented.  Sensitive to the young age most likely viewing this one.,1244332800,5,91,5.428571428571429
1901065,5,B0000A1QO3,This is an excellent DVD for teaching your children biblically based life values. I would recomend this for any parent who wants to inspire their children in their Christian walk. Children over 6 or 7 years of age might find this somewhat simplistic but well worth it for those in a lower age group. This is a DVD which will be kept in our collection and passed down to our children when they have kids of their own.,1239840000,,416,4.346153846153846
1901066,5,B0000A1QO3,"This Christian movie is very good. No it's not high spun, full of action, or even a long movie, but it's got it where it counts. It's got heart, love, and compassion. Buy this film for the kids it has an excellent message to share.",1227657600,3,231,4.155555555555556
1901067,1,B0000A1QO3,"I purchased this movie for our Sunday wee church (preschool age) kids to watch for Easter.  I absolutely love this story, and was anxious to show it to the kids in a ""multi-media"" format.

Unfortanately, this movie was a disapointment.  30 minutes to tell such a short story leads to a movie that is slow moving and boring.  I showed it to a group of 2nd and 3rd graders this past Sunday, and I don't think they'll forgive me for it any time soon.  They were bored silly, and therefore missed the entire point the movie made.  I know my own kindergarten daughter would not watch it because it's so slow moving.

I'm considering this purchase a flop and will hide the video in my office.",1204675200,5,686,4.396825396825397
1901068,5,B0000A1QO3,My 2 1/2 year old son quickly got the concept of the tales of each tree in this film. I was impressed when he came to me after his first viewing and told me about the olive tree (I think it was) that was made in to a manger for Baby Jesus! This is great for anyone who loves the book and would like to see it in movie form!,1198800000,6,323,3.6285714285714286
1901069,4,B0000A1QO3,This animated movie about Jesus's life is wonderful.  I showed it to 1st-3rd graders and they were captivated.  I would recommend this movie for all ages.,1178928000,8,154,4.884615384615385
1901070,5,B0000A1QO3,"This is a favorite for my children as well as myself.  We all love this DVD and the book that is by Catherine McCafferty.  Don't mistake it for the ""Tale of Three Trees"" which isn't as good.",1102204800,20,190,4.108108108108108

1901076,5,B0000A1QO3,"If you love the classic folktale, youll love the DVD. The Legend of the Three Trees is a sweet and simple retelling of a timeless story narrated by Hal Holbrook. Full color images come to life on the screen as we follow the Three Trees on their journeys through their dreams and disappointments. Each tree has high hopes of sailing the seas, holding treasure, or growing tall. But the Creator has different plans. As each story unfolds, we discover what true greatness looks like and that  the Three Trees are more special than they realize.

I really enjoyed this DVD. Its great for quiet time or as a companion to the book. My daughter always loves when she reads a book and is rewarded by watching a movie that goes along with it. Its sort of her special treat for reading independently. I feel like The Legend of the Three Trees doesnt really have an age limit because everyone can learn from this story. As Passover approaches, this tale is closer to my heart than ever. In remembering Him and what He did for us, The Legend of the Three Trees is one that can add that extra special touch to your scripture studies this month.

1901077,4,B0000A1QO3,"We watched The Legend of the Three Trees DVD and enjoyed the reminder that God has a special plan for each one of us. The video has beautiful artistry and the instrumental music is spectacular. The story might be lost on younger children, since Jesus is only mentioned in passing. The focus is on the way the trees dreamed of their futures, yet God had a different plan that worked toward a higher glory.  I received this DVD to review. The opinions shared here are 100% mine.",1397001600,,476,4.471264367816092
1901078,5,B0000A1QO3,Great aid for my young students to grasp a very important concept to help guide their future aspirations. I would recommend this movie as a teaching aid for youth Sunday schools.,1396915200,,178,4.774193548387097

7995440,5,B0000A1QO3,"Children ages 6 through 11 watched this DVD during a religious ed. class.  They loved it!  The length of the video was fine, and the message was clear.  Hal Holbrook's narration was clear and easy to follow.",1519257600,,207,4.54054054054054
7995441,5,B0000A1QO3,"I had never heard this legend before! Beautifully done and a great addition to any Christian family's video library. The message is simple: You may have dreams, but God has plans for you! This is an uplifting story with a teachable lesson within the text. Younger children, say 5 to 8 year olds will find the story charming. Older elementary children 9+ might be able to find the biblical truths, as well.",1496534400,,405,4.638888888888889
