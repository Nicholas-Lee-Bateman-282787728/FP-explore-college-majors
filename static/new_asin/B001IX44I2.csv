You can build a pretty good ""toolbox"" of techniques and tricks to tackle most songs that are thrown your way. I also really appreciate Ben's heart; he is a solid example of how an electric guitarist can glorify God and compliment a worship team (rather than overpower it).

As a worship leader, this has been a great resource both for my own playing and for my volunteers. It's helped equip their minds (and hearts) with the right tools for the job.

This is worth your time, for sure.",1326844800,,570,4.419047619047619
8311478,5,B001IX44I2,"I had been praying about finding some instruction on playing more interesting electric guitar parts in my local church worship band. I came across this and purchased it immediately. Each time I watch it, I find something new I can try to add to the electric guitar part. I wish they had an ""Electric Guitar 2"" to take this series further. I think some of the examples are a bit tricky to apply but it could be just me. For example he will play an electric guitar part from one of Paul Baloche's songs and it sounds awesome but it doesn't exactly show you what you can do to help apply this to other songs. I suppose just taking time to really learn the fretboard and the CAGED system will pay off over time. Overall its very helpful and useful!

Its an excellent DVD and I'd recommend it to anyone new to playing electric guitar in a worship band.",1312588800,,847,4.327044025157233
8311479,4,B001IX44I2,"There is particular style that modern worship music embodies.  The electric guitar plays a big part of in that style.  I am a volunteer worship leader at my church and just started getting into the electric guitar scene a couple of years ago.  I had a lot of questions that this DVD series answered for me.  Paul Baloche and Ben Gowell deal with the role of electric guitar in worship, where the heart of the player should be, what pedals to use, and basic music theory that is extremely helpful.  There is a downloadable .pdf file that is also really helpful.

It can be confusing and intimidating not knowing what to play beyond basic chords, but this DVD shows you simple and easy ways to play chords up and down the neck.  These techniques are used by most modern rock bands.  The electric guitar parts played by Hillsong United, Chris Tomlin, David Crowder, etc., follow and expand on  these basic techniques shown in this DVD.  I highly recommend this DVD for someone just getting into electric guitar in worship, or someone who is unsure about what role electric guitar should have in a worship setting.  These techniques can be applied to all styles of music.  I could see using this DVD to help train incoming guitar players in a worship band.

The only downside is the price.  It's pretty expensive for a DVD, but it contains a lot of valuable knowledge in a format that is easy to understand and follow.",1284249600,2,1414,4.581673306772909
