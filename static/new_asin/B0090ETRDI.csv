8533245,5,B0090ETRDI,"Love this DVD concert. There were fewer songs than I had anticipated as the DVD doesn't cover the entire concert. I've seen footage online of this same concert that had several other songs, including a cover of an American song that I like. Overall it was a really good DVD otherwise. I imagine their concerts are among the most entertaining and fun of all the artists performing these days.",1455753600,,391,4.681159420289855
