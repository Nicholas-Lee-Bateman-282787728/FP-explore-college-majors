5312084,2,B009B0L5D6,"Once again, documentary film makers made the decision to grossly mishandle vintage newsreel film by changing the original aspect ratio of the black and white film (4:3) into stretched pseudo widescreen (16:9), thereby distorting the video (the squashed face effect).  I saw this documentary twice on PBS and I would never buy this or any other DVD that's made so ineptly.

This one hour show is intercut throughout with contemporary talking head interviews and vintage newsreel film.  Apparently, some directors favor squashed faces for the black and white newsreel images so that the viewer's TV screen is completely filled up at all times to match the modern interviews, even if it distorts the former.  For the viewer, there's no way to correct this mishandling except by constantly hitting the ""picture size"" or ""aspect ratio"" button on the remote.  For me, the 1962 images are what's important, so I just left my TV on 4:3 to properly view them and put up with ""tall and skinny"" distortion of the modern interviews.

I don't know if it's just laziness, stupidity, or disrespect for history that causes some directors to use the squashed face technique.  Ken Burns never uses it in his wonderful films on PBS, such as the World War II film, The War.  I guess this mishandling is done because some directors fear that modern viewers might freak out if they don't see their 16:9 TVs completely filled up. Oh no! The whole screen isn't filled! I can't take it! Millions would commit suicide, bashing their heads through their TV screens!  Children would be forever scarred!  Drenched in the shame of it all, the sun, would refuse to rise again!

Of course, several solutions can be used: Either show the newsreel film in the proper, original aspect ration, 4:3, with black bars on the left and right (pillarboxed) or replace the black bars with some kind of color matte designed to fool the eye and fill up the screen but leave the newsreel film alone (like they do on vintage Antiques Roadshow episodes).  The latter technique softens any transitions between film shot in different eras; I barely notice the technique being used on the Roadshow.

A third, less valid technique can be used, that is, the zoom.  The newsreel film can be zoomed in to expand the image to 16:9 without distorting the aspect ratio, so it looks normal.  The drawbacks are that the top and bottom of every shot is cropped off, so maybe 20-30% of the image is lost, and graininess is increased. This technique was used on the Seinfeld episodes currently in syndication, all designed and shot originally in 4:3, but now shown in zoomed 16:9.  They look good, but sometimes characters heads or objects in Jerry's apartment like the coffee table get cut off (where's Kramer's high hair???!!!).

According to PBS.org, Cuban Missile Crisis:  Three Men Go To War was produced by John Murray of Crossing the Line Productions and co-directed by John Murray and Emer Reynolds.  Shame on them and a pox on both their houses!",1409529600,9,2991,4.829411764705882

5312088,5,B009B0L5D6,"I was aboard the Tin Can that had the VDS (Variable Depth Sonar) and tracked the sub that eventually surfaced after
many long hours.  At the time we did not know about the Nukes and not till years later did we all find that we were the
closest we could have been to WWIII. It was good to know that for the sake of a few cool heads I wouldn't be here to
talk about those days. The ships name was USS Borie (DD-704). I'm sure the folks back in Russia never knew also
but the ones who did were happier with the outcome.  Nukes...if we gotta have em, we better home we never use em.",1390780800,9,578,3.9741379310344827
