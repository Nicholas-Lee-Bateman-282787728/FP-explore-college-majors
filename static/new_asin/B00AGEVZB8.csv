5424298,5,B00AGEVZB8,A great movie by Karan Johar with 3 new stars. This movie is young and fresh and the story keeps moving (not like how some Bollywood movies can drag). There are a couple nice twists and the eye candy (for both men and women) is well worth it. A very pleasant suprise that's def worth a watch.,1357689600,6,292,4.140350877192983

5424301,4,B00AGEVZB8,"Good movie, but it kind of drags toward the middle and is a little long. The songs are good. It need a little more action and was a little prissy, but it overall a good story and the guys aren't too bad to look at either.",1397088000,,221,3.8260869565217392
5424302,2,B00AGEVZB8,"Karan Johar is an excellent director and producer, but this movie fell short for me.  The leads we're gorgeous, no doubt.  The movie lacked any real plot and the underlying message about homosexuality and the school's competition didn't fit in with the love triangle angle.  I wasn't impressed.  Also to be noted, none of the characters looked old enough to have aged 10 years as per the end of the story.  Sorry I bought this one.",1377561600,,431,4.618421052631579
5424303,4,B00AGEVZB8,"Good movie. Great songs. Varun great actor, great future. Siddharth and Alia very promising future too. The topic is good. not far from reality. Another good movie from Karan Johar. I like when movies are fun to watch and also they teach something",1373932800,,247,4.767441860465116
5424304,2,B00AGEVZB8,"Now you see here, this here is what's wrong with Indian Cinema these days... all the passion is gone... all the fun is gone... all the exciting stories are gone... Nowadays, you just get these young studs running around without their shirts and some girl in a miniskirt pranching to some song about gucci and armaani... zeesh! What fools do they take us for? Entertainment! Ha!

Oh course, my opening paragraph is meant to be a bit 'cynical', a spoof on what an old-timer might think. But they'd be more than halfway right.

While not a very bad movie, 'Student of the year' (One part ""Main Hoon Na"" two parts ""Jo Jeeta Wahi Sikander"", minus most of the heart and soul) does present a lot of what is wrong with Hindi cinema these days.

Siddarth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan are hardly enthralling as lead characters; though I wouldn't fully blame their acting - the script more or less asks them to strut about with wooden expressions, sometimes shrugging their shoulders and off-handedly saying 'Yes, I AM cool'.

Then there's Alia Bhatt. I realise she's a bit young and needs time to fine-tune her acting, or have some lessons, but her character completely lacked any emotion at all. She just blank-paper-faced read out her lines from beginning to end. Even worse was that song where pranced about in a mini-skirt (though, to be honest, she barely made the effort to 'prance') with some stupid song in the background going 'Gucci, Armaani ... etc'.

I think the worst scene was when what I assume was Boman Irani's son lets fly at the dean for creating the 'cruel' student of the year trophy. Irani Jnrs halfway-decent overacting was pitted against the complete stone-faced silence of the others, whose faces portrayed not a whit of emotion, either him annoying them or those who agree with him. I think Kayoze might have some acting ability, but since he doesn't look 'hot' then I doubt we'll see him much in Hindi cinema.

While this movie is visually stunning and there is enough juice in it to make it worth watching, just once mind you, it is hardly an impressive movie.

The best scene was a song called 'Disco Deewane', and usually I skip the songs in the Hindi movies but at least this song gets some excitement, some energy in the movie. Oh yes, blink or look elsewhere for a second you'd miss it: that was Kajol making a split-second special appearance, in 'Disco Deewane' - now there's a woman who can act!",1369699200,,2417,4.646370023419204

5424306,3,B00AGEVZB8,"Karan has put several movies into a mixer and created a feel good, no violence, no bad language, entertaining movie. It starts out like Three Idiots or Jane Tu where old friends are suddenly getting together. Then it morphs into a bit like Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar with class warfare between rich and scholars. But then they reconcile. A little bit of father-son conflict like so many movies. And of course the famous love triangle. I am a bit surprised at myself that I liked this movie.

It starts with friends getting together to correct something that went wrong when they were in high school (or was it college?). Karan tells the story through parallel flashbacks of four actors who have gathered in a hotel and are waiting for other friends to arrive. They also show a dying dean of their school. Flashbacks take us to how they met, it shows light competition among themselves, a fashionista playing with emotions of two classmates. It shows one rich kid who is shunned by his father first competing with, then being friend and then breaking away and then competing with an ambitious kid who eventually steals his girlfriend.

Rishi Kapur plays the role of the dean of the school. He also has a crush on the school's soccer coach. I think that was unnecessary and adds nothing to the film except costing it one star in my rating. But good to see our childhood chocolate hero still going. When I told my son about him being a hero, he had the same reaction as I had when my father told about Prem Nath being a hero in his hey days.

The competition for Student of the Year could not be more ridiculous. This fact doesn't seem to have been lost on Karan also who lets the likeable 'Sudo' comment about it during the award ceremony. At first they have an IQ test. Who believes in it now a days? I think Karan put it there just to show that he has not forgotten that all this is happening at an educational institute. For the second stage is made up of a treasure hunt which requires knowledge of movies made eons before any of the actors was even born. Final stage is a triathlon where boys and girls compete against each other. Experienced watchers of Bollywood movies can guess which two will be the finalists. I won't spoil it for you who wins. That is a bit of positive for this movie.

Movie is very entertaining. Alia Bhat is a fresh face who will dazzle the industry after today's heroins are gone. The song 'Radha' has very catchy tune.

Overall it is a pure masala movie. Watch it for entertainment. Don't try to tie loose ends because Karan hasn't done that either.",1364688000,2,2576,4.484008528784648

5424308,4,B00AGEVZB8,"I got this CD last week and haven't stopped playing it since.  Because every song on it is a hit and pleasing to the ears.  I gave it only four stars because they didn't include all of the tracks featured in the movie, just the major ones.  For the full tracks you have to text a number on the back of the disc.  I would rather have all of them included in the disc rather than get the rest from my cell phone, just my personal preference.  All in all, if you liked the film chances are you will enjoy this disc for a long time to come.",1362441600,3,536,3.925925925925926

8551347,5,B00AGEVZB8,"This Bollywood musical is a cute coming of age story, a love triangle between a rich boy, a poor boy and the richest, most beautiful and popular girl in school.  All against a backdrop of the 'Student of the Year contest' where students must prove their aptitude in the 3 A's Academics, Arts and Athletics.

Yeah,there's nothing too original in the story, but y'know it's well told with memorable characters, catchy songs and some good acting.  There are some refreshing twists, for once the rich boy is not a total ass, nor is the poor boy completely noble.  And some of the twists are a bit contrived, but all in all it's a great film and even bears re-watching.",1437436800,,664,4.554621848739496
