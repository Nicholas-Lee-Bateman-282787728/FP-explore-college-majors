3901968,5,B002BZLBDW,This is a great movie if you love Randolph Scott as I do. The picture quality was excellent. Would highly recommend this movie to a friend.,1362009600,2,139,4.384615384615385
3901969,2,B002BZLBDW,"In my opinion, a minor movie in Andr de Toth's career. However, one may note that the famous scene of bandits offering champagne and free brunch to the passengers of the stagecoach can be found in Carson City. If you're in the mood for a few reflections, you may also ruminate about how De Toth handles the theme of the double in this film : the Kincaid brothers, the double tunnel, etc.. A DVD zone completists. Only.",1322352000,4,418,4.441558441558442
3901970,5,B002BZLBDW,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""CARSON CITY"" (1952) (87 min/Color) -- Starring Randolph Scott, Lucille Norman, Raymond Massey, Richard Webb & James Millican.

Directed by Andr&eacute; De Toth

When a construction engineer known only as Silent Jeff Kincaid (Scott), commences building a railroad between Nevada's Carson City and Virginia City in the 1870s, he is met with hostility by the locals, who feel that where there are trains, there are bandits. And as expected, a criminal gang headed by A.J. 'Big' Jack Davis (Raymond Massey) begins drawing up plans to plunder Carson City. When Silent Jeff vows to get rid of the town's criminal element, the villains frame him on a murder charge.

Under appreciated and versatile actor Raymond Massey, delivers a nicely nuanced performance and devises a brilliant railroad heist. Both his performance and his scheme are well worth a view. It is definitely one of the cleverest railroad robbery schemes ever conceived in a Western, and it is filmed in a way that clearly depicts the various elements of the plan.

TV's Captain Midnight Richard Webb has a pivotal role.

Melodic score by composer David Buttolph gives this oater a first class treatment, with Andr&eacute; De Toth at the directors helm loaded with action and stunt co-coordinators.

If you're a Randolph Scott fans will be satisfied, this is one not to be missed.

3901971,5,B002BZLBDW,"I may be pushing my luck here,after the great Warner Archive movies, especially with Randolph Scott. However, one Scott, Warner,DeToth collaboration that has gone unnoticed is a great western called ""THE BOUNTY HUNTER"". It is also a good thriller with Scott looking for three men wanted for robbery and murder. He has a whole town suspicious of one another and a couple of them even end up killing one and other. It has the usual Scott action throughout all in glorious Warnercolor. Surely this must be released on Warner Archives soon. I think its Scott's best Warner western after Carson City.",1298592000,5,595,4.900990099009901
3901972,5,B002BZLBDW,"I, like many, first encountered Carson City in the early-60s, when WOR in NYC played it as its Million Dollar Movie.  That meant multiple, sequential viewings for young, impressionable minds like mine.

Carson City features a taut script, excellent characters (led by the very creepy Massey) and very good direction by de Toth, a real pro.  I think that Scott's portrayal of Kincaid probably served as a political blue print for many post-WWII suburban youngsters caught unawares in the cross-currents of the 60s.  It did for me.

A final note about the music here, created by the great David Buttolph.  Heroic, exciting and memorable, his score is the real star (or co-star) of this terrific flick.  It's great to have it back in circulation after all this time.",1252281600,19,763,4.9140625
3901973,5,B002BZLBDW,"CARSON CITY is one of the better Warner Bros./Randolph Scott collaborations from the 1950s. Scott is up against ""The Champagne Bandit,"" played marvelously by Raymond Massey. This is one of director Andre de Toth's better films, and quite enjoyable. Recommended.",1249862400,8,261,5.55

3901988,5,B002BZLBDW,"Great product!  Unfortunately, Amazon has proven to me that they do not care about their customers.  When I had an issue with a different product (Amazon's fault-defective product) I contacted Amazon and they refused to make it right.  After I emailed them (seven times!) I never once heard back from them.  What a TERRIBLE way to treat your customers!!!  Beware!  If you can, always try and buy items from the companies who make them directly...DO NOT go through Amazon.  They do not deserve the money when they disregard their customers so terribly!",1393632000,3,551,4.923913043478261

All items I ever received were perfect. Well I watched""CARSON CITY""& it kept breaking away during the last ten minutes of the movie. My mistake..not the buyers. Hopefully they will get in touch w/me so I can get a new copy. Wait to see. I was stiupid not to keep address..I don't remember....Oh well. Carson City..is a classic SCOTT..true western. Purchase it..BUT watch it first  before you throw away their address. I was so wrong. I do hope they will get back with me. Thakyou-Jack",1391040000,,644,4.495726495726496

as he is the leader of a gang and wants to see the stagecoach line run so as he can continue
his robberies. Well worth watching.",1378252800,2,420,4.197530864197531
