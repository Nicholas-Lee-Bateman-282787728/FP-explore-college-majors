8713527,5,B00WHZZ98Y,"Hibito is living his dream on the moon and loving every minute. Except the minutes he is about to encounter after a soon-to-occur disaster.

Hibito's moon arc is my favorite story in the series. The exciting stuff all takes place in this set, but the repercussions continue on until the end of the series. Hibito finally gets some attention and growth as a character.

Mutta also gets some excitement in this set as he starts his astronaut training! (Finally!) Perhaps to honor by Hibitos moon excitement, Muttas first training is a survival training, involving a long trek through the desert. New characters are introduced and Nitta gets some backstory.",1435190400,,654,4.990825688073395
