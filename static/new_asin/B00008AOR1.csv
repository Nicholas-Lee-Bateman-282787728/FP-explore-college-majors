7981037,5,B00008AOR1,"EXCELLENT!!!!!! This is my second copy of this really wonderful DVD. When they say ""American Tenors"" these young men were all born in the United States. They all have unique ""American personality styles"". When combined, they DELIVER a tremendous performance of ALL AMERICAN SONGS!

I have watched their performance many, many times and only wish that there would have been a second (and a third) follow-up DVD.

It is worth the price and much more in enjoyment.",1396742400,,461,4.974025974025974
7981038,5,B00008AOR1,"The American Tenors sing a very good musical selection on this DVD, recorded live at the Kodak Theatre (as known at the time) in Los Angeles, the same of the Oscars cerimony. It's a joy to hear classics like 'Somewhere"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"".",1376611200,,250,4.5777777777777775
7981039,5,B00008AOR1,Very good price. Saw them in concert and loved their music. Bought on line and saved about $10 to boot.,1358899200,,103,4.2
7981040,4,B00008AOR1,"These thre voices are so wonderful together and solo, especialy Daniel.  His voice is a gift from heaven and is a blessing to my ears.  I'd like to hear them in person, but have not found any listing.  Any time they or Daniel are in Texas,  I would like to go.",1348876800,,260,4.03921568627451
7981041,5,B00008AOR1,"No offense to the other two great singers on this album, but I'd like to talk about my best friend Nathan who is one of ""The American Tenors"" and continues to tour and promote this show.

I remember the buzz in the air when they filmed this at the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles and the place was standing room only. Critics who were there loved it. Just a few weeks after recording the dvd SONY CLASSICAL (their label) was getting huge marketing projects under way to make ""The American Tenors"" popular in the States. Unfortunately, all the gigs that were lined up-Jay Leno, The Today Show, and many others got scrapped because the US went to war with Iraq - literally THAT week. Ouch.

That was really too bad because there were some great songs here. The show was buried before it even got a chance because of the war. You might argue that it was buried because the singers were ""no names"", but let me tell you something, that's [...] There are some songs here that are REALLY GREAT, and the musical arrangments are extraordinary. Nathan's version of ""If I Loved YOU"" is the best recording of that song you will ever find. I challenge you to find one better.

Whether it be singing on stage at Carnegie Hall, performing on an aircraft carrier in New York Harbor, opening NASDAQ, or a Kareoke Bar in Kansas City, Nathan is a star. He may not be the guy in the headlines today in America, but he has fans in the thousands, and has enormous talent and he can sing any song...ANY SONG and make it sound amazing.

Do yourself a favor and spend the [...] to get this DVD. Or better yet, the [...] for a new copy. Then go visit Nathan Granner's website and find out what he's up to next. If you are lucky someday you may get to hear him sing in person, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.",1154563200,,1794,4.3462686567164175
7981042,2,B00008AOR1,"Why did you not include the tenors on the DVD ""Three MO Tenors"" in your list of tenors mentioned in this article?
None of the Tenors mentioned comes close to singing American Classics, from all venues of American music, as well as Standard Classical Tenor Fare as the, ""Three MO Tenors""!  But then, America nor the rest of the world knows that there are extremely GOOD, Black Tenors, that can give all the rest a run for their money.",1060905600,2,433,4.481012658227848
7981043,5,B00008AOR1,"Four separate times, I was chilled by the performance of the 3 amazing young men who have become The American Tenors. I found myself clapping after certain songs. Other songs, caused tears to be shed.
some of these songs remind us what it's like to be Americans and why our troops have been deployed overseas...Johnny Comes Marching Home is turned into a song of the times. The House I Live in is a strong American song that I've not heard, but Frank Sinatra first recorded it long ago. They also sing America and an extra on the DVD is God Bless American. Take these 3 classically trained voices singing songs arranged by Frank McNamara and you get MAJOR CHILLS!
Also included is Shenandoah...American's Danny Boy. WOW is all I can say. I stopped breathing during the performance of this song!
I loved CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN, AMAZING GRACE...oh my, IF I LOVED YOU and some fun West Side Story songs!
The extra parts of the DVD show a biography of each American Tenor that were great to show where they came from, what they believe and why they are now American Tenors. Frank McNamara is also included. He explains who he is and shows us how the American Tenors were first ""put together"" as we go to Warsaw, then Dublin, New York and finally, Hollywood for the television taping.
I play my DVD on my computer while I do my computer stuff! I play the CD in my car as I travel.
Folks, you will love this DVD!

7981044,5,B00008AOR1,"I first saw these three gentlemen on a KPBS special. I was channel surfing until I stopped on Daniel Montenegro's solo of ""Be My Love."" I greatly enjoy opera and crossover classical artists, so I am very familiar with this song. This is the best version of ""Be My Love,"" that I have ever heard, even better than Mario Lanza. The tenor showed amazing stage presence, and a wonderful strong voice.
The other songs in the DVD are just as good. These three tenors really do sound nice together because their voices blend in when they sing at the same time. It does not sound like the voices are competing with each other, unlike other tenor trios that I have heard.
I enjoyed hearing traditional American songs being sung by well trained classical artists. It gives the music a greater importance. I must admit that I was not too thrilled to see songs like ""Shanendoah"" or ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" on the track list because they are songs that most Americans know quite well, and may be bored of. But, I was very surprised when I heard them on this DVD. They really sounded beautiful. The American Tenors have added new life to these traditional American songs.
I was very impressed by the personalities of the three artists. Nathan Granner has a strong voice, and is really funny on stage. His love for the music really does show. Daniel Montenegro, as previously mentioned, has strong stage presence and seems to grab the audience when he sings. Marucio O'Reilly has a very high voice for a tenor, and seems like a great guy. I loved his Elvis like, dance spin!
I strongly recommend this  DVD.",1046908800,8,1600,4.614035087719298
7981045,5,B00008AOR1,"I was at the Kodak Theater the night when they filmed this, and I must say that the night was captured eloquently on DVD!  What I really liked about this show was that these three guys could not only sing, but the musical arrangement and song selection were breathtaking.  Mauricio O'Reilly and Daniel Montenegro did some really nice songs.  Nathan Granner?  WOW!  Where did this guy come from!  Now I'm a singer, and I must say his rendition of ""If I Loved You"" was amazing!  What I also liked was another song he did where the other two helped out, ""Shenandoa"".  It is a tune that is traditional and heart-wrenching.  This is a time when lots of people are missing their loved ones who are off in another country dealing with the threat of war, and this song hits home!
  All three tenors blend beautifully and they brought back some really great ""older"" Broadway tunes, too.  THIS SHOW DOES NOT BEAT YOU OVER THE HEAD with patriotic songs.  They went deep into American music and hand-picked a show that is a winner.  Check out the bonus song Nathan sings ""I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair"".  I know what you are thinking!  You may remember this as a hokie song, but believe me, you will never think of it the same way.  This guy just put that song back on the map!  Do yourself a favor.  Buy the DVD.",1046822400,14,1315,4.381742738589212
