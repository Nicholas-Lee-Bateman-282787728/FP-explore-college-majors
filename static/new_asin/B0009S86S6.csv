8066148,5,B0009S86S6,Excellent exercise video! Makes the repetitive nature of stationary cycle and rowing machine sessions go much faster.,1446595200,,117,5.9411764705882355
8066149,1,B0009S86S6,"These bike videos are amateur in nature. Looks like they put a dash cam in the car and just drove around. You get to be in traffic, and the editing is a joke.  Save your dollars.  Use you smart phone to make a bike video. That's what I think they used. I would give these negative five stars if that was part of the ratings.",1395273600,,324,3.9692307692307693
8066150,5,B0009S86S6,"What a fabulous ride!  This DVD is so good to cycle/spin/bike to that I look forward to waking up just so I can get on my bike for another ride through Death Valley.  Can't get enough!  It is hypnotizing to watch the outstanding scenery while you are spinning. I work out 3x's longer because of these DVDs. Utah, Sedona, Yosemite, California Coast, and Puerto Rico are also favorites.",1231804800,2,384,4.617647058823529
8066151,5,B0009S86S6,"What a great way to see Death Valley without actually having to pass out and fall off your bike!  ;)  Anyone who's ever driven through this beautiful landscape knows that it would be nearly impossible to bike through that heat, so this video was a fun way to pretend.  Nice work!",1173657600,4,279,4.431372549019608
