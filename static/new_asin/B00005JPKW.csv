1593976,4,B00005JPKW,"What made Dr. Lecter kill and eat his victims? A large portion of that enigmatic question is answered in this latest chapter of the Hannibal Lecter saga. I say ""latest"" because after viewing this, it is my fervent hope that it isn't the last . After the film, I found myself wondering what Thomas Harris and Dino DeLaurentis have in store for Lecter-The Psychiatrist years.

 This film captures the tenebrous tension of the original film Silence of the Lambs.

The musical score is comparable, the direction gripping. Gaspard Ulliel is compelling as the young, psychopathic and psychically damaged Hannibal Lecter.

There have been reviews which assert that once the puzzle is revealed , as to how Dr. Lecter became the serial killer notorious, then he is no longer ""scary"".

I offer that a wounded animal is far more dangerous than a sound one.

Thomas Harris' carefully sculpted character is still the unique and terrifying anti-hero he's always been. This aspect shows Lecter vulnerable. Come closer....closer please...

Lecter is a ""thinking person's criminal"" whom some suspect has a soul (albeit a dark one).

This film was an excellent homage to the making of the tormented beast/renaissance man/psychiatrist and the neophyte agent, innocent Clarice, who will later be Dr. Lecter's undoing.

One fact of interest: The real serial killer Andrei Chicatillo (from Russia) was notorious for biting and eating from his victims. It is well documented that he lost his brother during the revolution and the famines which ensued. His brother was eaten by renegade soldiers. Does knowing that make the specter of Mr. Chicatillo less menacing?",1171065600,4,1640,5.158490566037736
1593977,4,B00005JPKW,I reccommend you catch an early show just to see his portayal of Hannibal Lector. He was awesome.,1171065600,,97,4.444444444444445
1593978,2,B00005JPKW,"""Hannibal Rising"" gives us an account of the childhood through young adult years of Thomas Harris' notorious Dr. Hannibal Lecter. I won't synopsise the plot because several key events occur very early on in the movie - suffice it to say that the boy Lecter has his humanity removed by exposure to several inhuman characters, as well as the death of his family, during WWII Lithuania. Subsequently, the introverted and silent Lecter is taken in by his beautiful Japanese Aunt and, as the body count begins to multiply, Hannibal comes out of his shell and becomes more and more the character we remember from ""Silence of the Lambs"".

This isn't a great movie. Mind you, it's not a bad one, either, not at all - Gong Li and Rhys Ifans give solid supporting performances to Gaspard Ulliel's confident, dynamic reading of Lecter, and Peter Webber's direction, while neither memorable nor original, is at least competent. Production design is duly lush, and the script is also reasonably sound. But the overall feeling you're left with at the end of the picture is that of Yet Another Blockbuster, and nothing at all like a study of the twisted psyche of a cannibalistic murderer.

Possible Spolier Alert: Several of the elements of Hannibal's past are overblown and campy, not least the flashback scenes involving the Lithuanian militia and Lecter's sister Mischa. Far from a proposed sense of the inhuman, the bawdy antics of the group of soldiers recall Monty Python in a very undramatic way. There's nothing here we haven't seen before.

Similarly, the heritage of Hannibal's Japanese Aunt feels slightly overconvenient and tacked-on, when, for his first murder, Lecter ""borrows"" the Samurai mask of her ancestors, providing a visual link to the most terrifying image of Hopkins' Lecter. But since that wasn't a choice on the part of the Hopkins character, why use it here? Like much of the film (the Lara Croft-style leather & motorcycle antics of Gong Li, samurai training montages in post-WW II France, exploding barges that belong in James Bond, and so forth), this image rings false, and Gaspard Ulliel's essentially sound portrayal of the young Hannibal Lecter is overdressed and dumbed-down because of this.

On the other hand, if you haven't seen or read any of the other movies or novels in this series, this might be a good place to start: it's a lightweight, blockbustery sort of film, very flawed, but containing several decent elements of cast and production that save it from being a plain old bad movie. ""Hannibal Rising"" fails when it is played for cheap thrills - had the same movie been made with the same people and toned-down, it could have been a classic.

Take that as you will.",1171065600,43,2698,4.894967177242888
1593979,5,B00005JPKW,"""Hannibal Rising"" is one of the darkest, most heavy-handed films I've ever seen. Yet I absolutely loved it. Even I don't understand why: the circumstances of the plot are ugly, focusing on the deepest, most disturbed recesses of the mind; a majority of the characters are malicious, having little if any regard for humanity; the visuals are more than a little difficult to watch, with disturbing scenes of torture and murder. Such unpleasant material doesn't easily make for an engrossing experience. Nonetheless, I found myself utterly fascinated, unable to avert my eyes from the screen. This is an engaging, shocking, beautifully photographed story of how the quest for vengeance can turn a hurt soul into a monster.

Such a person is Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic criminal mastermind made famous by Anthony Hopkins in 1991's ""The Silence of the Lambs."" This new film chronicles Lecter's early descent into madness, beginning in 1944 with the deaths of his mother, father, and sister in war torn Lithuania (he was only a child then, no more than eight). While his parents were merely shot to death, his baby sister, Mischa (Helena Lia Tachovska), was targeted by a group of German soldiers using the Lecter family lodge as a hideout. Because of the lodge's remoteness, and because it's the dead of winter, the soldiers quickly discover that food is scarce. ""If we want to live,"" says Vladis Grutas (Rhys Ifans) as he savagely eats a puny rabbit, ""we must eat!"" That's when they all look over at the children, specifically at Mischa.

The story then flashes forward eight years. Lecter is now a teenager (Gespard Ulliel), living in an orphanage that was once his family's castle. How tragic: what was once his home is now strictly controlled housing for hundreds of young men. As one might expect, he's not exactly popular among the other boys, especially since he remains silent during the day and screams every night as he dreams of his sister's death. There's some clever manipulation at work here; his painful childhood almost forces us to feel sympathy for the young Hannibal Lecter, even though we know he will eventually become a murderous lunatic. Is he truly insane, like the previous films would lead you to believe, or is he the unfortunate result of humanity's cruelty?

No one can definitely answer those questions. All one can do is witness Lecter spiraling out of control, sinking further and further into the depths of hate. At some point, he promises his sister that he will find her murderers and make them pay. Such is the way with revenge: it clouds judgment, reason, and morality, and it leaves a void that cannot be filled, no matter what. Lecter fell victim to such a void as a child, which serves as his driving force for the rest of the film. He devises a plan to escape the orphanage. He then leaves for France and meets his Japanese aunt, Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li). They immediately bond despite his initial reluctance to speak. The bond is made stronger as he watches her pray to her ancestors; she bows in front of her father's samurai armor, seeking strength and courage.

We know Lecter is seeking the same thing, especially since an emotional eruption is fast approaching. It finally arrives when he brutally murders a butcher using Murasaki's samurai sword. The butcher was intentionally crafted to be a despicable man; not only did he debase Murasaki, he had also aided the German's in transporting and exterminating Jews during the war. I can't say I felt sorry for him, which I suppose was the intended effect. The scene also establishes Lecter as a cold, calculating psychopath, a personality that's rarely indicative of a sympathetic character. But keep in mind that his family was needlessly murdered; who wouldn't be emotionally scarred by such a dark turn of events? I continuously questioned how I was supposed to feel about this character, even after he enrolls in a prestigious medical school in Paris. His main task, interestingly enough, is preparing cadavers for examination and experimentation.

The story's morbidity increases dramatically as Lecter tracks down the German soldiers responsible for his sister's death. Unfortunately, executing his plan will not be as easy as he thought; hot on his trail is Inspector Popil (Dominic West), in charge of capturing and incarcerating war criminals. To some extent, he understands Lecter's pain. This is because he, too, lost family during the war. However, he's also a man of the law, and he refuses to let Lecter's vendetta against a group of soldiers slip through the cracks. The situation is also hard on Murasaki; her family was killed when Hiroshima was bombed. She finds herself torn between loving her nephew and desiring for inner peace.

But for Lecter, absolutely everything is clear-cut; all he has left is the need for revenge, something that can never be alleviated even after the wrongdoers are caught. Having his way with the German soldiers makes for some uncomfortable moments, especially since they involve methods of torture that are best left unmentioned. I suppose you can understand why some will be turned off by this movie; as I've already said, it's a dark, dark story of cruelty, obsession, and pain. Writing this review still hasn't helped me to understand why I enjoyed ""Hannibal Rising"" so much. Maybe it's because I have a deeper understanding of a previously unknown character. True, Hannibal Lecter would go on to do terrible things. Still, I no longer view him as a loathsome monster. I now view him as a pitiable monster, made evil because of a deplorable environment.",1170979200,75,5610,4.962765957446808
1593980,5,B00005JPKW,"Finally, again a thriller that has it all: suspense, style, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, great photography, first-class acting, and a very good soundtrack. This Hannibal edition is the perfect precursor to Silence of the Lambs. Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal Lecter is superb - you can't ask for more, ... an extremely talented actor.

The exotic touch comes through Gong Li who once again delivers an excellent performance just like in the recent Miami Vice picture. The incorporation of some minor japanese mysticism is also a nice touch and adds flavor to this superb thriller. The ambience and mood in this flick is very well captured and the select effective closeups are what good movies are made of.

Although there were only four people in the theatre we went to, fans of thrillers should go and see this film and they will thoroughly enjoy it. I watch a lot of films and usually I only like one or two each year, and Hannibal Rising is really movie making at its best in this genre. The story line is also very good and provides the perfect backdrop to the latter Hannibal Lecter as it all comes together now: the creation of a merciless monster/cannibalistic serial killer. Once released as DVD, this film is certainly a must for every DVD collection. Five stars all the way.",1170979200,4,1291,4.8108108108108105
1593981,5,B00005JPKW,I just went and saw this movie. This movie is awesome. It really portrays the events that gave him the fuel he needed to become what he is. The acting was very well done. The best part is that they didn't ruin the movie with special effects. To many horror movies these days depend on the use of blood to provide the effect they are hoping to accomplish with the audience. This is not the case in Hannibal Rising. They shot it old school which is what was called for since it took place long ago. The story is what really makes this movie. If you love this series you must rush and see this now. Like I said its basically tied with Silence of the lambs in my opinion. WELL DONE.,1170979200,20,678,4.143939393939394

And, the reason for his cannibalism?  He was a child when ww2 ended.  With mass starvation on the eastern front, he and his young sister were held hostage by some soldiers.  These soldiers ate his sister and made him drink some of the broth they made from her.

Hell, even the actor they hired to be young Hannibal looks exactly like what I thought he would look like and yes the answer to why is a bit of a loaded answer but in The Silence of the Lambs he briefly touches on the why.....(do you remember....besides the awful orchestra member the why) and in Hannibal Rising if your paying attention he explains the why to his Aunt.

It was a movie that was an attempt to explore the character of Hannibal Lecter in his origins and instead sort of just left a bad revenge/sob story behind it. The drive for the plot barely pushes it forward, the romance is forced at best, and the cultural cliches hurt. This movie seemed like it was made purely for whatever money it was going to pull into the box office. If you liked ""Taken"" but without the action and less actual emotion, this would be the movie for you. Wouldn't rent it again. Kind of sorry I did the first time.

1596321,5,B00005JPKW,"This movie brutally fleshes out the hellish backstory of Hannibal Lecter. I've read several reviews that lament how Thomas Harris took away the mystery of Hannibal's past by creating a prequel, but I find it a suitably exotic and bizarre history to produce a figure as enigmatic as Hannibal. We learn much about Hannibal's motivations, capabilities, aspirations, and the very formation of his personality. His desensitization to death came early, forced to witness atrocities at the end of WWII. Likewise, this is where he got his early exposure to cannibalism in severely traumatic circumstances involving his younger sister. His fascination and empathy for orphans like Clarice Starling and those like Will Graham who take in strays, as well as his compassion for Margot Verger in the book ""Hannibal,"" all stem from these childhood experiences. His disdain for the rude comes from time spent with his uncle Robert and aunt, Lady Murasaki. In particular, Lady Murasaki's experiences with bigotry cross with Hannibal's protective nature and the cold brutality fostered by his traumatic childhood, giving rise to his first murder. As his adolescence plays out, he manages to track down each and every rogue soldier who participated in killing and eating his sister and delivering his unique form of justice, which develops into increasingly poetic expressions akin to the tableaux found in Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. While some may rue Thomas Harris shining a light on the monster, I appreciate these additions to Hannibal's lore. Compared to the backstories of his movie-villain comtemporaries like Jason and Freddy, ""Hannibal Rising"" is more intricate, more complex, and more captivating. Much like Hannibal himself.",1425427200,,1727,5.352941176470588

1596447,5,B00005JPKW,"I have read the book and have seen the movie (both many times), and I can tell you that the producers followed the story of Hannibal Lecter's origins written by Thomas Harris very closely.  Mucho kudos for that.  It IS a very dark film, but we're dealing with very dark subjects here -- most notably the evolution of a young, traumatized boy into a serial killer.

I was very pleasantly surprised by how well the actors played their parts.  I thought it next to impossible to capture the essence of a young Hannibal Lecter until I saw Gaspard Ulliel.  He studied Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal as an adult, and it paid off in spades.  He NAILED it.  They couldn't have chosen anyone better to play Lady Murasaki than Gong Li.  She ranges through a complexity of emotions with young Hannibal (compassion, fear, responsibility/mentorship, protectiveness, love, and heartbreak) and does so seamlessly.  Rhys Ifans, who plays Vladis Grutas, is picture-perfect as the cannibal, war criminal, and villain you love to hate.  He establishes himself as the ruthless alpha-dog who can be coldly controlled one moment and committing the most dastardly deeds the next.  Rounding out the leading cast is the relentless, no-nonsense Inspector Popil, played by Dominic West.  His attempt to establish a rapport with Hannibal based on his own past -- and Hannibal's careful targeting/mocking of his efforts, creates some excellent dramatic tension, as does the Inspector's attempts to rattle Lady Murasaki (and is he attracted to her?)

The location shooting and set pieces were excellent (as was the cinematography), the movie moved along at a good pace, and the music was beautifully eerie -- with the counterpoint of a German children's song that was at one point used to lure Hannibal's young sister, then twisted into a psychedelic funeral dirge, and finally used as a bit of comedy after Hannibal exacts vengeance on the last of his ""enemies.""  Definitely better than ""Hannibal,"" which sacrificed much of the story written by Thomas Harris, and by orders of magnitude better than ""Red Dragon,"" which was largely an afterthought that lacked the tension of ""Manhunter,"" the first film based on the book Red Dragon.  To understand the origins of evil, you must first go back to the beginning...",1410739200,,2289,5.0344827586206895

The studio/producers that owned the franchise was going to make it with or without him- so he wrote it. I'm glad he wrote the book as well as the screenplay. It kept the same feel as the previous movies (that take place after this story). It was well acted, you can see definite glimpses of the older Hannibal we all know and 'love'. I enjoyed finding out why Hannibal became the way he is later in life. It is worth seeing if only for that. However, there are other reasons: the cinamatography is beautiful and it captures the character so well. It is tastefully done, there is violence (how can there not be when telling the story of a psychopathic cannibal), but it is not gratuitous; it leaves some to the imagination.

1596820,4,B00005JPKW,"If this were an individual revenge themed movie that had nothing to do with Hannibal Lecter, then chances are, this would have been more well received among critics. However, as a prequel to the series based on the book of the same name about how Hannibal Lecter became the killer he is known as, this displeased many people; especially Hannibal fans. As a Hannibal fan myself, I agree that the portrayal of him in this film as a good guy who developed a blood lust out of justice and revenge due to experiencing a horribly traumatic event in childhood is inconsistent with his known identity as a sociopath since sociopathy is a trait one is born with and exhibits traits of this in childhood which he clearly did not in this movie. As a result, I can understand why many people did not like this movie.

  I however, still liked this movie despite it. Why? Because while viewing this movie, I decided to temporarily forget everything I know about Dr. Lecter so I could judge it more on its individual merits. As an individual movie, it's actually great in its own right. The pacing is rather slow at times, but it picks up at just the right moments. The camera work is great, Gaspard does a terrific job in his role as young Hannibal (in regards to the way he was written in the prequel), and as a vengeance themed story rooted in a traumatic childhood experience, the story itself is wonderfully compelling. My final thoughts? If you are watching this in order to obtain a fitting explanation as to how Hannibal became the killer that he is known as, you will be immensely dissatisfied with this film as the way he is portrayed here is inconsistent with Hannibal Lecter's known identity. However, if you are watching this in order to see a compelling revenge story set in the WWII era about a good guy who wants vengeance for the death of his parents and his sister who was killed and eaten alive by the nazis and a realistic portrayal of the impact trauma can have on a person, then this film just might be for you.",1401580800,,2019,4.4959128065395095

In the Anthony Hopkins movies as well as the somewhat new TV series the character ""Hannibal Lector"" is portrayed as an extremely complex intelligent psychopath. But in this movie, Hannibal is dumbed down what basically amounts to a slasher film baddie. Hannibal Rising attempts to explain his past, and why Hannibal ""is the way he is"". And in doing so it completely undermines the Hannibal I had grown to know, love and fear.

The film attempts to have the viewer sympathize with Hannibal by showing you the unfortunate circumstances that led him to essentially being the slasher portrayed in this film. The plot is simple, Hannibal has to watch as a group of men kill and eat his little sister after they are all driven into starvation during a harsh winter in eastern Europe. This supposedly causes Hannibal to become a sociopathic killer, who later in life vows revenge on each of the men that supped on his little sister.

He is taken in by his distant aunt of Japanese descent who enlightens him on the ways of the Samurai which is apparently what finally unlocks Hannibal's slasher tendencies. Which makes no sense. He then goes from one to the other killing the men off.

This makes for an extremely weak plot for any movie as well as one that has been done before, many times. This is why I particularly dislike this movie considering its supposed to be a prequel to the Anthony Hopkins films (as far as I understand it).

The acting is terrible and the story is full of gimmicks, including the use of the samurai mask as a kind of ""foreshadowing"" for the mask Hannibal wears in the other films. That mask was put on Hannibal to keep him from using his teeth and biting people, which he did a number of times, not because he liked it as a fashion statement.

Sorry if you've read this far and noticed how somewhat disjointed this review is. There was just way to much wrong with this movie and its hard for me to quantify it all without watching it again. From big things like the mask to little things like when the Japanese aunt rides around on her ""sportbike"" like the writers just wanted to ignore the fact that this was supposedly in the 1950's. And since I don't want to put myself through that again I'll just end it here. If you liked the Anthony Hopkins take on Hannibal and the amazing acting in those movies I HIGHLY recommend checking out the Hannibal TV series. It is very well written and the acting is amazing. This movie just put a bad taste in my mouth for what has been an amazing collection of films and books, I recommend passing this one by.",1397692800,5,2760,4.48804780876494

1597155,1,B00005JPKW,"wow, what a terrible movie. I'm not sure what I expected, but this was a very very stupid origin story that fundamentally goes against the grain with common understanding of how psychopaths are ""created"" (instead of suffering from a lack of nurturing as an infant, hannibal becomes a psychopath by witnessing the brutalities of war as a 10 year old. Yeah, that's not how it works.

1597156,5,B00005JPKW,"Very surprised.  Second time watching...after the ill conceived cancellation of the NBC show.  This movie was quite a good compliment to Silence, making at least the origins have some logic.  Everything was much better than  expected. The actor was a wonderful choice.  He made young Hannibal his own character yet it explained origins of madness, not an attempted copy of Anthony Hopkins.  At the end it started to be a bit too much, but that's where it stopped.  Interesting twist at the end but there was no explanation of why Hannibal would have continued beyond the explanation of this movie. Maybe he was scarred by his parents giving him that name too. I don't think this movie could stand alone without having seen Silence to make it relevant, but that said, It was an interesting prequel.  While I always could do with less violence, I don't think it was avoidable under these circumstances and the great tv series was far more graphic. It did bring to mind the second Hannibal with the way he treated Starling and explained his refinements well.  It could easily been a characterature .

1597158,2,B00005JPKW,"A bad guy who shoots people at the mall might ""rise"" this way. But we're talking about a bad guy who kills people and EATS THEM. Is this how such a man-monster is made? Such a brilliant man-monster with prodigious kitchen skills, to boot. Ulliel as Lecter sneers his way cartoonishly through awkward moments with his aunt-by-marriage, near escapes, and semi-brutal murders; if you expect the sneer to become more sinister or more wicked or more seductive by the end of Hannibal Rising, DON'T. We only get a brat who cries when he learns the truth about his past, and then proceeds to go wolfman on a bad guy who, in this film, seems way way worse than Ulliel's Hannibal. The movie itself is only worth 1/2 star, but Dominic West's performance is at least believable for the most part. Nothing else here is, and I refuse to believe this is how Hannibal Lecter ""rose."" Boring, absent of mystique, and a major letdown for any fan of the Cannibal in any of his previous (or current, yay Mads!) iterations.

P.S. Hannibal's relationship with his Japanese aunt is ridiculous. However, given Ulliel's performance and interpretation of his subject, it is entirely possible that the movie is a thinly veiled spoof, and that Hannibal ""Rising"" refers to this same not-even-incest romance.",1396915200,,1277,4.831050228310502

1597193,5,B00005JPKW,"This prequel answers some of the questions on how Hannibal Lechter became the monster that we all know and loathe.

Unlike some prequels where the main character is developed to fit ""who"" the character will later become, this film develops the Hannibal character so well that ""Hannibal Rising"" would be an excellent ""stand alone"" film.

While there were a few gory scenes, these scenes were used as an integral part of the story and, unlike many horror films in which bloody, gory scenes are nothing more than gratuitous. The actual ""violence"" is essential to the story and, for the most part, is not sadistic or too ""over the top.""

This film is not appropriate for the younger viewers due not only for the violence, but also because of the complexity of the story, the concepts of which would be too confusing for the kids.

Overall, this is an excellent film that a true suspense fan would appreciate. The violence, romance and drama are well balanced and completely applies to the story of Hannibal's early, formative years.",1396137600,,1028,4.823863636363637

If one is interested in the nature of evil, I'd recommend the film.  But don't expect insight into the mind of a madman.  It is, of course, gruesome at times, but keeps the gore to a minimum for what is a story of the making of a homicidal maniac.

What it misses is how he made the mental leap to harming or killing those who are clearly evil to those who are not. So the point where he ""snaps"" is only hinted at.  It may be there, but, if so, the movie didn't provide the subsequent action to give it clarity.  Perhaps that was the point, but, if so, that could have been brought out too.

1597279,4,B00005JPKW,"There are a number of things that can result in a dog pile of critics ganging up on a film to trash it. One of them is production problems, notably over budget and over schedule. Examples: Cimino's ""Heaven's Gate"" and more recently ""The Lone Ranger."" Seems that many critics feel compelled to exact revenge and inflict punishment on a troubled film and its director on behalf of the film industry.

Another is what occurred with this film. Rumor on the street is Dino De Laurentis, the producer heavily involved with the last three films in the Lecter ""franchise"" coerced the novel series author, Thomas Harris, to write a fourth prequel novel, and then do the screenplay for this film (or De Laurentis would find someone else to do it). I have no idea whether that's true or not, but have little doubt a good portion of the thrashing this film has suffered at the hands (pens) of critics has more to do with that than the merits of the film itself.

Overview of Lithuania, 1918-1953 (skip this if you know the history):
The country was steamrollered by invading armies three times during WWII, first by the Soviets (1940), then by the Germans (1941), and finally by the Soviets again (1944; they didn't leave until 1993). It's a Nordic-Baltic country on the eastern side of the Baltic sea, across from Sweden and Denmark. During the rise of the Russian Empire, it was sucked by the end of the 18th Century along with Estonia, Latvia and Finland, the first two being the other smaller countries along the Baltic. Look at maps of the former Russian Empire and the former Soviet Union. The massive country was nearly landlocked. A major part of their strategic importance was an outlet to the Baltic. At the end of WWI in 1918 with the Russian revolution, Lithuania successfully declared its independence from Russia and was able to maintain it. This continued until 1939 with the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact that partitioned Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union. Part of that deal that isn't widely known was the Soviet Union being allowed to occupy Lithuania without German intervention. The Soviet Union invades Lithuania in 1940 and annexes it, brutally wreaking havoc on Lithuanians to properly collectivize and ""Sovietize"" them. A year later in June 1941, Germany launches Operation Barbarossa, their invasion of the Soviet Union, which includes invading and occupying what had been Lithuania a year earlier. They proceed to wreak havoc on the civil population, especially the Jews and anyone suspected of having been a Soviet ""collaborator."" In 1944, Germany retreats from the Baltic and the Soviet Union invades again, only to wreak havoc once more with revenge on anyone remotely suspected of collaborating or even sympathizing with the Germans. After the war, Lithuania remained part of the Soviet Union, sold down the river by Churchill and Roosevelt by pointedly failing to address the three Baltic states (Estonia and Latvia the other two) in the Yalta Conference. Large numbers of highly organized partisans with uniforms, insignia and formal rank/command structure continued to pursue an effective revolt against Soviet occupation until about 1953 when resistance finally fell apart, although it continued in very small numbers into the 1960's. The historical aspect of the film's Lithuanian setting in WWII is sufficiently accurate; it isn't about the war per se, but about what the rogue German armed Lithuanian partisans did as the Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944.

The film uses WWII and what occurred in Lithuania to provide the backdrop and horrific events with the rest of his immediate family (mother, father and younger sister) that set Hannibal Lecter on his psychopathic trajectory as a serial killer. We get to see him as a young boy during WWII that ultimately travels from Lithuania through Eastern Europe, through West Germany and ultimately to the widow of his uncle in France. Initially he cannot consciously remember what occurred at the family lodge in Lithuania. While in France under the care of his aunt, he begins medical school and eventually is able to consciously remember the events that killed his family, setting him on a course of revenge that continues to the end of the film. There is a time gap between this film and Red Dragon, but it's not difficult to fill it with the list of serial killings in the ongoing investigation revealed at the beginning of Red Dragon. Knowing more than that wouldn't be of much benefit to Hannibal Rising as it already provides more than enough to fully understand the root cause of Lecter's psychopathy. There's plenty of material for empathy with Lecter, if one chooses to feel it. There are also plenty of horrifically abhorrent acts to revile. That's where I believe the strength of this film lies: a character whose childhood experiences and desire for revenge can evoke strong empathy combined with his revoltingly repulsive acts of revenge.",1395446400,8,4941,5.0085158150851585

Great addition to the story.",1393459200,,358,4.609375

I would get to a certain point in the movie and it would stop and then after many long minutes of refreshing it would either give me the ""error, this movie can not be played at this time"" or it would rewind back to a certain point and start over.

1597466,2,B00005JPKW,The plot line is too dark.  Disturbing to watch. I would not recommend this.  I would chose something much lighter.,1392595200,,115,4.7
1597467,4,B00005JPKW,i like the ww2 action and the way it turned young hannibal to the person he became .i like the japannese woman she great.good movie.,1392508800,,132,4.32

1597504,5,B00005JPKW,Have loved all the movies about Hannibal and this one was a great incite into his behavior. Whoa baby this movie teaches you to be careful what you do to other people and their families,1392163200,,185,4.314285714285714
1597505,5,B00005JPKW,"I've watched Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal but I think this one is my favorite.  Trauma can bend you or break you. Revenge keeps your heart frozen or aflame. In this movie you really do learn what made Dr. Lecter the man he grew up to be.",1392163200,,254,4.08
1597506,1,B00005JPKW,Terrible. Does not make any sense. Not anywhere near the caliber of the other movies. Just glorified gore and shock value.,1391990400,,122,4.857142857142857
1597507,4,B00005JPKW,This is a very good movie. It will probably not win any film awards but it does a very good job of explaining Hannibal Lecter's background and how it all got started. If you started off watching Silence of The Lambs then this film will answer a lot of questions and fill in the gap so to speak. You have the bonus of Gong Li being in this film as she plays one of the main characters. She is a brilliant Chinese actress. I would recommend the film for interested adults but not anyone under 17.,1391990400,,494,4.15625
1597568,3,B00005JPKW,"The action sequences were satisfying, but the love story, while understandable because of the attractiveness of the actors, was not convincingly developed.  The other issue is this motif of the serial killer as someone shaped by traumatic events; Dexter by witnessing his mothers brutal murder as a very young child, and Hannibal Lecter from his wartime trauma.  Reality check:  most serial killers have completely normal family histories.  That's what makes them so scary.  We can't preemptively predict them.",1391904000,,510,5.487179487179487

1597632,5,B00005JPKW,Gaspard Ulliel was absolutely creepy. He did a fantastic job of portraying Hannibal the Cannibal. If you are looking for a good thriller then stream this movie.,1391040000,,160,4.962962962962963
1597633,5,B00005JPKW,It was a very well done movie that explained how Hannibal because what he was in the other movies. I will definitely watch it again in the near future.,1390953600,,151,4.241379310344827
1597634,2,B00005JPKW,Not nearly as frightening as the other movies Red dragon or Hannibal.  Slow in places but still interesting approach to the why of Hannibal's behavior.,1390953600,,151,5.04

1597658,4,B00005JPKW,"Put aside your notions of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or MANHUNTER or RED DRAGON or the horrible HANNIBAL, only keep in mind that you are familiar with the character and this is a good movie.  A good story that makes perfect sense, with good performances and quality production make HANNIBAL RISING a rather good watch.",1390867200,,312,4.672727272727273

1597660,2,B00005JPKW,This movie tries to justify what Hannibal becomes later in life.  You cannot create a psychopath by putting him in certain conditions.  Those psychopathic tendencies can be enhanced but it has to be there to begin with.  He was born with his psychopathic tendencies.  The story line was gory at times but predictable.  Also the Chinese actor playing his Aunt didn't look Japanese at all.,1390867200,,387,4.892307692307693
1597661,4,B00005JPKW,I thought that this movie was a great addition to the Hannibal Lector series. They did a fantastic job of tying everything with Hannibal together.,1390867200,,146,4.88

I just didn't feel the young Hannibal in the movie was the same genius he was in the other movies. He was more of fast moving psycho than a psychological genius. I was let down, but gave it three stars simply because it gave Hannibal a background to go with the other movies.",1390608000,,439,4.057471264367816
1597664,4,B00005JPKW,"Interesting but not very original.  The Dracula like similarities of Hannibal's ""Rising"" personality do not fit the Hannibal we were introduced to in Silence of the Lambs, However, it was captivating in its own way.",1390435200,,215,5.142857142857143

1597667,5,B00005JPKW,Interesting  very well  done and makes sense to the character's background ... Just a little slower than expected but good,1390435200,,122,5.05

1597729,5,B00005JPKW,Since my husband and I have the 3 other versions this one rates right up there with the other 3. Great movie on how Hannibal started out in his childhood.,1390262400,,154,4.166666666666667
1597730,4,B00005JPKW,Good historical fiction background. Also if you are a Hannibal fan this movie almost turns him into a sympathetic character,1390176000,,123,5.2
1597731,3,B00005JPKW,"The acting is well done, and they did stay true to later movies in this series. Most series now-a-days just do their own thing not respecting that they're tampering with a later movie set up, but they stay true to the movies that follow and carry off a nice movie. The setting are well done, and the pacing is good. There are even a few twists I didn't see coming. I found it odd because I expected a physical thriller and found something more akin to a drama, mental thriller. It has good action and keeps you watching, but it's not active. As such, I don't quite know what to sum its worth up to. I'd love to give this movie three and a half stars, but they won't let me. Four stars equals a more set win of a movie in my mind, and like I say, I'm still working out what I make of the movie so far. After more thought, I will say this movie's likely the best of the Hannibal Lector series.",1390176000,,891,4.068181818181818

It was well acted and very well directed with great cinema photography. GREAT HD from Amazon.,1390089600,,264,4.0
1597733,5,B00005JPKW,Thriller. I loved seeing how Hannibal became. This put all the pieces together for me and now the series makes perfect sense. It was a very good movie.,1390089600,,151,4.428571428571429

1597782,5,B00005JPKW,We failed to watch this movie when it originally came out because it did not have our favorite cast in it.  Our mistake as this is a super Hannibal movie.  Going to watch it again!,1389657600,,180,4.114285714285714
1597783,3,B00005JPKW,"Hannibal Lecter is certainly an intriguing character, and after Silence of the Lambs one could understand the compelling storylines
possible that could be told about him. Red Dragon, Hannibal were both interesting stories but also equally lacking.
This ""prequel"" has some interesting characters, and it's highly possible to see that Hannibals origins could have happened as presented. But the actor portraying Sir Anthony Hopkins doesn't have the same on screen charisma that Hopkins did in SoL.
The love story of Hannibal and his Aunt was an excellent back story to illustrate Hannibals life long bachelorhood. But as a continuation of the lore of such a compelling character, this movie fell short. I've had this on my watch list for quite sometime, it was
always one of those movies I said ""well I'll get to it someday"". I finally got to it, don't consider it time wasted (hence the ""It's okay"" rating) but will consider it an independent movie, segregated from the rest of the storyline of Hannibal Lecter.",1389571200,,1010,5.017857142857143

1597787,3,B00005JPKW,"This movie attempts to flesh out the background of Dr. Hannibal Lecter - including what traumatic event provided the 'stressor' that pushed him into cannibalism, where he developed his mannerisms, etc.  The movie accomplishes all of that, but still feels a bit like a strained, run-of-the-mill revenge thriller. Worth a watch, however this is one of those cases where the book is pretty much exactly the same as the film, and both feel like they were cranked out just to be done with it.",1389398400,,487,4.7976190476190474

1597830,1,B00005JPKW,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It basically has a young Hannibal seeking revenge on some war criminals who wronged his family during WWII. However, there are very few traits (if any at all) that the character in this movie shares with the Hannibal played by Sir Anthony Hopkins in the ""later"" films. Rather than showing how a young Hannibal developed into a twisted and sadistic serial murderer, we just get a story about a young man seeking revenge for his family. Also, *Spoiler Alert* he succeeds in seeking revenge on these war criminals, and he shows no signs of having a desire or need to kill anyone else (except for earlier in the film when Hannibal kills an obese Frenchman who has shown himself to be ignorant, racist, and unapologetic when he insults Hannibal's ""love interest"" such that the viewer is once again rooting for Hannibal because his victim more or less gets what's coming to him). Basically, he sets out on a quest to hunt down a group of people, which he does, so there is no sign that there will be anything more. He accomplished his goal. He definitely seems damaged from the whole experience such that he will never have a normal, happy life, but it appears to be something that he could easily get over and move on with.

This movie took what was a believable character into something outrageous. How many serial murderers do you know of who preyed on seemingly random and innocent citizens, but got into the killing game by hunting down and killing a group of war criminals? The whole story is unrealistic, and the only real connection this prequel has with its predecessors is in the name. Also, it didn't help that the lead actor was terrible. It's like the director just told him to try and ""look amusingly crazy"" all the time. I couldn't take him seriously.",1389225600,7,1801,4.64576802507837

I got the feeling that the actor that played young Hannibal tried to emulate Hopkins from the first film too closely, and this was not appropriate.  If anything, Hopkins over-acted the Lecter character, but this could be excused as he is only shown institutionalized, and this could reasonably be the cause of a person acting out (in the later films, when he has escaped, he acts less eccentric, which bolsters this argument).  Here, Hannibal is still a young man, and would more likely be less...creepy acting.  It just didn't feel convincing to me.",1388275200,,709,4.8347107438016526

The actor who plays young Hannibal does a great job - he has the intensity that is one of the major characteristics of the adult Hannibal.

I knew Hannibal was a genius but I didn't know to what extent and this was spelled out in the movie.

The actor playing him just doesn't do it for me.

The story of Hannibal Lector is ultimately a drama and not a strictly at tale of horror, though it is horrific. The key to a good drama is character development and that by the end of the movie or story the main characters need to have changed by the events in their life. Unfortunately there is no change in Lector once a young man besides a slight inclination towards more violence. In fact what's worse in that his psychopathy was all but fated due to trauma in his childhood. So the audience is simply shown a psychotic acting out his impulses, and the anticipation what will happen next is on the level of a Final Destination movie. In other words, let's see the psycho enact more bloody revenge. Being that it's a prequel of course Hannibal is going to live and so any ""close call"" he has is anything but. The movie and story falls flat, the acting is adequate from the secondary characters, but with Li Gong walking around glassy eyed and Gaspard Ulliel overacting in the kill scenes. Perhaps the biggest failing of the movie is that the tragedy of his sister is never portrayed as a tragedy befalling a little girl, but rather a McGuffin for Lector.",1386028800,,1178,4.535211267605634

1598432,4,B00005JPKW,"This movie tries to explain why Hannibal Lecter turned out the way he did.  It tells the tale of a young Lecter, played by Gaspard Ulliel, who seeks revenge on soldiers that killed his family during World War II, and how what they did to his little sister specifically tuned him into a killer. We see the transformation from a scared kid, into what he ultimately becomes.  It has a strong supporting cast including Dominic West, Rhys Ifans (as the leader of the group of soldiers that kills his family) and Gong Li who plays his widowed Aunt and the person he tries to have a ""normal"" relationship with.  Even that relationship is far from normal.

Obviously anyone playing the character is going to be measured against Anthony Hopkins' iconic portrayal.  I think Gaspard Ulliel did a good job with the character at this point in the story.  You can tell he tried to mirror some of what Hopkins did, but he also played him different than the adult version.  In my opinion it is not as good as Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal or even Red Dragon, but if you look at it as its own story and accept someone else in the role than it is enjoyable.

As far as extras goes, there are a couple trailers, some deleted scenes a commentary track, and a 16 min making of featurette.  About what you would expect for this kind of movie.  In all, I think it is a good addition to the story.  Not as good as the Hopkins films, but definitely worth adding to your collection.",1380672000,,1457,4.399253731343284

  Evidently, it's the origin for the psychopathic doctor we will soon see in stories like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dragon-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JLKN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dragon (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, But while the killings of his family, especially his beloved younger sister, can make us understand his grief, his subsequent actions don't make him very sympathetic.  By the way, how much therapy did Gaspard Ulliel and Aaran Thomas need after shooting all these scenes with abuse, cannibalism, near-incest, and everything else?
  Speaking of Gaspard Ulliel, he did a decent job as the young Lector we know and loathe.  But he couldn't get past the bad writing in the script, and that isn't his fault.  The character just wasn't written well in this story.  Mr. Ulliel did his best with what he had to work with.
  I know they had wanted Anthony Hopkins to narrate the film as his character from the previous films, but he unfortunately declined...too bad...I can't help but wonder what could have been.
  I will say that I wouldn't put any of Hannibal Lector's actions past him based on what I know about the character from previous works, but it is simply hard to then also sympathize with him, no matter what.  I will praise Kevin McKidd and his merry men for their portrayal as the ruthless band of Nazi-wannabes whose crimes are too sickening to repeat...how is it that the villains in this film series are always the best?  Overall, if you want to leave this film out of your Hannibal Lector collection, it wouldn't be a crime to do so.

1598510,3,B00005JPKW,"I've seen all of the Hannibal films:  ""Silence of the Lambs,"" a pretty terrific serial killer film; ""Hannibal,"" an almost unwatchable gross-out-fest that forgets that nastiness isn't always appealing; ""Red Dragon,"" a decent but forgettable film; ""Manhunter,"" a good but overrated film as it wasn't particularly realistic, with a detective with unreasonable powers; and now ""Hannibal Rising,"" perhaps the most interesting film of the lot but at the same time maybe the hardest to recommend.

I really liked how this film was set in Europe; the cinematography was pretty terrific and some of the sights were as well.  One thing that I wished that the director might have done:  have the actors speak in the natural language of the particular countries and use English subtitles.  I think that that would have made it more realistic.  However, since I believe that the movie was filmed in Lithuania, France and perhaps Germany (at least according to the film), ""Hannibal Rising"" might have then become a foreign film, which most likely wasn't the intent.  It would have been interesting in some scenes, however, for actors to have spoken in their native tongue.

I didn't like how the Hannibal Lecter character stretched out some of his murders.  This was not realistic to me, as most serial killers tend to take few risks and get things over in a hurry, and yes, I know there are exceptions.  I do understand that the director did this for dramatic effect, and that worked well sometimes; other times, not so much.  The ending in particular was a little grisly, and I would imagine that quite a few viewers would be turned off by that.  Most likely, real-life serial killers would actually even groan while watching that scene.

I believe that the main theme of the film might be:  ""Evil begets evil.""  After all, something really evil happens to the young Hannibal at the beginning -- I won't say what that is since it might be an unnecessary giveaway -- and from then on, his entire existence appears to be just getting vengeance.  He is shown becoming a doctor at a very young age, and if the old doctors' mantra ""Do no harm"" should be followed, Hannibal is surely a poor example of that.

A mixed bag for me, but overall, probably the second best film in the series.  That doesn't necessarily mean that it's very realistic, however, and it doesn't necessarily mean that it's any good.  And it's surely not for everyone.  But if you're into the genre, then this would be a mild recommendation.",1378771200,,2494,4.796252927400468

The one thing I've done since then is READ author Thomas Harris' trllogy, so I have a better perspective of the characters ( an UNCUT version of what we see on the screen) and EXPERIENCE that world in a whole new way and that is what I missed out on with Hannibal Rising.

I was looking for a tale at least narrated by Anthony Hopkins but was given something that gave more definition than Sir Anthony's words could not. I saw him survive both the harsh Winter's ""claiming"" of his sister, his liberation from a Russian orphanage and his new loves and positions in life.

The movie was okay. I could read the subtitles enough wherever needed, but it just does not have the same flair as Mr Harris' trilogy, but I am going to buy this book and read all four then buy Silence Of The Lambs and have a film festival.

Having watched a disturbingly broken-up Theatrical Version airing on Logo, it was great to watch the Uncut Version, in which Hannibal's development seems more complete and the narrative flows more smoothly. The only thing I really missed between Harris' book and the two movies that cover his ""Hannibal"" is the insight into Lecter's memory palace the book gives us; admittedly, it would not be an easy thing to convey on film.",1367539200,,908,5.565217391304348
1598688,2,B00005JPKW,"Let's face it:  A little Lecter goes a long way.  He's best deployed in small doses, such as ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Red Dragon"", and Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" (if you've never seen Brian Cox's Hannibal, you're missing out!).  But ""Hannibal Rising"" is - much to its detriment - ALL Hannibal, ALL the time.

Gaspard Ulliel does his best as the young Hannibal, but he's trying entirely too hard, especially with that crazy smile of his.  It doesn't help that I want to laugh every time I look at him, because he looks just like SNL's Andy Samberg (of ""D*ck in a Box"" and ""Lazy Sunday"" fame).  Rhys Ifan's performance is one for the ages, and not really in a good way. I'm sure he was hoping to make his audience shudder in fear at his every word and move.  But his screaming, his eye-rolling, and his over-the-top wickedness made me giggle instead.  And Gong Li is an absolute knock-out, no one can argue with that.  Too bad her character exists mainly to give the movie a little sword play, foreplay, and sex appeal (plus she gets to whisper/scream ""HANNIBAL!"" every now and then).

""Hannibal Rising"" is a bloody, overwrought revenge melodrama, populated by poorly-written characters played by a (mostly) talented cast.  When a film makes you long for the subtle cinematic touch of Brett Ratner (who did a solid job directing ""Red Dragon""), then you KNOW you've got a problem!  However, if you prefer your scenery well-chewed, and your acting on the hammy side, then you might find something to enjoy in ""Hannibal Rising"".",1367539200,,1523,4.7272727272727275

Hannibal Rising is a great movie in theory to make although, both Amber and I were not so pleased with the lead they chose but, I guess the movie studios didn't know if this was a gamble or not.  It's not as great as Silence of the Lamb (but, none of them are now are now, are they?)  But, if you're a Hannibal Fannibal and wanna know why he eats peeps then we totally say WATCH this one!!!

It was much better than I expected - in fact it was actually pretty good. I guess some material does better as a movie.  The thing I liked most about it was how Hannibal's mannerisms matched up with those of Anthony Hopkins in the later movies: the grin, the way he cants his head, the way he moves his hands, even posture.",1364947200,,609,4.058333333333334

In fact, the man who made Hannibal Lecter a household name, doesn't so much as have a cameo in this film. Hannibal Rising takes the story to where it's never been before, back to the beginning. We see a young Hannibal in Europe, during WWII, and we learn how he grew into the monster he became. What made this different from the other Lecter films, was that Hannibal is seen as a good guy for much of the film, just out seeking revenge. French film star Gaspard Ulliel is fantastic in his first American film and was the perfect choice to play a young lecter. As a fan of the film franchise, I found this movie fascinating, but as an outsider I can see how some people would find it a bit long and slow.",1361664000,,798,4.3624161073825505

The books, as the film are indeed storywise far-fetched. 2. The movie is really good, especially the actors (down to the smallest character) are well cast and deliver  great performances.

1598839,4,B00005JPKW,"Nothing beats the first Hannibal, but overall this movie does explain how he became Hannibal the Cannibal.  The older Hannibal and the younger Hannibal are both demented and twisted, but I really cannot see how the older more charismatic Hannibal came from the odd younger Hannibal as far as personality is concerned; maybe education and years did it.
In the beginning of the flick Hannibal's parents leave their castle and go into hiding due to the war and the invasion of the Germans.  They are killed and Hannibal attempts to take care of himself and his little sister who are now alone.  Some brutes take over the house and they are all starving to death.  Eventually they decide to kill and eat the sister; justifying their action by the sister being sick and would die anyway.  Hannibal's insanity is introduced.  I don't recall how he got away for the cannibals, but some Americans soldiers find him walking in the snow close to death.  He grows up in an orphanage which is actually his family's old estate.  There is a hierarchy in which the older orphans take advantage of the younger, but Hannibal is defiant until he runs away.  Travel.... Travel.... Travel.... He makes it to an uncle's house
His step aunt is Asian her husband, Hannibal biological uncle has died, but she invites this relative by marriage to move in; a guy that shows up from nowhere with a picture.  Young Hannibal falls in love/lust, whatever, for his step Auntie who I think worshipped her ancestors, and I think she falls in love with him too.  The entire story line was very weird.  This takes place after WWII, so I may not be able to relate to the times, culture or customs.  Where I am from we don't invite strangers in to live without a living soul to vouch for the person.
One day the two go to the market and the butcher is beyond rude, completely vulgar to the Hannibal's step Auntie; no one says anything to this guy about his nasty comment to a lady; again maybe I do not have an understanding of the era.  If I recall Hannibal causes a bit of stir.  Eventually, Hannibal kills the guy and the Auntie who has taught Hannibal about revenge covers for him, although she is mortified by his actions.
Hannibal goes off to school, but seeks revenge on the men that ate his sister.  They are all despicable, loathsome creatures, but have become respectable despicable, loathsome creatures and pimps; a pimp is a pimp in any kind of suite.  I don't want to ruin the move, but Hannibal does get his revenge and although we know he wins because of the other movies there are some moment where one can forget and wonder is they will get him or if he will get them.  Overall, even with the oddities I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again.",1352851200,,2727,4.530612244897959

This clumsy adaptation has more gaps than a crack whore's smile and a little less charm. The acting was mostly wooden and flat. Whoever adapted this film left out vital subtleties that form the foundation for the character so masterfully portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. We see Hannibal as a child and a young adult, but we don't ever get into his head. That's where the fun is, right? We're here to peep, as it were, into his psyche. This portrayal of young Hannibal lacks the dimension we need in order to appreciate the depths of his intelligence. That is, after all, his greatest weapon. In the book, we know right away that Hannibal is a genius -and a bit peculiar. Not a monster and not just another little boy. The glosses over all of this. What the movie does include is ludicrous: Lady Murasaki teaching Hannibal how to fight with a katana. That is where I had to turn it off.

Instead get the wide-screen edition DVD. It'll play fine on your Blu-ray with an excellent picture and this film is certainly worth watching for all Hannibal Lecter fans and all fans of Thomas Harris. It was not a big hit when it first hit the theaters and I don't know why. It is very good. An excellent screenplay (the first by Thomas Harris) and very good direction by Peter Weber. I guess folks were tired of the series. It is an underrated thriller. I can't believe the Blu-ray edition had any input by Harris or Weber. It is a waste of the Blu-ray format.

1598938,2,B00005JPKW,"I've heard that Harris wrote the novel with an eye towards this movie being made (someone else was going to tell the origin story if he didn't)...but the differences between the two are glaring. I made the rookie mistake of writing an extensive review of this film before viewing the last fifteen minutes (sorry); after watching the climax of the movie (and picking my jaw up off the floor) I decided to rewrite. Hannibal Lecter is (obviously) a very complex character, and regardless of whatever pressures Harris might have felt while writing the book, it was still a quality novel - it does a good job of fleshing out the title character's back story. I bought the DVD with my expectations properly adjusted - a two hour movie obviously cannot replicate all of the details, relationships, and careful narrative of a 323 page novel. That being said, there were moments in the film that completely flipped the book's story on it's head, ESPECIALLY near the end. Lines were added that were completely unnecessary, and radically altered the audience's perception of character motivations from what was laid down in the novel. Sigh. The liberties of film adaptation strike again.

Gong Li is stunningly beautiful, and does extremely well with a character whose depth and purpose has been criminally minimized (obviously not her fault)...Gaspard Ulliel is actually quite good as well (though his arrogance near the end is a bit over the top), but the material they've been given (or lack thereof) limits their impact. The movie is well made (edited, shot) and the scences and period details are great, but...this movie takes a great character study and disseminates it into a simple thriller. The text takes great care with the relationship between Hannibal and Lady Murasaki, letting it grow over time from a maternal protectorate of woman over boy to a respectful love between two adults. The film just throws a post-pubescent Hannibal into her presence and somehow expects us to believe that (TWO SCENES LATER) some kind of great connection grew between them...seemingly, FROM NOWHERE. This type of compression/simplification happens throughout. Regardless, I gave the film 3 stars in my initial review - it is well acted and nice to look at- but after watching the end (and the aforementioned story flipping moments) I feel compelled to reduce that to 2. In the end, I don't think this is a story that can be effectively told through film...there are too many subtleties present in the novel (that, in their entirety, do the complex character that is Hannibal Lecter the proper justice) to be conveyed in a single film (or even 2). The actors try, and are often good, but the script lets them down.

My final thought? If you love the series (and the Lecter character)...read the book. It's worth your time.",1333497600,,2806,4.942796610169491
1598939,4,B00005JPKW,"This movie finally explains the origins of Hannibal the Cannibal. It's a pretty twisted movie, but that's what makes it good. It doesn't hold light to the Silence of the Lambs, but it's a good stand alone movie. They choose a good lead actor to play Hannibal. You feel like this is really him as a young adult.

The story allows Hannibal to come back to life once again in a very disturbing way, and it gives you a nice back story that has him slowly becoming more psychopathic. It starts off during 1944, and continues eight years later. Some drastic events happen, which pushes the story in motion. While the story is really good, I don't like the woman at the second half of the movie due to her making some contradictory decisions.

They picked the right character to portray the iconic image of Hannibal Lector. You really feel like this is what he would be like when he is a young man, and how these events later shaped him into the man we see in the latter movies. Also, you can tell the character starts enjoying what he is doing more and more, and that just makes it more twisted.

Takes place during and post World War II; but has its own feel too it. What I mean is with so many World War II movies out there, this area of France is different than what has been filmed before. You get to see different season during the movie, and it is pulled off well. I believed it was winter when they showed the vast area with snow, along with summer and whatnot.

The music adds to the movie, especially with that children's song that just becomes chilly when the movie goes along. Sound effects of the swords, cleavers, and gun fire sound loud and real. With this movie many different guns are being fired and each one has its only unique sound (like it obviously would in real life).

This movie has some special features, but most of it is lackluster. Like so many movies with behind the scenes, they show so many scenes from the movie that doesn't need to be there. The only time you should have something like that is when you're showing either story boarding or CG stuff. Even with that, they only show the people sitting in a chair and talking about it, which most if not all of that information is told during the commentary. Commentary is insightful into how the movie was made (like most commentaries out their), and can be interesting at times. You can tell why they removed the deleted scenes, they're nothing spectacular.

Overall I think you should pick this movie up if you enjoyed the other Hannibal movies. It gives you more insight to the mind of him, and how he became the person he is in those movies.

1598982,1,B00005JPKW,"This movie is laughable and is almost reminiscent of one of those 90s butcher flicks where there's a weak story as a excuse for a slaughter. Where do I begin? For starters, they completely missed the boat on the complex nature of Hannibal Lecter for he is no weak, blood driven psychopath. There's nothing in this movie that remotely hints at the sophisticated genius and savage animal that both grow within Hannibal at equal measure. The sexual tension between Hannibal and his 'aunt' is also a joke for to date none of his movies have ever indicated him toward a romantic interest in anything. His relationship with Starling herself was one that bordered on something between paternal and collegial as though she were a rare find of a colleague. So this movie is clearly a work of fantasy and I imagine if the author of the series were to watch it, he would either be inspired to laugh himself silly or cry at the misrepresentation of his greatest creation.",1324425600,,959,4.680473372781065
1598983,5,B00005JPKW,"I enjoyed the Eastern European flavor of Hannibals youth tale. Hannibal Rising is easily better than at least one Anthony Hopkins presence in sequel, perhaps two.
The actor portraying the youthful medical student Lecter excelled in his role. Have failed to see him in anything else and don't really understand why.
Glad I purchased the streaming version though I had the DVD....made it easier to remain captain of my couch and my status as a video potato.....keeps my mind off the Presidents murder of our country.

1598985,5,B00005JPKW,"I've read the Harris books, and was most intrigued by Hannibal Rising.  Didn't watch the movie until just now, purchased here through Prime Instant Video.  Acting superb, film editing A++++ (my big complaint about most films regards editing).  The movie strays from the book at key points, yet depends on you knowing the book.  You get a different idea of the story, if you've not read the book.  If you have, the 'straying' complements the book instead of contradicting it, especially with regard to certain elements in the book which weren't much explained.  Good to see them depicted, here.

It is a brutal movie;  not gory, but the story line demands the brutality shown.  Good restraint in showing it, too.  Some moments were less-than-believable, but it didn't harm the viewing.  Key here is how people deal with trauma.  Like the other viewers, I hope to see a followup prequel covering the period between the end of this movie, up to where Red Dragon begins.

I don't want to give away the plot.  Very happy to have purchased it, as the acting, filiming is so good, I'll want to watch it many times.  Ulliel is fabulous, but so are all the other actors.  Great range given them.

1598986,2,B00005JPKW,"This movie had the potential to be so much more than it was. The end result is kind of sad, really. I wanted to like it as a fan of the character and other films, but...

The story and character seems bare in places, while developing way too quickly in others. Young Lecter goes from a timid, traumatized boy who doesn't speak to this sadistic and pompously vocal juvenile in an instant it seems. When the actor playing young Hannibal speaks, his efforts to sound eloquent and sinister seem unnatural and so transparently contrived.

Before you know it he's hunting people down, living with his aunt (Murasaki) who's covering up murders with him and attending medical school. This all culminates in a chaotic showdown on a boat with some mild yet gratuitous gore.

Both the detective and Murasaki at two separate points in the film suggest that Hannibal has no humanity left. When these lines are spoken, they seem out of place and unsolicited. So much so that you are left unshielded from the fact that they are simply perfunctory and an overdone attempt at dramatic effect. There were points early on where it could have been saved before it derailed. Around the part when he crossed the Russian border or perhaps when he injected himself to tap into his memories. Once he started picking off the Lithuanian antagonists of his youth and running around with Murasaki, trying too hard to act creepy and sound distinguished beyond his years, I think something got lost. There were elements which did work and could have worked better, but when taken as a whole - it flops.

For a character as deep and complex as Dr. Lecter, it struck me as way too simple and one-dimensional of an origin story. I get it, he saw his sister cannibalized. We are reminded repeatedly through flashbacks, but I couldn't help think ""Okay, what else went into who he became?""

Unfortunately, the fault may very well lie with the fact Dino DeLaurentis told Thomas Harris he was going to make this film with or without him. Harris didn't want the story written by someone else. So there you have it: it was authored begrudgingly, and likely hurriedly, to have something for the studio to peddle to the audience.

The stories between Lecter and Starling are similar, yet they chose opposite ends of the path.  Here are their similarities:

When they were both young they each became orphaned.

When they were orphaned they each had a charge to take care of, Starling trying to save the lamb, Lecter and his sister.  Which incidentaly, were both eaten.

This fractured Lecter while it steeled Starling and this is where they separate.  Starling is what Lecter could have been and he loves her for it.

1599125,5,B00005JPKW,"Gaspard Ulliel is the young Anthony Hopkins in every move, look and determination to be savage. We see Hannibal and his sister Misha with their whole family in a rich, beautiful and loving family. As the movie begins director Peter Weber opens the movie to one of the most beautiful scenes in the woods by a lake with the Lecter Castle magically situated in the background. Hannibal and Misha are playing and we feel so close to these unknown children. They are giggling and laughing reminding me of days with one of my younger sisters who was too young to really communicate. Misha has such a wonderful innocence and trusting character that you wish she were your daughter.

Tragedy quickly strikes as fast as lightening and we are swept up into a war with our wonderful Lecter family's get away. We wish them to move faster. They finally reach their cabin and war breaks out as they have all been told where to stand while Hannibal and Misha may stay in the house. Russian planes attack the opposing soldiers getting water from the cabin's well. A plane crash hits an object while other planes fire on any one they choose.

Thus begins Hannibal's relentless protection of Misha as long as he can. Then the memories of life with Misha seems like a spike in Gaspard's heart as he searches for Misha's killers. Gaspard begins the construction of understanding Anthony Hopkins Oscar winning performance of the Hannibal we all know and hate/love.

Every scene explains why Hopkins did this or that or how he knows fine things. Gaspard is highly intelligent and has no free time but to build on the rage burning in Gaspard from his childhood.

This movie is thrilling to watch. My roommate and I know all the words. We have watched it at least 30 times and have enjoyed it more on each viewing. Tonight we listened to director Peter Weber and Ms De Laurentiis. They are just fantastic speakers concentrating on what we were seeing. I've listened to other directors who are lackluster or talk too much to their guests; we never learn the anatomy of each scene that we come upon.

Like the movie Hostel<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>.

Hannibal Rising is a masterpiece of collaborate effort and we have to thank it mostly to the wonderful writing of Thomas Harris. Now I'm tempted to read the book.

See Hannibal Rising and discover how Gaspard grows up to be the horrific Anthony Hopkin's as Hannibal. Believe me this ties all the know-hows and reasons for all the Hannibal movies.

And do Japanese women really have....?

Frankly, this movie really sucks. ""The silence of the lambs"" was a *very* good movie. ""Hannibal"" was not. Care for some delicious brain, inspector Starling? And now this...

""Hannibal Rising"" depicts the story of Hannibal Lecter during his younger years, from a small boy who watched his parents die and his sister being eaten alive by neanderthalls, to a beautiful looking young man with revenge on his mind. This revenge is what makes Lecter into the monster that he became: it takes over his life like an addiction that he cannot break away from. There is always a reason behind one's behavior, even if that behavior means murdering people: this film explores all of this and more.
 Gasparo Ulliel, who plays Lecter, gives a virtuoso performance, and I am sure Anthony Perkins is proud that such a talented and gifted actor gave new life into the most haunting movie villin of all-time.
 Thomas Harris, who wrote the original ""Silence of the Lambs"", wrote the screenplay for ""Hannibal Rising"". An impeccable script.

1599180,5,B00005JPKW,"How it began. What can happen to a nice boy if enough bad things happen in rapid succession. And how it carries over into later life.

""Rising"" tells the early story of today's most popular villian, when he was a young boy in Lithuania, with caring parents, a nice home, and a close relationship with his baby sister. The film makers stress on this relationship, taking care to portray him as the doting brother over this very sweet, likable little girl, and when Nazi occupiers storm the region, it is very tough segment to watch. The family takes refuge in a home in a wooded area, with some friends, and a Russian tank pulls up to the house, but the soldiers only want some water. German fighter planes appear overhead, along with German tanks on the ground, accompanied with gunfire and bombs, and these two horrified little kids see their parents die in a hail of bullets and shrapnel. The homes in the area are looted, and those in the Nazi's way are exterminated (""...Are you a Jew? Are you a Gypsy?...""). It's a harsh Winter, and these men are starving, and since little Mischa has Pneumonia, she is put on the menu.

Cut to eight years later...

Hannibal is then sent to live in an academy, which is located in the building which was once his home. You can see his bitterness. He won't join in the mindless behavior expected of the cadets, and is punished for hurting bullies. He escapes the academy, and manages to locate his aunt, a Japanese woman his late uncle married after she lost it all in Hiroshima, and she provides him with some desperately needed structure in his life. She teaches him self-discipline, and Japanese swordsmanship, which comes in handy when a truly repulsive man insults her honor in a public market. He slaughters this slob like a hog, and he becomes young Hannibal's first victim, his head removed with one slice to the neck.

The story takes on a ""Death Wish"" tone, as Hannibal becomes a vigilante, locating the men who looted his home and killed and devoured his beloved little sister, a man on a mission. But perverse twists of events in the story lead to what would become his transformation, from crusader, to the icy-eyed sociopath he would later become, and he really has a heavy load he has to carry for the rest of his life.

I found myself rooting for him wholeheartedly all the way through, and toward the end, when he gets his ultimate shock, I really felt bad for him.

Thomas Harris is a compelling writer, and where I have to admit I haven't read the book this is based on, I have read the others in the series, and even though many points in the novels were changed or deleted, it still makes for some truly gripping viewing.",1237161600,,2680,4.538302277432712
1599181,5,B00005JPKW,"I always wondered if Dr. Hannibal Lecter would be as fascinating and intriguing if not for Anthony Hopkins' performance in previous movies. Even As perfect as Hopkins' performance was, I think this great production of Hannibal rising rises to the same level of previous Hannibal movies and makes the book by Thomas Harris's a living novel.

The evolution of Hannibal's evil is captured flawlessly through great music, direction, production and the outstanding performance of the cast, especially Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal and Gong Li as Lady Murasaki. It is amazing how the physical and emotional attraction between these two characters captured by the camera through their looks and body language. This view provided by the camera was more profound and telling than any possible dialogue.

Simply put, when viewed in light of what comes later in the illustrious doctor's career, all credibility goes out of the window. It would have made far more sense if said cannibalistic killer had gone by a different name in Europe and had adopted the name 'Hannibal Lecter' upon entering Canada /America.

1599184,2,B00005JPKW,"This film purports to tell the story of Hannibal Lecter's childhood and the reason he became the diabolical serial killer we all love to fear.  However, it just doesn't ring true for me.  Here, Hannibal is on a righteous, if gruesome, mission to avenge the murder of his little sister, which provides an arc and dramatic sweep to his violence.  We never see him engaging in any of the childhood behaviors with have been pretty well established as classic precursors of serial killing, such as cruelty to animals.  When we contrast this with his behavior in earlier films, such as biting the face off a nurse who was leaning over him (referred to in ""Silence of the Lambs"") or killing and cooking a musician for hitting a bad note (""Red Dragon""), we are left to conclude that he must have developed a taste for murder as a result of his actions in this movie rather than his traumatic childhood.  Of course, I'm overanalyzing it.  The obvious reason for constructing the plot in this way is that the filmmakers want to build sympathy for Hannibal by rationalizing his despicable behavior as the product of a sensitive, hurt soul.  Actor Anthony Hopkins, ""Silence"" director Jonathan Demme, and even ""Red Dragon"" director Brett Ratner created a compelling character by making us fear Hannibal, not empathize with him.

On its own terms, this is just an okay movie (albeit one that wastes the wonderful Gong Li as a ridiculous Japanese stereotype).  As a chapter in the saga of Hannibal Lecter, it is a terrible misstep.",1234569600,2,1516,4.777777777777778

While this is a rather simplistic explanation of the psychopathology of a monster psychopath, it makes for a great viewing experience, so long as you want to witness his horrifically graphic series of atrocities.  The acting is extremely good, to say the least, and the story is coherent, full of incredible images, and tragic.

In my opionion this movie rates a close second behind SOTL, and is better than 'Hannibal' or 'Red Dragon' (though I highly enjoyed both of these films-I'm not bashing! Just stating my opinion!).

1599241,5,B00005JPKW,"The only thing I had heard about HANNIBAL RISING was that it was awful. So, I put off watching it until last night. I was shocked to see a well thought out tale of unimaginable childhood trauma, revenge, and psychopathic evolution. Hannibal Lecter (Gaspard Urriel) is a young man w/ no goal in life, other than to avenge the cannibalistic death of his little sister, Mischa. His mind is set. His conscience is clear. His mission is absolute. Hannibal lives only to keep his promise to Mischa, and there will be much blood shed in the process. Learning the ways of the Samurai from his aunt, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), Hannibal hones his skills in medical school, using cadavers as practice subjects. Human anatomy becomes Hannibal's roadmap in his quest for the most efficient methods of extermination. This will be very useful to him later on. Hannibal Lecter has grown up. His soul long shredded and lost, he takes those first steps. His will be a long and memorable career...",1226534400,2,976,4.747058823529412
1599242,4,B00005JPKW,"To begin a review of this film I think it is very important to acknowledge that it is is no way of the caliber of the Hannibal Lecter films with Anthony Hopkins and is in no way an intense psychological profile based horror film with deep characterizations.  It is in no way a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Luckily, I came into this knowing the book and movie both got bad reviews so I had no expectations.  And this allowed me to watch this film and enjoy it as a separate entity from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

The idea of seeing how the young Hannibal developed his desires and tastes for cruelty and sadistic murder is very intriguing and the plot certainly is overblown.  His family lived in Lithuania during the war and he watched his parents get killed and when he and his sister were alone, he saw soldiers invade the house and eventually devour his sister - supposedly in order to survive for they had no food.  Of course if a person viewed all this they would be affected for life.

I found Gaspard Ulliel, who plays Hannibal, to have a very strong screen presence and totally believed his madness and the purpose of avenging the death of his sister as a reason/excuse to begin his avenging those who were a part of her death.  What was difficult for me was that he did not speak until he finds his way to the home of his aunt and when he finally spoke it was very quietly and he had a very strong accent that had no hint whatsoever of how Hannibal spoke later in life as played by Anthony Hopkins.  The introduction of the aunt causes some confusion in the script.  She teaches him martial arts and how to use swords.  We do see how he possesses this ability but we don't see why she taught him this.

The last half of the film was excellent but not as a prequel explaining the true story of Hannibal Lecter but as an excellent horror film.  Each murder he commits is gruesome and very well filmed.  It is a quality horror film.  I believed his intensity and developing madness and was able to appreciate this film for what it was.

If you watch this film thinking you will see an intriguing intro ino the madness of Hannibal Lecter of the quality of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS you will be greatly disappointed.  But as a horror movie in its own right it is excellently made.  The acting is all around very good, the scares are there and the gore is plentiful and utilized in believable ways.  I ended up really enjoying this film for what it was.

Watch this with no more expectations than seing a fun, quality horror film that happens to have Hannibal Lecter in it.  The reasons for his desire to kill are fully explained but in a simple way but why his madness kept on evolving and he took pleasure in being a true monster is left alone.  You believe he is a monster but it is meant to just be accepted.",1223164800,4,2800,4.3034351145038165

1599244,1,B00005JPKW,"What a load of distasteful rot! But let's put aside the utterly feeble main lead, the idiotic pantomime villains and the tedious, sick and overly-drawn out plot...

What I want explaining is this... why was there a crescendo of build-up to the 'dramatic' moment when the young Lecter pulls on a face mask for the first time??

He would never had had this mask as a teenager - it was only ever put on his face many years later, when he was an adult prisoner in jail, to stop him biting people!

Fortunately this ludicrous and appalling gaping hole in the plot comes about 20 minutes into this 17-hour bum-number, by which time you will either have fallen asleep, or thrown your DVD player out the window in disgust.

Overall a worthless and cheap cash-in on the Hannibal Lecter 'franchise'... spend your money instead on a nice piece of liver and a bottle of Chianti.",1218758400,11,866,4.567741935483871
1599245,3,B00005JPKW,"This movie was okay.  Not great, not unwatchable.  This is not the first movie we've seen where someone systematically sought revenge, person by person, years after something horrific happens (though possibly none THIS horrific).  But we don't often see the revenge seeker start to engage in the hideous behavior for which he wanted revenge! But that's how Hannibal deals with it.

Just like the Anthony Hopkins Hannibal manages - through the horrors of what he does - to sort of be likeable in a weird way, so was this young guy.  Lecter never harms children or animals (see below), for example.  I guess what makes him a ""monster"" in his world's eyes is that he acts on his desire for revenge.  And once he got a taste (no pun intended), he never could stop.

Later in life, the issue wasn't revenge. So what was it? In ALL the movies, even he has boundaries.  And we love him for it.  He only ""eats the rude."" He goes after people who:
1) He finds distasteful or obnoxious (the flute player, Dr. Chilton, Mason Verger, who is the worst...and Multiple Miggs!) or
2) Whom he knows are hot on his trail (Will Graham, Inspector Pazzi...Clarice is the exception here.  He chopped off his hand to spare her...which makes him all the more endearing)
3) Kids and animals are off limits, if I recall right (though he did feed human brain to a child...okay, that is bad.  But the kid liked it.  Ugh).

Okay, back to the movie...Well, we understand the desire for revenge but he goes to awfully great lengths to exact it...which speaks to the psychotic part of him. So...now we technically know why he is who he is.  I'd love to see what happens between where the movie ends and where we pick up in Baltimore (Red Dragon) when he answers the door and it's Will Graham, because it's then that Hannibal is captured.",1217635200,,1805,4.544891640866873
1599246,5,B00005JPKW,"The book was perfect, the film is even more perfect than perfect. It is exactly what we could have dreamed of. The story is the absolute logical explanation of the previous volumes about Hannibal Lecter and we cannot think of one detail in these earlier volumes that is not the direct consequence of what happens in this later volume that tells the infancy, teenage and youth of Hannibal Lecter. What makes it so fascinatingly believable is that this period of his life is situated in Lithuania during the war and in the Soviet union and in France after the war. The political elements, allusions or direct references are correct even if at times slightly simplified, for instance the butcher, the first victim of Hannibal Lecter's on the French territory, who was a collaborator during the war and took part in the sending of some Jews to deportation could go on with his profession in spite of the hatred he had accumulated among people because as a butcher he must have taken part in a lot of black market operations and most post war higher ups or councilors and representatives in his zone must have used his services in a way or another during the war, to sell the meat they produced on their farms or to buy the meat they could not have with the food coupons. But that lack of precision is already in the book. But a little bit of research on such a point, and others, would have made the film even more believable. The man Hannibal Lecter, and his psychology are really clarified. He was traumatized by what he went through and he never managed to get out of it, to forget it, to forgive the criminals, etc. But is a man that resilient to be able to forgive and forget seeing his own younger sister being cooked in her own copper bathtub and then eaten by a bunch of wild human beasts? I guess we would like to think so. But what we are sure of is that no matter how much you forget something, that thing remains in your mind and can manipulate you any time anywhere unconsciously. All people who suffer such traumas do not become criminals but most of them have some blank moments and their general attitude is either one of distantiation or one of extreme orthodoxy along some ethical or ideological line. For example we have not really thought of the impact of the torturing and execution of the early Christians on the very corpus of their beliefs and principles. How can some persecuted group defend the principle of loving their enemies who are putting them to death in atrocious ways everyday?  That is what this film is all about and it shows how relentless the victim of such violence can become, and that is not vengeance. It is justice in the eye of plain humanity, in the eye of what they have suffered, in the eye of God even. But the good question remains to know where the police, or more generally the forces that are supposed to defend law, order, justice, freedom and many other principles, were at the time of the crimes. No one can answer even when one war criminal of that type is caught up like Papon in France who was tried in the late 1990s for crimes against humanity he committed in Bordeaux in 1944 after a complete career in the top administration or the government of the country. He was the police and the direct representative of the state in Bordeaux hence law and order in 1944. The problem we have to solve is then what do we do for these people who suffered such horrible crimes after the end of the period concerned. What do we do with the victims of the war in Iraq, both American GIs who come back completely disturbed and Iraqis who are going to be haunted by what they suffered for decades. There is no easy answer to that question.

Call it ""Young Hannibal"", ""Hannibal Boring"", or---Hey---Hannibal was Cannibal, when Cannibal wasn't cool---whatever you call it, this slow yellow busride on the flesh-chomping Wayback Machine proposes to jump back into the murky Lithuanian past of everyone's famous little killer shrink: Little Hannibal Lecter.

Left alone in the Gothic schoolroom of his parent's ancient, moldering castle in the woods north of Vilnius, Little Hannibal looks at the little food pyramid chart hanging up on the wall.

""YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT"" it says.

Little Hannibal frowns. Later at dinner at the long table in the ancient Dining Hall, Hannibal stares at his plate: some venison with a cranberry glaize. Some boiled, chopped carrots. A slab of whitefish. Peas. Leafy greens. He looks up at Mommy Lecter.

""Mummy, am I a carrot?"" he asks. ""No darling.""

""A pea?"" Not at all my sweet.

""A potato?"" I think not. ""A little deer?"" Absolutely not, my darling Hannibal.

""Then what am I, Mummy?"" the little boy wails, in a fit of bewilderment.

""Why my sweet, sweet child, you're a little boy. You're a human being, Hannibal.""

The rest, as they say, is history, which should also have described this movie's fate in pre-production.

SHORT REVIEW, or, WHADDYU GUYS WANT AS AN APPETIZER?: Avoid. Plays out like Hitler Week on the History channel, only with People-Eating! I mean, honest to God, how do you make a movie about a serial killer cannibal psychiatrist boring? Ask director Peter Webber, he did it.

LONG REVIEW, or, PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO EAT PEOPLE, ARE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. The little nihlist spin Jon Demme gave ""The Phantom of the Opera"" could be summarized in three words: nasty, shocking, evil. When I first saw it, for a few weeks I recommended it be burned. The effect of that chicken-skin netherworld of inky-black grue was like standing in a meat locker and having a spitting black electric eel, its skin still slick with tepid water, dumped down your pants.

""Silence of the Lambs"" felt like pure Evil because it was meant to: it was a bleak nightworld highway of Hell with no offramps. The audience was dumped into a world where sanity stood on its head. Hannibal Lecter, society psychiatrist, was the very epitome of that film's brutal wrongness: a finely concocted, meticulously educated, disarmingly sophisticated monster whose refinement only serves as a pressure cooker for the ferocity and savagery lurking just within the urbane exterior.

Take any two minutes of grandmaster Anthony Hopkins's performance: it practically bristles a perfectly modulated, barely contained menace.

That menace---that sense of a hinged trapped set to spring on naught but a muscle tremor---is totally absent in ""Hannibal Rising"": Young Sherlock Hannibal (French actor Gaspard Ulliel, who probably does a fine job when he's talking Frog) bristles with all the menace of a cow-eyed virgin schoolboy visiting Europe for the first time. The only time Ulliel really rises to the occasion is when he gets all jiggy with a samurai mask and sword. And then, only for a moment.

And it's really not even poor Mr. Ulliel's fault that ""Hannibal Boring"" struggles to breathe and dies on the slab: more than anything it's the flick's whole schizophrenic struggle to humanize a guy who likes nothing better than a little Homo Sapiens pate with his champagne breakfest. Hey, who are we to judge! The SS ate his sister! Imagine what a little kidney-biting could have done for Schindler's List!

Nor can you blame the screenwriter for the flaccid storyline: lay that at writer Thomas Harris's door, an author who hasn't had magic in his typewriter since, well, ever. Harris's backstory to his foodie supervillain was: Hannibal, budding Lithuanian aristocrat, has to deal with World War 2! Hannibal loses baby sister to some fascists with, uhm, diverse palates! Hannibal makes it through, baby! Hannibal gets even, along with a nice first edition copy of Julia Child's ""Joy of Cooking"".

At the end of the day, though, ""Hannibal Sleeping"" fails because it spends all its time answering the most tiresome question of our dull Age: ""Why"". Asking ""Why?"" is a nice long drive up Nowhere Lane. Why did the big bad man capture a schoolbus full of little kids, cut them up into a million pieces, and airmail all the parts to Guam?

Why is pointless: why not? (the central question in ""Silence of the Lambs"") is far more amusing. Why does there need to be a why? Sexuality leads us to the precipice from which we may view the futility of the question, where why is buried beneath thrashy seconds, minutes, hours, days of sweaty insanity and pheremonal depravity.

Why? Because it feels good, Clarisse.

Which can't be said of this flop. ""Hannibal Rising"" is zero red meat and lots of tofu, sprouts, and sushsi: fifteen minutes later and you'll be hungry again.

1599317,2,B00005JPKW,"This movie is a prequel to Silence of the Lambs.  I love the whole series and the diabolical character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, M.D..  This film, however, is the very weakest of them.  It was beautifully filmed, however, it just didn't do it for me, I can't really explain why.  Maybe because it was more like a war movie or the great Anthony Hopkins was not in it.  However, this was about the young Lecter, so Hopkins, couldn't have been in it.  The surround sound was unbelievable and during the war scenes, I heard gun fire and explosions from everywhere, like I was there.

The movie does give us a glimpse of why Hannibal turned out the way he did.  His parents were wiped out by the Nazis during World War II and his young sister (Misha) killed and eaten by starving soldiers.  He was the only member of his family to survive and he received no mental counseling.  Hannibal grows up to seek revenge on all those involved with Misha's death.

A friend of mine, CLINT BRONSON, placed a comment on one of my reviews, Red Dragon (a great film in the Hannibal Lecter series) that stated, ""These are movies that are great for school bullies to watch. For they pick on a kid who is weaker or a nerd. But the kid grows up! And likes knives and never forgives!""  I didn't know what he meant at the time and questioned the comment, but he should have told me to watch this movie and that would explain.  I must apologize CLINT, for not understanding your comment.  For this truly is a movie for school bullies to watch.  Hannibal does get revenge on those who wronged him and his family.

1599318,2,B00005JPKW,"*SPOILERS*

So just how does one go from being a carefree, apple-cheeked schoolboy to becoming the most notorious, cannibalistic serial killer in literary history?  ""Hannibal Rising"" thinks it has the answer.  First, you watch as Nazis mow down your parents in cold blood.  Then, you look on helplessly as a band of starving Lithuanian soldiers carve up and eat your little sister.  Finally, you enroll in med school so you will not only acquire intimate knowledge of the human anatomy but will have unlimited access to disemboweled cadavers and tools of dismemberment that will come in mighty handy in your off-duty hours.

The very concept of Hannibal Lecter is so off-putting and distasteful (pardon the pun) that it really only works when you have an actor of the caliber of Anthony Hopkins on hand to, in some way at least, ""humanize"" the character.  For without the ""charisma"" Hopkins brought to the role, Lecter becomes just another garden-variety psycho - and the movies themselves mere exercises in cheap, tawdry exploitation.

This is the single greatest problem with this alleged ""prequel"" to the Academy Award-winning ""Silence of the Lambs.""  Hard as it tries, it really can't make Lecter's transformation all that compelling or believable.  And without that shield to protect us, the goriness and unpleasantness come rushing over us with full, unabated force.  Admittedly, there`s a certain purgative kick in watching the cannibals get their comeuppance at the hand of one of their victims, but you`ll still probably feel like taking a shower after the movie.  About the only interesting aspect to the story is how each of the three main characters has chosen a different way to cope with the loss of family members in the war:  Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel), of course, turns to revenge murders and cannibalism; the chief inspector (Dominic West) goes after unpunished war criminals; and Lecter's beautiful Japanese aunt (Li Gong) helps protect her nephew from the full force of the law.  But such analysis is going way too far in justifying a movie whose sole purpose for existing is to turn the audience's stomach as it caters to the propensity for vicarious sadism that resides in the human species.

Those who made ""Hannibal Rising"" have taken a character who was terrifying precisely because his actions COULDN'T be explained in any rational manner - and thus any one of us could fall victim to his madness - and have turned him into a conventional Angel of Vengeance stamping out evildoers and injustice, with the imprimatur of ""divine righteousness"" to give him moral cover.  In short, they have transmogrified him into little more than a comic book action figure (albeit an extremely dark one).  Not that it`s any big deal in the grand scheme of things, but ""Hannibal Rising"" might be more accurately entitled ""Hannibal Falling.""",1192320000,2,2845,5.044871794871795

What I got instead was more of a simple revenge story than the character study. Oh, yeah, we do learn some background of the famous ""Dr. Lector,"" but not enough of what really made him the weird combination of intellectual and cannibal.

Although portraying and having someone in the film label the young adult as ""monster,"" the filmmakers (actually, author Thomas Harris) really made him more of a sympathetic character instead. They took the easiest road, out, too, making an easy target the villains: the Nazis. How often has Hollywood done that, even today 60 years after the conclusion of WWII. What we get is a revenge story of how Lector went from a child captive of the Nazis for a short time, to a medical student in Paris and how he tracked down the Nazis who killed the rest of his family.

The best part of the film was the absolutely gorgeous cinematography. This is beautifully filmed, first frame to last.

Didn't the excellent ""Red Dragon"" reveal enough of Lecter's backstory?  Was going back further going to do anything other than take away the air of mystery to the character?

  Fortunately, ""Hannibal Rising"" only deepens the impact of the character and his previous films.  Beginning in World War II Lithuania, we see the deaths of young Lecter's family, not at the hands of Hannibal  himself, but by Nazis and a band of marauding Lithuanian ex-Nazi collaborators/turned 'freelance' looters and terrorizers.  Through a ghastly set of circumstances best left to be seen in the movie itself, the surviving Hannibal is found by the Russian forces moving in at the end of the war, a mute child wandering through the woods with a chain around his neck.  Raised in a Soviet orphanage, the amnesiac and still-mute Hannibal seemingly develops into an unlikely defender of the oppressed  (""You go against the way of nature, Hannibal"", an orphanage official tells him, ""Always hurting the bully""), Lecter eventually frees himself and makes his way across Europe to the residence of some disrant relatives, where the bulk of the movie takes place.  The older but still mute Hannibal (played by Gaspard Ulliel in the male breakout performance of the year so far) is cared for by the widow (Gong Li, another great performance in a highly well-acted movie) of his deceased uncle, later becoming more deeply involved with her.

  It's upon regaining his memory of the events in the war that the transformation really begins.  The bloody path of Hannibal Lecter as we know him begins as revenge, but as we already know from the previous movies, it doesn't end there.  Hannibal ends up travelling from innocent child to a dark, violent avenger, to what he is when ""Red Dragon"" takes place (although ""Hannibal Rising"" wraps up many years before Dragon commences - maybe we haven't seen the last of the pre-Anthony Hopkins Hannibal).  As the end of Hannibal Rising nears, it enters extreme territory that makes the legendary 'banquet' scene from 2001's ""Hannibal"" look like a tranquil countryside brunch.

  *WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD*

  In ways, we see Hannibal Lecter die twice in this movie.  The first is in the World War II Lithuanian winter, where the little boy effectively ceases to be, and begins the path to his new incarnation as a passion-driven dark avenger.  The second death though, the passing from avenger to psychopath, could be considered to be a metaphorical suicide (as opposed to the way his days as a happy child were 'murdered' when his family's lives were taken).  What drives Lecter to this point - and the violence with which this path begins: the death of one of the last surviving members of his family's killers, in a fashion so savage and shocking it outdoes anything in the previous three Lecter movies; makes his dispatching of previous guilty parties seem tame; and is enough to floor even the seasoned horror fan - is the kind of thing to stay with one, to haunt you long after the movie is over.  And with it the evil, fully-formed Hannibal Lecter, is truly risen.  Great stuff, managing to be on par with Anthony Hopkins's Lecter movies.",1188864000,2,3492,4.831649831649831

Where this version of how the child Hannibal became the crazed and bizarre man due to his witnessing the loss of his young sister to the appetites of hungry soldiers is less successful than the studies of the grown man is the lack of including the genius mind, epicurean stance, highly sophisticated art lover, and macabre sense of human relationships as shown in the boy to young man period.

Filmed in beautiful color and atmosphere the story begins in WW II as stated above and as Hannibal the lad escapes the carnivorous appetites of the Nazi solders (including the evil Grutas as portrayed with gusto by Rhys Ifans!) and becomes Hannibal the young man (Gaspard Ulliel) who with the aid of his aunt Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li) continues to search out all of the soldiers who ate his sister.  And in the end we do discover some hidden secrets about the now mature Hannibal Lecter.

Director Peter Webber keeps the pace and the gore going and has at his side a fine supporting cast (Richard Brake, Kevin McKidd, Stephen Walters,  Ivan Marevich, and Goran Kostic among others).  Ulliel is credible in the minimal dialog is given and it probably is the fault of Thomas Harris that this young Hannibal doesn't show all the key characteristics he will eventually flaunt.

After being introduced to Anthony Hopkins in the Hannibal series, fans now get an end cap with the origin of the character.  With WWII raging on in the background I found that there were some very plausible scenes with this film.

It is sometimes hard to connect it with Hannibal of old, because I am so used to the other films like Silence of the Lambs as well as Red Dragon, which really captured a scary mood within the character of Hannibal.  This does that as well but because the origin was so long in getting here, for some reason it feels very disjointed from the others.  That should not be a negative though, everything is introduced to show how Hannibal became who he was, although I sometimes think people like this are kind of wired that way and not just consumed with actions that are results of traumatic childhood experiences.

I suppose you could attempt to view the movie as an isolated incident, a self-contained story, but that would be both wrong-headed and, for anyone who knows anything about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, virtually impossible.  Besides, even if you could take away expectations and biases from the viewing experience, you still end up with a pretty watered down treatise on what makes a monster.

Much like Showtime's deliciously dark series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexter/dp/B000Q6GUW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexter</a>, ""Hannibal Rising"" hopes to show us how serial killers are born.  Their answers aren't that different: a mind-boggingly horrific childhood experience combined with the tutelage of a fighting/killing master.  Dexter's seemed a bit more plausible -- he was adopted by a police officer who sagely tried to channel Dexter's murderous tendencies into more productive veins; Hannibal, on the other hand, is taken under the wing of his obscenely wealthy Aunt, Lady Murasaki, a sexy Japanese immigrant who teaches Hannibal the arts of sword play and flower arranging and why it's okay to make out with your aunt if she's only a relative by marriage.  Also, her chef gives Hannibal lots of great cooking advice.  ""The cheeks are the best part of an animal!""  Hannibal does not have to ask which cheeks the chef is talking about; I would've.

Hannibal's childhood trauma involves the grisly death of his sister at the hands of war profiteering Lithuanians.  The rest of the movie follows Hannibal as he exacts his vengance on these men, who are still pretty bad guys.  I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say this: it's a prequel, so if you're guessing that Hannibal gets away scott free, you're on the right track.

Under normal circumstances, I'd be compelled to give a movie like this three stars instead of two, but ""Hannibal Rising"" does such a thorough job of squeezing all of the sick mystery out of the character of Lecter that I found the whole experience rather patronizing.  Part of what makes Lecter such a fabulous anti-hero is that he is essentially unknowable.  The darkest and most disturbing element of his personality isn't his amazing intelligence, his erudite charm, or his transcedentally creepy calm.  It is the fact that his reasons are his own to know, and only for us to guess at.

""Hannibal Rising"" not only removes the mystique from the man, but it also reduces his actions to those of sullen kid.  Hannibal is not the anti-hero in this movie; he's the actual, legitimate hero, and the label doesn't suit the character, at least not as he's ever been portrayed in any other film.  It turns him into a puppet that's holding its own strings.  Even worse, the film insultingly holds the audiences hands through some of its weightier images.  When Hannibal passes through an open-air butcher market or when he sees a bracelet that his sister used to wear, we are treated to flashbacks of Hannibal's last moments with his sister, as if we can't already guess on our own the connections to be made.

The closest thing to Foster's Clarice here is Inspector Popil, a man smart enough to know that Hannibal is responsible for the sudden outbreak of beheadings and cheek eatings.  The victim of his own fair share of war crimes, Popil even sympathizes with what makes Hannibal kill, but he has, of course, chosen the path of law and order.  Hannibal respected Clarice's weaknesses as they could be found in the virtues she chose to valiantly uphold.  That respect is missing here, and so the character of Popil remains woefully unused, his status relegated to that of a narrative mouthpiece.  ""That young boy died out there with his sister,"" Popil says.  ""What came out of that woods was no longer human.  It was ... a monster!""

If you say so.  Gaspard Ulliel's portrayal of Hannibal does have hints of ""monster"" about it, but it lacks depth and coherency.  He spends much of the movie grinning quietly and looking at people out of the corners of his eyes.  It's all well and good, I suppose, but you'll get the impression that something's missing.  What's missing is the uncertainty, the creepiness, the indefinable menace that made the man such a great character.  It's been said that we hate most the things we understand least; Hannibal's not hard to figure out in this film.  I guess it's fair to say that that doesn't necessarily make it a hate-worthy film, but it does make it boring.",1184630400,2,5030,5.276381909547739

Having reviewed the ""novel""  (actually a poorly written novelization of the movie script) a few weeks back, I decided to rent the movie on cable.  First of all, not a single scene after the first twenty minutes or so (the Soviet and German combat) was even remotely plausable. Hannibal is able to  track down and kill the killers of his sister because one of them just happens to be an intelligence officer in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic  who just happens to be alerted that Hannibal is in Lithuania, and who just happens to find Hannibal on the grounds of his family's estate- Hannibal somehow manages to walk freely around all kinds of interesting area in the Police State of the Soviet Union.

The film started off well, family fleeing Nazi occupation holding up in forest retreat until it gets stormed by renegade soldiers (wont go into what happens next as it will ruin the plot)  The film though when he gets to his teens just goes down hill I mean this is cold war time how the hell did he just march across the whole of Poland, up to Germany, hop over the border and get into France?  How the hell did he find this long lost relative based on an old photo and a couple of names I mean for Gods sake we are talking about someone who probably would not have spoken a word of French and even if he did would have been noticed as a foreigner at once.

It doesn't improve, his Japanese aunt who when isn't teaching him the ways of the Samurai (as 'all' Japanese people know, Yawn!) Is riding around the town in the dead of night in a sexy leather cat suit!  Yep this is post war France! Yep I did say leather cat suit!

Then we come to his revenge, again he has a remarkable knack of crossing cold war borders without problem and the fear factor, it just isn't here with this actor no matter how much he tries.

1599490,2,B00005JPKW,"In the history of cinema there are many great cinematic villains that have terrified movie audiences over the years. Often times they are frightening in appearance or deeds, sometimes they are misunderstood or victims of circumstance, and they can even be so captivating that you can't help but pay attention to their many evil acts. These great villains range from the dreaded Darth Vader, to the slashers known as Freddy, Jason, and Leatherface, or the brilliant evil genius' of the James Bond films, to the most feared psychological villain of all time, Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter. Moviemakers lately have felt the need to explain the origins to some of cinema's classic villains from George Lucas' prequel trilogy of 'Star Wars' films, to Leatherface's lackluster origin story in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"", the most recent addition to the list of villains getting the origin treatment would be Hannibal Lecter in the Weinstein Company's adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel, ""Hannibal Rising"".

""Hannibal Rising"" is the origin story of Hannibal Lecter, showing how he went from being an innocent young boy in Lithuania to society's most deadly, cannibalistic serial killer. As a young boy in Lithuania, Hannibal witnessed the deaths of his parents in World War 2, leaving he and his sister Mischa to fend for themselves. Just when Hannibal thought things couldn't get worse, a group of militia men invade their home, taking Hannibal and Mischa hostage. Soon, food begins to become sparse, and the militia gets desperate and chooses to survive by taking Mischa's life for food. Some time after that, grown up and in college, Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel), is mastering every course he takes, and well on his way to earning his doctorate. Little does his professors know that Hannibal hides a dark, deadly secret. In his own time he is obsessively pursuing the men that formed the militia that took his sister's life, and if there's one thing Hannibal intends to do when he finds them, it's take his pound of flesh for their crime.

The decision to make a prequel to the popular Hannibal Lecter trilogy of films seemed like a waste of time and space, simply a way for the studio to just cash in on the character's well-known name. Which left me feeling like this would be a pathetic movie, because more than likely not a single person associated with the previous films would be involved, and for the most part I was right on that count, but there was a glimmer of a chance that this movie would be more than expected. Shortly after the film was greenlit, it was announced that the movie was being written by none other than Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal Lecter, based on his novel of the same name that he was in the process of finishing up. With that prospect, I thought that ""Hannibal Rising"" (at the time the movie was being called ""Young Hannibal"") just may stand a chance of equaling its predecessors in terms of quality storytelling and acting that is among the best Hollywood has to offer.

Well, as good of a writer Thomas Harris is, or I should say was (his other three books in the Lecter series are great works of fiction), this novel and the screenplay that was based on it are far inferior to anything offered in the other installments. I was disappointed by the movie for several reasons; first I felt the actor chosen to portray young Hannibal was only okay. I understand he was trying to only give hints as to what this character will become later on, and I'll give it to the actor, there were a couple of times that I saw a glimpse of Anthony Hopkins' creepy portrayal seep in, but these were few and far between. For the most part the actor was just flat in his performance and apparently the only expression he really knew how to make was a snarl, he didn't really have any of the nuances that Anthony perfected in this character. Second, it seemed like Hannibal took to cannibalism a little too easily. I understand that he saw his sister suffer at the hands of evil militia men, and seeing that would definitely scar a young child, but when he kills the first soldier and commits his first act of cannibalism, there is no uncertainty or disdain for what he's doing. He simply does the deed, doesn't appear to be bothered by it, in fact he may even have enjoyed it (the movie really doesn't explain this), and moves on in search of the next victim on his list. Which brings me to my third problem with this movie; aside from revenge being his motive for killing the killers of his sister, he doesn't show any further conviction to commit murder. Leaving one to wonder why he continued after achieving his vengeance, did committing all those acts of murder and cannibalism become such an obsession for him outside of revenge that he just felt compelled to do more or what? This was an aspect that wasn't explained, and I felt should have been, especially since this was to be the origin of his evil life and a deep psychological profile into the why of his life of crime. Instead, Thomas Harris' screenplay and novel barely scratched the surface, no doubt because the Weinstein's are hoping to cash in on further installments of prequels, since Hopkins is probably through portraying the character. And my final complaint would have to be that there was no cameo by Anthony Hopkins, the least they could have done was bring him in during the final moments of the film to link it in to the other three. Instead, he gets his revenge, the story ends, and the credits roll. Nothing linking it in to the other films, aside from the name of the lead character.

""Hannibal Rising"" is not the worst film ever made, it's actually an average movie, and if it was the first in the series to be made, it may have seemed better, but when comparing it to the other three already in the franchise, it pales in comparison. The other movies contained many psychological aspects to them, especially ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""Red Dragon"" and ""Hannibal"" did to an extent just not as much, but this film didn't contain any. There was potential, especially given that Hannibal endured a horrific childhood which is the root of his evil, but aside from a few dream sequences we don't get much insight into his character, and the dreams only serve to show us exactly what the militia did to him and his sister. Which is probably where the biggest problem of this film lies, is that in trying to explain why Hannibal is who he is, the makers of the film try to make the audience feel sympathy for him. This is one of modern cinema's greatest movie villains, I don't want to feel sorry for him, I want to see what made him who he is. The filmmakers tried to accomplish the why of the character, but went about it wrong, all they explained was why he was killing the militia, it never explained why he felt the need to continue killing other people that weren't involved in his sister's death. So, because of that the audience feels that his killing is justified, at least in this movie (it's just a really sick brand of justice), and in doing so you sympathize with him. What this all boils down to is that the filmmakers, especially Thomas Harris, really dropped the ball on explaining the origin of Hannibal Lecter, opting simply to give audiences an average revenge tale, just a little gorier than most.

1599491,4,B00005JPKW,"Hannibal Rising suffered severely at the box office because it was implied in the trailers that we'd mainly see a young Hannibal Lecter slashing up the countryside.

At the end of May, Hannibal Rising gets released on DVD and the memory of the slash-'em-up trailer is still in my head, so I'm not compelled to see it, but 4 weeks later I finally do. And it turns out to be one of the better movies that I've seen this year.

Funny though...I'm not sure that I'd have appreciated Hannibal Rising as much without first seeing 1991's Silence of the Lambs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;. Oh, it certainly isn't necessary to see Silence of the Lambs prior to seeing Hannibal Rising. Ironically, seeing Lambs before seeing this prequel just puts a better perspective on the things to come as you watch Lecter in his early years. It did for me anyway.

In Silence of the Lambs you fear Lecter and what he'll do next. In Hannibal Rising you actually find yourself rooting for him with a kind of sympathy. Hannibal Rising is more a story of revenge than it is a story about a serial killer...kind of like a Rambo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Blood-Special-Edition/dp/B0000640S1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Blood (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;with class.

In Hannibal Rising, you get a great directorial from little known Peter Webber and a terrific performance out of mostly French film actor Gaspard Ulliel. In the beginning sequence Webber went a little overboard with getting us to believe that those who committed the atrocities that ultimately turned Lecter into what he bacame would all be so unified in the decision to commit the atrocities. But the movie really is done well overall and Ulliel played a masterfully diabolical young Hannibal Lecter.

So forget that the movie poster and DVD cover have a picture of Lecter in what looks like that this'll-prevent-you-from-bitng-me mask (turns out that's not what it is at all). And forget that the trailers showed mainly a young, sinister looking Hannibal Lecter as if about to cut someone open. Hannibal Rising ultimately is less gory than you probably think it will be, and less gory than 2001's Hannibal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannibal/dp/B00003CXSP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannibal</a>&nbsp;.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that Hannibal Rising is a classic, as Silence of the Lambs was, but it's very good. Fans of Lambs should take a chance with Hannibal Rising.

The missing story in the Lecter chronicles is his doings in the US leading up to his capture by FBI Agent Will Graham (between Hannibal Rising and Red Dragon). Can't wait.",1182988800,6,3628,6.30241935483871
1599492,3,B00005JPKW,"I just got done watching ""Hannibal Rising"" this evening. Hmmmm, not sure what to make of it! I've read and seen ""Red Dragon"" (which I loved by the way), ""Silence of the Lambs"", & ""Hannibal""....

After reading many negative reviews for both the book and movie versions of ""Hannibal Rising"", I wasn't sure if I wanted anything to do with the book or the movie.... However, decided to watch the movie for myself and form my own opinion.

Honestly, I don't think ""Hannibal Rising"" is as bad as everyone has made it out to be. It is suppose to be a prequel, giving us the idea of why Hannibal is the way he is as an adult. I thought ""Hannibal Rising"" was suspenseful and well acted by the cast members. We see Hannibal as a monster out for revenge for those who killed his younger sister. This is where Hannibal begins to learn and refine his murderous appetite that we later refined when he becomes an adult..... What starts out as revenge turns into gruesome psychopathic behavior.",1182816000,,978,4.519774011299435

1599534,5,B00005JPKW,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film was able to meet the high standard of quality that Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, and Hannibal all achieved previously.  Although we do not find Anthony Hopkins anywhere in this romp through Europe, Gaspard Ulliel manages to characterize Thomas Harris' Lecter perfectly.  This little-known, handsome young Frenchman has just the right accent and mannerisms that capture the enigmatic Lecter which Hopkins created in the series. Overall this is a great movie, well shot, and nice performances by Gong Li and Dominic West as well. Hopefully we can steal Ulliel from France and see him in more English language films in the future.",1182297600,2,681,5.071428571428571
1599535,3,B00005JPKW,"Hannibal Rising can best be described as disturbing, gruesome and totally insane. It's also well made and creepy. Gaspard Ulliel plays Hannibal Lector who wants revenge on starving soldiers who ate his little sister right in front of him when he was young. Once he starts killing he starts to enjoy it a little too much.

  The movie plays a little like Batman Begins. He gets some training in the way of the sword. Then all of a sudden he's ready to be a killer and it comes easy to him. ""Spoiler"", he kills a guy that disrepects a woman he has feelings for. She's even a bit out there, she acts as if receiving the head is like getting a dosen roses and says ""you shouldn't have done this for me"".

  Things like that are a bit silly but Gaspard Ulliel still does a good job carrying the movie as Hannibal Lector even if he is no Anthony Hopkins. His expressions basically make his performance though. He has fun in the movie playing Hannibal and throwing out one-liners here and there. But I doubt viewers will have as much of a good time with all the over the top violence. So for that I can only mildly recommend this movie. Also eventhough Gaspard faired well as Hannibal, I rather see Anthony Hopkins back one more time to make a better movie than Hannibal.

The Hannibal character in this film/story was much too far along in age... was he six, or seven?... to have been vulnerable to the mind-warping machinations which produce psychopathic behavior toward others.  It was attempted in the story to show that he had no feelings, as when he registered nothing on the lie-detector test, and the French police detective said that the ""human"" part of Lecter had died in the snow, when he was found by Russian soldiers.

It's feasible that the character would want revenge for seeing his sister murdered and cannibalized, but ordinarily that would not make him demented toward other people... not to the extent that one becomes a regular serial killer.

I think Thomas Harris dropped the ball with his Hannibal origins.  His book ""Red Dragon"" was actually the best tale in the series, with the best plot and characterization.  The rest has been entertaining, but the rest has all lacked the same depth as the book ""Red Dragon"" exhibited.",1182038400,2,1085,4.966850828729282

Hannibal Rising is a prequel to everything else we've seen our favorite cannibal in, and upon viewing it you may wish you hadn't.  If you read Thomas Harris' Hannibal novel, then you'll probably remember the brief glimpse of backstory given to Hannibal Lecter's (Gaspard Ulliel) origin, of which this prequel capatilizes on.  As we witness the atrocities performed on Lecter and his family, we see the boy grow towards adulthood with revenge on his mind, and who can blame him really?  What kills Hannibal Rising is that Lecter isn't frightening at all throughout the film.  What helped make Silence of the Lambs so good, and to a degree Red Dragon (I wasn't fond of Ridley Scott's Hannibal at all) is that Lecter was a frightening, and brilliant, psychopath who became one of the most memorable screen villians of all time.  Here, he's relegated to a sympathetic state, and it doesn't work.  Not to mention that to say that Gaspard Ulliel doesn't fit the role is saying it lightly, and the rest of an otherwise solid cast (including Gong Li, Kevin McKidd, and Dominic West) are pretty much wasted in their roles.  Peter Webber's direction, while stylish, is ultimately empty, and a majority of the film plays out like an overlong slasher.  While there are a good amount of creepy moments and some solid, grisly effects, Hannibal Rising is a dud, and hopefully, the means to an end for a franchise that has been picked clean.",1182038400,2,1506,4.739463601532567

A mish-mash of quasi Nazi-Asian ancestor worship/revenge was a witless ploy in an attempt to build some sort of  plot. There is no backbone here, nothing to lead to the Hannibal we all know and love.

But if you can wrap your mind around the fact that there was no way they could have possibly gotten Anthony to play a 20 year old Hannibal... you'll be better off. No, it is not Silence of the Lambs. It is not Hannibal ""at his prime""... it is Hannibal -rising-. Why he became the way he became, and all that jazz. He was an extremely rage-filled kid and I thought it was very well acted frankly. It has a different feel from the other Hannibal movies.

People say this one ""drags"". I do not see how it is any less ""slow paced"" than Hannibal and certainly has better pacing than Red Dragon. We do not see a clever master mind here who never makes any mistakes, Hannibal hasn't had years to perfect his cold talent of killing and psychological warfare yet. However, there is something very geniunely creepy with how he is portrayed and acted in this movie. And it really is a horror story, if you try to see it with a realistic angle...

I reccomend it. It's different. It's not a happy story. It's not Anthony Hopkins, but that doesn't mean it's bad. If you're expecting Anthony's younger double in this, don't bother. The kid has his own style - and I think he did a very good job and came across as quite cold and tormented (I can't think of his name off the top of my head, unfortunately, as he is not a big name actor and thank God for that).",1181692800,5,1609,4.268852459016394

This film tries to explain WHY Hannibal became a serial killer, and espcially the reasoning behind his particular penchants. I will not go into detail (do not want to ruin anything), but I will say they did a great job showing his transformation and portraying how events that occur early-on in one's development truly affect the adult personality.

Gaspard Ulliel was fabulous in his role as the teenaged Hannibal- he is at the same time terrifying and loveable.

Fans of the earlier films will enjoy any number of visual references to ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" in particular.  But beyond that, we learn in this film what shaped Hannibal the human being as well as the monster, from his aristocratic bearing to his love of the culinary arts to, possibly, his preferences in headwear.

Things get sluggish at a few points and to my mind, the film could have been trimmed without losing any of its impact.

During captivity, Hannibal is exposed to the most abhorrent of all atrocities. He spends the remainder of the film wreaking vengeance on the men who so profoundly scarred him.

Lecter's behavior is violent and lurid throughout the film. Nonetheless, he is an avenging angel, albeit with a bizarre moral compass. This is more than can be said for the depraved people he targets.

I feel sorry for Hannibal; I sympathize for him. My feelings, however, did not begin with this film (I have not read the book), but with Hannibal, the previous book. The previous work briefly touched on his history and that his sister was eaten on the Eastern Front during World War II. Note that I preferred the book over the butchered (no pun intended) story that arrived onscreen. As a natural course, Hannibal Rising visits that dark place in Hannibal's life and emerges us, the audience, in his ordeal.

For Hannibal fans, everything comes full circle. Now we know how and why. I see this film as an inspiring art form. The total vision, from story, production, to acting, is unique and fresh, in a dark way. It also helps greatly that Thomas Harris wrote the screenplay.

Coming and going like the tide is an interesting French investigator whose character is never really developed. That's unfortunate. Not only does it deny audiences a glimpse of how he too lost his family, the lack of his regular presence makes Hannibal appear WAY above the law.

The antagonists really put up little argument when Hannibal kills them, one at a time. With the exception of a lucky glimpse by a maid, Hannibal has no trouble whatsoever killing everyone in a quick, expedient fashion. Can you say, a little too mechanical?

Now a film about the beginning of another famous character arrives, telling us how Hannibal `Cannibal' Lector succumbed to the dark side of human nature, and became one of the world's notorious killers. Sadly ""Hannibal Rising,"" which looks like a typical revenge story, wouldn't tell us much about it except that two females played important roles in his younger days.

Not that ""Hannibal Rising"" is a bad film. The film, which begins with young boy Hannibal's harrowing experiences during the WW2, is competently done as long as its acting, production designs and cinematography are concerned. French Gaspard Ulliel may not be the most credible Hannibal after watching Welsh Anthony Hopkins or Scottish Brian Cox playing the same role, but Ulliel's Hannibal is creepy enough to convince us of his future as `Cannibal' Lector. Rhys Ifans is also great as a ruthless kingpin with sadistic traits.

However, the script written by Thomas Harris himself has nothing truly intriguing about it except the some gruesome killings by ever-resourceful Hannibal. The film has little to say about his inner self expect two marginally interesting things: frequent flashbacks about Hannibal's younger sister, and the relations with Hannibal's aunt Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). As to the former one, things can be easily detected. As to the latter, it is yet again clich&eacute;d images of the Orient with the name of Lady Murasaki borrowed from the classic Japanese literature ""Diary of Lady Murasaki"" in the eleventh century. I like Gong Li and I admit her beauty and huge acting talent (see her films made in China ... any of them), but her roles is not substantial enough like the borrowed name of a classic.

""Hannibal Rising"" is an OK revenge story with familiar scenes where `bad guys' are given brief moment to talk in triumph before the vengeful protagonist when he should shoot him first. You will find many familiar plot devices such as humiliating school ward or a big boat in the canal. The difference is painful tortures and bloody deaths, which you can see here a lot.

The events and characters are very inventive, the ""coolness"" factor permeates everything (eg: he goes to medical school, and is also secretly a martial arts expert and murderer... how cool is that?), and it's generally a neat movie. Hannibal's character tends to come across as a superhero turned supervillian, a la comic book, and the character development is very convincing. When I saw this movie in the theater, it definitely seemed to arouse in the audience a sense of excitement and energetic anticipation, as most movies that start out really well do.

However, that anticipation was greatly disappointed by the last third or so of the movie. At that point everything happens exactly as you'd expect. The audience is already expected to know that Hannibal becomes a sociopathic cannibalistic murderer, so I won't be spoiling much when I say that the third half is just Hannibal killing people. He goes, he kills the people he's expected to kill, and that's it. The inventiveness of the first part of the movie disappears and everything just sort of happens in the most unimaginative way possible. No more plot twists, no more surprises, nothing interesting or new introduced, no further character investigation... So in the end this movie, though it starts out very well, degenerates into mediocrity.",1176249600,4,1825,5.06312292358804

Some people like that kind of explanation for bad behavior. Just don't forget the talent put into bringing young Hannibal to life. Gaspard Ulliel is completely believeable that he could age into Anthony Hopkins' version of Hannibal. And don't miss Gong Li's performance OR the cat-and-mouse of Hannibal's interaction with the Inspector.

1599743,5,B00005JPKW,"Surprisingly, I actually liked this movie. Don't get me wrong it's not something I care to see over and over again, but I think it set the basis for Hannibal Lector fairly. Sometimes, it does kinda get on my nerves that they'll make a movie with 30 different sequels, and then try to take you back to the beginning and show you how it all started. With that being said, some of them are really good, and this is one. I think people are unfairly comparing Gaspard Ulliel to Anthony Hopkins when really there should be no comparison. Gaspard is playing a much younger Hannibal who hasn't grown in age yet, and it's his job to set the stage for the story we all know and love. Which he did do it justice, I might add. I guess since he's an unknown face to the American audience, and he's just now being introduced into a movie portraying a character of this magnitude the comparions were envitable. At any rate,  Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of Hannibal actually takes place many years later when he's much older which should be taken into account. What I like about this movie is that even though cannabalism is a morbid, nasty, and extremely disgusting thought for a sane person. I'm glad to say that's really not the way they portrayed it in this movie. It wasn't done deliberately with the intention of making the audience puke by showing us Hannibal actually eating somebody's flesh, eyeballs, or brains out of their head while they're still alive. It also wasn't way over the top with the blood and gore for no reason like most films these days. I guess that's why a lot of people complain that it's boring, because they didn't get to see somebody's guts or intestines exposed. This movie shows you how Hannibal became the psychological, cannabalistic, monster that he is today. They show you that he's a regular human being that was driven to cannabalism through hurt and the need for revenge after his little sister was eaten by a bunch of savages. I feel a little guilty, but I actually found myself rooting for Hannibal to get his revenge which disturbed me a little bit. Needless to say, I liked it, and I think that the ""Silence of the Lambs"" as well as the ""Manhunter"" and ""Red Dragon"" fans owe it to themselves to see this movie.

1599745,2,B00005JPKW,"Hannibal Rising (Peter Webber, 2007)

Now, I have to say, I watched a whole lot of movies this weekend. But still, you have to ask yourself: how memorable was Hannibal Rising if I forgot about it while listing out the movies I'd seen this weekend to review, and not remembered to add it to that list for over an hour?

Now, I'll admit that I'm judging this movie more harshly than I otherwise would because it's from the long-bleeding and damned-close-to-dead Hannibal franchise, but screenwriter Harris (adapting from his own novel) and director Webber (Girl with a Pearl Earring) really invite that sort of thing; there are little visual clues to the other movies littered throughout, including the infamous scene of a young Lecter (A Very Long Engagement's Gaspard Ulliel) trying on the bottom half of the samurai mask, which directly resembles the masked forced upon Anthony Hopkins in the Silence of the Lambs. Even that would be forgivable if the armor ever ended up being more than set decoration in this movie. But no-- it's there for the sole purpose of throwing the audience a biscuit. Really, what can you say to that?

Divorced from the mythology, it would probably be a serviceable little thriller, a kind of I Spit on Your Grave-lite. Lecter and his family are living in Lithuania in 1944-- not a very nice place to be, as the Germans and the Russians are about to collide on their doorstep. Eight-year-old Hannibal, his younger sister Mischa, and his mother and father, along with some servants, retreat to the country house just before the Germans, with some SS-wannabe tagalongs headed by Grutas (Danny Deckchair's Rhys Ifans), get to Lecter Castle and start murdering the help. Through various chains of coincidence, the surviving Lecters and Grutas' band both end up barricaded in the country house, where bad things happen, and Hannibal vows revenge. Yeah, you've heard it all a million times before. And it works, kind of, in the sense that you know what's coming within a few minutes of the opening (really, if you've seen the rest of the movies in the canon, you knew what was coming from the moment you first heard this movie was in production). In that respect, it's analogous to any of the Friday the 13th or Halloween sequels; you're looking forward to the next inventive death, rather than worrying about such details as plot, characterization, etc. All of which do exist here as a kind of thin veneer, so at least it ranks above any Friday the 13th after the second one.

One high point n the movie bears mentioning, though. I've been seeing more and more of Richard Brake (who here plays one of Grutas' underlings) recently, usually in really, really bad movies. But the more I see of the guy, the more I like him. He's wonderful at playing slime. One of these days, he's going to break out and become ""that guy you know, but can never remember his name,"" like William Fichtner. Be ready, you can say you knew him when.

Other than that, really, as long as you can turn your brain off for two hours and aren't terribly insulted by Harris' pandering, you'll have some fun with this. **",1173052800,2,3114,4.716911764705882
1599746,4,B00005JPKW,"In `Silence of the lambs' both Clarence Starling and Dr. Frederick Chilton desperately try to unravel the monster that is Hannibal Lector. While Chilton fretted over figuring out what made Hannibal tick to broker a book deal, Starling was all too busy trying to solve a crime while becoming emotionally attached to a psychopath. The enigma of Hannibal Lector is what drove that detective story. The sequel `Hannibal' is a pure tale of horror with Hannibal on the loose in society. Within the framework of that story one tempting revelation came to pass... that Hannibal had been through a traumatic World War II experience involving his family and starvation. Nothing could have been more deliciously tempting. Let's face it by the end of `Hannibal' it was the single most mouth-watering eye-opener into the Hannibal diagnosis since we learned that his pulse did not go above 72 while chewing on a nurse.

`Hannibal Rising' serves up the best dish yet. The whole movie is one big boiling frothing pot that feeds a Harris fan's ravenous need. For those who are interested, you will be licking the spoon and asking for more. Not only that but this movie is a whole new type of thriller. Who can accuse Harris of being uninspired and clichd? The risk of `Hannibal' is worth the experience of `Rising' and then some more. Harris should be commended for rattling our brains and stomach with suggestive images of a boiling child's bath tub while relating it to the horrific incident that is slowly revealed throughout the frames.

We get one most realistic depictions of a post-WWII France. Hannibal (a tremendously impressive Gaspard Ulliel), a young holocaust survivor of an all different type, has gaps in his memory and tries to remember the horrible thing that happened to him. Brought up and educated to higher than high standards, his only relation his Japanese aunt (Li Gong, a wonderful addition with Samaria swords and masks included!), the damaged child ferments between the cuts, encountering incidents that illuminate the darkness to reveal an evil so unsettling that drives him on to a type of shocking avenge operation for a motive that exposes you to a awfulness that you have never experienced before. This is a whole lot more than just flirting with the insane. This is exactly what intelligent horror should be. It might be Hannibal 4, but that does not mean it is not good. I thought it was one of the best sequels in recent memory. Not ""S.O.L.T"", but it can stand alone as a damn fine serial killer movie with plenty of brains to boot.",1172880000,10,2550,4.832951945080092

I believe what was dissapointing was that this was not as good as the origonal, but still a great follow up. If I had to pick a favorite part about this movie, it would be the final scene, as well as the one where. There are a lot of killing and decafitating of people's heads, as well as violence, but I still loved this movie. There are some parts that drag, mostly in the middle of the movie, but I still believe it is worth checking out.

1599799,4,B00005JPKW,"Hannibal Rising is a good, solid thriller. It tells a heartbreaking story of a boy whose parents were killed during WW2, his younger sister murdered and eaten by savage looters who were fighting neither for Russian army nor for German one but for themselves. After some years of wandering, growing up and finally finding a decent home he starts looking for those prowlers to kill them one by one in most brutal ways a viewer can only imagine. The story-line saves some twists for us along with all the necessary bloody and disturbing details. Sounds nice. But not if it's a story of a young Hannibal Lecter. So four stars go to this film as to a picture apart, not as to another segment of life of Dr. Lecter.

And it's not the fact that Hannibal Rising doesn't contain even 10 percent of psychological intensity of The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Jonathan Demme's film we were dazed and horrified by Dr. Lecter's evil ways. Such a monstrosity was always beyond our comprehension. We could just conjecture what his childhood had been like and how he had come to be such a villain as he was. Dr. Lecter's background and his psyche always remained a mystery to us. Usually people of this kind come from normal families, they have normal lives, and their small deviations are not seen untill the time comes. But here, in Hannibal Rising, everything is pretty simple and all the explanations are restricted by limits understandable to Everyman. By Freud for example. Yes, young Hannibal witnessed the death of his parents, he saw his sister brutally murdered and eaten by a bunch of subhumans. Certainly now we know why he's such an evil and why he eats people! Oh, the filmmakers forgot to discover if he peed in his bed as a boy and whether he was breastfed untill he was two years old. I mean, c'mon... Some things are better kept secret, really.

We were always amazed by Dr. Lecter's education and sophistication. Now we get to know in his teens he was raised by his aunt who was Japanese and tought him everything exquisite and elegant she knew from her homeland including bushido... Oh, and her family died in 1945 in Hiroshima(!) Come on now, people!

I truly believe Thomas Harris shouldn't have written this book. But since he's a talented writer and since Dino De Laurentiis is a talented producer and a person who knows how to squeeze everything possible from a story, Hannibal Rising came out to be rather good and professional. It will come to no one's mind to compare it to The Silence..., and people may argue about whether it's better or worse than Manhunter, Hannibal or Red Dragon, but anyway it's better to embrace this film as a separate work of art. This way you won't be disappointed. Not so known Gaspard Ulliel played young Hannibal which is a good thing because wide audience doesn't know him and he can be scarier and more ominous than any other famous actor. For that matter I also liked the rest of the cast. Not that famous but brilliant Rhys Ifans and beautiful Li Gong, popular in China but known in the West mainly by Mamoirs of Geisha and Miami Vice are extremely interesting to watch.",1172448000,2,3118,4.624548736462094

It shows that initially his blood lust was out of revenge, and how it evolved to much more.  My only question is how did he become Dr. Lecter, because it seams he left medical school in this movie to go to Canada to get the ""last man""  that murdered his sister.  Overall though, i did enjoy the movie dispite some flaws. There are some good Hannibal lines in the movie to quote, and the plot was something different. I guess I was hoping to see a movie that was set just before he was captured and put in jail, and the crimes he commited to get their. This movie starts our in his past way before that.

Gaspard Ulliel, with a phony dead look in his eye and his hair hanging in his face, looks like he could have been plucked from any high school drama club.

1599804,4,B00005JPKW,"It is a rare event indeed when a film adaptation surpasses the novel in just about all aspects.

Although Thomas Harris penned the screenplay, when the last credits began to roll, my thought was that the book was merely an incidental, written with the ultimate goal in mind to put the story on the screen. This is a very well produced film, well paced with spectacular detail, and an outstanding performance by unknown, Gaspard Ulliel, capturing that sophisticated, pure evil which we have come to expect from the good doctor: a truly mesmerising performance as the character grows to understand his true nature.

To be fair, the book was a sad disappointment, (see my review) making Hannibal into a card- board -cut- out- run-of-the-mill serial killer. It took a lot for me to spend the money to see the film, expecting the adaptation to fall short of the novel, thus when considering the blandness of the text, one would assume the film to be a disaster, not so in the least.

Gong Li as Lady Murasaki Shikibu is not only stunning but her gentle expressions reveal a sensitive soul and one that truly cared for Hannibal, staging a cover-up for his first murder. Interestingly, it is here we discover Hannibal's prime motivation to kill: terribly rude people, and that poor French butcher, (a Nazi collaborator) after being extremely rude to Lady Shikibu, copped it from Hannibal in a cruel, slow and creative fashion. This was an extremely tense scene in the film, where we first witness Hannibal's creative and great love for the kill.

In the film and the novel, including a mention in the last novel, `Hannibal', the reason the good doctor developed his tendency towards the eating of human flesh, still doesn't wash with me. The character is too complex, too intelligent, too self aware to suddenly carve out the delectable cheeks of his second victim and have a one-man barbecue. Harris should have researched a little harder and find what turns highly intelligent people into meat eaters of the human variety.

Although the professional critics panned this film, compared with the novel, Hannibal Rising is a good story and a good and fitting contribution to Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs films... a wonderful surprise...a solid four star rating.",1171756800,10,2258,4.900523560209424

The fault is the source material and the screenplay, and both of those fall fully onto the plate of Thomas Harris. The dialogue is preposterous. It is even more poorly written than the abominable THE HISTORIAN, the book from 2 summers ago that flexed the author's education and lack of ability to tell a story. This is worse. Gong Li, who is sumptyously beautiful and commanding in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER, is in a film even Christopher Lee would find embarrassing. God willing, this will disappear even from the video shelves and no one will recall what a career mis-step this is. She plays young Hannibal's aunt and has a bit of kinky rumpy-pumpy with the young gourmand. It is unsavoury from more perspectives than I can enumerate. Could be worse, though, she could be in a Bruce Willis or Jackie Chan movie.

There's no point in recounting the silly story, but when you hear young Hannibal deliver some of the lines, you honestly begin to pray that Anthony Hopkins will emerge from behind the curtains and slice open this chap's cranium.

1599866,3,B00005JPKW,"The fifth and possibly the last of the Lecter films tells the story of a young Hannibal Lecter and shows us why he became what he was.

Raised in the time of World War II,we see young Hannibal and his beloved sister Mischa (who's never mentioned in the previous films but in the novels) and their parents fleeing they're home to escape the horror of the Eastern Front with little success. They're parents are killed,leaving them to fend for themselves,which doesn't last long after a few predators of the human kind arrive. And the unthinkable and unimaginable happens and 8 year Hannibal witnesses it all.

Fast forward years later,we meet a teenage Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) living in a orphanage which happens to be his old home. He escapes their cruelness and flees to France to find refuge with his uncle's widow a mysterious and beautiful Japanese women (Gong Li), who helps Hannibal to heal from the horrors he survived. But he can't heal until he finds the war criminals who hurt him and his sister. He finds them and basically does to them what they did him and Mischa.

Why feel the need to explain Hannibal - isn't he 10,000 times more fun when he's an inexplicable sociopath?  People may think my review is unfair because I'm comparing the movie to those previously made, but one cannot judge this as a stand-alone movie!  If pre-quels or sequels do not have anything to add or don't come close to the expectations previously set, why even make them??

The movie starts out with the Lecter family living a bucolic life in their huge Luthuanian castle during WWII.  The family gets caught in the middle of a battle, and everyone is killed except Hannibal and his little sister, Mischa, who are taken captive by stranded soldiers.  The following events explain why Hannibal develops a predilection for consuming human flesh.  He spends the rest of the movie galavanting around Europe to track down the men who killed his sister, and murdering them.

A very serious storyline, but parts of the movie were so ridiculous, they were laugh-out-loud funny.  Hannibal's attraction to his random Japanese aunt, his ability to easily travel throughout post-war Europe when the police know he is a murderer, the speed in which he tracks down the soldiers who killed his sister, the mask from the samurai warrior ""foreshadowing"" the mask from Silence of the Lambs, and many other visual images that are just bizarre...

The sad part about the whole movie is that it completely destroys the mystique that Harris has built around Lecter.  In previous books/movies, Hannibal is refined, thoughtful, witty and a true gentleman (albeit in a backwards manner).  This Hannibal is a savage animal solely driven by vengeance.  The Silence of the Lambs Hannibal wouldn't waste his brain cells thinking about his counterpart in Hannibal Rising because he is so base and un-interesting.  Plus, this storyline gives the viewer a reason to feel bad for Hannibal and gives him an excuse for his behavior.  That's no fun!!

Plus, I don't think you could have picked a worse person to play Hannibal.  Anthony Hopkins set the bar high, and Ulliel can't pull off the contemplative, witty delivery required of post-Hopkins Hannibals.  Every time Ulliel starts the 10-second process it takes him to complete his signature ""sinister grin with head tilt"", I couldn't help but laugh because he's a cross between the Grinch Who Stole Christmas and the mask from Scream - it's ridiculous.

Well, there is plenty of sleaze to be sure, but the picture is so professionally done that it's hard to ignore Hannibal Rising as decent entertainment.

Set against the backdrop of World War II, the beginning of Hannibal Rising details the traumatizing childhood of Hannibal and his unfortunate sister.  From then on, Hannibal slowly becomes more and more deadly as he desires cannibalistic revenge against the ones who ate his sister.

This film lacks suspense and shows too many flashbacks and changes of place that at times disjoint the film.  But it's fun watching Gaspard Ulliel try his best to be Hannibal.  He's evil, but the ones he's hunting here are even more evil than he and for once it's a lot of fun to side with the ""bad guy"" in a movie.  Too many things seem underdeveloped (I'm interested in reading Thomas Harris's novel), but the film is beautifully shot, has great music, and features a few cool kill scenes.  The acting is pretty good too.  Rhys Ifans, a guy I never saw making a decent villain, portrays a guy who's one of the most deadly and vicious on-screen villains I've seen of late and he deserves a lot of credit.  Gong Li looks gorgeous here, but she has to recite cheesy lines and isn't given much to do.  And Ulliel plays Lecter over the top, but then again, so did Hopkins and he's great when he's going insane.

It's hard to call Hannibal Rising a great movie, but it is pretty cool.  I'd recommend seeing it in theaters at a discounted price, especially for horror fans looking for a decent gore film.",1171238400,9,1664,4.562289562289562
1599869,3,B00005JPKW,"It is best not to watch this film comparing this Hannibal to Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal. Expect a very bad movie and you may just enjoy it.

Very young Hannibal Lecter watches his parents die during World War II. He and his baby sister, whom he fiercely protects, hide out in his wealthy family's lodge until a group of SS looters spot their lights. These men terrorize Hannibal and his little sister until they realize that they could all starve in this desolate winter. Then they eat her.

Years later, Hannibal (now Gaspard Ulliel) attends a harsh boarding school set up on his old estate. It is evident that he is no longer a scared and distressed little boy. When a bully makes a move to strike him, Hannibal silently, swiftly, and expressionlessly stabs a fork through his aggressor's hand.

Hannibal escapes the school to his uncle's gorgeous widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). His aunt's wardrobe and manor are as beautiful as she. Basically, there a strange romance evolves between the two of them, despite his obsession with cannibalistic images and obvious delight in blood. Somehow Lady Murasaki doesn't seem to mind this, though she doesn't approve. (Are we supposed to believe it's because she is also scarred by losing her family in Hiroshima? Um. Okay.)

Hannibal realizes that he must quiet the echoing screams of his dead sister by eating those who ate his sister. Again, okay. While working at medical school, our ""hero"" tracks these killers down and brutally disposes of them.

Hannibal's position in the film is a funny one. He is almost heroic, in that he delivers just desserts to deserving specimen's of depravity. He even saves the damsel in distress and tells her that he loves her. On the other hand, he takes such obvious delight in sadistic murder and cannibalism, we are hardly meant to identify with him.

It is difficult to believe that a single event, however traumatic, would turn someone into a psychopathic serial killer. Hannibal screams at night, but he is otherwise cold and merciless. He shows no hesitation whatsoever at his first bloody kill. Ulliel has a distinct but attractive face, and in spite of the horrible dialogue, manages to come across as rather creepy and beyond disturbed.

Indeed, scattered throughout the long periods of silence is laughable dialogue. There are many unnecessary lines and moments in homage to later films. 'Hannibal Rising's conclusion is one of the worst I've seen because I didn't see it coming. I didn't realize that the climax was the climax.

Acting is difficult to gauge, as the script is so limiting. However, the music and cinematography are gorgeous.

I mildly enjoyed watching a budding serial killer wreak vengeance on awful people. If you love all things Hannibal, go for it. This is even for those who don't mind an almost intriguing drama with a bit of gore. Note that it is not exactly adrenaline pumping, though - it is rather slow and seems ultimately pointless. I doubt that 'Hannibal Rising' is for Hannibal purists. This Hannibal is quite different from the Hannibal we know. I simply accepted that Hannibal was much younger and therefore very unlike his later self. Whatever. It's a ridiculous but somewhat enjoyable film. Go see it if you want. Don't if you have any expectations.",1171152000,4,3273,4.893501805054152
1599870,3,B00005JPKW,"I haven't read the book, but from the looks of the customer reviews here at Amazon, not to mention those from the mainstream media, I'm better off for it.  However, as a film, ""Hannibal Rising,"" while not ""Silence of the Lambs,"" is a pretty decent suspense film - as good as we could expect as a follow-up to the good, but nothing-special ""Red Dragon"" (great performances, but a better, less typical ending and jettisoning other standard-issue thriller plot devices and clichs would have helped a ton) and better than we have any right to expect after the ludicrous ""Hannibal"" (a movie more laughable every time I come across it).  The problem with piling on sequels and prequels to movies about serial killers is the risk of turning a once original, brilliant, and terrifying subject into just another boogeyman, ala Jason and Freddy.  What worked as essentially a key supporting performance in ""Manhunter"" and ""Lambs"" has now become a franchise monster and it is hard to separate the genius of Anthony Hopkins' brilliant psychopath from any number of diabolical serial killers (it is a testament to the characters greatness - and, of course, Hopkins awesome performance - that, in spite of this, whenever I watch ""Silence,"" the character is still as chillingly effective as he was the first time I saw it).

""Hannibal Rising"" doesn't exactly reverse the trend, nor does it rival anything in ""Lambs,"" but what could have been an embarrassing and obvious attempt simply to cash-in on, and wring every last drop out of, a famous character, is actually, if nothing else, a decent thriller that, if it were not part of such a revered series, would probably be considered pretty darn good on its own. As it is, the story of Hannibal's transformation from a boy in WWII-ravaged Germany, who sees his parents murdered and his sister eaten by mercenaries, to a diabolical killer, hell bent on gruesome revenge leave something to be desired.  Hannibal's transformation happens pretty much the way I expected after hearing about the plot, and after that the movie is pretty much just a string of murders.  The only real thrill lies in seeing what diabolically brilliant idea young Hannibal has cooked up as a means for each individuals end.  These ideas become more far-fetched as they go along.

Still, ""Hannibal Rising"" looks great and Gaspard Ulliel, with his evil perma-smirk and crazy eyes channels Hopkins well without embarrassing himself the way another actor might have been unable to avoid doing.  What Hopkins did with this character was no small feat. He walked a fine line between portraying an evil genius and falling into camp hamminess.  Ulliel is no Hopkins, but then again, this character is no Hannibal - yet.  There is none of the long-winded monologues about fava beans and quid pro quo.  In, fact this Hannibal barely speaks.  Still, Ulliel, for the most part, seems to understand how to walk the same fine line Hopkins did and, thankfully, as a result, this film, while never truly terrifying, does not lapse into comedy, slasher-shtick, or even something that seems like a cheap cash-in ala ""Hannibal.""

""Hannibal Rising"" could have been shorter and without sounding morbid, I almost wish young Hannibal suffered a little more before turning into the monster we know.  Not that what happened to him and what he witnessed isn't enough to make anyone understandably crazy, but the film feels a bit like it's holding back and therefore it's less effective in allowing the audience to truly get into Hannibal's twisted head.  Many, many people suffered horrible fates during WWII.  They didn't all turn into Hannibal.  And, in all fairness, the people he takes revenge upon had nothing to do with his parents' death.  Hannibal is mainly on a quest to avenge his sister, but we all know from ""Lambs,"" etc that Hannibal continued to evolve into a serial killer long after he took revenge upon his sister's killers.  So what gives?  I guess we are supposed to just assume he developed a taste (no pun intended) for murder and cannibalism, but this film tries to justify his madness as a quest for revenge.  Fine, but then we are not really learning about Hannibal the brilliant doctor/serial killer.  We are seeing a movie that is the same as ""Death Wish,"" ""The Punisher,"" ""Kill Bill"" and any number of revenge sagas.  I was hoping for a film that showed the Lechter discussed so much in the previous films.  I guess that story would be the second chapter in this legacy.  Maybe there is room for at least one more film in this series after all, eh?

Not that I'd advise it.

Hannibal is already dangerously close to Freddy and Jason territory.  A shame considering he started out as the very antithesis of that brand of psycho killer.  But at this rate, another sequel and we might find him wearing a hokey mask and running around with a chainsaw.  Still, in a world of endless junk like the umpteenth remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and standard issue teen horror flicks like ""The Grudge"" that somehow pass for scary movies these days, I'll take a thriller like ""Hannibal Rising"" any day.

At least it is ambitious, even if never quite rivals the early Hannibal films.  And that's more than you can say for most films of this type.",1171152000,18,5249,4.822544642857143
1599871,3,B00005JPKW,"I often wondered about Hannibal's past after some of the previous movies hinted at it. So I was kind of hyped to see ""Rising"" and dashed out to see one of the first shows. I guess I hyped myself up alittle too much. What I was expecting to see was a tale of Hannibal developing his psychosis and later having it overcome and posses him. What I got instead was a revenge story that has been done to death in many a previous movie. It seemed almost cookie-cutter in it's delievery. The story starts off with a young Hannibal who flees his affluent house in Lithuania from the advancing Nazi army. Hannibals parents are killed leaving Hannibal to take care of his little sister. The two are held up in a little house in the forest in the dead of winter. The house is discovered by some nasty Nazis and soon the food runs out. This is where Hannibal is introduced to cannibalism and the tragic loss of his sister. The rest of the movie is very predictable. Hannibal grows up, is haunted by nightmares, finds out who the nazis are and exacts revenge. That's the movie. The silliest part is when Hannibal meets his uncle's wife and finds that she has a Samurai shrine in her basement. The rest of the movie Hannibal walks around sporting a Katana like a ronin wana be. What bothered me most is that they made Hannibal out as an anti-hero. He was a wronged victim running about wielding a Samurai sword killing big bad Nazis like a super hero. The film wanted you to like him. The image of Hannibal as a frightening Phychopathic killer never made an apprearance and was some what distroyed in the film. If you're a fan of Hannibal movies then you should check it out but it also wouldn't hurt you to sit this one out.",1171065600,2,1710,4.380503144654088
