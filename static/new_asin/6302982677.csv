So what if this 1973 release does not have the original russian in it, I am just glad THIS version even exist! I do recommend you read the original story that this cartoon is based on-much more entertaining on a warm summer night.",1241222400,,299,4.555555555555555
527077,5,6302982677,"This was one of my favorites growing up, and my daughter loves it too. My brother found another version a few years ago and it was terrible (""The Magic Horse""). It was one they redubbed more recently and changed everything - the kid's name was Timothy, no songs, the magic pony didn't have a name, and the dialog was very poor/boring. I was very happy to find this version again! I did not notice any deleted scenes. All the songs were there, scenes were there, started from beginning to end. Not sure what the other poster meant. But maybe I grew up on a cut version too so I never noticed.",1235174400,,591,4.333333333333333
527078,3,6302982677,"This was not the original version. It was a nice movie and the copy was decent but it was missing too many scenes. It was like when you go to the movies to see a movie and then on dvd it has some scenes cut, and again if you wait a few more years on tv it has more scenes cut and yet then again a few more years on the newest dvd if you didn't buy it the first time around, you would notice even more scenes were missing. This was that version. Too many scenes were missing. I was greatly dissapointed by the missing content as it was a childhood movie my family enjoyed for years and thought we had recovered.",1220832000,6,610,3.967479674796748
527079,4,6302982677,"Well ever since i lost this movie I have been looking for it and just recently I started up my search again and was successful. The reason why i spent all this time trying to find it, is because, as a child I was completely mesmerized by this movie and is definitely worth buying if you like a tale told similiarly to the Arabian Nights books. However it does have pretty retro moments but they are easily overlooked if you are involved in the movie. X_X",1206403200,,454,4.290697674418604

7832970,5,6302982677,"Movies 2 Night provided the merchandise as promised, even the sleeve protector was in good shape. I am happy to have my movie again just as I remember. The Russian folk story is brought to live by the vivid animation that reflects the Russian culture. A must see for all artists.",1369008000,,279,4.490196078431373
7832971,3,6302982677,"This video had very poor audio and visual quality at the beginning. The quality improved somewhat as the movie went on, but it was never great.",1356652800,,143,4.538461538461538
7832972,5,6302982677,"this vhs is very old, so the quality isn't the greatest. this was the first movie i saw on our
vhs and it is a fun story that i remember fondly thirty years later.",1346198400,,163,3.823529411764706
7832973,5,6302982677,"I needed this for a friends birthday and couldn't find it anywhere but here! It shipped fast and played very well for being an old tape, the box has a few nicks but i was told that and its not bad. I cant wait to give it to my friend!",1341273600,,234,3.7
7832974,3,6302982677,"I really love this movie. When I was a little girl I used to watch it, now that I have kids of my own I want them to share those same memories as I do. I rated this item as ok because it is a VHS there is alot of background noise that you don't get with a DVD, so in this case I would love to rate it better because they were very prompt in getting it to me and I am grateful for that. Thank you!! Hopefully one of these days I can get ti on DVD!!!
Thanks Again!!!!

7832975,2,6302982677,"The product seller, DANDYLIONBOOKS, claimed this product was in VERY GOOD condition, but in fact it was closer to BELOW AVERAGE CONDITION. The box was torn and jury-rigged with scotch tape and the video was scratched leaving about 5 minutes of the movie lost to something that looks like white noise. The price was very low so I can see why it was in this condition, but falsely claiming it was in very good condition when it was clearly in poor condition is BLATANT FALSE ADVERTISING.",1305763200,,485,4.651162790697675
7832976,5,6302982677,Traditional tale with some very exciting animation.  The film was dubbed in English from the Russian original.  This version is better than the more modern one that has more hollywood formula stars in it.  I particularly like the king's voice which you may recognise as Thurston Howell from Gulligans Island or Mr. Magoo from saturday morning cartoons.  Jim Bacus gives a great preformance as the bumbling king in this classic Russian folk tale.,1274400000,,445,5.054794520547945
