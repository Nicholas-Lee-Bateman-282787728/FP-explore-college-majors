7947570,4,B00005NOO9,"Kagami, Aya's nefarious uncle, begins to bring out his real plans in this 3rd volume of Ceres. Aya and Suzumi are not the only ones that have continued the bloodline of the original celestial maiden. There are many others spread around Japan and Kagami has begun to meddle with their DNA by adding a ""C-Genome"" which while heightening the test subject's power, also shortens their life. One such test subject is a classmate of Aya's who is having an affair with the school doctor. When the doctor thinks Aya is going to tell on them, he sends the girl to kill her, not knowing that she now has the power to control flames! Another complicating factor in all this is that Toya has also joined the school medical staff to keep near Aya! We do get a little more background on Yuhi in these episodes and find out why he was cast out of his own family and about Suzumi's widowed marriage.

Ceres continues along with its if not plodding, then cautious approach to storytelling as you feel you're still in the setup stage of this anime. I have enjoyed the complex manueverings of all the different characters, and as with all shojo love triangles, you're left in suspense as to who the heroine would pick at this stage. It seems Aya is in love with Toya, but seems to also see Yuhi as a more rational choice, but since when is a heart rational? Hopefully, we won't see wave after wave of C-Genome mutants coming after Aya with different superpowers the rest of the series. The male characters still seem to be taking themselves too seriously, speaking in mostly hushed undertones and precisely pronounced  words, at least on the bad guy side of the equation. Yuhi is a bit more animated, and has more of a range of acting. A good show so far.",1159660800,,1736,4.507936507936508
7947571,3,B00005NOO9,"Basically, the Makage family started capturing those with the C-Genome Genes in order to complete their project of creating a new world.  Suzumi was on their list, but she was rescued by Aya slash Ceres.  Meanwhile, Aya kinda realized her love for Tooya and his love for her as well.
I've always love Yuu Watasu's Anime and Manga, like Fushigi Yugi..but Ceres, I thought i was good at first, coz the art looked really pretty and the story line seemed good.  But then when I rent it, and really started watching it..it was not as nearly touching and what's the word..""stiring"" as Watasu's other animes.  It's like suddenly Tooya and Aya became lovers? It's all too quick.  and if you're buying it, DO NOT BUY THE VHS DUBBED, no offense, the english voice acters are terrible, especially Aya's, she sounds like some 7 year old kid.  It's worth rent and everything, but definitely not worth buying...",1047168000,,897,4.717948717948718

7947573,5,B00005NOO9,"The 3rd volume of 'Ceres' is very moving as we learn more about Suzumi. This tape is dramatic, but entertaining. It's recommended as much as the two before it.",1013385600,,159,4.517241379310345
7947574,4,B00005NOO9,"This DVD delves more into the plot line surrounding the whole Ceres issue. It explains more about why the Mikage family is after Ceres and what they want, but it doesn't give away TOO much information. Episode 7 actually introduces a new angel by the name of Yuki. And Yuuhi says something he shouldn't *giggle*
It clears up a lot of the ""huh?"" questions floating through my head after the first 6 episodes, but there is still much to be discovered. All in all this was a wonderful 3 episodes and money well spent.",1003449600,3,514,4.4787234042553195
