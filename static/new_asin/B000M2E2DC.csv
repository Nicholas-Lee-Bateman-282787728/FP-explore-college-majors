8165709,5,B000M2E2DC,"This is a very cute anime, kinda over priced though.  I bought the first one for really cheap.  Each dvd after was more and more expensive and there for I have yet to finish the series.  You better like cutesy if you are gonna buy this.",1362182400,,236,4.086956521739131
8165710,5,B000M2E2DC,"I use the Full Moon Series as a cultural component of my middle school Japanese curriculum.  The kids are drawn to the animae and love the series, which is most effectively used by having them watch and listen in Japanese with English subtitles.",1361318400,,245,4.6976744186046515
8165711,4,B000M2E2DC,"Mitsuki is a step closer to achieving her dream, but nothing worthwhile comes easy. Full Moon has a concert at an orphanage. She meets a coupe of children that remind her of herself and Eichi. She helps them find happiness together. After that, she gets a substitute manager while Ms. Oshige has the flu. Her new manager is eager, but causes some problems. Her gets discouraged, but Mitsuki tells him that she had lots of fun with him. That gives him the motivation to go on. Mitsuki also has a couple encounters with people out to sabotage her career. Fortunately, she is able to come through unscathed.

This anime is really cute. The characters are fun, and the story is lively and uplifting. This isn't quite as good as the other volumes, but it's still pretty enjoyable. I think this series is geared toward younger girls, but it's got some great lessons to teach, and gives us hope for the future and the courage to achieve our dreams. I think that there's something here for every anime fan to enjoy.",1360627200,,1007,4.594444444444444
8165712,5,B000M2E2DC,the layout of the story is really good i really like the show and give it a full blown 5 starts. it is a really nice story. and i love the graphics as well. as soon as  i saw the first episode i new i had to get the entire show even though it wasmn;t completely finished so if you want to see the last episodes you have to order it from japan and resd the subs. but other than that it is a superb show.,1260057600,,402,3.6744186046511627
8165713,5,B000M2E2DC,"I love this lush series. Its very cute and not to graphic , something that your kids can watch . It also has a very original storyline and well planed out charactors. ""One of the best anime's I've ever layed eyes on"". Says Miyazaki(award winner for his famous ghibli films such as Princess Monoke, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Kiki's delivery service).
Overall I give it a 5.",1212537600,,386,4.608695652173913
8165714,4,B000M2E2DC,"Okay first of all I LOVE THE COVER! (Mitsuki + Takuto <333) I love this DVD cause it has my FAVIORITE episode.

Episode 13: That Taki boy is evil at first but he really has a good reason. THe end made me cry its soooo sad.

Episode 14: THis is a filler episode. But its fun to watch. :)

Episode 15: WOOOOOOOT THIS IS MY FAVORITE EPISODE! :D!!! YAAAA!It's SOOO CUTE how Takutop is jealous of that stupid PLAYER guy. ugh I hate guys like Murakami!!! That @$$*$&&%*!!! I wish Mitsuki and Takuto had actually...gotten even cloiser..than what they did...;)... It';s so cute how the wind...randomly blew right there.hehehehehehe..

Episode 16: ugh *sighs* THat Bi%^# Madoka. SHe'/s SOO much nicer in the manga.

So basiclly: BUY IT!! Whatever you do you MUST WATCH EPISODE 15 :D

Oh yeah the Dub is Ok but could be a trillino times better.",1202515200,,834,4.563758389261745
8165715,5,B000M2E2DC,"The English dub is much better than the Japanese. It's easier to enjoy the show without having to read all those subtitles. For Mitsuki's singing, they just put in the same singer and lyrics as in the Japanese version, but it really would ruin the series if a different singer was chosen...Myco is an incredible vocalist.",1178150400,,321,4.75
