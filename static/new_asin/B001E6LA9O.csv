The exercises work mostly on the legs with the aid of arms to support the medicine ball. Very good variation of exercises to balance the strength of the whole body in addition to upper body exercises to complete the body conditioning. Thanks for showing us this presentation and it is for anyone who needs strong legs. Good recommendation.",1415232000,,434,4.958904109589041
8296717,5,B001E6LA9O,"I started using this DVD a week ago.  I have already noticed an improvement in my lower body and core strength.  Mr. Franco has designed a challenging medicine ball workout.  The directions for each exercise are clear and easy to follow.  The DVD includes exercises for individuals and workout partners.  My personal favorite is the steamroller, a move that conditions abdominals to withstand body shots.  I recommend this DVD to anyone serious about improving core and lower body strength.",1245283200,,490,5.139240506329114
8296718,5,B001E6LA9O,"In this DVD, Mr. Franco brings premier athletic training into the world of self defense. Medicine Ball workouts have long been a favorite of many athletic trainers but have been unheard of in the RBSD world. Mr. Franco utilizes his innovative approach to self defense and teaches us how to use this tool to develop the functional strength and explosive power that we need to fight for our life. Excellent Product!!",1219622400,,414,4.845070422535211
8296719,5,B001E6LA9O,"Once again Mr. Franco delivers a great product. Each exercise is demonstrated and explained in a clear manner. Anyone serious about improving their level of fitness or just providing some variety in their workouts should consider this dvd.
Mr. Franco also  tells which exercises strengthen certain self defense techniques. I had no idea there were so many medicine  ball moves. I plan on incorporating what I learned in this dvd into my own training.
