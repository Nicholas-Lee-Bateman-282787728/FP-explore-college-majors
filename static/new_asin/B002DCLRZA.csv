8365053,5,B002DCLRZA,"I've still got new copies of the initial version, which describes and shows the subject matter in the same way as this 2-DVD set. I did not mind the ""bubbles"", but it does make reading the quotes of important banking industry figures difficult to read; they should not be shrouded in a small window while scrolling down.

However awkward it is in its presentation, it would still have to be referred to regularly, either in viewing or in memory recall. It is so condensed with information that it takes continual reflection and integration with real world issues, including the serious problem of education, and of money not being created for interest charges on money loans.

Everything on this DVD covers just about everything one needs to know about our European-based (incl. USA) money supply system. The more one reflects on its contents and integrates it with other economic issues of our time, the more shocking it becomes and the more outraged one can become.

I've been reflecting on the initially issued DVD for over 9 years, and I'm still picking out relevant details in it; the latest being how banks skew economies by lending mostly to those who exploit people or the environment for profit. This debt-based system is the root of most all other economic ills, including rising property and housing prices.

It helps show one that money and wealth is not the same thing, and that money has become an iniquitous commodity for trade (e.g. currency speculation), which is forbidden by sharia law, along with interest charges, in Islamic banking.

Wealth is goods & services, and money is a number-based token system for trading in goods & services. Our debt-based money supply is providing these tokens with less than 3% relevance to such wealth having been, or going to be produced. The DVD describes this iniquitous anomaly briefly.

The banksters have been given so much international State sanction on monopolistic money supply, for so long, that a myriad of other complex systems of financial inequity have permeated our economies.

These DVDs provide the basic details for understanding, along with a few examples to begin with. One has to extrapolate the basic knowledge to real-world issues for oneself, either from observation or experience.

This DVD is my prime (though not only) mental and physical reference for seeing the fallacies of political and economic arguments presented in newspapers and the TV. It p___s me off to no end when seeing how much waffle is spoken and acted on by industry leaders, academic economists, politicians, and the like  they're even getting paid disgusting quantities of money for doing it!

What is even more shocking is to realise that local and national governments are also borrowing this debt money, and were paying for it in cutbacks and privatisation  with little or no reduction in taxes for paying the incumbent officials and politicians. The banks are laughing all the way to the bank!",1522454400,,2948,4.995918367346939

8365055,5,B002DCLRZA,This movie is very informative.  The animations really illustrate how the debt and money system works.  Worth watching.,1404864000,,119,5.555555555555555
8365056,5,B002DCLRZA,"Learned more about money system in 45 minutes than in 40 years in public school and the workforce. Great video, hats off to the people who made this video.",1404432000,,155,4.379310344827586
8365057,5,B002DCLRZA,"There are some flaws in the first edition of Money as Debt, some of which are removed from the updated edition.  Some of the quotations it uses are unreliable, and some of the economic analysis is not quite thorough.  However, overall the analysis and exposition are good enough to have been used in economics classes, both high school and collegiate, across the globe.

This is basically a clarification of monetary theory, the basics of which are simple, but which are deviously clouded in opaque jargon.  When all of the gibberish is stripped down, you find revelations about the global monetary ""system"" that will make you look at the world with brand new eyes, and in clearer relief that you've ever seen it.

Essential viewing.",1313884800,4,733,4.879032258064516
8365058,5,B002DCLRZA,This is a must for people living in denial that our country and leaders have our best interest at heart with our economy and that of a decent living standard for us the poor or what some would consider middle class. It's an eye-opener and gets one to think and understand reality with money inflation and how money gets printed out of thin air by the banksters and the Federal Reserve which it has nothing to do with the government and that of the people and for the people.,1301011200,7,474,4.337078651685394
