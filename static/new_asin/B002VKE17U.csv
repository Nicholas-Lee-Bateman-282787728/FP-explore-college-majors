A virus has decimated humanity so a foursome with an unknown history are traveling cross country to hopefully find a safe haven. Along the way we get peppered with the usual long string of irritating moments and self defeating actions amongst this isolated crew. There are no zombies or nasty critters anywhere, just an infrequent mixing of other survivors out to save themselves. Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci play the brothers that lead this group, and they both give decent performances. The pace is not meant to be scary, and there is no horror (as the cover art would make you think - it shows the only real ""jumper"" moment with a dying person zombie look-alike).

The 84 minutes seems short, but for what they made the film about in ambiguity and lack of closure or big picture items, it fits. Go in not expecting anything huge, just a slow burn post virus kind of film that throws the moral compass decisions right at you. Not a bad film or an original idea, just nothing takes this DVD to the next level of being really good. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is a solid 5.1 with subs in English, French and Spanish - Spanish language track is included.

As if the premise of apocalyptic plague wasn't depressing enough, this flick drags you through 94 minutes of frustrating character conflicts, misplaced compassion leading to cruel ends, and people giving up hope.

It's a very-well-produced indie film, undoubtedly, and the acting is quite good across the entire cast, although Chris Pine turns in another familiar portrayal of...well...Chris Pine.

The plot is straightforward: Two brothers and their girlfriends try to navigate through a dreary, plague-ravaged American landscape encountering and dealing with (or not dealing with) other paranoid survivors along the way.  That's about it.  There's no cure for the contagious hemmorrhagic disease, just occasional vague rumors of treatments that give some survivors a little fleeting hope.

The most frustrating thing about the film are the liberal, urban-bred characters who throw caution to the wind and, consequently, expose themselves and everyone else to deadly disease and other dangers.  A solid half of the plot would be unnecessary except for dimwitted characters who can't follow the simplest precautions.  It's infuriating.

Technically, it's a good film, no question about that.  But do you feel entertained or satisfied or uplifted for watching it?  No.  It's a perpetually sad story from beginning to end that only succeeds in producing a sense of hopelessness.",1524355200,9,1439,5.580645161290323
3996542,2,B002VKE17U,"You'd think actors like Chris Pine and Piper Perabo would have a great many scripts to choose from. It's astonishing, therefore, that they both decided to participate in this very ho-hum by-the-numbers post-apocalypse clich. The problem with movies like this is that in order to manufacture the necessary ""suspense"" the lead characters have to be utterly clueless. They have to do stupid things over and over again in order to generate those supposed ""oh no!"" moments. But the flaw, of course, is that utterly clueless people don't survive difficult situations. They die because they do stupid things. So the movie perpetually lurches along well past the point of tedium precisely because there is zero interest in watching stupid characters doing stupid things and yet magically getting away with it because they are, of course, the lead characters and without them the movie would end abruptly. But that, from an audience's perspective, would be highly desirable. Why waste valuable minutes of one's life sitting staring at moving tedium?",1524355200,2,1040,5.233532934131737

3996581,3,B002VKE17U,"""Carriers"" is reasonably good.

If you're looking for a terrifying zombie movie, you should probably pass. This one works best on the level of a character study which reveals, not character depths, but more its absence.

The script isn't great and the plot's a bit predictable. And I can't say I really cared about any of the characters, except for the father of a little infected girl.  The other characters had little to evoke sympathy.

Chris Pine pretty much carries the movie. He's got style, sex appeal, all those good things.  I suspect the reason the studio hasn't promoted this movie is that since its making, Pine has been off doing better and better projects; this one is reasonably good but won't do much to increase his star power, which has shot way above the level of this not-very-high-budget film.

The ""moral,"" if there is one, seems to be that in situations like those shown in the movie, people really should really do what makes sense for their own survival. The infected can't be saved, so there's nothing compassionate about pretending that they can. In this light, Pine's character's harshness comes across as the most reasonable choice..",1522972800,,1162,4.873096446700508

3996623,4,B002VKE17U,"This movie is similar to other virus infested movies that turn people into zombies, but instead, in this movie the virus causes people to die, but during their period of infection, they can transfer the infection to other healthy bodies.  There is no cure, so people either die off on their own or are killed by others who fear the infection.  This causes towns and cities to go empty with corpses, so the few who survive simply drive with what gas they have left to locate shelter where they can.  Chris Pines' character is acted out in a way that just makes you hate him.  You have to remind yourself that it's not that he's doing poorly in his acting, but that his character is so annoying because he does stupid things that makes you hate him.

The concept of the movie is very good though.  It made me imagine that if people aren't willing to avoid others when they catch the flu, what makes us think the people will avoid others if they have this deadly infection (found in this movie).  There are interesting moments in the movie when characters must make important decisions when it comes to loved ones who are infected.  What would you do if you were infected?  Would you let your loved ones know, which means you would get ousted?  Or what if you find out that a loved one is infected with this deadly virus that can easily spread, would you kill or leave the person behind?

I'm an old guy and it takes a bit to grip my emotions, but this finale was so sad and tragic it brought tears to my eyes. All of the characters were set on surviving, but the one girl friend of the Chris Pine character foolishly ignored his warnings about staying in the car with the infected little girl, and she wound up getting infected herself. Then she exposed him and the others to infection, too. The plot has been well described by earlier reviewers, so I see no point in going there now. Who could not be moved by the final scenes, where the one brother remembered the brother he left behind? I guess all of those one-star ""reviewers,"" if you could call them that, were expecting just another zombie movie, and when it didn't deliver them, well...

I would say this. If you are afraid to confront the matter of death, your own as well as that of others, then this movie's not for you.

3996677,5,B002VKE17U,"A very different type of ""zombie"" movie, in the age of zombie movies.  You rarely actually see the infected (presented as some sort of virus/rash that slowly takes over your sanity and makes you incredibly ill).  There are no scores of undead - it actually seems people aren't reanimated upon death.  This is simply as story about survival in a world where that has become a difficulty.

It's hard to describe the movie in detail without giving too much away. Just like Zombieland (actually released after the film was created, but Paramount chose not to give Carriers a release until after), there are rules to survival in this world.  Avoid the infected at all costs (even their breath can be incredibly contagious). Disinfect, disinfect, disinfect.  The sick are already dead.  You may survive if you stick to these rules, but as the characters discover throughout their journey, sticking to them is a completely different story.

Their goal is Turtle Beach - where the two brothers Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Brian (Chris Pine) went as children, and they are joined by their friends/girlfriends Bobby (Piper Perabo) and Kate (Emily VanCamp). Turtle Beach may be one of the last places the virus hasn't reached, and somewhere they four hope to find a resthaven. Along the way they encounter situations that put their ""rules"" to the test (Stranded old ladies, just wanting to bum a ride to safety, a father and his little girl who is already sick, hoping to be taken to the only place where a ""cure"" might be available ... and what happens when one of their own is infected.)  It's a thought provoking movie, and one of the more realistic scenarios of any in this particular genre.

I urge anyone who is a fan of these type of movies to give it a shot.  It's a very underrated film and one I believe would have been more popular had it been given a national release.  For now, it simply rides on the coattails of the zombie genre and Chris Pine's sudden rise to fame.",1470787200,3,1971,4.664739884393064

3996690,3,B002VKE17U,"Carriers was not a terrible movie, but I cant say it was really a good movie at all, either.  The general post-apocalyptic schema this movie is built around starts out interestingly enough  a world infected with a deadly plague with no cure; teens and young twenty-somethings riding around from town to town trying to find supplies, water, etc. in engaging enough, as well.
The problem with the movie is seems to use a lot of the same pieces many other apocalyptic movies have  the mix is simply kind of boring.  You have the good kid who wants to help, the self-absorbed girls, one not a bad or good girl, the other a kind of semi-bad girl who of course is dating/romantically involved with the Alpha male who wants to survive at all costs.  Enter the family who needs help, a man and little girl and of course the little girl is sick.  Then we meet the scientists who are all dying as well.  And  dunh dunh dunh  one of the members gets sick and then another and theres a power-play about what should be done.
In the end, its a good enough watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon, but if you're looking to actually pay for the movie front a rental standpoint, I would say wait until you can find it on a subscription channel  or better yet, wait until it comes on cable.  If you don't have cable, simply read the synopsis online and youll have about as much understanding as you really need.
If given the option for half stars, I would give it a 2.5.  But, because there isn't that option, I will be VERY generous and go ahead and give it three stars.",1468540800,6,1547,4.351916376306621

3996696,4,B002VKE17U,"Obviously if you look at the reviews here this is a movie that divides audiences. Still, 58% give it a four or five star rating, so those who do like it seem to like it quite a bit . I;m one of those. I think whether or not you like this film is largely dependent upon expectations and what  you look for in this genre. You would have to call this a post-apocalyptic film, but don't look for anything like The Road and its scenes of bleak destruction. The budget is not big here, so this film takes place during the end of an epidemic that has killed almost everyone, and killed them so fast that most everything looks pretty much like it usually does. There are no zombies in this apocalypse, so no massive traffic jams, either. The infected are purely human, just sick, dying people and they do not come running at top speed to eat you. There are no post apocalyptic camps with tricked out vehicles or people ready for a Sid Vicious concert. So if you're looking for any of those things you are going to be disappointed.

Although I can enjoy any of those other takes on the post apocalyptic scene, I tend to like best the ones that don't glamorize it or overload it with action, but which portray it pretty much as it would really be. That's what this film does. Brian (Chris Pine) and Danny(Lou Taylor-Pucci) are brothers; Brian is a jerk and knows it ; Danny, younger, was a student at Yale. They are uninfected and decide to go to Turtle Beach, where they spent many happy childhoods. It seems to be several states away (and the beach was shot on Texas' Gulf Coast). Brian brings his girlfriend Bobby (piper Perabo) and Danny his friend Kate (Emily Van Camp), both of whom are also uninfected. There are strict rules to follow if they are to remain safe.

The film builds on the normal tension and fears  that would occur on such a journey. Things do happen and they have consequences. The threats are real but they are normal sized and don't depend on outsized frights. After all a single angry dog or a pair of muggers would be a serious threat in real life. You don't always need supernatural creatures or hordes of cannibals. These people are really trying to survive in a world where an invisible virus is fatal. Some people find this all too slow paced, but it allows for tension to build up among the very credible actors. Some people don't like the characters, especially obnoxious Brian and find the others a bit air-headed or not survivalist enough to survive. But these are the kind of people who might accidentally survive; there's no requirement of heroism or bravery.

I find the movie unsettling and unrelenting in its way. If you can take this movie on its own terms, it's really good.",1459555200,31,2707,4.482758620689655

3996862,5,B002VKE17U,"'Carriers' has been rerun on cable long enough for most people to know the plot, and by now most people are familiar with Chris Pine, who made this little low budget gem before 'Star Trek' made him an overnight household name.

I give this 5 stars. Here's why:

A low budget film that doesn't feel low budget. It just doesn't need big sets and CG special effects to tell its story.

At first I wasn't impressed with the casting, but as the film progresses I realized they are very skillfully portraying characters that I'm not supposed to find very likeable or appealing. That's not easy. And yet, the characters grow on you. I found myself caring about their fates.

This accurately conveys the reality of a fatal pandemic with an incurable and highly contagious disease. Anyone infected is already dead, even though they're still walking (and threatening, or bargaining, or pleading). The only way to survive is to avoid infection. That includes instantly leaving the infected behind. Break your self-quarantine, and die. Fail to properly sterilize something, and you die. Compassion is not a survival asset.

There are scenes and moments in this film that slip past your defenses and stay with you long after the film is over. It's very re-watchable, with multiple layers to the script and the directing.

One complaint, which consistently bothers me with each viewing but which I understand from a plot standpoint. In 'Carriers' our carefree foursome is able to just tool down the wide open interstates of North America, gettin' their kicks on Route 66. Only late in the film is there a really believable encounter on the road, when the brothers murder a pair of women in cold blood for whatever gasoline they hope may be in their fuel tank.
Yet, we all know that in a real pandemic the first thing that would happen is the interstates would be blocked and impassable. Gigantic multi-car pileup wrecks clogging every intersection and off ramp. Man-made barricades and checkpoints set up by military and police and by self-appointed townspeople hoping to block contagion from their towns.
Not to mention the gangs and other predators who'll set up pirate roadblocks of their own. So there would really be no long distance motorized travel at all, and any travel on foot would be 'The Road' meets 'Book Of Eli'--both great films, by the way.

But then this would be a very different movie and the goal (reaching the escapist fantasy of a remembered childhood seaside getaway) would be obviously impossible. Still, my suspension of disbelief has to work overtime. Yet that's my only complaint.

NOTE: this review contains spoilers. They are not specific to the plot, but the revelations in the first paragraph may diminish your enjoyment of the film; you may want to watch the movie first. (You do want to watch the movie.)

Carriers is the most interesting example of a bait-and-switch movie I've ever seen. When I sat down to watch it, I was all set to start off with an opening paragraph excoriating the filmmakers for giving away one of the film's main spoilers in its very title, not to mention doing the same to the guy at Netflix who wrote the plot synopsis. After all, the filmsupposedlyturns on the idea that its four principal characters are trying to stay alive during a pandemic, then discover that they are actually patient zero (or, well, patient zero through three), and they're actually giving it to everyone they come into contact with. This is not the case, which makes me wonder why they chose that name in the first place. It also sets the viewer up to expect a certain kind of film. Carriers is not that film. It is, instead,  a dramaI hesitate to use the term moral drama, but if the shoe fitsabout various people and how they react to surviving in a post-apocalyptic landscape. It has far more in common with Tim Fehlbaum's moody German thriller Bright than it does with the current spate of zompocalypse movies.

Plot: two brothers and the girlfriendsDanny and Brian (Evil Dead's Lou Taylor Pucci and Star Trek's Chris Pine) and Kate and Bobby (Brothers and Sisters' Emily VanCamp and Coyote Ugly's Piper Perabo)are, as we open, speeding through the desert in a stolen Mercedes. Not that anyone notices the car is stolen; they are four of the last survivors in America. A pandemic (I have read online synopses that say it's a strain of bird flu, though I don't remember hearing that in the movie) has devastated the populace; as far as we can tell, the number of human beings left alive in America at the opening of the film can be counted in the dozens. (Towards the end of the movie, as some of the remaining survivors are driving through Texas, we hear a radio broadcast from a woman who reports that she is the last person left alive in Corpus Christi.) Brian has formulated a number of rules for survival that have kept them alive; he also half-believes, since neither he nor his brother have been infected, that the family is chosen, and that they and the ladies will be ultimately responsible for repopulating America. (The first part of that sentence is explicitly stated in the movie. The second part is not, but looking at it like that puts a whole lot of the first half of the movie into perspective.) As we open, they have been driving for an undetermined, but lengthy, amount of time without having encountered anyone else. That changes when they run across Frank (Law and Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni) and his daughter Jodie (Flowers in the Attic's Kiernan Shipka), who are on their way to a nearby town where, supposedly, a team of doctors have come up with a new serum that is helping. Teaming up with Frank and Jodie would break...most of them. Circumstances, however, force an alliance, and the foursome take a detour from their west coast destination to get Frank and Jodie to the medical complex.

It's tough to give a plot synopsis becauseand, like the opening paragraph, this could be construed by some people to be a major spoilerCarriers is an episodic film. Our protagonists move through the film, and other characters surround them, but the way the movie is structured emphasizes their aloneness on this roadtrip through a blasted desert landscape; all of their relationships are temporary, and ultimately, the central question posed by the movie is whether these characters are capable of forming permanent relationships, including with each other. That may seem an odd central question in a movie focused on two brothers, but as time goes on, the companionship between Danny and Brian frays. Given the context, there's a real air of menace about fights that would, in most other movies, seem kind of trivial. Here, they work.

The best shot in the movie comes about two-thirds of the way through. The band as it stands at that point are running low on gas, and they stop at a gas station. The sign at the roadside says MICHAEL DEAD/MEAT IN TOWN. Instead of an A, it's an upside-down V. The letters are in two colors. You've seen a hundred gas station signs with two-colored letters and misspelled words in real life. When's the last time you saw one in a movie? *** ",1401926400,,4566,4.707133917396746

Granted, this movie does not bring anything new to the genre, but it is executed very well.  Carriers is filled with a lot of ""what would I do?"" situations and cleverly explores different outcomes.  The movie is filmed entirely from the perspective of the main characters, so there are a lot of loose threads (what started the outbreak? what happened to that character? what just happened in the background?).

You've got the moderately douchey jock who's as serious as he he is carefree, his irresponsible but not unlikable girlfriend, his emotionally driven younger brother, & the gal pal who manipulates men into letting them think they're calling the shots by directing them & making them do all the work, yet is not particularly dislikable.

It's interesting to note that Christopher Meloni of ""Law & Order SVU"" is in a good chunk of this movie, because there is another Outbreak movie called ""Warning Sign"" staring Sam Waterson of the original ""Law & Order.

Like The Walking Dead, it's a survival movie that reflects on the cold selfish indifference & distrusting nature of mankind against eachother when the s**t hits the fan.

3996943,4,B002VKE17U,"This is a well-made low budget virus movie which looks and feels like a much larger budget film. Chris Pine (destined for great things in Star Trek) does a sound job in the lead role with an excellent supporting cast.

Suprisingly well filmed, the script & story are solid. We witness the journey of 4 survivors across the US heading towards an almost mythical beach location. Everywhere they find the dead & the desperate. The journey brings some hard decisions & one strength of the film is that the characters refuse to fall into the classic good or bad category. As things get desperate, the thin line disappears.....what's right & wrong anyway when the world is dying..

I can't understand some of the very negative reviews here. This is a solid post-apoc film. It's not going to win any prizes but it's a realistic & gritty portrayal of the 'end times'.

Expect few special effects apart from grisly corpses...this is more of a sci-fi/viral horror than a slasher or zombie flick.

It's right up my alley, viruses or zombies or post-apoclyptic nightmare, etc. But it's also really another genre I love, emotional dramas. I didn't know much about it when I bought it but I'm glad I wasn't expecting a zombie horor film, it's a more personal drama about the four main characters.

No plague set-up or explanation, we're dropped right into the middle of the aftermath in the beginning of the film. There's a lot of cliched behavior from other post-apoc movies. The reckless driving, the drinking and who gives a s*** attitude towards life, the gas rationing and (my least favorite part), the golf course montage.

Would I behave that way? I never can decide. I might be like a kid in a candy store, or paranoid hyper-vigilant beyond my wits. The characters seem to let their guard down too often, another cliche. The diving board scene for instance.

But the actors and the characters rise above the cliches, a great performance by Chris Meloni as well. I still had questions throughout about the disease and especially the spreadability of it, but oh well. Re: my title, it does work well as a small screen drama. It's more low-key than a Resident Evil, or The Crazies or 28 Days Later. As long as you're ready for that, and maybe like my sister you can't stand the ""Dawn of the Dead"" guts-eating(!) then this may be for you too.",1328918400,2,1462,4.637065637065637
3996949,5,B002VKE17U,"2009's ""Carriers"" is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic films. The story involves four youths in Southwest USA seeking sanctuary from a lethal virus that has wiped out much of the population and continues to do so. To all intents and purposes Government no longer exists and society is now a world without laws. To survive, they live by a set of rules of their own making: Avoid anyone with the disease, trust no one (not even your friends/family), immediately sterilize anything a carrier touches and realize that anyone with the disease is already dead.

The four youths are Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), his brother Brian (Chris Pine), his girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo) and Danny's school friend Kate (Emily VanCampo). Over the course of a handful of days they are continually forced to make difficult moral decisions that no human being should ever have to make. They soon discover that the real enemy is not the sinister pandemic, but the darkness within their very own hearts.

Unlike semi-goofy post-apocalyptic films like the Mad Max series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max-Special-Edition/dp/B00005R2IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max (Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior-Mad-Max-Beyond-Thunderdome/dp/B000NA1WGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</a>), ""Carriers"" is deadly serious from beginning to end. This works in the film's favor because if the filmmakers take the material seriously the viewer can as well.

One of the moral conundrums explored is what do you do if a loved one gets the disease? Since anyone with the disease is as good as dead, do you mercifully kill them? Leave them behind to suffer and die alone? Or stay with them, which is tantamount to suicide since you'll catch the virus as well?

The film also explores one's reaction to such a pandemic: Do we forsake all sense of morality in an attempt to survive -- lie, steal, forsake and murder -- or do we hold on to our moral compass, come what may? Is life worth living if you must become an immoral, wicked savage to survive? Isn't it better to live with dignity at all costs -- fight with nobility and die with dignity when and if we must?

""Carriers"" is to be commended for provoking such poignant questions.

Some denounce the film on the grounds that it's too downbeat and depressing, but wouldn't a lawless society with a highly contagious lethal virus on the loose be a very dire situation? In other words, the downbeat vibe reflects the reality of the story. This doesn't mean that every character has to be some moralless savage, as one of the main characters becomes, but it definitely makes the proceedings believable for the viewer. That said, I admit that I would have preferred if the film offered more glimpses of hope, faith and human dignity, but the filmmakers obviously wanted to explore the near-hopeless-situation element and the film should be accepted and respected on that level.

One obvious plothole is the perfectly maintained lawn of the golf course at the abandoned resort.

The film was shot in desolate regions of New Mexico & Texas and runs a short-but-sweet 84 minutes.

FINAL SAY: ""Carriers"" is an excellent -- albeit decidedly melancholic -- depiction of a post-apocalyptic world where conventional law & order are non-existent. The film successfully stimulates moral reflection and is engrossing from beginning to end. Although it looses points for being too downbeat...

!!ENDING SPOILER ALERT!!

...especially the climax. C'mon, the dude makes it to the remote beach and he has a hot lass at his side; they could be the new Adam & Eve, but all he does is whine like it's the end of the world or something.

What a bunch of unlikeable characters!!

Brian is a selfish jerk who steals a vehicle from a father trying to save his infected daughter leaving them later to die.  The father should have made the little girl potty right there by the car (blocking her from sight as much as possible) because HE KNEW they would drive away abandoning them if he left the car to take his daughter to the bathroom.  And, for a man concerned with saving his own life, Brain recklessly risks his life by wasting bullets which would be needed later and goofing off tipping over a golf cart/falling out and later almost falling off a pool diving board into infected water.

Bobbie, Brian's girlfriend, is compassionate and wants to help the little girl and her father.  She convinces Brian and the others to take them using plastic clear wrap or something to separate their seat from the others.  The father/daughter needed gas and used their car to block the road so when Brian's car came by, they would trade for gas for water.  Instead, Brian leaves them but returns after his oil pan leaks.  They use Brian's gas and the father/daughter SUV.  Bobbie later tries to help the girl when she is choking and the girl spit up on her giving Bobbie the disease.  The brother and his friend Kate convince Brian to abandon Bobbie like they did the father/daughter earlier.

Danny was supposed to the be compassionate brother compared to Brian but that was a lie.  They BOTH deliberately left their parents to die.  Danny also didn't stop Brian from driving away leaving the father/daughter and bother Danny and his friend Kate - another loser - convince Brian to dump Bobby.  He lies constantly to screw others over.  I can only HOPE that the starving dog that bit Danny when he broke into a farm house gave him rabies or that sickness because the dog was eating an infected body.  Danny tries to steal Brian's gun when Brian is running an infection from the bullet wound.  Danny and his friend Kate steal the gun, shoot Brian and abandon him.  I don't know why Danny got upset when his brother shots two women when he is as bad as his brother is.

Kate - a real loser.  Selfish to the core.  She is despicable and I hoped throughout the film she would get sick or hurt and die.  There is still hope she got sick from sitting next to Bobbie or gets sick from Danny who got splashed with infected dog blood and bit by that same dog that was eating infected bodies.

Ironically, after Brian/Kate/Danny steal the father/daughter car and abandon them and then later dump Bobbie, they need gas.  Brian cuts off the road from the 2 women driving in a car just like a desperate father did earlier to them.  The two women say no and Danny lies and says he is Christian and that his wife (no wife) is pregnant trying to convince them to stop when they were going to STEAL the gas or the car or both and abandon both women.  When the 2 women try to drive away, Brian shoots the driver dead.  It was GREAT when the passenger SHOOTS Brian in the kneecap before he shoots her.  Then Kate steals their gas and they leave them there to suffer and die slowly if they weren't dead already.

The disease can't be too infectious because they remove the keys from an ignition with a dead guy behind the wheel and the keys didn't infect them.  They sat next to Bobbie in the car for days when she was infected and didn't get infected.  Danny takes a rifle from an infected man's hands (in 2nd story of house) and didn't get infected.  But there is still hope that Danny and Kate still die.  Hopefully, they will.",1317427200,2,3591,4.457055214723926
3996952,4,B002VKE17U,"On the surface, Carriers appears to be a very shallow movie.  We have the typical road trip mix of daredevil jock (Chris Pine as Brian Green) and his loose girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo), nebbish nerd and Brian's brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), and pretty-but-distant blonde Kate (Emily VanCamp).  As the film progresses it becomes clear that the Greens stole the car, that they're on a road trip to a distant beach, and that asking ""alive or dead?"" when playing twenty questions is a ""trick question."" And that's the moment when we realize a plague has brought about the end of the world.

The brothers abide by three rules: 1) Avoid the infected at all costs because their breath is highly contagious. 2) Disinfect anything an infected person has touched in the last 24 hours.  3) The sick are already dead.

This is a movie about stupid people teetering on the brink of insanity. Brian's gung-ho exterior hides a scarred soul that has buried too many bodies.  Danny's cowardly quiet conceals a calculating intellect.  Bobby seeks refuge in the possibility of having children with Brian, while Kate tries every payphone she can find to call her family in the vain hope that the line still works...and that there's anyone left to call.  These are deeply flawed survivors who have only made it so far because they flee at a moment's notice.

In our fast-food, GPS-guided, mobile phone culture, our cars are oases in a sea of parkways. We have no idea who lives in the towns we pass through; the people we speak to at a rest stop or a restaurant we may never see again.  In Carriers, to stop moving is death, which is why rule number one is so important - in a world where everyone is infected, avoiding them means driving forever.

Early on, the four survivors encounter Frank Holloway (Christopher Meloni) and his infected daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka).  Frank is convinced that if he can just get his daughter to a CDC hospital she will be cured. The four initially flee Frank's vehicle, only to return to it when they ruin their own.  Frank and his daughter are the first of a series of ethical choices the group will have to make about how far they will take the rules. The decision to bend those same rules slowly tears the group apart.

When it becomes clear that there is no serum, no cure, and no hope, Frank - and the audience - faces the stark realization that life is not about survival.  It's about dying with dignity. As the doomed doctor at the CDC bivouac (Mark Moses) puts it, ""sometimes choosing life is just choosing a more painful form of death.""  But instead of facing that terrible truth, the survivors hop in the car and run, again...

This is probably the most depressing movie I've ever seen.  Children of Men and The Road are uplifting in comparison. Carriers may not have zombies, an antidote, or an uplifting ending, but it does have an uncompromising vision of an apocalypse that is truly personal. When the end comes, the foolish hop in their cars.  The wise hold their loved ones close and go out standing on their own two feet.",1316390400,19,3063,4.628465804066543
3996953,3,B002VKE17U,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such cannot comment on the audio or video quality of the disc nor the extras.  My review is concerned with the film's entertainment value only.

'Carriers' takes a limited, although interesting, one-track approach to the apocalypse genre, which is to ask the question, 'Are any relationships strong enough to trump survival?'.  In a world where a plague is in the process of wiping out the last remaining survivors, two brothers, along with their girlfriends, are attempting to reach the vacation spot they remember from childhood, while at the same time avoiding plague victims, and, just as dangerous if not more so, other survivors.  Chris Pine, as the older brother and default leader Brian, is forced to make increasingly more difficult moral decisions for the group as the film progresses, and though younger brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) struggles to maintain his humanity in the process, he is also finally forced to choose between survival and fraternal affection.

Production values and the competent young actors make this film stand out over many of the schlocky, B-movie efforts that dominate the post-apocalyptic genre, yet the movie's very slickness helps disguise 'Carriers' essentially superficial presentation.  The themes and questions are interesting in and of themselves - and asking them in this setting is an effective way of highlighting this aspect of human behavior.  Yet once the characters are established, the rest of the film follows in a predictable pattern to its conclusion.  In other words, the film goes no farther than raising the question in the viewer's mind of whether or not there are any ties that truly bind.  The film answers - not if you want to survive.

Films of this type don't have to ask and answer complex ethical questions - and simply as entertainment, 'Carriers' is above average for this genre.  Perhaps the best description of its overall value is that I remember that I was attentive and interested during the film, though now that a few days have gone by, many of the its images are starting to fade.  Satisfactory as a rental, especially for fans of the genre, but not enough depth - nor mayhem for those most interested in that aspects of these types of films - for multiple viewings.",1315267200,,2307,4.979166666666667
3996964,2,B002VKE17U,"It's hard to have sympathy for characters when you actually want them to die. And that's how I felt about the Green brothers Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Brian (Chris Pine), especially Brian. When you're one of the few people left alive after a major plague then driving stupidly all over the road is not what I'd do for fun. Nor stopping off at a golf resort to hit a few rounds.

Along with the Greens are their girlfriends Bobby (Piper Perabo) and Kate (Emily VanCamp)

Some reviewers have talked of the 'rules' the Green brothers come up with. They're great rules, however they're undermined by the fact that they don't follow them. They pick up Frank Holloway (Christopher Meloni) and his very sick daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka). Rule #1 broken. Sure they seal off with plastic the back of their car, but later when Jodie starts a coughing fit Bobby, instead of going around to the back of the car to give the girl oxygen lunges through the plastic knocking off her face mask so that the little girl coughs blood straight into her mouth. Rules #2-#5 broken there - and a glimpse of the problem with the film. All the 'drama' is caused by forcing situations to arise.

All of the drama is similarly convoluted.",1310256000,,1216,4.594470046082949
3996965,3,B002VKE17U,"As far as horror movies go (if you even consider this a horror movie) this takes a less hysterical approach and tries harder to dive into the hearts of people.

Here's the scoop. Some disease has wiped out most of the human race. The rest are either dying or trying not to become infected. Two brothers are trying to make their way, along with their female companions, back to 'Turtle Beach', the one place of which they have fond memories and a place that might make them feel safe.

The road is bumpy. Every person whose path they cross might be infected or might be hostile. Gas is in real short supply as is food and water. They do keep an ear to the radio for any broadcast that might offer some ray of hope, but they're doubtful. How far will they go? What will they do in order to survive? Their morals and good will are all put to the test in a series of encounters and none of them are pretty.

On the good side, the performances by all the leads are decent. You'll probably recognize many of the faces if not the names themselves. The situations are tense but not overly so. The writers/directors do a decent job of keeping things from getting too Hollywood. The production values, music, etc. are all good enough.

On the bad side, this needed something else. Something more. What these people experience and the decisions they need to make are pretty horrible. And though many of the scenes do pretty well in conveying this somehow, at the end of the day, I felt as though something were missing. The ending, particularly, felt a bit flat. Not really bad, but just a bit short.

This is not at all a bad watch, and at 84 minutes it won't try your patience. If you're into this sort of thing, there are worse ways to spend your time.",1304985600,,1744,4.37037037037037
3996966,4,B002VKE17U,"am not a fan of modern sci-fi so did not want to particularly see this, but I had friends over who had brought this and 2012. We watched the latter first and whilst it is a high octane, action fest amid an orgy of CGI it was ultimately uninspiring and vapid.

Then we watched the low budget CGI and action free zone that is 'Carriers'. This is nearly a brilliant film but for all the reasons that most lovers of the sci-fi horror genre will not like. This is the relatively short story of a group of four teenagers on a road trip to the coast in a post pan endemic afflicted world where (like 'Survivors')most of the worlds population has died or is likely to be dead any time soon. I can see why so many people felt disappointed with this film as it was billed as some sort of Zombie/ horror flick and actually is neither.

That is the backdrop but this is actually more of a moral study on how selfish and fragile we are as people. They are all rather unlikeable as characters but the more that comes out the more you can understand them. The two brothers are the central characters but the character development is done in tiny snap shot exchanges and you have to concentrate to pick it all up, there is little in the way of flash backs. Brian (the elder jock type - goes on to be the young Capt Kirk in one of the Star Trek spin offs) seems to be running away from the past as well as the disease and he is the alpha male who lays down the rules that ultimately mean they will all lose so were the rules right in the first place? Was anything right in the first place could be a secondary underlying question? But the human spirit certainly takes a kicking in this film, and you might need a cheer up afterwards. That said I found this totally watchable, and even a bit brave in the way it did not pander to the mid ground and very much like 'The Road' tries to show just how bad it would be and the heart rending decisions that you would need to do to survive. So I actually liked it, but so many people don't that you would probably be able to pick up one 'as new' from Amazon Market Place for a song.",1302566400,,2107,4.136585365853659
3996967,4,B002VKE17U,"Written and directed by the brothers lex and David Pastor this was their first film to get a large showing at the box office. While not the first project either of the two have worked on it easily proves that they know exactly how to put together a well laid out post apocalyptic film.

Set shortly after an unknown outbreak spread across the land killing a majority of the populace we follow a group of 4 friends (two brothers and their women they are dating) who are trying to reach an old beach house they know of which is so secluded they believe they can live there peacefully. One of my favorite aspects of this is we never see exactly the horrors of the outbreak - just the immediate after effects. It is not so far past the occurrence that everything has been looted, destroyed, or worn down due to time, but far enough that seeing other humans is rare. When we do see remnants of humanity - it's a world where clearly everyone is out for themselves.

We are introduced to Brian (Chris Pine) the outgoing brother, Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) who is more the brain to Brian's brawn, Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo), and the girl Danny is interested in Kate (Emily Vanvamp) and are easily shown who is who, their personalities, and how they interact with one another. It's four people in a very tense situation and they show how it can grate on their nerves and still have them come together. As mentioned above it's a very desolate area they are in and while they do meet up with 3 separate groups of people it is just to help advance the story - the story being our set of 4 friends.

Most post apocalyptic films take the easy way out and bring up zombies or man v man with everyone out for themselves. This story shows how the group progresses from trying to help others, to being harmed by others, to blatantly in one case on Brian's part just taking what they need. Even when this happens though the true fleshing out of both caring, understanding, and all of the `good' parts of human nature has not been left out. I am not going to focus much on the three groups of people they meet up with (aside to point out that less time is spent with each group as time goes on) aside from the first group as it was a father (Christopher Meloni) and his infected daughter (Kiernan Shipka.) These were the most interesting of the non-main characters in the film as Christopher's character is just a man who wants to save his daughter who won't take no for an answer and is able to do so with words while Kiernan, for being so young, was able to play such a perfect roll.

The movie knew how to bring up tension, show off human nature, and kill off important cast members without it seeming abrupt or without purpose. Everything fit well together and I cannot wait to see what the Pastor brothers put together next and can only hope that it is in the horror genre. If you are a fan of post apocalyptic films this is probably the best one created in 2009.",1301875200,,2959,4.374545454545455
3996968,4,B002VKE17U,"Compared to 28 Days Later or I am Legion, Carriers is not much of a horror film. There isn't much gore, not a lot of scary monsters chasing people. Rather the monsters are those few people who are left after a virus with a 100% kill rate has raced through the world like wildfire. Among the survivors are 4 young people, whose only goal is to get to the beach, the place where they were happy as children. Along the way, they have to overcome the problems that would arise with a worldwide epidemic--no gas, no electricity, infected people who are not yet dead, and so forth.

Where the film shines is in the relationships between the 4 kids, two brothers and their girlfriends. They are all well-drawn, complex characters with complex interactions. Their fear of being infected is matched by their fear that their moral sense has been distorted, that the will to survive has transformed them from good people into craven, immoral ghosts of their former selves. And this is very well done.

If you're expecting a loud monster movie with lots of chases and zombies, this isn't it. If you want to see 4 heartwrenchingly normal young people trying to deal with mortality and what it takes to survive, this is a very satisfying, if haunting movie.",1289865600,,1243,4.6454545454545455
3996969,4,B002VKE17U,"Well, it's not a zombie movie. However, it shares the same basic premise as most flicks from the ""infected"" sub-genre of zombie movies.

There's an infection. It's deadly. It's not well-explained. People are panicky, stupid, dangerous and potentially deadly (whether from a gunshot or from a cough). Everyone wants to find a safe haven and avoid getting dead. Everyone is in survival mode, squabbling over resources, etc. There is little hope in sight.

Like Zombieland and any number of ""infected"" movies, it's about a small group of people (two brothers and their girlfriends [or not]) traveling across the country, trying to find someplace safe to hunker down and ride out the course of the disaster. Along the way they meet a number of people, most of whom end up being at least somewhat adversarial. Over the course of the movie, most of the characters get dead...

This movie is largely about the characters, as such things go. So, it's at least partly a drama of interpersonal relationships during a biohazardous crisis, though it's mainly a horror/suspense movie. Not so much scary as mildly unsettling at times, and with some obviously disturbing imagery.

That said, it's pretty decent as far as such things go, without actually BEING a zombie movie. I had few complaints about it. I'd say it's pretty good and worth a watch or two.",1286409600,,1342,4.924778761061947
3996970,3,B002VKE17U,"More like 2 3/4 stars really

The plot - It's dooms day or pretty close. For this is a contagious virus end-of-the-world-zombie-movie with no zombies.  The suspense of zombie attacks has been replaced by the danger that one might at any moment catch a pretty bad virus and die a slow excruciating death. We, for the most part, are subjected to watching the antics of four incredibly, irresponsible, stupid and cantankerous protagonists. The only suspense comes from waiting to see which one of these very deserving folks will be the next to catch the disease due to multitude of dumb actions. This is pretty much the entire film.

This a good looking film and the director Alex Pastor can tell a story (in an annoying sort of way) and he keep things moving along (in an annoying sort of way). The film really does not look bad and even has a professional look and feel for a low budget indie horror film. There is a bit of cleverness here and there. I particular liked the opening sequence where the sky does a flip from the seashore to a desert road.

The actors (although no standout performances)are not without talent - as I do not believe it is the actors' faults that they are so very annoying - I believe the actors are for the most instructed to play a bunch of irritating dopes...that are...well...irritating.  And they do it very well.

For example: the four actors are required to behave on one hand like four people who's goal is do everything they can to survive and reach a safe destination and on the other hand behave like four drunks at a New Years Eve office party.  Ahh...that is one of the many rubs. For these two behaviors are a contradiction and watching these folks act out this contradiction gets on your nerves very fast. This also creates a big plot hole as you begin realize that there is no way that these jackasses could have survived as long as they have with their ludicrous behavior and minimal safety precautions.

Now for the next problem...how to say this without spoilers.  There is an awful lot of things that make no logistical or logical sense or are completely implausible.  There is also to many contrived dangerous situations which were obviously filler in order to pad out a very thin plot.  The diving board scene for one - the breaking into a boarded up house for another.  Climb on the roof? when the flimsy wood could have been easily removed from the front door and windows. OK, you'll know it when you see it.  There is also the fact that this disease is so damn contagious but the cheapest Lowe's dust mask and little Clorox is all you need for protection. Doesn't sound so bad to me.

The final problem - while I'm at it - is the ending - this is dark pessimistic movie - so if you going to do a dark pessimistic movie - you might as well go for a pay-off with a nice dark pessimistic twisty ending.  (Check out the film Shuttle for dark pessimistic twisty ending...or maybe better not) Anyway, I was really hopping for a knock-your-sox-off dark ending but instead the film peters out blandly with one of the characters (who we don't care about) waxing nostalgic in a long over dub.

OK I said allot of negative stuff about the film (did I mention that it kind of gave me headache?)  But if you like dooms day films, with a professional look, that are sometimes clever, with a little gore, and a Dawn of the Dead feel - then Carriers is not too bad.  Carriers can't hold a candle to 28 Days or The Dawn of the Dead films or either one The Crazies films but its light years better then that ludicrous Ebola film with Dustin Hoffman.

It eschews much in the way of an exploration of the condition that has decimated humanity, simply sketching out the scenario as background to the smaller scale human drama at its heart.  The four leads are all excellent--notably Chris Pine who plays Brian with much of the same bravado that he brought to the young Kirk in what was to be his next role--which is just as well given this is mostly a character piece.  As such it plays out its themes of compassion, euthanasia, responsibility and coming-of-age and explores just what kinds of actions and decisions it might take to survive in a post-apocalyptic society in which all the comforts and niceties of day-to-day life as we know it have gone to hell.  It's this approach to the drama and its unyielding execution that sets the movie apart from its otherwise familiar set-up of the road trip in flight from the end of the world, and as such makes it a worthwhile watch.

""Carriers"" is a movie that thinks much more highly of itself than I do. The standard fare is on display - a mysterious disease, for which there is no cure and little understanding, has ravaged humanity, leaving society completely devastated as governments crumble and social structures between people break down overnight. With social structures completely dissolved, it's obviously time for the inevitable raping, pillaging, suiciding, and so forth in order to make some sort of statement about the state of the human condition in the face of an apocalypse... which might be kind of innovative, except that it's already been done several times over, particularly with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blindness/dp/B001LLH8SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blindness</a>.

Derivative isn't bad - taking elements that have worked before and sticking them together in new and interesting ways is a tried-and-true, if unoriginal, way to make your movie. But ""Carriers"" seems to think sp highly of itself, with far too many ""you can't handle the truth"" speeches to drive how that, gosh, the apocalypse *sucks*, and the smug writing and contrived situations meant to show the downfall of the survivors' humanity just comes across as tired, forced, and poorly done compared to better offerings out there.

Now, a group of four young people, led by Chris Pine (STAR TREK) and his brother, are heading toward a childhood beach resort. They don't know what they'll find there, but at least it's a destination, a goal in the middle of total catastrophic chaos. CARRIERS is a very grim look at a dire situation. It's increasingly clear that this story cannot end on a positive note. We are taken along on this adventure as witnesses to the final curtain for our species. The growing horror of the subject matter is handled perfectly, as in RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR, we are not spared any of the tragedy or the irony of it all. There are no meandering, flesh-craving zombie hordes. No sci-fi scenarios or roving bands of post-apocalyptic road pirates. Nothing, save for disease, desperation, and death.

Fear and paranoia set in as a group of four find out that their precautions have failed and one of them has contracted the deadly disease, putting the others in immediate danger. CARRIERS does an amazing job at conveying a post-apocalyptic wasteland on a very modest budget. The ravished streets and empty buildings give a true sense of devastation on a grand scale. Each of the actors put forth strong performances as they balance the lighter moments in the script with the psychological struggles later on. What makes the film the most difficult to watch are the scenes involving the infected children, where the adults that are conscious of the terminal effects of the disease must make heartbreaking decisions in order to end their suffering. Unlike in 28 DAYS LATER, the infected only pose a risk of contamination rather than creating bloodthirsty monsters, which forces the plot to rely on the darker aspects of humanity to drive the tension and suspense. The biggest complaint would have to be the overall lack of direction or purpose that the film presents, along with its down ending. CARRIERS comes from the same line of paranoid cinema as its Independent brethren BUG and RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR, and makes for another solid entry in the Post-Apocalyptic sub-genre.

3996978,4,B002VKE17U,"""Carriers"" is not really a good title for this movie, because even though one look at the DVD cover makes it clear this is not about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-War-II-flattops/dp/B001LP33Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World War II flattops</a>, you still do not get a real sense what this 2009 film is about.  Once again most everybody in the world is dead and the focus is not on latter-day Thyphoid Marys but rather a quartet of survivors who are trying to make it from New Mexico to Texas to get to the beach.  In that regard it is similar to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road/dp/B001FB5634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road</a>,"" which I just happened to watch last week, but without the landscape being totally decimated and scavengers having already picked everything clean.  Packed into car are Brian Green (Chris Pine) and his brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), along with Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo) and a classmate of Danny's, Kate (Emily VanCamp).  Thoughts of being the next Adam and Eve have not popped up yet, and at this point the goal is survive and reach their destination, although it is just the beachhouse were the boys were happy as kids and not a true place of possible salvation.  But when Brian ennunciates the five rules by which he insists they live, everybody who has ever seen ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gremlins/dp/B000P0J0A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gremlins</a>"" or any of the hundreds of other films that takes as its dramatic impeteus the dictum that rules exist to be broken, knows what is going to happen between now and the end of the movie.

Written and directed by the Pastor brothers Alex and David, this movie is the series of encounters that the four have with other people.  Danny is the sort who things that human beings should look out for each other, but whereas he was to believe the glass is half full, brother Brian knows that proverbial glass is not just empty but broken beyond possible repair.  But Brian is such a disagreeable person that it is hard to take his pragmatic perspective, even though you know he is right (plus, there is the sense that it is the times that have tried Brian's soul and that he was not always this way).  Then again, kind-hearted Danny is not going to survive if he does not get a serious attitude adjustment.  To further complicate things, each brother is paired up with the wrong woman, because Bobby is the compassionate one and Kate the one who is deadly serious about the rules.  Something has to give between here and the Texas coast.  The most ironic line in the film is also the grimmest, when Bobby tells Brian, ""I think we need to start seeing other people.""  Tell me about it.

""Carriers"" belongs in the viral pandemic sub-genre of post-apocalyptic films, which puts it in the tradition of Stephen King's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stand/dp/B00006AUIN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stand</a>,"" and which also makes it a relatively rare exception these days to the zombie movies from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00005Y6Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>"" to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B002WY65VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>"" currently dominating end-of-the-world films.  With these latter films switching to postmodern zombies that are now quick and dead (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>),"" it is actually nice to get back to something relatively ""normal"" for the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it.  Ultiamtely, that is the main attraction for me in this film, because I like to be able to rumminate about what the hell would I do in such a situation, and I would rather deal with the problems presented by simple survival and debating the attempt to rekindle the spark of human kindness in others than having to contend with a geometrically progressing horde of speed racing evil dead.  The performances are decent enough, especially Perabo, and the majority of characters the quartet encounter on their journey come across as real human beings and not the psychopaths that usually populate such films.  The result is not great, but these days a solid movie comes across as being pretty good given the competition.",1275955200,,4595,5.88421052631579

It has a few ""zombie movie"" cliches - but for the most part, this is a really decent post-apocalyptic drama with a young cast lead respectably by Chris Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci. Those two play brothers who are driving a car (and stealing gas, etc.) to get to a beach where they think it'll be safe after some kind of terrible virus has swept out the world. I was mostly impressed with the acting (Pine especially is memorable) and the mood the film creates. I'd recommend to people who like drama with a bit of suspense thrown in. For horror fans, you could be disappointed unless you're in the mood for something quieter with less gore. This is also reasonably priced!",1275264000,,759,4.428571428571429
3996980,3,B002VKE17U,"In a nutshell ""Carriers"" is a George A Romeo film without zombies. Or maybe ""28 Days Later"" without undeads for that matter. The first feature film (by the Spanish-born lex Pastor and David Pastor) feels less like a horror movie than a character study drama, about ordinary people under the most horrific circumstances. This is not to say that ""Carriers"" is without scares. Also, the film has its own peculiar charm and the filmmakers did a cleaver job of creating a very bleak post-apocalyptic world within limited budget, but as you watch the film, you might get a strong feeling of dj vu all over again.

Meet four young travelers Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), Brian (Chris Pine), Bobby (Piper Perabo) and Kate (Emily VanCamp). They are actually survivors of a global pandemic and they know any physical contact with the ""carriers"" means death, which, it is suggested, a slow one. Now they encounter a father (Christopher Meloni) and his daughter (Kiernan Shipka) stranded on the desert road. Their best option is to leave and forget them. They could have done so if it had not been a small accident.

The rest of the film's story is fairly predictable. I don't reveal too much here, but suffice it to say that most episodes of the film have already been done in other end-of-the-world movies. I can also point out that Danny and Brian are brothers with very different personalities, a wild and reckless type and a silent and contemplative type. Actors did a fine job, but their journey's end is nothing surprising.

Some say people exhibit extraordinary courage and strength in facing great dangers. The Pastor brothers seem not to believe that. That is OK with me as long as the filmmakers provide something new. The beautiful cinematography of Benot Debie (""Irrversible"" ""Innocence"") is worth a look and fans of Chris Pine will enjoy watching his fine acting (the film was completed in 2007 before he became internationally famous as a new James T. Kirk), but ""Carrier"" is a thriller that is decent but a bit too familiar.",1272931200,,2024,4.827089337175792
3996981,2,B002VKE17U,"Carriers takes place shortly after a horrible new virus has devastated the United States (and presumably, the rest of the world), causing the infected to rot away while still alive.  They look like zombies, but they're not, and they don't come lurching after people to eat them; their ony danger is that they're highly infectious, so you don't want to be anywhere near them.  The movie follows four friends traveling cross-country in a van looking for a safe haven.

  First problem - the four characters.  I want to say that this isn't any fault of the actors, but these are four of the least sympathetic protagonists for any movie I've seen.  If it's the movie's intention to show that in this apocalyptic situation, the virus isn't the only threat, that the dark side of humanity is, they succeed, but they succeed too well.  Although there are a few likable characters here and there, their time is short-lived, as we find the four leads increasingly willing to go to any level of ruthlessness, to stoop to any low, and to turn on one another, to even marginally increase their chances for survival in an increasingly desperate situation.  It sounds like something that might have potential, that might come off as tragic, but they're just too willing to sacrifice anyone, to sacrifice their own loved ones, to sacrifice children, even when the threat to themselves is only suspected and not definate.  The movie may be trying to make some kind of statement about the state of the world, but if so, it doesn't really hit the target.  Any idea that there's a message behind this is only surmise, buried under a very nihilistic and gritty journey of four characters that one is pressed hard to care about.  And it's not just that they don't come off as 'good guys', because you can make a movie focusing on the bad guys and still have them interesting, with or without redeeming values.  It's a credit to the cast that they manage to turn in noticeably strong performances while playing characters who are neither likable nor interesting.

  Good points - this movie is very well made.  The acting, production values, special effects and all that are done well.  Chris Pine in particular turns in an impressive performance.  And the idea that this is trying to ask a question about the world - say, ""how far do we, and should we, go to protect ourselves from what may or not be a threat?"" or even ""from a real threat?""  There's potency in that, because it's a very valid question in a world where you have to weigh a lot of different factors, and would LIKE to do what's best for not just yourself but for everybody, but can't quite figure out exactly what that is.  In the example portrayed in this movie, the characters seem to end up attaching huge importance to their own chances for survival (even if it's just extending their life by one more day), a vastly smaller amount on the lives of those closest to them, and none whatsoever for the lives of strangers.  This might have been an effective characterization for 1 or 2 characters, but for ALL the main players?

  So it's quite depressing.  Not sad or tragic, just depressing, there's a big difference.  And although it's clearly a horror movie, it's not scary or suspenseful either, at least not to me.  Those into ultra-gritty dramas about humanity's dark side, or very into movies that serve as cautionary tales about that dark side, might find Carriers a bit more appealing than I did.  Also, if you just want to watch something to see a fine cast do a great job with very difficult material, this isn't a bad pick.  For me personally, the nihilistic/depressing aspects just too completely overwhelm everything else.  On the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the techical aspects of the show, and if a 'cautionary tale' is what they were going for, then they to some degree succeed.  So just because I wasn't that into this one, doesn't mean others won't like it more.  Personally though - not exactly a favorite, but not the worst either.",1272326400,2,4009,4.6814285714285715

3996983,3,B002VKE17U,"Carriers: 6 out of 10: What amazes me about Carriers is how it has the exact same plot as Zombieland. A story about two siblings traveling across a devastated and depopulated United States to visit a theme park in California that reminds them of childhood. The movies even share the same fetish for a nerdy character that has come up with all the rules to keep them alive.

While Zombieland was filmed in early 2009 and released later that year on 3000 plus screens; Carriers was filmed in 2006 and released on a hundred screens in 2009 to virtually no fanfare. Only actor's Chris Pine's recent starring role in the Star Trek movie caused it to be released theatrically at all.

The other main difference is while Zombieland on the surface may appear to be a horror-comedy along the lines of Shaun of the Dead it really is more of a straightforward comedy with gore and zombies. Carriers also certainly appears to be a horror film on the surface but it really isn't. This is large D drama that starts off serious and gets quite disheartening before the end credits role.

Carriers is a medical drama writ large mixed with a post-apocalyptic future. There are no zombies or even 28 Days Later pseudo zombies. This is not an exploitation film as there is no nudity nor violence; there is also very little action. There is simply a small handful of sick people, a small handful of not yet sick people and a copious amount of dead people. It is more a sequel to a bird flu movie than a Dawn of the Dead film.

Carriers biggest problem is it simply is hard to root for any of the characters. Chris Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci play the siblings heading to their childhood vacation spot (of which we see strange seventies era super 8 nostalgia footage though judging by the age of the characters their childhood was in 1995). Pucci is the rules nerd while Pine is a super jerk (or as TV Tropes wisely points out a Psycho Party Member).

Then you have the ladies. Emily VanCamp plays what would seem to Pucci's girlfriend but she is frigid, preppy, and possibly a lesbian. At the very least the ""I wouldn't kiss you if you were the last man on earth"" rule seems to apply here. Piper Perabo as Pine's girlfriend is borderline likable but she is whiny and a liar and I really am grading on a curve here.

Only Christopher Meloni as a father with an already sick daughter seems to pull on the heart strings; but he isn't a member of the core group and they separate ways halfway through.

The acting is good across the board with Meloni and VanCamp the standouts. The film also seems much grounded in its reality and logic is safely tucked into bed every night. I simply wish the movie was about a different group of survivors.",1270252800,,2714,4.47070707070707

The acting was decent, I'll say that. It at least had a few recognizable faces and they gave a good performance. The script was ok, and the plot was a bit sluggish. The production values were nothing to complain about nor the special effects. The story line as a whole just missed the mark and needed more substance, less predictability. It undoubtedly referenced several other movies, leaving hard core genre fans with nothing new to experience.

Basic premise is that four travelers are attempting to hit a possibly safe/tucked away location from the lead character's childhood - all the while trying to steer clear of infected people. Naturally, this proves hard to do.

One of the things you notice about this film is that the cast is very strong and very believeable. These are just regular people who are just trying to survive as society completely disintegrates and the rules change.  The director made smart choices in my opinion with no few special effects - and thus making the film simply more realistic, barren, and terrifying.  The film raises the question of what would you do if faced with the same situation? And it does make you think.

Choices and rules are difficult and they have to be. Chris Pine is very strong in the lead role and it's a great change from his role as Jim Kirk. He still is very charming at times but also reveals he can go the distance emotionally.

3997017,4,B002VKE17U,"I picked this up on a whim. It seemed right up my alley, but I was surprised that I had never heard of it before, especially since it stars the new Captain James Tiberius Kirk. My expectations were very low. Seemed like it was going to be a cheap little independent film with no substance. But I was wrong: it's a cheap little independent film that's actually pretty smart.

The premise is a tad cliche. It takes places after a devastating and extremely-contagious virus has decimated the planet. We never get an explanation for the outbreak or how our main characters have survived up until now--true to post-apocalyptic form. I would agree that sometimes it's a pain when a filmmaker tries to explain everything when the audience can usually fill in the blanks themselves, but still, we're getting to the point were it's expected.

The story itself follows four young adults: two brothers and their respective girlfriends. They're on their way to a beach that the brothers used to frequent in their younger days, and doing their best to scavenge for food and gas enroute. Semi-weak premise, semi-weak story, and semi-weak characters. Luckily, the writing and directing are good enough to see this movie through all 85 minutes of its running time.

For the most part, it's all about the little encounters along the way to this beach of theirs. The people that they meet and the situations that they get themselves into during their most desperate times play out very well. It starts out kind of slow, but it finds its feet fast enough. These encounters are very tense and well shot. And they very expertly provide us post-apocalypse aficionados with what we always look for in a movie like this: Situations that force us as viewers to question how we would handle such a thing. Would we really resort to such strict utilitarianism, or would we do ""the right thing?"" They're interesting to think about, to me, at least.

So, for a rental, I certainly think I got my money's worth. The ending was rushed and ill-conceived, which was extremely unfortunate, since it deterred me from thinking of purchasing it. This is a shame, since halfway through, it was almost looking like America's answer to 28 DAYS LATER. Better characterization, a better ending, and a longer running time would have made this a winner. The directors are definitely talented, and I hope they consider making a sequel of some kind.

Maybe four stars is a little high, but this movie was great for what it was. It was short, had some great moments, and it's one of the better movies in the genre to have been released lately. It's definitely worth the rent, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",1264723200,,2667,4.764069264069264
3997018,5,B002VKE17U,"Though clearly the victim of distribution company turmoil, the impressively despairing ""Carriers"" would've been commercial poison even if properly released. Some reviewers evidently believed this was a zombie movie, and, had it been widely released, the promotion would surely have sold ""Carriers"" as such despite the absence of any zombies. That crucial absence aside, ""Carriers"" is rooted in the tradition, but from a more thematic perspective. Though there's no danger from the living dead, the quartet of travelers in ""Carriers"" live in a world after civilization, where paranoia rules and even the slightest contact with the infected can bring death. Unsurprisingly, this makes ""Carriers"" much less action-oriented than a zombie flick and heavier on the existential despair. As much as I like zombie movies, I've always felt the genre moved too far from the grim atmosphere of ""Night of the Living Dead."" and ""Carriers"" gives the viewer more than enough of that even as it jettisons the subgenre's core.

Co-directors/writers Alex and David Pastor wisely avoid any background and immediately throw the viewer into a near-future world of despair. We open on the road in America's southwest following a pair of brothers. We have the older, harsher Brian (Chris Pine) and more sympathetic and sensitive Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci). With them are two females, Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo) and the rather faceless Kate (Emily Van Camp), who is evidently a recent arrival to the group. A nameless plague has wiped out society, and the group travels in a moving quarantine, sterile masks on, tubs of bleach available to wash away the pestilence. Brian has devised a series of rules to survive the apocalypse, with one central rule: ""The infected are already dead."" And since it's nearly impossible to say definitively that someone is not infected, this proves to be a substantial strain on interaction with those outside the group. Merely surviving is something of a chore, but the four also have a goal: to return to an abandoned, coastal hotel the brothers frequented as children and wait out the end of the world.

The film's narrative is fairly thin and episodic, and ""Carriers"" is primarily a mood piece. As such the film is consistently low-key, with sharp but never flashy cinematography and a generally moody, understated score. Pics like ""28 Days Later"" (the most obvious recent influence) prefer to display the vast emptiness of the dead cities, but ""Carriers"" remains mostly in the open, emphasizing with endless, lifeless expanse ahead and behind. The wasted cities mean nothing to them because they have fled humanity, have escaped from civilization altogether. Nevertheless, a few other refugees remain, and here is where the conflict begins. As is often the case in such films, the conflicts are often moral: early on the quartet meet Frank (Christoper Meloni) and his obviously infected daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka). First they leave the pair alone in the middle of the road but, after their car fails them (with a little help from the enraged Frank), the quartet return, taking Frank's SUV and stuffing him and the sick little girl in back, sequestered behind a thick plastic sheet, promising to take her to receive an experimental treatment. This is actually the most accommodating encounter depicted in the film, and the struggle for gasoline and safety often turns suddenly violent.

As is common to zombie and post apocalyptic films, the question as to whether human decency can survive under such circumstances is key to the film. The answer is, as it almost always is in such films, ""no,"" but ""Carriers"" treats this question in a bleaker and more intelligent way than most. While too many films glibly suggest that the end of law turns men into fascists, ""Carriers"" acknowledges a darker truth: under the worst circumstances, the choice between callousness and decency is the choice between life and death. Callousness, rather than hatred or violence, is the defining characteristic of the survivor: they are inclined not so much to brutalize the others, but instead to leave them behind, to simply drive away while the other stands alone on the empty highway with nothing but desert for miles in every direction. (W/o giving too much away, one particular abandonment scene has got to be one of the worst gut-punch scenes I've come across in recent memory.)

In spite of the emphasis on mood, ""Carriers"" still contains some fine set pieces. There's one fantastically eerie scene in an abandoned hospital and a somewhat clichd but still effective confrontation between the travelers and a trio of HazMat suit bedecked survivalists. Nevertheless, the climax moves for a more low-key, dialogue-oriented approach, and while the conclusion is perhaps a bit on the nose precise, it has a real emotional impact.

In spite of my praise for the film, I can hear the critics' responses: ""Too slow, story too thin, too derivative, thin characters etc."" These criticisms aren't w/o merit. Though it is a reconfiguration of old tropes, precious little is truly new, not that much happens and the characters other than the brothers can be a bit thin. (The solid performances across the board, particularly from Perabo and Meloni, add humanity to sometimes underwritten characters.) More important than the limitations, however, is the totality of the film. ""Carriers"" is a tapestry of despair, with virtually every element builds towards this goal, all w/o much violence, any real gore or much melodrama. This is perhaps not what most viewers want, but it makes for an affecting experience.

It's a disease...that makes you rot slowly...or something. It's never explained, which can work but doesn't in this case.
My main problem is with the characters; they're not likeable or hateable- just there. Older brother is loud and dominating, younger brother is a wimp on all levels (until he's forced to not be), and the two girls are dumb even by horror movie standards.
The ending, also, made me cringe. First off, voice-over endings are weak. Secondly, younger brother goes on a rant of how alone he feels. It may have worked had he actually been alone at the beach. But no, a girl was there. And a good-looking one. STOP WHINING!!!
Anyway, I'll definitely give this another shot once it comes on HBO, so then I can really make my mind up about it knowing what to expect. But on first viewing it seems like Carriers falls into the category of ""could/should have been good, but fell short.""",1264550400,,1294,4.4411764705882355

3997024,5,B002VKE17U,"What would you do if the humanity started to die all around you? Would you curl up in a ball and hope for the end, or would you make a run for something comforting, knowing that the world is going to dissolve anyway? That's the problem that we find two brothers and their companions facing as they track into the great wide open, because the world has indeed been flushed down the cosmic potty. It has no rules, either, and it has nothing to quarantine that tomorrow will truly come. The only thing that seems to work, at least in our group's favor, is rules. Clean - a lot whenever you touch anything. If a person becomes infected, they are dead.  Do not mourn the dead and do not come in contact with them. Do not break these rules (and I am, of course, paraphrasing). These sound good, right? The problem is that there is a real world out there, and the real world has little kids and nice people and shortages all around. What would you be willing to do to make it to the place that you have always dreamed of going?

When I picked up Carriers, I thought I was picking up one thing but picked up something totally different altogether. Instead of your typical ""end of the world"" scenario, you find yourself riding shotgun with four people - with four personalities - as they try to do the best they can while approaching a dream two brothers still share. It involves childhood and a beach and the fact that, once there, the two can never die. The problems come quickly, however, and they are relentless. First, they run into a dad and a little girl who need their help. What do they do? They have someone get infected. What value does love have? Things like this keep on coming and, sometimes, hell is paved with the best of intentions. And breaking the rules, well, that seems to be a good way to end up on a slab.

When acting in a movie like this, you really have to sell the part you are playing. That seems to be the thing that divides B-movies from the big kids and it also seems to be the thing that keeps the momentum from falling by the wayside. I have seen that happen in quite a few movies and was scared that it could happen here but, much to my surprise, Carriers pulls off some amazing things. It takes something that is simply about a sickness killing everyone and it makes you think and feel. It also showed you the dark side of caring and what not caring can do to you, giving you the duality that is really the a-bomb inside the Cheerios. I liked that, too, because I thought that everyone could relate to something inside the film.

If you are expecting a lot of violence, chuck that out and think of something fresh. Instead of smelling the flowers think of a new arrangement altogether, where the world intruders and the world excludes but where the canvas is totally unique. It is death that is coming from somewhere that nobody really understands and, in that context, it is unlike anything that we have seen in a while. There are no undead or plague-riddled things spreading the virus. There are simply people - children and parents and doctors and teachers - and they are all dying. And it is consuming the world, almost assuring you that you will die as well. That's the thing about the movie - there is no happy ending. There is only the now and, in the end, we see what the now can cost us as humans. It is beautiful and poetic and sad, too, and I personally found that almost overwhelming.

I loved that about Carriers - it made me feel and it made me think about when another day of breathing would stop being worth the cost. Watched with an open mind, I think you would enjoy it as well.",1262649600,,3622,4.336283185840708
3997025,4,B002VKE17U,"We got this because Chris Pine, the new Captain Kirk was in it. I can say he certainly doesn't play the hero in this one!

The story is a depressing take on one version of the apocalypse, where disease is the main culprit. However, the way the humans act toward each other is far worse than the disease. This was also similar to the quote on the back of the movie box. Many times those quotes seem to have little to do with the actual movie, but this time, they got it right.

None of the characters are all that likable, so when one bites it, it is no big loss. And in the end, the survivors could have been any one of them and it wouldn't have mattered. Just the fact that some of them made it to the end is good enough.

I hate it when the hero dies, but in this case, there really isn't one, just a group of four people trying to get someplace safe.

Overall, this was a decent movie, especially being only +/- 85 minutes. It was short enough that it didn't have time to drag. Very well done. Recommended.",1262563200,,1009,4.106598984771574

In October, Paramount released this long-shelved project in theaters for one week. This is a thinking man's version of the viral story we've seen many times. Intense. Character-driven, practically no dead bodies in sight and no one getting chased or bitten. It stars four up-and-coming young actors (you've seen them all in other stuff since this was made). Unwavering in story, resolute in getting into your brain, unyielding with possibilities. I give this film a big thumb's up.  The trailer doesn't do the film justice. It's really about 4 people who are faced with a situation that changes each of them and the dynamics amongst them. Again and again. I literally stopped it for a few minutes I was so struck by it. I'd say it's in my top 5 movies of this year. And I see a lot of movies.  Fans of the psychological thriller ""The Ruins"" would adore this film.",1261612800,,1005,4.704545454545454

Of course they run into logistical trouble: gasoline runs out and can be had only through complicated social acts like carjacking and murder. They have defined rules: if one falls ill, he will be left behind. The sick are dead.
Of course this will be one of the drivers of the conflicts.
This film is unusually smart for the genre. It stays on the small scale and shies away from murderous zombie hordes. It ends in a dead end, predictably, and no answers are given.

3997028,3,B002VKE17U,"Not a terrible movie but it falls short of its potential.  The cast of young actors are talented and deserved a better script but as is so often the case with such ""end of the world"" scenarios, the movie industry demands a certain formulaic plot line. I suspect that even a 1970's existentialist would have problems with the ""hell is other people"" unspoken subplot of the movie and I wonder how much of that was intentional on the part of the writers. When roaches are shown, they can't be just ordinary roaches but have to be what I think was giant Brazilian roaches because they look so much more yucky than say an ordinary North American roach. Forget the fact that they don't exist in the wild in the USA. It's a little detail but it speaks to the general attitude of those who made the movie. Poor Chris Pine is saddled with the role of the ""dumb"" (read didn't go to college) brother who is however tough and street savvy and acts like an idiot even in the face of incomparable human destruction because that's what Hollywood (?) seems to think movie goers want to see in such a movie and believe people would act like in such circumstances. There are moments in the film that work (I'm not writing this review to be a spoiler so I won't name them) but with the talent of the cast it could have and should have been much better.",1261267200,,1333,4.375

3997032,4,B002VKE17U,"Brian and Danny grew up as two brothers who were relatively close to one another. They cherish the memories they have of Turtle Beach, a beach their family vacationed to every summer. The abandoned motel in Turtle Beach may be their best bet of surviving the highly contagious disease that now plagues the entire country and possibly the world. Not much is known about the virus other than the victims coughing up blood and bleeding from the ears as their condition worsens. Brian actually came up with a few rules that will hopefully get him, his girlfriend Bobby, his brother Danny, and Danny's friend Kate through this disease ridden world to Turtle Beach clean. The rules include avoiding the infected at all costs, disinfecting anything they've touched in the past 24 hours, and that the infected are already dead as there is no cure. You may survive if you stick to the rules, but actually abiding by them is an entirely different story.

Right off the bat, people are probably going to compare Carriers to Zombieland because of the rules. Carriers was released a full month before Zombieland, but Paramount Vantage folded upon its initial release causing its wide release to be an extremely limited one at the last minute (I think it wound up playing at only two theaters in the country). Expectations rise unintentionally in situations such as this. ""This is that horror film that was practically shelved earlier this year and is finally being released."" The result is a horror film that is well worth watching, but may not be entirely what you're expecting.

Carriers is more about establishing an atmosphere than anything else. Everything is abandoned and rightfully so as most people were picked off handfuls at a time by this pandemic. The entire film is more like the first half hour of 28 Days Later where Jim wakes up in an abandoned hospital and realizes how empty the streets of London are. There aren't masses of the infected running around lusting for brains or wanting to tear humans apart in Carriers. The story follows these four friends as they journey across the country to this supposed sanctuary where they hope to tough it out until this disease runs its course. Carriers is more of a slow burn as things turn from bad to worse very slowly and snowball as the film goes on.

Chris Pine is really the drawing factor of the film. His role as Brian is kind of like a more intense version of his role as Kirk in Star Trek from earlier this year. Brian comes off as an inconsiderate prick the first half of the film and seems to only do things that benefit himself. The second half is where his character gets interesting though. The speech he gives Danny about their parents and telling Danny that he only told him what he wanted to hear is the turning point for Brian. Chris Pine shines as things begin to roll downhill for Brian as his emotions take center stage and his true demeanor is revealed.

Everything else in the film pretty much feels like routine manuevers when it comes to films revolving around viral outbreaks as some main characters contract the disease, they resort to drastic measures to survive, and begin to question their humanity along the way. The most disappointing part of the film is the ending as things just seem to kind of stop without much of a resolution. It seems like films like this either end this way or have a really depressing ending and that's its biggest flaw. Movie buffs who have seen films concerning pandemics already have a rough idea of how the film is going to end and it's about time to mix that up a bit. There's got to be a decent way to end the film that offers something a bit different that could wrap everything up until that point, but also leave enough room open for a sequel if need be.

Carriers may be a bit slow at first and doesn't really offer anything you probably haven't seen before in a film like this, but is still worth seeing for Chris Pine's performance. It's kind of a more serious take on Zombieland without actual zombies running or stumbling around with an atmosphere similar to the one established in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later. If you're a fan of films involving a virus that has wiped out most of the human population, then this is still worth a watch.",1260835200,52,4254,4.621693121693122
3997033,4,B002VKE17U,"Usually when a distributor dumps a movie into a handful of theaters with little to no screenings, it usually winds up being a dreadful waste.  Not so with Carriers, which winds up being a surprisingly taut, and incredibly bleak, take on the whole pandemic outbreak theme.  Written and directed by the Pastor brothers, Carriers revolves around a group of survivors (Lou Taylor Pucci, Chris Pine, Piper Perabo, and Emily VanCamp) traversing the hazardous land and following a set of rules that is helping keep them alive.  A chance encounter with a stranded motorist (Law & Order: SVU and Oz vet Christopher Meloni) begins to change all that however, as things start to go from bad to worse for everyone involved.  One may think that Carriers is all about zombies and such just by viewing the trailer alone, but it isn't, yet it still manages to leave a mark upon the viewer as an engaging, albeit slow-moving, horror/thriller.  The surprising standout here is Pine, hot off the success of playing Captain Kirk in Star Trek, who gives a just plain fantastic performance.  All in all, Carriers may not be the 28 Days Later-style zombie thriller that you may be expecting (like I was), but that aside, it is wholeheartedly worth your time.",1260403200,2,1235,4.829383886255924

It's true that it's not an action filled zombie apocalypse but even the slow parts are full of tension and suspense and humanity...or the lack of. The threat feels real and viable.
.
 It's biggest fault, to me, is it's nihilistic view of human nature. It makes one wonder that if life should come to this if it would even be worth saving or even living. And this is the question that really gave me pause. What is it that makes life worth living and how much of that can be sacrificed and still have the fortitude or desire to carry on. What's it worth?

 I saw this before Chris Pine was a household name and I wondered if his pretty good looks would hamper his success. I'm glad to see it didn't. But his character in this is pretty detestable and unlikable and that never really changes. The rest of his group are varying degrees of restless under his leadership. He's not one to hesitate with sentiment or empathy. He's cold and matter of fact about his mission to survive and there's no room for error. Others have trouble with resisting their humanity but not his character.
