8739223,4,B017HFTVZK,"Underground,"" winner of the Palme dOr at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, is a tale of wartime profiteering and betrayal. During World War II, two Belgrade gangster-patriots, Marko and Blacky, make their living on the black market by stealing arms to sell to the Yugoslav Partisans in their fight against the Nazis. They even install a number of refugees in Markos cellar where they manufacture the guns that are sold to the Communists. They run guns, steal gold, get rich, and fall for the same woman, an actress named Natalie. Their mutual attraction to Natalija threatens their relationship.

Fifteen years pass and the war is over, but Marko lies to his compatriots, claiming the war continues. He becomes one of Titos righthand men while keeping Natalija to himself and locking Blacky in an underground cellar, trying to convince him that, with the war still raging, Blacky is safer to be hidden. This deception lasts for ten years.

Director Emir Kusturica opens the film with Marko and Blacky loudly celebrating the latters joining the Communist party and continues through a bombing raid over Belgrade zoo and, fifty years later, the Bosnian slaughter. The movie contains shocking images, and memorable moments, including a romantic abduction, a chimpanzee in a tank, slapstick torture sessions, unsuccessful hangings, and lust-driven dances. Director Kusturica lambastes the idea of national heroism through the often clownish Marko and Blacky, but also imbues the film with a feeling of melancholy loss and yearning for the old, multicultural country that split apart. He balances farce, deep-felt grief, fantasy and graphic, bloody horror.

Bonus features on the 3-disc widescreen Blu-ray + DVD release include Once Upon a Time There Was a Country, a 6-part TV version of Underground; a booklet containing a critical essay; Shooting Days, a 1996 documentary on the making of Underground; behind-the-scenes footage; interviews with cast and crew; and trailer. The film is in Serbo-Croat, with optional English subtitles,",1519171200,2,2028,5.311526479750778
