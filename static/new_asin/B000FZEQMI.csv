2593412,4,B000FZEQMI,"it was still worth watching. I've only seen the original movie (not the english voice over since that doesn't come out until 8/1/2006) There's not enough Sesshomaru in my opinion and there is a lot about Inuyasha and Kikyo's past, but the story itself is really well done. The 3rd movie's my favorite, but that's because of Sesshomaru's storyline. (in my opinion only of course) I like that it doesn't have Naraku. That's always a plus! lol.",1150416000,5,441,4.740259740259741
2593413,3,B000FZEQMI,"This movie was truly a side story, having nothing to do with the chase to track down the jewel.  It goes a bit more into Inuyasha's and Kikyou's past, but nothing that is relevant to the overall series.  It was a decent enough story overall, but i felt like the plot was being based on facts they were just pulling out of their [...] in order to fill an hour. The animation itself was up to the level as the same 3 movies before it.  Music good.  Overall, if ya wanna see a good inuyasha movie, i'd stick with movie 3 that they made.",1150156800,6,533,4.096153846153846

2593441,4,B000FZEQMI,"My daughter loves this entire anime, so she decided to get the rest of the movies. When it came in the mail, yes it was sealed, but the disc was loose in the case and there were scratches on it. We weren't sure it would play, but so far so good! No problems. Over all, my daughter loves it! Very happy with her purchase",1452729600,,319,4.0
2593442,5,B000FZEQMI,"If you are a fan of the TV series, then you'll enjoy the movie.  As of now (Jan 2016) there are 4 movies that I know of.  This is the 4th movie.  Although this is the worst movie out of the 4, it is still a good movie...just did not live up to the other 3 movies.

This movie has a storyline all on its own so you can watch it anytime you want.  There is no specific place to view this if watching the TV series.  However, I do recommend watching this movie after watching season 7.  Here's why.  In the series, in episode 157 ""Destroy Naraku with the Adamant Barrage"" Inuyasha gains a new ability with his sword.  This ability, called adamant barrage, is used in the movie.  (I purchased this movie long before I ever saw season 7, so I was lost as to how the technique came to be.)  Other than this, there is no finite place in the series to view the movie.  Naraku is not in it anywhere and neither or any other foes from the TV series.

The movie has a plot all on its own.  You will need to know the crazy love triangle between Kikyo, Iniyasha, and Kagome.  Before placing him under the curse for 50 years, Inuyasha and Kikyo visited a mysterious island filled with half demon children.  The island is ruled by 4 demons who call themselves gods.  If they mark a demon (or half demon) than he can never escape from the island.  Sesshormaru was marked as well, so he gets involved.  Over all, the movie is good.  I did find it interesting that the first 3 movies are approximately 100 minutes long while this one is only 90 minutes long.

So if you enjoy the TV series give this movie a try.",1451952000,,1594,4.160655737704918

2593467,4,B000FZEQMI,"I love the themes this movie deals with, e.g. what it's like to be the ""other"" or ""outsider"" through the perspective of a half-demon, and I thought it was so interesting that it contained some flashback scenes of Inuyasha and Kikyou working together before their betrayal - we don't get to see that very often! But as I learned (especially throughout The Final Act ;-; ), they have a real chemistry and history together that is more complex and more layered than just ""boy meets girl. Girl lightly chastises boy for being bad with no real threat in her voice. Boy gives girl lipstick. They fall in love but don't live happily ever after (or at all, as the case may be)."" It's cool to see a bit of their past where they are working together and collaborating and adventuring and exploring and moving towards the future they once believed they could have.

That said... Don't get the Instant Video edition unless you are prepared to watch the dub! I know it lists the Japanese voice actors in the information for the movie - even specifically for the Instant Video edition - but there is NO OPTION to switch the audio. It is the dub, and only the dub. Believe me, I checked everything. You can't switch it. Super disappointing.... not a fan of the dub over here. So. Unless you are okay with the dub, you're better off buying the DVD version! Sorry guys. Amazon.... be better.",1439164800,2,1374,4.540322580645161

2593504,5,B000FZEQMI,"I'm a regular devoted InuYasha fan and very much enjoy the fourth movie. The only thing I have to say that isn't in concerns to the movie itself is that, this item should NOT be displayed with the stickers on it say there is a cell phone charm and card inside. The card was there but no cell phone charm. It also did not state at the time of my purchase that it was only available by third-party sellers. It would have been nice to know that as the one I received was used. If you're planning on buying this movie try a seller that isn't third-party. The movie itself is amazing. Through the duration of it, InuYasha actually has zero idea that his brother Sesshomaru is on the same island for the same reason. The plot is that five of six half demon kids are stuck on an island that only appears once every 50 years. The kids are bound by the mark of the four War Gods; a mark that both InuYasha and Sesshomaru received at separate times. The mark drew both of them back and it is InuYasha and his companions' mission to free the kids from their fate of being sacrificed.

I won't spoil the WHOLE movie. You'll have to watch it yourself if you haven't. It's filled with action, love, and the usual InuYasha you know and love. It's a great movie.",1421971200,,1246,4.257383966244726

2593529,4,B000FZEQMI,"I liked this movie but the other 3 Inuyasha movies were way better. I mean this movie was shorter than the others plus it seemed to me after watching the Final Act that this movie seemed just like a long ass episode of Inuyasha and not a ""movie"". It was still good though even though it was kind of predictable but I guess that's to be some what expected because everyone knows that Inuyasha is going to win in the end every time.",1367539200,,430,4.192771084337349
2593530,5,B000FZEQMI,Enjoyed the story line plus epic fighting action between Inuyasha and his enemy's on the fire mystic Island. Totally worth ordering this movie on Amazon.com..,1362355200,,158,5.36

He has come to free the children from the tyranny of the war gods. His past also waits for him on the island.

This is another excellent Inuyasha movie. It has great characters, a touching story, great animation, and awesome fight scenes. It is in 5.1 Dolby Digital, and is about 90 minutes long. This is the final Inuyasha movie. At least I think so. It's November 21st and I just got the final act today and am now watching it as I type. I don't know how the series ends, and don't deny that more Inuyasha movies are possible. Anyway, this movie is awesome and a must have for Inuyasha fans.",1353456000,,769,4.267123287671233

2593543,3,B000FZEQMI,"Fire on the Mystic Island is the fourth and final theatrical film in the Inuyasha franchise.  In the film, Inuyasha, Kagome, and their friends must try to save the half-demon children who are trapped on Horai Island.

The DVD release for the film has four special features.  First is a link labeled ""Special Footage.""  It's a feature that runs a little over eleven minutes.  The first seven minutes are a ""Collection of Memorable Scenes.""  The Japanese voice actors chose a favorite scene that their character appeared in.  The last three minutes are a ""Collection of Memorable Lines.""  First, the Japanese voice actor for each character chose their favorite line, and the scene with the line is shown.  This is then followed by the staff and cast pick for that character.

Next is a collection of the Japanese trailers for Fire on the Mystic Island.  There are nine trailers in all, and the feature runs for about three-and-a-half minutes.  The clean opening and ending credits are included; between the two, this feature runs for roughly ten minutes.

The final special feature is a line art gallery, which is broken up into three sections: Main Characters, Guest Characters, and Location Sketches.  There are fifty-five pages of Main Characters, thirty-seven pages of Guest Characters, and fifteen pages of Location Sketches.

Overall, Fire on the Mystic Island is a very good film.  At 87 minutes, the runtime of the film is perfect for the story being told.  This DVD should be in the collection of anyone who appreciates the Inuyasha anime series.",1254182400,,1553,4.957364341085271

2593546,5,B000FZEQMI,"Inuyasha is what started my obsession with anime and manga. I have everything humanly passable that has to do with inuyasha including the whole show, movies, manga, soundtracks, posters, action figures, t-shirts, calendars, playing cards, art books, animanga from japan, bookmarks... you mane it i have it.
so with all my extensive obsession all i have to say is treasure this movie, it is the last of the animation there is. after the show ends and that doesn't mean it ends, (the show stops and the equivalent of manga #36 and in japan they are up to about #51) this movie, in japan, came out after the final episode. although it dose not continue with the main story it is a good installment based on before inuyasha was ever sealed to the sacred tree and how he will help kiko with her priestess obligations. great animation and fun fights, a must have for the obsessed!",1191628800,,874,4.645161290322581
2593547,1,B000FZEQMI,if you like the first three and the show stop there it is not worth it rent it if you have to see it it is not worth the time and the money,1183075200,,139,3.242424242424242
2593548,4,B000FZEQMI,"This is a great stand alone movie for those looking to get into a great anime and not spend a lot of money on the episodes when they are not sure they will like it or not.  For those who are long time fans it brings everything you have come to love about inu yasha: action, romance, and comedy.

In this particular film you discover more details about Inu Yasha's and Kikyo's ambiguous past relationship.  This info is not critical to the series but it gives you some interesting insight.  I say imbiguous because all you really know about the two is that they met, fell in love, and were tricked into detroying one another.  Here you get a bit more detail about their dynamics you wouldnt otherwise see in the show.

The majority of the movie takes place on the mysterious Horai island, home to half demons not unlike inu yasha.  This island home is meant to protect these hanyou (half demons) from humans and full blooded demons such as sesshomaru (not that he would dirty himself with them anyways).  Usually the island is hidden by a thick and dense fog, but every 50 years or so the islad reveals itself to the outside world.  It is then the Inu Yasha and friends meet a young demon girl who somehow knows inu yashan and needs his help.  Also a mysterous blazen scar appears in Inu Yasha's back!  He has no choice then to travel to the island to help not only the young hanyou, but himself as well.

That's a rather short plot i know but the movie also includes a side story with Sesshomaru and Rin.  Characters who do not make an appearance this time around include Naraku, Kohaku, Kagura, Kanna, and Koga.  (maybe it's an ""K"" thing?).  But all your other favorites are there.  Just sit back watch and enjoy.  If you truly enjoy inu yasha, then you will truly enjoy this film.",1180310400,,1782,4.41717791411043
2593549,3,B000FZEQMI,"The animation is amazing.  But the plot is pretty standard, especially in the Inu Yasha universe.  I have grown tired of the writers using Kikyo or Kagome or their image to threaten Inu Yasha and force him to relive his most traumatic moment.  The fights drag on for too long. And the whole movie just seems like spectacular excuse to give the fans more action, but no character development.  The weakness of the series is the same weakness of this movie.",1178323200,,455,4.580246913580247
2593550,4,B000FZEQMI,"Fire on the Mystic Island is like the filler episode of the movie series. It's fun, it's pretty, it's got some great fights and some good dialogue and character interaction, but you don't really learn anything about the characters or the world of the series that you didn't already know. While I was watching it, I didn't get the feeling at any point that I was watching a movie. It felt just like a really long episode of the anime. If all that is what you're looking for, then you're in luck. If not, you probably won't enjoy it as much as the other three movies.",1172707200,2,565,4.339622641509434

2593563,4,B000FZEQMI,"I have purchased the previous three InuYasha movies and find this one lacking in depth. While yes the anime series has ended a little too soon for viewers in America this movie seems a bit toned down, no intensity from any of the characters, no conflict between Sesshomaru and InuYasha, and no meeting between Kikyo and Kagome in what is otherwise an alright movie. Perhaps the producers and author of the series were trying to appeal to a larger audience and this version of InuYasha is lacking in passion, intensity, and connectedness to the main story in that InuYasha's time on Horai Island is never really explored in any kind of real depth. Now that I've torn this movie down I will say that if you don't care about any of the theme's I've mentioned then this movie is just fine.",1167782400,,785,4.574468085106383

After watching the last episode though, I had to see more...so i did view this in Japanese with English subtitles, and it's just like looking at the English dubbed versions. There's no Kagura, but you see a little bit more into Inuyasha's personality.

2593585,3,B000FZEQMI,"I've been a big fan of InuYasha for several years now, and own quite a few of the manga as well as most of the animated series out on dvd.  While I did think that the animation in the fourth movie was better than the first three, I was disappointed in the story itself.  I thought it was just kind of filler, to say 'hey look, we made another movie.'",1162512000,,350,3.9857142857142858
2593586,5,B000FZEQMI,"I was very Impressed with the movie, Great action, What do you expect it's Inuyasha, and the animation was great.",1162512000,,113,4.7
2593587,4,B000FZEQMI,"This movie most definitely does not fall under the typical Inuyasha movies that one has encountered so far.  This plot line ties in all stories including Sesshomaru's to this Mystic Island.  The plot line is very detailed and concise, must be an avid Inuyasha fan to fully follow the movie.

But like all the Inuyasha cliches' this still has the typical doomsday plot with out hero Inuyasha not only saving human-kind and the world, but a few more half-demons along with them.  Great movie, excellent soundtrack and orchestration with the same old loveable characters!

A must see for any Inuyasha fan!",1162425600,,602,4.920792079207921

2593589,5,B000FZEQMI,"I love this movie as much as the others, maybe a little more because it does show more hanyous and the isn't so much inu/kag in it. I REALLY hate Kagome. The only thing I don't care for was there wasn't alot os Sesshomaru in it. But overall worth the money!",1156464000,,257,4.0588235294117645
2593610,4,B000FZEQMI,"After reading several negative comments from Inuyasha fans, I had no expectations when I bought this movie. It turned out better than I had expected. The critism of some fans are founded, they don't know what Sesshomaru was doing on the island, since he is not a half demon, they don't understand how he got the marks. The background music is exceptionally good for movie 4. I found the art work equal in quality to the tv series and the other 3 movies although I found some camera angles of Inuyasha funny. Inuyasha's  language is not as vulgar as in the last half of the tv series. I prefer to watch this is Japanese dialogue with English subtitles although the English voice overs were excellent.

Some fans have criticised this movie as being aimless, an indication that the producers are running out of ideas but I disagree with that. It's a good story, like the others.

I bought the region 1 DVD from a large retail store and it was faulty. For the first 15 minutes, parts of the audio and video repeated itself. I exchanged it for another disk and the same problem persists. I'm still trying to get an error free disk. I'm not sure if anyone else experienced the same disk error with this movie. I am now wary of collecting the other 3 movies in code 1 fearing similar disk errors.",1155427200,4,1289,4.476595744680851
2593611,4,B000FZEQMI,"It is worth purchasing the DVD if you are a die-hard Inuyasha fan, but if you are expecting to see cool extras, beware.  The extra 'special footage' that were available in the previous Inuyasha movies were fantastic, but you can the creators were starting to run out of ideas in this latest DVD when they showed picks from director, staff and cast - it was sooooo lame!  I couldn't believe it!

But movie wise, I am glad this movie used the drawing style of the tv anime, it's so much nicer looking.

Rumors are abound about a 5th Inuyasha movie - hopefully this one will satisfy the fans that are wanting to see a conclusion of the character's relationships.",1155254400,2,659,4.512605042016807
2593612,5,B000FZEQMI,"I just purchased Inuyasha the Movie 4: Fire on the Mystic Island and I must admit that it was pretty good.  I love Inuyasha and this movie had all the elements that make Inuyasha great.  It has a solid story, powerful foes, and the classic bonds between Inuyasha and his friends which makes them work so well together.

Specifically, this movie focuses on Inuyasha, Kikyo, and yes, even a little bit on Sesshomaru's pasts.  Inuyasha and the crew come across a half demon girl from Inuyasha's past and save her from a powerful enemy.  Soon the gang is pulled into an epic battle on a mystic island with 4 powerful war gods.  This movie has good battles and I really enjoyed Inuyasha using the Adamant Barrage for the first time since he used it in the show.

I recommend this movie to any fan of Inuyasha, but suggest you buy the third movie before this one, it was much better.  My favorite scenes in this movie have to be Sesshomaru's battles.  A flaw in this movie is that not only Sesshomaru's, though his specifically, but  all the character's fights are too short. The only other complaint I had was the lack of Naraku.  He did not make one appearance in this movie and he's my second favorite character! Still, I love this show and this movie kept me interested until it was over.  I believe any fan of Inuyasha will enjoy this movie.",1154563200,7,1340,4.469135802469136
2593613,5,B000FZEQMI,"Honestly; I'm very disappointed after reading a few negative reviews.  Though everyone IS entitled to their opinion; I'm very surprised in what I read cause the movie DEFINITELY wasn't a disappointment.

When InuYasha Movie 4; Fire on the Mystic Island finally arrived...  I have to say; It was DEFINITELY WORTH IT!!!  THIS IS THE BEST INUYASHA TO DATE!!!  I really wish they'd done the other Movies in the same manor and style as they did here (even though I loved them all they still had something missing).  They definitely out did themselves in this movie!!  And I am very much impressed that even with 6 Season worth of TV Series and 4 Movies they never once lost that spark that most TV Series and Sequels harbor.  Even if you're not an Inu fan...  You'll love this movie and leave even more intrigued.  Not only did they turn towards the original art as the TV series, but they brought in a WHOLE knew style that just takes you to a whole new level of awesome.  Not a single thing was under or over done, and was just perfect.  I seriously hope that they don't mean to leave us in suspense with the TV Series, and that what they mean at the end of the movie isn't true (if you wanna know what I'm talking about; you'll just have to watch.).",1154476800,,1247,4.397379912663755
2593614,5,B000FZEQMI,"When I found out that Inuyasha was coming out I thought: its just going to be like the other ones, kagome gets captured and Inuyasha saves her...yada yada yada...but to my surprise it was really good and not the same as the first 3 movies. So yah go ahead and run to store and buy the movie. You will enjoy!",1154390400,2,307,4.133333333333334
2593615,3,B000FZEQMI,"I watched this in Japanese about six months ago. I wish there had been more development of Inuyasha and Kagome's relationship. It seems they become closer (don't want to spoil it) in the 2nd movie, then never mention it or hint at it ever again..in the remaining movies or the series. Then again, I'm a girl and feed off of that type of stuff. But, as a devoted Inuyasha fan, I was kind of let down. I hope they make another one.",1153526400,8,429,4.2439024390243905
2593616,4,B000FZEQMI,"Yep, I'm a die-hard ""InuYasha"" fan. I liked ""Guren no Hourijima"" (a/k/a Fire on the Mystic Island) for the same reasons some reviewers took exception to the film!  I originally purchased this film last year as an R2 in the original Japanese.  And, where I enjoyed the three previous InuYasha films, the 4th film is my favorite because it's the most purely entertaining of the quartet.

So should you buy this DVD?  I say yes for these reasons:

1) It has a clean, elegant plot-line.  On the surface, ""InuYasha:FOTMI"" might be an expansion of the ""Monster of the Week"" premise, however, the real message is driven home by a strong emphasis on family and friends.  A mix of appealing characters, stong moral conviction, and selflessness, creates a family-friendly anime experience.  If you have kids, this film will open up some great discussions.

 For tried and true fans of the ""InuYasha"" series, ""FOTMI"" provides a nice break from the Shikon scavenger hunt.  No Naraku, no exhusting plot twists to drive you crazy -- just straight forward action and great reparte between beloved characters.  Don't fret, there's some nice heart-tugging moments sure to please us old-schoolers!

2) This is one anime franchise children and parents can watch together and enjoy equally.  The action is exciting, well choreographed and discrete; characters are well developed.

3) No sexually objectionable or explicit content.  Some of the dialog contains 'rough' language (and probably will, too, in the English dub).  However I've heard FAR worse on network TV and famous cable music and comedy channels during prime time!

4) Technically, I appreciated Kyoto Studio's return to model for the character designs.  Unlike the previous three wonderful films, the character designs for ""InuYasha:FOTMI"" were taken from the television series models.

""InuYasha: FOTMI"" is a particularly beautiful anime, with an emphasis on lush, vivid backgrounds as a setting for the action.  The animators created a magical feast for the eye.  The visuals meet, and frequently exceed, Miyazaki standards in this film. The frame count is robust -- no cheating! -- and the CG is minimal, used only to enhance the animation, not overwhelm.

5) If a visual banquet and heart-touching story isn't enough,  add Karou Wada's dynamic musical score.  Wada-san is the John-Williams of anime music.  Besides ""InuYasha"", his portfolio includes music for the hit series ""Samauri 7"", as well as many, many other series. Wada-san's score is excellent and fits the characters and action perfectly.  Other musical suprises include the EP ""Rakuen"", which topped the Nihon top 40 after the film's theatrical release in December 04.

I'm enjoyed this wonderful series and enthusiastically collect every new N.A. release. I hope this review encourages new viewers to check out ""InuYasha: FOTMI"" on DVD: I also hope it convinces other anime fans to pick up a copy, too!",1152489600,57,2914,5.168803418803419
2593617,5,B000FZEQMI,"50 years ago a magical island known as Horal existed where demons and humans live in peace (which I fine hard to believe). Demons from the outside world broke the peace and left the island shattered.

Now the island has reappeared after 50 years and draws Inuyasha, Sesshomaru and Kikyo into its midst. The two dog brothers have strange marks on their backs. They both return to the island to discover it's secret.

In this movie you get to see children who also have strange marks on their backs. How do they have to get the marks off htye have to destroy the five bosses.",1151020800,9,573,4.447619047619048
