7930804,4,B0000541TQ,"This set's paced pretty well--we learn just enough of Nanako's secret on each of the 3 volumes that it doesn't spoil it. We learn Nanako is Dr. Kyoji's obsession so he's not the heartless evil jerk tormenting her one might believe from the first dvd. He actually goes through a lot to keep his promise to Nanako.  The violence could be an issue for some, but then this is rated 16+. There are secret plots involving the Vatican so some religious toes could get stepped on.  Kyoji's cool & funny as well as devoted & Nanako is the air-headed chick squealing every few minutes, but we get to see her redeeming side a bit more in this dvd. None of the rest of the cast ever really get fleshed out, but we only really need Kyoji & Nanako & the ending is left open for another show if anyone wanted to make it, although it wouldn't be necessary--we know her secret & how the Dr. feels so the story's been told. It's a major jiggle-fest, but sweet & worth it unless such fan service bothers one.",1044144000,5,989,4.311827956989247
