7752027,1,B01FWPDIA6,"Fortunately (or unfortunately)  this was free on Prime, so the only thing wasted was the time I'll never get back.  Terrible acting and comical special effects even for a low budget B movie.  Don't waste your time.",1509321600,2,214,4.72972972972973
7752028,1,B01FWPDIA6,"Bad acting, cheap special effects - low, low budget film. Could not get past the first 10 minutes. Do not waste you time.",1508976000,,121,4.304347826086956
7752029,1,B01FWPDIA6,I wasted my money. Glad I only rented it. Low quality. Sound was too distracting to watch more than five minutes.,1508716800,,113,4.428571428571429
7752030,1,B01FWPDIA6,"This is some really, really BAD acting.  I don't know what's worse, the acting, the screenplay or the special effects.  If you want to be tortured then watch this ""C"" list movie and you decide.",1508630400,2,193,4.485714285714286
7752031,1,B01FWPDIA6,"This was like a junior high or high school play that somebody happened to tape on VHS. I love movies as an art form.  I can find something entertaining in just about every movie i see.  I don't know what Amazon's criteria is for classifying something as a movie these days, but this was just awful in every way.  Dialogue, acting, special effects attempts, make-up, sound, score, actors trying to act gay, etc. I guess making it somewhat gay-ish and putting a few muscled guys was an attempt to fit in that genre. It's so bad it's almost comical.",1508284800,5,546,4.494949494949495

7752033,3,B01FWPDIA6,"It wasn't impressive.  The special effects were bad, the acting was ok, and the sound was horrible.  I don't know what happened to the sound engineer, but I'd think that could have easily been fixed in editing or post-production before this movie was released.  All-in-all, for a low budget B movie, I'll give the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars.  For those with gay issues, take heed this is a movie about a gay vampire couple saving the world.",1507507200,,447,4.55
7752034,1,B01FWPDIA6,"Terrible X 3.  Very low budget production, Bad Story... Horrible Acting.

7752036,1,B01FWPDIA6,"Don't be fooled by the stars, i watched the whole thing and i wish i could get the time back. The story was solid but as with most movies like this the execution was way off base. There is no investment in the characters, so i did not feel like i cared if one side or the other won and the sound, oh the poor poor sound. I understand using a band you know to do the music for your movie but the sound quality did them no justice. I won't get into the acting as i am sure i have never heard of anyone in this thing you call a film.",1507161600,4,530,3.7410714285714284

7752038,1,B01FWPDIA6,"Started the movie and went to let the dog into the house.  When I returned... they were gay vampires.  I didn't watch the movie; but, it would have been nice to have some idea about the vampires' orientation.",1506729600,4,208,4.447368421052632

7752043,1,B01FWPDIA6,"I couldn't even get through the trailer without feeling embarrassed for these actors. I don't know what Amazon is thinking with the stink pile of digital content they have been offering up as their wares. I confess I have grumbled about their small inventory of streaming goods in the past but the last two movies I had the misfortune to waste my time on made me long for the times when Amazon had less to offer and I only streamed from here as a last resort. I get teased with all this new content only to be let down when a movies like this one is what's on the menu. No thank you. I could tell from the small bit I could bare that the director needed to examine his career choice. The budget looked lower than the rent in a trailer park but I have seen better movies with less .Sorry Amazon, I can no longer pay for the privilege of consuming this stuff you offer up, like this boxed macaroni and cheese of movies. I think I will eat some where else.",1506297600,,953,4.184782608695652

7752048,2,B01FWPDIA6,"Honestly, for a B-rate flick, it's pretty good.  Vampires looked good...  Fight scenes were actually filmed stylishly...  Special effects, considering I'm guessing low budget, were better than expected...  and, the plot was good too...

That said, the audio was ATROCIOUS.  It would go from absolute mumbling / totally unintelligible, to peaking the audio tracks and being crazy distorted.  I'm only a novice when it comes to audio engineer work, but I can lay down tracks better than this in seconds... They really need to run the audio through some compression / normalization...  I ended up watching the movie with practically no volume and just turned on subtitles...  it's the only way I could do it, unless I wanted to keep switching my receiver volume from 10 to 70 every 30 seconds...",1503705600,2,792,4.984732824427481

7752056,5,B01FWPDIA6,"excellent movie, don't expect Star Wars special effects they only had a twenty thousand dollar budget to work with and this was originally a British mini series on TV. But, the storyline is great, the guys are hot and gay. The main characters are the good guys. How often do you see vampires that are the good guys? And it's a love story. This is a great follow up to Vampires Brighter in Darkness which you must see first or this won't make any sense.",1475884800,3,452,4.329411764705882
7752057,2,B01FWPDIA6,"Stop right now!!!! What a horror of a movie and that is not in the good way. The first of these Vampire movies was good bad fun, this is just bad. The woman who plays Lilith must be someones girl friend. She is the absolute worst all she does is snarl and growl and act very badly. And each time she does one of the above she opens her eyes very wide, it is creepy and not in a good way. Also another bad actress is the one who plays Hecate. Don't get me wrong, everyone acts very poorly but those 2 stand out in this movie as the ""please God never let them work again"" category. Terrible story, so much stupid snarling, bad dialog and very extended boring scenes where they just stand around or stare at each other. Heed my warning, don't do it.",1475712000,,746,4.116438356164384

7752059,5,B01FWPDIA6,I enjoy the movie pretty good as first one. I certain do hope they will plans on make third one to this movie.,1475107200,,110,3.8260869565217392

7752063,5,B01FWPDIA6,Love it could have been better,1472947200,,30,4.166666666666667
7752064,5,B01FWPDIA6,You have to appreciate this film for what it is.  A film with zero budget but loads of determination.  This is a very talented director that did incredibly well with what he had.  The special effects reminded me of True Blood at some times.  This isn't a 100 million dollar movie. Pretend that you are watching a 1970's or 1980's film and enjoy it.  The directors work reminded me of some of the low budget work Peter Jackson did before he went on to do Lord of the Rings.  It was campy fun and I'd watch it again.,1472860800,2,514,4.1938775510204085

7752066,1,B01FWPDIA6,"Vampire Lucas (Rhys Howells) searches the netherworld for his lover Toby (Dan Briggs). Toby's sister Charlotte (Rebecca Eastwood) is a witch and together they battle the straight vampires lead by Lilith (Abigail Law-Briggs) at the Eden school with her side-kick Eve (Kit Diamond). Lilith plans on taking over the world by using the blood of Toby to make a hybrid super vampire because immortality and traveling at fast speeds isn't enough. Our good guys seek the wisdom of Hecate, also Lilith's sister (Julie Pickering) for help.

This acting was laughable as were the lines and the plot. Some of the film was in black and white and at one time they used CG blood. Demonic voice enhancers are always cheap and bad. Make-up wasn't bad, but the snarling made me laugh. I have seen better acting at high school plays and this film might be considered ""so bad it is good"" to some.

I did laugh when mom, whose son was turned into a vampire, went to the after-world has a daughter for a witch and now faces extinction at the hands of Lilith says,... ""These things happen."" Well, no actually the don't. But it was a funny line. Confusing plot. No introduction of characters (assumes you have seen the first obscure feature.)

7752067,5,B01FWPDIA6,I absolutely lobed this follow up to the first vampires movie. The second one focusing on lucas trying to get his love toby back and lilith is back to her tricks again and the ending leaves it open for a 3rd movie. Would definitely recommend this movie 10/10,1470787200,4,258,4.395833333333333

8761676,4,B01FWPDIA6,"Mr. Howells,

As a film directory, I give your film 4 stars. I understand that this was a low budget movie and it could've been filmed better as far as the Cinematography goes,  but the story was still good and kept me intrigued. I wanted to know more about the characters on both seasons.  I think this story has potential.  If you get a bigger budget, you should consider filming this again and getting a good Director of Photography, better graphics and professional actors.  I think everyone did their best, especially yourself as Lucas! you played your role beautifully!",1513814400,,575,4.767676767676767

8761679,1,B01FWPDIA6,"The movie was so bad that it's laughable. I understand that this is a low-budget film but this was so bad that they'd have been better off never creating this travesty. Also, at the very least, they should have chilled out on the 80s special effects, it just made it worse. I like the concept, if done right this could have been an awesome movie.",1512000000,,346,4.338461538461538
