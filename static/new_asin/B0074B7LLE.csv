8657468,1,B0074B7LLE,"I got this as a xmas gift from my hubby but have to say it was a disappointment.  Its only 20 minutes, produced for fit tv, and not worth the price of 19.95.  I wish I had looked more carefully at what is available.  There are better videos that are twice as long or more for the same price or much less.  This was not a good value.",1358812800,,332,3.838235294117647
