I was hoping for behind the scenes for this ufc event, because ufc 155 did't have it. but the fights were good anyways there was 1 out of 5 fights one was a finish (main card) and 4 out of 6 were finishes (preliminary card) so in total there were 5 out of 11 fights were finishes. I've seen worse. and the last three fights of the main card were great.",1366416000,,874,4.756756756756757
8567814,3,B00BFOQJ8C,"This was the first official pay-per-view for the UFC of 2013.  Given the rocky year that the UFC went through in 2012 they set up a big pay-per-view to start off the year with.  Interestingly, given the biggest fight of the night was a title shot but two of the other big fights also had title implications.  So, a very important night in planning the months' coming events.

Joseph Benavidez and Ian McCall are both fresh off the tournament to crown the first Flyweight Champion in UFC history.  If you've been following, you should know that Demetrious Johnson won that tournament and then successfully defended said title last month.  So, both fighters were looking to use a victory in order to get a title shot at a man they had both fought in the past year.  Both fighters are wrestlers with decent striking but the main difference lies in Benavidez's power, a factor which most people thought would have played a part in his title losing effort against Johnson.  Now, given the 125 weight class most fights at this level tend to go to decision and are more about points than finishes.  But don't confuse that with a lack of excitement as the fighters at this weight division move so much fast than you're probably accustomed to.  As originally guessed this fight goes to the judges decision but I for one was pleasantly surprised at how strong both fighters looked in this fight.  Although each fighter's performance may not be awe inspiring I think it should be noted that these guys cancelled each other out as opposed to a straight boring fight.

Next up was a fight with a lot of interesting points going on.  Jon Fitch has a been a perennial top contender ever since he first challenged GSP for the Welterweight title back in 2008.  He's one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world and known for grinding out decisions with scary efficiency.  Now, this doesn't always make for the most exciting fight but there's not denying Fitch's talent as he has done this to top talent for years.  His opponent, Demian Maia, on the other hand is known more for being a Jiu-Jitsu fighter, with an evolving standup game.  As a multiple time world champion he is known for being absolutely devastating on the ground and it goes to show if you watch his early fights in the UFC where he's submitting people left and right.  Since then he's dropped a weight class and has since been undefeated.  Coming into this match it was revealed that Fitch held the best submission defense in UFC history, successfully guarding or escaping every submission he has ever been put in.  So, as a fan of good ground fights I kinda wanted to see how Fitch would handle someone on the level of Maia.  The fight I got was something of a double-edged sword.  There was a crap ton of technical prowess on display but as many fans will note it made for one heck of a grinding match.  Both fighters were going at a heavy pace and it may be hard to see if you don't know what's going on but it was a heck of a ground fight, if only predominantly one-sided.  The winner certainly makes a heck of an impression.

This is the second fight of the night with some interesting title implications.  Rashed Evans hasn't fought since he was defeated in his title losing effort against Jon Jones last April.  He has had a lot of time to decide where his career will go from there since and he's gone on to say that he wants a rematch against Jones.  Strangely enough, UFC management has some other idea of Evans.  Following the fallout of the Bisping/Belfort fight (If you don't know what happens, look it up and watch) Anderson Silva has been left without a clear contender for his title (Chris Weidman has been injured, and it sucks he can't fight sooner) so it was dependent on his performance on this night that he may get a title shot at ""The Spider"".  Unfortunately for Evans, Antnio Rogrio Nogueira stand in his way.  ""Lil' Nog"" was the national boxing champion of Brazil at one point and he's a Nogueira, so his Jiu-Jitsu is on a stupidly high level, so he was a legitimate threat on not only thwarting Evans's plans for a title shot but in getting a victory at all.  Given the importance of this fight I expected a much faster pace and I got what felt largely like a sparring match. There's just a lack of activity and what this boils down to is just straight out points, and not in the fun way where everything is lost in a maze of strikes and transitions.  Not a real fun match to watch, just simple as that.

In the co-main event, Alistair Overeem makes his return to the Octogan since defeating Brock Lesnar in his debut two Decembers ago.  Now, he was guaranteed a title shot after that victory until he tested positive for banned substances.  Most hardcore fans already know this since plans had to be changed up real fast with the results having been released little over a month before the actual pay-per-view. So he was unable to renew his license for over a full year and couldn't legally fight in that time.  In that time the Heavyweight division has changed quite a bit, which is a backwards step for thought but you should know what I mean, so Overeem has to earn his title shot again.  Interestingly enough, the man to last fight against current champion Cain Velasquez, before his title winning fight, was Antonio ""Big Foot"" Silva.  Given how well that fight went it's hard for people to understand just how dangerous he is since Velasquez made the fight largely a one-sided blood bath.  Look at his Strikeforce resume and look at the people he has beat or fought against and you'll come to understand real quick he's a legitimate threat in the UFC.  So, when Overeem started the talk of being flat out ""better"" I felt like Silva had a lot on his side in terms of motivation to go out and shut up the ""The Reem"".  Now, the fight plays out kind of how a typical heavyweight fight goes: not the fastest pace but plenty of leather thrown. Beyond that though there is a clear winner for a majority of the fight.  Then, something miraculous happened, a turn around.  I was jumping, rolling around, and just plain freaking out.  To put it simply, I love comebacks and this was a great one.  Trust me, this is the one fight of the night you will want to check out.

Here's the main selling point of the main card, the superfight between Jose Aldo and Frankie Edgar.  How often do we as fans talk about superfights between the pound-for-pound entrees?  Well, frankly too much with as little reward as I can imagine as a fan of the UFC.  It's so easy to talk about these things, hypothesize and strategize but it just doesn't happen, almost ever.  That's why when the announcement came that Aldo and Edgar were going to fight it seemed too good to be true.  This fight was originally supposed to happen this past October but Aldo was injured so it was postponed.  Before that his last title defense was January last year where he knocked out Chad Mendez in devastating fashion.  Edgar's 2012 was not as lucky.  He lost his title after three successful defenses to Benson Henderson and then was unsuccessful in getting it back (Or was he...?).  So, left in limbo Edgar was asked again, ""Are you going to drop down in weight?"" and he responded with a confirmation when he stepped in for Erik Koch who was injured in training.  So, here it was, the superfight between the current Featherweight champion and the former Lightweight champion.  That alone is a selling point.  To me, this fight felt a lot like Edgar's last fight with Henderson.  It's close.  I feel like it's closer than many people expected but with Edgar, you just can't count him out and that makes for a title fight full of close rounds and points to be judged with a fine comb.  If you're like me it's a hard fight to watch because while the speed is there for the lower weight classes the pace just feels a bit off but that's a personal preference for me.  Again, if you want to watch it be prepared for a fight that's not exactly a barn burner that's gonna knock your socks off but more of a technical fight for points.  Just didn't seem to bill the hype for me personally.

Now, the miraculous comment I made in regards to the Overeem/Silva fight is made simply because I hard time getting into most of this pay-per-view.  The comeback is the highlight to an otherwise underwhelming UFC card.  I wasn't blown away on a significant level by most of the fights and found most of the card, both main and under, was just alright.  For that reason I can't recommend buying this DVD.",1361318400,2,8531,4.499675113710201
