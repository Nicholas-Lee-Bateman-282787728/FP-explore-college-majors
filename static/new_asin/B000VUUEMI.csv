A lot of information is packed into this DVD. Watch once, take notes. Watch a second time and try some of it out!",1420416000,,334,4.234375

8220142,5,B000VUUEMI,"I have been a massage therapist for a couple of years now and have taken a few of Michael Buck's classes and find them all just wonderful.  When I took Mr. Buck's class on ""Thai On The Table"", it helped me learn all the awesome therapeutic techniques that I can now offer to my clients.  By applying his techniques, it actually puts my clients at ease knowing that I am able to help them in their postural alignments, which in turn helps to alleviate pain, discomfort and stress.  Seeing my clients walk out happy has always been my goal.  Thank you so much, Michael Buck, for your amazing work.  You are an inspiration to us all.",1237248000,3,630,4.396551724137931
