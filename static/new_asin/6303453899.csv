646313,5,6303453899,"This is the first of two Reba songs that were turned into films. The film is stars Reba alongside David Carradine and also features Scandal's Scott Foley. The film tells the story of a middle aged mother who deals with the trials and tribulations of raising a family, working and going back to school. There are two different versions of the artwork but no bonus features are included on either version. The quality is good for a tape to DVD conversion and it still holds up 20 years later. A must-have for any Reba fan.",1431734400,,520,4.484210526315789

646370,5,6303453899,This movie is a must-see for anyone who loves Reba McEntire; the song has inspired so many to go back to college and fulfill their dreams!,1396915200,,138,4.346153846153846
646371,2,6303453899,"I think I will watch this movie again to be fair. I watched it in 1994 while I was still finishing up with getting my own college degree, as a woman who went back to school at about age 30, myself. This was before the days of ""online classes"" so it was more challenging then than it would be now, to work out scheduling details, and babysitters if your children are young.

I love love love the song. But the movie was lame. My own ""back to school"" story was far more dramatic, and I faced bigger challenges than the character in the movie. The biggest challenge that I recall from the movie, was her father dying. My mother died one day before my student teaching orientation, about the most important ""class"" of my entire program. But that was not my only challenge. I'd have to write my own  book or movie to tell the rest. I see others said you need Kleenex to watch this movie. A lot of movies make me cry but I don't think this one affected me that way,",1389225600,,959,4.206521739130435

646376,5,6303453899,"I love Reb McEntire, so I of course loved the product, It arrived quickly and works great too. Love It!",1357430400,,103,4.2
646460,5,6303453899,"I absolutely LOVED this movie! I highly recommend it. It's about Lily Marshall(Reba McEntire)and her struggles with juggling college,caring for her father,caring for her husband and kids and juggling her waitress job. I wasn't exactly BLOWN AWAY by Reba's acting,but I felt it was pretty decent. This is going on my ""Fave Movies""shelf forever",1338940800,,342,5.351851851851852
646461,1,6303453899,"I'm a fan of many other Reba McEntire movies, but this made-for-tv production doesn't do justice to her talents. Director David Jones didn't get the best out of veteran actors Keith Carradine, and Donald Moffat either. The characters appear staged and their reactions exaggerated. The storyline is very stereotypical and lacks depth. Actress Genia Michaela gives a surprisingly good performance even though her character is the typical good girl gone bad, who redeems herself in the end. The image quality of the DVD is very grainy and the audio has a slight hiss in the background.",1267488000,,582,5.072916666666667
646462,3,6303453899,After seeing the music video for the song Is There Life Out There? I was a little taken back and confused mostly because the characters were different. I did like the movie and also liked Reba's performance.,1255737600,,207,4.621621621621622
646463,5,6303453899,"Love the story line. This is a great family video with a lot of good lessons in it. The acting is okay, but to me the message of the video
overpowers everything. I highly recommend this.",1246838400,,186,4.194444444444445
646464,1,6303453899,"I agree with most of the others, Reba should have stopped at the video!  The video actually matched the lyrics of the song and the movie was just a statement that had NOTHING to do with the song.  Ok so No is No, what part of Is there Life Out There said No is No?  I don't remember that lyric!",1239148800,,294,3.8666666666666667
646465,1,6303453899,McEntire should have left well enough alone because the music video to this song was perfect.  Her acting in the movie is an embarrassment...maybe she had bad direction or something.  Who knows?,1235779200,,194,5.03125
646466,5,6303453899,"the subject of this movie is alot like the show REBA.....Reba McEntire seems a strong hearted woman who though she hasn't had it easy (not always at least), she takes what life throws at her and makes the best of it. She's a survivor.",1230940800,,234,4.340909090909091
646467,4,6303453899,"It's not an amazing movie (which is why it didn't rate 5 stars from me), but I do like the story and the performances.  Reba is just wonderful.  Definitely a must-see for any Reba fan.",1222905600,,184,4.228571428571429
646468,5,6303453899,I watched this movie in 1994 and always wanted to see it again... I loved it. It is so inspiring and life-like. Reba and Keith bring Brad' and Lili to life. It truly touches your heart... It proves that it is NEVER to late to chase your dreams... A must see for anyone.,1219881600,,269,4.09433962264151

646552,4,6303453899,"A real 'feel-good' film with the two central stars complimenting each other with sympathetic performances. Considering Reba is probably the greatest female country singer ever, she shows that acting comes naturally to her. Another string to her bow.",1195171200,,249,5.578947368421052
646553,5,6303453899,This movie has a great story line that'll keep you intrigued.  Definitely worth the buy.,1192665600,3,88,4.866666666666666

646558,5,6303453899,"This was such an excellent movie, that would NOT be the same without Reba McEntire, in my opinion, one of the best actresses out there.  Awesome storyline, awesome actors/actresses, 5 stars.",1161734400,6,190,5.129032258064516
646559,1,6303453899,Only die hard Reba fans will give this movie a five star rating.  If they are honest they will realize that she just doesn't have what it takes to be a thespian.  She overplays everything and its obvious she does NOT know how to deliver a line!!!!!  REBA CANNOT ACT!!!!!  Her tremendous ego thinks she can do everything but suffice it so say that she ruins a good story by her amateurish foray into the acting medium.  She needs to stick to singing.,1131062400,2,449,4.36144578313253
646560,1,6303453899,An intelligent script is done in by the overdone histrionics of Miss McEntire who it seems cannot act her way out of a paper bag.  Her performance is laughable.  It ruins a good story.,1129593600,3,184,4.382352941176471
646561,2,6303453899,"When she utters the line ""I feel so violated""...Reba is totally inept as an actress in this movie.  THe story is inspiring and uplifting but McEntire is no actress.  She is a complete and total failure which bogs the movie down.  Its a shame they couldn't have had a ""real"" actress play this part.  THe movie would have been wonderful and worthy of a five star rating.  The supporting cast is o.k. but when they play off McEntire they look inept.  SHe makes them look bad.  I'm sorry but acting is not McEntire's forte.",1129507200,5,519,4.457446808510638
646624,5,6303453899,"This is a GREAT adaptation of the riveting song and music video ""Is There Life Out There"" by Reba McEntire. Coincidentially, Reba stars in this movie alongside acting vet Keith Carridine.  The heartwearming stories deals with a housewife's dream of becoming a college graduate and her struggles along the way to acheiving it.  The movie will not leave a dry eye and I HIGHLY reccommend it!",1127779200,26,389,4.878787878787879
646625,5,6303453899,"This is an amazing movie!! And the first movie where Reba uses her own music. This has a great story to it and if you love her song Is There Life Out There, and I know everyone does, you will love this movie!

646627,4,6303453899,"With two super actors like Reba McEntire and Keith Carradine, there isn't much that can go wrong.
I saw this film in 94 on CBS and fell in love with it. It's a kind hearted story about a woman who gets a second chance at life and ways of living it. Lili Marshall ( McEntire ) has a brush with death ( cancer ) and decides to live her life to the fullest once she is out of the clear. She's been a housewife for years, doing all she could for her husband Brad ( Carradine ) and her two children. It doesn't help that her younger sister ( Belle ) is a pain in the butt. Lili also works long hours in a diner and she hardly finds time for herself. She decides to go back to school. School opens a sea of horizans for Lili. She takes to her classes well while being befriended by the handsome young teaching assistant Joshua ( Mitchell Anderson ) who is more than eager to help Lili with her schoolwork.  Lili's new life puts a strain on Brad and once her father dies she's at her wits' end. She ends up having to choose between her old life and school. She makes the brave choice of continuing school. She is determined to see it through no matter how Brad feels. Her life couldn't get any better until she's thrown into a frightening reality during a study date with Joshua. He has more than "" friendly "" feelings for Lili. When she rejects him he doesn't take no for an answer but luckily Lili gets away. Now being almost raped, she struggles ( again ) with the choice of returning to class and to Joshua's haunting behavior. She does and proves to everyone she can win in the end.
This is a delightful film. Reba takes you on a fantastic and sad journey. It is hard to be a woman with priorites, but Lili Marshall proves that life's hardships often lead to its rewards.",1079481600,22,1769,4.187683284457478
646628,5,6303453899,"First off I just want to say, that Reba did a killer job in this movie. Is There Life Out There, is a truly remarkable movie. It makes you wander what life would be like in the world, if you had not married and had kids. I loved this movie, it's the type of movie to laugh, cry, and just want to watch over and over again. their is no reason to dislike this movie. It's a life that alot of people deal with or even go through. The only thing i do dislike, is that they don't sell it in stores, you have to order it over the internet, which usually requires a credit card, that alot of people just don't have. So why not sell it in more stores.
  Because alot of people like tearjerkers and this movie is one of them. It needs to be sold more or at least let people get them with money order. But it's a credit card. please help me to let people sell them more. It's a movie you don't want to miss.",1023494400,6,897,3.923076923076923
