5878989,5,B00DYEBLYI,"The entire set is currently available for under 80$. Why haven't you purchased this? In total, it comes out significantly less than ordering them separately. As for the content, its the four first seasons of Digimon. This is the Golden Age of the Franchise, on one neat little box set. From Tamers' mores challenge, to Adventures with the original Digidestined, to actually becoming Digimon, this is the same show we all grew up watching, in great quality. It does not feature the Japanese Sub, but that may not necessarily be an issue.",1384732800,10,536,4.836956521739131
5878990,2,B00DYEBLYI,this kind of disappoints me. I had just gotten the final 4th season of digimon only 2 days ago and all this year I've been collecting the official season as they come out. if i had known this was to become available i would've preferred to wait rather than be led on not knowing this was going to be coming out.,1379462400,4,311,4.114754098360656
5878991,5,B00DYEBLYI,"I've LOVE Digimon since I was a young girl when it first came out years ago, with Tai, TK, Kari, and all the others and always try to catch any sequels they make when they come out. I'm glad that they are FINALLY bringing all the series onto DVD after over a decade. *lol* now if they would do it for series like the original Battle B-daman, Flint the Time Detective and a whole lot of other anime I would love to see again.

But I have a question. What about the Digimon movies and specials? At least the ones that have already been translated and dubbed into English that were aired on TV when Disney channel was still airing the Digimon series?",1377907200,6,647,4.260162601626016
5878992,5,B00DYEBLYI,"If you don't already own seasons 1 to 4 of Digimon in season or volume sets, then this humungous collector's set is for veteran Digi-fans everywhere who still don't have season or volume sets of it. Maybe someday, Cinedigm will have another deluxe set of the Data Squad and new Fusion sagas together! Only time will tell if I'm right. At any rate, all 205 unedited, more or less, American-print episodes of the first 4 seasons ""DNA-digivolved"", ""fusion evolved"", or have been ""Digi-fused"", into 1 unheard-of deluxe 32-disc DVD set never before available! From the tale of the first 8 pair of Digidestened and Digimon partners, to its be-awesome follow-up, to the story of the Tamers, to the Frontier gang's famous run, it's all in this ""fantastico"", unprecedented set, pluperfect (beyond perfect) for collectors at Christmastime or their birthdays, or both at once! But it'll be very high to get this set, just to warn everyone. But unfortunately, the theatrical & TV movies for each season won't be in this one either. But it does contain the booklets & photo galleries for each season set on their own, combined in this set! As Bokomon once said, ""my friends, we just witnessed the birth of a new... Digimon DVD deluxe set!"" He'd also say this on the matter; ""Oh, Neemon. They thought the unthinkable & accomplished the unimaginable!"" This is indeed the most ""prodigious"" collection of Digi-mania the Earth has ever heard of! So if you don't own the single season sets, even if you're a veteran Digi-fan like me, this set's a must-own, movies or no! No one, not even me, ever thought this set was even possible, by bootleggers OR as a real authorized set! Keep bringing it on, Cinedigm! Exciting, isn't it?",1374796800,47,1708,4.812925170068027

5878995,4,B00DYEBLYI,"Haven't watched the discs yet as they only just arrived today, but I did want to make a note on the cases. My cases arrived intact and at first glance in good condition, but as I took them out of the box to inspect for scratches or loose discs I did find that the cases for season one and season four do not stay shut on their own. Not a huge deal as I do plan on keeping the box, but for me it does keep the series from that perfect five star rating.

I'll update if I have any further issues with the set, but I do love that this set exists and that I'll be able to re-watch the series and the tri movies are coming out. Also, given the prices I've seen for the individual sets, I really do think this is a deal.",1495756800,3,714,3.857142857142857

5879016,5,B00DYEBLYI,"Digimon is one of my favorite shows from my childhood, even as a grown man I thoroughly enjoy it.

The DVDs and their content is high quality, and the cases that hold the discs are great. The booklets even have some good trivia about the characters, without spoiling the show's plot and events.

A great value for the price I got it at ($140 brand new), you would end up spending more buying the four seasons separately. This series is very entertaining and has great development amoung the characters and plot.

In summary, it is worth the money and entertaining for the family to watch.",1456963200,,588,4.580952380952381

5879020,5,B00DYEBLYI,"I loved this show growing up so I was thrilled to finally watch it again as an adult. Still good! I recieved the set on time and in good condition. The only issue I really had was that 2 of the 4 cases just wouldn't close. I'm not sure if this is a common issue? I read a few other reviews that stated there was a problem with the quality of the set. At first, I thought the cases were broken but it's more like there's just too much compacted into these cases (8 discs and thick booklet). They closed fine when I took out the booklets. I ended up switching the cases around with the ones that did close. This fixed the issue and now all 4 of the cases close fine. It's definitely worth buying if you're a huge fan of the show and don't currently own any of the sets already.",1434153600,,775,4.038961038961039

5879022,5,B00DYEBLYI,Finally all digital monsters seasons in one box set. The only issue I have is with the shipping. The outer box is damaged where it could had some better protection in the box such as bubble wrap etc. Apart from that everything is OK.,1433808000,,233,4.318181818181818
5879023,1,B00DYEBLYI,"I had the same Case issue as it appears others did, my set arrived and brand new factory sealed, all 4 dvd cases were damaged, i mean damaged as it looks like someone smashed them on the floor, disks all seem fine on quick inspection and run ok decent video quality, have a replacement being sent, returning the current one i have, (Pictures are mere minutes after i opened the box and took off plastic wrap) oh and the box my original set came in had NO packing material to hold it in place",1433203200,4,491,4.23404255319149
5879024,1,B00DYEBLYI,"I am highly disappointed in this. As a long-time fan of the show I was waiting for a good box-set to appear - THIS IS NOT IT!
I understand that the show was not originally designed for DVD, but the quality is beyond questionable. And outside of the episodes, the DVD menu is abhorrent! It is glitch-ridden, it stalls and essentially crashes on a whim, the ""Play All"" function stalls after the very first episode.

No effort went into the preparation for the episodes to be on DVD, none-whatsoever.

But let's talk about the case too! There are so many DVDs packed into each individual case that they will not close at all. The DVD's are clearly of low quality, the labels that are printed on are sub-par at best and make me wonder if someone didn't just print them in their home before shipping them out. The pack was likely so hastily packaged, with so little consideration for quality, that they managed to shove duplicate DVD's into the package as well...

So, to recap: I have a complete box-set of low-quality DVDs that crash on playback and look like they were originally recorded on a VCR and transferred a few times before making their way to DVD, the cases themselves cannot contain the pitifully captured episodes without excessive force, and I even have some spare DVDs just in case one or two turn out to be faulty...or something.

This was a complete waste, I really wish I would have played these immediately after I got them but I simply didn't have time until now. I would have returned these in a heartbeat and opted to make my own using episodes found online and DVDs I bought at the dollar-store - the quality simply could not be worse and I could not be less satisfied.

Truly, and profoundly unfortunate.",1428883200,2,1725,4.56957928802589

I had some problems wit it thoug. 1) I chose 3-4 shipping on the 3rd and it didn't get here until the 14th. 2) They had it forwarded to my local postal service and that is 15 miles away from my house. 3) When I finally opened the product season 1 case was some what broken. All in all pretty good no damage to the product it's self the only reason it got a 4 was such a long shipping time and season 1case being slightly broken.,1423958400,,489,3.9494949494949494

5879049,3,B00DYEBLYI,"If this were just a review of the shows, this item would get 5 stars. However, as I've been watching the DVDs, I've noticed that some of the episodes have poor audio or video quality.

For example, episode 31 of Frontier has muffled-sounding audio, and episode 10 of Adventure has blurry visual quality.

Combined with the much-maligned lack of language options, I'd say these DVD sets are really only worth buying because they're the only official Region 1 DVDs of full seasons of Digimon.",1396569600,10,490,4.821428571428571
5879050,3,B00DYEBLYI,"Got this because my old VHS tapes are getting worn out but I needed them to have either closed captioning or subtitled in English because I am deaf.

When I got this and checked them all, there is absolutely no subtitle anywhere at all!  Season 2-4 has closed captioning, which means some DVD player may not work, and only if you connected to TV via composite, S-Video, or 480i component.  720 and 1080 component  and HDMI do not support closed captioning at all.

Way to go whoever did the description, show how you discriminate against the deaf people by lying about the subtitle and make us waste time watching what amounts to us blank video.  This is the second time this year I was lied to about English subtitle on DVD sets. I'd fire whoever set the web description and get Amazon manually check every single DVD you sell new before making another false claim. This would be a lot cheaper than having Amazon pay to return all those opened DVD sets because of misleading description.

Dinged this one star because someone was being dumb and added English Subtitle to this for no reason, and another star because why have closed captioning on season 2-4 but not season 1???

The cases were decent and box were nice and should fit most DVD collection.",1396483200,24,1254,4.591928251121076
5879051,4,B00DYEBLYI,"Nostalgia! This complete collection of Digimon is a must for any Digimon fan or any person that grew watching it. The amount of episodes that are contained in this set is well worth the price of $79.99. The set came with 4 box sets in a large slip cover that holds all 4 seasons. Each disk contains a character from the series and a list of episodes on that certain disk. The product looks beautiful, but there are some cons to the product. Season 2 and 3 dvd cases will not close due to the amount of disks in the product, but the quality of the cases could have been better to prevent this. Two episodes in season 1 had visual problems must have been an error to the encryption onto the disc. It was still watchable but was cringing at the sight of it. Some collections contain a season 1 case with its separate slip cover which i was hoping for but did not get it. Overall this collection was great, beautiful, and brings back so many memories.

For an anime series dvd to not have the option for sub is almost a sin on its own.

It was closed when I got and now It won't close at all. Tho I keep all 4 of them in the big box thing at all times even when I'm watching a DVD from it. So overall I say this is a great value to have. Really hope that one day they will make one for season 5 and 6 whenever that comes out from a long time from now.,1395187200,,491,3.4324324324324325
5879064,5,B00DYEBLYI,The package came earlier then expected and that is always awesome.  All the disks I have watched have been great no problem.  My only issue and it is very small is that the description is too vague.  Yes they were in great condition but season one did not have it's pamphlet in the case. It wouldn't have prevented my purchase but would have been nice to have a better idea of the true used condition.  Other than that been happy with my purchase.

It even comes with a a nice poster (similar to the cover of the box set itself), which is a nice touch. However, the set totals 32 discs crammed into four different cases, one for each season; they're a bit flimsy, but adequate. The worst part is that the DVDs pretty much only contain the show, and nothing else. No special features is okay (though the last disc of each season contains a villain's gallery), but there's no subtitles or language options at all, not even English for the hard of hearing. I for one almost always used captions when watching something, so the omission of something that's more or less standard these days is pretty jarring.

I'm glad I picked this up when I did because the price seemed to go up on amazon. It was around 90 bucks when I bought it. And at Walmart it's over $200. I was originally going to buy them individually but it would have been way more expensive. This set contains the first four seasons of Digimon. Each individual set contains a booklet and photo galleries. The boxset itself contains a poster that has the four seasons DigiDestined kids and their digimon on it. This is an awesome set for anyone who grew up with the show or want to watch a great cartoon. Finally, I get another piece of my childhood to put in my DVD collection.",1392681600,,727,4.27536231884058
5879070,4,B00DYEBLYI,"So growing up I loved digimon and Im glad i bought this. Seasons 1-3 were the greatest part of my childhood. Season 4 was just terrible but oh well, the others make it better :)",1392249600,,177,4.085714285714285
5879071,5,B00DYEBLYI,I am a big Digimon fan and when I heard they released the first 4 seasons in a Box set I knew I had to have it. Hope Season 5 comes out soon,1391990400,,140,3.272727272727273
5879072,4,B00DYEBLYI,Great compilation of all the seasons. The only thing it lacks are the dubbed movies for each season. A great item for any fan,1391990400,,125,4.25
5879093,5,B00DYEBLYI,Theirs not much to say its freakin digimon!! Poster is amazing just like the seasons. the cases within the set are kinda cheap for the price you pay but hey its digimon so funk it,1391817600,,179,4.142857142857143
5879094,5,B00DYEBLYI,This show was an awesome part of my childhood that i will share with my kids these company's should make more hows from the 90's and sell them like zoids,1391385600,,153,4.133333333333334
5879095,4,B00DYEBLYI,"Having watch this growing up, it amazing how many disc are pack in this sucker! Worth the price of admission! Looks pretty crisp for DVD standards. Wish it was available on Bluray which is my only downer. Love the booklet that come with each season that previews new characters and Digimon. If you loved it before then you'll love it again!",1391299200,,340,4.590163934426229
5879096,5,B00DYEBLYI,"The first four seasons of this show are alot better than the one that came after then. I think that digimon fusion is doing okay, but these are the best seasons by far. I'm so happy that they can out with this boxset on dvd.",1391126400,,224,4.0
5879097,5,B00DYEBLYI,Best cartoon as child and I was excited to receive all the seasons. Parents and kids alike will enjoy watching from the beginning. I was finally able to catch up on all the story lines from each series because of this collection. I really wished season 5 was i included. Season 1&2 are a great. Season 2 should've had a second season to it because the ending was sad. Season 4 was good even though Digimon companions weren't even involved like the previous seasons. It would've been great to have all the movies included but just search them up on youtube.,1390953600,,556,4.514851485148514
5879098,5,B00DYEBLYI,"As it should be known, I have many fond memories of this great series. Digimon will always epitomize to me the perfect childhood show. It had a likeable cast, scenes of great adventure and heartwarming anecdotes. Though I am mainly a fan of season 1 and 2, I am more than glad to purchase season 3 and 4 as well it should be interesting to see how they worked with those seasons. To anyone who is trying to relive their love for the series definitely check out this DVD the show is pretty much exactly as you remember it.",1390694400,,521,4.2727272727272725
5879099,5,B00DYEBLYI,"Digimon was a very large part of my childhood, so once I saw this, I knew I had to get it. I had never seen any of season 4 though, and I hadn't watched Digimon at all for years. But I knew I'd still like it. AND BOY DO I LOVE IT!
This set is great! Sure, its just the separate seasons sets put together in a slipcase, but its a good deal and I even love the slipcase. Every season is total nostalgia, but I'm finding that I still get sucked into the show. The story, the characters, the setting. It's just too great. This set is sure to go over well with any Digimon fan.",1390003200,,572,3.8974358974358974
5879100,5,B00DYEBLYI,The tapes were a big hit with my grandson. He told me the tapes were one of the best gifts he received. They arrived on time and it good condition,1389830400,,146,3.9
5879101,5,B00DYEBLYI,"I purchased this set when it was only eighty bucks and absolutely love it! This is quite a hefty set; you get a total of 32 DVDs containing all 205 episodes of Digimon Adventure, Digimon Adventure 02, Digimon Tamers, and Digimon Frontier plus a poster that depicts the same image as the one on the front of the box-set. The set itself contains all four seasons which come in their individual cases as well as a booklet for each season containing information on the main characters and digimon which come in the slipcase pictured. The video quality of the DVDs is fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised by how clean and vibrant the animation looked when played on my little flat-screen. I loved all four of the seasons in this set when I was in grade-school and it is great to be able to watch them all again whenever I'm struck by a fit of nostalgia! The only thing that would have made this boxset better would have been the inclusion of the movies for each season, but sadly those were not included. I would highly recommend purchasing this set instead of the individual seasons as (at the time of this review) buying only two seasons cost the same as this box-set!",1388707200,,1169,4.518867924528302
5879102,5,B00DYEBLYI,"Grew up watching this show, and have been dying to own the individual seasons on DVD. Could not believe the set included the first four seasons for this price! The packaging is beautiful, and the quality of the sound/video is amazing. Don't miss out on this nostalgic treasure!",1388448000,,277,4.791666666666667
5879123,5,B00DYEBLYI,For those who grew up in the 90s this is a great Nostalgic blast. Recommended to anyone who was a fan.,1388448000,,102,3.9047619047619047
5879124,4,B00DYEBLYI,"The seasons are all split into their own individual cases, so when I opened the wrapping from the main box, I was surprised to find out that only two of the cases were individually wrapped inside it. While it was listed as new, this tells me that it was probably used and rewrapped. One of the seasons that was wrapped had some minor scratches on the discs, but they didn't seem to be an issue. Other than the possibility of getting a rewrapped, used item, this is a must have for anyone who loves Digimon.",1388188800,,506,4.336842105263158
5879125,5,B00DYEBLYI,"Must buy if you're a digimon fan. Getting this collection is more worth it than getting them separately, plus its at a $80 price tag which make this collection a steal.",1387670400,,168,4.451612903225806
5879126,5,B00DYEBLYI,"Got this for my little bro, and he has been avidly watching it since. Season 3 was especially engaging, even for me, watching here and there.",1387497600,,141,4.461538461538462
5879127,5,B00DYEBLYI,Great price for the quantity. The only possible downside is (as indicated in the product description) no Japanese language track.,1387497600,,129,5.5
5879128,1,B00DYEBLYI,"I was disappointed when I opened it up and checked through the discs. While the discs looked fine, the cases where you open them at, were all busted. It probably isn't a big deal to some, but I'm OCD so it bugs me greatly.

I can't close the cases because of that either, and it's busted where the cases are actually coming apart. This was a pricey item, and kind of a collection thing, so I am definitely not satisfied with the product.

Otherwise, it shipped fast and was fine. Not worth the price with the busted cases though.

But I'm definitely not a satisfied customer.",1387411200,,575,4.40566037735849
5879129,5,B00DYEBLYI,"One day, I was reminiscing and being nostalgic. I was browsing for old TV shows, and immediately thought of Digimon. At that time, only season 1 had been released, but it was still comparatively at least $3 cheaper than some other sites I looked at. I snapped it up. Fast-forward a year later, I was trolling again. This time, I was waiting to have the money to buy more box sets. I saw this set, and my jaw just about dropped. I immediately thought it was too good to be true, because how could a set of seasons 1-4 be only $80?! I thought it was a scam, but I read some reviews and compared it to the other set I bought and noticed it was the same group that sold it. Decided to compare other sites before buying, and this was by far the cheapest I found. Walmart.com had it for $206. I snapped it up, right away. Glad I bought it when I did, seeing as it's up to $184 now.

Only thing I bad I can say is that it was left out in the cold in Wisconsin, but that's more the UPS/Fedex than Amazon. Checked all the discs as soon as I could, and they all work like gems.

If you're an adult that grew up in the 90's and just want this for nostalgia, or to show your children, or just because you're an avid collector: THIS IS A GREAT BUY! Buy it now, before it goes up in price again.",1386892800,8,1281,4.0
5879130,5,B00DYEBLYI,"This thing rules! My childhood anime in one boxset that i slammed for 80 bucks! Getting each season of the original digimon series for 20 dollars each is a steal.

One thing that it doesn't mention is that this thing comes with a poster and the case is like metallic and sexy.

Done! buy it!",1385510400,,291,4.2727272727272725
5879131,4,B00DYEBLYI,"Physically:
This is a very appealing collection. The box is a shiny blue on all sides; the product image shown is the front. The top, bottom, and display side all feature Tai and Agumon, as well as the Season 01-04 logos. The back gives all the summary information for the collection. There may be some corner-foxing or tears from the assembly of the collection.
Each season is in its own 8-disc case (four two-disc pages), with Season 1 also having its own mini-box. The cases themselves are medium-quality plastic - when I unsealed my collection I noticed a chip in the cases of both Season 3 and 4, and my Season 2 case does not close correctly (the locking tabs do not fully enter the clasps for whatever reason). There also may be some scraping/tearing of the thin clear display plastic from the assembly of the collection.
Each season also comes with its own booklet, but don't be disillusioned; it's exactly when the box says it is, a ""character guide"" booklet. It features the Digidestined and their Digimon (as well as any other story-important independent Digimon), and that's all - no episode guide or season summary. However, each disc has the episodes on it listed (some of them are spelled wrong, though).

Disc Play:
Right off the bat, this collection is of much better quality than the Alliance/Pioneer Entertainment versions. My television is 4:3, and I don't know what the default resolution of these episodes are, but the screen image is very clean (except for scene transitions coming from what would have been a commercial). The Digimon Analyser names are all in English (improved from the Alliance version), and the episode title text is in the original style. The collection is labelled as in Dolby Stereo and is very clean sound-wise.
For older kids who remember, during Digimon Adventure (Season 1), after the Eighth Child is revealed, there are new opening and credits sequences - this collection has them! Which is another advantage over the Alliance collection and YouTube.

Overall, I am very happy with this. I grew up with Seasons 1-3, and was looking to improve from my Alliance collection. This was released by the same studio doing the Yu-Gi-Oh! season releases, which are also vast improvements on their predecessors.
The only reason I took off a star is for the physical imperfections and episode title misspellings. If you like Digimon either from your own nostalgia or as something you want to introduce your own kids to, this is definitely a value buy.",1385251200,,2491,4.872641509433962
5879132,5,B00DYEBLYI,"First things first, it comes with a 20"" x 30"" poster (which I don't think was mentioned anywhere in the product description, it looks like the boxset cover). I could sit here and gush about how much I love Digimon and have since I saw the first episode air as a kid, but odds are if you're reading this review you're already a fan and really don't need me to tell you about that. Some of the DVD cases don't seem to want to stay closed on their own, but when they're all in the box that really doesn't matter. The Guide Booklets (one in each season) are mostly visuals with names, character descriptions very brief (and somewhat unneccesary, I know who everyone is, but still appreciated). (Also for some reason Kari is listed as 9 while TK is 7 in the season 1 booklet, even though in season 2 they're shown to be the same age.) The only special feature on each season is the gallery. In season 1 this gallery is of character sketches of the Digidestined and their Digimon partners and they're lovely. Season 2's gallery is just a digital villain version of the guide booklet. The galleries in seasons 3 & 4 are also just digital extended guide booklets. I wish there was more, but even having this is more than I would expect.

I thought I would never be able to afford this, but when it went down to $80 I was instantly sold and am thrilled to own it. (I still technically couldn't afford that price, but considering how much I was saving there was no way I wasn't going to let myself own it.)",1385078400,3,1496,4.3238434163701065
