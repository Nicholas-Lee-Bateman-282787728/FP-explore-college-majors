Again, I have been working in film, and special effects for years, and only recently ventured into creature creation. These videos have been a HUGE help. The author truly takes the time to explain everything. I get nothing in return for my comments here, I am honestly that impressed by these videos. Keep it up DTCreations! You have a customer for life.",1340409600,,491,4.52808988764045
8434258,3,B004LEVEE2,"In our first video we demonstrated the entire process of building a radio controlled mechanical mask. However, the eye mechanism created was extremely simple and only involved left/right eye movement and upper lid blink. Because the realism of an animatronic character depends greatly on the animation of the eyes, sometimes it's necessary to design something more complex which can imitate the natural eye and eyelid movement more effectively. The mechanism created in this video involves 2 axis eye rotation and blinking is achieved with the movement of both upper and lower eyelids. But the most interesting thing about this design is that the eyelids follow the eyes when they look up and down. The entire assembly only requires 3 servos. We will also take a look at AutoCAD 10 software to design our mechanics. Most of the parts created are not metal so no machining skills are required.
