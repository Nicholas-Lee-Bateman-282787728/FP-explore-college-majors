8513272,1,B007AFC0T2,"This is an inaccurate, rewritten version of US history. I looked at a sample for my 2nd grade students and was appalled at the lack of basic accuracy. Children need to be given the truth, which they can deal with. If given a steady diet of this program, children will learn later that they can't trust adults to tell the truth.",1481414400,3,327,4.377049180327869

8513275,4,B007AFC0T2,I would have given this a 5  but due to the low quality of the animation it only rates a 4 with me.  The videos have wonderful content.  We watch a video on Monday and fill in the question/answer sheets.  Then we re-watch it each day of the week and the kids do the worksheets as a quiz.  During the week we use the discussion questions informally.  It is amazing how much even my third grader learns from the videos even though he typically dislikes studying history at all!,1389052800,13,475,4.280898876404494
8513276,4,B007AFC0T2,"My father-in-law sent these videos to my children.  He is active politically and loves his country.  I put these on while I was eating my lunch and my children joined me.  The DVDs were engaging and kept my children's interest.  There is a rap-up at the end to summarize the facts of the DVD.  The animation was not Disney quality, but that wasn't a problem.  The third DVD ended with a cliffhanger and my children want to know what happens next.  I recommend these DVDs as an add-on education tool.",1375920000,22,499,4.477777777777778
