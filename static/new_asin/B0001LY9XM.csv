Definitley check it out!,1022112000,22,394,4.297297297297297
8014176,4,B0001LY9XM,This movie is a lot of fun. It was interesting to see Joe Lando of Sully fame from Doctor Quinn Medicine Woman play the part of Cinderella's husband.,1506988800,,149,4.357142857142857

8014178,5,B0001LY9XM,"it was a sweet love story, with no raunchy stuff.  Good for a grandma to watch with her young granddaughter.",1357516800,,108,4.4
8014179,4,B0001LY9XM,"I liked it not so much for the movie but because Joe Lando is in it. It shows his skills and talents as an actor, and that he can play anything.  It was very different from what he has usually done but he was very good in it. I would recommend this product to anyone, although it is more for children.",1357344000,,301,3.9344262295081966
8014180,1,B0001LY9XM,I got this movie because it sounded cute and had Joe Lando and Shirley Jones in it. What a major disappointment. It was like watching a taped version of a Jr. High play. Nothing against the actors; they did the best they could with what they were given. Didn't even hold my 9 year old niece's attention. I was very sorry that I made this purchase.,1337385600,,347,4.2727272727272725
8014181,3,B0001LY9XM,what we were able to watch of the movie without the closed captioning that Amazon and the back of the DVD case stated it had was okay but we didn't get to watch much due to this fact.,1315526400,,183,3.8421052631578947
8014182,2,B0001LY9XM,"It was a very good story but it was done as though it was done live on stage. They had very good actors.  I was very unhappy with the way the ""movie"" was done.",1304899200,,159,3.676470588235294
8014183,3,B0001LY9XM,"Ok I bought this DVD because I love Joe Lando and Shirley Jones.  Lando is charming as the besotted King Gregory, Cinderella's husband, and Shirley Jones is beguiling as the fairy godmother. If you can get through the first 20 minutes, you can get through to the end.  The younger actors are stereotype cardboard characters, the script leaves a lot to be desired and the music is just horrible.  And there is really no need for a bumbling fairy godbrother or an evil wedding warlock (don't ask.) Young girls and tweens will probably love to add this TV movie to their collection, but older girls should stick with Ever After (Drew Barrymore.) Watch for a cameo of Stan Lee as the priest who marries Cinderella and shouts his trademark ""excelsior""!",1168128000,3,747,4.730769230769231
8014184,4,B0001LY9XM,This movie is good for anyone who loves the story of Cinderella and prince Charming,1167782400,,83,4.6
8014185,3,B0001LY9XM,"I grew up as a huge fan of the Cinderella story, so I was alittle bit disappointed in this production until I found out it was a pilot for a children's television show. I honestly watched this movie for two reasons: Shirley Jones and Joe Lando. I thought Shirley was beautiful as the Fairy Godmother, but the whole idea of a ""Fairy Godbrother"" for Cinderella's daughter, Cindy was unbearable. As for Joe Lando as King Gregory, no one was better suited as the once ""Prince Charming"". This movie is really many snippets of so-called adventures with outrageously silly antics that might appeal to girls more than boys aged 7 and up. The premise is the same, except this time it is Cindy who has fallen for a ""commoner"". The romance between Cinderella and Gregory is still very sweet, which helped me sit through the entire movie. Although mostly corny jokes and antics fill this movie, the acting from most(Shirley Jones, Joe Lando, Roger Rose) was good and it is family oriented to fit the times of today.",1130284800,16,1003,4.672316384180791
