and for what ever reason you get through all those 20 tears of Abel dying and he reappears as this freaky blue naked thing, then is latter shown normal trapsing around the country-side with the Earl of Memphis. All I can think of is, well while you were at 100 percent nano machines what the heck were you doing letting him get AWAY?

rent it. don't let your hard earned cash get sucked into this.
and just think, I actually adore Trinity Blood. its just the ending of the anime that sucked big time.",1187654400,2,740,4.451851851851852

8171045,5,B000MR9D4K,"Abel Nightroad is a Cruznik. A vampire that feeds on the blood of other vampires. He is also a clergyman that fights to protect the humans. A organization is out to start a war between humanity and the nations that are ruled by the vampires. Abel and his friends must fight to protect humanity and the vampires from a war that could wipe out both races. Like it almost did 900 years ago.

This anime is beautifully done. The animation and voice acting are great. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. Like all the great animes this story has tons of great characters and very compelling story. There's nothing bad about it. I am shocked to see that there are people out there that didn't like this series. It's certainly different, but not one you'll soon forget.",1354752000,,760,4.547445255474453

8171052,4,B000MR9D4K,"First, not to overstate the obvious, but if you bought the starter box and the previous limited edition releases then obviously you should buy this just to complete your limited edition collection. We get to find out about Esther, Abel returns, we get to see  more great fight sequences, etc. And we get to see a very significant flashback sequence that explains a lot more about Cain and Abel. It's not a perfect ending (but then, neither was the series) but there are still lots of great and tearful scenes along the way.",1189728000,2,523,4.623655913978495
