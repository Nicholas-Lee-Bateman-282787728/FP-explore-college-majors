5047348,5,B0071CWXJG,"THE CINEMATOGRAPY WAS VERY GOOD...LOVE the food presentations!  The acting was ""relatable""...I'm Asian, but not Korean.  The flashbacks were a nice touch, not overdone.  The elderly man was sweet.",1369180800,,196,5.689655172413793

5047362,4,B0071CWXJG,"Great performances by all actors. The story line was engaging and easy to follow. There were many great shots of food preparation that made me hungry and I was forced to go get Korean BBQ. I love how the competition resolves(Sorry no spoilers). I would have liked more back story and development of the mother and her relationship with her children. She was an interesting character. I felt that she lived a complicated, yet full life, that would have been intriguing to explore. I would also liked to know what happened to the fathers of BOTH of the children. I highly recommend this movie. It is fun, entertaining and has a heart-warming message. Just be prepared to want Korean Food when you finish watching. =)",1417910400,,714,4.72

5047367,5,B0071CWXJG,Worth watching!,1410566400,,15,7.0
5047368,2,B0071CWXJG,The movie was good but paused for long intervals particularly near the end which made watching the movie very  frustrating.  I wanted to buy the movie but I decided no for that reason.,1408665600,,184,4.545454545454546
5047369,4,B0071CWXJG,Such a cute movie,1408406400,,17,3.5
5047370,4,B0071CWXJG,Fun and poignant at the same time!! A great introduction to Korean life and attitudes!! Makes me want to visit!!,1407888000,,112,4.65
5047371,3,B0071CWXJG,"This film is lack of developing stories. Most of small stories in the film pop up out of the blue. But, a variety of Korean foods with fantastic looks are really nice ! Yum",1406505600,,172,4.088235294117647
5047372,2,B0071CWXJG,This movies makes me fall asleep every time. Can never finish it.,1406160000,,65,4.5
5047373,3,B0071CWXJG,"Altho I read the part where it was said that this would be a DV-R disc, I was very disappointed at the clarity of the movie.  Hereafter, I will make it a point to note whether the movie is in HD.  The story-line was good - the food portrayed was good.  Would I buy it again?  No.",1399593600,,279,3.8421052631578947
5047374,4,B0071CWXJG,It's a great touching story that relates to how a chief cooks the food. But I wish they can show more details of how to prepare the food.,1398211200,,137,3.9285714285714284
5047375,5,B0071CWXJG,"The title indicates that it's a sequel - I never saw the first movie, but that didn't seem to matter. I had no trouble following the storyline, and really, I think this deserves to stand alone as its own piece. Stylistically, it's very well done, and the story, characters, and themes are all unexpectedly compelling. As someone raised in Western society, it's an interesting, unique, and valuable insight into certain aspects of Korean culture - much of the content is centered around food, but at its core, the movie seems to be more about family. I'm not really one to be moved to tears by movies, but I was surprised (and impressed?) when I was unable/unwilling to keep myself from crying /several/ times.
Yes, you should watch this. It's a good movie.",1396396800,3,756,4.734848484848484
5047376,5,B0071CWXJG,INteresting movie Le Grand Chef 1 was better (better main character) but learned a lot about kimchi from this one.,1395705600,,114,4.75
5047377,5,B0071CWXJG,"I saw some of the reviews before watching this movie. Some were commenting about the food and some were commenting that this was a poorly made movie.  Here is what this movie was truly about.  This movie was about a Mother's love.  The two main characters each had their own misconceptions in the relationship that they had with their mothers.  Those misconceptions were holding them back from truly being themselves.  Once they were able to finally see the truth for what it was it allowed them to be whole.  I think that the worldwide concept being used in this movie holds true, due to the fact that I am not Korean yet I leave this movie feeling these mothers love and feeling that I too love them.",1392595200,3,702,4.488188976377953
5047378,2,B0071CWXJG,The food looks delicious.  The storyline is fraught with random emotional outbursts that come from left field.  No character development and poor story planning.,1391212800,,161,5.666666666666667
5047379,3,B0071CWXJG,Good presentation of Korean food and cooking but didn't develop the characters enough so that we could really identify with their situation,1390176000,,139,5.363636363636363
5047380,4,B0071CWXJG,I very much enjoyed Le Grand Chef and will watch it again. Though this one has the same amazing food images. It lacks the charm of writing that its predecessor had.,1390089600,,164,4.32258064516129
5047381,4,B0071CWXJG,"Its a cute movie with a genuine story, I really enjoyed it, I especially enjoy culinary themed movies! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry! !",1389398400,,150,4.206896551724138
5047382,1,B0071CWXJG,"If you love non-sequiturs and a movie that needs more editing this movie is for you!
This movie could have easily had an hour less of fluff and random scenes revolving around the central ""theme.""

Dad and I thought it was a 1 but my mom enjoyed the nostalgia and the ""theme"" throughout.

tldr; better Korean movies out there, sequel is underwhelming. (Korean manga book is much better too)",1388275200,,389,4.6231884057971016
5047383,5,B0071CWXJG,One of the most touching movies I have seen.  My tears couldn't stop rolling down at the end of the competition.  Highly recommended!,1386892800,,133,4.739130434782608
5047384,4,B0071CWXJG,"Yes, this a family feud between sister & brother.  Movie is quite good.  I could not like the girl, but was gratified to see her growth into understanding her family and the importance of family and Kimchi!",1382313600,,206,4.54054054054054
5047385,4,B0071CWXJG,"Just like the first one, good movie and good story. I really love their presentation on Korean food, look so nice.",1380153600,,114,4.476190476190476
5047386,5,B0071CWXJG,"Loved vignettes throughout the character development.  It will make a great Mother's Day movie!  If you don't love kimchi after this, you have no seoul.",1375142400,,152,5.04
5047387,4,B0071CWXJG,I was hungry for days after watching this movie. Who knew watching a movie about food will make you hungry!,1374364800,,107,4.4
5047388,5,B0071CWXJG,"After viewing ""jewel in the palace"" (dae jang geum) i was hooked for life.  I have sought out korean movies and drama's since.  This movie was not the best i have seen.  It was entertaining tho.  I will give it a five.  It's really unfair to rate korean movies and drama's to hollywoods.  When it comes to hollywood movies really do bottom out at a 1.  Korean movies and drama are not perfect but still on average seem to outclass american works by far.  Imagine seeing pretty much everything hollywood has ever produced.  A now boring place.  Then discovering a whole new world that meets or exceeds anything hollywood has ever produced.  I liked love story.. but almost every korean drama makes that look like seem like normal and not an exception.  If you can stand subtitles  this is a good watch.  If not there is a whole wonderful world you are probably missing out on.  This movie and it's precursor are a nice break in reality and a nice look into another culture.",1373932800,2,972,4.505747126436781
5047389,5,B0071CWXJG,"`Le Grand Chef 2, Kimchi Battle' begins its story in Japan (dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles in these scenes) where Jang-Eun (played by Kim Jang-Eun) has spent the last 10 years becoming a master chef with an aptitude for creating fusion cuisine.  Jang-Eun utilizes these skills in preparing ""Korean"" dishes for a Korean diplomat and his wife.  Upon their sampling the dishes, the Japanese host declares that these delicious dishes originated in Japan.  So begins the Kimchi battle, restoring Kimchi to its rightful place in Korea.

Although the Kimchi battle is the premise of the film, it all really boils down to a mother's love and the most valuable gift she can give you that feeds and nourishes both your body and soul.  This is particularly poignant when you consider the struggles on the Korean peninsula in the relatively recent past.

Additionally, for those who are familiar with the 2008 Korean drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Korean-TV-Drama-2-pack-The-Grand-Chef-Vol-1-Vol-2/dp/B004K5AB0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Korean TV Drama 2-pack: The Grand Chef Vol 1 + Vol 2</a>, you will likely find yourself comparing the film to the drama.  'Le Grand Chef 2, Kimchi Battle' released on January 28, 2010 is a spin-off of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Grand-Chef/dp/B0074BMQDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Grand Chef</a>, but in many ways, follows the same storyline as the drama with some notable differences.

In regard to Sung-Chan, Jang-Eun's brother in the film version, he is portrayed very much the same way in both.  Although I still prefer Kim Rae Won in the role (he portrayed Sung-Chan in the drama version), Jin Goo along with the other actors in the film are talented in their own right.  Given the strength of these actors and the well-written script, you will eventually be pulled in.

I highly recommend both the film and drama versions.",1372896000,7,1970,5.689419795221843

8508285,5,B0071CWXJG,"Korean movies are favorite of mine. Family values, national pride, history and food are bed rocks of their films and dramas. This one did not disappoint. Jin Goo is an excellent actor with a wide range. This time he plays a quite role as an everyday common person. And he can cook so can his sister. And the we have the hook for the movie. Add in a dying mother and a restaurant  with an uncertain future. The national kim chee competition is just spectacular. I had to go buy some kim chee after watching this. Eat before you view.",1461024000,,532,4.32
8508286,4,B0071CWXJG,"Korean movie that introduces Korean cuisine featuring Kimchi, a staple in any Korean meal.  Beautiful back story on the love of a mother and the connection of food.
