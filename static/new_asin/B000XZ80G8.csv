8230330,5,B000XZ80G8,Two softcore flicks that use to play on channels such as Cinemax. It's a good value that has the likes of Porn Stars such as Venus and Wendy Divine. I think they were 4:3 Full-screen. We need more two packs like this.,1402012800,,217,4.190476190476191

""Confessions of an Adult Film Star"" certainly is the better of the two features, with some really great simulated sex (very realistic) but also some really horrible simulated sex (close-up reveals very plainly that you are not seeing penetration). Several brief stories are depicted with real adult film stars in fake situations, done a lot like the film series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voyeur/dp/B0002AHVMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voyeur</a>. Sort of an improve style with lots of shifts in time that are not seamless. Interesting to see and definitely not dull.

None of the women here really are knockouts and that docks the score just a bit. As much as I dislike  Nicole Sheridan, her chapter probably is the best. Her sex scenes are the most believable and she has several really incredible shots from behind that just look fantastic, the best that I've ever seen her look.

""Undercover Sex"" is a suspense film with absolutely no suspense. We're shown who the killer is from the opening scene, and don't worry...no O. Henry ending. The over-used Beverly Lynne is our protagonist. She looks  about as good here as ever, but I'm just not a fan. Although she is a very good actress...can't figure out why she couldn't, or didn't want to, go mainstream.

Anyway, this movie is really dull aside from some pretty hot sequences with Wendy Divine (brief graphic nudity, great stripping scenes). Nothing special and on its own might be a three-star release.",1285200000,2,1581,5.229249011857707
