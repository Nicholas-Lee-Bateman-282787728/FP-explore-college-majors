7914257,1,B00000K4Z7,I recommend you read the original journies to the west. I saw this show on TV a while ago. It seems to me everytime they make a story based off journies to the west it is always either uninteresting or Cheesy witness Dragonball/Z/GT. The Character designs are great. Though good art can't save a bad cartoon/anime. Pretty dull read the original story.,1043712000,,351,4.67741935483871
7914258,5,B00000K4Z7,"During my visit to China,our travel guide told me stories about Monkey King, one of four pilgrims on a Journey to the West in search of the Buddhist scriptures.  ""Monkey Magic"" is based on the classic Chinese fantasy novel, ""Journey to the West"" written over four hundred years ago.  I wanted to share these stories with my boys, so I purchased all 3 DVD's which start with the birth of Stone Monkey or Kongo and ends with his rescue by the Tang priest and the start of their quest.  We enjoyed these wonderfully animated cartoons & my boys were eager to hear more stories and adventures about Monkey King.  I only wish that Bandai Entertainment would create more episodes of Monkey Magic since they end the tale where it's really just beginning.",1017360000,4,746,4.628787878787879

They were soooooo bad, bad action, sleazy storeyline, and absolutely terrible dubbing, but sooooo remarkably funny....",994723200,7,339,5.277777777777778
