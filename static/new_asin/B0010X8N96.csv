8239126,5,B0010X8N96,"I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about, but this DVD is definitely anamorphic 16:9 widescreen.

For any Mountaineer fan, this DVD is a must own, as the 2008 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl is arguably the greatest bowl win for WVU.  The 2006 Sugar Bowl was good, but too close to enjoy until the game was over.  WVU just dominated Oklahoma the whole time in this one.  Considering the Mountaineers were coming off of the worst defeat in the school's history and the acrimonious departure of their head coach, all of the odds were stacked against them.  However, with the contributions of Pat White, Noel Devine, folk hero Owen Schmitt, and the rest of the team under the leadership of Bill Stewart, WVU proved 49 out of 50 states wrong in their predictions and sent a definitive signal that WVU football is incredibly underrated.

In all fairness, I might want to rate this DVD four stars, but I do feel compelled to counteract the other guy who reviewed the DVD before it came out, rating it one star for something that doesn't even apply.  Why would I might want to rate it four stars?  Well, each quarter of play is its own chapter on the DVD.  When the particular chapter completes, it kicks you back to the main menu!  That means you can't just watch the game from 15:00 in the first to 0:00 in the fourth uninterrupted.  I'm not sure why they did that, but to their credit, Owen's tearful post-game speech is on this DVD in the game itself.  Any West Virginian can tell you, that speech means a lot to us.  Thank YOU, Owen!

Bottom line: Great game.  Good DVD.  Anamorphic widescreen, not full screen.  Mountaineer fans will love it, Big East fans will like it, and any fan of football would enjoy it . . . except for Oklahoma fans, that is.",1204588800,4,1752,4.476340694006309

Im def not going to get this unless it comes out in widescreen. Just another example of a bad decision by execs who are not in touch with the customer.",1202256000,2,292,4.232142857142857
