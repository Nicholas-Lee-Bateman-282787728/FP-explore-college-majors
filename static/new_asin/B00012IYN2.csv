1967877,4,B00012IYN2,"That's what I did. And, one of these days I may just get around to buying a drumkit. In the meantime, while I'm still in the 'screwin around on my buddies kit' stage, this showed me pretty much everything I needed to know. Nothin fancy, just a pro session drummer showing you enough simple beats so you can learn to play in your first cover band. If you get this and you do decide to invest in a kit, after you learn a few of these simple beats invest in lessons from a good local teacher. This delivers almost everything it promises except it doesn't teach you how to tune your kit. But it does teach you  about playing  on cardboard boxes with sticks, a good way to learn ifyou're on a tight budget and not sure you're ready to commit.",1218585600,,737,4.219858156028369
1967878,4,B00012IYN2,"If you are starting from zero or limited drum skills, this is a great beginning tool.

What I like is that it is very simple, and each style lesson has a four camera split that lets you see each drum as it is played.

Also each lesson is arranged so each it  builds on the next , and each subsequent lesson is a variation of  the previous usually adding a a kick drum or hi hat beat on the ""and"" part of the count.

If you really practiced each lesson for a week and got it down , you would be a fairly competent drummer in less that 3 months.

He even teaches the 60's song ""wipe out"" as a bonus.

The only thing I wish he would have added would be some ""rolls"" and include a floor tom.

No dvd can be perfect , but for the money you can't go wrong.",1211155200,,750,3.8562091503267975
1967879,5,B00012IYN2,"Surprisingly, as advertised, it COULD get anyone playing a drum set right off the bat.  Wish I'd had it when I first started out, but I derived useful tips and ideas from it even now.  I couldn't recommend it any more highly for anyone who wants to be able to just sit down and play right off the bat, without taking lessons, and with or without the ability to read music.",1199664000,,372,4.225352112676056
1967880,4,B00012IYN2,"This was exactly the type of instruction I was looking for -- a split screen that shows what each element is doing and shows how to put them together. The only drawback was that there were only a few rock beats, which are what I was most interested in. Much of the DVD is devoted to beats I don't think I would use, such as waltz, country, boogie woogie, etc.",1198972800,2,359,4.142857142857143
1967881,5,B00012IYN2,"Starts right out with some good drumming. Easy to follow and understand. I feel like it is worth the money. If you learn the beats and practice, it could have you playing in a band pretty quickly.",1197763200,,196,4.324324324324325
1967882,4,B00012IYN2,"Excelent video for anyone starting to play the drums , Paul Murski takes you on a simple basic approach to several music styles , the split screens and the 1,2,3,4 steps are easy to follow (  yet difficult to master )if you have your drums set in front of the TV you can quickly catch on , I don`t give it 5 stars , because I think it lacks (since its so basic ) a little explanation on the basics , such as how to hold the sticks , hit the drums , arrange them , etc.. still , an excelent purchase",1184544000,,498,3.8823529411764706
1967883,3,B00012IYN2,"Shows the basic beats for different musical styles in a very simple straightforward manner. Does this very nicely. Does not go over any technique or form which is critical! For example, if you're banging from the elbows instead of the wrists you're going to develop problems. That's why only 3 stars. Goes great in combination with the DVD by Tommy Igoe - Getting Started On Drums which does go over basic technique for beginners. I rate that one 5 stars",1169856000,12,454,4.6875
1967884,5,B00012IYN2,"It is fun and easy to follow DVD, it teaches some basics. It shows some beats from many different styles and in general set good mood and attitude. If you are first time drummer it is one of these DVDs to get. It gives you some basic tools to fill in almost every possible gig, but then you will figure out which is yours. If you want to further into blues, I would recommend ""Blues Drums"" DVD by Dave Russell as it is very deep. This DVD taught some sweet beats for all kind of music and I liked it a lot. Get it as it provides a good prospective on many aspects of drumming and set things right from the beginning.",1169424000,,616,4.057377049180328
1967885,5,B00012IYN2,This is actually one of the first things i got when i first started playing. and its great! It really teaches you a lot easilly and straight to the point. This dvd teaches you how to play the basic beats to all kinds of music ranging from 50's rock to punk to reggae to even swing! and at the end it even has a suprise drum thing for you to learn and also towards the very end explains how to even use cardboard boxes and even your hands and legs to play the drums. even if you are just thinking about getting a drumset its still worth getting.,1148083200,4,544,4.046296296296297
1967886,5,B00012IYN2,"Grab some sticks and cardboard boxes, the whole family will have a blast, tapping along to Paul Murski's light and amusing approach to learning basic drums. All of the basic beats are covered here, including rock, 3/4 and country. And it's all in a conversational fashion that is not condescending or pushy. The split screen style allows you to easily see what each limb is supposed to be doing. His tips are helpful, and he even gets his sons involved. There's a surprise lesson at the end as a bonus involving one of our favorite genre's - surf. We don't want to work, we just want to bang on the drum all day. Thanks, Paul!",1142294400,12,626,4.452173913043478

8005588,4,B00012IYN2,"If you buy this with your first drum kit as I did it will get you playing real songs in no time. A good companion to Tommy Igoe's ""Getting Started on the Drums""",1425772800,,160,3.878787878787879
8005589,4,B00012IYN2,This was for my little boy who was learning drums but wanted to advance quicker than the lessons were going. It was good for showing how to make basic style beats. Easy to follow for me. The kid followed it alright too. It's been a good reference to go back to.,1400976000,,261,4.137254901960785
8005590,2,B00012IYN2,"My 6 year old wants to play drums, so I got him a pair of junior sticks and this DVD.

The blurb says ""you don't even need a drum set, you can practice with cardboard boxes"".

The problem is, the DVD doesn't show that until the absolute end, and is just a 2 minute segment.

There is no instruction on how to hold the sticks, how to hit, how to sit, or anything the rank beginner would need.
Since the beginning player won't be practicing with a band anytime soon, the 4 man band goes way over the heads.

He's obviously very good, and this DVD would help someone who already knows how to use the sticks on their way to proficiency without needing to go to a coach or get lessons every week.

But, this DVD is just a copy from an older VHS, the production quality is low, and its not for real beginners.  So I'm disappointed with the contents, but keeping it because it will be useful as the 2nd and 3rd steps in learning to play the drums.  It's just not the 1st step.",1346889600,,969,4.122340425531915
8005591,5,B00012IYN2,I like this self taught Video.  He is very effective.  No BS like others.,1259539200,,73,4.142857142857143
8005592,4,B00012IYN2,"Its ok . Good for beginners , mostly flat out drumming styles and beats .
Nothing about transitioning or a few rolls in between thos would have been good to have.

8005593,5,B00012IYN2,My boy has picked up a lot from this Video and I highly recommend it. After hearing/seeing the first film about the Rock rithm he could play the rithm himself! We will continue with the other rithms.,1243814400,,199,4.405405405405405
8005594,2,B00012IYN2,I was hoping to use this video w/ my kids- isn't really directed towards a younger audience,1229385600,,91,4.411764705882353
8005595,5,B00012IYN2,"I am so glad I first bought this DVD before any other. I had never played drums before and this DVD showed to play along (basic grooves) with some of my favorite songs. Thanks to that, I did not give up because I was not overwhelmed from the start. After that, because this DVD shows you very little technique, I bought Tommy Igoe's beginner's and loved it. Then I got Jon Peckman's Picture Yourself Drumming. I have to say that this DVD made it easier for me to learn from the other DVDs, which are more informative, and more challenging from the start.
 I recommend it if you are an absolute beginner and if you are the type of person who gets easily discouraged if something seems too challenging.",1225584000,,700,4.426356589147287
