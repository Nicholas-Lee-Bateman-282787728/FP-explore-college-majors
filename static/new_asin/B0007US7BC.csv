2244691,4,B0007US7BC,"First of all, I have to say, though confusing, Hellraiser six was better than Deader. And Deader could have been better if it had used more foreshadowing as six did. The potential was there, and some of the deleted scenes would have improved it. Don't get me wrong, Deader was certainly better than five. All the Hellraiser movies are better than five, which was basically a bad cop story with Hellraiser-ish overtones. While Deader didn't add anything new to the story, aside from (Oops! Spoiler!)  giving the latest Merchant incarnation an interesting ability, it didn't contradict anything from the previous movies either. In other words, it was very formulaic. Considering it was shot in twenty-seven days, that's to be expected I suppose.

The DVD also has a ""gag reel"" which wasn't very big, but I got a kick out of seeing ol' Pinny flub his lines and start laughing. Nothing like a seeing a man with pins in his head start chortling non-fiendishly to make you crackup.

For fans of the late sci-fi show Sliders, the main character is Kari Wuhrer, the woman who played Maggie. I found her character in Hellraiser to be very Maggie-ish in that both are pretty hardboiled personalities. It does make me wonder about her range as an actress though. :/

I haven't watched all the commentary yet (there are two different commentaries), but the movie was a good effort. I was already prepared to be disappointed... being a fan is always good preparation for disappointment, but I'm hoping eight will be better.",1118361600,4,1510,4.841085271317829
2244692,3,B0007US7BC,"In all fairness its way better then ""Inferno"" for the handful, including myself who watched that one.  Interestingly enough, I gave this movie three stars because the story is pretty interesting and not gonna lie...the lead actress is a hottie!  But the movie is still the 7 installment in the series so obviously there are flaws in the film...Hell its a direct to video hellraiser flick!  But this one holds its own on the grounds that you are always interested in what the hell is going on?  The first 15 minutes are pretty intense with a gun shot suicide and a girl found strangled in her underwear in her bathroom.

All in all...The movie is not bad, but the flaws (bad acting, what not) are aparent.  Pinhead does not even really come into the story until the ending, which is somewhat cool.

so...If you find it...pick it up.  If you wait a while, don't worry...it will still be here!",1118275200,4,890,4.553459119496855
2244693,3,B0007US7BC,"Well, it seems that Pinhead is back, but takes nearly an hour to show up in this latest opus.  I am a real fan of Part One and especially III, the rest really I could care less and this one is one of them.  Part ""The Ring"" and part ""Star Wars"" this film borrows more from other films than its own franchise.  Still, like Darth Vader, when Pinhead is on screen he IS awesome and makes up for the slow pacing.  The film does pull together nicely by the end, but it is a long journey coming.  Fans of the series will still find the usual gore galore.",1118188800,3,547,4.027777777777778
2244694,4,B0007US7BC,"I went in to this movie with really low expectations.  I had not been to happy with the last few Hellraiser films, mainly because they didn't feel like Hellraiser movies at all.  Well, this one still feels distant from the core Hellraiser material, but it's nowhere near as far out as parts five and six.

Actually, once Pinhead and the other cenobites show up, it makes sense.  He isn't in the movie much, and focus is more on the lead actress just trying to understand what she had gotten herself in to.  It works for the most part.

I was surprised at how gritty this movie was as well.  The violence is intense, and there is a good deal of nudity (mostly female, but a bit of male).  The sexual edge that was present in the original Hellraiser is back.

Die hard Hellraiser fans will probably hate this movie.  It is way more pulpy in feel.  It is grittier than Inferno and Hellseeker, but it still lacks the down to earth feel of the first movie, or the fairy tale horror of the second.  Still, it works, and delivers in the disturbing imagery, hardcore gore, dark sexuality, and all while keeping some decent acting and a fairly strong script.  Not bad at all.",1118102400,60,1166,4.417840375586854
2244695,4,B0007US7BC,"Hellraiser: Deader continues to take the franchise in the direction that Hellseeker did, with  a darker tale of morality that Clive Barker had intended for the series.  Strong story, strong visuals, strong cast.  One of the best horror movies to come out this year.

The scare filled plot is full of twists and turns while continuing to expand on Barker's mythology with some nice inside winks to longtime fans.

True Hellraiser fans will put this in their top three along with Hellraiser and Hellbound followed closely by Hellseeker.

Fans of the cheesier Hellraiser 3 & 4 may be dissappointed in less Pinhead, but less definitely is more in this latest installment given 3 out of four stars from Fangoria Magazine.",1118016000,12,716,4.925
2244696,2,B0007US7BC,"Ok, the first Hell Raiser was a serious, horrific, poetic, and gory masterpiece from Clive Barker himself.

 The next 3 sequals were not too bad, though they removed a touch of seriousness and replaced that with a hint of Comic book action, but none the less, they were VERY good, and nearly worthy of the Hell Raiser title despite the handful of contradictions they raised up, such as Pin Head's motives and purpose as in part 3.

 This movie, like 5, 6, and 7, it has no hope for. At this point in the story what really needs to be done is Pinhead needs tossed out of the picture since he is only a mere ""worker bee"" for Hell anyhow, and is not what the Hellraiser universe is supposed to be about anyhow.

 The sad thing about this film is it did not start life as a Hell Raiser film, rather a last minute decision was made to take the script amnd toss some Hellraiser elements into it.

 The effects are great, the actors are good (and I've never seen any of there faces before, the way I like it), the story itself almost had hope, but the story drags on and on and on and on and on, just part 7. It becomes a series of pointless flashbacks and what not, which seem to be there just to drag the story out for an hour and a half.

 As before, I'm still convinced that this story died after part 4, and even 2 - 3 were not near as good as one, but at least they were interesting and tried to do something creative with the Hellraiser world.",1117756800,4,1443,4.139784946236559
2244697,4,B0007US7BC,"Of course, I haven't seen the film yet.  But it's kind of troubling what happening to this franchise.  TWO sequels have been sitting in the can for about two years or so, languishing while Dimension Films, which own the rights to the series now, have released such trash as Halloween: Resurrection.

The Hellraiser franchise did not have to theatrically and commercially die this way.  If they can churn out Freddy, Jason, Myers, and Chucky flicks, no doubt they can entertain with some more bloody and demented tales of the Cenobites.  Oh well.  Suffice to say this will be a must for the Hellraiser fan.

I have no doubt that some hack will also pick up this series and try to totally restart it in Hollywood, where every drop of money will be squeezed from every forgotten franchise.",1117152000,5,786,4.693430656934306
2244698,5,B0007US7BC,"In my opinion, this is the best horror series ever made. It's dark, witty and sure delves into the human mind, psyche and investigates the grotesqueries of human nature. Everybody knows we are born evil and the series show that not only are we born evil, we also become more and more evil when we do not limit ourselves to an ordinary life. HELLRAISER 1 portrays the life of a depraved individual and how it affects his relatives. HELLRAISER 2 is about a mundane brain surgeon who believes death is the 4th dimension and spares no expense to see what there is beyond this so-called real world. HELLRAISER 3 is about a demon who is free to roam the earth and wreak havoc. HELLRAISER 4 is about the eternal battle between good VS evil that plagues a cursed family through generations because they made the box that opens the gates of hell. From pts. 1 through 4 there's gore galore,graphic violence and plenty of taboo subjects, such as bondage - S&M.HELLRAISER 5 is about a corrupt police officer who seeks the ENGINEER - a  faceless serial killer from HELL.HELLRAISER 6 is about troubled Kristy (the cute girl from HELLRAISER 1)and her braindamaged husband who are involved in a riddle. HELLRAISER 7 (this one) is about a sect who worships the DEVIL (aka LEVIATHAN - the LORD OF THE LABYRINTH) and a journalist who investigates mysterious and bizarre incidents. HELLRAISER 8 is about the INTERNET,which is used by the devil to seduce and kill whoever visits HELLWORLD - the website. From pts. 5 through 8 , gore is minimal,so is graphic violence. The atmosphere ,though, is still dark, and all HELLRAISER elements are present here - HUMAN BEINGS ARE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES.Parts 1, 5,6,7 & 8 are like the  HELLRAISER graphic novels published a decade ago. The CENOBITES are not the stars of the show - they just happen to be there and enrich the stories. There are different CENOBITES for different occasions. Parts 2, 3 & 4 are more centered (but not that much - except part 3)on PINHEAD,and once again NEW DIFFERENT CENOBITES turn up,because like one of the HELLRAISER comic books stated,different CENOBITES are required for different types of jobs. All CENOBITES are  bizarre metal, leather & flesh reconfigurations. I like other horror series out there, but none is as  visually rich,enigmatic and captivating as HELLRAISER - it's like a puzzle that offers different answers .PINHEAD is forever, so is this series, regardless of what some wannabe critics and pseudo intellectuals or frustrated script writers & lousy movie directors say. I already bought from AMAZON parts 7 & 8 and I am drooling for more ... HELLRAISER !!!!!!",1115337600,38,2649,4.828193832599119

2244730,4,B0007US7BC,"The  continues to expand the Hellraiser mythology, although with less impact here than before. Whereas parts I-IV revolve around the Box or Pinhead (Doug Bradley), parts V-VI and this chapter are illustrative of what experiences befall those damned souls who open the Box. Thus, we see much less of Pinhead and focus more on our curious and potentially damned soulsas it probably should be. Now with part VII, Amy's journey begins as a rational investigation of something potentially supernatural, shifts to supernatural experiences of her own, and ultimately steers us into what feels like a surreal dreamscape of her life.

Meet Amy (Kari Wuhrer; Eight-Legged Freaks, Sharknado 2), a top-notch undercover investigative reporter.  She does whatever it takes to nail the major scoops and now shes been recruited to investigate the ""deaders,"" a group of Romanian cultists who appear to be able to resurrect the recently deceased following ritual suicide.

Upon arrival in Bucharest everything seemswell, appropriately wrong given this is a Hellraiser movie.  A lead's apartment wreaks of rotting flesh and flies, and houses a dead body clutching the Puzzle Box artifact after an apparent suicide.  A video from the suicide victim admonishes us not to ""open"" the box.  Which, of course, cues Amy's interest to do exactly that.

From the moment the Puzzle Box is opened we are struck with the hooked-chain urgency of the old days.  Well, perhaps it's a bit weakened by the CGI.  But whatever, they're trying.  An unfortunate trend in this franchise is that the effects go from ""Holy S*** Awesome"" (for their time and even today) in parts I-II, to pretty good in III-IV, to typical direct-to-DVD in V-VI.  But fret not, it's all still quite entertaining and Pinhead's tissue-rending hooked chains get their pound of flesh.  Some sloppy gory scenes are present, but its just not exactly in the dire theme to which were accustomed.

If anything about this film specifically bothered me, it would be that the new Cenobites don't even seem to matter.  Chatterbox is here and some others.  But they're really just there, offering no substance.  These Cenobites are more akin to Christmas tree ornaments.  You may stop and enjoy noticing one here or there for a fleeting moment, but its the tree (i.e., Amys relationship with the Box) that we truly see.  Even Pinhead is quite downplayed.

At times this movie tries to be a bit too neo-contemporary and, for all its effort to appear in-touch, this makes it feel momentarily out-of-touchlike it's trying too hard to impress us with its self-awareness and social sub-cultured edginess.  Much as Hell on Earth tried and failed to capture the big city club scene, so does Deader fail to capture whatever this all is whether it be afterlife-challenging cultists or trippy underground punks.  Speaking of whom, the Romanian underground subway seems to be a nihilistic Satanic sex trade loaded with disconcerting imagery.

The final act is weird, bloody, weird, trippy, weird, culty and more weird.  The film ends on a dark cyclical note after a finale offering honestly no satisfaction other than a gory rending, but that's perfectly fine with me.  I enjoyed most of the movie, so I won't let the last five minutes ruin the experience.

Parts I-III of this franchise should be watched in order. After seeing them, there seems to be no consequence to seeing part V, VI or VII before part IV outside of the fact that Bloodline is much better. This film is nothing special, nor is it even a good Hellraiser storyyet its not bad either.  I take it for what it is and appreciate of it what I can. I didn't regret watching it, andwhile I wouldnt necessarily highly recommend it to viewersI have, in fact, seen it about four times now.  Its pretty neat.

Overall, I was pleased with this as a direct-to-DVD horror film, but maaaaybe a tad disappointed as a major Hellraiser fan.  In either case, I'd still recommend it.  But only AFTER seeing parts I-IV.",1477353600,,3981,4.9324324324324325

2244742,2,B0007US7BC,"HELLRAISER VI:: DEADER is yet another cynical attempt by the owners of the franchise to wring coinage out of the pockets of naive, trusting fans of Clive Barker's original 1987 film. As a rule, I'm not the sort to take issue with people who hold different aesthetic opinions than myself, because to each his own and all that; but in this case I suspect who like this film of blinding themselves to its awful reality out of a -- completely understandable -- loyalty to Barker's original concept. My message to these folks is simple: calling a movie HELLRAISER does not HELLRAISER make. All it does is sucker money from your pockets and propagate yet more direct-to-video ""horror movies"" featuring cameo appearances by Doug Bradley.

DEADER is the story of Amy Klein (Kari Whrer), an edgy young London reporter who is put on the trail of a mysterious cult which you have to die to join. Following the story to Rumania, she discovers a a mysterious puzzle box gripped in the hand of a dead member of the cult. After opening the box she begins to hallucinate -- so she thinks -- about a demonic figure with nails in his face (Doug Bradley) who warns her that she is in danger, and to experience flashbacks to a traumatic incident from her youth involving her father. At the same time, her investigation leads her to the cult -- the Deaders -- and its leader, the enigmatic Winter (Paul Rhys), who seems to be a descendant of Lemarchand, the toymaker who created the puzzle box. Winter, who evidently has the power to resurrect the dead, sees himself as the inheritor of the power of the box, but he can't open it; he needs Amy to do this, the catch being she has to join his cult first, i.e. to die and be resurrected by his hand. Amy, naturally, doesn't want to die, but an encounter with a kitchen knife makes this desire somewhat academic. The question then becomes, who will she turn to? The demonic entity Pinhead, or Winter?

I'll start with what works about the film, because believe me, it won't take long. DEADER is executed fairly professionally for a B movie, and utilizes the gritty, morally decayed atmosphere of Bucharest with some effectiveness. The cult concept is interesting and the way it is introduced to the audience, via a videotape of a young woman committing suicide with a pistol, is suitably disturbing. There is a modestly interesting (and very gruesome) sequence with Pinhead and two Cenobites at the climax, and Whrer is easy to look at and tries hard to bring some genuine emotion to her cliched role as a cynical, chain-smoking investigative reporter. Aside from the somewhat clever device of using a subway train to host a nonstop Roman-style debauchery, that is about all I can say in the positive about this flick.

Now for the bad news. Well, for starters, the movie is boring. I mean really, really boring. The pace is glacial, and while something is always threatening to happen, it very rarely does -- and WHEN it does, it usually turns out to be a dream or a hallucination, which gives the movie an incoherent feel (a flaw shared by HELLSEEKER and INFERNO). This incoherency increases as the film wears on, because in addition to being surreal, the story is riddled with plot holes. Take Winter, for example. We're told he's descended from the guy who created the box and that he feels he's its rightful master. Fine. But where does his power to resurrect the dead come from? And if he's so powerful, why, when he is finally confronted by Pinhead, does he prove to be so completely helpless? Why doesn't resurrection protect the cult members from the Cenobites? What is so great about coming back to life if you have to carry around the disgusting wound that killed you? And what about Amy Klein? Half the things that happen to her may not actually be happening, or are happening only in her head, or are happening and not happening at the same time. And her backstory might have been relevant to the movie's original script, but it makes no sense to the one they actually shot. The revelation that she was abused is simply irrelevant and brings nothing to the story. I could go on, but I'll simply say that the real flaw of the movie, the one that fathers all the others, is that despite employing the use of the box, the appearance of Pinhead and even a descendant of Lemarchand, there is no real feeling that this movie understands or belongs within the 'Raiser canon. There is good reason for this. DEADER is, in fact, a classic example of what happens when a Hollywood script is given the ""HOWLING 2 treatment."" In that case, witless studio executives, trying to cash in on the success of the first movie without exerting themselves, got hold of an old vampire script, scratched out ""vampire"" and substituted ""werewolf,"" leading to a film of ludicrously bad proportions. As the audio commentary on DEADER reveals, the same thing happened here, except that the execs simply tacked the box, Pinhead and a few chains onto an existing script about a reporter investigating a supernatural cult. The result is this sluggish, muddled, confused, dreary, extremely bloody but decidedly unscary mess.

I read a review here that says that ""true fans"" will appreciate this film. I take umbrage with that. True fans recognize this tacked-on mess of a DTV movie for exactly what it is: a clumsy attempt by studio execs to conduct an overpriced tour of the wreckage of a once-mighty franchise.
The sad thing is, I wouldn't mind being exploited this way if, in satisfying their greed, those same execs also happened to make a decent movie, but DEADER is not decent. It's not even mediocre. It's just dumb.",1425600000,,5629,4.688574317492416

2244745,3,B0007US7BC,"It's pretty apparent that this is another ""Hellraiser"" film that is based on a spec script that was altered to fit the ""Hellraiser"" brand. With that said, this one feels pretty close to an organic ""Hellraiser"" movie, and better yet, this is the first ""Hellraiser"" film since ""Bloodlines"" where Pinhead's appearance and actions actually make sense.

An investigative reporter, Amy Klein, is sent to Romania to follow up on a video her editor received showing what looks like a ritualistic suicide/murder and the victim's rebirth. There is a strange cult in Bucharest led by a man named Winter that calls themselves the ""Deaders"". When Amy arrives at the apartment where the video tape was sent from, she finds a young woman's corpse handing in the bathroom. Beside the girl's body is another videotape and in the girl's hand she's holding the infamous puzzle box. Taking the tape and the puzzle box, Amy returns to her hotel room where she watches the tape of the girls pleading for someone to stop the Deaders and Winter, and then Amy opens the puzzle box, opening her up to Pinhead's world.

Where the last two films focused on the personal Hell of the main characters, ""Deader"" gets back to the story of an innocent being pulled into Pinhead's world. Kari Wuhrer is always fun to watch, and does a great job as Amy, her performance carries the film. Doug Bradley's Pinhead is given a bit more to do this time instead of simply being wedged into the film like the previous couple of installments, but he's still not a central characters. Where the movie falls apart is Paul Rhys as ""Winter LeMarchand"". Winter's motivations, and his relationships with the other characters remains vague. We are never sure why he is doing what he does, or how he is able to do what he does? Rhys doesn't have any charisma, and lacks the menace needed to carry the role.

With that said, this is one of the better sequels.",1413417600,2,1905,4.697604790419161

There are parts where the music is too loud and it's hard to hear what they're saying. Pools of Blood? After about the 4th pool of blood it kind of gets cheesy since they is only so much blood in a body, plus if you only stand still for 10 seconds how do you get a pool so big. It's a little beyond believable. Also, there's an obvious mistake at the end, there is blood coming from her mouth in one shot and in the next she's falling and there's no blood, after that there is blood near her mouth again.

Beyond those issues I actually like the movie. I feel like at it's core it's gone back to the original horror of the first movie. The raw terror and feel to the story is back. I feel like that's been missing in 3-5. Even Hellseeker was lacking in some of the original story line type horror, I'd say it was on a whole different level or horror.

There were a few rough spots where I wasn't sure whether the director and writers were going to pull it all together, but for the most part they did.  Doug Bradley once again doing a great job as pinhead.  Seeing him in and out of costume is amazing.

This is certainly a different view of Hell than in the original, so if that's going to bother you, you should skip this one.  Otherwise, I think you will find the movie a good use of your time whether you rent or buy, and after all, isn't that why we watch them.

Kari Wuhrer, probably best known for her work on MTV's Remote Control (although I've never seen Sliders -- I remember her most from her stellar appearance on Conan in the '90s) does an admirable job in an awful movie as Amy, a journalist for an underground London newspaper. She gets sent to Romania on a story to track down a cult leader who can apparently bring the dead back to life by making out with them. This story was originally written as a stand-alone movie, and was altered to become part of the Hellraiser universe. It shows. Er, let's just say it's a colossal bore. Besides one minor flourish when Amy opens the box, Pinhead doesn't bring the pain until the 78 minute mark (The movie is 88 minutes). Too little, too late, jagoffs.

Her attempt to infiltrate their ranks will bring her closer to her own death than she ever imagined! Learning nothing from the failures of the third film, HELLRAISER: DEADER follows yet another news reporter that has become wrapped up in a murderous plot involving everyone's favorite puzzle box. The original script by Full Moon frequent Benjamin Carr had nothing to do with HELLRAISER to begin with, which helps to explain why the plot seems so detached from the series. Kari Wuhrer plays the typical bad girl reporter who is filled with spunk and attitude, but lacks any real personality. Her character is a generic stereotype that fails to involve the audience in her troubles. What is worse, Amy never really uncovers anything useful about the Deaders outside of the location of their hideout, nor does she ever determine how Winter has managed to undermine death, leaving much left unexplained by the ending. While Rick Bota brings back the clean visual palette from HELLSEEKER, nothing in DEADER manages to make up for the bland and boring plot.

Our beloved Pinhead, the beautiful and mysterious puzzle box that gets the ball rolling, and Kirstie Cotton's character going head to head with one of our favorite movie monsters. This story takes a slightly different angle, as does ""Inferno"" and ""Hellseeker"" even though one of our favorite heroins reprises her role from the first two films in ""Hellseeker"". It does get confusing at times but if you pay attention and stick with it, its worth it. The story takes on the journey of others who have the misfortune of crossing paths with the beautiful and mysterious puzzle box that unleashes utter chaos on those who are stupid enough to open it cause it's pretty. The story was interesting and well played and the actors were very good. It pleases me to say how much I enjoyed this movie. It's not our traditional Hellraiser tale but it kinda puts Pinhead's role more in perspective and reveals a little more to nature of the box and its inhabitants. As I said before it may not be our traditional Hellraiser spin, but I like the mix-up and the twists. I fully recommend this to any Hellraiser fans and ask that you give it a chance and draw your own conclusions. I believe it's worth it.

2244782,3,B0007US7BC,"I think if Hollywood were to take anything away from the Hellraiser franchise it would be this: quit being such cheap bstrds out to save a little cash and spring for an original friggin' script! HELLRAISER 7, aka HELLRAISER: Deader (2005) is just yet another in a long line (the third so far) of Hellraiser movies that began life as entirely separate entities. Neither HELLRAISER: Inferno, HELLRAISER: Hellseeker nor HELLRAISER: Deader were written as Hellraiser movies, but Dimension films decided they wanted to make more Hellraiser movies and, to not have to pay for a new, original script, they took some old unproduced scripts off the shelf, did some re-writes to include the Lament Configuration and the Cenobites, and they made their movie. And with each one, they just drive the franchise further and further into the ground. Gone is the once-great mythology, gone is the feeling of menace the Cenobites once inspired, and definitely gone is any of the heart Clive Barker put into his original story so long ago.

HELLRAISER: Deader concerns a hard-nosed reporter, Amy Klein (Kari Wuhrer, ""Sliders""), who is sent by her editor to Romania to chase a story about a man who can bring the dead back to life. Amy's investigation leads her to the apartment of Marla, an ex-cult member who was brought back by the mysterious Winter, but whom Amy finds choked to death. She also finds a scrapbook, a videotape, and a strange little puzzle box. Which she opens. Or imagines she does. It's not really clear, given what we know of the box, if she did or didn't open it, because it sure looked like she did, and she has a brief flash of chains flying out of it and embedding themselves in her head, but then they're gone and she continues on with her evening. So I don't know.

Amy's investigation continues and she finally tracks Winter and his group to an underground cavern where she witnesses another resurrection before finding herself alone with the cult leader who tells her the puzzle box is a family heirloom and rightfully belongs to him. Apparently he is a descendent of the box's maker, LeMarchand, and he wants to harness its power, but is unable to open the box. According to Deader, only a select few can open it. Winter's idea is that if he kills someone and brings them back from the dead, if one of those resurrected people is able to open the box, the fact that they've already died and come back will make them immune to the danger of the Cenobites? It's never really made clear just HOW Winter plans to pull this off. Or if it was, I totally missed it. But I don't think it was.

Anyway, he kills Amy and brings her back, and that's where the movie gets even worse because the entire third act is Amy's waking nightmare, trapped in hell, possibly, and trying to figure out what's going on with her. Why does she have a gaping, bleeding hole in her chest, why doesn't it hurt, why isn't she dying? And why does she keep finding herself waking up in strange places, as if the previous scene were just a dream, only to have the current scene devolve into a similar nightmare, from which she wakes and if the that scene also were a dream. As with the previous two movies, HELLRAISER: Deader feels like an unused episode of ""Freddy's Nightmares"".

Director Rick Bota (HELLRAISER: Hellseeker) puts the dream-like misdirection to good use in this movie, evoking some very creepy images and giving the series the first true sense of dread it's had since the first two movies, but that feeling is based off the surreal nature of the scenes, not because the Cenobites are closing in and going to take anyone to hell. In fact, these last few Hellraiser movies have got to be the easiest work Doug Bradley has ever done in Hollywood. He's practically a day player in these things now. He shows up, puts on his make-up, shoots 5 minutes of footage, and goes back to wherever he came from until he gets the call for the next Hellraiser.

The production design was very nice, mostly where sound was concerned as we've got lots of buzzing flies, things creaking, and rattling chains. For the first time since HELLBOUND: Hellraiser 2, I felt we might actually be reclaiming some of the atmosphere of those first two movies.

The acting in this movie isn't terrible, which is something I totally didn't expect to be saying when I saw Kari Wuhrer was the star. She's not terrible, I don't mean to imply that, but I've yet to see a performance from her that knocked me out. She's an actor, she's not a star, and there's a difference. But in this case, she gave Amy Klein's hard-nosed fear-nothing anything-for-a-story reporter a pretty convincing style and air that came across very well. Then again, isn't the idea of the hard-nosed fear-nothing anything-for-a-story reporter a pretty tired clich by now?

Paul Rhys (FROM HELL) as Winter didn't convince me at all. For one, he looked way too old to be a hip young messiah (he was 42). He looked like the slightly older brother of Kyle MacLachlan, dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, wearing a long beige trench coat and sporting a hip haircut. It's not convincing at all and his acting certainly left a lot to be desired. But his scenes were minimal, so it didn't drag the movie down too much.

As with HELLRAISER: Hellseeker, Deader isn't a terrible movie. In fact, I rather enjoyed the movie. I just think I would have enjoyed it a lot better if it hadn't been tied into the Hellraiser franchise, because as a Hellraiser movie, it fails on a grand scale, just as the previous two movies had done. You can't just take any old random script you have lying around, force a couple of Cenobites and a puzzle box into the story and think that works. A Hellraiser story stems from the box and the Cenobites and what they represent, what they do, and the threat they imply. If your Hellraiser story doesn't start with the Cenobites, it's probably the wrong story, and the more of these retrofitted Hellraiser movies I see, the more I convinced of that single fact.

HELLRAISER: Deader is entertaining, but, again, as a franchise movie, it fails to impress.",1343779200,3,6100,4.635522664199815
2244783,3,B0007US7BC,This is an interesting entry in the Hellraiser franchise.

Nevertheless, what we have here is a pretty poor installment of the ""Hellraiser"" franchise, which serves as the personal turning point for me when following the series ceased being essential. ""Deader"" is a generic horror movie with only a handful of ties to its namesake and even fewer ties to its audience: newcomers to the series will not be successfully initiated and veterans would be generous to see it through to the end.

The story: ""extreme"" reporter Amy Klein (Kari Wuhrer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eight-Legged-Freaks/dp/B002NZK5U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eight Legged Freaks</a>) travels to Bucharest in search of a mysterious cult whose leader (Paul Rhys,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chaplin/dp/B001DE29SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chaplin</a>) possesses the power to bring the dead back to life. Her investigation turns bizarre as she seeks the source of the man's power, tied to an iconic little puzzle box...

Among other complaints often heard about the series' later films is their increasingly vanilla tone. ""Deader"" conforms to this stereotype: the movie does have its share of blood and violence, but there's very little actual gore and few authentic scares. I'll admit that in the right mood, I found ""Inferno"" and even ""Hellseeker"" quite chilling, but here, there's nothing to make me even moderately creeped. The jolts are few and far between (Oh my god, a pigeon!!), a few of the locales are obviously supposed to be spooky but are found wanting (e.g. the train controlled by Marc Warren of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wanted/dp/B001GKJ2E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wanted</a>), and it never really feels like our heroine is being followed or otherwise hopelessly in over her head. Scenes where the film tries to convey her terror and confusion - like when she wakes up with a knife shoved through her back (!) - are so poorly scored and edited that I really don't care what she's going through. Bring on the Cenobites, please, for their total four minutes of screentime.

To the credit of director Rick Bota, he keeps the ""Hellraiser"" films among the more professional-looking franchises on the direct-to-video market: production values are strong and the cinematography is always interesting, which I consider a minor miracle on account of the movie having been filmed in Romania - the home of cheap, grey DTV fare. Sadly, he gives in to other typical DTV shortcuts, such as repetitious flashbacks and the ""when in doubt, zoom in real close on something"" technique of time-killing. The acting performances are serviceable enough, but I wish Doug Bradley's Pinhead had been written a bit more enigmatically: purists already accused the last movie of deteriorating his persona, but here more so he seems to descend to the level of his victims, letting himself be chatted up to some extent for no good reason. Just slap a chain on 'em already!

The recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser-Revelations/dp/B0056P6SOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser: Revelations</a>&nbsp;assures viewers that there's really no limit to how low this series can sink, so again, consider this one a minor blessing: even if ol' Doug has seen brighter days, at least we *can* see him here. There's nothing much to add here, so just know yourself before buying this one. Purists need to stay away, newcomers shouldn't use this to get their first impression of the series, and casual viewers can still potentially be disappointed, so only make the purchase if you know this is what you want to get into.",1314662400,2,4350,6.355329949238579

I watched this movie once but I didn't like it.  After I watched the interview and watched the movie another time, it was kinda ok but the story was still kinda dumb.  From the interview, they said that the original script was not for Hellraiser. But let's make it a Hellraiser movie from the script they said. Maybe that was why the role of the female reporter and the story were so not consistent through out the movie.

From the beginning of the movie, Amy is a tough/fearless reporter who does not have fear of anything. I guess this maybe from the original script written for the reporter. Since this is a Hellraiser movie, Amy is tough in one scene but screaming in another and then back and forth and back and forth again and again. This is so bad.

So, when I watched the movie the second time, I ignored all the screaming and watched Amy as the intended tough reporter, then the movie made more sense.

What is nice, though, is that Doug Bradley is reliable as always as Pinhead and he's actually IN THE FILM, rather than being turned into a cameo as he was in some previous films (note his three or so minutes of screen time in Hellraiser: Inferno).  Kari Wuhrer is a good sport and plays her part perfectly alongside Bradley.  The change of location to the seedy underground of London and then various European locales is a nice change, and I liked the concept of the Deaders.  All in all, the film is an entertaining and consistently enjoyable romp through the world of Pinhead if you're a fan of the series.  It's not nearly as ridiculous and brilliantly hilarious as Hellraiser: Bloodline, but it has its moments.  For those of you not used to the series - some of the foreign actors are a bit sketchy with shaky accents, the screenplay may just as well have been thrown on the floor with scenes acted at random, camera work is on par with most direct-to-video horror films, etc.  If you're a fan, it's a worthy entry.  If you're not, it's probably a waste of time to start with this one - go back to Hellraiser and Hellbound: Hellraiser II.  Or not.

This is saying a lot, considering how many other arrogant characters have been strewn about the plot.  (In fact, if you can last up to twenty seconds into the final credits, the eighth character listed is called The Arrogant Reporter, and they aren't referring to Amy Klein).

Amy's boss, Charles Richmond, endures her with the same snarky respect that you can find in any other boss with a brilliant but reckless charge: M from Bond, Lois Lane's boss (all I can remember is they called him Chief), and whoever happens to be Will Smith's supervisor in three out of four Will Smith movies.  You growl, you make snide comments, and then you let your star employee do his/her thing.  In an intro gorged with exposition, Charles reveals that this time around he has a special assignment for Amy.  It comes in the form of a video tape.

The tape is from a girl who is documenting a group of people known as Deaders, nihilistic ne'er-do-wells led by a man called Winter.  ""Fear is the place we go to learn,"" Winter says to a young redhead, in one of the movie's few good lines.  (Carr must've known it was good; it is repeated several times.)  In the video, the redhead repeats phrases like ""I'm not real,"" and ""Nothing's real,"" before finally killing herself.  Then, somehow, Winters brings her back to life.  Sounds like front page material.

You know, the funny thing?  This homemade video that had been sent specifically to Amy Klein, it's meant to look gritty and real, but the production values on it are at least as good as the larger movie within which it is shown.  It's like a little mini-Hellraiser film.  ""Look here!  It's a Cliff's Notes form of the plot you're about to watch.""

No.  I didn't give the movie away.  I hate it when people do that.  Suffice it to say that the movie gives itself away, especially after Amy discovers Pinhead's box and -- in a classic move -- does exactly what she's been warned not to do.  During her investigation, Amy runs into some kind of kingpin named Joey.  Whatever Joey is, he for some reason has commandeered and lives in the last car of a subway train.  When Amy visits him, it is a surreal scene of ambiguously disturbing acts of varying degrees of nudity.  It's so off-the-wall and well-spaced that it comes across like a museum of depravity, another cheesy room in your neighbor's haunted house.  Joey helps Amy because she's ""got that [ahem] self-destructive thing going on.""  Another good line (and in keeping with the Hellraiser spirit).  So good that it is repeated several more times.

But parroting a theme doesn't make it real.  And if the movie's other good line -- that we learn through fear -- is real, then this movie has two strikes against it, because it is neither scary nor smart.  It is actually very much like the video tape that gets Amy involved in this quest to begin with.  Both of them pack a bit of a punch in places, both of them are a little too slick to take seriously, and both of them are confusing and unsatisfying.  What are their differences?

2244798,5,B0007US7BC,"This was the seventh film of the ""Hellraiser"" series, and as such didn't attract much attention outside of the fan base. And apparently much of the base didn't like ""Deader"" anyway, leading to little serious critical appraisal. As a ""Hellraiser"" movie this is certainly even more experimental than the prior two were, and in my opinion, ""Deader"" is unquestionably the finest film of the series. Director Rick Bota, a talented cinematographer as well, invests a great deal of atmosphere into a creepy narrative involving an obsessive reporter, a cult of seemingly dead people, and of course the Lament box and Pinhead. What is all ready a great story is made much more impressive by the striking images that Bota and his crew sprinkle throughout, as well as some very committed performances. ""Deader"" is so much better than most other horror movies on so many different levels that it's very originality and tone can't be readily grasped by it's target audience. The viewers who would more likely find much to love about this film, the art-house types, will never see ""Deader"" because of horror's general reputation as well as, well, isn't this a ""Hellraiser"" sequel, after all? A death knell right there.
But to those who don't like this work as it features too little of Pinhead - watch ""Deader"" just as a movie first. The ""Hellraiser"" mythology works it's way in seamlessly, but it takes a little while to get there. Patience is more than rewarded.
As a ""Hellraiser"", maybe ""Deader"" is too cerebral, too subtle and too eccentric. But these very qualities make ""Deader"" a classic suspense-horror film on it's own, and I imagine the movie's standing will grow as time passes.",1194825600,3,1675,4.92226148409894
2244799,5,B0007US7BC,"I thought this movie was awesome for a straight to DVD movie.  Deader is somewhat low budget but is filmed in europe, so it looks much more authentic and a bit gothic.  Also this movie has somewhat of an artsy David Lynch vibe to it, and I really appreciated that.

The script is very good and engaging. The acting is mostly good. The plot is very interesting.  The blood, special effects, and gore scenes are mostly excellent.

This movie is about a journalist who investigates into a group called the deaders, run by an ancestor of the box maker, who made an appearance in the 4th Hellraiser movie.  As you watch the movie you will find out how pinhead and the cenobites are related to the deaders.

There is actually a bit of full frontal nudity and sexual scenes in this movie. So it is not for young teens.

Is this movie better than Hellworld? Yes! It is much better.  In fact this ranks as almost as good as the first two hellraisers.

2244801,3,B0007US7BC,"3.5 Stars. I don't think the writers/producers get this Hellraiser series. The entire idea of Hellraiser is to have Pinhead in the scenes because he is one of the scariest, most curious characters in horror. Again, he isn't shown enough. I want to see him lurking out of the darkness and showing up in flashbacks and threatening people.

The theme of the movie isn't bad: It's about a guy who can bring people back to life once they've been coaxed into killing themselves and he's been annointed by Pinhead to do this. All of these people are called ""Deaders"".

The strangest and most mysterious part(s) of the movie is when a journalist (Kari Wuhrer) checks all of this out and enters the subway and gets on a subway train which is a trashy hedonistic palace/chamber to get information from a fellow. The costumes and people on the subway are freaks and you can't take it all in because there's too much going on: there's sex and drugs and mutilation taking place among small groups of people.

Kari Wuhrer puts in a great performance I think, especially when she becomes one of the ""deaders"" and it freaks her out because she's bleeding everywhere she goes.

The climax always falls short in these Hellraiser movies for some reason. When Pinhead confronts Kari at the end she takes the box and says, ""Go to Hell!"" and throws the box. I still have no idea what this gesture means to Pinhead because it sends him into complete madness but it happens in every Hellraiser movie.(?) I mean all he has to do is walk over and pick it up!!! What's the big deal? My suggestion would be to end a Hellraiser movie differently by letting Pinhead torture someone physically or mentally for ten minutes or so and make the ending more complex.

2244802,3,B0007US7BC,"Ever since Hellraiser:Bloodline(4) all subsequent sequels have been direct to video. Why? well Hellraiser: Inferno, Hellraiser: Hellseeker, and this installment Hellraiser:Deader have used the same premise; screw with you head. In the first 4 films it was that when you solved the puzzle box you summoned Pinhead and crew, got hook chained back into hell. With the exception of a couple delusions/hallucinations that was basically it. In #5 on it changed you opened the box and you went on this mad journey through you own psychosis, almost like a dream where your mind is manufacturing things and at the same time Pinhead and the powers of hell are supplying their own special effects.  I'm not feeling all that.

  In Deader we have the lovely and talented Kari Wuher playing Amy Klien reporter for a paper called the London Underground. She gets an asignment to check out the Deaders after watching Deader front man ""Winter"" bring some chick back to life. Taking place in Romania Klein acquires the puzzle box and solves it, sending her on her own little psychotic journey into her own personal hell. As with #5 and 6 the big mystery for Klien is figuring out what the hell is going on, is she crazy or not and why does this Winter guy possess the ability he has to bring the dead back to life......whatever!  Trying to follow her mental break path to hell is a waste of time. Just let the movie unfold as it does and all--however thin will be revealed.  For Fans of Pinhead, yes Doug Bradley reprises his role as the brooding darkly poetic, and articulate Cenobite.  Pinheads presence in the first half of this 88 minute outing is nil.  The second half has a bit more but not much.

  Some of the effects in this film are I think not up to snuff, like the Cgi chains that pinhead uses. However Makeup jobs are cool, and there is a fair amount of blood being spilt. which make for some disturbing visuals,  I found myself saying; ""Dang, thats messed up!"" a few times in this Film. Overall for a direct to video sequel, Kari Wuher does a great job, and its always good to see Pinhead warp reality and twist words. For those reasons I went from 2 to 3 stars.

2244803,2,B0007US7BC,"Hellraiser: Deader is the eighth (or so) in the series kicked off by Clive Barker's cinematic magnum opus of gore: Hellraiser, which brought to eighties audiences the ultimate slasher villain: the immortal, vain and verbose Pinhead. This film, however, is far removed from the master's original vision of a pleasure-seekers' purgatory.

More importantly for fans, the series' Cenobites, grotesque, pleasure-and-pain-inflicting supernatural entities led by Pinhead, do not appear at all, except in the DVD extras, and the storyline itself was clearly intended to be a Pinhead-free affair. That is, until the Dimension straight-to-DVD department signed a cheque and made a sensible commercial decision to adapt the story for the Hellraiser canon.

I certainly am not one to be riled by capitalism and its inherent compromises, and this film unquestionably presents decent, low-grade genre fare, with an easily-digestable side of gore.

Our lead screamer, Kari Wuhrer, an exploitation-film actress who found fame on the syndicated Sliders TV show, is watchable, overcoming some dodgy dialogue and terrible costumes. Shot in Romania, no doubt for budgetary reasons, the film-makers manage to find several spooky locations and evoke a cool, wrong-side-of-the-iron-curtain creepiness throughout proceedings.

The plot is as follows: a star writer for a sleazy Fleet Street (London) tabloid begins to investigate a strange cult of young people in Bucharest, who appear to rise from the dead after having committed ritualistic suicide. Hellraising elements become merely an adjunct to our self-destructive heroine's temptation by, and ultimate victory over, these nasty young hedonists: the ""Deaders"".

Solid production values - considering what it is - and a moderately interesting underlying concept, see this film make the grade (just) as far as this horror fan is concerned. And, while reduced to side-show status, the Hellraiser cycle's iconic bad-guy does get to spout a few lines and chuck a few chains around, even if the lines are uninspired and the chains cheesy CGI.

Nonetheless, it really is hard to get past those shocking costumes the film-makers force our leading lady into. Beautiful as she is, Wuhrer is no teenager, and the character she is playing is portrayed as younger than she clearly is. But decking her out in boots and grunge jackets and tying her hair into goofy teen styles does not mask her age, it just looks ridiculous. And what single woman, travelling alone, wears a man's shirt (and no bra) to bed? Really, it was all highly alienating! Call me unreasonable or unfair, but I am rounding down the 2 stars just for that.

I cannot recommend you buy the DVD, but check out your local video library for some guilty, spooky pleasures, then make a decision as to whether you want Hellraiser: Deader in you collection.",1151712000,3,2838,5.279379157427938

The special effects are quite good but if one consdiers the budget then one has seen much worst. The acting is a but over the top but still good enough. Some of the scenes are quite demented and are on par with the earlier movies. This is the best in quite some time and gets 4 out of 5 stars.

2244807,3,B0007US7BC,"This film was one of the long awaited new Hellraiser sequels that collected dust while being kept unreleased more than a year thanks to people over at Dimension. The original script for this film was done by Neal Marshall Stevens. The original story had nothing to do with the Hellraiser mythology, but then Dimension decided that this should be a new Hellraiser sequel. So what they did was throw in familiar characters and made one of the characters a descendant of another previous character from the other films. I really don't want to stress how long I've waited for them to release this movie along with Hellworld (which were both filmed back to back). Today both films are now available on DVD and that was when I decided to check them out and still to this day I'm unsure as to if it was worth the long wait.

Hellraiser Deader is about a journalist named Amy who goes undercover to investigate a group called the Deaders. A small club of people who fallow their leader Winter, a man who bring back the dead. As Amy goes deeper in her search she is led to an apartment where she finds some papers and a mysterious puzzle box. Unaware of the box or what it contains she opens it up and finds herself in a hellistic situation where she has to make a choice. The first thing that I wanted to point out was that they could have easily made this film into something different. It know for a fact that this wasn't originally meant to be a new Hellraiser sequel but what I really didn't like was the fact that you can easily tell. It really felt like they took an original story and threw in familiar characters that we seem to love and can't get enough of.

To me everything just seemed added in at the last minute and I had a hard time believing that this was a new Hellraiser entry. I guess it's because I'm very familiar with the franchise and I've fallowed the story line. With Deader you get a different plot mixed with nightmarish scenes much like the previous entries Inferno and Hellseeker. Each new Hellraiser film is a mystery which blend in with graphic horror and a head scratching turn of events. This film is very different from the previous installments and I was glad that it didn't have the same twist or outcome as the last two films. This movie is more about a female journalist who is in the middle this battle between these two cult like groups. I thought that part of the plot was very interesting and the small bit in the ending was pretty impressive despite its poor CGI quality.

I had no problem with the films music or acting. I also did like seeing Kari Wuhrer in a starring role. Most of her work now is either direct to video or television releases but I thought she did a great job with her role in this film. Much like the other films Doug bradley steals the show once again, coming back to play the role of our beloved horror movie monster Pinhead. Along with the character Pinhead we are also treated to a revival of another old and familiar Cenobite which just made the film a little bit better for me being a fan of the series and all. Speaking of which if you do happen to be a fan and follower of these movies then I'm sure most of you will be disappointed with some of the Hellraiser gimmick and tricks that we've seen many times in the past. That pretty much matches what I said earlier about finding it hard to believe that this was a new ""Hellraiser"" entry. Everything just isn't the same but I can't complain about it.

Overall I thought Deader was a decent film. It's different from all the other movies but it just falls short with the intensity and low budget feel of the picture. It was nice to see some old faces again but it's nowhere near as magical or breathtaking as the older films. I did enjoy the acting, music and it's nightmarish feel. But for me it's the films plot, editing and all of the gimmick crashes that prevents me from giving this a higher rating. It had a lot of potential but for me it just doesn't work. If you're a fan of the series then you might deem this a worthy entry, but if you fallow with the story of the series carefully then you just might find yourself bored or unimpressed in the end.",1146268800,3,4170,4.356041131105399
2244808,3,B0007US7BC,"Hellraiser: Deader (Rick Bota, 2005)

A funny thing happened on the way to the review. I mentioned, offhand, that instead of watching the Academy Awards this year, travesty that they always are, I watched Hellraiser: Deader and Hellraiser: Hellworld, and would be reviewing them. I made a few vaguely positive comments. There was an immediate avalanche of debate about the relative merits of these two movies, far more so than there was about my various remarks disparaging the Oscars. Which leads one to think that perhaps one of the hallmarks of a movie's ""goodness,"" as it were, is how much debate is sparked over whether said movie is, in fact, good or not. And while I'm certainly not going to call Deader a timeless film classic, compared to some of the other recent Hellraiser-franchise movies, Deader actually has quite a bit going for it.

Plucky reporter (for they must always be plucky) Amy Klein (Sliders' Kari Wuhrer) uses the darknesses in her past to drive her life as an investigative reporter. When her boss gets a video in the mail that seems to show a woman committing suicide and being brought back to life, she's intrigued, and he's already got her booked on the next trip to Romania. She meets an odd band of characters there, but finds herself unable to uncover even the merest shred of truth...

The first thing you should know about Deader is that it's not a horror film at all; it's a mystery, and it's paced like one. It almost seems as if the Hellraiser aspects of the film (Pinhead makes a couple of cameos) were added as afterthoughts to an already-existing screenplay. Probably not the wisest decision; while tacking on the Hellraiser name was sure to get the film a distro deal, the movie has raised the ire of many devoted fans of the franchise. I can understand why; after all, as I said, this isn't a horror film. The gore, in most cases, is nothing you'd find outside a BBC mystery show, and the Hellraiser-esque footage (which may even be intercut from earlier films in the series) is generic. If you go into it looking for a Hellraiser experience, you are almost certain to be disappointed.

The second thing, and the most surprising, is that Kari Wuhrer, a name that has always been synonymous with ""bad actress,"" has actually matured quite a bit in her acting ability. She's still a long way from Oscar-quality, but it's at least no longer painful to watch her act while she still has clothing on.

A surprisingly good movie, as long as you're not expecting much. ** ",1142208000,3,2507,4.6863636363636365
2244809,2,B0007US7BC,"Just like the ""Changeling,"" I remember how much I loved the original ""Hellraiser"" when I was growing up. Along with its authenticity and intense gore, it had a killer plot that one rarely ever sees in horror films. Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" was originally not intended to be the progenitor of seven (or is it eight) cheap, slasher-based sequels. Not to say that I'm totally dissing the films, especially since they're much more intricate and well made than any ""Jason"" or ""I Still Know What You Did 'Two Summers Ago'"" sequels. Hellraiser itself was meant to be a human-based, psychological thriller where demons like Pinhead existed merely to shed light on the film's central theme- -the dangers of mankind's unchecked desires.

Hence, ""Deader"" comes out straight to DVD. Of course, no one expects too much from a straight to DVD/video release. However, ""Deader"" exhibits a great deal of potential that unfortunately is never realized. The first two-thirds of the film are very interesting...A bold, yet rather self-destructive reporter with a dark, hidden past is sent out to investigate a cult commonly referred to as the ""Deaders.""

Throughout the film, the only thing that is for certain about the cult is that its members are led to commit suicide, and are then inexplicably raised from the dead. Naturally, along with the mystery behind the Deader cult comes the interminable Pinhead and the famous puzzle box found in all the Hellraiser films. The box itself is known as the Lament Configuration.

Apparently, the creator of the original box (the box's origins/creator are revealed in ""Hellraiser 4: Bloodline"") is the great-grandfather of the leader of the Deader cult. So not only does he raise his followers from the dead, the cult leader basically lures them into opening the puzzle box and then brings them back. But then...it doesn't really make sense that a substantial mass of people can open the box and then go back to the real world without being tortured or even taken down to hell by Pinhead and the other Cenobites.

What's more, any lucid explanations pertaining to how the cult leader can bring his followers back from the dead are NEVER given. Despite a few cryptic hints, the film never explains why the cult leader really wants to kill people and bring them back, only to become a bunch of rotting, corpsy-looking sycophants. More importantly, the film doesn't give enough clues as to how the cult leader's plans coincide with hell, Pinhead, and the puzzle box.

All in all, this has the makings of a great horror film, yet the end sort of makes you feel like you've just sat through one big 90 minute tease. I give kudos to the guys who tried to make this low-budget sequel. After all, from what I hear the director (or whoever) may have simply run out of money to fully complete the film. But like most people, I don't really enjoy being teased. So in the end, I think ""Deader"" should just remain dead.",1141689600,6,2932,4.8326693227091635

However, they have destroyed the franchise and polluted the storyline. I should've known because it went straight to video, and that was clue number 1 that it would suck. We all know they make the movie sound so glamorous on the box, and when you take it home you see that it's trash. I guess I got what I expected from it, but it's still a disappointment.

2244812,3,B0007US7BC,"For those still counting, there are now 8 Hellraiser movies.  The first 4 made box-office appearances, with only the first two achieving a smidgeon of success.  The 4th Hellraiser movie, Kevin Yagher's overlooked ""Bloodline"", did so poorly at the box-office that from that point on subsequent sequels #5 and #6 were relegated to straight-to-DVD status.  As for entries #7(Deader)and #8(Hellworld) they didn't even make it that far, originally.  Apparently Dimension Films thought so little of them that they just sat on their shelves gathering dust for a couple years, un-released in any format whatsoever.  A company shake-up at Dimension now brings us these two new sequels to a franchise that was increasingly running out of ideas which each poor subsequent sequel.  Amazingly, Hellraiser: Deader is actually a pretty good entry and well worth a watch for the undiscriminating horror fan.

Amy Klein is an American journalist from NYC who has recently been re-assigned to London to work for the ""London Underground"" paper.  She's an expert of the urban underworlds, who secretly infiltrates and befriends the lost souls of crack houses, whore houses, S&M parlors and writes revealing exposes on them.  Her new assignment is most interesting: To go to Bucharest, Romania and infiltrate the secret society of the ""Deaders"", a strange cult that encourage suicidal and down-on-their-luck people to kill themselves.  The ""Deaders"" are then able to re-animate them and supposedly give them a new meaning to life.  With the help of some insiders, she gathers clues and eventually ends up opening the secret box, bringing back Pinhead and his Cenobites on this side of the world.  Pinhead and his minions of torture have a score to settle with the ""Deaders"" who are interfering with their universe and poor Amy now finds herself stuck in the middle of a very fierce battle...

""Hellraiser: Deader"" is a competently shot sequel that makes good use of sound, music and some oppressively gothic Bucharest locations.  Director Rick Bota throws us head-first into a dirty, sleazy underworld of junkies, crazies, fetish hounds and cult loonies.  I particularly liked the subway car that appears throughout the movie.  Now this is not your average subway car, bear in mind.  It is one where pain and flesh addicts are attached to its walls with chains, as fetish-fiends fornicate to the tune of loud heavy metal music.

As for our heroine, Amy is a chain-smoking, self-destructive and cynical girl whose miscues provide a few unintentional chuckles throughout.  For a journalist who is supposedly a seen-it-all veteran of underworld sleaze, she somehow freaks out at the sight of anything in the least bit disturbing.  Her deer caught in the headlights look was wearing thin on me after a while and it's not until right at the end that she finally develops a backbone to her.  Oh well, at least she's hot.

As one would expect, leaks in logic abound.  Why would a newspaper company send an American journalist like Amy on an undercover European assignment?  She obviously doesn't fit in, with her noticeable accent.  And how come everyone Amy comes across in Romania speaks perfectly fluent English?  They speak Romanian in Romania don't they?  But heck, minor squabbles these are.  What's a horror b-movie good for when you can't poke a little fun at plot holes?  As for ol' Pinhead and gang their appearances are very limited throughout.  I counted two 30-second appearances by Pinhead (played again by Doug Bradley) on his own and then there's a rather gory 5-minute sequence at the end with him and his cenobites.  I can't help but feel like this franchise has become one where the whole Hellraiser theme is simply a banner and image with the brilliant mythos that Clive Barker created being swept aside.  Still, that doesn't make ""Deader"" a bad film.  For most of the time, I forgot I was even watching a Hellraiser movie, rather I was engrossed with Amy's quest.  Despite its flaws and formulaic nature, ""Hellraiser: Deader"" is a fine addition to the Hellraiser cannon, one that should appease many fans and newcomers alike.",1134259200,4,4118,5.03397341211226

This movie is visually stunning- a true sensory masterpeice.

Kari is delightfully edgy and threadbaringly beautiful!! ( I adore Ms. Wuhrer!!)

 Deader is a movie that proves to be pleasingly Dark with just the right amount of mythological tantalization.

As for this movie, it's quite enjoyable considering it is the 7th in the series. There is some great gore, horror, characters, etc.

My only complaint is the plot. Well, to be exact, little is done to explain these ""Deader"" people and how they are connected to Pinhead. There are enough contextual clues that can help the viewer imagine for him/herself what is really going on, but i think most peopel who see a movie prefer a clear cut explanation.

Ultra hot Kari Wuhrer stars as a woman getting caught up in a plot about the Lament Configuration, and people calling themselves ""Deaders"".  The story is practically incomprehensible, and when the cenobites and Pinhead (Doug Bradley, once again) himself finally appear, they feel out of place and pasted on (they basically were, the screenplay was floating around and adapted into a Hellraiser film).  Considering the last two Hellraiser films, Inferno and Hellseeker, were departures from the series and took it into new and surprisingly good territory, Bota's directing is uninspired, and the film makes little to no sense.  Wuhrer is good and there's some nice gore, but other than that, Deader is a waste.

Still you keep on hoping...two movies ""Deader"" and ""Hellworld"" came out about the same time. I rented both of these movies and glad I did--only to find out if I purchased the $19.00 on either I would have been very angry--I would have felt extremely cheated. I definitely felt both were not good movies.

""Deader"" has a few good moments, but I'm not saying it's entirely bad...but not terribly good either. I would say it's

so-so. If you are a fan of Pinhead like I am, sure you will want to see it (only to be disappointed again). It's very much worth RENTING, but in my opinion not good enough to see twice.

Even the cenobites are cheaply manufactured. You see them in the end but they do....absolutely *nothing*...but stand there in cheap looking costumes. You don't even get chattering teeth! Oh...and don't expect to see pinhead much either. He only occupies about a few minutes of the entire movie :-(

Deader obviously cost the movie company money, but it makes you really wonder how on earth did they approve such a script with mediocre plot.

PARENTS-BEWARE! In addition to make up for such a mediocre plot they have a few skin flick scenes where lesbians are feeling off each others' boobs (naked) and putting their mouths on them too (well, that's what they are doing)--I thought it was totally unnecessary, and frankly it really made the movie much worst (I was going to give the movie a ""3"" but this downgraded it to a ""2""). It really is a very cheap--and boring--trick to allegedly hold your attention. BOTTOM LINE IF YOU HAD A GOOD STORY AND PLOT YOU WOULD NOT NEED THESE CHEAP PLOYS.

If you are a die-hard fan of Pinhead like me, you better rent this first before buying. If you plan to buy it first, well..I warned you. I would say it's worth about four dollars at best.

The Deaders have somehow impinged on the world of the Cenobites and Pinhead, and this illustrates their struggle, and only minimally does the role of Pinhead actually drive the narrative. Probably the most surprising character element is the identity  of the leader of the DEADERS... it is a male descendant of Le Marchant ( the maker of the original Puzzle box),
The film is a high toned horror film, with some great supernatural scenes, but the Pinhead components are almost an afterthought; but, as you will discover, the original script had some superb horror elements as sub-plots, and these were pared back so that the Hellraiser components could be forced in to the film. It is clear from Bota's comments in the making of featurette that budget drives  most of the changes.
The Disc extras are brilliant. Many extra features, 2  sets of commentaries, even a short ""gag"" reel, with some rather strange mistake moments by Doug Bradley. The FX guy does make the comment that the work in HELLWORLD, the next  film, is more ""Gnarly"" so, given that it seems that the FX guy is a bigger Hellraiser  fan than the director, I think we can expect some better Pinhead  elements... however, expecting one thing, and having it delivered are two different  events. Especially  since the Director Rick Bota, reveals in his commentary that after a 25 day shoot for DEADER, they began shooting HELLWORLD virtually immediately after they completed DEADER. Just how did the director see the DEADER  project through ?  If it is the DIMENSION execs are behind this, then someone should give them a wakeup call. I honestly hope that PINHEAD and the Cenobites, plus the superb FX of the first few films are present in HELLWORLD, but like a darn fool, I'll buy it mainly because of Doug Bradley's consistently good work.

This seventh installment honors that assessment, but the fact that it's different stems from the main plot not originally being based on the Hellraiser mythos.

Instead, a stand-alone horror story was written, and then Hellraiser was inserted in.

Unfortunately, this has left the Hellraiser connection making no sense whatsoever.

While the acting and cinematography are good, I can't really say the interest and enjoyment level matches.

Badly scripted, acted and under budgeted; the viewer doesn't need to be put through this type of hell.

Anyway, the acting and dialogue were pretty good in the movie and the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie was truly amazing! I loved the train-turned-club scene and Pinhead captivated me as always.

2244834,4,B0007US7BC,"The grittiest and bleakest of the ""Hellraiser"" saga - in everything from the kind of lighting used to the frequent usage of newspaper/'real-life' type horrors - drug addiction, decaying city slums, suicide, etc. - this is a new feel for the series, and it's a step back up from the good-but-not-great ""Hellseeker"", although not on level with any of the first five movies.

  A newspaper reporter (Kari Wuhrer) who specializes in reporting on - or sensationalizing, depending on your point of view - the above type of happening, receives a videotape purporting to show the suicide and apparant resurrection of a member of a cult called the 'Deaders' and is dispatched by her paper to Romania to investigate.  It feels kind of good to take the Hellraiser mythos to Romania, home of Transylvania and thus of Dracula and assorted other movie monsters; though one immediately noticeable flaw is how few people in the movie speak Romanian.  I know Europe has a higher multilingual rate than North America, but still...you hear maybe fifteen words of Romanian from bit players and everybody else uses fluent English exclusively. There are no horror movies that I know of filmed in this language and this would have been a great opportunity to give Romanian fans one that's about half in their language (with subtitles of course), half in English.  Anyway...

The mood gets darker and bleaker as things move into the rundown sections of Romania, not 'horror-dark' but 'mega-gloomy/nihilistic-dark' and it's a credit to the film's makers that it doesn't veer into the territory of being downright depressing, but avoids that trap and uses the bleakness to its advantage (I feel that 'bleak' is one of the hardest atmospheres to use effectively in a movie).  The Deader cult is in possession of one of the puzzle boxes, and a plus of the movie is that it actually touches on something mentioned in the very first movie that's never been followed up on until now.  The box can, most fans will probably remember, be manipulated into Configurations other than Lament, and can apparantly open doors to a number of realities, not all of them nearly so hellish as that which we've seen.  In the first movie Pinhead said that in some cultures they (the Cennobites) are perceived as angels, in other demons.  Okay, we've certainly seen the demonic side of things but precious little that anybody would think of as 'angelic'.  ""Hellraiser: Deader"" only runs along the surface of this new ground, but it is an opening.  This whole line of other realms/other perceptions is something I'd like to see explored further somewhere down the line.  If a user opens a different configuration, do the Cennobites emerge less hostile and 'nicer'?  Or are there cults or cultures out there that consider the Cennobites in the form we've seen them to be angels? (What the heck would their demons be like?!?) Are there configurations that will summon forth beings other than Cennobites?  If you watch the origin of the boxes in ""Bloodline"" the answer to that last one would seem to be no, but then again if you look at things from a different angle, perhaps it could be.  A passage was built that opens into, apparantly, Hell - could the passage also function - unintentionally? or as a defence backup? You have to watch ""Bloodline"" and decide for yourself I guess - as a door to and from other places (or times)? And you have to look at what the maker knew and what he didn't know about his assignment. There's a wealth of material here to explore if one chooses to take it up.

Which has little directly to do with ""Deader"", except to note that it's gotten the ball rolling in these new directions.  And while it's done it, it's offered some new ways to look at things (subjectively; it hinted at possible new interpretations without actually contradicting anything from before) and it's carved itself out a nice niche in the Hellraiser mythos as a distinctly grim, and very worthy, chapter in the series.",1120953600,28,3973,4.8161764705882355
2244835,3,B0007US7BC,"I loved the first three Hellraiser films. I thought the fourth one a noble effort, even though its outer space location sounded warning bells. The fifth and sixth entries, both of which took the series in a totally different direction, were quite good in my opinion. I liked the idea of a more personalized hell presided over by good old Pinhead. Obviously, many fans screamed bloody murder over what has happened to Clive Barker's original vision. They seek a return to earlier films, I guess, or at least a return to the days before Pinhead ambled out of the shadows spewing one-liners like some demented Dirty Harry. I'm sympathetic to their demands even as I recognize that those days are likely gone forever, or at least gone until Clive Barker decides to revitalize the series. Old Clive hasn't been involved in these films for years. Instead, the Weinstein Brothers over at Dimension films got their hands on the series, and whenever those two hacks set their sights on something you can bet a diminution of the source material will quickly follow. One thing they've got going for them, I must say, is the decision to let ""Hellraiser: Deader"" sit in the vault for a couple of years.

Why? Because this movie is the weakest of the lot, not only inferior to the originals but also inferior to the preceding two installments. If you need a touchstone for ""Deader,"" think of the personal hell theme found in parts five and six, but with even less Pinhead and the cenobites than found in those two films. In this outing, a reporter named Amy Klein (Kari Wuhrer) receives a most unusual assignment from her snooty British editor. The paper she works for, the London Underground, just acquired a most disturbing videotape. As snooty British editor and Amy watch in open mouthed shock, we see a group of grungy Eurotrash kids standing around in a grimy basement. One of the kids helps another kid lie down on a bed, puts a loaded pistol into her hands, and urges her to end her life. She does, and then comes back to life after the aforementioned kid gives her a couple of smooches on the lips. Hmmm. What's going on here? Euro-zombies on parade? Naw, it's just a cult known as the Deaders up to their old shenanigans again. Knowing that Amy can't turn down a juicy assignment, snooty editor sends her off to Romania in search of this dark cult. She's to report back with any relevant information.

Klein quickly locates the home of one of the cult members, bribes a greasy looking landlord into letting her into the apartment, and discovers that the girl is as dead as a doornail. She finds a videotape and a curious looking cube with ornate designs on it. Uh oh. Yep, it's the Lament configuration, and it's no time at all before Amy opens the box and receives a face full of chains as a reward. At this point ""Hellraiser: Deader"" descends into utter anarchy, much as parts five and six did after the main characters there opened the box. Klein starts experiencing incredibly freaky incidents, like seeing the leader of the cult jump in front of a moving train. She sees people sitting on benches bleeding, wakes up at odd times in entirely different locations, and runs into a cast of characters both weird and wacky. Amy is convinced that she's merely suffering through a very bad bout of dreams, but we know better. She did open that box, and she did unleash Pinhead and a couple of his cenobite cronies, but she's also caught up in some intricate conflict between the Underworld and the leader of the Deader cult. I won't say anymore--I don't won't to spoil a totally incomprehensible film for you--except to point out that ""Deader"" isn't very good or interesting.

In fact, Rick Bota's second Hellraiser film is actually quite boring. The pacing positively drags largely due to the head-scratching plot. Where's Amy going? Why is she going there? Who are these people she keeps running into? How did the Deader cult come to exist? These are questions without clear answers. But maybe Pinhead and the crew will come to the rescue! Nope, not really. We only see the man a couple of times in the course of the film and, what's worse, his lines are essentially the same dialogue we've heard in previous Hellraiser installments. He even says, ""I am the way"" more than once. Yawn. Well, maybe the gore will save the film! Don't bet on it. We don't see more than some heavy bleeding, pools of blood, and an exploding body at the conclusion of the film. I recall fondly the first time I saw ""Hellraiser II"" back in the day and being astounded at how many boundaries that film seemed to push. Those days are apparently over. ""Deader"" is a rather tame film less interested in pushing boundaries than in floating a series of confusing plotlines. Even the presence of the occasionally luminous Kari Wuhrer can't elevate the film above a mere average rating. She screams effectively, but seems to think smoking cigarettes and delivering lines with pseudo-attitude translate into an effective portrayal of a controversial journalist.

The most memorable thing I'll take away from ""Deader"" is the chuckle I got over that videotape of the cult. Apparently they captured the incident with more than one camera since we see professional grade editing throughout the presentation. Oh well, I shouldn't be too hard on this franchise. Most of the films in the Hellraiser series are interesting enough to watch. I do have hopes that ""Hellraiser: Hellworld,"" coming out on DVD in September, is a better entry than this one. I can hope, can't I?",1120867200,2,5527,4.724352331606218
2244836,1,B0007US7BC,"What was Rick Bota thinking?  After the awesome Hellseeker which redeemed my faith in the series we get this film which he didn't even bother to correct continuity errors that show he planned the reporters boss to be ""Pinhead"".

To make a long story short, this stands lower than even inferno.  No cenobites, no complex metaphor or additional information about the original story line.  Instead you get a generic cop story about a teenage cult of overly angst filled kids who are ticked at their parents.  This same kind of person might enjoy this film but others, die hards, people who liked the mystery and the lure of the metaphor and history of the box, will not enjoy this.

Hellraiser Hellworld was even better than this.  That film even with the generic story did have some strenght and didn't have continuity errors or plot screw ups.  If you change the story, reshoot relivant scenes.

Hellraiser Hellseeker made me think for a moment we might get back to the roots... here we are farther away than I would ever imagine.  Pinheads lines were even cheesey.  When Pinhead has a cheesey line, there's a problem.  He is the doom and dialogue of Hellraiser. Not to mention, the film doesn't stand on its own, if they were to rebrand this and call it something different,  it wouldn't have made a dime.  The story makes no sense and the plot is overly predictable.

At times the movie makes you forget you are watching a Hellraiser film. In many cases the scene is about to get good when all of a sudden it turns out to be a dream. Overall, an improvement from the last two but a dissappoinment from the original track of the film. I hope Hellworld brings some life back into these movies otherwise it will be the end of Hellraiser.",1119916800,4,1162,4.361111111111111
2244839,4,B0007US7BC,"How many series can boast of parts V, VI, and VII being its best?

It's funny that the first three bad to so-so films in the HELLRAISER series were given mass releases in the mainstream theatres, whereas, the best the series has to offer get stuck going ""straight to video,"" and dismissed as another cheesey sequal(s) by the majority of viewers.

The writers, along with director Rick Bota have really brought back the suspense and psychological terror that was originally intended when Clive Barker penned HELLBOUND HEART.

The last three Hellraiser films have actually contained strong performances by the protagonists and focus more on suspense, character development, psychological horror, the nature of good/evil, and depend less on fx and monsters (though DEADER contains some fantastic gore scenes toward the end!)

If you are one of those who felt the first few HELLRAISER films were lacking, then try either INFERNO, HELLSEEKER, or DEADER, you may be pleasantly surprised. This could appeal to fans of TWILIGHT ZONE.

Great extras on the DVD! The making of the special fx was interesting as was the gag reel!",1119830400,6,1117,5.081967213114754
2244840,5,B0007US7BC,"This is an awesome new HEllraiser sequal, in my opnion better than the previous two by far (i liked them to).  Plot twists, great story line, gore galore (of coarse it's hellraiser!) get this new kick ass sequal now! long live PINHEAD!",1119484800,4,235,4.595238095238095
2244841,1,B0007US7BC,"First of all, i have to say that i am a huge fan of the Hellraiser series. That is why i had high expectations about this new film. Most people didn't really like the last two ones ( Inferno and Hellseeker ) but i did ( especially Hellseeker ). I think Rick Bota did a great job, even though he turned away from the original movie ; but different doesn't mean bad. Anyway, i was very excited about watching Hellraiser Deader. Unfortunately, the disappointment was extreme. What were they thinking about ? Now fans have a Hellraiser movie they can really complain about. It is boring and grotesque. Pinhead and the cenobites don't have anything to do with the plot. Well, they actually try to make us believe otherwise. It did work pretty well in the previous movies. It definitely doesn't in this one. Now i have to admit that i'm a bit scared about Hellworld. I'll probably buy it because i own the whole series but i am very worried about the future of one of the best horror franchises.",1119484800,4,989,4.469613259668508
2244842,3,B0007US7BC,"After the last few horrible Hellraiser flicks, this one ups the ante just a bit.  The main gripe is still that Doug Bradley's awesome ""Pinhead"" is barely anywhere to be found.  I realize that it is prudent to keep him somewhat hidden to keep the suspense going but this is ridiculous.  The character makes about a 15 second appearance within the first 45 minutes of the film.  Then he comes on during the last few moments of the film along with 2 other underutilized cenebites.  Hey I'm as big a fan of Kari Wuher as the next guy but she can't hold up the entire picture by herself.  Plus she's either bloodsoaked or grunge infested for the entire picture which makes her appeal a bit diluted.  As with the last couple Hellraiser debacles, this one includes all the same dreaded ""quick cut scare effects segueing to the inevitable wake up & it was all a dream"" sequences.  Can't anyone come up with something original on this front?  On the positive side of things, the cinemetography is nice (Budapest makes for a haunting backdrop), the music while not up to Chris Young's caliber of the first 2 entries of the series is passable, and the general atmosphere of dread is well utilized despite the low budget.  I look forward to the next entry ""Hellworld"" as I do every release in this series.  Here's to hoping we continue the upward trend towards a more interesting ""Hellraiser"".  I think it's about time they just let Doug Bradley write & direct one.  He's certainly intelligent enough to come up with the goods (I met him at a Chiller Convention & he's a great guy).  Either that or BEG Clive Barker to throw in his 2 cents again before the inevitable ""hollywood treatment"" of Pinhead VS Michael Meyers.  We just have to keep the faith that this series will get back on track for at least one more grand epic!",1119139200,4,1813,4.535384615384616
2244843,1,B0007US7BC,"By far, one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. It starts off promisingly enough with some interesting story points and editing, but soon deteriorates. Some of the makeup is good, but pinhead and all of the other cenobites don't make an apearance until the end! When they do, it feels tacked on and does not connect with what has happened up til that point. Although, what has happened is a quandry. The story derails after the first 30 mins. and after that all you get is boobs and blood with no pupose. The ending scene is a direct rip of ""Jesus wept"" from the original Hellraiser, but done poorly. Clive Barker is certainly in hiding after the release of this piece of repetitive trash.",1119052800,4,698,4.503937007874016
2244844,4,B0007US7BC,"Well finally ""Hellraiser: Deader"" has arrived after a few years gathering dust on the shelf. I agree with other members that it does seem to breathe some life in to this once outstanding franchise, but as with the other sequels it just lacks what the earlier films had in abundance. My personal view is that you can really tell that this wasn't written as a ""Hellraiser"" film. For the first half hour or so except with the odd reference to ""The Box"" this could have been any other horror film and it kind of remains that way throughout. The one thing really missing for me as with ""Hellraiser: Inferno"" and ""Hellraiser: Hellseaker"" is we just don't see enough of the ""Cenobites"". I don't just mean ""Pinhead"" I mean all of them. You see a few glancing shots of them, but I'm sorry its just not enough. To be fair ""Pinhead"" did seem to play a bigger part in this than Parts V or VI, however he has almost become a extra these days. I have read a few comments from other users saying that these films are not about ""Pinhead"" but there is a reason he has been in all of the franchise to date. I agree that one of the strengths of ""Hellraiser"" is they are stand alone stories, but in any franchise you need a recurring factor and the ""Cenobites"" and in particular ""Pinhead"" is it. The ""Cenobites"" are ""Hellraiser"", which is why the later films don't feel like ""Hellraiser"" movies at all. ""Hellraiser: Deader"" is a good and one of the better sequels to date and should give all fans hope for ""Hellraiser: Hellworld"" but as I remarked with ""Hellraiser: Hellseaker"" the fleeting glimpses of the ""Cenobites"" just are not enough. Get back to the essence of the movies and set the story around them or let them play a major part again. The later films in this series sadly, could have been so much more.",1119052800,3,1792,4.449848024316109
2244845,3,B0007US7BC,"If you're a fan then you're probably going to buy this 7th installment of the Hellraiser series anyway...But lemme give you some advice on buying it first: Blockbuster, WestCoast video or Best Buy all do not carry it unless you special order. It's 30 bucks at Suncoast, 22.99 at Circuit City and about the same here at Amazon excluding the shipping. I do not know why this movie and the previous one, Hellraiser Hellseeker are so expensive when they give you barely any special features. It is not a bad movie by any means, just a little pricey for what you get. You see Pinhead for the first time around 20 minutes then again later on. Also, the hellraiser series isn't known for humor so i don't know why they put this character joey in, he really sucks and ruins the darkness the movie had going for it as they try to make him the comedic relief or something. If you liked the last three sequels, go for it. If you're just getting into horror or the hellraiser movies, get the first three.",1118880000,4,992,4.426229508196721
2244846,1,B0007US7BC,"Once again they have tried to create some sort of psychological thriller using the hellraiser name. Parts 1 through 4 were the only true hellraisers and even 4 teders on the edge. Just like parts 5 and 6, this one have about 2 minutes of pinhead and in exactly the same format. He appears to say one line after about the first half hour, and then again at the end of the film to spout some dark poem about flesh and taking someone back with him, and ends with a loud NOOOOOOOOO when the ""hero"" stops him. Chatterer is in this one like the previous volume for 2 seconds and does nothing, just stands in the background. I cant figure out whay Dimension films keeps producing these sad entries in the series. Whay don't they just make a good one with the origional 4 cenobites and a real story! Avoid this pathetic entry in the series, it gives pinhead a bad name for sure. Oh, one last thought,. they seem to have changed pinheads cassock again into some rubber thing with a thick collar, you can tell hes standing in a molded costume unlike the first 4 when he actuallly moved around a bit.

2244848,4,B0007US7BC,"I will start with this overview of Hellraiser 7:Deader with this: It STILL isn't the time to ignore the franchise. While I won't waste space here to tell you the storyline of this chapter (Amazon reviewer ""Juscelino Liberato De Aquino"" has done that just fine earlier here), I will say this, this movie shows Pinhead actually being a needed part of this film. Y'see, ever since Hellraiser 5:Inferno, ole Pinhead has been reduced to a side player, basically showing up at the end to collect his check. Not that he doesn't do that as well in this, the seventh in the series, but at least he seems to have a good enough reason to, which is strange since that this film was originally written as ""Deaders"", a stand alone film that never was going to get made until it was merged with some Hellraiser writing to make it part of the film series. The result is a great, gory, horror film that's in touch with the original Clive Barker classics, as if he made it himself.

Now I'm sort of biased in this movie since I own & enjoy all the films in the series (and plan to buy Hellraiser 8:Hellworld when it comes out in September of '05), but this one actually proved to me that there's still some legitmate life left in the series. Where as Parts 5 and Part 6:Hellseeker were entertaining, but they constantly reminded me of pilots for ""Hellraiser:The Television Series"", and no one really wants that! This one truly has a classic 80's horror vibe, with a scary script that works and plenty of non-airable on the public airwaves graphic footage. This one should bring the people that left the franchise back, after leaving probably around maybe Part 4:Bloodline.

Oh, and one final thing, as a horror movie fan who enjoyed them through the late 80's, and then suffered through all the bad ones of the 90's, and now almost skip any original one made now (should horror ever, and I mean ever, be rated PG-13?), this one gave me hope that a good one can still be made in this day & age. While this isn't the best of the series, it ranks up there after say Part 3:Hell On Earth (which remarkably STILL isn't availible on American DVD after all this time, probably because of all the music right issues). So follow Pinhead again and remember that ""He Is The Way!""",1118534400,6,2250,4.49877750611247

And like most of these said scripts that Dimension Films seem to have laying around - it's a complete turkey. Terrible writing with bland archetypes and situations that wouldn't make sense even in the worse fever dream.

Doug Bradley (like a real trooper), is great to watch as Pinhead. But there is so little of him to make this film worth watching. The protagonist (this time an American reporter on a story for an edgy UK newspaper) is at least a sympathetic one and the acting here is better than previous installments. Though this makes it harder to watch Wuhrer being tortured for the longest 88 minutes you'll ever sit through.
