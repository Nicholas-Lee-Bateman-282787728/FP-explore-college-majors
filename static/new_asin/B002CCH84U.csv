All the main characters are played by new faces, with the exception of the villain Csar Luis, played by Alexis Ayala, who does a bang-up job as both a dastardly businessman and his twin.

Our eponymous Juan, played by Eduardo Santamarina, is our hero, although he is such a blow-hard egoist it was hard for me to root for him. On the other hand, the bone of those guys' contention, Paula, played by Mayrin Villanueva, is a new face and a charming actress.

The villain has three women in his stable: his wife, his mistress, and his next conquest. Even as he is vowing undying love for the conquest, whom he marries eventually, he has others on call. Juan is head over heels for her but is constantly ogling pretty women on the street and in the office. He starts out as the driver for the woman he adores, but ends up owning the company.

It's clear that the writers and performers have never worked in a business environment, jobs and promotions are handed out with blithe disregard for reality. Oh well, this wasn't good enough to get invested in any of the plot. Not recommended....",1407542400,,1149,4.531400966183575

3 star review.  This version of this soap opera seems to be a condensed version.  It seems they took out scenes from the version there showing on tv right now.  The reason I know is because I taped a show from the tv version and compared it to the copy version I have.  That is how i found out that this version is missing scenes and is probably a condensed version.  Everything else on the DVD I like.",1395100800,,436,4.070588235294117
