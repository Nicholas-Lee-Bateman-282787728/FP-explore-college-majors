8373061,4,B002LGIDAK,"This features a guy who takes off on a forty day vacation to the Holy Land with the goal of participating in a variety of fasts while touring the Holy Land. The places he visits are interesting as he shares their significance and Bible reference if there is one. Meanwhile, he is less than honest about telling his guide that he is fasting, then he occasionally resorts to trespassing to visit some sites. His guide eventually bails out of fear, or maybe the $ he paid had run out. Unknown. Insightful.

Reviewer's Note: I have fasted for a day, no fun! I think it is self mutilation. What is the point! To bargain  with God to listen to your request? UGG!",1517443200,,656,4.413223140495868

8373064,1,B002LGIDAK,"My Christian club students and I were greatly disturbed to watch Mr. Trones break the laws of his host country at every turn, justifying left and right. This is a horrible message for Christians of all ages.  The local guide accompanying Mr. Trones even quit over this issue.  For shame! It overshadowed all other messages in the video. :-(",1337731200,2,340,4.745762711864407
8373065,4,B002LGIDAK,"The Road Less Traveled is certainly a film that I will enjoy for years to come.  The host is a young, energetic explorer who seems very knowledgeable about the sites and the history of Christianity and Judaism.
There were so many holy sites in this film that I will have to watch it repeatedly just to take them all in.  I wish a little more time were spent at some of these amazing places, but I always got to see & understand each artifact, tomb, shrine, etc. and I definitely feel that I got my money's worth.  In addition, the film includes scriptural and biblical references at every site, so this has become in incredible study guide for me.  It has truly made my bible study come to life.
Most of the sites shown in this movie I have never seen before and are definitely not shown in any other Holy Land films and videos.  The film captures their beauty and mystique in great quality.  Brandon (the host) got right up close to every site and made me feel like I was right there with him.
Brandon also incorporates elements of fasting into the film, which makes the story much more interesting and keeps this from becoming a simple travel show.  I learned about the different kinds of fasting without feeling preached to, which was nice.  They also incorporate animation and fun graphics, which gave the film a lot of production value and made it fun for my whole family to watch.
I read another review that didn't think the film had enough danger, but that simply isn't true.  During the movie, Brandon repeatedly films in Palestine and the wilderness where no one has before, accesses ""off limits"" areas, enters guarded mosques, climbs fences, crawls through tunnels, and even walks along a mine field...if that's not dangerous, I don't know what is.
I may never get to the Holy Land, but this film makes me feel like I have already been. I will continue to enjoy it and use it with my studies.",1268784000,3,1902,4.521865889212828
8373066,3,B002LGIDAK,"Israel, the holy land for all of the world's mainstream monotheistic religions, is a major center for pilgrimage and sightseeing. However, it's doubtful that I'll ever personally visit the geographical birthplace of my Christian faith. As a result, I have a keen interest in films and books that seek to take readers to biblical sites, while offering educational and spiritual insight.

In a personal journey to uncover some of these treasures for himself, Brandon Trones set out for the holy land, planning a series of four 10-day fasts of various types (water only, bread only, fruit and vegetables only, liquids only) while he seeks to capture rarely filmed sites of biblical repute. Billed as something of a voyage that takes you to forbidden, secretive, or closed locations, Trones offers a lightning speed tour through both the well known tourist locales and those off the beaten track.

Trones covers a great amount of ground over his 40-day journey, but each site is covered in such a compressed amount of time (most often less than one minute, with around four minutes maximum) that it was difficult to take away any real feeling of educational value or spiritual depth. The pace is so rapid that the journey seems disjointed and often choppy, leaving viewers without a sense of purpose, plan, or cohesion. His `dangerous' exploits amount to filming in tourist locations where recording devices are forbidden, jumping over a closed fence, and sneaking into a cave section that is off limits. Personally, I found these exploits somewhat tame and less than the life-threatening adventures Trones would have us believe they are.

At least as much time is dedicated to the challenges experienced by Trones as he fasts - his weekly weigh-ins, his struggles, and the delight of the solid meals he experiences when he switches to the Daniel fast. I wasn't expecting so much emphasis on the fasting aspects, which lend themselves more to a Super Size Me documentary-style film, and served more to take valuable time away from exploring the target destinations in my mind.

Trones largely fails to incorporate biblical references and proof texts for the sites he visits, instead relying mainly on hearsay and tradition. He visits churches that supposedly contain the bones of saints, works his way through the Catholic (at times extra-biblical) stations of the cross while lugging a wooden one on his shoulders, and is often heard saying, ""This is where they say [insert event that may or may not be recorded in the Bible] occurred."" Personally, I was looking for more proof of authentication, and more historical detail than Trones provided.

Providing all of the commentary himself without the aid of a narrator actually works to the film's detriment. At times Trones' comments are somewhat rude, and downright inaccurate. For example, in his commentary on the Church at Cana he claims that Jesus turned water into a whole lot of ""hooch,"" and makes comments about how many people would be able to get drunk on that. Jesus actually turned water to wine (which was commonly consumed), and since Christians are advised not to be drunk in the New Testament, I don't believe that was His intent. Comments such as these left me wondering if Trones was a believer in the earlier portions of the film.

For what was obviously produced on a slender budget (a few plane tickets to Israel, some equipment, and travel expenses), the production values are very respectable. Blending Indiana Jones-style design with cartoon introductions and transitions reminiscent of Monty Python, the film has a lot of visual appeal. Standard scene selection is provided, along with 15 production stills and 12 ""Lost Sites"" that weren't included in the main film (from the cutting room floor) as bonus features.

Overall, I was left with the impression that The Road Less Traveled is more about a young man's personal travelogue than it is about any deep historical or spiritual exploration. Most of my mental visual images from the film involve Trones scrambling around tourist sites and caves exclaiming, ""Wow, isn't this neat?"" which is fine in and of itself. I was just expecting more.",1267056000,4,4163,5.033381712626996
8373067,5,B002LGIDAK,"I really didn't know what to expect when I popped in ""The Road less traveled: Hunger for the Holy Land"". I thought it might be just another one of those ultra PC christian documentaries. As I was watching, I have to admit that I became glued to my seat as the whole crew (with the exception of Brandon, his guide, and the cameraman) leaves Israel to  go back to America. That's when the party really gets started! From that point foward you get the sense that Brandon could get captured or killed by Palestinians... all while at the same time he is partaking in this absolutely grueling 40 day fast. Definitely not your typical Christian documentary! You get kind of an uneasy feeling as you watch him go from site to site dodging the REAL dangers that he does. I will say that Brandon does a good job of calming you down with some hilarious humor breaks though. The interactions with Brandon and his un-easy Israeli guide are especially funny.
  Overall, the movie is a visual masterpiece. Whoever that cameraman was deserves an oscar. The movie also has a suspense curve to it that keeps the movie exciting from start to finish. Brandon carries himself very well throughout the film and shows characteristics of an inspired leader with a charismatic appeal. I would definitely recommend this movie to a friend.",1256169600,5,1312,4.695652173913044
8373068,5,B002LGIDAK,"Best Holy Land documentary I've seen. Seen just about all of them. This documentary plays out like an episode of Man vs. Wild starring a guy who has gone all out to feed his hunger to see and walk the places of most relevance from Biblical times. When I say ""feed his hunger"" please understand how figurative that statement is. This guy (Biblical Documentarian Brandon Trones) actually fasts for 40 days during the entirety of the filming. You'll see him famished, exhausted, and threatened by authorities in the Holy Land region where the entire film takes place. With actual footage of places never before seen on film I was shocked to know that some of the ancient Bilical Landmarks I have read about are still there today in 2009! Places like the Upper Room where the Last Supper took place, John the Baptist's cave in ""the wilderness"" and all kinds of other amazing locales. If you're like me and get glued to the t.v. when the History Channel plays the ancient or Biblical programs, you'll LOVE this Film. Or if you're a Theologian, student of the Faith, or just have a Bible Study at Church or something going on, I highly recommend this film. Enlightening, Educational, Spirited, Inspiring, and even NAIL BITING. I've always wanted to go to the Holy Land, but Mr. Trones has brought the Holy Land to me!.......at least for now anyway.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Geographic-Secrets-of-Jerusalem-s-Holiest-Sites/dp/B000KJU1EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Geographic - Secrets of Jerusalem's Holiest Sites</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5000-Years-of-Magnificent-Wonders-Secrets-of-the-Holy-Land/dp/B000FS2W9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5000 Years of Magnificent Wonders: Secrets of the Holy Land</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-Jesus-Walked/dp/B0000CBXYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where Jesus Walked</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ-Definitive-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B001JNNDGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Holy-Land-Revealed/dp/B00013WWPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Holy Land Revealed</a>",1255996800,6,2341,7.424460431654676
8373069,5,B002LGIDAK,"I just finished watching ""The Road Less Traveled: Hunger for the Holy Land"" and all I can say is WOW!  This is not your standard religious or historical documentary with still images and droning commentary.  This film is an adventure from start to finish!  You feel as though you are traveling right along with Brandon seeing places and artifacts you may never otherwise see.  Without giving too much away, some of my favorite spots in the film were En Gedi (David's hiding place King Saul), the Tomb of Lazarus, and the prisons where Jesus was held captive.  The footage is absolutely powerful and moving.

I highly recommend this film.  It's interesting for all ages.  Brandon is smart and funny, and you really feel like you are watching a friend. It would also be a great tool for parents to discuss religion, history, and world relations with their kids.",1251849600,2,859,4.756756756756757
