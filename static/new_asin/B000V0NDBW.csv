Its New Years Eve and things just go unpredictably wrong in this italian commedia film. The film jumps around alot to different people and events going on, but in each storyline things are so funny.  Monica's role is that of a wife having a dinner party with her husband and friends for the evening.  She has maybe a 20% part in this film.  If you love Monica, you'll love this film.  If you like Monica, then you like this film.  If you buying it just to see young Monica naked, then if $25+ dollars for 3 minutes, go ahead.  If you just starting looking into Monica's career, get movies where she has a main role, and save this one till you have a few of her main titles.",1197331200,5,798,4.308724832214765
