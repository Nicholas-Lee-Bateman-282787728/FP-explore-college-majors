4498489,4,B004XZ99ZU,"MPI jumps on the bandwagon with a series of ""Best of..."" compilation releases, drawn from some of their popular TV show titles.  This HERE'S LUCY disc is nicely priced for people who'd like a small sampling of the show before they commit themselves to buying the full season sets...but seriously...who doesn't already love Lucy?!

To date, MPI has released seasons 1-4 of HERE'S LUCY.  The episodes included here are:

* ""Lucy and the Great Airport Chase""
* ""Lucy Meets the Burtons""
* ""Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage""
* ""Lucy Goes on Her Last Blind Date""
* ""Lucy and Joan Rivers Do Jury Duty""
* ""Lucy is NG As An RN""
* ""Lucy and Joe Namath""

Buyers who've already purchased the full seasons probably won't bother with this disc; though it'll do well for casual collectors, and as a cheap Christmas stocking-stuffer.  MPI seems committed to eventually releasing the complete series of HERE'S LUCY, so let's support this label and their outstanding efforts in keeping these vintage shows alive.",1304467200,8,994,4.85207100591716

8447675,4,B004XZ99ZU,"The collection is pretty standard fare for its day. It's a good show to watch especially on cold, dreary days. We don't have cable or satellite installed at our country cabin so this is good enough.
Lucy was one special lady -- funny and brilliant at her craft. However, The Lucy Show collection is much better. Her dialog with Mr. Mooney is very memorable and always funny. Buy the second season. The Mr. Mooney character shows up here.",1389052800,,437,4.615384615384615
8447676,5,B004XZ99ZU,This 'Best of Collection: Here's Lucy' is so good as it is every thing that I was hoping for! It really reminds of when I was a child & seeing these shows on television!,1366329600,,169,4.0
8447677,5,B004XZ99ZU,I am a very big Lucy fan. Gale Gordon was funny on I love Lucy. Now he is Lucy's boss. Just would not be Lucy if Lucy did not get into messes. Lucy makes me laugh.,1354924800,,163,3.5555555555555554

8447680,5,B004XZ99ZU,"While some Here's Lucy eposides are not up to par the series overall is enjoyable.  It is nice to see these seven shows released because these are fan favorites and reflect some of Lucy's last best work.

""Lucy & The Great Airport Chase"" is a hilarious chase show with lots of side splitting comedy and marks the first time forever the show was filmed on location outside the studio.

""Lucy Meets The Burtons"" shows how Richard and Liz could be hilarious and they work well off of Lucy.  She is just hilarious with the stuck ring.

""Lucy & Mannix Are Held Hostage"" is just great.  Lucy and Mannix tied together and trying to escape the criminals is hilarious.

Lucy is N.G. as R.N. is an ensemble show that is hilarious as Lucy needs to help everyone who is having accidents all around her.  The supporting cast in this eposide, Mary Jane, Lucie, and Gale, help counterbalance Lucy's comedy to make it a comedy gem.

""Lucy & Joe Namath"" is a great family show and you can sense here the love Lucy, Lucie and Desi have for eachother.  It is based on a realistic situation with charcter warmth, which is what made I Love Lucy superior sometimes to her other shows.",1305244800,2,1162,4.4904761904761905
8447681,5,B004XZ99ZU,"This DVD is great for people who can't afford to buy season sets or who may be not have seen ""Here's Lucy"" when is was first aired.  All I can say is that all seven episodes are great.",1304985600,,184,3.8421052631578947
