8447032,5,B004XKIOJM,"I absolutely love it! A great accompaniment to the K-ON TV series. Unfortunately there are no English subtitles at all! There is a section in the concert where the voice actors do a table read of one of the scripts for the show, but unless you know Japanese, the whole thing is lost! The only disappointment in an otherwise wonderful Blu-ray!",1448496000,,342,4.622950819672131
8447033,5,B004XKIOJM,"This is a live concert the voice actresses from the anime put on for the fans. Each actress plays their respective instrument from the series, like Yui plays the guitar, Mugi plays the piano/organ and so on. This concert came out in 2011 but I only found out about it recently on Youtube. The concert is a collection of songs from Season 1 and 2, including the opening and closing songs plus the songs from their concerts in the anime. The only difference is that these songs are the long versions, like you would find on a CD. I first saw a few clips from the concert on Youtube and loved them. The actresses do such a good job at making each song sound almost exactly or even better like it would on the anime. Each actress learned how to play their own instrument and how to play each song. I believe there are about fourteen songs that they play as a band plus several others that each actress does on their own. Also included is a couple of songs from Death Devil. If you are a fan of the anime I would recommend this, even though it has been four years since it came out it still is cool to watch.",1448323200,3,1103,4.2075471698113205
