Be sure to checkout Groundhog Day the musical and everything else he does.
Truly uproarious.",1517616000,,159,5.153846153846154
8555423,5,B00AON2S9O,"Amazing, brilliant, and one of the best performers I have ever watched. Love this!",1512518400,,82,4.928571428571429
8555424,5,B00AON2S9O,"I've been a big fan of Tim Minchin for many years and often sing the title song to get myself going in the morning. His is a unique brand of humor examining our human foibles, from the personal to the global geo-political stage. Minchin's use of language is magnificent; his comic style his uniquely his own, his mastery of the piano is remarkable, and he possesses a sense of impeccable timing in all things. Not for the overtly religious, the demure, or others easily offended. Otherwise, just watch it.

Thank you Amazon for this offering.",1510790400,,542,4.705263157894737

8555426,4,B00AON2S9O,"Tim Minchin is the mental love child of Eddie Izzard and Tom Lehrer. His acerbic wit, cunning wordplay and clever musical arrangements keep you focused and engaged every moment.

This disc could be a good intro to a Minchin novice. I started with his Albert Hall Symphonic concert (incredibly amazing) so this was different. Nowhere near the same production values, but very good none the less. There are a couple songs here that were done in the big concert one, but here you get a chance to hear the lyrics better because it's just him and a piano (and occasionally a backing track).",1414627200,,585,4.679611650485437
