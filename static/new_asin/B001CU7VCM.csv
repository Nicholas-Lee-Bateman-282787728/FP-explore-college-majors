8425321,1,B001CU7VCM,"I was disappointed to discover that the DVD shipped had nothing to do with Iwo Jima, although it was indeed inside the ""Pacific:  The Lost Iwo Jima"" slipcase.  Instead, the DVD was a History Channel documentary about famous villains in television and film.  I first watched the DVD after the end of the Amazon return period, so unfortunately lost my money.
So, I advise you to view this video immediately upon receipt so you may return it to Amazon for a partial refund -- in case you also receive a mis-packaged DVD.  Or perhaps it is best to avoid taking the risk of ordering it at all.",1249862400,,588,4.4672897196261685
