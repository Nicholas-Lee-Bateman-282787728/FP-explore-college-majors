7683099,5,B01CH6SA7E,"My friends and I saw this at universal city walk and had the BEST time.  This was the rare horror comedy that was both a good horror flick and managed to be funny without being clueless and solely referential to pop culture.  The acting was solid.  I actually cared about what happened to the characters - which you never really do in most horror movies, let's be honest... Maybe Drew Barrymore in the original Scream because - come on - all that chick was doing was trying to make some popcorn and maybe the wheelchair guy in the original chainsaw massacre because he just couldn't help being a self absorbed idiot and didn't see it coming, but you'll genuinely find yourself cheering for the bumblebee chick in this movie.  The lighting and camerawork was also pretty impressive.  Big ups to the crew who made this film.  Buy it! You won't regret having this on hand the next time your buddy shows up at your house with a bottle of straight bourbon and a pizza saying ""what are we going to watch tonight?""",1463961600,5,1007,4.5054945054945055

7683112,5,B01CH6SA7E,"I had more fun watching this movie than I've had since the early 1990's when I saw Tremors for the first time; like Tremors, there is a wonderful mix of humor and horror in this movie. It's also an outstanding plot: create a Halloween ""funhouse"" based on the escapades and adventures of five different psychopathic killers. No spoilers; I won't go any farther than that. But if you like some splatter with a pinch of humor, this movie is well worth watching. And I loved the casting of Robert Englund as the asylum's warden. For those of us who love the Freddy Kruger character, it's cool to see him as a (sort of) good guy.",1494374400,4,624,4.434782608695652
7683113,5,B01CH6SA7E,"It's hard to review a movie without giving away the plot or the shock surprises and spoiling it for other people.  So many horror movies are variations on the same tried and true plots.  These movies rely on gore,  nudity or a convoluted backstory to carry them.  Funhouse Massacre is a fun ride with a fresh take on things.  The plot involves a group of escapees from a Supermax asylum for the criminally insane and their takeover of a newly opened funhouse of horror to wreak their revenge on an unsuspecting public.  The gore is there,  but barely any nudity,  despite the horny young couple screwing at every opportunity.  Each psycho gets his/her turn at bat, and at first the attendees assume that it's all part of the show.  Playing against Team Psycho is a group of archetypal horror movie victims,  the horny couple,  the 2 shy not quite a couple kids,  2 geeks and the bored fringe guy who would rather be someplace else.  There is a little bit of a back story thread running through it,  tying together a few of the characters,  but it's not enough to distract from the fun.
Robert Englund makes what I consider to be a cameo as the warden of the asylum,  and fans of NCIS will be pleased to see Scottie Thompson  [Agent DiNozzo's undercover love interest,  Jeanne Benoit],  in the role of Sheriff Kate.  Candice De Visser plays the character  Dollface/Ms Quinn with great panache.",1490832000,2,1392,4.595918367346939

7683123,3,B01CH6SA7E,"I did some research and eventually handpicked this for a Halloween party based upon the reviews at Amazon and elsewhere.  I'm a big fan of all types of horror movies and so it did not bother me that this was a slightly comedic B-horror movie, as I have enjoyed many similar films in the past.  My problem with this film is that its just doesn't do anything to make it exceptional.  It is kind of funny, kind of gory, not very scary, and just generally lacks one defining thing to really make it stand out.  Definitely not a bad film, there were still a number  of laughs and groans from our crowd, I just had higher expectations based upon the acclaim this had received elsewhere.",1477958400,,680,4.408
7683124,4,B01CH6SA7E,"Everyone knows I love horror films that take place in amusement parks or contains clowns. THE FUNHOUSE MASSACRE (2015) contains both. The film opens on Halloween Night, with reporter Ms. Eileen Quinn (Candice De Visser) threatening to expose the prison in the middle of town that is being kept secret from the surrounding residents unless the Warden (Robert Englund, doing his usual 5 minute cameo) takes her on a tour of it. The Warden tells her that even though Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy and other famous serial killers have received all the Press, his prison holds some of the worst serial killers today, even if they are not well known (He whispers to Eileen, ""There are people in here that God is even afraid of!""). He shows them to Eileen and they include Animal The Cannibal (E.E. Bell), whose crimes are self-explanatory; The Taxidermist (Clint Howard), who likes to create new human bodies by putting different sawdust-filled body parts together; Rocco The Brute (Mars Crain), who has killed all his opponents in the wrestling ring and later rips the face off a clown and wears his face!; Dr. Suave (Sebastian Siegel), who likes to remove teeth without the use of Novocaine; and the worst of them all, ""Mental Manny"" (Jere Burns), who once was the leader of a cult and set a girl on fire. Eileen follows the Warden to his office and garrotes the Warden so bad his head nearly come off and then kills a guard by stabbing him in the balls and then his back, stealing his gun. She then goes to the Control Room and kills the operator. She shoots him in the heart and beats his head in with her special walking stick and sets all the serial killers free. It turns out she is ""Dollface"", the daughter of Mental Manny, who is now the leader of all the serial killers. Dollface has set up the the local amusement park, The Land Of Illusion, with a special attraction called ""The Funhouse"" for Halloween, so that every room replicates the escaped serial killers' crimes and they first kill the Funhouse's director Dennis (Courtney Gains), but the one-dimentional cliched sex-crazed paying guests (the film's only failure) think it is all part of the show (The Taxidermist is removing the innards of a real human and the guests take a piece of the innards as a souvenir!) until they begin to disappear one-by-one. It is not long until these mental midgets begin to figure out that all the actors supposedly playing the serial killers are the real thing and there is no way to escape. Who will survive and what will be left of them? Can Sheriff Kate (Scottie Thompson), the only non-serial killer with a brain (her Deputy, played by Ben Begley, is even more stupid than the guests at The Funhouse, but proves to be pretty handy with a gun as the film progresses), solve and put an end to this massacre (she is also hiding a secret of her own)? Director Andy Palmer (BADLANDS OF KAIN - 2016), working with a screenplay by Ben Begley (his first feature screenplay), keeps things moving at a bloody quick pace (there's a juicy sequence where Rocco grabs the head of an audience member and pulls it off that is very well done, a graphic scene done with a carnival hammer [the kind you use to ring a bell], as is the scene were Dollface cuts a girl's head off with a knife; effects by Robert Kurtzman) and fills the film with some welcome faces, but the stereotypical stupid people (most who are killed three quarters of the way through the film) that usually inhabit films like this almost made me put the film sown a couple of stars, but like I said in the beginning, I am a sucker for films that take place at amusements parks and carnivals. I'll leave it up to you whether you like it or not. There was enough in this film for me to give it a positive review. Stay until after the end credits for a final stinger.",1477008000,6,3828,4.54927536231884

7683128,2,B01CH6SA7E,"This movie wasn't that great. The wife and I are huge horror buffs, but we had to power through this one. It's like the creators held back on everything. Almost every time, just when you thought ""Here it is, here's where they're going to deliver"" they toned it down or under delivered. They do that with everything, the scares, the sex scenes, the gore. Sucks too cause the premise was awesome. I wasn't expecting much from an acting perspective, I knew that going in.

7683135,1,B01CH6SA7E,"What a major disappointment!
I haven't blind purchased a dvd in years until I read the reviews here on this movie.
The reviews must have all been written by the people involved in making this movie.
I can't say I even enjoyed it..Thankfully I found it in the used bin at the local movie trading store.
And just because the movie stars some of our favorite horror icons doesn't mean it's going to be good..they are starving artists who need the money to eat and pay the bills.
I need not write what the movie is about..read the description like I did..it's just another slapped together new horror movie designed to take our money..lets face it..not many super wealthy average Joe horror fans out there..I overspend on my love of horror when I can't even afford to.
The story is ridiculously boring..I fell asleep during my first 2 viewings..one of those movies where you've seen and heard it all before.
I'm 45 and a hard core horror movie fan..I've literally seen them all..foreign and domestic..I collect my favorites only..over a thousand and still going..If you are one of the few that really do like this..that's great!..I'm sure this would mostly please the very young horror fan..not the conosseuer..you have been warned.
I even spike to other fans on my FB horror groups who also agreed with me..most were thankful they saw it on Netflix first.
I look at my wasted 7 dollars as the cost of a theater ticket..I will definitely trade this away while the movie is still relatively new.",1471046400,,1490,4.712643678160919

Also, a lot of horror movies have the word ""massacre"" in the title, but with only a handful of deaths. (coughs) Texas Chainsaw Massacre series (coughs) However, this movie has a huge body count. If you asked me how many people get killed in this movie, I wouldn't be able to tell you. It could anywhere from 30 to 50. I just don't know. It's a fun movie with some humor and a fast pace.

Okay this is to all my gore fans and to those who like the tongue in cheek type of movie. I loved this movie because of the diversity of the killers. We get a bunch of them! We get the usual kids too but we get many killers! may I say that again, Many Killers. of course, one of my very favorite things has to be that there is some humor tossed in now and then. That is always a big draw for me. The kids are so-so, maybe a couple are good, you decide but the killers! are outstanding. Lots of gore and shocks and frights.

And on that level, it succeeds tremendously. And guess what? It's actually pretty damn funny. It's not trying to be a serious or even scary horror film. So get that thought out of your head. It's cheesy, low-budget horror with some pretty great effects work by Robert Kurtzman (Wishmaster, 1/3 of K.N.B. EFX Group) and a really strong ensemble cast, with some notable cult icons thrown in like Robert England, Clint Howard and Courtney Gains to name a few.

There were no stand-out killers that were really cool and fun to watch. The chef was a bumbling oaf. The dentist never says a word. He doesn't even do anything with teeth. He just drills holes through the back of peoples' heads. The clown is just some huge boring guy. He killed one-too-many guys in professional wrestling? And this occurred more than once?
Clint Howard is always cool, and the clown girl looked hot in her costume.
The best part was seeing Whitey from Colors.
But the absolute worst part, and what ultimately made me turn it off, was the over-use of stupid modern humor. ""I'm gonna Instagram this"", ""I'm gonna vine this"". The obsession with social media bs these days is embarrassing and definitely not funny.
The funniest part was when the 2 radio DJs talked about the $5 off entry fee deal.

I was so disappointed to see he doesn't even make it through the first 15 minutes of the film. The movie wasn't funny, it wasn't shocking and it wasn't scary. It was just stupid. I chose to watch this because it was highly rated. Now I wonder if some people watched the same movie I did. I cared absolutely nothing about the characters or what happened to any of them. Gory scenes were so unbelievable and cheesy. A lot of the movie was cheesy. I don't mind a little comedy in in horror movies, think Krampus and Gremlins but this movie came across as trying to hard to be funny. I can see maybe an adolescent thinking it was humorous. My sister and mother watched this with me and my mom started playing on her iPad halfway through it and my sister asked if we could just please turn it off and watch something else.

7683204,4,B01CH6SA7E,"A group of the nation's most gruesome killers are set free by a follower of charismatic cult leader Mental Manny (Jere Burns) who survived the fire...no pun intended Mr. Burns. They go to a Halloween Funhouse which has displays/exhibits/shows of all of them as they kill their actor doubles and assume their positions at the Funhouse. Audience members are all game after paying an arm and a leg to get in. (Yes they went there with the puns.)

A group of celebrity impersonator restaurant workers attend the event. Laurie (Renee Dorian) is a virgin, so we know who is ""The Final Girl' by formula.

I love Funhouse/Carnival slasher films with clowns, even the bad ones. This film boasts horror icon Robert Englund as the warden and Ice Cream Man Clint Howard who was also on the original Star Trek whose name sounds like the demon from ""The Conjuring 2."" Sorry for that plot spoiler, Hollywood added a demon to the Enfield Haunting, but no aliens. That would be silly and unbelievable.

Ben Begley acted the stereotypical bumbling deputy very well. Chasty Ballesteros played her typical role as ""Hot Asian Chick"" only this time she has a blonde wig. Newcomer Candice De Visser has that nice ""Sherrie Moon Zombie/Victoria DeMare"" crazy twitch down pat.

I'm glad his role in the movie is small because the cast, some familiar and some new faces, stand on their own.  This movie is so clever.  It's a setting that has been visited before in horror movies, but the way it's executed was thought out and something that made this stand out as not another face in the crowd.  The movie has some funny lines and some amazingly brutal violence.  My favorite involves a hammer and a test of strength machine!!

Its such an good & enjoyable horror comedy with some great characters. The gore effects are also really well done. Basic plot is some killers escape a mental hospital/prison, go to a funhouse that was supposed to depict the actual crimes they committed then they really start killing people. It was a simple yet effective concept. 2 characters in particular (the deputy & guy dressed like Machete) had me chuckle quite a few times. The killers are all varied in looks, the methods they use to kill & their backstories are also briefly explained in the beginning. One thing to point out is that Robert Englund has only 5 or so mins of screen time in this. Extras include interviews, commentary, trailer. If you are looking for a really good modern horror with some good comedy thrown in look no further then this film, trust me you won't be disappointed.",1465430400,3,971,4.554285714285714

I thought all the actors did a great job and the story was good and so was the directing. The special effects were noticeably fake but hey you get what you pay for. I really do think some of these low budget films are better than the high budget ones. I really do not nic pic on the special effects of make up effects as long as the acting is good and story and directing is good then you have yourself a movie make up effects and special effects are bonuses.
