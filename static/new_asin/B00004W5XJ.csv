1362364,5,B00004W5XJ,"Why can't American T.V. be like this? I ask myself this question alot. A lovely and funny story about people. No in-your-face sexuality or violence or stupid 12-year old boy humor.
A show for adults that's intelligent and just wonderful. And the stars of the show aren't 24, they are in their fifties, and they actually look like real people in their fifties (well, Judy Dench does her best, but it's hard to turn a silk purse into a sow's ear, not that fifty year old people should be equated with a sow's ear, just an expression!)
It's just a show about life with the quirky turns, ups and downs that occur. It makes you want to pack your bags and move across the water, or at least find a  neighborhood pub for a pint of beer.",1037750400,44,729,4.321167883211679
1362365,5,B00004W5XJ,"""As Time Goes By"" stars Judi Dench & Geoffrey Palmer as Jean Pargetter and Lionel Hardcastle, who were once lovers in the early 1950s. Lionel went to fight in the Korean war, and the two lost touch. In the very first episode of the series, they meet again and slowly begin to rekindle their romance. The wonderful series that ensues is a pleasure to watch.
This DVD contains all 10 episodes of the 4th season of ""As Time Goes By"". This is quite an important, funny, and emotional season in the show's history. And, oh, how wonderful it looks on DVD!
Within the 4th season occurs the 25th wedding anniversary of Penny & Stephen (in-laws of Jean), a new ""boy""friend for Jean's daughter Judith, Jean's secretary Sandy moving-in to the household, the completion of Lionel's script for a mini-series based on his & Jean's young love affair, and, most importantly, the wedding of Jean & Lionel.
And as for how it looks on DVD: WOW. Now, I have watched British television shows on DVD before, but never has one looked so stunning. The colors are brilliant, the lines are crisp, the picture comes alive. There is one scene in particular, in the episode where Jean & Lionel are on their honeymoon in the hills of Scotland. It looks STUNNING. I'm sorry to gush, but I was just *very* taken aback. By all means, if you are able to, I would recommend getting the 4th season on DVD.
Well, there you have it. If you want a nice, gentle, warm, romantic and funny series with sincere characters and an interesting, hilarious plotline, then by all means start watching ""As Time Goes By"" today.",1018137600,98,1576,4.592198581560283
1362366,5,B00004W5XJ,"...My first introduction to "" As Time Goes By "" was actually by way of my local PBS television station. Stumbling upon it about three years ago I found myself instantly hooked to it's marvelous, grown-up characters, witty style of dialogue ( thank-you Bob Larbey! ) and the warm intimate nature that filled every episode. ...I, at first, simply thought that because it's a ""Britcom"" than perhaps I was heaping undue praise for a program that just maybe was slightly unjustified.....but after giving that much thought I've come to a much different conclusion. That being "" As Time Goes By "" works due to one important ingredient. And that is simply due to the fact that, after watching several enticing episodes, you not only enjoy and like Jean Pargetter ( Judi Dench ) and Lionel Hardcastle ( Geoffrey Palmer ) and Co. but you truly do care about them as well. While I can easily rattle off a dozen different programs where I enjoy the cast of characters this is the only show where I, strangely enough, find myself truly wishing the entire cast, also featuring daughter Judith ( Moira Brooker ), Sandy ( Jenny Funnell ) and the ever jovial, man about-town Alastair ( Philip Bretherton ) all the best and really caring about what happens to them. Fully realizing that my concern for a fictional television family borders on bizarre but that's the effect this wonderful show has on me....and I must add it also shows  how extremely well everyone is practicing their craft! Also, by pacing the program at a nice, leisurely rate they have wisely decided to let the viewers 'slowly but assuredly' get to know each cast member in their own time, without the need to force the viewer to accept the character immediately. That's an important aspect of this wonderful program and one that I truly wish we would see more often.
Wisely, the producer of this remarkable series, Stuart Lotterby, has decided, instead of 'chopping-up every half-hour episode with a nice tidy ending ( which would simply take away the honesty that is the cornerstone of ATGB! ),he's allows  the series a feeling of true continuity by letting past situations and concerns rise up in future programs. Thereby awarding the show with a sense of how true life does tend to actually be, instead giving the viewer the unrealistic sense that 'all's well that end's well!' after 30 odd minutes.' It's an important part of a show that, instead of relying on calculated, over-the-top situations feels much more like the viewer actually being given the luxury of being with Jean and Lionel as they go about their lives, and we are priviledged enough to be able to sit back and enjoy them and their everyday routines. Not contrived....just a program with so much true heart and warm honesty...",1017446400,76,2750,4.787368421052632
1362367,5,B00004W5XJ,"I began watching this series on PBS and was hooked immediately.  It is a quiet little comedy with a heart.  The characters in this show - Lionel, Jean, Judith, Sandy, and Alistair - are written and acted with depth and quality, a trait that is missing in the majority of American sitcoms today.  From the first episode, these characters draw you into their lives and make you feel as if they are ""real"" people that you'd meet on the street somewhere in your own life.  After all, we've all had letters lost in the mail, known lovers separated by military service (although not all of the men were kicked by a vicious enemy mule as Lionel was in his service!), and known people who were separated by circumstances who've once again found each other.  Watching the dynamics of the Lionel-Jean-Judith-Alistair romantic loop is a reminder that what we think we want in life is not always what's meant to be.  I am constantly amazed at how the Lionel-Jean story mirrors my own life (I recently reunited with a former boyfriend from my high school days 30 years ago) and watch with amusement as I see my own situations being played out on ""As Time Goes By.""  This video is a must-see for anyone who enjoys romantic comedy, good writing and acting, and who believes we can all fall in love -- no matter what age you are or what you've been through in your life.",994550400,4,1354,4.502040816326531
1362368,5,B00004W5XJ,"This is one of the best series' and by far, the best British series ever made. I live in America so I watch this on PBS ,but what I love about is it has no commercials, excellent storyline Judi Dench and Philip Bretherton. They are both so delightful! I watch it every time it comes on. I have never watched a British series before this one, but this turned me on to them. They are  so clean, no profanity, violence, or adult situations in  it. I completely recommend this boxed set as well as the others.",972086400,10,505,4.25
1362369,5,B00004W5XJ,"This is absolutely the most wonderfully written and acted British comedy series ever aired in the US! And between Geoffrey Palmer as Lionel and Philip Bretherton as Alistair (who happens to be gorgeous), I cannot imagine a show with handsomer leading men!  Of course, Judi  Dench is no slouch either and Moira Brooker is really charming, so there's  an excellent cast. The writing is very good - subtle humor and warmth that you  don't normally get from Britcoms. I can't help but gush - buy all of the videos and get to know these people!",956707200,3,539,4.6421052631578945
1362370,5,B00004W5XJ,"Warm, witty and ever so delightful. A true treasure...a rare jewel.  How we would love to sit down to dine with Jean, Lionel, Judy, Sandy and all the ""As Time Goes By"" gang. A warm and tender series, we are  enraptured by each new episode. The writing is top notch, the actors simply  superb. How lovely to finally have these episodes offered on video tape. We  can only hope that the entire series will be offered on tape soon. Please  dear reader, do yourself a favor and invite Jean and Lionel into your  life...they have found each other again and we are all the better for it. A  treasure from start to finish. Who is more delicious than Oscar winner Judi  Dench and the glorious Geoffery Palmer? When you tire of the network  televison assault on your senses...or when you find yourself shuddering at  what passes as *pleasant comedy*, pick up these tapes, fix yourself a hot  cup of tea, settle in and prepare to be delighted.",955411200,5,933,4.526946107784431
1362371,5,B00004W5XJ,"Three more episodes in the romantic adventures of Jean and Lionel, lovers separated during the Korean War who accidentally meet again 38 years later.  The best thing about this show is that no one is portrayed as being stupid  or inept in any way.  Episode 1 (on this tape) introduces Jean's  sister-in-law and her husband.  Penny has a way of getting on people's  nerves, and Jean concocts one lie after another to try to keep Penny from  getting under her skin.  Hilarious results follow. In Episode 2 has Jean's  daughter and employee, Judith and Sandy respectively, becoming more  inquisitive about Jean's private life.  To make matters worse, Lionel  invites Jean to be his ""companion"" on a ""freebie""  cruise.  In Episode 3, Lionel's book, ""My Life in Kenya"", is  finally released.  Lionel does the usual autograph signing, but Jean is  more nervous than Lionel.  She enlists the help of Judith and Sandy to get  everyone they know to buy the book, and buys over 100 copies herself! This  is by far the best show on television (PBS), and I hope that the entire  show will eventually be released on video.",949104000,16,1109,4.761904761904762

1362460,5,B00004W5XJ,"Watching ""As Time Goes By"" is like visiting nice old friends who you can always count on.  They don't shock or disturb you, they make you feel safe and that you're in the company of decent, good people.  Series 4 marks a key turning point in the show as Jean and Lionel decide to marry.  But before that, Jean's secretary Sandy ends up moving in with Jean, Lionel, and Judy and Lionel has to find a graceful way of letting go of his sweet but inexhaustibly talkative secretary Mrs. Flack.  Jean's sister-in-law from her first marriage Penny has a bust up with her husband Stephen and that must be fixed, and Judy finally tells Alistair she's sick of him breezing in and out of her life taking her for granted, a development that will continue for a long time to come!  We also see Lionel agonize about transferring his and Jean's love story into a TV mini-series, and whether or not the real story will shine through all the Hollywood bluster and pumping-up.
I don't say enough about the recurring characters of this show, they all add something to the main characters, whether it's another layer to their personalities or just a good plot for an episode.  It's amazing to see the usually calm, cool and collected Jean fall to pieces when her sister-in-law Penny (Moira Fraser) drops by, passing judgement on Jean through thinly veiled condescending criticism (""Poor Jean"") while her well-meaning but thick as a plank husband Stephen (Paul Chapman) barely gets a word in!  Lionel's family is a hoot and a half on their own!  His father Rocky (Frank Middlemass) is a tower of funny eccentricity, an elegant gentleman but also a born-again-rock-and-roll enthusiast, Rocky's partner in crime Madge (Joan Sims) plays a mean set of drums and is no less eccentric than Rocky.  And then there's Rocky's housekeeper Mrs. Bale... serious-minded (to the point where it's funny) dressed all in black like a Victorian governess who's only hobbies are the shipping forecast and looking after Rocky.
It's nice to see Jean and Lionel (the incomparable Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer) finally tie the knot after being absent in each other's lives for so long.  If you think this means the end of the show have no fear, the best is yet to come...",1413331200,,2229,4.736434108527132

1362674,5,B00004W5XJ,"We have been watching As Time Goes By for years, ever since a friend loaned us the video series.  It is  delightful and enjoyable because it could be, actually, the story of what could have happened in the life of two people, and then followed their lives through  the years.
The only caveat is the occasional stop (am assuming it is because the videos have been subject to much use and are begining to show the effects of wear and tear).; however, we continue holding until the service is restored because it is truly a good series.

May I add here that one of the problems we have with it, and with amazon prime is - getting in touch with someone to help when we need an assist.  If you have a way to do so easily, it would be a big help.  Amazon is usually very aware of such a need, and in other areas makes such a connection available quickly and easilyt.  Please, amazon prime, do give us some help here.",1398902400,,910,4.22543352601156

1362676,5,B00004W5XJ,"I gave this series five stars because it is very unique and always enjoyable.  As Time Goes By is one of the most romantic stories you'll find - lovers seperated by war nearly forty years ago are reunited by chance - and fall in love again.  The main characters are Jean Pargetter (played by Judy Dench), a widow with a single, grown daughter, who runs an office temp service, and Lionel Hardcastle (played by Geoffrey Palmer), former coffee-bean grower from Kenya, who is writing his memoirs and speaking on a lecture circuit.  They meet again by chance when the difficult Lionel employs Jean's secretarial service and the attraction is still there.  The story line is deliciously detailed.  The former lovers go from the totally understandable 'what's past is past, we're too old' mentality to 'why not?""  Their romance is wonderfully real, with very believable comic touches.  Unlike so many series, where many of the characters are so overblown and ridiculous that you could never believe them as real people, Jean and Lionel, and the rest of the cast are all completely believable.  You have a cranky old man, set in his ways, who suddenly finds himself back in love and attempting to fit into his lover's businesswoman's life.  Watching the relationships develop in this show is wonderful.  The writing is exquisite.  The comedy top notch.  Lionel's sarcasm could wither the staunchest of hearts at a hundred paces, and, yet, we see that he has a softer, very honest side that makes him endearingly lovable.  If you are looking for a show to fall in love with, this will do it.  Just make sure you have a lot of time when you start watching.  As time Goes By is like potato chips - you can't have just one.  It is one of my favorite shows ever.",1398729600,,1750,4.688524590163935

Every one of it's nine seasons offers the same pleasant, reassuring, sweetness, laughter and agreement that this is the naturally funny way that a couple who are on the same side deal, with good intent, the same mundane issues that surround us all. Jean and Lionel may be the sweet young grandparents, or parents, you know or wish you knew. Or they may remind you of your relationship. Regardless of your age, there is a calm sweetness and natural hilarity that is reassuring here. For these reasons I've been visiting ""As Time Goes By"" for years.",1397347200,,705,4.559055118110236

1362745,5,B00004W5XJ,"Thank you, Amazon Prime, for bringing in this top quality BBC hit show and for free!  (Well, the cost of Amazon Prime Membership).  This 90's sitcom is better than most anything that is on current primetime.  In fact, wouldn't it be nice if the U.S. TV execs would bring it in to current primetime?  Who would they cast in the Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer parts?  Which American A-list actors around the age of 60 would be willing to play the aging lovers reunited parts and play them so elegantly and then go on to make movies and get Oscar nominations?  Could this happen in America?

This is an excellent series.  Very enjoyable.  Very little is dated about the shows.  I was a bit wary of the very baggy clothes of the younger female cast members, wondering if clothes were that baggy in the 1990's and then I realized that they were hiding personal pregnancies not written on the show.  I can live with that.  The story continues and I'll keep watching until I get through all the series.

This is a favorite.  It stays on my Kindle Carousel.",1391990400,,1049,4.481481481481482

1362893,5,B00004W5XJ,"This is one of the best TV comedies made. The BBC did a great job with the writing and choosing the cast. They all interact so well together that I forget that it is just a TV show. Judi Dench has always been a favorite of mine, and Geoffrey Palmer is a wonderful actor. They act so well together that they seem like a real couple. It has a romantic story line full of humor and wit that women will love. My husband & teenage sons also enjoy watching this show.  It is a classic that one can watch repeatedly. Reality TV is the worst and features no talent what-so-ever, but this show demonstrates true acting abilities. I highly recommend this show but do start at season 1. Enjoy!",1361491200,,682,4.286821705426356

1362901,4,B00004W5XJ,"With all of the nastiness on most series, it's really refreshing to find a series in which the people treat each other decently. No cursing, no put-downs, nearly no lying, and the main characters respecting one another. it's also great that they are not 20 or 30-somethings.  So much on TV makes one think that people older than 40 need to be doddering fools or worse.
That said, it's at least 10 years old, and because it's British, of course there are references that Americans just don't get.  So what?  It's a nice series.",1360627200,,526,4.574468085106383
1362902,5,B00004W5XJ,"As with the previous three seasons, Season 4 continues to develop the quirky and quick-witted characters that make this such a delightful series.

It is a great show.",1287705600,,333,3.7971014492753623

1362910,4,B00004W5XJ,"I've owned the full ""As Time Goes By"" series for over a year now and play it over and over again.  The dialogue, the characters, and highly able actors make this series one of the best I've ever seen.  Up late at night doing ironing?  Slip in a disk.  Need to spend time sorting through papers for taxes?  Pop one in.  Just want to sit back after a long day and enjoy something pleasant and funny?  Pick one.  Bedridden for a time and out of your mind with boredom?  Start at the beginning and play right through.

So why only a 4?  The disks themselves are a bit unreliable.  I bought the series through an Amazon affiliate.  I had to exchange the first disk, which wouldn't play, and the supplier promptly provided a working one.  As time went by (yes, I know),the last disk in the series became unusable.  By then, I had no information for the affiliate, so I bought series 11 directly from Amazon.  As Alistair would say, no probs.

For anyone who values upbeat, intelligently funny and occasionally silly, well-executed programming, I can't recommend this series highly enough.",1269475200,,1082,4.5811518324607325

1362913,5,B00004W5XJ,"I wholehearted agree with almost everyone here that ""As Time Goes by"" is a wonderful series.  Of course it probably appeals to mostly older couples who can relate to the back and forth dialog. My wife and I were looking for something to fill out the summer months and we started by ordering Series 1 and have since purchased the entire series.  The only warning I want to give is that the picture on this purchase (Series 4) show the entire 9 years, not just series 4. You don't get seven packaged DVDs as shown.  The other thing i wanted to mention is that I purchased the series for an Amazon competitor as Amazon will not let me select the shipper and we no longer accept anything from DHL as we had a very bad experience with them.

1362916,5,B00004W5XJ,"Following the romance of Jean and Lionel is one of my guilty pleasures. The unfolding of their history and the development of their current relationship is best enjoyed with a cup of tea, snuggled on the sofa, with nothing pressing to do.

1362920,5,B00004W5XJ,"One of the best TV series of all time.  Well written, wonderful cast and great direction.  The humor is universal.  No snappy one-liners or sophmoric slapstick.  Just a show that  humorously and realistically deals with a heart-warming love story.  The entire series is uniformly excellent.  Most other shows have an occasional episode in the series that's not up to par, but not hthis one. Start watching it from Series One and I guarantee you will be hooked!",1048723200,20,460,4.896103896103896

7924902,1,B00004W5XJ,"Deplorable. Season 3 was simply awful, but I still held out promise for Season 4, which has turned out even worse. Lionel has turned into a complete jerk, and Jean just puts up with it, until Lionel relents into simply having to ""act"", momentarily, as though he's an actual decent human being, which he never is. Once again, he's given everything on a silver platter, and treats everyone else with contempt. Sandy has a need to move in temporarily in Jean's house, but Lionel disapproves and wants to put her on the streets. Sandy stays, but she gets hers, oh yes she does. Lionel disallows her from taking a bath upstairs until someone else has arrived because it would make him feel uncomfortable. Sandy complies, after working all day while Lionel's been sitting about reading newspapers, and when Jean finally arrives and Sandy explains to Jean Lionel's prohibition, Jean rewards Lionel for his gallantry. Lionel gets yet another secretary - wait, why does Lionel always need a secretary to write anyway? oh, yes, they do most of the writing for him -  from Jean's second branch office who happens to be pretty and young. Jean, immediately jealous, gets her sacked. Coming to her senses, Jean reinstates the secretary and assigns her once again to Lionel, who does everything and anything to make Jean jealous. Falling for it all, Jean watches their every move from another room. Lionel is again - and how unrealistically? - provided another grand opportunity for a miniseries based on his horrible book by Alistair, that Lionel takes for granted, as usual, and Jean patches over his typical rudeness to save the day, as usual. Lionel soon calls his father and his wife idiots while in the hospital, but accepts their gift of the ""house"" before the old man has even passed on, which he's destined to soon given his ill health. Until then, they live in the ""cottage"". Though, these are neither houses nor cottages. This is a vast estate, with mansion, pool, it looks like a chapel, ""cottage,"" whatever that is; and the bizarre, spoiled rotten behavior on the part of both Lionel and his father scream out the fact that they've inherited everything and worked for nothing. Oddly enough, Lionel never actually thanks his father for the ""house"", but only approaches it, for which we the audience are supposed to melt. After receiving the inevitable inheritance, Lionel decides to propose to Jean who accepts before he even asks, her ""yes"" appearing quite tangibly as though she's accepting it because of the ""house"". In a moment that should have gone off as sweet and romantic, Lionel makes a half-hearted attempt to propose, fails, and she accepts his ""proposal"" anyway, followed by one the most awkward kisses in television history. With a ""house"" now, Lionel needs to do less than nothing, because he's been doing so ever since the series began, besides act the boor. It's all so disgusting. Judi Dench should be ashamed.",1495929600,,2924,4.871485943775101
