2326005,5,B0009W309M,"Great, inexpensive way to collect classic films in DVD. I bought several of these -including this one- and found the quality to be good overall on the films. If you collect, be sure to match up the films in the Mystery Classic DVDs with larger compilations. It might be cheaper to buy the ones you want in a set of 50 films. Personally, I like the Mystery Classics because I get more movies I like. With compilations, I usually only like a few out 50 or 100.",1387929600,11,458,4.275862068965517
2326006,5,B0009W309M,"You will find all these movies worth watching. Some of the best from the 1940s. The actors and picture as well as sound is very good. There are four movies in this set, Dick Tracy, Detective, Mystery Liner the best of the four. Doomed to die, a Mr. Wong movie and Shock with  Vincent Price.",1367193600,13,290,4.2727272727272725
2326007,5,B0009W309M,"A wonderful old movie, starring two Classy men. Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff make every movie they are in a mystery.",1359763200,2,117,4.619047619047619
2326008,4,B0009W309M,"In this particular volume, I had seen one before and the other three were as entertaining as I expected. These are the kind of mysteries I grew up with. No unnecessary useless violence and foul language - but still great entertainment.",1304208000,21,235,4.7560975609756095
2326009,2,B0009W309M,Frankly couldn't enjoy because the sound was not clear enough to understand.  The film may have been good but when the sound is difficult to hear you lose in the interpretation.,1303776000,11,177,4.709677419354839
2326010,5,B0009W309M,"For those who love to watch the old mystery clasics with vincent Price and Boris Karloff, you can not go wrong on this.",1284076800,10,119,4.217391304347826

2326012,4,B0009W309M,"great compilation of movies from vintage hollywood when actors knew how to act and didn't look like they were made from a cookie cutter, writers could write and neither relied on computer imaging, bad language or fast car chases.  just pure clean entertainment.",1468368000,3,261,5.069767441860465
2326013,4,B0009W309M,"Some tales are truly good, while some are OK. There are no real duds. Again, good stuff if you like period pieces and are drawn to the 30s and 40s.",1456963200,6,147,3.933333333333333

2326015,5,B0009W309M,"This is a nice set of older mystery movies.  Although occasionally a word or phrase would be skipped for some reason, it was still understandable.
It would be nice to get a whole collection of Nancy Drew movies starring Bonita Granville, but I have not yet found a complete set.",1453766400,2,278,4.56

2326025,5,B0009W309M,"Karloff, Price... two names well-known in the suspense arena.  And none do suspense better ...even today.  Bring back the old classics, the well-seasoned actors who take their roles seriously and make you believe the characters they portray are real.... at least on screen.

Boris Karloff stars in Doomed to Die, as Mr. Wong, investigating the death of a shipping mogul.
Vincent Price stars in Shock!, as Dr. Cross, a psycho psychiatrist.
Morgan Conway stars in Dick Tray, Detective, as Dick Tracy, hunting a notorious criminal named Splitface.
Noah Beery stars in Mystery Liner as ship's captain along with Edwin Maxwell as a detective Major Pope, investigating murder and suspicious  activities on-board an ocean liner fitted with a newly designed remote-controlled steering device.

Sound quality is fantastic and clear.  The video is nice and sharp and crisp.  It's like you're right there, watching it in person.",1430352000,15,917,5.2827586206896555

2326029,4,B0009W309M,"The best movie on this one is SHOCK with Vincent Price. DOOMED TO DIE is also good, but for me it's a duplicate. I own the complete James Lee Wong detective series and DOOMED TO DIE is on it. I already own 8 other volumes of the Mystery Classics Collection.",1427155200,2,257,4.16

8067756,3,B0009W309M,"I liked seeing Boris Karloff as a good guy. I enjoyed the film.

And Vincent Price did a good job. He was a decent actor.

Is this the DVD that had one with Hugh Beaumont from ""Leave It To Beaver""?  Not a good movie but fun to see him in the role he played.",1522800000,,257,3.7222222222222223
