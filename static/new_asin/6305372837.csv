Alice (Tina Majorino) is having a horrible daydream about singing ""Cherry Ripe"". When she comes to, her nanny (Mary Healey) is brushing her hair and wonders what is wrong with her. She looks pale as a ghost. The governess (Dilys Laye) walks in a tells her to drink a strong herbal tea. She only has stage fright. Alice has made up her mind, She doesn't want to sing in front of people after tea. Her mother (Janine Eser) walks in and tells her she doesn't have to, but the guests will be disappointed. A nervous Alice goes into a room and sits in a chair and talks to her playful kitten, Dinah.
  The strange guests have arrived for the tea party. Alice goes out of the house the back way and walks to the edge of the woods and sits under an apple tree. An apple falls and stops in mid-air and spins. Suddenly, a white rabbit runs by. Alice runs into the woods after the rabbit. She goes through some brush and then into a cave through the bottom of the tree. It's a tunnel with roots and then she falls into a huge hole falling way down. She lands on a sofa chair and walks into a hallway of doors. This will lead her into the land of Wonderland.

1013246,3,6305372837,"I'd come across this version of Alice's Adventures over Christmastime a few years ago. I enjoyed the Martin Short Mad Hatter scenes quite a bit, the rest of it not so much. It dates from 1999. It tries to do every scene from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and mixes in a few from Through the Looking Glass, in an attempt to give all the stars their star turns. The pace is quite slow at times. Some of the visuals are beautiful, and what the Henson Studio accomplished with this using puppetry (or is it advanced Muppetry?) works quite well at times. I bought it because I could not count on being able to see it on YouTube or on cable anytime soon, and the Mad Hatter scenes are great mood-lifters.",1455148800,,702,4.407692307692308

1013249,5,6305372837,"This is the best original adaptation of Alice in Wonderland out there. I have seen the 2010 version and can say no matter how much CGI you add to that film it doesn't have the emotional conviction the way this one does. Tina Majorino does an amazing job with the role of Alice in this version of the classic we all know and love. I love how they did the characters and how they made them real. They didn't seem silly or over the top in anyway to me. They seemed like people you could see in person at one point or another.

I also loved the darkness of this film and I feel that gave it a truth and honesty about it. Alice being truly scared and learning more about herself through this movie seemed realistic. Where in the 2010 remake it was more of a random and out of place plot. I didn't understand the ending and the point of the story in that remake. Where this one has a beginning middle and end.

The start where you see Alice is nervous to sing in front of all the party guests and her mother is guilting her into it. ( That was just mean). She ends up falling into the rabbit hole and along the way she learns to stand up for herself and have a voice. Which in the end comes into play in every way. I know when I was a kid and growing up and I came across this it was very much an important film in my life. I just loved everything about it. The darkness and intrigue and the mystery of Wonderland.

I think if you love the story of Wonderland give this a chance it's such a brilliant told story in this adaptation.",1452988800,9,1525,4.059800664451827

1013398,4,6305372837,"I have recently come to love ""Alice in Wonderland"" and own several different versions on DVD.  No, I'm not a purist but it is still hard to overlook different aspects of each that simply do not meet my standards.  If someone held a gun to my head I would have to say that this version comes the closest to doing that.  No, it does not follow the book exactly but I knew that it wouldn't even before watching it for the first time.  To be honest, the only real gripe I have about it is that most of the actors seemed rather wooden.  The best performance was Martin Short and his inclusion was the reason that I purchased this version in the first place.  Even Whoopie Goldberg seemed to dial in her performance and I found that a little bit shocking.  It was not one or two actors that seemed not to care but almost the entire cast.  That makes me wonder if it is the fault of the director or producer.

Overall, I was not bored by this version.  It really turned out to be quite good.  The special effects were beyond ordinary and really added to the film.  The scenery was well done to the point that I didn't feel as if it was two dimensional like some of the other versions.

To be fair, it is really hard not to compare this version to the later version by Tim Burton.  (which really should have been titled Alice in Wonderland Revisited)  I wish that Tim Burton had done the actual Alice In Wonderland.  Now that would be the best version.

1013474,5,6305372837,"The second of my Alice in Wonderland movie reviews is one of my favorites: I used to sit and watch this version when I stayed home sick from school, or if it was a particularly rainy Saturday afternoon. So yes, there is definitely some nostalgia added to my enjoyment of this movie that probably clouds my review.

I think this version is utterly charming. It is by no means the most well done  as far as special effects go, but there is something so entertaining and light-hearted in this version that you don't see in other versions. This Wonderland is a whimsical, cheery place, where the inhabitants are quirky, fanciful, and sure, some are even a bit mad, but they all make the audience smile rather than cringe or shrink back in fear.

Because Alice has a fear of performing (a task her parents have charged her with at a tea they are hosting), the inhabitants of Wonderland spend their time helping her to not be afraid. This means that there are plenty of musical numbers. But when actors like Martin Short (The Mad Hatter), Gene Wilder (Mock Turtle), Whoopi Goldberg (Cheshire Cat), Ben Kingsley (Caterpillar), Robbie Coltrane (Tweedledum), Christopher Lloyd (The White Knight) and Miranda Richardson (Queen of Hearts) are leading this incredible ensemble, every scene feels more delightful than the last. The songs, while some are cheesy or silly, add a lovely layer to the whimsical nature of the movie. The actors mentioned above are only some of the big names in this version. The cast is stuffed with well-known actors who fill the roles with excitement and fun.

Alice is played by a young Tina Majorino, of Veronica Mars and Napoleon Dynamite fame. Majorino, while not necessarily inspiring in the role, is an adorable, charming Alice, wandering through a dream-like land full of nutty characters, going along with whatever they say. She has a certain child-like curiosity about Wonderland, and shes the only Alice Ive ever wished I could trade places with.

As I said earlier, this is perhaps not the most well made version; some of the characters are Jim Henson animatronics creatures; the special effects are rather bad (though it was made in 1999, so most special effects from then seem bad nowadays), but the acting is marvelous, the setting extremely whimsical, and the script is very clever. If you love Alice and are looking for something a little different and probably lighter than the usual Wonderland fare, I recommend checking out this charming version.

1013809,4,6305372837,"This is an Emmy-winning 1999 made-for-TV version of Alice in Wonderland starring Tina Majorino as Alice. Like the more popular 1985 Irwin Allen-produced version, the 1999 version boasts an impressive supporting cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lloyd, Miranda Richardson, Martin Short and Gene Wilder (just before going into his semi-retirement).

The production is unique in blending live-action actors with puppets created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The White Rabbit is not an actor in a rabbit costume, but a puppet that walks and talks. Digital effects are also used, giving an interesting touch to some characters like the Hatter (played by Martin Short), whose enlarged head looks uncannily like that of John Tenniels illustration.

The adaptation is not exactly faithful to the source material. Like Disney animation version, some characters of the sequel Through the Looking-Glass appear, like the Walrus (Peter Ustinov) and the Carpenter (Pete Postlethwaite) from the famous poem. The idea is not bad, but less effective is the frame story about Alice singing before the audience. I really don't see the point.

In this version Alice (played endearingly by Tina Majorino-such an expressive face) does not chase the rabbit to escape a boring lesson from her dreary older sister as in the 1951 Disney animated movie, but to escape from having to sing for an audience of her mother's friends-she does not want to leave wonderland in order to not have to do so, and only does so when she overcomes her fears-many of the characters she meets exhorts her to be courageous.
the scene where she has fallen through the rabbit hole and is in the lobby behind the garden she longs to go into, captures the vivid dreamlike quality quite accurately and memorably.
And Alice's combination of spirit and innocence is very charming, in the role paled by Tina Majorino.

Great performances by Whoopi Goldberg well animated in the role of the Cheshire Cat, Ben Kingsley palys a perfectly authoritative Major Catterpillar, Elizabeth Spriggs as the Duchess, who despite her forbidding first appearance turns out to be quite sympathetic , and Miranda Richardson as a very shrill and bad tempered Queen of Hearts.
And then there is Gene Wilder as the Mock Turtle, in his own special performance, with his unforgettable combination of wit and wisdom. George Wentdt And Robbie Coltrane were incorrigible and great fun as Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.
In the end sequence many of the guests at her mother's garden party are played by the characters in Wonderland, and provide quite a finish.",1388361600,2,2635,6.54727793696275

1013813,4,6305372837,"First, this is a very good rendition. It stays close to Dodgson's story, and even calls to mind the Tenniel wood engravings in its visual style. It uses special effects effectively, without letting them crowd out the huge personalities in the cast - effects serve the story, not they other way `round. Then there's the cast: Ben Kingsley, Whoopi Goldberg, Christopher Lloyd, Gene Wilder, and a flock of other massively talented actors - plus an engaging and likable young lady in the title role.

So, that's my question, really: given all those mind-boggling acting skills, how could so little have been made of them? Wilder's turtle dance was pathetic, Kingsley's caterpillar could have projected a more complex personality, Goldberg never got a chance - they had all these great performing artists, and basically ordered each one to phone on their performance.

This Alice is nice, really. I like it. But, with all the ability on stage at one time or another, it should have been great - not just nice.

In particular, I find the Duchess and the Tweedledum/Tweedledee segments very funny and odd.

1014006,4,6305372837,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1999 production of Alice in Wonderland...
The 90's was a good decade for Alice. In 1993 an interpretive dance of Alice in Wonderland was performed by the Prague Chamber Ballet (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ALICE-IN-WONDERLAND-A-Dance-Fantasy/dp/B000MRNWSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ALICE IN WONDERLAND: A Dance Fantasy</a>). In the same year a hilarious takeoff on AIW was rendered as an installment of the `Hello Kitty"" cartoon series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hello-Kitty-Friends-Vol-3-Timeless-Tales/dp/B00029NMJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hello Kitty & Friends, Vol. 3: Timeless Tales</a>), which was followed by another hilarious cartoon version in 1995 done in anime (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miyuki-Chan-in-Wonderland/dp/B0000639E5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland</a>). Also in 1995 there was yet another, although more sober, rendering of AIW in cartoon form (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Jetlag-Productions/dp/B00006RCMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Jetlag Productions)</a>). And in 1998 we were treated to one of the most accurate visual manifestations of Carroll's second Alice book `Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass/dp/B0006FO9C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice Through the Looking Glass</a>).

This Alice movie under review works well on so many levels I don't know where to begin. Actually I think the place to begin is where the movie does NOT work. Let's get the negatives out of the way because there are so many positives to comment on. As an audience we have to accept that every single Alice movie ever made departs from the book to one degree or another. It's just a question of degree. But even with the acknowledgment that a dead reckoning of the book is not feasible, I've noticed a pattern in many Alice films whereby the producers/writers veered away from the book for no apparent reason. One or more of Alice's encounters with the creatures of Wonderland are dropped, other characters are made up, elements of a scene are arbitrarily changed, passages from 'Looking Glass' are blended into the original story, the story is adapted as a musical, and most important: dialog is altered. In some cases these changes can be accepted as a function of the many tradeoffs required to get the film made in the first place. But it's the completely unnecessary alterations, especially to the core Lewis Carroll dialog between Alice and the Wonderland creatures that are hard to accept. Replacing the precious nonsensical Carroll dialog with some writers idea of what would work better is in and of itself nonsensical. Unfortunately this great movie fell to the spell of this dialog disaster. Now on to the positives...

Of all the Alice films made since the first one in 1903 I've never really seen the characters from the book brought to life quite like this. Kudos to Jim Henson's Creature Shop for rendering John Tenniel's drawings as animatronic based Wonderland characters. The deserved their Emmy for this effort.

With regard to the performances, if there ever was an actor born to play the Mad Hatter it has to be Martin Short. In fact, Short's real life middle name is `Hayter'!! The man literally becomes what you could imagine the Mad Hatter to be like. I mean, you look at his interpretation of the character and go, `Yeah, so that's the Mad Hatter'. Martin's appearance is quite similar to Tenniel's illustration of the character. The Hatter's sidekick, the March Hare, is one of the standout animatronics characters. Together they make the Tea Party scene one of the funnest to view.

I also really enjoyed Gene Wilder's rendition of the Mock Turtle. One of the most pathetic Mock Turtles to date, which is great because the character is indeed pathetic as written. And props must be offered up to Tina Majorino, who at the age of 14 absolutely nailed the Alice role (she also played the young girl in Water World). I was a bit dubious of Tina at first, but after a few minutes all doubts were dispelled. Just as with Kate Beckinsale's performance in `Alice: Through the Looking Glass' the previous year, you can literally see Tina thinking as she works to decode the puzzle of Wonderland. Anyway, this is just a smattering of the notable performers in this well put together cast.

The movie starts off as several of the Wonderland film adaptations do; with a 'Wizard of Oz' style opening whereby characters from Alice's real life world become the characters of her Wonderland dream. The story actually keeps time to a theme set up in this opening where we have Alice suffering from stage fright. Her journey through Wonderland endows her with the self-confidence needed to not only pull off her real life performance, but to act on her intuition as well. This of course is an added layer of story telling not part of the book. Although purists [rightfully] object to this addition, I didn't find it all that distracting.

One of the other liberties taken was to fold a few scenes from `Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There' into the main AIW story. This is common and has been done at least as far back as the 1933 Hollywood film starring Charlotte Henry. In fact this production mimics the 1933 film in that Alice temporarily steps out of Wonderland, experiences several Looking Glass encounters (in this case they cut from the Lobster Quadrille to having Alice step through a mirror and meet the White Knight, talk to the Garden of Live Flowers, watch the Tweedles enact the Walrus and the Carpenter poem), and then gets called back to wonderland for the tart trial. The Looking Glass scenes were all well done though. I thought the Walrus and the Carpenter poem enactment in particular was a stroke of genius.

The courtroom for the trial is lavishly laced with a playing card motif. It is one of the best renderings of the courtroom I've witnessed to date. The costuming of the Red King and Queen is also the best I've seen since the rare 1932 American version with Ruth Gilbert (available on EBay). I must paraphrase what a reviewer stated on IMDB, that in this scene the logic of the trial is as flimsy as the house of cards it takes place in. :>

What else? A nice bonus with this edition of AIW is the inclusion of the puppy sequence. This is the first Alice I've seen where they reproduced the puppy that Alice runs into upon shrinking herself and escaping from the rabbit's house. Another first is the rendering of the table in the Hall of Doors as 100% glass, as described in the book.

Enjoy this very kid friendly version of Alice in Wonderland!

1014008,4,6305372837,"There have been so many versions of this story done on film already, you'd think we didn't need one more. This one is pretty special for a few reasons. First, it was made for TV by the British, who understand Lewis Carroll in ways Americans really don't. So there's a bit more back story for Alice before she goes down the rabbit hole. She's supposed to be singing ""Cherry Ripe,"" a street vendor's little ditty, for a garden party full of rather odd people. In fact, these odd people show up in Wonderland.

She ran away to a wooded area to avoid the party, and there had a very surreal adventure, most of which you know by now. So let's just name some of the stars of this fun movie.

Alice is played by Tina Majorino, and I don't know if she's done any other films. She was a child in this one, after all, but that was 13 years ago.

Whoopie Goldberg plays the Cheshire Cat.
Ben Kingsley is the caterpillar.
Martin Short is the Mad Hatter.
Peter Ustinov is the Walrus (the one with the carpenter).
Gene Wilder is the Mock Turtle.

1014009,5,6305372837,"Die meisten werden sich sicherlich fragen: Was ist berhaupt das Wunderland? Mglicherweise ist es einfach nur ein Traum. Alice sollte nmlich auf einer Feier singen, wovor sie aber bange war und sich dann im Garten versteckte. Es scheint fast so, als ob sie eingeschlafen wre und dann im Traum ins Wunderland teleportiert worden wre. Dort trifft sie auf verschiedene Fabelwesen, und alle raten Ihr, dass sie wieder zurckkehren sollte.

Die in der Beschreibung erwhnte Whoppi Goldberg spielt die Grinsekatze.
Die hier eigentliche Schauspielerin fr Alice, Tina Majorino, ist bereits aus Waterworld bekannt. Aber dieses Mal wirkt sie viel lebendiger und frhlicher. Anstatt wie in anderen Alice-Filmen betont erwachsen zu sein, wird Alice bewusst als Kind gespielt. Ein ''echtes Mdchen'' in diesem Film macht mir letztlich viel mehr Spa als eines, dass betont erwachsen und eine perfekte Erzieherin sein will.

Zu den sesten zhlen sicherlich die Szenen, wo Alice hbsche Locken hat, weil sie ganz nass sind. Eigentlich nur deswegen, weil sie vorher durch Wassertunnel geschwommen war. Aber scheinbar wurde mehrfach ''nachgeholfen'', und die nassen Haare wurden auch noch niedlich frisiert. Manche werden womglich denken: ''Das arme Mdchen!''. Aber die Studio-Scheinwerfer sollen angeblich eine brennende Hitze abstrahlen, und vielleicht ist manch ein Schauspieler fr die Abkhlung sogar dankbar. Tina hat auf jeden Fall mein riesiges Lob, dass sie wirklich ins Wasser gesprungen ist und dadurch auch die Originalgeschichte des Buches erfllt hat.

Die Raupe und alle Bewohner des Wunderlandes werden von Star-Schauspielern gespielt, auch wenn nicht alle gleichermaen bekannt sind. Alle Schauspieler htten das Potenzial, die bisherigen Hollywood-Millionre abzulsen. Auch die Effekte und Kulissen sind super, ein Bild schner als das andere. Der Film basiert weitgehend auf der Geschichte ''Alice im Wunderland'', whrend ''Alice hinter den Spiegeln''
keine Rolle spielt  Aber die Gesangsprobe, die Alice Kummer bereitet, wurde nur speziell fr diesen Film erfunden.

Der Film soll ursprnglich ein Zweiteiler gewesen sein. Dass die europische Version offenbar gekrzt wurde, ist schade. Beide machen Spa. 20 Minuten Unterschied bei der amerikanischen Version - da wird die Erklrung mit unterschiedlichen Formaten schon schwieriger. Welche Szenen in der europischen Version tatschlich fehlen, konnte ich noch nicht herausfinden.

In order to compare this ALICE with others, I would have to watch the other ones, and that's not happening. One alternative version I can attest to & compare is the original Disney cartoon. That version rates the highest score of 5 Big Ones (Stars). So based on that, I compared this ALICE.

Let's look at the somewhat negative areas first.

I have nothing at all against Miranda Richardson, but she is sorely miscast as the Red Queen. I picture the Queen as plump, almost beefy with a basso profundo, bellowing voice; not the incessant srceeeeeching of Richardson's screaming delivery. It's not pleasant, but not too bad. 3 stars. The perfect actor to play the role would be someone like...well, like the brilliant British character actress Elizabeth Spriggs. Oh darn...she's already cast as The Duchess--and what an absolutely perfect Duchess she is. 5 stars for the Duchess--and 5 stars for the entire cooking scene with the wacko cook throwing things & the fabulous animated crying baby!

[NOTE: Sadly, Elizabeth Spriggs is now deceased.]

The scene with the White Knight falls flat & lasts too long. This occurs at a time when the film needs to build pace, rather than holding it back. Oh, boo...can't even give this scene 3 stars. Have to give it 2.

Finally, I have to agree with other reviewers who thought the actress playing Alice presenteted a pretty much one-dimensional rendition of the role. It may have been the actor's acting, or a case of poor direction (although other scenes don't point that way.) Again, not that bad. 3 stars.

Now to the plus side.

First of all, I have to give a tremendous bravo to the Jim Henson Creative Company that renders puppet, actors & animation into a seamless & wondrous whole. BIG FIVE STARS!

Martin Short steals the show as the Mad Hatter (the ""Hatter"" usually does.) Martin is perfection incarnate in this role & brings down the house with his song & dance routine, ""Aunty's Got A Wooden Leg!"" Five Big Ones.

Whoopie Goldberg's' Cheshire Cat is great--& another testament to the seamless special effects. Her voice is soooooooo mellow it sounds like she may have had a few hits from the Caterpillar's hookah, but then aren't all cats a little like that? 4 Stars.

I thought Gene Wilder was very affective as the sad-sack singing Mock Turtle. The staging of his scene was fantastic too, effectively borrowing techniques from early European theatre. It's the Turtle who teaches Alice how to loose her stage fright and learn to smile & sing. Wilder is adorable in his turtle costume 5 Stars.

The conclusion ties up some loose ends. At the beginning Alice is resisting being forced to perform in front of friends & relations. It's possible that this idea was the cause of Alice's mostly monotone characterization, so she could drop it at the end & reveal how she had benefited from her Trip. The assembled group, as in the Wizard of Oz, included the characters in Wonderland (now dressed in their Victorian best.) Alice sings, ""Do you dance, do you want to join the dance?"" Everybody applauds & starts singing with her.

I liked it.

1. It's suppose to start with her sister reading her a history lesson, not some stupid song Alice has to sing in front of a stupid party. But then again the Tim Burton version (which in my opinion much better than this piece of garbage) was different in the beginning to.
2. Alice is too dull (heck, the Disney animated version is better than her).
3. The mouse, dodo, and the birds are nothing more than old people in fur coats and such.
4. Pat and Bill are just two guys wearing green (Bill should be a lizard, not some old guy with an irish accent).
5. The caterpillar is suppose to be blue, not red (I've read both of the books at least 15 times).
6. The frog and fish footmen look nothing like a frog or a fish.  Cheapskates.
7. The Duchess is suppose to be ugly.
8. No offense, but I find Martin Short annoying.
9. The Auntie's Wooden Leg song isn't even in the book.
10. The Mad Hatter gets the Twinkle Twinkle little bat poem wrong.
11. The Queen of Hearts is extremely annoying (I thought my ears were going to bleed)
12. Gene Wilder looked nothing like the Mock Turtle in the book.
13. Tweedledum and Tweedledee look nothing alike. Why use two actors when you can get actual twins or computer generate them?
14. The Walrus was nothing more than a fat guy with a huge mustace (sp?).
15. The fact that the King of Hearts tell Alice that she needs to get out of Wonderland is just wrong (it screws with the entire ending!!!)

Whoopi Goldberg plays the Cheshire Cat, Miranda Richardson is The Queen of Hearts, Ben Kingsley fills the role of Major Caterpillar, Martin Short is the Mad Hatter, and Tina Majorino is Alice.

Tina's Alice was a departure from the cartoon version of Alice.  While the Disney rendition showed a very happy-go-lucky Alice, cavorting and enjoying the adventures, Tina's Alice is more realistic, I think.  First of all, this actor has a very expressive face, and as each unexpected event occurred in the movie, her eyebrows reflected every emotion--from fear, to concern, to puzzlement.  As she met the characters, there was a certain amount of skepticism conveyed in her expression, as she tried to make sense of it all.

I won't go into the plot or story, as these are familiar to everyone by now.  I will say, though, that I enjoyed this version a lot more than the cartoon...maybe that's due to my age.  Cartoons can be fun, but to really capture the viewer, the ""live action"" presentation is so much better, in my opinion.

As the film concludes, we see that Alice's Adventures have served a purpose.  When she followed the White Rabbit initially, she was trying to escape having to sing at a family event.  When she returns from Wonderland, her experiences there have served a very important purpose.  She now can sing without fear, and displays a newly discovered courage.

1014414,4,6305372837,"If you are reading this you are probably trying to decide if this 'Alice' adaptation is worth watching or you may have already watched it and are wondering about the reaction of other viewers.

It is the most faithful (to the book) adaptation so far (faint praise as most efforts might as well have been original screenplays) and the sets, special effects, make-up and Muppets are light-years better than what others have tried.

But all is not right with this version of 'Wonderland' so Carroll fans should not get their hopes up too high. The adaptation involves some subtraction and a lot of addition (or as the Mock Turtle would say some 'Ambition and Distraction'). Unfortunately what was added does not begin to compensate for what was left out, it only pads the running length.

They added three scenes from 'Through the Looking Glass'. Stuck between the 'Lobster Quadrille' and the 'Who Stole the Tarts' chapters are: 'Tweedledum and Tweedledee', 'The Walrus and The Carpenter', and 'It's My Own Invention' with the White Knight. So the original story takes a not very entertaining detour-although the Walrus-Carpenter bits are fun and it is interesting to see a pre-Hagrid Robbie Coltrane as Tweedledum. Fortunately they group the three scenes together and it is not as disruptive as placing them separately at different points in the story.

Historically, the model for the characters are the illustrations that Carroll commissioned John Tenniel to carve on wood blocks. Although Carroll based the personality of his title character on ten-year-old brunette Alice Liddell, Tenniel had his own vision and gave the illustrated Alice her features and her long blonde hair. Although the movie generally deferred to Tenniel's illustrations, they made a critical error in casting Tina Majorino as Alice. She was 13-14 during the filming and looks ludicrous in the role. She was also quite homely at that age and you are thankful that the director used mostly wide shots so you don't have her face filling the screen. Thankfully her acting is so flat that she does not call much attention to herself. But the overall effect would have been so much better if they had used a younger actress (could they have made it three years earlier and used a 10-11 year-old Kiera Knightley).

The movie works in spite of a poor Alice, in large part because of the other major deviation from the Tenniel look. That would be casting Miranda Richardson as the Queen of Hearts. Instead of a fat and ugly queen we get a delicately beautiful one, and a hauntingly over-the-top performance. But it works because the performance is consistent with Carroll's idea of the queen as: 'a sort of embodiment of ungovernable passion-a blind and aimless Fury'.

And in her surreal make-up you can't take your eyes off Richardson (you literally focus on her face and see nothing else that is in the frame). Her performance was so inspired that she has been playing fairy tale queens ever since.

All the Muppet characters are excellent but for some reason they made Bill the Lizard a man instead of a muppet lizard. Did the producer owe someone a favor? Bill's scene at the Rabbits's House is the third best in the movie; only the croquet match and the trial are better.

And they messed with Carroll's dialogue for no useful purpose or discernible logic. For example they kept all the 'Mock Turtle's' puns, which are hard to follow even in print, while deleting some of the best lines from Alice's scene with the 'Cheshire Cat'; and the tea-party dialogue (and editing) is a shambles. You can't always tell when an original line was omitted but you can tell when something was added by the hack they hired to do the adaptation-all are stupid and some so modern that they are like hearing an off-key note on a flute.

Carroll's dialogue and Alice's thoughts are really the essence of the story.

Someday a director will shoot this thing with mega-reaction shots of Alice (played by a pleasing looking 'young' actress) and with voiceovers of her thoughts-then we will have something that really communicates Alice's curiosity, courage, kindness, intelligence, dignity, and sense of justice. Most important is to communicate her simple wonder (the only wonder about Majorino is how she got the role). The reader was meant to identify with these qualities but only Disney's Alice effectively exhibited them. It's sad when it is easier to identify with the book and with a cartoon Alice than with any of the actresses who have played the role.

Although some part of each chapter is included (Down the Rabbit-Hole, The Pool of Tears, The Caucus-Race, Little Bill, Advice from a Caterpillar, Pig and Pepper, A Mad Tea-Party, The Queen's Croquet-Ground, The Mock Turtle's Story, The Lobster Quadrille, Who Stole the Tarts, and Alice's Evidence), the bookend pieces of the story where Alice is not dreaming are missing. Instead there is a 'Wizard of Oz' kind of scene with the actors out of costume, playing guests at a garden party. This is done entirely to tie in with the writer's annoyingly artless addition of a preachy ""the show must go on"" theme which works to deflate each scene in which it is inserted.

This is the only unforgivable change to the story. Wonderland was not a process of self-discovery or personal development, it was a gift to the real Alice (and to future children) and should always end with the thoughts of Alice's older sister after hearing the details of the dream: 'Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman, and how she would keep, through all the years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood; and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago; and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days'. This is Carroll telling us why he made up the story.

Bottom line it is the best of the Alice films, a little too long but still worth watching-especially for the Miranda Richardson scenes.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1117411200,36,6249,4.8389513108614235

And even harder to find one that doesn't drive us, as parents, mad with the repetitive watching of them.  This movie has achieved that improbable task.

Our 3 year old will often watch the movie during the day and then more than willingly have a repeat viewing when the 13 year old gets home from school.  It holds her attention span throughout and the imaginative and skilled portrayal of all the characters has her laughing and reacting appropriately for the entire movie.  Our 13 year old sings along to the musical parts with glee.  Then after the movie is finished they proceed on to 'play out' the characters in their playtime together.  It is rare to get such a quality film that enthralls children and adults alike and then continues its magic into their play and imagination.

A very well made movie with no bad points, technically or story-wise, that I can perceive .. but then again, I'm not comparing it to the book, nor did we first watch it with a preconceived notion of what to expect.  I and my children enjoy it on it's own merits.  Highly recommended.",1115251200,3,1206,4.516129032258065

Most children cannot sit through the whole movie, and a handful of adults as well. If only those wasteful scenes would have been deleted, the Queen of Hearts' voice toned down a bit, and the ""moral"" of the story completely taken out, it would have nearly mimiced the original idea of the story. Extremely talented and obviously popular actors and actresses were used for many of the roles, some were successful, others... were not. For the over-imaginative, this movie is a great eye catcher, and a wonderful edition to any Alice in Wonderland collector's collection. Perhaps a different writer for the movie would have done the trick? One who knows the ins and outs of the orignal back flap of the tale. Though, with the deep love of Alice and her adventures, we still enjoy the film to the best that we can. We cannot completely give a bad rating, for an attempt was made, but for the knowing that these mistakes could have been prevented, it is not 5 star, sadly.

I think they should have spent some money on a writer though. And it is very slow paced; I could barely sit and watch the whole thing so I doubt most children will.

Despite the big name cast no one really delivers any kind of memorable performance. Miranda Richardson spends most of her scenes doing an impression of Madeline Khan's trademark whine that got old fast. I actually felt sorry for Gene Wilder; why he felt the need to do this compared to what he usually does...the rest of the musical numbers weren't much any better.

1014419,2,6305372837,"Having read ""Alice in Wonderland"" I looked forward to a modern adaptation of the story.  I was not disappointed in some aspects of the film. The special effects, make-up, and costumes are absolutly grand, and the Mad Hatter scene is probably one of Martin Short's best performances. Whoopi Goldberg breathed life into the Cheshire Cat and made the role lively. The casting director did a great job overall assigning roles. Sadly, the movie did not quite take off. This is because the director didn't cut out a lot of unnecessary ""junk scenes"", such as the Black Knight-White knight mace fight on horseback. The scene was unnecessary, and coupled with the many other scenes took an adventure story and turned it into a drawn-out sequence of events that never seem to end. The Mock-turtle scene was, in my mind, an insult to Gene Wilder's talent, and to see his turtle-shell costume crumple up (destroying the illusion of a turtle) as he tried to get off the floor was tedious to watch and it made me think the producer was asleep or drunk in not catching this error. I would expect to see such an error in a grade-school play but not in a movie with high-talent actors.  Sometimes I think maybe the Ghost of Ed Woods was present during the producing of this film.

1014521,5,6305372837,"My, my, my.  Whenever someone asks me what my favorite movies are, I always hesitate to make a full list, because it constantly seems to change as I watch and discover new films, but for years now, Alice in Wonderland (1999) has always remained on top as my favorite film of all time.  Whatever could be so especial about yet another movie version of the beloved, classic Lewis Carroll masterpiece novel?  Well, that can simply be answered by what was a marvelous combination of an all-star cast, a smooth and appealing flow of wonderful storytelling, soft yet intelligent elements of classic humor, charm and amazing visuals and special effects.

This amazingly colorful film is not your classic re-telling of the story, in this film, there's more to the plot than a simple ride through the timeless world of Wonderland, this time around, there are lessons to be learned and a goal to achieve.  The story begins when Alice of a high class victorian family struggles when expected to publicly perform the song ""Cherry Ripe"" in front of odd strangers.  Alice decides to run away until everyone is gone and she can safely return to her home, it is then that Alice is surprised by the appearance of a strange looking white rabbit.  Like in all other versions of this tale, Alice's cuorisity will not let her sit still, instead she decides to follow the white rabbit into its rabbit hole and what a hole it was!  Alice falls and falls in what seems like an endless vertical tunnel until she arrives in the mysterious Wonderland.  From this point until the end of the journey, Alice meets all kinds of interesting characters, all of them with the intention to teach Alice to be brave, to face her troubles and that performing is something to have fun doing, not dread.

One of the most amazing thing about this film is the fact that every character is played by an amazing actor or actress, there are no dull performances therefore no dull characters.  Every one here is a filled with personality and humor and I can guarrantee none of them is bound to let their screentime go to waste or go by as unmemorable.  The young Tina Majorino (Waterworld, 1995) may not have had many screen appearances prior to this one, but she sure didn't let anyone down, she's simply perfect as Alice and I couldn't have thought of anyone capable of taking her place and leaving the film as great as it was.  Sure, you may argue with me and say that Alice's character is unlikeable and cold, but you put yourself in her shoes, anyone would be sure to be this way if surrounded by so much rudeness and insanity.  I can't think of any version of this tale that did not feature a somewhat short-tempered Alice.  Moving on, Miranda Richardson (Sleepy Hollow, 1999) sure was memorable as the whiny and screechy Queen of Hearts and has surely outshined any other Queen prior or after her.  Ben Kingsley (Schindler's List, 1993) plays the role of the wise caterpiller in what was one of the most visually pleasant scenes in the entire film. Whoopi Goldberg (Ghost, 1990), well her face was added onto the odd Cheshire Cat and allowed some of the best comic relief available, Martin Short (Mars Attacks!, 1996) is splendid as the Mad Hatter and George Wendt and Robbie Coltrane are perfect as the Tweedledee and Tweedledum duo.  A wonderful musical performance is given by Gene Wilder as the Mock Turtle and Peter Ustinov's voice and fantastic acting talent were given to the character of the Walrus.  Other vivid performances were given by Christopher Lloyd as the White Knight, Ken Dodd as Mr. Mouse, Simon Russell Beale as the King of Hearts, Elizabeth Spriggs as the Dutchess and Pete Postlethwaite as the Carpenter.

Alice in Wonderland (1999) is so visually wonderful it is hard to believe the producers aimed as a television production rather than a full-blown theatrical musical.  Still, for a TV movie, Alice in Wonderland, in my opinion, surpasses all standards.  The film is filled with glorious colors, breathtaking and realistic indoor/outdoor sets and state-of-the art special effects.  The film is amazingly detailed with many out-of-center gags and many different things a viewer will miss if the film is only viewed once.  The only thing that concerned me was the white rabbit, he was such an obvious animatronic I wasn't sure if it had been purposely made this way for appeal or was just unintentional.  Other than that, each of the scenes and sceneries did not stop amazing me after two hours of splendid viewing.

Hallmark's Alice in Wonderland is such a long movie, you can't help but feel a little sad when the whole thing is over, that's why this is the only version of Alice that has ever had me almost crying by the time the end was reached.  The scene in which the giant apple falls on the King's trial court and everything collapses leading Alice to waking up always gets me teary eyed and is probably my favorite scene in the entire film.  I was indeed sad when the film reached its finale because I had grown so fond of all of the characters for as I said before, not one of them felt flat or unappealing.  Something important I forgot to mention was the lovely soundtrack by Richard Hartley which deliciously caresses each one of the many different scenes.  The soundtrack alone was another winner on its own.

It is sad that so many people have thought of this film as atrocious, perhaps many of them failed to find its true heart and beauty.  I myself cannot see a moment in which Alice in Wonderland (1999) will ever stop being my favorite film of all time.  For no other film has ever given me such a sense of imagination and peace.  Films like this are no longer appreciated or even made nowadays which is a true shame.  I'll recommend this film to anyone who is willing to see a beautiful version of this beloved classic.  Possibly, the greatest adaptation to have ever been produced.  Ten out of ten stars.",1088380800,,5911,4.6663452266152365
1014522,1,6305372837,"I got this in a cereal box for free, which I'm grateful for, but I wish I hadn't watched it. It's everything you'd expect of a modern re-telling of this story with Hollywood comedians and actors. They make the first mistake of having an American Alice attempt a British accent. Secondly, she's had to perform a song, and the story is revealed to be only a result of a dream she's had, like Dorothy. They've penned a couple of wretched, unmemorable songs. A constantly blinking rabbit runs around and seems to have made no contribution. It's cold and lifeless, except for its set design, but it's still not much to look at. It's the Tim Burton excuse of creative style over substance, but Tim Burton movies have something to add.
The actors don't even seem to want to act against the other actors and the camera and costumes ensure you never see them express body language. The camera uses many closeups and quickly cut away from what you want to see, assuming you're already bored, the backgrounds are either blandly digital or miniatures. It's claustrophobic, suffocating and irritating to watch.
Whoopi Goldberg and Martin Short are two examples of inspired casting. Goldberg plays herself as a grinning Chesire cat, Short plays the Mad Hatter as a kind of gay socialite Austin Powers, which I can accept in this rendition but it doesn't totally work. There's no wonder to any of it and all the added-for-tv wacky dialogue just seems to get further and further away from what worked about the book - which was more and it deserves a much better film version. This never came together and when Miranda Richardson was onscreen to play croquet the whole thing just dies and the only thing keeping it going is its set pieces. There was nothing going for this in the first place, so just avoid it.",1077321600,5,1794,4.680379746835443

1014526,4,6305372837,"Alice in Wonderland takes us on a star studded trip down the rabbit hole for another classic interpritation of the land with zany locations and completly zany inhabitants.
  Alice (Tina Majorino) is dreading her part in her parents tea party. She has to sing in front of everybody! ""How do they expect me to sing in front of all these strangers?"". Alice decides to hide in the back garden until the party ends. Just then, as an apple slowly falls from a nearby tree, Alice's spots a white rabbit running along yelling ""Oh I'm so very LATE!"". She pursues him all the way down his rabbit hole full of strange objects defying gravity, until she lands in an underground world known as Wonderland. She sets out to find a beautiful garden (She couldn't get to it because she was to big to fit through the door leading to it). She keeps changing sizes going up to 10 feet high then down to ten inches high. As she wonders through the land she meets the strangest people including: Major Catapillar (Ben Kingsley) who tends to smoke his hooka, and, to Alice's annoyance, talks in very short sentences; the Duchess (Elizebeth Spriggs) who manages to ignore the air in her house filled thick with pepper; the Chesire Cat (Whoopi Goldberg) who seems to be the sainest creature around; the Mad Hatter (Martain Short) who has a tendency to break into song when unexpected; the Queen of Hearts (Miranda Richardson) who owns the garden and has hobbys of playing Crouquet and screeching ""Off with her head!""; the Mock Turtle (Gene Wilder) who sings, tells storys, and burst into tears regularly; the White Knight (Christopher Lloyd) who loves riding his horse even if he can't stay on it for long; and Tweedle Dee (George Wendt) and his brother Tweedle Dum (Robbie Coltrane) who love reciting poetry. All these characters and more help Alice to ultimatley gain confidence to sing her song, but now the question is, how will she escape this upsidown world?
  This version of Alice is a magnificent feast for the eyes and ears. Originaly made as a three hour special for NBC in 1999, the transfer to DVD is magnificent, even if much can't be said for the special features. There are a few behind the scenes things to read over, cast bios, original drawings from the Lewis Carrol book, and a trailer for the video. That's really it though.
  The effects in the movie, are however, amazing. Many of the odd creatures were created by the Jim Henson Creature Shop and they have used their talent to do an amazing job. Dyson Lovell, Robert Halmi, Sr., and Rober Halmi Jr. have done a wonderful job bringing the story to life with its chaotic yet storybook like settings and zany character looks.
  Even though this version combines elements from both of Carrol's books (Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There), and even though it strays a little from the original plot (Well, doesn't every version?) it is still a wonderful work of imagination and wonder and I would put it up there along with the Disney version.

This was probably done to create some kind of coherent storyline. Something many movie adaptions of Alice tend to do because let's face it, a movie tells a quite different kind of story than a book does.
Anyway, this interpretation is sure to include certain scenes that will satisfy most people (even the purists). My own favorite is without a doubt the tea party with an over-the-top performance from the underestimated Martin Short. Bravo! This scene, and the effort and hard work in bringing this complicated story to life earns this tv movie 4 stars in my book. But this is definetly not THE definitive version of Alice.

Calling this film anything less than butchery is a travesty.  NBC's Alice in Wonderland manages to turn Caroll's story into the very thing that it mocked.
The Alice books were meant to poke fun at authority and morals.  They were imaginative and surreal adventures that mocked authoritarian morals.  The first book asked the question ""who am I?"" while the second asked ""do I exist?""  But if you are looking for any of the spirit or physcology of the books, you will be sorely disapointed.  NBC's Alice in Wonderland opens with young Alice afraid to sing in front of her parents guests.  She then has a dream of wonderland which gives her the courage to sing at the part.  That's about it.  All the mystery and magic of the books have been dumbed down into some simplistic quest to build the courage to sing at a tea party.  The Alice books joyfully mocked such idiotic moralls.  It's obvious that the writers of NBC's Alice in Wonderland never understood the books and by adding such a simplistic meaning to them they have destroyed everthing that they stood for.
The production NBC's Alice in Wonderland are both excellent and terrible.  It's obvious alot of work and money went into this film so it's amazing that it falls so flat.  One would think that with so much money the makers could actually make all the animal characters look like animals.  Unfortunatly, the vast majority of the creatures in this film are just actors in cheap animal suits.  It brings to mind the awful British versions of the story.  The Walruse is just a fat guy with a mustache shaped like tusks.  The cards are just guys in cheap card suits.  With such a large budget there is simply no excuse for this.  The sets for the most part are beautiful and very well put together.  It comes as a suprise then that most of the scenes are not the least bit surreal.  Most tend to drag out and are fairly boring.  NBC should really hire a director who translate the dreamy atmosphere of the books.  Tim Burton anyone?
Finally we get to the cast.  It's amazing how many talented individuals deliver such mediocre performances.  With the exception of Mirandra Richardson as the queen of hearts, the entire cast is simply awful in their respective roles.  Worst is Alice who is very placid and un-engaging.

After seeing this new version I have made a resolution never to critisize the Disney version again.  Sure it was simplistic are cartoony but at least it kept some of the spirit of the books and didn't denegrate them as this version has done.  It also managed to keep much of the surreal atmosphere of the origional.  NBC's Alice in Wonderland is simply a travesty that should only be viewed for people wanting to see just how wrong an adaptation can go.",1011398400,11,2899,4.616438356164384

This time around we have Whoppi Goldberg as the Chesire Cat, Martin Short as the Mad Hatter, Christopher Lloyd as the White Knight, Ben Kingsley as the Caterpiller and Miranda Richardson as the Red Queen!

1014585,5,6305372837,"Unlike the vapid and cloying confections of Disney and Hollywood, this version of the Reverend Dodgeson's tale does not assume that its audience is mentally retarded.  Instead, it operates on many layers simultaneously, so that a three year old can watch captivated while its parent can enjoy the allusions and subtlety.  The under-fives may not catch the Oxford-Cambridge rivalry that surfaces in the Red Queen's courtroom, but they will enjoy the Hatter's impromptu rendition of ""Twinkle Twinkle"" while accompanied by the March Hare on banjo. In this rare case, the cliche of ""something for everyone"" is actually true.
The acting is of a superior quality and there are some amusing vignettes, particularly from Gene Wilder as the Mock Turtle, who duets with Donald Sinden's Griffin (and ignores the interjected elocution lesson).  The special effects are additive rather than scene-stealing, which is how it should be.  Although Whoopi Goldberg's name is employed to market this video in the USA, her role is in fact quite slender and one of the least successful.  This video should be purchased for its wit and elegance rather than because one expects to see one's favorite Hollywood stars in cameo roles.
In conclusion, this is a delightful production of taste and charm, quite unlike the sterile and mind-numbing fare that issues from North America.  Watch it and enjoy - and then think how much more interesting and exuberant life would be if Disney and Hollywood should cease to exist, replaced instead by the likes of those who bring us this modern-day enchantment of Alice in her wonderland.",999475200,3,1600,5.111111111111111
1014586,3,6305372837,"I expected it to be really fun. It was kind of difficult to understand. I think the cookie and mushroom parts were little bit interesting. But, the race? It was rather stupid. I mean, there's people running all around the 'room' and there's no end, no beginning. It's kind of funny where the Queen keeps on shouting, ""OFFF WITH HER HEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Alice was a so-so person.
I think adults would like this movie. It was rather dull and uninteresting in some parts, especially the race. After you finish, it leaves an dull space in your stomach. Other movies with Woopi Goldberg such as ""Cinderella"" is much more fun. I mean, she just grins,grins, and grins as the Chester Cat.",999216000,,678,4.705882352941177
1014587,3,6305372837,"This version of the classic by Lewis Carroll sets Alice as getting ready to sing in front of strangers and because she dreads this, she escapes to Wonderland and so on... A nice take on the classic tale although the order of events is completely messed up. The definitive version of Alice has to be the 1985 mini-series version now available on two seperate videos.
This movie is full of humour thanks to Martin Short and Whoopie Goldberg (Everyone is mad here...) and must say that Miranda Richardson was not quite the Queen of Hearts I expected, with her very high and intolerable shrieky voice. But other than that, it is pure fun from beginning to end. The songs aren't exceptionnal but it is a nice contemporary take on the timeless tale.
I still like this movie because any rendition of Lewis Carroll's stories drives me MAD!",997401600,,831,4.659863945578231
1014631,5,6305372837,One of the realist quotes I heard was in this movie when Alice in Wonderland said its rude to make personal comments. I advice u to consider investing sometime in watching this movie if u have a lot of spare time.,993340800,,213,4.219512195121951
1014632,3,6305372837,"Well, certain elements of the book are missing. Nevertheless, this is a delightful way to spend a lazy afternoon. The scenery is beautiful and the effects are done well; the characters (especially Short, Wilder, and Ustinov) are convincing. Even though the movie does get silly at times, it is never boring. Even if you never read the book, you should watch this. You may be pleasantly surprised.",984528000,2,396,4.925373134328358
1014633,1,6305372837,"This is one of the worst renditions of Alice in Wonderland I have ever seen.  While I really wanted to enjoy the film's high production values I couldn't becuase everything else was so poorly done.
To begin with the film really gets tedious.  While the sets are very elaberate the direction is simply boring.  Who ever directed this really needs to polish their technique.  Scenes are flat rather than sureal and they tend to really drag.
Worse are the characters.  Half are brilliantly re-created by Jim Henson's creature shop.  Unfortunatly the other half are just actors attempting to act like animals.  The birds from the Cacus race have become a bunch of old people.  Phil the lizard is know an Irish man.  While this film has an excellent cast, they all manage to give lousy performances.  Their acting is so over-the-top that it stops being funny or amusing and instead is just irritating.  Alice is simply awful.
However, even the flaws mentioned above don't explain the true problem of the movie.  The origional Alice in Wonderland(and Through the Looking Glass) didn't have any real moral to it.  It can be interpreted in many ways but it is anything but simple.  The film, rather inserts a moral that was never in the book.  The movie begins with Alice frightend because here parents want her to sing in front of a bunch of guests.  Becuase of this, the whole film turns into a simplistic story of Alice trying to find her courage.  Just about every scene from the book has been distorted and characters are constantly telling Alice ""The show must go on!"" or ""You must sing.""  The fact that the writers had the audacity to think they knew Lewis Carrol's novel better then he did is plain ludicrous.
If you want to know what Alice in Wonderland or Alice Through the Looking Glass was like, read the books.  If you're not up to that then see the Disney movie.  Just don't watch this travisty of a film.",983664000,6,1911,4.630952380952381
1014634,2,6305372837,Everything was fine until we got to scene 7.  Scenes 7-14 were missing - completely!  I assume this was probably an error in the manufacturing for this particular batch (the replacement dvd I got did the same) which is why no-one else has commented on this happening.,971395200,,267,4.659574468085107
1014635,4,6305372837,"In 1999, NBC broadcast a new version of Alice in Wonderland, created by the same folks who produced Gulliver's Travels, Merlin, and Noah's Ark.  This star-studded version had Tina Majorino (from Waterworld) as a winsome Alice, and other stars like Whoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat, Miranda Richardson (Crying Game) as a rather high-pitched, shrill Queen of Hearts, and Martin Short as a very amusing Mad Hatter.  There are plenty of other stars, of course, but these are the ones you will notice the most.  This particular production is a loose adaptation, really.  It incorporates portions of both Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.  And it adds a new twist - Alice runs after the White Rabbit not out of curiosity from boredom but rather to escape from having to sing a song in front of many strangers at her parents' party.  Her adventures in Wonderland as thus partially about how she summons the courage to overcome this stage-fright, and when she does, she returns to the real world.  In the meantime, we see the usual interesting episodes in Wonderland - the Mad Tea Cup party, the croquet match, Twiddledee and Twiddledum, the trial of tarts, the Duchess and her baby pig and cheshire cat, etc.  There are even a few songs scattered here and there in the film - the songs, for the most part, are nothing special but they do not distract much from the movie (some folks may also remember a 4-hour TV miniseries on the Alice books, filled with songs, from the 1980s; this was also star-studded and probably more faithful to the books but the songs were annoying).
The best thing about this new Alice film are the special effects.  They are amazing and create a most bizarre, surreal, and colorful version of Wonderland.  This makes the film great fun to look at.  Also, Tina Majorino does a great job as Alice, and we really grow to really like her and sympathize for her as the film progresses.  Martin Short, as I mentioned, is pretty funny, too.  This is definitely a film the whole family can enjoy, and there is nothing offensive in the film at all.  If you liked this film when you first saw it on TV, purchase it!  I did!  Currently, it sells for less than 10 dollars on some internet sites!  Quite a bargain.
Finally, just a few words on the DVD itself.  The colors are superb and the picture quality is clear and outstanding.  Sound quality is quite good - it won't give the subwoofers any workout, but nonetheless, it sounds very good for a TV broadcast.  Extras on the disc include the usual suspects - film production notes, cast notes, trailer, close captioning (instead of subtitles).  There is also a small section showing the original illustrations of the Alice books, and lastly, a small section about the inspiration for the Alice books (quite informative for those who do not know about the real-life inspiration for Alice).
So, all in all, the DVD is worth the purchase and makes for many fun re-watching sessions for the kids.  A good family recommendation!",970704000,35,3003,4.701720841300191
1014636,2,6305372837,"When I heard that Alice in Wonderland was going to be made into a miniseries I was really excited because Alice in Wonderland has been my favorite book since the fourth grade. Unfortuntly I was disapointed with  this movie version of Carroll's classic novel. It combines elements of both  Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which doesn't really  bother me since most movie versions do anyway. The special effects were  good and the acting was decent but the film ultimitly was very draggy and  lackluster, disappointingly forgettable. Probably one of my largest  complaints against it would be the inclusion of the singing recital scene.  Carroll's book has become famous for being the first children's book  written without any sort of morales or lessons. Thats the whole point of  the book in fact, the most disturbing element, the fact that there is no  reason why Alice has suddenly been dropped into this chaotic and weird  world. Unfortuntly, the makers of this movie missed the point entirely and  decided to put a cute little lesson for Alice to learn into the film and a  reason for going to Wonderland. The wonderland and Looking Glass characters  in the book were rather uncaring and sometimes hostile toward Alice(except  for the white knight)They weren't just there to help her combat stage  fright! There has never been a decent film version of Alice and there  probably never will. Although this wasn't all it was hyped to be it is  however, preferable to the disney cartoon.",958867200,26,1506,4.932270916334661

1014715,2,6305372837,"I had seen this version when it was shown on television last year. Despite a very talented cast and some very top notch special effects for a made for television movie, there were too many changes to the story that left me  feeling terribly hollow afterwards. I don't know why the production team  had to make such a drastic change to the beginning of the story. The fact  they had to change the opening from Alice's sister reading to her to Alice  preparing to sing for some recital just didn't set well with me. The girl  they chose to play Alice did an exceptional job despite the weak script and  one of highlights in the movie for me was Gene Wilder as the Mock Turtle.  It was so nice to see him on the screen again after such a long time. I  just hope in the future if Hollywood wants to do a production like this,  they will stay true to the original story.",952300800,7,865,4.225609756097561

It sticks as closely to the book as possible and avoids cutting out the last half of the whole story, unlike most modern versions. The cast is incredible, the best as a whole that I can see for Alice in Wonderland. There are not just one or two big stars, but a multitude, including the late Gene Wilder, that make this story very fun and colorful. I recommend this movie to anyone, my son and I absolutely ADORE IT!!
