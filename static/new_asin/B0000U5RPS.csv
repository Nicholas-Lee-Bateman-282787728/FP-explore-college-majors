8305266,3,B0000U5RPS,"I had high hopes for Candida Royalle's Femme films - it takes more than crotch shots and gargantuan breasts to get my attention. I do like a bit of smut, but I also like some romance - sensuality.

The quality was lower than I expected, making this movie seem cheap. It was kind of cheesy, had a couple of decent scenes, but nothing really memorable (as in, this will be staying in the back of my video drawer, most likely.)

One good thing: The male actor, ""Robert"", was attractive. I usually don't find men that appealing in these kinds of movies - okay - porn. But he was actually good-looking, in my own opinion.

I wouldn't suggest this film. If you're into stuff more softcore, try one of Playboy's fantasies films. Sensual, with decent amouts of nudity. I actually really like Playboy.",1286496000,,792,4.563380281690141
