8543107,5,B009NNHPC6,"Absolutely incredible! The creators ""knocked it out the park"" with Star Blazers 2199. Star Blazers 2199 covers the gaps, answer questions, and eliminates wasteful episodes (Balanosaurus/Magnetron Wave) from the original series. I didn't think it was possible, but Desslok is even more ruthless than before and Lysis, long thought to be a fanatic,is portrayed in a different light. A MUST buy for all Star Blazer fans.",1468540800,,417,5.333333333333333

8543111,5,B009NNHPC6,"I grew up watching this cartoon in the 70's.  I even got my kids to watch the original version.  Found out about this and WOW!  They did a great job all the way from the animation, music, new characters, plot.

If your a Starblazers buff you will not be disappointed.

I only hope that when Voyager entertainment comes out with the Starblazers 2199 they use the original voices.",1384300800,,378,4.5
8543112,5,B009NNHPC6,"This is the best DVD from the set yet. During the episodes in it we have Yuri and Kodai dealing with the so called ghost of the Yamato (learning her secret),  like 1970s series has Shima and Kodai (Mark Venture and Darek Wildstar) get into a fight and end up scrubbing decks of the ship but with a modern twist to it.  We have Kodai arguing for the rights of the Gamelion they have aboard.  While unlike the 1970s the Yamato may not use the asteroid ring defense system they do use an asteroid belt to hide from the Gamelion during a battle with them. This DVD also focus on life on Gamelion home planet and what their families are like. While I expected a slip cover for vol 5 was surprise to get one for vol. 4.  Shame that since the producer of original 1970s Space Battleship Yamato died in 2010 he probably never got to see this wonderful new version come to life.",1368835200,,869,4.248484848484848
