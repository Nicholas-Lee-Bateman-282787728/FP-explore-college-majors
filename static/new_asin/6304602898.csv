901966,5,6304602898,"The film is a classic, and rediscovering it recently has been an awakening of sorts (Ive always been iffy on dark humor but now I fully embrace it). It has heart, and at times ridiculous, which makes it all the more enjoyable.

Only complaint was that the first disc I got was defective (it skipped the playback within certain scenes) and had to be replaced. Thankfully I got a full refund at the time (due to the holidays) and used it to buy a new one that played perfectly.",1514851200,,475,4.337078651685394
901967,5,6304602898,"Great movie that still holds up 30 years later. I showed this to my 10 year old, who is starting to get into horror. It is such a clever movie, with a great balance of humor and horror. I was laughing, my 10 year old was fascinated, and my 9 year old couldn't watch because it was too scary for her. That's the kind of range it has. It's worth owning, and a must-have for any kid, especially ones who want to be thrilled.",1514764800,,421,4.023809523809524
901968,5,6304602898,Can't go wrong with the ultimate Christmas movie!  I introduced this movie to my daughter (as I saw the original run back in the 80's).  It was just as good today!,1514505600,,163,4.225806451612903
901969,4,6304602898,"This witty, complex movie is filled with send ups from the classic stories of Christmas -- good and bad. As Roger Ebert wrote, "" a meditation on the myths in our movies: Christmas, families, monsters, retail stores, movies, boogeymen. At the level of Pop Movie-going, it's a sophisticated, witty B movie, in which the monsters are devouring not only the defenseless town, but decades of defenseless clich&eacute;s.""

I enjoyed the first half more than the noisy, chaotic second half -- but the child in me loves it all.

Even the stereotypes -- Mother in Defense -- ""Not in MY kitchen.""

Not your typical Christmas movie, but every few years worth watching again to remember how it was.

901970,5,6304602898,"There are already more than 3,800 reviews so this will be short.  I watched this with our 9 year old because she got something called a Feisty Pet for Christmas.  The toy reminded me of Gremlins and that she had not seen the movie.  She says the movie is really good and that the Feisty Pet designer(s) must have seen the movie.

One of the interesting things is that in addition to the actors playing the main characters, this movie features a number of faces recognizable as old time actors.  These include Kenneth Toby, Scott Brady and Harry Carey, Jr.  There were others whose names I could not recall.

We streamed the movie via Amazon rental with no problems.",1513900800,,665,4.53781512605042
902068,5,6304602898,"Every time I watch this movie it just takes me back to my youth.  I can remember seeing this in theaters when I was younger and it stayed in my memories a good amount.  Several years later I bought it on VHS and everything that I loved about it as I kid plus the many things that I actually forgot about all got me to step back in time to the 80's.  Since then I watched it a bunch of times more and later on more times on DVD.

This movie is for all ages and for me it never gets old.  I find that every time I watch this movie I always catch something new going on in the movie that I never noticed before.  This movie packs quite a wallop whatwith this movie being a hilarious and sort of scary movie, the Gremlin monsters are  really menacing and awesome, the score/soundtrack is classic and just excellent, It's during Christmas time that all the horror, mayhem, and hilarity takes place, young actors and classic actors are both in the movie, finally it's from the 80's making it both nostalgic and showcasing the great awesomeness of the era.

Some Facts About the Film:  It was directed by Joe Dante and produced by by Michael Finnell.  It was written by Chris Columbus.  The musical score was by the late great Jerry Goldsmith. Among some of the notable stars are Zach Galligan(Hatchet III, Cyborg 3, Waxwork 1&2), Phoebe Cates(Fast Times at Rigdemont High, Princess Caraboo, Bright Lights Big City), Polly Holliday(Tv's Alice), Glynn Turman(TV's A Different World, The Inkwell) and Judge Reinhold(Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Head Office, Vice Versa)  The cinematography was by John Hora.  The Gremlins and Mogwais were created by Chris Walas.  The production company for the film was Amblin Entertainment.  It was distributed by Warner Bros.  The theatrical release date for the film was June 8, 1984.  The budget was $11 million dollars.  Finally the movie grossed $153.1 million dollars.

I just love the creature design for the Gremlins and the Mogwais by Chris Walas.  True the animatronics movements proved a bit stiff at times but at that time I had never seen such awesome and campy puppets before.  Not only was Gizmo cute and lovable but the other Mogwai were semi-cute and menacing to say nothing for the Gremlins especially Stripe which proved to be menacing and ruthless yet strangely cute themselves.  The movements for them were excellent for the most part.  What makes the Gremlins particularly evil and vicious and still hilarious and fun is how they emulate and poke fun at some many cliche' things that humans do.

About the humor, a couple of my favorite funny moments would definitely be for example:  All the hysterical things that they were doing in Dorry's Tavern including the one Gremlin wearing sweat clothes and legwarmers while break-dancing.  Another would be the scene where Stripe gets angry with the card dealer Gremlin and shoots him.  Or even the teasing Gremlin with the puppets on his hands annoying the Gremlin with the hat to the point of him hitting the Gremlin with the puppets in the head with a mallet.  As violent and rough as those couple of scenes might sound they were done in a bloodless and campy Looney Tunes and Three Stooges slapstick style.  That is just to name a few gutbuster hilarious moments.

Both the score by the late great Jerry Goldsmith and the songs on the soundtrack are excellent.  Jerry Goldsmith was always one of my top favorite film score composers and his work with this movie was among some of his greatest work ever.  His music here carries a lovely 80's vibe with it of course but also his melodies are very infectious and have an indelible earworm element to them as you are likely to be humming his tunes anywhere at any time plus they just plain stay in your head in general.  For the purpose of the movie Jerry comes up with not just the perfect moodset and emotion to go with the scenes but he goes from mellow, feelgood, and relaxing all the way to freaky and menacing without missing a beat.  As for the soundtrack well that included Michael Sembello(well-known for Maniac from the Flashdance soundtrack), Peter Gabriel, and Quaterflash.  While they were the only popular pop artists at the time doing only one song a piece on the soundtrack Their songs are still alot of awesome and fun classic 80's tunes.  Being a huge fan of all 3 artists their presence on this album proved completely welcome by me.

Joe Dante certainly has proven himself quite a great director when he did other great movies such as The Howling, Explorers(another of my  fond childhood memories), and The Burbs.  I have always enjoyed Dante's elements of humor, horror, weirdness, and at times sex appeal that his movies have often showcased.

I am highly impressed with John Hora's cinematography in this movie.  The interiors of the houses and public places are well shot and well edited both.  Just enough lighting, relatable looking house interiors, recognizable building interiors, and moody colors and shapes make for some excellent shots as well.  There's not alot to say about the exterior shots except that only as much as you need to see of the outside is shown.  Particularly when you get to see that the fictional town of Kingston Falls looks very much like a common Southern or Midwestern small town.

Most of the actors did a good at least decent job.  Corey Feldman was good as Pete.  Hoyt Axton was likable and believable as Rand Peltzer.  Phoebe Cates did an okay Job as Kate though it was a huge switch from her usually sexy roles to a squeaky clean small town girl.  Judge Reinhold was obnoxious yet quite funny as Jerold. Classic B-movie actor Dick Miller was tongue in cheek funny as Murray Futterman.  Polly Holliday was sensational as the vile and nasty b**** of a landlady Mrs. Ruby Deagle; she was also funny.  No complaints about anyone else with the exception of Zach Galligan.  His acting was horrendous then and to this day his acting is still ghastly.  He was a really poor choice as Billy and if he had been more focused on then the monsters he would have seriously ruined the whole movie.

Overall, if you love 80's horror, Christmas horror,  80's comedy, little monster movies involving the little monsters wreaking havoc such as Critters, Munchies, The Gate, or Ghoulies, love great 80's music, good camp, want something that even children can watch, good animatronics, and you enjoy references made to older actors and movies well then this movie is a must see.  After 33 years this movie still delivers on the horror and laughs!  10 stars out of 10!!",1513641600,,6553,4.704126426690079

Really glad I received considering media mail is for educational material only and had inspectors opened it would have been sent back. Not many ppl are aware of that I only know because My wife is a postal employee.

As for the packaging it was very very very will wrapped which I am extremely fearful for considering this is going to be a collector item.

It was received as pictured sealed in original packaging it was in very good new condition.

Thank you so much for the great car of the item.",1513209600,,603,4.414414414414415

You know what you're going to get before you see it (especially since its popularity placed a lot of the concepts into pop culture), but I will just say that on a technical level, the puppeteering and other special effects are truly amazing. Personally, I prefer practical effects to CG, especially for major effects, and Gremlins is a real tour de force in the regard. I saw this film a bunch when I was younger, but now I watch it with a pretty high respect for the technical work involved.

I was freakin four.  This only solidified my love for it, as stupid as some aspects are (ever read the original screenplay?  Nasty stuff!).  Never will the CG they use today look as real as the gremlins do in this film, even when you can see how fake they are.  If you've never seen this movie, watch it for the creature feature it is.  It's a good time, but really it's more PG-13 than PG...but that rating was very rarely used back then, like Ghostbusters or Poltergeist (the originals not the remake crap).",1483401600,,676,4.2421875

However, my husband painted it as a fun movie, so I decided to give it a try for nostalgia's sake, since so many of my teenage icons have been dying this year.  I could have died in peace without having watched it.  The pacing was agonizingly slow, even for a 1980's movie.  I joked with my kids that back when I was a kid, we had more patience, but this movie tested even my patience.  The lead actor seemed to be on Quaaludes most of the time, as well as Hoyt Axton and several others.  And the original gremlin, Mogwai, is rather creepy looking, even though they tried to make him cute.  And I suspect that he inspired Furby toy designs, which is another reason to dislike it.  There were a few funny parts, like the bar scene with the gremlins, but they were too infrequent and overwhelmed by gross scenes and the nasty scenes and the long,drawn out rising action, especially the fight scene in the hardware store.",1482883200,,1000,4.310160427807487

The acting is fun and the scenes are gruesome but the audience take the vigilante role to arrest the ill-behavior of the multitudes of Grimlins.

912177,5,6304602898,"I introduced my grandson to this movie last night, and he loved it! Like all of us who originally saw the movie in the theaters when it was released, he fell in love with Gizmo, hated Striped and his ultimate large gang of buddies, and loved the bar and movie scenes. I had not watched the movie in years and while it seemed ""tamer"" than when I had first watched it, ""Gremlins"" is still a good time.

After he went to bed, I checked out the additional features in this Special Edition. There were stills with printed information, but I found the best parts are contained in the commentaries. I watched one with Director Joe Dante, cast members Zach Gilligan, Phoebe Cates, and Dick Miller, and Howie Mandel (voice of Gizmo). This was one of the most entertaining commentaries I had ever listened to. Many stories were recounted, and the five of them had a good time joking back and forth.

Definitely a lot of fun on one disc.",1480118400,,926,4.4733727810650885

914068,5,6304602898,"Great  movie.  I  think  though  there  is  one  thing  Steven Spielberg  hasn't  thought  of.  I  wonder  what  it  would  be  like  if  they  didn't  eat  after  midnight,  if  they  had  stayed  furry.  &  the  same  size  as  Gizmo.  I'd  love  to  see  them  wreak  havoc.  Or  get  into  mischief.  I  like  them  better  when  they're  like  Gizmo.  Its  Christmas  &  Mr  Peltzer  (Hoyt Axton)  is  out  Christmas  shopping  looking  for  a  present  for  his  son.  He's  an  inventor.  I  don't  think  he  was  trying  to  strike  up  a  deal  with  the  china  man  &  his  grandson  nor  trying  to  bribe  them.  He  didn't  seem  too  interested  in  his  inventions  anyhow.  Perhaps  there  was  a  time  when  the  Chinese  man  had  of  sold  the  Mogwai  Gizmo,  &  things  went  wrong,  now  he  won't  sell  it  to  anyone.  That's  probably  what  happened.  Peltzer  hears  humming.  &  goes  to  check  it  out.  The  Chinese  man  won't  sell  because  he  is  well  aware  that  folks  are  not  reliable  enough  for  the  results  if  they  do  not  follow  the  rules.  Little  green  men  can  multiply  from  getting  wet  &  start  going  crazy  terrifying  people  through  the  neighborhoods  or  wherever.
Now  the  grandson  watching  his  grandpa  walk  away  claims  he  is  stubborn  &  just  old.  So  he  waits  a  few  minutes  then  brings  out  the  little  box  with  Gizmo.
Because  Gizmo  needed  air  to  breath  He  insists  to  his  son  Billy  (Zach Galligan)  that  he  opens  it  up  now  &  not  wait  until  Christmas.  A  few  days  go  by,  all  seems  normal  as  Billy  enjoys  the  company  of  his  new  pet  aside  from  his  dog  Barney.  But  when  his  neighbor  Pete  (Cory Feldman)  comes  over  to  hang  out  he  asks  if  he  can  hold  Gizmo  &  accidentally  knocks  over  a  jar  of  water  Billy  had  used  to  rinse  his  paintbrushes  in.  Gizmo  is  screaming  as  he  wiggles  around  the  floor  acting  like  he's  in  real  pain.  Gizmo  I  suppose  is  actually  the  smartest  one  when  it  comes  to  an  understanding  about  gremlins  &  everything  that  goes  on  with  them.  He  knows  by  instinct.  &  yes  Mr  Peltzer  I'm  sure  every  kid  in  America  would  like  to  have  a  furry  little  creature  like  Gizmo.  By  the  way  would  you  still  call  that  a  gremlin  or  only  for  the  way  they  look  after  eating  after  midnight?  They'd  probably  make  a  mistake  somewhere  down  the  line  if  everyone  did  own  one  of  those  things.  1.  Keep  them  out  of  light  &  for  sure  sunlight.  2. No  water, baths,  or  none  to  drink.  3.  Don't  ever  feed  them  after  midnight.  &  after  the  first  half  hour  of  the  movie  that's  what  happens.  Billy's  clock  had  gotten  damaged.  It  was  plugged  in  by  the  wires  looked  they  had  been  chewed  on,  perhaps  by  Barney  or  the  gremlins.  He  looks  at  the  clock  &  then  goes  to  get  them  some  leftover  chicken.
Check  out  something  really  funny,  take  a  look  at  the  gremlins  when  they're  laughing,  like  they  were  when  they  drove  a  loader  through  Mr  Futterman's  home.  That  was  funny.  They  love  to  party  &  tare  up  the  town.  Probably  the  silliest  part  of  the  show  is  when  the  some  of  the  gremlins  visit  the  bar  where  Kate  works.
Some  of  the  gremlins  wearing  the  dark  sunglasses  looking  like  gangsters,  &  them  drinking  the  beer  didn't  seem  to  make  them  multiply  at  all.  What  I  laughed  at  was  when  Kate  took  a  picture  of  the  gremlins  with  her  camera  because  it  had  a  bright  flash  when  she  learned  they  were  afraid  of  bright  light.
They  finish  off  the  huge  crowd  with  a  gas  explosion  in  the  movie  theater,
&  chase  the  leader  with  the  white  stripe  to  a  sports  store,  &  it  is  Gizmo  who  saves  the  day  by  pulling  on  a  rope  &  exposing  the  bright  light.  Rand  Peltzer  (Hoyt Axton)  never  did  get  a  good  look  at  meaner  gremlins.  So  he  doesn't  take  part  in  too  much  of  the  action  throughout  the  movie.  Just  handles  his  fancy  looking  inventions,  meets  with  people  on  business  showing  them  his  inventions.  As  well  as  explaining  the  rules  to  Billy  after  bringing  Gizmo  home.
The  old  Chinese  man  appears  out  of  nowhere  being  disappointed  with  Billy's  father.  To  me  its  rude  to  enter  a  home  surprising  someone  without  knocking.
Perhaps  now  we  know  why  he  didn't  want  Rand  to  take  the  Mogwai  in  the  beginning.
The  ending  turned  out  fine.
Music  in  the  movie  is  fantastic.  I  recommend  this  movie  to  most  people,  not  everybody  because  some  people  just  can't  these  kind  of  movies.  But  please  compare  this  one  to  the  (Freddy Krueger  movies)?  This  one  here  is  what  I'd  call  a  decent  horror  movie.  Nothing  major  really.
For  the  record  the  gremlins  love  to  party  &  have  good  time.  They  don't  understand  that  somethings  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum.
They  try  to  have  a  blast  in  their  own  honor.
(Hoyt Axton)  did  a  good  job  narrating  the  beginning  &  ending  of  the  movie.",1475107200,,5278,4.372596153846154

915732,1,6304602898,"I told my daughters, 8 and 10, that this movie scared me so much as a kid I never watched it again. They thought it would be really cool to do a ""face Mom's fears"" night, and convinced me it probably wasn't *that* scary. Jokes on them, they were hiding their faces half way through the movie! I think my 8 year old is not going to let this go. As an adult, I tried to read between the lines. While my kids felt a little giddy reprieve during the bar scene, I saw a woman struggling to appease a horde of disgusting creatures blatantly acting out some of most despicable of human activities. Was that why these super intelligent creatures, who knew how to operate a stick shift moments after they were hatched, couldn't take down humanity? Because they were too enthralled by any impulse that compelled them to act like evil toddlers?  I feel like there is some big message about humanity here. And the mess, ugh. That's my new fear after watching this movie. A mess so big the best option is to simply condemn and evacuate the town. This was clearly not an enlightened time for society; those poor women were going to be sidelined into scrub duty while that big oaf of a father keeps making horrible machines that only make matters worse, not listening to warnings, and conveniently being out of town during the fallout.  If you want a peek into what second-wave feminism was so pissed off about, maybe you could include this movie in your research",1472169600,,1448,4.481060606060606

920664,4,6304602898,"This is my first revisit of this 32-year old film. It shows it age in the special effects and its treatment of a Chinese character. Otherwise, this film that defies genre, holds up. The Christmas setting, the romance, the oddball parents, and the presence of Corey Feldman create a fun ambience, especially if you're from Generation X. The ""horror"" aspect is comical and gross. This is a must-see for the pop literate. Have fun.",1463356800,,428,4.797297297297297

921786,1,6304602898,"I thought that this was going to be a funny Christmas movie with cute little furry creatures.

That is how it starts out.

But the cute little pet multiplies himself into evil little monsters called gremlins.

There really is no plot - - a 20-something year old guy named Billy who still lives with his parents gets an unusual pet from his father for Christmas.  The sweet pet multiplies himself into hundreds of creatures who - - for no reason - - want to cause damage to everything they see and kill everyone they see, until Billy manages to kill them all at the end.

There are ridiculous parts, like when Billy actually breaks a store window by banging it with a toddler's plastic toy.

There are disgusting parts, like when one of the gremlins is cooked to death in a microwave.

There are stupid parts, like where do these little creatures manage to get little outfits to wear - - one dresses up in a tiny trenchcoat and flashes people - - one dresses in a hat and sunglasses and smokes cigarettes and gets drunk - - they were just created and they already got wardrobes from nowhere.

There are weird parts, like when Billy hangs out in his bedroom with a ten year old boy (Corey Feldman).

This movie is very negative toward Christmas.  Phoebe Cates tells Billy a story about her father dressing up as Santa on Christmas Eve and dying horribly, which is how she realized that Santa is not real - - at the age of 9.  The only thing that made this a Christmas movie was that it takes place at Christmastime and there are Christmas decorations that get destroyed.

I watched this whole movie because I just had to see how it would end.

This movie was mostly disgusting, not at all scary, and too long.",1461628800,,1707,4.415335463258786

922219,4,6304602898,"This is a fun little horror movie that stood up pretty well to rewatching as an adult. I watched several times as a kid, but didn't remember a lot of what happened other than some of the more memorable action scenes (most notable the mom battling the gremlins in the kitchen). There is a lot going on in the movie, so much so that I missed out on some stuff due to not giving it 100% of my attention (like, what happened to the dog or that horrible greedy older lady). It's also amazingly gruesome and violent at times, something I think is missing from movies aimed at kids today. Or, perhaps my parents were crazy for letting me watch such ""adult"" stuff so young (I'm glad they did!).

Deducted a star for the flawed logic of the ""rules"", which kind of takes me out of the story as an adult (I remember it bothering me as a kid, too, wondering about stuff like time zones and atmospheric humidity). There's also the problematic racial issues, such as the use of the Magical Asian trope and the killing off of the only black guy in town- and that's without getting into discussion of the gremlins as the other invading white suburbia.

All in all, I'd recommend watching this movie if you want above-average 80s nostalgic fluff, great practical effects and puppetry, or if you are into analysing movies for social issues.",1461110400,,1322,4.504166666666666

922864,5,6304602898,"This movie is WONDERFUL!!! My mom bought this DVD a long time ago, and I grew up watching this. It could have used more bonus features, but I still adore it! This is, as the director put it, a ""Gremlin and his boy"" story about a young man named Billy Peltzer who's dad gives him a strange but cure little furry creature called a Mogwai that is given the name Gizmo. Mogwais have 3 special rules that you should never break: 1: Keep him out of the light. Especially Sunlight. Sunlight kills them. 2: Keep him out of the water. Don't get him wet. and the most important rule of all - 3: No matter how much he cries, no matter how much he begs - Never. EVER. Feed  him after midnight. But by accident and mischievious trickery, these rules do get broken, and results in spooky and hilarious fun for the whole family. The disc comes with 2 audio comentaries, one from the effects people and another from the director and actors Zack Gilligan (Billie Peltzer) Pheobe, the one who plays Kate, and Howie Mandel, who did the voice of Gizmo. Good for fans and people who are curious about this movie alike. Especially since there is talk of a Gremlins 3 that could be made in the near future.",1453939200,,1183,4.352941176470588

923441,2,6304602898,"Watched this with my son recently. Honestly, it is hard to believe that Spielberg produced this piece of dreck! The writing is uninspired and the characters are not only shallow but idiotic. Our ""hero"" manages to be shot in the arm by a cross-bow wielding gremlin in a sporting goods store and then is incapable of getting up off the floor? Really? And he drops his only weapon (a baseball bat) and suddenly is incapable of fighting back even as the gremlin threatens him with an electric chainsaw?
If this movie was supposed to be a combination of comedy and horror it fails badly on both accounts. The bar scene with gremlins everywhere is poorly executed, way too long, and features every stereotype possible (including a gremlin who flashes the female bartender).
If you want to save yourself and your family from the stench that is this movie, I highly recommend that you avoid this movie.",1449100800,,894,4.737179487179487

924326,5,6304602898,"This is an offbeat black comedy about a horde of little monsters (Maguey) who invade the small town of Kingston Falls. Billy Peltzer, a young man (Zach Galligan)  is fooled into breaking 3 important rules concerning this new pet, Gizmo the maguey given to him by his eccentric inventor father, Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton).  What ensues is maniacal mayhem, a ton of funny gags, some good scares and non-stop thrills.  This horror/comedy hybrid is pure fun. It is nostalgic and a treat for movie fans There is a homage to the monster movies of the 1950s, 3D movies of the 1950s, invasion scares, small town America, Snow White, and It's A Wonderful Life. Populating the supporting cast of this film is a Who's Who of 1940s & 1950s and classic tv shows and movies: Keye Luke, Scott Brady, Harry Carey, Jr., Dick Miller, Polly Holiday, Edward Andrews, Glynn Turman, Jackie Joseph, William Schallert, Robbie the Robot,  and Kenneth Tobey. Also, look for early appearances by Phoebe Cates, Judge Reinhold, Corey Feldman, and Tom Bergeron. The movie is directed by Joe Dante, a master of horror, produced by the gifted Steven Spielberg, scored by Jerry Goldsmith. Michael Sembello's Gremlins Mega Madness theme is catchy and adds to the scenes of mayhem.",1448755200,,1248,4.928571428571429

927058,4,6304602898,"While the characters of Gizmo and the various Gremlins did become iconic characters in their own right (even inspiring the Furby toy craze of the late 90's), their movie just doesn't hold up as well any more.

This movie was somewhat marketed as a kids holiday film, when it was really a dark comedy.  There's a surprisingly high body count.  And the deaths, both human and gremlins related, are treated as punchlines.  But in regards to the comedy, a lot of the jokes sort of fall flat.  Which I feel like is a failing of the editing.

The only thing that really makes this feel like a kids movie is the Gizmo character itself.  Everything else just seems aimed towards teens to young adults.

There's good reasons to attempt to make a movie with broad appeal, but I feel like this movie lost its tonal consistency when it tried to be too many things.

The main thing that kept my interest in this movie was the puppetry.  The gremlins characters were well designed, and the way that the puppeteers performed them gave them a ton of character.  And for being practical effects from the 80's, the gremlins have an actual lifelike feel to them.  While Gizmo feels like a stationary anamorphic (because he is) the gremlins feel like actual living monstrosities capable of a full range of movement.  And they are some of the best realized puppets I've ever seen.

Special mention goes to the films score.  It's simple, and the Kremlin's theme repeats itself many times over the course of the film.  But its fun, and it does set a dark yet whimsical tone for the movie.  It's the one thing that keeps a consistent tone through the film.

Gremlins is a fine movie, though not one of Spielberg's best.  It's remembered for the characters, and for being one of the films that pushed the PG rating right up against an R with ratings creep.  This was one of the films that's credited for the creation of the PG-13 rating.  And it's best watched by going in expecting a popcorn movie with a dumb plot and some lame jokes.",1446768000,,2011,4.530555555555556

927710,3,6304602898,"I haven't watched this movie since I was a kid (late 80s-early 90s). I remember it being so great. Wanted to watch it again after scoffing at a friend who claimed to have never seen it. From the start I was like, ""man, I don't remember this being so bad."" The acting is pretty terrible. And the story is pretty weak. I won't diss the cheap animitronics of the creatures, as this was made in the early 80s. Overall, a movie that child me would've given a 10, adult me now gives it a 4/10.

As far as Amazon streaming goes, I think it's just fine. Good streaming quality. And being a Prime member, I didn't have to spend money on this movie, as it was one of the free to stream movies.",1446508800,,683,4.135338345864661

927928,5,6304602898,"GREMLINS works because it aims at, and hits several targets dead-center! It works as a comedy, utilizing both light and dark humor. It's a convincing horror movie, w/ the eeevil GREMLINS emerging, after the story starts out as a deceptively sweet, kid's story. It's also an effective morality tale, using the title creatures to illustrate the folly of human nature. As an homage film, GREMLINS is ingenious, somehow, simultaneously, paying tribute to divergent classics like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, and monster movies such as INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS! It also manages to retain an endearing charm, in spite of it's more sinister / horror elements. Director, Joe Dante pulled off quite a juggling act w/ this masterwork of macabre silliness! The human characters are memorable, the little creatures, whether good or wicked, are a wonder of practical sfx, and the re-watchable scenes are too many to list here! GREMLINS is certainly one of the best films of the 80's.",1446422400,,970,5.06875

Depending on your morals, some families would not allow their children to watch it due to the swearing and frightening scenes when the maugwi turns into an evil Gremlin. I chose to watch this the night my son was out trick or treating because it is a movie I watched when I was 10 years old the year it first came out. If you were born in the 70's or sooner you may take a night to watch this movie again but I'd only recommend it to adults. I'd give it 3 out of five scares for family friendliness.",1446422400,,533,4.037735849056604

They could have shortened that part and it would have flowed better because I felt like the plot stalled just to show them doing even more ""funny"" things in town.

This movie really means something to me! This is one of my top 20 favorite movie of all time right next to ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High""! This is also one of my 8-year-old sister's favorite movies! I really wish I went and saw this in the theaters! I'll definitely see a remake of this in the theaters when ever they make one!

For those who've never seen or heard of it, it's about a guy named Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton, ""Forest Gump"", ""Tropic Thunder"") who's a very unsuccessful inventor who goes to Chinatown and finds a shop. He finds a mogwai and decides to get it. An old Chinese guy (Keye Luke, ""Battle Of The Planets"", ""General Hospital"") disagrees and tells Randall that he can't buy the mogwai. The grandson (John Louie, ""Oh, God! Book 2"", ""Scout's Honor"") ends up giving the mogwai to him and tells to never put him under the sunlight because it'll kill him, never give him a bath, and most importantly, never feed him after midnight! The next day, Randall's son, Billy (Zach Galligan, ""Surviving"", ""Waxwork"") and his dog Barney get threatened by Miss Deagle (Polly Holliday, ""Mrs. Doughtfire"", ""Alice"") which causes the dog to scare her. That night, Randall comes home and gives the mogwai to Billy as a Christmas present. The next night, Billy's neighbor, Pete (Corey Feldman, ""Stand By Me"", ""The Goonies"") accidentally spills water onto Gizmo. 5 other mogwais come out of Gizmo's back. Randall plans to sell the other mogwais, calling them ""The Peltzer Pet"". Billy accidentally feeds the other mogwais after midnight. The other mogwais turn into eggs. The eggs hatch. The other mogwais are now evil gremlins. They end up scaring Gizmo, Billy's dog, his mother (Frances Lee McCain, ""Back To The Future"", ""Stand By Me""), his girlfriend, Kate (Phoebe Cates, ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", ""Drop Dead Fred""), & the whole town!

The story unfolds through:

Billy getting Gizmo.  The birth of the evil Mogwai.  The appearance of the pods, and the birth of the Gremlins.  Billy's mom destroying 3 Gremlins in her kitchen.  Billy saving her from a 4th, and Stripe's escape.

Stripe diving into a pool, creating an army of Gremlins - all his to command.  The chaos they unleash on the town is hilarious and brutal.  The horde of Gremlins traps Kate in the bar, and Billy saves her.  Then the horde's death by fire in the movie theater.  Stripe and Billy battling each other in the department store.  Finally Stripe's death at Gizmo's hands.

930949,2,6304602898,"Like ET I could not escape this movie as a kid so it's become one of those movies that I've never given second thought to loving. Having just re watched it for the first time in 20 years I was shocked at how bad it is. It struck me that the central characters of Billy and Kate are written young but cast old. For example look at what falls out of Billy's stocking or what's in his room. There all toys. If this is meant to convey some sort of message about adulthood it doesn't play that way. Even Billy's friend Pete is a child and it's really weird. So if they remake it I really hope they make it a kids movie like the recent Earth to Echo which itself was a throwback to movies like The Goonies and The Monster
Squad. They most certainly will not go full on horror movie as it was originally intended so why not make a Pixar-esque family movie. I get that I'm pissing all over a classic here but I'm speaking objectively not blindly based on how I felt about it in the past. Trust me it's hard to let this go but there are plenty more classics from my childhood that still hold up so Gremlins is no love lost to me.",1435622400,,1120,4.072398190045249

931918,4,6304602898,"I had forgotten there is a VERY DARK scene where the Phoebe Cates character talks about why she doesn't like Christmas. If you have youngish children who are into Santa Claus, this is probably not something you want to see.  It is pretty easy to skip through.  You'll see it coming when she starts monologuing with the male lead.  It has no other relation to plot.

SPOILER: Daddy went missing. They discovered him dead, dressed up as Santa, caught in the chimney.  I think it was Christmas Eve.

I have no idea why this scene was in the movie, as there isn't any happy redemption or way for her to get over it, nor does it add anything. It's kind of weird overall.  Guess it gives Phoebe a reason to mope around and some ""depth"". Once the Gremlin ""fun"" starts, she gets more animated.

Overall, just as entertaining as I remembered watching it when it came out. Especially good for tweener ages.",1419897600,,896,4.487654320987654

The characters were very one-dimensional.  The script writing may have been good at that time, but now is very poor.  There was actually a line in the movie that said ""While some people are opening presents on Christmas--others are opening their wrists.""  Yikes!  We turned it off half-way through.

Many movies made in the 80's have a cozy fun feeling even when they were trying to scare the tar out of you they seemed to have a quaint simplicity and general fun feel that is hard to duplicate these days

I consider this movie more of a sci-fi horror comedy and from the moment the opening scene begins I get that cozy fun feeling that brings me back, it's just a great classic with a good story good acting performances and a cute critter name gizmo, it's one of my favorite movies made in the 80's

932675,3,6304602898,"Junk Food! I can't help but like this movie. I just watched it again after almost 30 years (that's really hard to believe.) It's amazing to think this was all done before computer animation--the puppetry and animatronics are awesome. I will say that, as a film-maker myself, the writing and the cheese are rather ridiculous at times. 'have to remind myself that it's basically ""a cartoon."" The ""My father died in our Chimney playing Santa Claus"" monologue is totally absurd, out of place, and un-called-for. 'not sure what bitter memory Chris Columbus was stabbing in the heart of the holiday there--and maybe someone can explain why that's in the movie--a movie where Spielberg so carefully stopped Columbus and others from putting really ""nasty"" stuff in it (the mother was supposed to be decapitated, and Gizmo was originally to become Stripe, the evil leader.) Regardless, it is still fun. One other quick note: This movie instigated the PG-13 rating because it was too violent for PG and not bad enough for R. That's ""of note"" because my 7 year old was rather upset watching it. 'kinda forgot how violent it is--even though cartoonish. oops!

932682,5,6304602898,"Gremlins is one of my favorite 80's movies that I grew up as well as one of all time favorites.  I couldn't wait to own this new 30th anniversary edition, even though I pretty much own this movie on virtually every format (even laserdisc).

The only thing I'll discuss in my review is the new stuff offered in this ""Diamond Luxe Edition"" of this movie.  I'm pretty sure that disc #1, is exactly the same as the previous bluray release that includes the movie and a bunch of special features.  If you own the previous release and all you care about is the movie itself, then I'd recommend just holding onto that movie and saving your money. Also please note, that these new Diamond Luxe releases have some great packaging that makes me look forward to upcoming WB releases in this format.  Perhaps a 30th anniversary Goonies next year...

Disc #2 is for the Gremlin fan and completist.  It contains all new material that all versions before it did not include, primarily because the 2 featurettes were filmed this year to coincide with its 30th anniversary.  There is also an on-set feature with Hoyt Axton who played dad Rand Peltzer that was filmed in either 1983 or 1984 as he takes the viewer around the WB lot while he was filming Gremlins.  The last bonus feature are 2 digital motion comics that were taken from these storybooks that also came out in 1984 called ""The Gift of the Mogwai"" and ""The Last Gremlin"".  These were little storybooks offered at Hardee's restaurants when the movie came out that included a record that you could read along as you listened to it.  Unfortunately, this feature only features the first and last book in that series.  It would have been nice that all 5 of those books had been given the motion comic treatment but it was still nice and nostalgic to see those once again.  I'll have to get mine out of storage one of these days.

Now my big gripe about this is not towards the product itself but how Warner Bros. handled it a couple of weeks ago by announcing that this new edition of Gremlins (along with 4 more titles) will solely be a Best Buy exclusive only a mere week and a half before the September 30th street date.  Had I not been such a big fan of this movie I would wait until mid-December when all retailers get it.  I had it on preorder here on Amazon only to cancel my order so I can get it right away from Best Buy.  I won't go into much detail but when looking in my area when this came out last week it was next to impossible finding one.  Either Best Buy only ordered 2 for the rack or didn't order it at all when it was advertised in their weekly sales ad.

Overall, if you are a diehard Gremlins fan, then I recommend grabbing this one.  The new special features contain some great stuff including a scene described by Zach Galligan with an Easter Egg that in my dozens of times seeing this and knowing it word for word contains something that I completely missed.

Gets a new blu-ray re-issue from Warner bros to mark it's 30th Anniversary
this new re-issue on 2 Discs has new packaging and new special features plus the old special features from the 2009 blu-ray release
the packaging is not a standard case,
it's a fold out Digi-pak with very hard case covers like Hard plastic which is called Diamond Luke packaging
i prefer the standard blu-ray case not a fold out Digi-pak
Disc 1 has the feature film in the exact same blu-ray transfer & exact same widescreen ratio as the 2009 release
WB did not give the film a new transfer and just left it as it is.
the special features on Disc 1 are exactly the same as the single Disc 2009 release
all the old Audio commentary tracks, Additional scenes, Deleted scenes, outtakes
Behind the scenes footage, everything from the 2009 release is on this Disc no Difference at all

Disc 2 has the new special features released for this 30th Anniversary
a  new 30mins retrospective featurette
new interviews with writer Chris columbus, executive producers Steven spielberg, Frank marshall, Michael Finnell
and Director Joe Dante
the only Actor interviewed is Zach Galligan actually
Phoebe Cates left the Acting business over 10 years ago so of course she's not interviewed
she Did the Audio commentary for the DVD release years ago which is on Disc 1 of this blu-ray anyway
Judge reinhold & Corey Feldman are also not interviewed for some reason
but Judge reinhold did the Audio commentary for the dvd release anyway
Actor Hoyt Axton passed away years ago anyway
still a very interesting 30 min's that's for sure

the 2nd featurette goes for about 20mins is a new interview with creature effects artist Chris walas
who gives his recollections on making the Gremlins creatures
the producers and Joe Dante from the first featurette are also interviewed
there is also On set footage with Actor Hoyt Axton goes for 5mins
plus 2 motion comics from the 1984 Gremlins book

altogether both new featurettes go for 50mins in total
and WB could've easily put it on the 1 blu-ray Disc with the film for sure
blu-ray has more Data space than dvd
but obviously WB chose to stretch the content out on 2 Discs

the U.K. blu-ray release of this new 30th Anniversary
which is ALL REGIONS is standard blu-ray case packaging with 2 Discs inside
which is shown on amazon uk website
both the U.S. and U.K. 30th Anniversaries of Gremlins have exact same content, have exact same blu-ray transfer
i prefer the standard blu-ray case i bought my copy from amazon uk
but up to you which version you want

Definitely time to upgrade and get this new 30th Anniversary edition which has old and new special features
5 stars for sure for this new blu-ray re-issue.",1404777600,,2737,4.7154811715481175

932951,5,6304602898,"Since almost everybody has seen Gremlins by now, I won't waste any time explaining how great this classic film is, but rather inform readers that the new bonus features of the 30th anniversary edition distinguishes itself from the previous 25th anniversary edition.  Warner Brothers has not officially announced that the special features from the 25th edition will make its way to the 30th anniversary edition, but it is assumed they will.  For now, I have listed the new special features of the 30th edition.

Bonus Special Feature:
From Gizmo to Gremlins: Creating the Creatures (New) - Special effects wizard Chris Walas plus the filmmakers and cast guide us through the art of creating Gremlins, Gizmo and Stripe, how the puppets worked (or didn't!) and how their voices came to be.
Cute. Clever. Mischievous. Intelligent. Dangerous: Making Gremlins (New) - Steven Spielberg tells how he found the screenplay for Gremlins and why it was perfect for his then-new company Amblin Entertainment. Dante, Marshall and Finnell also participate.
Motion Comic of the 1984 Book ""Gremlins: The Gift of the Mogwai"" (New)
Motion Comic of the 1984 Book ""The Last Gremlin"" (New)

932953,5,6304602898,"TO BE UPDATED ONCE THE BLU-RAY IS RELEASED.  FOR NOW, MY VIEWS ON THE FILM ITSELF.

Back in the day, when this movie was released in theaters, I was merely a child, too young to even be able to read.  A couple of years later, though, I got to see this movie on TV.  And it made such an impression on me I feared the dark for years after watching it.

Gremlins tells the story of a young boy who's given a unique Christmas gift by his father.  An inventor of crazy contraptions, the father enters a weird store ran by an old asian wise man while looking for a gift.  There, he meets Gizmo, an impossibly cute strange little furry creature called a ""Mogwai"" and instantly wants it.  After being denied the purchase by the owner, he makes a deal with an employee and gets to bring the creature home, with a list of strange rules for its care: Never let Gizmo be exposed to bright light, never get him wet and never feed him after midnight.

Bright light, as it turns out, harms Gizmo, so they avoid it.  But the other rules have no explanation, so they leave the family curious.  Unfortunately, soon enough those rules are accidentally broken.  Getting Gizmo wet makes him reproduce, creating a bunch of other little creatures, as cute as him but clearly far less nice.  The real bad part comes when they're accidentally fed after midnight.  It so happens that this makes the Mogwais transform into the eponymous Gremlins, wicked, mischievous and (in the case of punk-haired Spike) even plainly evil reptilian small monsters, which then proceed to wreak havoc in the small town, and it's up to the boy, his girlfriend and Gizmo to stop them.

Now, this film is one of cinema's most beloved classics.  The story is a strange tale of fantasy and terror, with dark humor and tons of ingenious references (for instance, at some point, the father is demonstrating an invention while on the background we can see a guy sitting on the Time Machine from H. G. Wells story, pressing a lever, then there's a cut and when we see the background again the machine is gone, leaving just a puff of smoke).  While the sequel would go on to be full humor, this film had some truly terrifying bits.  This comes specially at the end, when there's a warning that implies the creatures could be real, and you should always check on dark places.  To a small child, this can be very shocking, and I assure you, I checked under my bed before going to sleep for a long time before I realized Gremlins wouldn't be real.

One of the best parts of the film are, of course, the special effects.  Being released when it was, the film had no CGI, it was all made with practical effects, and they were glorious.  They still hold up to this day, and they're always a joy to watch.  You will believe Gizmo has a soul, and you will be terrified to see Spike's grimace.

The previous Blu Ray release of this film was very lackluster in quality and features.  Let's hope this one changes things for the best.  I will update the review as soon as I get hold of this release, in order to speak of the Blu Ray itself.",1404345600,,3074,4.406028368794326

If you like comedic horror films this is definitely one to watch.  I used to watch this all the time when I was growing up.  Although I am a big fan of comedy horror, or horror films in general, movies like ""Critters"", or small monsters have always been fun.

933188,5,6304602898,"I love nontraditional Christmas movies.  If they have a little bite and backbone to them so much the better.  This one involves a desperate father (Hoyt Axton) trying to find a Christmas gift for his son (Zach Galligan).  In an antique store in Chinatown, he finds a gift in the form of a cuddly creature called a Mogwai.  The critter comes with a set rules that are immediately broken so that the worst case scenario can take place.  Several generations later, vicious gremlins emerge and wreck havoc in the small town of Kingston Falls.  Death, destruction, and ruin follow suit (plus a great deal of skewed humor).  Polly Holliday channels Margaret Hamilton as the town witch (Mrs. Ruby Deagle) with a vendetta against Billy's (Galligan) dog.  Most of the cast do a splendid job with the roles they were given, especially Dick Miller as Murray Futterman.  If you get sick of all the treacle served up by most Christmas movies, watch this one for a change of pace.  It's nothing less than fun.",1388188800,,995,4.699421965317919

I saw this originally AFTER Lost Boys, and I ALWAYS remembered that because Most people would think 1st because it's a kids movie.....but something funny--is if you know your movies, there's an order to these even though they're all support----- When these 1st came out it goes lime this.....Ghoulies, Critters and Gremlins....and they're all pretty similar (this counts from when they turn from cute little Mogwai 2 Gremlins.....and become little monsters (Hey I like em' and have wanted a Mogwai since I was a kid......but NOT just one like GIZMO......one like Stripe 2(who's like the baddest of all the villainous creatures....and yep this was when I was a kid.......but by this time I'd also scene Lost Boys and a WHOLE lot of Scary Movies.......which brings me 2 a funny point that I know everyone knows....lots and lots and LOTS of people watches this for X mas (although I just kinda watch it when I want now.....but that's cause I like 2 stretch out my favorite holidays) But this one fits better for Halloween (in a nightmare before xmas kinda way) Which brings me 2 another point.....Stripe I love you, even when you're playing that arcade game, but You should let GIZMO play his gold trumpet! Mean! Definitely NO Food after midnight now......although I would let them take down that mean old lady! I don't like her anymore now then when I was a kid! But I love when the  Gremlins are singing (even though Its VERY off key (but EXTREMELY funny) Let's see, there's Gremlins Xmas.....Love the song Intro by the way) I know there's something I'm forgetting.....Oh yeah! Corey Feldman' s in this 2! Here's something interesting though if you've seen the McDonald's Xmas Commercial he was in when he was 6; I bet you'd think I saw this then ( when ACTUALLY I only saw it a few months ago on Utube.....why? Nobody knows I mean for a girl who's seen all his movies since I was 8, you'd think I would've......but I missed it, I saw it when I was watching an Interview he did for Lost Boys The Tribe and where he would've been about 10 in Gremlins....he's only 6 here it's so VERY fun! Again WHY do I know so much? No I'm NOT like Kathy Bates in Misery.......I'm just me....a cool outcast....and soon you'll know all of the story!",1385164800,,2373,4.623222748815166

I've gone through all the special features, and all the behind-the-scenes option includes is a couple pages of text. That was a big selling point for an 80s kid who grew up under Spielberg's reign.

The movie was magical,whimsical my own fantasy world. The transformed gremlins horrified me and but I did get the adult ways they were acting.. Partying getting into mayhem ! I found it funny. I didn't see it as dark comedy just the way the movie was! As an adult the magic was gone! It wasn't creepy ,funny whimsical,stripe was obviously the leader they said it enough plus he was the only one with hair! Duh! I forgot the main characters were adults! Very young adults but still adults. I must have paused the movie 7 times and even walk out to the store during it! I didn't hear the sad story that kate  told( a lot of stuff was going on that even the characters seemed annoyed like get on with it)when I was young! How could anyone not like Christmas? Now as an adult I have plenty of reasons why Christmas is a time I dread! Obviously the movie was well written the stars were perfect and the town adorable but that's it! Please don't think I hate the picture I may try to see it again with a child to see the magic in their eyes! And we will watch it around Christmas! I may feel a bit different!!

933369,5,6304602898,"Made in 1984, I can't ever remember a time that Gremlins wasn't part of my December.  Steven Spielberg gives us this borderline terrifying movie coupled with hilarity, jokes, and slapstick to get us through what could have been a potential horror flick.  A father buys his son a gift in the form of a Mogwai, a cute little ball of fur with big bat ears, for Christmas.  This cute, adorable, little pet has only three rules.  1) They hate bright lights and sunlight can kill them, 2) They should never be gotten wet, and 3) They should never be fed after midnight.  Gizmo, the name of the Mogwai, becomes fast friends with Billy, the son, but when an accident happens getting Gizmo wet, a whole world of trouble is brought to their sleepy, snow-ridden town during that particular Christmas.

Gremlins is a fun, fast movie, for people of all ages, and has been a name stay during the holidays since it came out nearly three decades ago.  This particular DVD has a few special features, like 10 minutes of extra footage, commentaries, behind-the-scenes documentaries, and the trailer.  It's definitely worth the few bucks you would spend on it and is sure to provide your family and yourself with much entertainment over the years.",1376956800,,1228,4.732394366197183

I clicked the ""Info"" button on my favorite television provider, and I was shocked to see that 80 percent or more of critics liked this thing!  How is that even possible?  Perhaps they were taken hostage by the scary little Gremlins in the film, and told that, if those critics gave a bad review, that they would be tied up and forced to watch the film over and over, until their eyes and their ears bled out?

Well, on the bright side, their is Phoebe Cates.  She's certainly not scary, at least to look at.  But if you're over five years old, how can you appreciate a film with fake little puppets, bad acting, and no real adult humor?  This would be a big pass by me.",1363996800,,927,4.2272727272727275

933541,3,6304602898,"I watch this movie today and see that its not as great as I thought it was.. even though its very funny and fun.
but from my POV I see a treatise on the socio-economic situation of that particular time that is relevant today.  the protagonists household is a warm and loving one, even though everything is falling apart and nothing seems to work.  they rely on this stuff(material gain) and of cousrse it all seems to bite them in the butt everytime they slam the front door..which is portrayed as the real dysfunctionality of the family unit.  it seems to be saying that we have too much stuff, and too much stuff is what doesnt work.  also, this movie seems to profile certain ethnic persons as being a problem too.  If you notice amongst the ner do well types represented by the gremlins you will find ghetto-blaster totting, break danceing, gremlins mixed right in with the junky gremlins, drunk gremlins, ski masked criminal gremlins, hipster/beat gremlins, and gangster strong-arm gremlins(gremlin, ie Stripe).  Yes folks, these types are portrayed as the gremlins in the social mechanism that makes life a living hell for all us lace curtain mo-foes out there trying to live our lives in peace.  I also have to add this little one in there:  they introduce the break dancing gremlin in a rather homosexual light with the stereotypical PINK leg warmers and all.. and if you notice there is some cross-dressing going on amongst the gremlins as well.  yeah, these are the types that are the monkey-wrenches in the societal machinery.  I don't believe in accidents in films because there is soooo much incredible thought put into every last detail of every scene made in a film(it comes down to financial planning).  Theres also the treatment of the evil heartless bankers and landlords thrown in there for good measure;  ""mommy im hungry.. yes honey, im hungry too.."".  Its a veritable smorgasbord of elitist commentary on what they think is wrong with all us little folk.  but wait!  who's going to save us?!..well The college kids of course! The new reich! the new useful idiots(as lenin liked to call them)!  Oh yeah! but also, what kills these horrid wretched gremlins in the system?  light! illumination!  these freeeeks hate the light and illumination of politically correct and double checked mainstream knowledge, because they're so effed-up and ignorant.  No doubt about it, the illuminated youth movement is our only hope.  HAIL!
 so let us not water-down the real problems in our society lest they go unchecked and multiply! Lets not feed our social/mental/spiritual midnight, because thats when all the freaks come out.  Rather, let us combat them with truly ILLUMINATED minds..and kill em all.
Its either that or its just a mediocre comedy/monster movie.

933717,4,6304602898,"With its inane mix of genres, attitudes and inspirations, there's really no good reason for this movie to work as well as it does. Like the ubiquitous creatures at the heart of the plot, Gremlins delights in mayhem. The proud owner of a restless spirit and a tendency to rattle the gearbox at the slightest hint of a lull, the film can be splendidly unpredictable, charmingly sweet and morbidly profane, sometimes all within the same scene. It's vividly violent, often shockingly so, but still touts a wild sense of humor and an unexpected knack for sentimentality. I was pleasantly surprised at the lengths it was willing to go to, considering no member of the cast indispensable, and that left me hooked right up until the closing showdown. It's not the perfect picture - there are holes in the plot large enough to roll a bulldozer through - but as a sharp, silly change of pace in the holiday season, one could do far worse.",1356652800,,928,4.664634146341464

Could have done without the racist remark at the end of the movie, but unfortunately; when people in the entertainment field get a little too much Fame and or Money; they get the grandiose idea that their political feelings should of course be everyone's viewpoint. Steven Spielberg, for as formulamatic as his films are, has found his niche in life; even if it is mostly in his own mind. I don't know how many times I have said it or heard someone else exclaim it after being ambushed with a racial or political aside in what is supposed to be a mere entertainment diversion- Keep your Politics to yourself! If the film were about Aliens then his comment could have been taken as a blanket statement about the human condition. Since the IDMB website lists these (imaginary) creatures as an animal indigenous to China that somehow turn into Demons when not cared for properly; we cannot assume the aforementioned. I watch movies for they're entertainment value, not what the Producer or Director flavor of the week thinks about other Races or Political issues. It's 1 of the main reasons Fun With Dick And Jane with Jim Carrey was a forgettable movie along with many others. Hey! We don't want to hear it!

October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are ""alternative"" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!

""Gremlins"" is both hilarious and entertaining. The little critters are truly charismatic and mesmerizing (at least until they undergo their rather disturbing transformation, when fed past midnight or exposed to water!). Obviously, the special effects for this movie are quite dated (it's almost thirty years old now), but ""Gremlins"" was a staple of cinema for any child of the 80s. It's still quite entertaining (and comforting, in a strange way), though I suspect it may not be as well received by younger audiences who are used to modern productions. For those of us who grew up in the  80s, however, ""Gremlins"" is still gold, and a great ""alternative"" Halloween movie for the season of spookiness.",1350691200,,1322,5.059633027522936

I am now a 22 year old woman & the gremlins series are two of my favorite ""scary movies"" I watch them every time I see they are on, laugh the entire time I watch them, & will be buying this movie. For all the people complaining about how bad the acting is & blah blah blah guys this movie was made in 1984 not 2004 & is supposed to be a raunchy,comedic, semi-horror movie. Is it scary? Heck yes it's scary, the first time you watch it. If you show it to your kids they're probably gonna have some problems sleeping for a few nights, but guess what my parents told me when I got like that when I was younger? ""It's just a movie, go to sleep. *turns lights out*"" Guess what? I learned to tell myself it's just a movie (even if I had to say it to myself 2000 times til I passed out)& go to sleep, the next morning I would wake up smiling because nothing happened to me & realized that scary movies are just that, movies. They're not real. & I'm fine now, no therapy, no irrational fears of the dark, no dreaming about Gremlins coming to get me. If anything this movie's a lesson in following instructions, Peter was clearly told not to get it wet or feed it after midnight & he did anyways soooo it's kinda his fault things went sour. The 80s and 90s were full of movies & shows that didn't have cheery songs & happy go lucky characters in them that although frightening we still appreciate now. I watched Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Child's Play, Are You Afraid of the Dark, Candyman and Pumpkinhead & I screamed  and hid under the covers every time but I loved every second of it just as much as I loved Disney movies.

A rather incompetent inventor goes into a curiosity shop in Chinatown looking for a Christmas gift for his teenage son. He comes across an odd little creature, as adorable as a teddy bear, called a Mogwai. He wants to buy it, but the old man who runs the shop says it's not for sale. The old man's grandson, however, says they need the money, and he brings it out to sell in the alley. Along with the Mogwai comes three rules for taking care of him: (1) he does not like bright lights; (2) don't get him wet, and (3) most important, never, ever feed him after midnight.

Of course, all three rules are eventually broken, and the results are scaly green gremlins that run riot all over town. As I say, the bar-room scene is quite hilarious. A large group of them are cornered in the movie theater (where some more great visual jokes are done), but Stripe, the leader of the gang, gets into the department store across the street.

The cute little Mogwai, named Gizmo, eventually triumphs, but how he does is the funniest movie you'll see in many a year.",1337385600,,1240,4.313304721030043

I finally decided to reach back into my childhood and see if the BD was worth the effort. And my answer - a resounding yes!

Some BDs of 70's and 80's films don't come with a very pretty restored picture. Not so here. Since there are more puppets than not, the special effects are outstanding. The special features are on the light side, but you don't grab BDs for those, unless you're me. The commentaries are fun, especially the director and lead actors Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates. There are some new/exteded scenes, and a dated making-of featurette (which is not to say it's worthless, it's just dated). The audio channels are actually beterr than anticipated, with a heavy TrueHD 5.1 right on the top (I still miss 7.1 though). There's a ton of subtitle tracks as well, which as I always say, is greatly appreciated.

This is a seminal 1980's film wrapped up in a bow, literally. It's just the sort of off-beat film that warrants being called a Christmas film. Now, there's only one question to ask yourself:

Secondly, what on earth made the man think that this would be a good pet  given the risk????. I mean sure  there was a clear set of instructions  don't put it in light or water and don't feed it after midnight but usually if  instructions aren't followed when it comes to pets the worse thing that happens is they die. not turn into completely evil, ugly looking, murderous, idiotic creatures.

This is not a family movie and it is definitely not  for children. It will give them nightmares. The events also take place around Christmastime I'm pretty sure a kid wouldn't want scary memories associated with that holiday or  time of year.

934004,4,6304602898,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The 1984 movie ""Gremlins"" boasts a spectacular blend of comedic and horror elements, and is a uniquely crafted popular classic.  The diverse cast includes Hoyt Axton, Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Polly Holliday and Keye Luke.

The story, by noted director Chris Columbus, is by now familiar to many people.  A loving but stubborn father makes a detour into an eccentric shop which is overseen by a wise proprietor.  Upon seeing the exotic creature called a Mogwai, the father eventually cuts an illicit deal for the Mogwai with the shop owner's well-meaning but short-sighted grandson.  There is a little matter of three famous rules for Mogwai care which inevitably get broken and lead to horrific results.

The Gremlin creatures are genuinely gross, malevolent little beasts, and as their numbers multiply it is very believable that they can terrorize a town, making creative allowances for fiction.  Impressively, even today, they are not a dated special effect or puppet but credible characters in the film who ooze danger and menace.

I mentioned this film was a comedy and it is, but most of the humor is of a muted, vaguely dark variety.  A good example is when a Gremlin in a mailbox throws letters back out at a man who put some into the box.  There is also an oddly comedic scene in a movie theater, with many Gremlins happily watching Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""

Polly Holliday is suitably nasty as Mrs. Deagle, the mean-spirited old lady who has a grudge against Billy Peltzer, the movie's main protagonist.  Zach Galligan is credible and sympathetic in that role, and Phoebe Cates is perfect as Kate, Billy's sweet co-worker and girlfriend.

Also featuring Corey Feldman, Judge Reinhold, and solid direction by Joe Dante, ""Gremlins"" is very, very good.

934084,4,6304602898,"The movie -- I first saw Gremlins when I was a teenager, and I was drawn to the anarchic, irreverent, dark humor of the film. Seeing it decades later as an adult has rubbed off some of its luster -- the pacing is odd at times, and the synthesizer soundtrack is dated. Some of the special effects look clunky, such as the puppets used in some of the long shots. (But I prefer them to today's CGI effects, which look cold and sterile.) I still think it's an entertaining movie, though.

Image Quality of the Blu-ray -- This Blu-ray disc is the best I've seen this film look on home video. However, don't get your hopes up. This movie was a low budget affair shot on film stock with grain the size of golf balls. It's never going to look as clean as today's slick, plastic movies, even remastered in High Definition.

The Extras -- Extras are plentiful. There's two commentaries by the director Joe Dante and crew, outtakes and deleted scenes, and a TV special that aired back in the 80's to promote the feature.

Gremlins has a reputation as a film for children, probably because of Speilberg's involvement, and the cute Gizmo character. However, this movie, along with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, was controversial because its use of violence was too intense for a PG rated film. The PG-13 rating was created because of this. It would benefit parents to consider that if they're thinking of buying this video for their kids.",1268265600,,1433,4.5680933852140075
934125,5,6304602898,"The sleepy town of Kingston Falls is in for a world of trouble when Billy receives a cute little pet Mogwai for Christmas. Billy is given three easy rules to follow to keep his pet safe, but when he breaks two of them by mistake, the creature spawns a horde of mischievous little monsters that are bent on murder and mayhem! It is a Christmas we will never forget in GREMLINS, the classic creature-feature from 1984 that has left a permanent impression on pop-culture. Joe Dante works from various childhood influences like Looney Tunes and Merry Meoldies to create a wacky world of cartoon chaos, using the incredibly artistry and animatronics of Chris Walas to bring these tiny terrors to life. The creature designs are so nasty and finely articulated that they become indistinguishable from real life. Steven Spielberg's influence is always apparent in the picturesque setting of Kingston Falls. That is, until the Gremlins take over! What starts with cruel jokes and minor tampering turns into full blown madness as the monsters tear up the town and terrorize the neighbors. Dante always keeps the mood lighthearted and fun for all ages despite some of the darker tones and frightening monsters. Add to that the unforgettable characters created by Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Hoyt Axton, and the legendary Dick Miller, and you have a timeless classic to carry on the holiday horror tradition for years to come.

934130,5,6304602898,"""Gremlins"" is one of the great guilty pleasures of motion pictures. It's an absolute classic, tremendous fun every time you watch it. As one reviewer said, it's ""a hoot"".

Though ""Gremlins"" comes across as a perverse take on the holiday cheer of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (the dis-connection is explicitly made within the film), one cannot overlook ""Forbidden Planet"". Just as the ""Great Machine"" allowed the Krells' inner demons to take physical form, so are the gremlins a representation of our normally suppressed murderous impulses. Otherwise, why would Billy Peltzer * be so careless about the rules?

This is not as much of an interpretive stretch as it seems. Most of the scenes in which the ""bad"" or unlikeable characters are punished or killed were removed from the final cut. Mrs. Deagle (the film's equivalent of Old Man Potter) is murdered in a grotesquely comic manner, but the scene which ""justifies"" her offing (she's forcing the bank to foreclose properties on which a chemical plant will be built) was deleted. (Though the director's desire to keep the film moving along is justifiable, most of these scenes should have been restored for home video.)

In Renoir's ""Boudu Saved from Drowning"", the title character is another ""id monster"" whose animal presence utterly disrupts a middle-class family. There's little doubt that Stripe blowing his nose on the curtains is an homage to Boudu wiping his shoes with a satin bedsheet.

""Gremlins"" also has an element of Hitchcockian voyeurism. One of the film's ""pleasures"" is watching punishment meted out to those deserving it, through an agency (the gremlins) whose behavior we are not responsible for. Our ""murdering id"" can be vicariously gratified without legal or moral consequences.

""Gremlins"" anticipates films like ""Puppet Master"", ""Hostel"", and ""Saw"", which tittillate the audience with scenes of people being murdered or mutilated in a graphic, detailed fashion. **

""Gremlins""' iconic scene, in which Billy's mother kills three of the gremlins -- by grinding up one in a mixer, stabbing another repeatedly, and (classically) blowing up one in a microwave oven -- was the one that most aroused audiences (both pro and con), as it cuts close to the bone of how we would /sometimes/ like to handle our personal problems. Mrs. Peltzer isn't killing rats -- the gremlins are sentient, consciously malicious beings. Like, your boss, maybe?

In the running commentary, Joe Dante remarks several times that, had CGI been available, ""Gremlins"" would have been an altogether different film. Indeed. One of the film's charms is the audience's awareness that it is watching fur-and-rubber puppets ""live"" on the soundstage, performing an especially nasty ""Punch & Judy"" show. CGI just wouldn't be as much fun.

The Blu-ray transfer ranks a B -- ""Gremlins"" was not a sharply detailed film in the first place. (The image quality suggests an excellent projection print, rather than the camera negative.) On the other hand, one can better appreciate the beautifully complex lighting. And let's not forget Jerry Goldsmith's terrific score, one of his best. It's a pleasure to hear a score in which instruments are selected for their particular effect (a la Herrmann), and which doesn't continually drone on.

Unhesitatingly recommended.

* The name suggests the verb ""pelts"". The gremlins are very good at throwing things.

** It wasn't the first. ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"" (and its sequel) were quite gruesome, but nothing much was said about the violence.",1265414400,,3512,5.187279151943463
934131,5,6304602898,"When Billy Peltzer is given a small creature called a Mogwai by his father, he is unaware of the carnage he is about to encounter. There is a huge responsibility in looking after Gizmo as there are certain rules which must be followed. The Mogwai must be kept away from bright light, never made wet and never, ever be fed after midnight. When an accident occurs involving Gizmo and water, the next evolution stage of the Mogwai appears, and it isn't nice at all. Gremlins is a fantastic comedy movir from 1984. It's funny seeing the Gremlins cause mischief but it's also scary throughout-they're not exactly pretty creatures and are quite scary as well. This was one of Joe Dante's first movies and you can tell that everything he grew up with and movies he studied as a child are on-screen in Gremlins. A perfect movie made by the right director.",1264118400,,847,4.6158940397351
934132,4,6304602898,"Ok, so it IS an entertaining film and has lots of laughs despite how corny it is at times. What I can't figure out, though, is who this movie is supposed to be for. It's definitely not for little kids - there is far too much violence and blood (even though the blood is green). Bad Gremlins doing adult things and exploding in microwaves mean this is not a 90 minute babysitter for the little ones. Gremlins was one of the films that pushed the ratings board to create the PG-13 rating. On the other hand, teenagers & above will probably find it a bit too cutesy and childish to appeal to them.

The level of gore is surprising, which is how you can tell that this isn't technically a ""kids"" movie, so care should be taken with young children (but saying that I'd have been 7 when I saw this and had no problem....but then Nightmare on Elm Street might have desensitised me a bit by that time) but it's essential viewing if only so that you can watch the sequel too.",1253664000,,830,4.4605263157894735

934193,4,6304602898,"Don't expose them to sunlight. Don't let them get wet. And under no circumstances feed them after midnight.

Those are the rules for the now-legendary mogwai, adorable little fuzzballs who transform if you break the last rule. And ""Gremlins"" is a gloriously unconventional Christmas movie -- a postcard-pretty view of suburban middle-America, splattered with gore, nasty little gremlins and a truly wicked sense of humour (expressed often in movie send-ups).

Randall (Hoyt Axton) spots a tiny adorable creature -- a mogwai -- in a small Chinatown shop, and wants to buy it as a Christmas present for his son. The owner refuses, but his grandson secretly sells it to Randall.

Randall's son Billy (Zach Galligan) is delighted by the fuzzy lightphobic mogwai, whom he names Gizmo. But it soon becomes clear that Gizmo is full of surprises: when water is accidentally splashed on him, he spontaneously generates a litter of NEW mogwai. The ringleader ""Stripe"" tricks Billy into feeding them after midnight, transforming them into scaly, dangerous ""gremlins.

And after a gremlin tumbles into a pool, Billy realizes that the town is about to be swarmed with them -- attacking vicious old Mrs. Deagle, ramming snowplows, murdering kindly teachers, and trashing a tavern with Billy's love interest Kate (Phoebe Cates). As the town descends into gremlinized chaos, the two humans (and Gizmo) must find a way to wipe out the horde... and if they miss only one, it'll start all over again.

Personally I find most Christmas movies a little too sappy and sentimental. So for people who feel that way, a Yuletide horror/comedy is simply ideal -- it's sort of a mad hybrid of early Peter Jackson splattergore, Frank Capra snow-sprinkled Christmastime, and a bunch of sly movie homages and send-ups (""Forbidden Planet,"" ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Snow White"" amongst others).

But the real fun is in watching the movie's balance between nasty and cuddly -- Joe Dante happily veers between sweet moments and grotesquely funny violence (such as Billy's mom messily killing gremlins with a variety of kitchen implements), with the best example being the malevolent Mrs. Deagle being flung out an upstairs window by fa-la-la-la-LAing gremlins. Completely sick, and gutsplittingly funn.

And Dante sprinkles it with more G-rated comedy that borders on cartoonish without quite crossing, such as the kid in the Christmas tree costume (""Don't ask!"") and the gremlins destroying a local pub when they aren't watching Disney movies (is this a message about Disney?). It all climaxes in some literally explosive showdowns with the gremlins -- and particularly with Stripe, their ghastly little leader.

Galligan and Cates are thoroughly solid as the teenage heroes, especially when Cates gives her heartbreaking speech about the horrible experience that made her hate Christmas. In fact, all the actors do a solid job -- the evil old landlady who serves as a sort of Wicked Witch of the West/Scrooge hybrid, the cranky old veteran, the crackpot inventor and the wise old Chinese guy.

But the showstopper is Gizmo -- tiny, round, fuzzy and wide-eyed, with a babyish squeaky voice and a liking for toy cars and 3-D glasses. Rarely has a puppet been so bloody cute and endearing. His complete opposite is Stripe, a gremlin amongst gremlins -- malevolent and gleefully sadistic, he seems smart enough to revel in the idea of destroying the town.

""Gremlins"" is a brilliant horror/comedy that infuses a perfect American town with a little mayhem and gore, as well as some wickedly funny little nasties. Definitely a must-see.",1235952000,,3592,5.135273972602739

The CAST Commentartary/ The CREW Commentary is Always My Favorite Thing on DVDs, as Thay're Very Interesting To Figure Intresting History and Facts About The Film. The Deleted Scenes Are All Great, and Hopfully There Will Be An Extended Edition of GREMLINS and GREMLINS 2 Someday. The Origanal Making-Of Feature Back When The Film Was About To Come Out is Another Great Feature on The DVD as I Find It Interesting To See a Making-of Back During The 80s. Photo/Storyboard Galleries Ussally Bord Me, But The Ones on This DVD Were Grat, and Some Were Just Very Funny. CAST/CREW Film Highlights Are Always Good Cause You Might Just Know You Might've Seen An Actor In A Film Buit Couldn't Remember What The Title Was. The Trailers For both GREMLINS Films Are Great Fun As Well.

Though The Features Are Great, It Defenatly Needs More Accturally Be A Spiecial Edition.

934269,5,6304602898,"Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante, and Chris Columbus collaborated on this modern Christmas classic.  ""Gremlins"" is a mild horror film set in a small town that is easily a stand-in for Bedford Falls from ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Leave it to these three guys to inject a lot of subversive, sarcastic humor, using the vile Gremlins as their horror-comic tool.

The plot is well-known - a wacky inventor brings home the ""perfect Christmas present"" from a mysterious Chinese shop - a Mogwai. The Mogwai, Gizmo, is beyond cute (particularly thanks to the voice work of Howie Mandel).  But Giz has flaws - namely 3:  He hates bright light, he can't get wet, and you can never, ever feed him after midnight.

Of course, these rules get broken throughout the film, with terrific results.  The Gremlins overrun the town, causing hilarious, murderous mayhem along the way.  It's up to Zach Gilligan and Phoebe Cates as the stereotypically-nice guy and gal to save the day.

The plot is simple - the joy is in its execution.  This is one of the best Christmas movies to come out in recent years and is a wonderful antidote to all the holiday movies that focus solely on existential angst or rampant commercialism, although there is just enough anti-commercialism message in this flick to make it worthwhile.

To be fair, ""Gremlins"" is light-hearted stuff, but can be a little scary if you're kids are young (say, 6 or so, older kids should do just fine).  A couple of humans and a gazillion Gremlins meet their makers in unpleasant ways, and the Gremlins are pretty scary up close.  The kids will quickly adopt Gizmo as a favorite, but there are quite a few dark moments - and you'll never look at a microwave the same way again.",1229990400,,1713,4.688963210702341

934328,5,6304602898,"""Gremlins"" is a heartwarming Christmas movie that your entire family will enjoy! When I think of classic Christmas movies such as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"" I always fondly recall ""Gremlins."" Because isn't it such a great Christmas movie that all the kids will love. Afterall, ""Gremlins"" has snow, and decorations and Christmas music and even those cute, furry little pe(s)ts!

Seriously though, I do love ""Gremlins"" because it's such a great example of a totally 80's movie! Beware if you were not a child of the 80's you may find this movie dated, corny and incredibly hokum. Come to think of it, even if you were a child of the 80's you may think that as well! But it doesn't matter because ""Gremlins"" is all good! When this movie first came out my parents absolutely forbid my brother and I from watching it. Of course we didn't listen to them though.

""Gremlins"" was such a huge sensation; telling a kid that they couldn't see it would certainly constitute cruel and usual punishment! We even had our Gizmo stuffed animals and a few other things. Keep in mind that this movie spawned an entire genre of pseudo-horror flicks (""Ghoulies,"" and ""Goonies "" come to mind.)

""Gremlins"" tells the hilarious story of what happens when you don't follow the rules and let your Mogwai run wild! Billy Peltzer (played by one-hit wonder, Zach Galligan) receives an early Christmas gift, courtesy of his father Randall (played by Hoyt Axton.) Billy is warned not to ever expose Giz to bright lights or water and never to give him food after midnight (just a side note, if the Mogwai is from Asia, how exactly would he know that it was midnight?) Suffice it to say, the little critter soon multiples, courtesy of Billy's friend Pete (a very young Corey Feldman.)

I especially enjoyed some of the special effects. It was so odd watching Gizmo as he multiplied because the others literally popped out of him. It looked so realistic. Speaking of realistic, I also enjoyed watching the Gremlins hatch from the cocoons. They looked so disgusting and evil.

There're so many lucicrisly hilarious scenes. I could not stop laughing when the Christmas tree ""came alive"" and started attacking Mrs. Peltzer (Frances Lee McCain.) Actually it had one of the little denomic Gremlins hiding in it! The poor thing was badly stabbed in her face before the malicious Gremlin took off to spread some more Christmas cheer!

Ruby Deagle! She was a Super (starts with a Capital-B & rhymes with) Wiiiiiiiiiiiiitch. Mrs. Deagle was sure a far cry from Polly Holliday's days as Flo, the man-hungry waitress. Actually I'm not sure which was more terrifying, the entire pack of Gremlins or Mrs. Deagle! Her voice was entirely filled with hate and her eyes looked at Billy the way a king-cobra stares at her trapped prey! She was a bitter, old woman, that hated all people and dogs and any other sentient being with a smile (much like my mother-in-law.) Did you catch the part when Deagle went flying the hell out of her house! OMG so funny when that she-dog took off like that!! Polly played that role perfectly!! Because she managed to make Mrs. Deagle appear just as mean-spirited and vicious as any violent monster, even Naomi Campbell!

Here's some fun facts and trivia about ""Gremlins"" and the people who were in it:
* The voice of Gizmo was voiced by Howie Mandell.
* As a result of the controversy that erupted, the MPAA formed a new rating (PG-13.)
* The scene with Mrs. Peltzer killing one of the Gremlins in the microwave caused the most controversy.
* There really is a mythical creature called a Mogwai (keep in mind, it is mythical.)
* Because of its huge worldwide, unprecedented popularity, Warner Bros. decided to re-release ""Gremlins"" to theaters the following summer after its initial success.
* Zach Galligan guest stared on one ep of ""Melrose Place"" during the first season.
* Phoebe Cates stared in another cult-favorite, 1991's ""Drop Dead Fred.""
* Since taking the role of Mrs. Deagle, Polly Holliday has never been able to shake the image of a homely old lady, and has been typecast ever since.
* Zach Galligan has often been confused with Randall Batinkoff (who stared in Molly Ringwald's ""For Keeps."")
* There was a little-known horror movie from 1987, ""Munchies,"" which had very similar-looking creatures.
* There was actually one Mogwai (from the first batch, before any of them morphed into those destructive Gremlins) who actually showed kindness towards Gizmo; he was named Earl.

Why do I consider this the granddaddy of all 80's comedy/horror movies? Just because it's the whole good over evil saga; you know, the David and Goliath Story. And of course there's a sexy girl to keep Billy company, Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates) who is always eager to help fight the good cause. And the entire movie is so implausible, you just can't help but laugh at the blatant and utter foolishness.

Over the years there's been a lot of speculation on the true meaning of ""Gremlins."" I've heard so many different stories. To me, the moral of the story is that not everything is the way it seems. Take this movie for instance, when it came out 24 years ago, everyone got their p@nties all knotted up because it was only PG. But most of these people probably never even watched the movie. Because it wasn't scary or vulgar or offensive in the least bit. It was a comedy mixed with satire. Often, people are most afraid of things that they never even look at.",1207440000,,5461,4.7521097046413505

934332,5,6304602898,"Inventor Randy Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) has bought a special gift for his son Billy (Zack Gallaghan) and it's a furry Chinese creature called a Mogwai (voiced by Howie Mandall). But there are three important rules that must be followed if he wants to keep the creature such as number 1 which means to keep him away from bright light especially sunlight cause it will kill him, number 2 is to never get him wet and number 3 which is the most important rule of them all which is never feed them after midnight. But Billy does what he can but he accidently gets him wet one day and it makes him mutiply other Mogwaii like him and he accidently feed the Mogwaii except Gizmo after midnight as it makes them into ghastly reptilian ghouls that cause havok in the town of Kingston Falls.

Brilliant and highly original Horror fantasy comedy from executive producer Steven Spielburg, director Joe Dante (""The Howling"") and writer Chris Columbus. This movie became one of the biggest box-office hits of 1984 and of all time, this movie has a great sense of charm and of course black humor thrown into it with gruesomeness. The film co-stars Corey Feldman, Phoebe Cates and Dick Miller and special appearences by Robby the Robot and Chuck Jones, this movie did caused some controversy when it came out because parents thought it was too violent for small children even around the same time ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" came out. So the MPAA created the ""PG-13"" rating was created that year, i love how make-up artist Chris Walas did the lovable furballs and the hideous beasts and made them some of the most memorable creatures to hit the screen. The film has often been imitated much with films like ""Critters 1 & 2"" (Which are great movies in their own rights), ""Ghoulies"", ""Munchies"", ""Beasites"", ""Elves"", ""Evil Toons"", ""Troll"" and the worst one of them all ""Hobgoblins"", this one is a true must see even around the holidays.

934396,4,6304602898,"Gremlins was part of a tradition of 80s horror movies that dealt with a campy action and some strange creature coming into people's otherwise ordinary lives and causing destruction.  Steven Speilburg in his early career seemed to favor mainstream comic movies that had a slightly silly premise mixed in with action and some horror aspects, but kept it light and airy enough to appeal to children as well as adults.  This was one of them, in keeping with his success from E.T.

Billy Peltzer is given an early Christmas gift from his father, who bought a curious creature called a mogwai from an ancient Chinese man's cherio shop.  He is named Gizmo, and aside from being adorable and so cute you want to squeeze him all the time, there are some special rules for handling him.  No bright lights, especially sunlight as it will kill him.  Never get him wet, and never feed him after midnight.  Naturally, these rules are going to be broken and disaster is going to strike.

When Billy accidentally gets him wet, five new mogwai are among them.  Their antics are crafier, fouler, and sneekier than anything Gizmo attempted, as he is sweeter and good natured while these are the mean ones that sabatoge machines like they are famous for.  Trouble is predicted ... And eventually they get Billy to feed them after midnight.  Could it be more cheesy that he's watching Attack of the Pod People From Mars when he nods off to sleep, then wakes up the next day to find that the five are in cocoons?  That night, they hatch, turn into horrible mosters, and wreck the town.

When they turn into the horrible green monsters, the movie takes another turn.  They become ridiculous as well as destructive, turning it from a horror story into a somewhat silly chain of events.  There is plenty of gross out as well, especially the Stripe's melting in the sunlight climax.  It was a good time, a silly horror fantasy movie.  And even after all these years, Gizmo is still so cute I want to squeeze him. :)",1179705600,,1989,4.621082621082621
934397,4,6304602898,"It seems that just about every good movie, turns out some how to be connected with Steven Spielberg.  Whether he produced it, directed it, or both.  In this case, Spielberg was the executive producer of this timeless, borderline classic.  Its moments of greatness, I believe are attributed to its clever, yet simple, portrayal of never before seen characters and there ability to make you laugh.  Point in case, being the magui and their transformation into the ""gremlins"".  Of course, everybody in the real world has heard of a ""gremlin"", but no one has ever seen one.  This is what I thought was a clever ""fairy tale"" who's roots were never really explained, until now.

Gremlins are infectiously funny and effortlessly entertaining with its blend of cutesy charm and comic book horror. The creatures themselves are excellently brought to life with some masterful puppetry and Joe Dante's direction really does the film justice.

This movie is crammed with memorable scenes, subtle parody and excellent, yet quite humorous horror.

Still, Joe Dante and Steven Spielberg manage to pull off a pretty decent genre even if it is out of season. If you are into pop culture, Gremlins is probably one of the many unique films of the 1980's, especially 1984. To sum up the story, a man gets his 18 year old son a pet from Chinatown known as a Mogwei (spelling?). The pet's name is Gizmo and there are a few rules to consider. The first, don't let it near bright light or sun light which could kill it. The second, don't let it get wet. The third, never feed it after midnight. Sound ridiculous? It is, but the movie is still good none the less. There is campy and somewhat demented humor here and there from the gremlins themselves even though they turn out to be semi-vicious monsters but the movie doesn't fail to entertain those with open minds. Plus, the character development along with the acting is good and you may find yourself wanting to watch Gremlins every couple years or so.

Billy is warned that he must follow three rules with the Mogwai, whom he names Gizmo: 1) keep him out of light, especially sunlight; 2) don't get him wet; and 3) never feed him after midnight. It doesn't take long before the rules are broken and disaster ensues: the Gremlins multiply and none of them are as cute and lovable as Gizmo. The Gremlins cause much destruction and mayhem in Billy's quiet little town and he and his girlfriend, Kate, rush to stop them before the town is totally destroyed.

Gremlins is a great movie that has a bit of everything: humor, horror, parody and even romance. Billy's town is straight out of ""It's A wonderful Life"" and the rich and not so nice Mrs. Deagle is a modern day Miss Gulch from The Wizard of Oz. Outside of some scene's in the Peltzer's kitchen and what happens to Mrs. Deagle, the Gremlins are more mischievous than deadly. However, the kitchen scenes are a bit gruesome and not suitable for younger viewers. Most of the film is darkly comic, if a bit violent, especially the bar scene, the scene where the Gremlins call caroling at Mrs. Deagle's house, and the movie theater scene, as well as the final climax. The one scene that feels out of place to me is when Kate describes why she hates Christmas.  I've seen the movie many times and still wonder why that scene was left in.

The acting is quite good in this movie. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates have a nice chemistry together and make a sweet couple. Frances Lee McCain is excellent as Billy's terrorized mother and Hoyt Axton does a great job as Billy's lovable but inept inventor father (some of the funniest scenes in the movie revolve around his inventions). Dick Miller is good as Billy's paranoid neighbor, and Polly Holiday chews up the scenery as the cruel Mrs. Deagle. Judge Reinhold shows up briefly as a potential love rival for Kate and then disappears from the movie, as does Corey Feldman as Billy's young neighbor.

This movie isn't for everyone's taste. I saw the movie with a friend who hated it saying she didn't see anything funny about people being killed at Christmas. Personally, I thought it was wickedly funny and recommend it to fans of darkly comic horror movies.",1123459200,,2315,4.625304136253042

He tries to warn the authorities, but they don't believe him until the creatures show up and go on a rampage throughout the town.

Every monster movie convention in the book is used, including all the famous shocks such as something jumping out in the foreground and something jumping out in the background, but what makes this film original is the Gremlins' silly personalities. They don't eat people or kill them in order to survive in any way. They just want to have fun and cause chaos! Their personalities are almost human and seem to represent a side of us that has no morals and just wants to let loose in a world without regulations.

934466,3,6304602898,"I reckon quite a few people will be very surprised when they find out that I'm nearly 21, and I've only just seen Gremlins. I don't know why I never saw it when I was a kid, or seen it on the TV at Christmas. It's weird. I wasn't even sure about the storyline when it was put on. Obviously, I knew the character Gizmo - having begged my Dad to get me the toy in a window a few years ago, and never got it. :( I also think that the Gizmo/Gremlins started off the craze of Furbies in the UK a couple of years ago - little characters that if you switch them on, and line them up with others, they talk/sing utter nonsense to each other! I'm actually sure I still have a few more in my room somewhere, but not Gizmo ones, although I'm sure they're out there.

I was completely unaware of what the film was actually about, and wasn't expecting the 'evil' Gremlins to quite literally come out of Gizmo, and take over the world. I was expecting a nice little happy family movie, based around Gizmo. I'm not so sure I would have enjoyed the movie if I'd been a few years younger, as the evil Gremlins scared the bejeezus out of me! Especially Stripe - scary! There's also some Looney Tunes references in the movie, although coming from my major Looney Tunes fan man, there's even more references in the second one, which I've yet to see. Of course, it was directed by Joe Dante, who did the fabulous Looney Tunes: Back In Action, amongst many others. There's also some other references in the movie: the theatre marquee is showing a double bill: ""A Boy's Life"" (the working title for Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial), and ""Watch the Skies"" (the working title for Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind). At the movie's finale the Gremlin leader, Stripe, hides from Billy in a pile of stuffed animals. A plush E.T. doll is shown prominently in the shot. This is a gag reference to the scene in Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, in which E.T. also evades discovery by hiding among plush toys.

I didn't spot this until it was pointed out, but while the father is talking on the phone from the inventor's convention, the machine from The Time Machine can be seen in the background winding up to full power. The scene cuts to the house, and when we cut back again, the machine has gone, leaving only a wisp of colored smoke.

Also, there are quite a few cameos in Gremlins, so next time you watch this, watch out for them! Steven Spielberg is the man in the electric wheelchair with a TV monitor. Chuck Jones is the man who looks at Billy's cartoon in the bar. There is a Warner Brothers cartoon playing on the TV. Jerry Goldsmith is at the inventors' conference, immediately behind actor Hoyt Axton in the phone booth. He's wearing a western hat with a mount for the phone. Rumoured to appear as a blink-and-you'll-miss-it-cameo too is George Lucas at the inventor's convention, riding a bicycle.

In Cantonese Chinese, mogwai means demon or gremlin. The Mandarin pronunciation is mogui.

The special edition of this DVD looks really good, with enough to keep a die-hard fan of extras going for ages. These are mostly your stereo-typical extras, but they include: commentary by Joe Dante, Phoebe Cates, Zach Galligan, Dick Miller and Howie Mandel; commentary by director Joe Dante, producer Michael Finnell and effects specialist Chris Walas; 10 minutes of never-before-seen footage; behind-the-scenes documentary; and photo/storyboard gallery. Two deleted scenes that were included on the Special Edition DVD appeared in some of the original merchandise for the movie. Since most such tie-ins received a script well in advance in order to have product at the time the movie premieres, several things may change within the picture in the meantime. The deleted extended opening is included in the first of 5 book and record sets that Hardee's released with their kids' meals. The scene with Judge Reinhold hiding in the bank vault was included in the trading card set. In addition to restoring the classic Warner Brothers logo to the opening of the movie, it was hoped to release the film along with the classic Looney Tunes short, Fallen Hare, where Bugs Bunny is harassed by a plane gremlin during WW II. This fell through, but, highlights from the short do appear as part of a making of special for the movie, that has also been included on the Special Edition DVD.

Little to no actual dialogue for the Gremlins and Mogwai exists in the script in itself. In addition to several instances of on stage rewrites changing or adding to much of the script, the voiceovers were all mostly ad libs, repeating snippets of just performed dialogue or in reaction to other sound effects or environment. To this end, Howie Mandel recorded Gizmo's lines phonetically for foreign dubs of the movie, where localized dialogue and in jokes helped make the picture successful with audiences world wide.

I'd highly recommend this movie now, although I'd be slightly wary of children seeing it, despite it being aimed at families. It definitely would have given me nightmares! It'll be interesting to see more Gizmo and his evil friends, and I'm glad that although this ends on a slightly bad note, the sequel should be better.",1102377600,,5227,4.712253829321663

Running Time: 106 minutes.
Rated PG for non-PG worthy-violence and some language; keep in mind that the MPAA Rating System created the PG-13 rating in 1985 largely due to this film and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"".
""Gremlins"" gets its title from the nickname given during World-War II to mysterious malfunctions that took place on American fighter planes.  No one could explain some of the break downs, so they determined that evil little monsters created by Japan were the culprits.  The 1984 film which is directed by Joe Dante (""Piranha""), written by Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") and executively created by the one-and-only Steven Spielberg (""E.T."", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""), inducing much media acclaim and criticism alike.  It is an extremely violent film for the rating and especially dark, but overall is a touching, terrifying story that works on all levels and became one of the most popular formula-producing horror films of the entire decade.
 A quirky inventor (Hoyt Axton) brings home a mysterious furry creature as a Christmas present for his son (played very well by newcomer Zach Galligan), not knowing the horrors that the purchase would later produce.  The furball is named Gizmo, which looks like a cross between a Kuala bear and a Cabbage-patch kid, is not only unique in appearance-it multiplies when exposed to water, hates the sight of light, and creates horrific, flesh-eating creatures when it is given food after the clock strikes midnight.  When Galligan accidentally feeds some of his pet's furry buddies, the little creatures morph into green, scaly little monsters that proceed to wreck havoc on the city and ruin Christmas.
Excellent special effects, a wonderfully hilarious script-writer Columbus, an exceptional musical score from composing genius Jerry Goldsmith, and top-notch direction from the veteran Dante-making ""Gremlins"" a ghoulishly scary comedic romp that is like no other.  Phoebe Cates is very good as the love interest of Galligan and Dick Miller is humorous as a paranoid, cranky war veteran.  A petrifying, splendid finish.  Special Note:  The film gives some special insight to the true spirit of Christmas-SHOULD NOT be viewed by children anyways, but especially those who still believe in Jolly Old Saint Nick.",1086134400,,2443,5.284237726098191

by now youve seen 100 reviews of the movie. So i'll skip that and just review what i think of the speichel edition.
The bonus features arnt really worth it. There is a couple of audio comentarys. The featurette is a short forgettable little thing from on the set, but don't expect there to be anything about how things where done or anything, its a featurette from while the movie was beeing made. The photos I never take intrest to. Theres 3 trailers, whoopie! and a few deleted scenes that are very forgettable, but most disapoitning about that, is if you listen to the audio commentary, they admit there are alot more deleted scenes that arnt on the disc!
Overall, I really don't see why this is called the special edition? It really should have been presented the way it is here in the first place. but there honestly isn't really anything special about it! its a basic DVD layout really! If your hanging out to see the bonus features, then you might be like me and just agree that there could have been much more?
But overall, the movie is still great, and thats always worth the price.... if your intrested in the bonus features, then go for this S.E version, if your not at all intrested....then the regular edition might be better, if it's cheaper? But this classic will always remain a classic!

934503,5,6304602898,"Some films are not what they seem. Take ""Gremlins"" (1984) for example. It is the story of a small-town kid who acquires a strange creature that spawns a pack of menacing green beings that terrorize the inhabitants of the cheery little area.
A silly idea, yes, but surely a fun one, and surely one to be cherished. It isn't technically a great movie, or even a very good one, but it doesn't mean to be. The genius lies in the modest scale of the film -- it isn't just a crude horror film with evil alien species (see ""Critters""), but a tongue-in-cheek parody of the rest, that still manages to fit in a few thrills along the way as if by accident.
Thank Joe Dante for this movie. And thank him for providing us with magnificent and imaginative films over the years. He is one of cinema's great underrated directors, the man responsible for bringing other creatures to life very often, whether it is werewolves or small toys or Looney Toons.
The movie is centered around Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), the small-town kid mentioned above who is handed a Mogwai by his father (Hoyt Axton), who picked the puffy furball up in Chinatown during one of his routine salesman trips. Billy's father is a sort of failed inventor, reminding us of the frizzle-haired Doc Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd in ""Back to the Future,"" only not quite as eccentric. ""Back to the Future"" came out a year after ""Gremlins,"" and the two are similar in the way they entertain -- silly little ideas that nevertheless become almost genius. Time travel was a myth before ""Back to the Future,"" which turned it into an adventurous notion, a way of being able to transport people back in time to see their own parents. (H.G. Wells himself hadn't even approached these topics, and I can guarantee he would have never sparked a relationship between the sibling and his mother.)
""Gremlins"" is milestone movie-making magic, a simple idea like ""Back to the Future,"" stretched out into a bigger picture. I won't kid you -- it's not as complex as ""Future"" is, but it doesn't need to be, and certainly doesn't want to be. It relies on humor and charm, and it has plenty of it.
Billy works at the town bank, hounded by the city grouch (Frances Lee McCain) and threatened by the vice president (Judge Reinhold). His long-time sweetheart (Phoebe Cates) works there, too, and at the local bar, occupied by drunks at night (and on occasion some nasty gremlins). The town loon (Dick Miller) is convinced there are gremlins about, and soon he is right.
""Don't ever get them wet,"" Billy is more or less told by his father. ""And don't feed them after midnight."" (See if you can spot the huge flaw in that rule.) Well, the small little Mogwai, Gizmo (voiced in burps and small cutesy sentences by Howie Mandel), does get wet, and spawns a set of fellow furballs -- all apparently mean-spirited and vile. And after tricking Billy by cutting the power on his clock, they get fed after midnight -- and basically evolve overnight into a bunch of green, nasty little gremlins, all of which continue to spawn throughout the town and cause absolute chaos.
Will Billy defeat the gremlins, get the girl, and save the town? Take a wild guess.
Everything Joe Dante touches is usually magic. Even his live-action/animation film ""Toy Soldiers"" was a load of fun because of its charming disposition. Dante doesn't try to make his films anything other than what they are -- charming and wildly, wickedly funny -- and that is undoubtedly the key to the outrageous success of ""Gremlins,"" one of the biggest box office moneymakers ever released.
I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original. It lost the darkness of campiness of the original and went for all-out laughs (many of which failed) instead of the laugh-out-loud laughs of the original, which were concealed within a film that actually made sense (in some ways) and still managed to be dark and fun. The sequel also introduced the mandatory Goofy Idiot Character. In fact, it had two -- a Donald Trump-like manager and a gremlin that more or less belonged in The Three Stooges, and definitely not in a movie about menacing creatures. In fact, another of the first film's highlights was the way it made its creatures dark, hurtful, and just plain funny. (People complained that the launching of Frances Lee McCain out a window was too much, but come on.)
As a whole, I didn't think that the sequel worked especially well. But it has as big a fan following as the original in some respects, for those who favor goofy, pointless cash-ins over original, hysterical movies.
I wouldn't expect many people to love ""Gremlins"" as much as I do, but its charm is certainly worth commenting on -- and so is its wicked humor. Dark, chaotic and pretty darn infectious, the film's sense of humor quickly kicks into boot even during the campy voice-over narrative. The whole film is campy. And unlike something like ""Critters"" (which I loathe), this film is endearing and fresh and funny and has a bunch of likable characters -- especially Gizmo, the favorite and most infamous little critter ever seen on screen, and Stripe, the lead gremlin whose unfortunate frying incident at the end of the film actually makes you sad. No sequel for that little creep.",1071964800,,5299,4.698924731182796
934504,4,6304602898,"Footnote: Official Actual Review: **** 1/4 stars (four and a quarter star rating)
In the summer of 1984 as Ivan Reitman's ceaselessly beloved supernatural box-office comedic powerhouse Ghostbusters was prevailingly netting all the profuse blockbuster revenues and inestimably enshrining itself adamantly with adoring audiences across all divides as the year's principally paramount money rainmaker of the year, a minor monster film B-Movie tribute to Capracorn and 1950's space paranoia exploitation flicks came into circulation at around the same time. Internationally released to movie theaters around the globe, Gremlins was an unappeasably premeditative liberating commandeering of the world's silver screens in one fell swoop of cinematic amnesty from the norm. Unhesitatingly conspiring and invigoratingly procuring to unhesitatingly unleash a mischievous torrent of cantankerously inconsolable scaly adversarial devils wantonly assailing restrained movie tastes with the provocatively stimulating rousing sensationalism of maliciously volatile foresight. Joe Dante's phenomenally lucrative massively unfashionable bold creative re-imaging of the exploitation genre sensationally ran amok with the general public as it universally grossed resoundingly beyond anyone's comprehension and beguilingly entranced millions more into an atypical personal connection with the film.

Dexterously consolidating into a whole new age of pop cultural advertising packaging integrating (beginning with Star Wars and exploding with E.T.), Gremlins was principally choked with indefinite unattributable mountains of merchandise. The Gizmo doll, Gremlin action figures, Gremlin lunch boxes, Gremlin posters, Gremlin story-time audio cassettes (do you remember those?) and all sorts of other cherished child and adult paraphernalia that became incredibly dispensed at an glaringly astronomical pace. Yet at the heart of this significant immeasurable love affair with the Gremlins and it's essential myth, lies ultimately the film itself. After nearly twenty years and untold droves of imbecilic rehashes, moronic re-shoots, and Kindergarten retreads, the film remains an indisputable pop culture cinematic touchstone classic of the 1980's. Directed by cinematic maverick satirist Joe Dante (Gremlins 2: The New Batch, The Howling, Looney Tunes: Back In Action) and executive produced by the omnipresent commercial dynamo of the 1980's Steven Spielberg, Gremlins is the uncanniest ironclad combination of subversive divine parody (Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life) and thrillingly riveting acute joyride (Howard Hawk's The Thing from Another World)
we've yet seen in the last generation of motion pictures.
Name me another picture that can so instantaneously, ambidextrously, and completely shift gears from brutal savagery to out-and-out comedic lunacy (just think of the Christmas Cookies/Blender Sequence) with the stunningly ghoulish extraordinary clout that Gremlins accomplishes without ever batting a reptilian eye. You may attribute this attractive charisma entirely to the Gremlins. However it's also Dante's steadfast no compromise craftsmanship that delivers the delicate balance of menace and perversity that remains so universally adored about this film to this very day by so many legions of fans and new viewers alike.
Overflowing with the quintessential Looney Tunes spirit of jovial irrelevance pulsating throughout its daffy festivities, the Gremlins bar sequence remains one of the single most mentally arresting moments of Eighties cinema. With it's gleeful lunatic goofiness taken to the very optimal zenith of cantankerous hilarity, this definitive burlesque showcase of pricelessly gut-busting spectacle lampoons the shear shallow splendor of binge drinking, chain-smoking, gluttony, high-stakes poker, Dashiell Hammett film noirs (The Big Sleep), misogynistic anarchy, the television show Cheers, urban crime, and Jennifer Beals's cheesy Flashdance renown to the absolute euphoric dizzyingly heights of galvanizing comedic possibilities.
Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates) chaotically desperate escape from the old-town movie house is an especially exceptional affectionately subversive amicable nod to Disney's masterwork Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1938). This singularly breathtaking climatic chase sequence remains a transcendental majestic tribute to the film medium's boundless past that remains supernaturally priceless beyond the mere mention of words, and blows continuing proof of Dante's ecstatically voracious exhilaration in ransacking the respectable into indelible comical genius. The exemplary majesty of Gremlins remains in it's devilish application of absurdity so effortlessly that it leaves many viewers blushing way beyond the restriction of age. Gremlins has carved its own permanent niche in American Pop Culture and it's definitely not likely to be carted away by any philosophical Asian mystic anytime soon.
As for the new Gremlins Special Edition DVD, it includes a 2001 remastering of the entire film with the inclusion of numerous extras including: a commendably impressive 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, a properly atmospheric Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track, an impressive Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround audio track, a charmingly nostalgic director and star commentary track featuring Joe Dante, Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Howie Mandel, and (Dante regular and greatly under-appreciated) Dick Miller, an intriguing director and special effects department commentary featuring Joe Dante, Michael Finnell (producer) and Chris Walas (Effects Supervisor), ten minutes of behind-the-scenes footages, theatrical trailer, and several other fascinating trappings to siphon through at your leisure.
P.S. Break-dancing Gremlins now that will be the day. Oh wait we do have hundreds of Agent Smiths, a skeletal Geoffrey Rush, a half-cranium mechanistic Schwarzenegger (was that a change?), and liquid medal invulnerable supermodels clamorously roaming around by now so who knows.",1069545600,,6052,6.1876484560570075

Those extras:
Commentary:  Not a bad job as Galligan, Cates, director Dante, and Mandel reminisce about the days on set.  Unfortunately Dick Miller was asked to participate as well, but pretty much only backs up everyone else's comments: ""Isn't that right, Dick?"", ""Yes, that's right"".  Galligan annoys a little with his endless ""Remember that, Pheebs?"", a total schoolboy crush in his voice.  But they didn't blow it, it's fun.  There's another track with Dante, Producer Finnell and FX man Walas, though not as fun as it's bogged down in technical aspects.

934542,5,6304602898,"The first time I saw this was on my birthday, at the theatres, no less.  I went to see it two more times after that.  The familiar concept of bringing the other, the unknown, the unique, to a picture postcard small town like Kingston Falls, is typical of aliens landing on Earth-type sci-fi.  OK, there is a difference between Chinatown and Mars, but still...
To say that Kingston Falls and indeed Billy Peltzer, the son of the man who brings the Mogwai Gizmo to town, will have the most memorable Christmas in its history is quite the understatement, and all because three strict rules regarding Gizmo are unwittingly ignored.  They are, keep him away from bright lights, keep him away from water, and never ever.... let him listen to Barry Manilow...just kidding, never ever feed him after midnight.  Guess what happens?
The glowing green and steam emerging from the YMCA swimming pool is the prelude of the mayhem that is to come from the red-eyed, growling, cackling reptilians, and who also seem to have full-time munchies.  Anyone happening to drive or walking on Christmas Eve happens to pick the wrong night to be human.  Contrast that with the ghastly neon glare of the red lights splashed on the Chinatown streets in one shot.  Red light for peaceful standby...green for go mayhem.
The adorable Gizmo's clearly the star in this It's A Wonderful Life meets Invasion Of The Body Snatchers/War Of The Worlds picture.  His facial expressions alone are very articulate, from his smiles, expressions of horror, sadness, and disgust, and a silly grimace when he's emulating Clark Gable in the racing car movie, To Please A Lady, which he's watching on TV.  Howie Mandel also deserves credit for providing Gizmo's voice.  And as he was raised by a Chinese man, it makes sense for him to have huang chung, or perfect pitch in the synthesizer scene.
Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates make a nice couple as Billy and Kate, but Hoyt Axton as Rand Peltzer has a great turn as an inventor who keeps on trying to find an invention that's marketable and isn't frustrated by setbacks to the Bathroom Buddy, a kind of Swiss Army Knife of toiletries.  He keeps on trying, as evidenced by the plethora of inventions in his household, such as the Peltzer Peeler Juicer (great scene), and the electric hammer.  And the phone remote kind of previews handheld cordless models so commonplace today.
Yet there's an undertone of enterpreneurial, corporate capitalism going on.  Rand Peltzer is an example of it for good.  Gerald's remarks to Billy is of the bad.  He boasts how he is a junior vice president of the bank at age 23.  ""At 25, I'll have Mr. Corben's [the president's] job.  At 30, I'm going to be a millionaire.  The world's changing, you gotta change with it.  You gotta be tough.""  And Mr. Futterman's jab at foreign cars reminds us of the trade gap between the US and Japan during the Reagan era, as well as the accompanying Japan-bashing.  And the rich and powerful harridan Ms. Deagle is a cariacature of robber barons meet Ebenezer Scrooge.  In fact the exchange between her and tenant Ms. Harris is a variation on Scrooge and Bob Crachitt.
Trivia notes:  note the Indiana Jones style writing on the Rockin' Ricky Rialto sign at the beginning, which figures, as both were Spielberg-Kennedy-Marshall productions.  And at the inventor's convention, executive producer Steven Spielberg, cast on his leg, wheels past Hoyt Axton watching TV on an electric sofa/wheelchair.  And the Coleco-vision Donkey Kong Stripe is playing is an example of 80's technology long gone.
Yes, another return visit to my golden decade.  Some aspects of this movie have not worn well.  The behaviour of the gremlins are rather uneven, ranging from extremely malicious (the traffic lights) to downright comical (the Christmas carolers, the different outfits worn by the gremlins), to the rare poetic justice (Mrs. Deagle).  But the otherworldly teddybear with elfin ears, whose furry hands grip the edge of the box he came in, then slowly raises his head for all to see, that's what I remember the most.

The movie open up when inventor Rand Peltzer(Hoyt Axton)is lead into a small curio shop in chinatown by the store owner's grandson.  Rand hears some strange noises coming from the back of the pet shop and heads back to see what it is.  The noises are eminating from a small furry creature called a 'Mogwai'.  Impressed with it, Mr. Peltzer offers $200 for it, but is told that it is not for sale.  ""With Mogwai comes much resposibility,"" says the shop owner. ""I cannot sell him at any price.""  The Chinese man's grandson, however, tells him to meet him outside with the money.  Once outside, he is handed the Mogwai. The kid then tells Mr. peltzer three rules he must remember: #1:Keep him out of the light, especially sunlight. #2: Don't get him wet, and the most important rule: NEVER feed him after midnight.
Rand comes back home and presents his son, Billy(Zach Galligan) the Mogwai, which he has christened 'Gizmo'.  Mom tries to take a picture of the Mogwai, thus breaking the first rule...and the other two will be broken in a matter of hours!  The next day, Billy's friend Pete spills water on the Mogwai, breaking the second rule.  When Mogwais are wet, they reproduce.  Soon, 5 new mogwais are born, one of which is named 'Stripe' due to a stipe of white hair running down his back.  That night, the Mogwais start making a ruckus for some food.  Billy checks his clock, which reads 11:00, so he gives the mogwais some left over chicken.  All of them eat it, except Gizmo.  The next morning, Billy wakes up to discover 5 sticky cocoons on the ground next to his bed.  His mother asks him if he fed the mogwai after midnight.  Billy checks his clock, which still reads 11:00.  The mogwais tricked him into feeding them after midnight by chewing through the power cord.

934547,3,6304602898,"I had remembered this movie as much better than it really is, having been a huge fan of the sequel for years.  Gremlins had a great concept, but it falls into an uncomfortable middle between children's movie and teenage comedy-horror, and the scripting and lighting are badly dated.
Chris Columbus script takes much of the blame for the insufferably cutesy small-townisms.  The stereotypes portrayed in this movie are pretty nasty at their core -- for example, the black high-school science teacher is so incredibly dumb that it looks like a racial statement, and the character of Mrs. Beagle, the inhumanly sadistic widow, is neither believable nor funny.  The pacing lags badly, and there is a sore lack of good dramatic scenes throughout the movie, especially in its languid second act before lead character Billy finally goes out into the town after the bad gremlins.  Zach Galligan is only mildly interesting in the lead (he would really come into life in the sequel), and Phoebe Cates is mostly window dressing, while Judge Reinhold's part was cut down to, mostly, one barroom scene and then, unfeasibly, disappears from the film entirely.
When this movie tries to make the gremlins a real monster threat, it doesn't work all that well.  On the other hand, Gremlins is hugely enjoyable when the gremlins are just acting like weirded-out humans.  The bar scene at Dorry's with the gremlins getting drunk and acting out is mostly hilarious (although the dated Flashdance spoof is a bit much), and the creatures look great.  Notably,Gizmo is less cutesy than he is in the second movie -- probably because the powers-that-be were trying to go for even more kid-oriented merchandising imagery in the second film.
While its flaws don't prevent Gremlins from being a pretty enjoyable movie overall, I felt this movie to be slow and a little thin almost two decades after I'd first seen it.  But in 1989 the sequel would turn the franchise on its head and correct every flaw -- and then some.",1030060800,,1990,4.901785714285714
934548,5,6304602898,"You really cannot easily classify GREMLINS into a particular genre. Is it a children's film? A comedy? A horror flick? It's a little of each, so there's something for everyone out there, and when added together, it makes for one entertaining package.
But let's talk about this ""Special Edition"" DVD. Unlike the previous edition that was released on DVD a few years ago, this one has quite a lot of features. The filmmaker's commentary is funny and informative, the actor's commentary, though less educational, is also amusing to listen to. Lead star Zach Galligan seems to have a photographic memory, as he remembers quite a lot about every scene he was in, and has a fun time reminiscing.
It's quite fortunate that instead of incorporating the deleted scenes into the film and coming out with a new cut of the film, they just add these as a supplement, since the scenes merely slow down the story. Watch out for Judge Reinhold in many of these scenes. His entire subplot practically got cut from the final version of the film.
The photogallery is easy to navigate, just forward and back buttons; the featurette is a 5 minute 1983 ""On The Set"" piece.
But the real collectible on this disc is the film itself. Unlike many films from the 1980s, this one does not feel dated. It has that little quality that makes it timeless. It's rare that a film can have you laughing hysterically one minute, then jumping out of your seat the next. This is simply mixed-genre filmmaking at its finest.",1029974400,,1485,4.693486590038314

It starts when an Asian man gives another man a cute little furry critter called a Gremlin named Gizmo, which he then gives to his son (Zach Galligan).  The father has been given important instructions: Don't get him wet, don't feed him after midnight, and don't expose him after midnight.  The son accidentally gets him wet, and little furballs come out of him, which become Gremlins just like Gizmo.  They are very cool just like him, but then the guy accidentally feeds all of them, but Gizmo, after midnight, because his clock says 11:30, but the cord was bitten by the Gremlins.  They then become evil and ugly, and destroy much of the town.  Galligan and his friend (Phoebe Cates, Drop Dead Fred) must stop them before it's too late.

Time (and the box office) proved them wrong, and ""Gremlins"" turned out to be an 1980's classic. Like me, there are many people who still cherish the memory of those little green monsters that turned Christmas into an orgy of mayhem. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't go beyond there. I must say that, having watched it again recently, many years after its release, it didn't thrill me as it did before, but I bought the DVD because I'm just a nostalgic sap and wanted to have a piece of my childhood in my collection. As for the edition, it didn't pass the test. The picture and sound quality is just a light improvement over the VHS version, and there are very few features. I was very excited when I saw there was a ""Behind the scenes"" material, but it wasn't a documentary, as I believed, only a text (sorry, folks). At least, the movie has Spanish subtitles.

The boy who sold Billy's father Gizmo gave him three rules to follow.  One was to avoid sunlight with him because it could kill him.  The next one was not to get him wet, and the final was to never EVER feed him after midnight, but he didn't explain why.  When he accidentally gets wet though, he spawns others like him, except they are very mischievious.  They later then trick Billy into giving them food after midnight, and they metamorph into reptilian gremlins with large teeth and claws, and the runamok through the suburban town.

934610,5,6304602898,"I'm a sucker for dark comedies. I'm a sucker for horror films. I'm a sucker for movies with lots of inside jokes. In other words, I'm dead center of Joe Dante's target demographic.

This movie has it all. It starts out like an homage to ""It's A Wonderful Life"", then things start getting weird. Amid lots of cool cameos and typical Joe Dante background action (always watch what TV's are playing in the background of any scene in a Dante film), the film begins taking an ominous turn.

Adeptly, Dante keeps his options open far past when you'd expect him to have to commit, so you're over halfway through before you know for sure whether it's going to be funny or creepy. The decision is signaled with the comic execution of the show's least likable character. From there, it's simply the funniest film ever made.

I especially love the cameos - Chuck Jones, Steven Spielberg, Robby the Robot, the Time Machine (check out the background action in *that* scene!), ""Show White"", and the list goes on. The casting of both major and minor characters is perfect, with lots of recognizable veterans along with Joe Dante regulars such as Dick Miller. The deliciously evil mayhem of the gremlins themselves leaves no icon of popular culture untapped.

Many have claimed that the sequel was better, but I have to disagree. For me, the contrast between the Capra-esque backdrop and the ""What type of film is this?"" treatment are what elevate it to greatness. The sequel lacked both qualities. It's also not going to be as popular with critics who like to be able to categorize any film within the first 15 minutes.

I can't recommend it highly enough! I'd especially recommend it as the ultimate anti-Christmas movie for when it's late December and you're getting really burned out on forced cheerfulness.

Update:
Ok, after decades in the top spot, Gremlins has lost that honor to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which I consider to be a single movie). Still, I've been watching movies for a half century plus, so 2nd place isn't too shabby! It still holds the record as the film I saw the most times in a theater - I paid for 12 tickets before I figured I'd caught enough of the gags going on in the background or periphery.

Later update:
If you consider the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as a single film, or even the complete series of  ""Babylon 5"", they have supassed ""Gremlins"" as my favorite. But ""Gremlins"" remains my all-time favorite single film - i.e. watchable in a single sitting.",982972800,,2481,4.674311926605505

The gremlins were hilarious in their mischievous invasion of  town.  And their deaths were just plain gross.  But that was half the fun.  The best part, however, was Gizmo, he made the movie.  Parents might want  to watch this one first before letting really small children sit down in  front of the tube, it might just be a little too intense for the wee ones.  Anyone over 7 should be able to handle it though, but be prepared to check  under the bed, in the closet, and in every conceivable crevice before your  child will let you turn out the lights after watching this.

Gremlins is very coolmovie. Although it's somewhat dated and the sequel was a lot better,it's still a very cool movie that's well worth checking out. The story is very well written and highly creative. A Dad spots a cute lttle furry animal named Gizmo,who's from a weird line of creatures called Mogwais. He wants to buy it for his son Billy,but Gizmo's owner won't let him have Gizmo. The owner's son snatchs Gizmo and gives him to the Dad. The Dad is told a set of three rules that he must follow no matter what. 1,keep Gizmo as far away from water as possible (this includes anything with liquid).2,keep him far away from bright lights. And 3,never,ever feed him after Midnight. Billy receives Gizmo as a Christmas present. He accidently spills water on Gizmo,which causes him to spawn other Mogwais. One night,all of the Mogwais (except Gizmo) break a very important rule. They eat chicken after Midnight. This causes them to transform into scaly,vicious beasts who wreak havoc on Billy's hometown,Kingston Falls. The mutant Mogwais are called Gremlins. They attack people,hold Bartenders hostage,drive construction vehicles,and even employ some weapons in the process,including chainsaws,six-barreled pistols,and tennis ball serving machines. The special F/X are great. Although their a bit corny compared to some of the other monsters we see Today,they still are very well done. The Gremlin F/X are very cool. (...) The acting is very good and convincing. The direction from Dante is very tight and solid. Overall,Gremlins is a simply good movie. Although the sequel,Gremlins 2:The New Batch was much better in my opinion,I still liked Gremlins 1 very much. It's just somewhat dated. On a side note,although Gremlins is targeted towards kids,it's pretty violent. The Gremlins look really scary and nasty,and there's even some gore (this includes some human characters who dies during the Gremlins rampge on the town). It's a very nasty and scary movie for young kids,but older kids (9+) probably won't be too scared.

934650,5,6304602898,"A dark, crazy, twisted, inventive, and violent Christmas classic. There's really no way to classify or categorize Gremlins. It's too mean-spirited to be a kid's film, but not quite intense enough to justify a higher rating (but the 15-rated UK version makes a mockery of the BBFC guidelines).

Gremlins has long been an annual tradition for movie fans. The cozy, snowy atmosphere of Kingston Falls (which appears to be in upstate New York somewhere) is the perfect small town that we all wish we came from. Even when the Gremlins invade it's a homely place to be envious of.

I was frightened of the Gremlins when I was a kid, but they're really nothing more than gigantic smiles with arms and legs. They exist only to have fun at the expense of human life and private property. I suppose they could be a metaphor for hedonism or apathy.

Originally a much more evil script (intended to be an anti-Wonderful Life), Chris Columbus was inspired to write Gremlins as he listened to the rats in his apartment scurry about in the dark during the night. He lightened the material somewhat before filming began, but Joe Dante's wild vision makes it a twisted, festive reality.

Special mention must be made of Jerry Goldsmith's outrageous score and that famous theme tune 'The Gremlin Rag', a demented circus fanfare of anarchy and mayhem. It's crazy to think that over 26 years later it's still never been released on CD.

Gremlins sparked the rise of Chris Columbus as a creative force in Hollywood. Only 25 at the time of filming his career has been made up of classics, and Christmas classics, such as The Goonies, Young Sherlock Holmes, Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Harry Potter, and Bicentennial Man. Joe Dante never scored a bigger hit, but his subsequent career significant;y defined 80s and 90s cinema with movies such as Innerspace, The 'burbs, Gremlins 2, and Small Soldiers. Goldsmith scoring every one of them until his death in 2004.

Neither of them knew the massive franchise and fan-following which Gremlins would provoke, but it certainly deserves it's place in pop culture history.

A lot of criticism has been made of the Blu Ray. I admit that it doesn't look like Avatar but no matter what anyone says it is a significant step-up from the DVD. The 1.78:1 1080p picture is the best Gremlins has ever looked. It's always been a dark, grainy-looking film, so I'm not as unimpressed as other reviewers have been. The Dolby TrueHD sound is also a noticeable upgrade from the DVD too. Extras are ported over from the Special Editon and are in standard definition.",957312000,,2568,4.783295711060948
934651,3,6304602898,"If you've never seen the film: Gremlins is very barely a horror flick, though, ironically, it had the most to do with the invention of the PG13 rating in 1984.  There is an excessive number of pointless sightgags [and a few subtle and clever ones, including A BOY'S LIFE playing at the cinema]  and childish sound effects.  Kids *over* thirteen will be insulted by a lot  of this film.
That aside, it was a fairly original idea...which has been  exploited everywhere else, since; you might as well see where it  began.
Regarding the DV: the missing scenes [Reinhold locking himself in  the safe, et cetera] aren't on the disc, which is disappointing; the best  parts of the film have been removed, and can't be found anywhere right now.  The DV also passed on the obvious chance to include a desktop theme for  DVRoms, which might have been amusing.
As for the gremlins  themselves--since that's what I'm apparently some sort of expert  on--they're far more interesting than the one who beat up Bugs Bunny; but  the best gremlin I've seen was in the cinematic Twilight Zone  release.
Gremlins is a fun escape from life for ninety minutes; suspend  disbelief, and any problemsolving ability you may have, and you'll be  fine.
