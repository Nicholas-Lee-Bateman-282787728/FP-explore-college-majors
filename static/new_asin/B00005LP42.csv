1623194,5,B00005LP42,"All hail Ikuhara!  If you weren't awed by his directorial prowess in the series, then you will be stunned by the achievement that is Adolescence Mokushiroku.  The movie follows the same basic story as the series -- girl needs to bring world revolution, and loses her innocence along the way -- but because it is animated, there is no limit to how far one can stretch things to get the point across.  Ikuhara doesn't hold back.  Akio is smarmier, Anthy is weirder, the Student Council is even more neurotic... and the Castle of Illusions is even more surreal, if it's at all possible.  I honestly believe that in a hundred years comparative literature majors will be doing dissertations on the implications of the movie.  To call it a ""must see"" for anime fans is an understatement.  This IS animation at its finest, and while you don't have to like it or understand it, you can't help but appreciate it. (Rating is for the movie, not the DVD itself as I don't own it yet :)",992822400,2,973,4.525714285714286
1623195,5,B00005LP42,"I have seen the movie of Revolutionary Girl Utena on Video, and I can hardly wait for it to come out on DVD! This movie was absolutly amazing!!  The animation is gourgeous and the story is surreal, but very very good!  The whole movie is just done remarkably well!  My brother loved it, and he's not a real big anime fan. The movie is sort of a re-telling of the series with a few... well, alot of changes.  Anthy is almost completly different.  At First I was a little diapointed that it didn't follow the Series, but once I understood that it was mearly a new way to tell the story, I really enjoyed it.  It is a must see for any Utena fan... or anybody who likes a real brain twister anime.",992390400,,693,4.172932330827067
1623196,5,B00005LP42,"I purchased Utena back in the 90's when it was still being released on VHS. The only reason i purchased it was because on the box it said from the director of Sailor Moon, so i assumed it was another great series. Indeed it was, but a GREAT SERIES in a totally different way from Sailor Moon. The series started and then stopped after only 13 episodes and the remaining episodes were released a few years later to coincide with the release of the movie on DVD. After the cancellation of the VHS tapes I assumed Utena was another anime title that would never see the light of day as with many anime titles that get dubbed and never to be seen again. I was ecstatic when I found out the original cast had returned to finished out the 39 episode season. I just love Utena and i think it's one of the best series ever released. It has mystery and it keeps your attention. The only thing is a lot of elements in the show and movie is interpretive, so you never really quite know what's going on; everything is open to what you think it symbolizes. This can be a bit confusing. After watching the series i thought the movie would answer all my questions but only gave me more questions as i didn't know how to interpret what the symbols mean. Regardless, i still think the movie is excellent and the animation of course is amazing as well. The movie is like the show condensed into 85 minutes but with a somewhat new ending to help bring closure to the series. As stated before it still doesn't tell you the answer out right, you have to figure it out for yourself. Quick recap: The show/movie is about a girl name Utena that comes to the Ohtohori Academy and gets involved with these duels because she has a rose crusted ring that a prince gave her when she was little. She feels the ring is the only connection she has into finding him and through these duels she hopes that she can find the answers that she's looking for. Along the way the winner of the duels get complete control over the Rose Bride Anthy. Anthy is complex and doesn't say much. But as much as the show has a light fluffy fairy type feel to it, it quickly turns into a tragic nightmare as the episodes progress. The show is excellent in terms of PLOT, structure, and EXCELLENT MUSIC, addictive Japanese Techno Opera. But check this movie out and the series. This DVD is the best way to complete your Utena collection. Just series & movie is a masterpiece and I only wish there was a season 2.",1217894400,,2458,4.334056399132321
1623197,3,B00005LP42,"Having watched the 39 episode series, read several essays, and considered the show at length, I would have to say that overall the Utena movie is a disappointment. Actually, my first exposure to Utena was the movie, back in 2002, which made no sense to me at all and which I dismissed as ridiculous. It took five years before I was willing to actually look at the series, which is brilliant and amazing. I then watched the movie a second time, after the TV series and, while it made more sense, it is still ridiculous.

The first thing I thought of after seeing the movie the second time is that Kunihiko Ikuhara was not able to resist ""Evangelion-izing"" Utena, with the same sad results. To highlight some obscure part of the original creation or to extend it is some way would have been reasonable,  but to try to compact it into 80 minutes in any meaningful way is sophomoric. I will say that the resulting mashup does come across as adolescent, especially the sexualization of the characters, so the alternative movie title (The Adolescence of Utena) is at least appropriately named.

As with other reviewers, I will agree that the music and graphics are superior to the series. However, if I wanted to view a Utena music video, there are many on YouTube that are far better. Perhaps the best thing I can say is that the movie allows you to hang out with the characters from the series in new and unique ways, as long as you do not require that to make any sense. I love symbolism and allegory, but stringing them together in a linear fashion does not tell a story and is not necessarily worth the emotional or real-time investment, unless your looking for some easy fan-service.

Overall, I am glad I saw the movie, since it clarifies some things from the series (that the Academy is more prison than school, that Touga did have potential to be more than just a playboy, that Shiori was more of a witch than Anthy ever was). But it adds nothing to one's appreciation of the series, which is the true masterwork. I highly recommend you invest in watching the series - it will shatter your preconceptions about gender roles and the insidious romantic mythology we all participate in.",1195603200,,2186,4.597435897435897
1623198,5,B00005LP42,It's really amazing how it has so many levels to this movie it's more than meet's the eye.  There is the story you see and the story it means.  It may seem strange while watching but the more you think about it it begins to make more sense and the more you like it.  This is worth watching and adding to any anime collection.,1190937600,,325,4.046875
1623199,5,B00005LP42,"I think for some who watch the original 1st season of Revolutionary Girl Utena would be disappointed because they thought it was all going to end quickly with just a movie. But, I strongly recommend that you watch the previous seasons of ""The Black Rose Saga"" and ""The Apocalypse Saga"". From what I've seen in this movie, the colors are brilliant comparing to the TV series. The music is beautiful and nostalgic. ""This Rose is Our Destiny"" song was beautiful, whether you're a j-pop fan or not you'll love it. There were parts in the movie that can be confusing like the character's new modified looks, the setting, and story. Well, just think of it as a retelling the Utena series in a whole new way. You may think that the previous 1st series was just all teenager pheremones and stuff. But, this does deserve the title ""Innocence Lost"". Even Utena let's loose her anger on Anthy because of her childhood boyfriend. In The 1st series she never considered Touga as a boyfriend but a ""playboy"" (which is true, speaking the fact that he was messing with other girls).

Alot of things well be unveiled in different plots and shocks. The special feautures were the best part including my favorite theatrical trailer of ""La Fillette Revolutionaire UTENA"" w/the Gravitational Mix ""Absolute Destiny of Apocalypse"". Kunihiko Ikuhara in his ""Behind the Scenes"" and commentary explained alot of what's going on and the movie's new meaning.

So check it out! And be in awe with a world without innocence.",1140652800,,1494,4.809338521400778
1623200,5,B00005LP42,"I love the series it has 39 episodes and I love the movie. I would rate it pg-13. The animation is just average but I still love this movie it has drama, comedy, action, and some mature themes.",1122336000,,193,4.105263157894737
1623201,5,B00005LP42,"I have all the Utena DVD's; all 39 episdoes and let me just say, this anime is AMAZING!! It is by-far my favorite anime... If you were debating over wheter to get this anime or not, get it. It's fabulous!! BUY IT NOW!!",1102636800,,218,4.093023255813954
1623202,1,B00005LP42,"Having been a fan of the entire series of Revolutionary Girl Utena I would advise any like-minded fan to avoid this movie.  Granted the artwork is beautiful and a serious collector would likely be interested in owning it. However, many things have changed from the original series.  The relationship between Utena and Anthy has turned dark and calculating and the other stories are too rushed and somber for this film.  Plus you only get to witness a few duals with very little ""sword magic"" and the ending will leave you completely wondering why you wasted money on this and why the director wasted his chance to make a movie based on his truly wonderful series.",1092960000,3,663,4.747826086956522
1623203,5,B00005LP42,"""Utena - the Movie"" is a masterpiece, brilliant in color and concept, and fascinating in its plot and meanings. Of course, if you want connect-the-dots animation and plotting, or if you think that Utena and Anthy are sweet little teenagers, then you'll hate it, but this film was made for viewers who will want to see it again and again to puzzle out its secrets and mysteries. And ""Utena"" has secrets as well as some of the most gorgeous animation ever done, like the dance sequence and the final car chase. --- The film operates on two distinct, but interpenetrating registers. One is symbolic, and the other surrealist. Utena and Anthy, now older than they were in the television show, have once again met at Ohtori Academy, once again to find each other in a kind of karmic repetition of their past lives. Symbols of the past echo throughout the film as dying monuments. Utena's no-longer-really alive, once-boyfriend/lover Touga emerges from white shrouds to talk on the phone to Anthy's equally dead brother Akio, the unprincipled headmaster of a previous Ohtori Academy that nonetheless still enslaves Anthy. Crimson roses grow on a platform cantilevered high above Ohtori, tended by Anthy, still the Rose Bride to be won by duel. And splashes of blood red crimson stain not only the roses but the walls and walkways of the surreal world of Ohtori. The crimson of the roses is also the crimson of Anthy's blood, but the rose that Utena finds and that Anthy gives to her is white: unstained. It is a symbol of their undying love, loyalty, and interwoven fates. --- The film lacks the virtually Wagnerian high drama of the television show. Instead, it is more modern (as befits the reprise of Utena and Anthy's love story) and sharper edged, not absurdist, but surreal. The architecture of Ohtori Academy looks like a cross between de Chirico and a mecha designer gone mad, but that's Ohtori for you, the world from which Utena and Anthy escape. --- At one level, the film is simply the story of two young women who escape the repressions of adolescence to find themselves and each other. At another, it is an allegory of love, this between two women who will build their own roads together. At yet another, it is a portrayal of sexuality, warped and truly corrupt within Ohtori Academy, and centered and intimate between Utena and Anthy outside Ohtori. Ohtori is the world of consensus reality, and of acceptance of what is given and commanded, in brief, all the things that Utena and Anthy must escape. The Castle of Eternity, previously a hoped-for panacea for instant happiness, is now a polluting illusion, corrupt and lethal. It represents all that Utena and Anthy must destroy if they are to become real people, genuine and authentic. --- That the film succeeds in all this, and much more (the music is marvelous), is a tribute to the skills of director Kunihiko Ikuhara and artist Chiho Saito, the woman who drew the original manga. It is not necessary to know the previous versions, although that adds depth to the film, because ultimately the film stands alone: the story of two young women in love who find their way to freedom.",1072137600,28,3144,4.78125
1623204,5,B00005LP42,"I loved Shoujo Kakumei Utena (best known as Revolutionary Girl Utena) ever since I first watched it...renting a dubbed tape from Blockbuster. Utena is a wonderful series, and it puzzles us again and again with new twists and turns that make it enjoyable to watch over and over again to try and figure it out, and this is also a good reason to watch it with a close friend.
The same goes for the movie, I believe. It is...confusing, to say the least, if you haven't seen at *least* to the Black Rose Saga. I, myself, bought the dubbed tape of this movie when I had only seen the first four episodes from Blockbuster. This was a mistake. However, I enjoyed the movie anyway, and also ending up buying the DVD later on (which has the better Japanese subbed version).
Most people give this movie a 2 or 3 star rating. The art alone is enough to give it a 3, I think. It's wonderful, and even if you don't understand it, it's just plain beautiful to watch over and over again. True, there are some images in there that I'd rather not see, but all in all, it's worth it. My most favorite scene (which seems to be everyone else's as well) is the rose garden scene, where Utena and Anshi dance. It's worth buying this just to see the scene. The music is wonderful, which is why I have the soundtrack to this as well.
This is *not* a movie to watch if you either haven't got a clue what Utena is, or haven't had someone explain it to you with some depth. I will not lie, Utena is a very complicated story. As I stated before, there are many levels of this movie that I still haven't gotten, even after watching it over and over again. However, some of the movie ties together, although it does so loosely--you must pay attention to every detail or you'll miss it. I also think that the characters were a little...strange, namely Anshi. But this didn't stop me from liking it. I discarded trying to figure it out watching it the first time and just let it flow over me, enjoying the astounding graphics and flowing music. Save trying to understand it for the second time you view it.
I suggest this DVD to anyone who has a slight interest in Utena who has seen it before. Even though you might not have seen all of it, I'm sure it will come together once you have seen all of the series. It might come off as a very shoujo-like series (i.e. Salior Moon), but it can appeal to males as well as females. I hope you'll take the time to let it soak in before you sell it to somebody two days after you buy it. 'Cause that's just wasted time, you know?",1068422400,,2537,4.265560165975104
1623205,5,B00005LP42,"I was immensley pleased when I heard that the Utena movie was coming out in America, being a very big fan of the original series and manga. At first seeing the movie, I was not dissapointed one little bit.
The animation in this movie is supurb. Beautiful, rich, crisp images captivate your eyes throughout the entire movie. The graphic qaulity of this movie is in the same leauge as any Miyazaki movie, which is very good indeed. Even now, several years after the first release the movie visual capasity of this movie is better than most anime movies and series. In no way was the animation flawed at all. I especialy loved the dance scene between Utena and Anshii, which in my view is one of the most graphicly beautiful in all of anime, and certainly the highlight of the movie.
The plot of the movie is based losely on the anime and manga series Shojo Kakumei Utena, or Revolutionary Girl Utena in English. The major theme of the plot is the same, Utena getting involved in the duels to keep possesion of the Rose Bride, Himemiya Anshii (in Japanese, last name then first name). And soon Utena and Anshii develope a very close friendship. That is one thing that the series has over the movie, it is that the relationship in the movie is lesbian, unlike in the series when the two are always trying to keep their feelings to themselves. Also unlike in the series which the movie is superior to it, is that Utena is clearly in love with Anshii, and she isn't being torn between either Touga or Anshii. That part of the series really bugged me, and the movie dosen't do that. However one flaw in the plot is that the movie presents Saionji as some insane woman beater. Although he has that outward apperence, it dosen't give his rather sad story like it dose in the show that shows exactly why Saionji is the way he is. Even the part at the end when Utena is morphed into a car for her and Anshii to escape in is wonderfully original and creative.
Each of the characters is wonderful and has their own original personality. Utena's personality is kept pretty much the same in the anime and in the movie, which was fine with me. However, Anshii lost her 'gone with the wind' type of attitude that she held in the manga and series. After a while you get used to the personality change, and learn to like her new character. Touga and Shiori's character are kept pretty much the same, in which I can't stand Shiori. Although I don't remember Touga taking much of an interest in Shiori as he dose in the movie. Juri and Miki aren't really mentioned much so there really isn't a whole lot that changed in their character, and for some odd reason Miki still has that blasted stopwatch.
Sound wise, the Japanese version was suberb while the English dub had some problems. Okay maybe more than some problems. Alright, the English version had A LOT of problems. While the dubbers kept the music the same, all of the voices made me want to chringe. Utena's voice was okay, there was a lot of room for improvment, but I delt with it. I could of pee'ed my self when I heard Anshii, Saionji, and Touga's English voice. They were AWFUL. The only good thing about the English dubb is that Miki for once, sounds like a guy. I never got why in the original he sounds like a girl. Not neccicarily a good voice that matched his character, but it was a masculine voice anyway.
Overall, The Shojo Kakumei Utena movie, or The Adolesence of Utena was a wonderful movie. For any Utena fans out there it is a must see. I would not recomend that you watch this unless you have seen at least all the way through the Black Rose Arc and the Akio Arc in the series Shojo Kakumei Utena. If not you WILL be lost and confused. When I showed this to my friend, who had not seen the show Utena but knew the basic plot information, she was VERY lost in the movie plot. Also, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOUNGER AUDIENCES. PLEASE HEED THE PG-13 RATING. Like I said, this movie is a must see for any Utena fan, weither you like the manga version of anime, The Adolesence of Utena is a wonderful movie, with a lovely images, a creative plot, and awsome characters.",1060041600,7,4118,4.405511811023622
1623206,5,B00005LP42,"I have watched this movie three times since I purchased it. I watched it once in English the same day I bought it, then again in Japanese. It completely confused me. However, after watching the entire series so far and then viewing it again I can now understand and appreciate it. It is a marvelously animated and depicted RETELLING of the anime series. Certain characters change personalities but the essence of the Utena series remains, Revolution.
One thing to keep in mind when viewing Japanese anime and cinema is that you most likely prescribe to the western idea of symbolism. So if for example you see Utena turn into a car you may think that it must be symbol of power or speed but feel uncertain, when in fact all it is is transportation. Get it.
I highly suggest buying this movie after you have watch most of the series (through entire black rose saga) and then you may be able to grasp some of what it going on.
It's nice to see a movie that isn't afraid of stepping outside the boundries of the series because when you hold yourself to that mold you can only go so far. This movie is an exploration into many lingering ideas in the series. That is why it's a must see for Utena's fans, dubbed and subtitled alike.",1058054400,,1227,4.433628318584071
1623207,5,B00005LP42,"Hi, I own a copy of this movie now. I haven't seen the tv series so I can't compare them really, but i can give an honest opinion about this film. This is one of the most interesting Anime films I have ever seen. The movie itself is visually stunning, and the characters have many layers to them. Also, the cover design could be better...the cover doesn't represent the film that well (the cover image and lettering is a bit cheezie).
Utena is very memorable as a character and inspirational, and the film challenges both femininity and masculinity in a new way. I perhaps interpret the film differently than most and it is ok because the film is very open to interpretations. That, in my opinion, is true art. This film includes a sequence in which Utena turns into a race car. I will not give away what happens but it blew my mind. I feel that Utena is more sophisticated as a person than the Sailor Moon character. The film gives a lot of information about the characters at once, but it is not impossible to figure out what is going on. This is definitely worth seeing.",1052524800,,1073,4.424242424242424
1623208,2,B00005LP42,"First of all, I loved, loved LOVED the series.  What this movie has going for it has gorgeous imagery and the same caliber of voice talent of the series, but otherwise it fails in all the ways the series was intriguing and, well, likeable.  Anthy's character is, instead of the tortured creature of the series, a flirtacious, giggly schoolgirl who practically forces herself on Utena and evokes little sympathy to carry us through to the ending.  Much of the dialogue, heck, entire scenes are utterly incoherent to those who haven't seen the entire series.  The seductive manipulation of Akio- gone.  The well-developed modern mythology?  Gone.  The deep backstories and character insights?  Gone.  In a word, this movie, as a condensed storyline, managed to suck the wonderful aspects of the show out, which leaves a pretty but feeble creature of a movie behind.",1051401600,,863,5.02112676056338
1623209,5,B00005LP42,"We believe whatever we want to believe.  My opinion?  This is perhaps one of the better anime out there.  The plot is intriguing, the characters are wonderful and a good change from the television series version, and the imageries are luscious.  On one level this movie is not hard to understand.  At the same time however, it can be interpreted in many different ways.  Perhaps this is echoing the wish of Ikuhara-sama but i do hope that people watch this movie with an open-mind and think outside what one has been taught and the rules we abide by.  Changing mentality in a way, like a revolution but for the mind.
All in all, this is a wonderful movie:)",1050624000,,656,4.508474576271187
1623210,5,B00005LP42,"The Revolutionary Girl Utena series has acquired fame as one of the strangest anime series ever made. Nearly everything in the show is metaphorical or an allusion to something else outside of the show (indeed, even outside of some people's thought processes!). The movie is no different. Don't be afraid if you don't understand a lot of the symbols--understanding comes with time and many repeat viewings (at least it did for me). You don't need to know a single thing about the Utena series to watch this movie. Oh, and for you parents and the few prudes out there, this movie does have some nudity, lesbianism, and (very, very slight) incest, so keep an eye out. But for those of you that are old enough and mature enough to handle a little skin or two girls being romantically involved with each other or a few hundred allegorical symbols, then you won't be disappointed in the Revolutionary Girl Utena movie.
You will be pleasently surprised with a good portion of the show. The use of the pictures to form a bigger picture was nicely done, although they should have let us see the smaller pictures in their frames. The Shadow Girls also have a purpose, so don't dismiss them out of hand.
By the way, I suggest watching this in it's original Japanese format with English subtitles. Unlike the series, which had great dubbing, the movie's dub should be taken out and burned.",1043280000,2,1377,4.694214876033058
1623211,5,B00005LP42,"I'm just getting hooked into Anime & this is the BEST film in my collection. I admit that I've never seen the series, but the movie blew me away. It full of so much symbolism, has great music, and captivating artwork. Ikuhara-san has created a movie of epic proportions. There's never a dull moment and the film keeps you thinking throughout. Many people argue that it's controversial, since it deals with drug-rape, lesbians, incest, and a number of other risque topics, but it's all completely symbolic and important to the storyline. It underscores any adolescent's feelings in someway,and is probably adquately rated @ about PG-13. It's really an awe-inspiring movie.",1038787200,2,671,5.109090909090909
1623212,4,B00005LP42,"Utena the movie... well. First of all, the series and the movie have little to do with each other, excepting the characters, so seeing the series is not a prerequisite to watching the movie.

 Now that we've gotten that out of the way, to the actual review: The movie is largely incomprehensable (the car scene is especially...odd...) but that really doesn't detract from it that much- Utena is expected to be slightly surreal. The animation is beautiful, and if you get REALLY lost, you can always just look at the pictures. :)

 There ARE some dark elements in Utena, but they are mainly implied, and anybody that doesn't already have an idea of what is going on in those scenes isn't going to find out from watching this- it isn't going to corrupt anybody.

 All in all, this is the kind of movie you watch late at night with a bowl of popcorn and your friends beside you- a lovely mind-trip sort of anime that you don't have to worry about understanding- it's nigh near impossible anyway, so just sit back and enjoy the show!

 The beauty of the dance scene is reason enough to buy this title all by itself, and the rest of the movie is just as enjoyable. Even if it is difficult to understand.",1038614400,,1198,4.463302752293578
1623213,2,B00005LP42,"I originally saw this movie right after finishing the 39 episode series without any expectations.  I found that it was an alternate storyline, and although it is separate from the series--- it has a lot of little inside jokes and things that don't make much sense if you haven't watched the full series first.
Getting down to it all... I have to be a little harsh with this movie-----aside from original character designs, the original author, Chiho Saito, didn't appear to have her hand in this one.
The story line seems to revolve around Utena's relationship to Himemiya and how it changes over time.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a lot of progression---this being an 80 minute movie-----things seem to jump forward very quickly---leaving you kind of wondering ""Why are they all the sudden so close?""  In the movie---it seems as if Utena and Himemiya have only know each other for maybe a week or so---but they quickly jump into a relationship with each other that seems sacrificial and unrealistic.  The whole thing just feels very rushed and poorly written.
And now the car sequence..... the last 20 minutes or so... are very unusual.  I really felt bored by it all------ the reason Utena is so attractive is because it's very much like a dramatic, yet beautiful, fairy-tale.  They COMPLETELY change the feel on it though and set it to absurdity.  Not amusing absurdity either, but just bland and ridiculous.
I'm sorry, I am a HARDCORE fan of Utena, it's my favorite anime series and the manga is of the best I've read-------but the movie was not even slightly redeeming.  The ONLY THING that I enjoyed was the music------- but if you really wanna hear the music just buy the OST.",1031443200,,1695,4.780821917808219
1623214,2,B00005LP42,"That was approximately my thought watching this movie, along with ""What have they done to Utena and Anthy's hair!"" If you're a fan of the manga, you might not want to touch this thing with less than a ten foot pole, and as for watching it, well, that's better left to others who haven't read the books.
The movie seems to have taken the outlines of their characters and their general discription (Utena's boyishness and Anthy's relative meekness) and also the fact that the manga had something to do with roses and dueling. Other than that, they seemed to have been reading off of a completely different script! Very, very few things were the same in the manga and the movie, and other parts of the movie were just extreame in the fact it seemed the makers weren't entirely sure what their characters were doing in the different parts, or even in one character's case, if he was alive or not!
The graphics on this movie could have been its saving point, but unfortunately they fall short also. While the oddly moving school is somewhat nicely done and the rose shots are beautiful, the people themselves often appear distorted in very dissapointing ways.
One major perk of the movie that saved it from getting 1 star is the music, which really is exceptional, and maybe worth viewing the movie again just to listen to. The added clips on the DVD are also not too bad- the questionare is incredibly funny, and the drawings and clips of other movies are also nice.
Overall, this is a movie you may want to rent, but certainly not buy unless you are a major fan, or out to own all anime videos. Some otakus may find this enjoyable if they really like movies like this, or the challange of watching it a few times to figure out what really is going on.",1030233600,3,1748,4.5
1623215,3,B00005LP42,"I ordered Utena the movie from a huge raw manga and anime video dealer in San Francisco back in 2000. The acquisition of this movie was a huge blessing as I had read about it with drooling fan girl anticipation and when it arrived it was quickly unwrapped and viewed. The movie itself is not like the TV series and the two are only barely similiar in the basis of the characters having the same names and some of the same personality quircks. Utena has a different personality and Anthi is a promiscuous, incestuous, long haired flirt with an 'innocent school girl' attitude that is comical and risqay at the same time. Everyone has gotten a make-over of some kind, Miki's blue eyes have become green, Utena has lost her long hair and wears a French styled uniform, Anthi's bindi has become huge and so has her sexual appetite. Touga has become some kind of hero and is Utena's ex boyfriend. Perhaps a ghost. That part is never explained. This movie will make more sense if you are high. I don't promote the usage of drugs. But this is a true fact - this movie makes no sense if you base cause and effect on logic. There are strong lesbian tones to this movie, and I'm not talking about Juri either. There are some comical moments to be found and memorable in particular is the scene where Nanami is a cow, the beautiful dance scene where Utena and Anthi dance under the stars in rose water, the scene where Akio hops over two cars blurting ""Ciao!"" But all in all I was surprised to find this anime film seemed like a (purloining) made by Sega to promote some kind of video game of Utena that involved cars. If you want a 'complete Utena collection"". Then by all means purchase this video but otherwise just borrow it from a friend or rent it from an anime shop if you can. It isn't worth buying otherwise.  Buy the Graphic Novels To Till and To Plant that were recently released - those are much more worth your money IMHO!",1030147200,,1924,4.404494382022472
1623216,1,B00005LP42,"The Utena TV series was a masterpiece of interwoven symbolism, planning, and brilliant execution.  The movie, however, was not.  It left me with the feeling that the director wanted to encompass some of the greatness that was the television series...took a piece here and there...and then found all he could do was mash them together into an uninspired, convoluted mess.  I quote the director, from the audio commentary, that he included some scenes in order to 'surprise' the original writer of the TV series, and because he thought it would be 'cool' to include a few others, 'since they weren't in the series'.  The wonderful sense of depth that accompanied the TV series was turned into a horrific cacophany of ill-fitting pieces, dangling plotlines, and outright appalling misuse of characterization from a superb series.
I will, however, allow that it was very visually and aurally pretty.  Go ahead and watch, those of you who want more Utena, but know that this really has no connection, however much they claim there to be, to the work that has come before.  Laugh at the little 'in joke' scenes only those who've seen the whole series can enjoy, gasp in horror at others, and enjoy the spiffy fight scene animation.  I heartily recommend bringing painkillers to the viewing, however, if you're thinking about trying to make mental connections between the series, and...this.",1027814400,3,1384,5.0174672489082965
1623217,5,B00005LP42,"When I first saw this movie I was skeptical. First things first: the box is pink and the summary on the back is very short and simple. I had heard of the television series in Japan and it didn't seem like something I would ever watch. I even wondered if the fact that Utena and Anthy were lesbians was just a fan courtesy. However, after watching this movie a million times and falling in love with it a new way each time, I have put all doubt aside.
The film starts out by showing off its graceful, colorful animation and imagery. Then it introduces the main characters. As soon as Utena and Anthy meet, the fun begins. Until the movie ends, prepare your senses to be bombarded with catchy, fast-paced music, a distinct and emotional pattern of color and a myriad of complex and often thought-provoking symbolism. No story can duplicate the mental and emotional connections made by the story of Anthy, Utena, Juri, Miki, Touga and all the rest. The subplots are highly complicaated and draw out each character's connection to the real theme of the movie: rebelling against what holds you back, letting go of your ""necessary evils"", and breaking through to become a new and better person: adolescence. The unusual bond that Anthy and Utena share only strengthens this idea, for rather than be captive to the taboos and social laws of the modern world, they have decided to ""break through"" and become free.",1025913600,,1405,4.6923076923076925
1623218,4,B00005LP42,"You step through a wire framed gate and cast your eyes upon the 'impossible'.  Moving sidewalks, gothic architecture, and the faint smell of roses greet you, and upon entrance you are immiedately drawn into it's spell.
  Utena is not meant to be taken literally.  If you take everything said at it's face value, then this will be a shallow expierence for you.
  This movie is a cinematography masterpiece.  Angles make you think one way, only to have a turn of the camera and see its true appearence.  This is not odd, for in Utena, everything is not as it seems.
  Utena goes into Ohtori, and, after a brief encounter with her old lover Touga, finds herself dueling for the chance to be a 'prince' to Anthy, a 'Rose Bride'.
  From the instant Anthy and Utena meet, you can tell that fate had a part in bringing them together.  Their personalities supplement each other, with Anthy bringing out a little bit in Utena and visa versa.
  Utena herself is a teenager, and like teenagers, confused about life.  She is drawn in an internal struggle of past and present, duty and selfishness, right and wrong.  She becomes aware of things only to have another curveball hit her.  In Japan, this movie was title the 'Adolence of Utena' so these themes make perfect sense.  If only companies would keep the original titles, which are usually a key metaphor for the movie.  (Cowboy Bebop - Knocking on Heaven's Door has been shortened to Cowboy Bebop - the Movie as well)
  As Utena slowly comes to term with her reality, the movie takes a bizzare turn in which she becomes a car.  This may be wierd to some viewers, but again, the whole ending sequence is a metaphor for something big.  The script masterfully hints at this throughout the movie.
  Bad things do lessen this release and keep it from being perfect.  The Dub.  It's not that the voices are bad, it's just that they don't suit the characters.  Utena doesn't sound as innocent and naive as the Japanese version, and Anthy doesn't near reach that level of mysterious irony displayed in the Japanese Sub.  Watch the subtitled version to gain the full effect.
  Someone in another review mentioned that the last line ""Let's go to the outside world"" made no sense.  That person missed the entire essence of the movie.  Utena and Anthy are trapped in Ohtori, a surreal dream of the sort, by their own inner restraints and seeing things through 'rose tinted glasses'.  Only by letting go can they leave, and that in itself is another challenge.
  One last thing to mention is the supreme quality of animation and one scene in particular that sticks in my mind.  While Masami Okui croons out the poetic lyrics of 'Toki ni ai' Utena and Anthy dance upon water and a waterfall of roses, which in my opinion, is worth buying this DVD to see that scene alone.
  Hold up you hand, how many fingers do you see?  If you answered five, then Utena may not be for you.  If you said ten, then this movie is perfect.",1024963200,,2950,4.562141491395794

Like for instance, near the end of the movie they say, ""let's go to the outside world!"" when you didn't even know that they were on an Inside. Most of the movie was music and the plotline was very well written. Also there was a lot of nude scenes. Maybe it's cause I only got to read the first book so I don't understand it all 'cause we don't have the show in America, but I didn't like the movie very much so I sold it to someone on the second day after I watched it.",1023667200,,618,4.032520325203252

I believe it is a movie that is design to make you think, but it didn't seem to work with me, I felt LAIN, Ghost in the Shell, and Akira are better movies to make you think.

I might be a fairly conservative person, but I have enjoyed abstractions and scandelous actions in Neon Genesis, Coybow Bebop, Series Experiement Lain, and several other titles that are for adult viewers.  I really didn't like this movie.  Maybe it was too condensed (as some viewers say that its the tv series smushed down to eighty some minutes).  But the scandelous sections don't make up for that.

1623223,5,B00005LP42,"SPOILERS:
Why in the world did I just give the Utena movie five stars? Hell if I know, in all honesty. I'll be straightly blunt: it's a really, really, /really/ weird movie. (This is what is recommended when some really weird people come on rec.arts.anime.misc asking for yet /another/ acid trip after End of Evangelion.) Yet, even though it's weird, I find it very appealing.
I'll say that I haven't seen the Utena TV series. Well, four eps, but that doesn't really count. But a friend's friend who's seen all of Utena still can't get why characters just /happen/ to turn into cars. Hell, the thing that got me was that Touga was dead. That's a pretty heart-wrenching scene when Utena remembers this, too. *sniffs*
A big plus for the movie: the animation. Utterly gorgeous. Visually, the movie is just astounding. Anthy gets the most changed design other than Utena, and I like her movie design a lot better. (I don't like what they did to Utena's hair for the movie, though. >_<)
As I only viewed my friend's DVD, I can't give a good review of /all/ the features. The art sections with character sketches are nice, and the trivia quiz is good fun. ^_^
Well, if you liked EoE and are a very strange person and want /another/ movie that's weird like that, check out the Utena movie.",1017964800,,1282,4.578260869565217
1623224,5,B00005LP42,"Adolescent Apocoplypse of Utena (I believe that was the original Japense title; she's no longer a girl) is the fullfillment of that promise.  This movie shines in so many ways.  Oh, but wait, you probably don't know what promise I'm talking about because you haven't seen the whole Utena series.  The only real problem is with the boneheads who decided to release the Utena movie before the TV series.

  If you haven't seen the whole TV series you can't fully understand or appreciate the movie.  Of course, the movies so weird that it probably won't make sense the first time you see it anyway.  But that's what gives it so much rewatch value.  If at all possible get a hold of the fansubs and watch the whole TV series before seeing the movie, because it's a continuation of the story, the final chapter.  Of course, many won't be that patient so hopefully without spoiling anything here's a bit of background to put the movie in context.

  Things don't go so well for Utena at the end of the TV series.  The TV series was the story of an idealistic premodern girl growing up.  Utena revolutinzed the world for everyone who came into contact with her, yet she didn't completely grow up or revolutinze the world for herself.  The movie completes the story by showing Utena's revolution.  She's grown up into an adolsecnt now, stuck in that limbo between childhood and adulthood.  This is the story of Utena the adolescent growing up.  In it we can find an allegory about the growing up of postmodern man.

  Even if you don't want to dig into the deep (and I mean very deep) layers of symbolism and allegory the surface storytelling is still superb.  The visuals are absolutely gorgeous and the many musical pieces are incredible and really enhance the action and mood.

  Fans of the other characters may whine about their fave getting the short shrift.  But it's an 80 min movie, they've got to keep the plot focused.  So the only real characters are Utena and Anthy.  The movie does it's job perfectly of being faithful to the themes in the TV series and exploring the relationship of these two.  The others charcters are just props to assist the plot, as they should be in a movie where time is limited.

  The Utena movie is truly a masterpiece and a great end to a great series.  Hopefully software scultpor will hurry up and release the rest of this postmodern fairytale so more Westerners can appreciate it in it's entirety.  Parents may have reservations about showing this movie to kids as it does contain full nudity (except the girls just don't have ertain.. um.. stuff), incest, murder, suicide, and lesbianism.  Fans of Akio will also be livid over the fop who plays the role in this movie.",1017100800,2,2707,4.625263157894737
1623225,5,B00005LP42,"Every frame of this film is art.  From the beatiful backdrops to the phantasmagoric imagery, every scene is jaw-dropping.  The story is fantastic as well.  I cannot reccomend this film enough.",1016064000,,192,5.129032258064516
1623226,4,B00005LP42,"I don't know what I was expecting when I picked up this DVD.  By the cover, it appeared to be a shoujo anime (pink, very pink). The first time I watched it, I was left disturbed, with a vague ""Huh?"" feeling similarly produced by the finales of Lain and Evangelion.  The second time around it was more understandable, but was still unsettling.
The movie, Adolescence of Utena, is visually stunning.  Rose symbolism coats everything.  Many characters are beautiful, and the architecture of the highschool is elegant and creative.  Anthy's field of roses high above the school makes a good example.
As for themes, this movie is full of most any controversial one you can imagine.  Instances of lesbianism, murder, incest, child molestation, and suicide might make this movie inappropriate for children's viewing.
Not having seen the television series or manga of Utena, I don't know whether or not to recommend this movie to fans of those.  As a standalone production, I would only recommend it to a mature, open-minded audience.
On a final note, I wouldn't suggest getting too attached to the characters, as half of them are dead even as the movie is going on. I had to watch it twice to fully figure this out.  Also, watch out for the ending.  Utena, Shiori, cars...???",1015718400,2,1268,4.833333333333333

My conclusion on those people was that they just don't understand the symbolism in every single scene, the wondrous artwork and storyline that made this movie so amazing. This movie will have you thinking long after the DVD shuts off. The characters are in an alternate universe so there isn't a need to have seen the series, but I will say that you may be a little lost if you aren't at all familiar with Utena. Many people complain about how dark it is, but the point is that is is in an alternate universe! Besides, it follows the manga in that the manga is pretty dark and not as lighthearted as the anime.

There is some slight nudity and I can't remember if they cuss but I really did not get this movie.

1623231,5,B00005LP42,"I can see why some people regard this film as advocating lesbianism or whatever, but when I watched it, I regarded Utena and Anthy not so much as two different people, but as two sides to one coin.  I saw them as one person, or as all of humanity, trying to reconcile conflicting feelings, desires, and dreams while dealing with the fearful unknown of adulthood.  And that's just MY interpretation.  Who knows how many perfectly valid opinions can be drawn from this complex movie?
The animation is beautiful, detailed, vivid, and fluid, and the characters are majestic and beautiful (except for Nanami--she certainly got strange treatment in this movie).  I was pleased by how good the dubs are, and Akio's voice actually made me laugh, it was so smug and aloof.  Shionji's kind of threw me off, however, but this may be my personal taste. I was surprised Shiori got as large a role as she did, but what is great is that you can listen to the director's commentaries and understand why things were presented as they were.  On the other hand, some of his comments really made me wonder just how seriously I should take the movie since it seemed so many things were incorporated arbitrarily or for amusement's sake.  The extras are really cool, and the menu layout is just superb, even better than Cowboy Bebop.  Lots of moving images, sounds, and elements of the film incorporated into the menu items.
Overall, the best thing about this movie, like End of Evangelion, is that you can interpret it as you choose.  You cannot fully understand it with just one viewing because foreshadowing in the beginning gets fulfilled by the end, and you feel the need to refresh your understanding of the film.  I hope viewers don't get offended by the film, and it certainly is not for children, but for anyone who dreamed of exploding into adulthood on the wheels of power and freedom, this movie is for you.",1010275200,,1896,4.683734939759036
1623232,5,B00005LP42,"The first time I saw Utena, I thought it was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen.  And that was only the tv series.  However, after having seen the Utena movie (""The Adolescence of Utena"") I can definitely say it's also one of the most beautiful and special things I've seen...  Here are some things you may want to know about this movie.
Artwork.  The artwork in this movie is stunning.  Some of the best I've seen.  Even before the opening credits, I was spellbound.  Utena mixes seamless digital animation with superb traditional artwork to great effect.  The character designs are somewhat altered from the tv series (Utena's hair is sometimes short, Anthy's is always long, etc.), but only for the better.  The scene in which Utena & Anthy dance in a field of roses under the stars is a perfect example of the movie's superior art (and all of the movie's other high points).
Imagery & motifs.  Wow.  Utena is stuffed with gorgeous images, far more so than the tv series.  Once again, roses abound, but in even greater quantity.  Some of the most beautiful scenes - Utena's reunion with Touga in the beginning of the movie & the dance scene I mentioned above - center on roses, as do all the duel scenes.  Water is also a motif, used in alternately disturbing and soothing ways throughout the film, building to the revealing final scene with Utena & Touga.  Imagery is used to relate to the audience just what a strange & surreal world the Utena movie is set in.
Themes & Symbolism.  Symbolism is key throughout the movie, and you'd be pretty lost if you didn't pay attention to it.  Shiori's wings, Akio's ""key"", Anthy's scar, the faceless girls, and pretty much everything in the climactic & closing scenes.  Utena is built on symbolism - for instance, the entire end of the movie makes no sense except in purely symbolic terms.  The themes of Utena, in my opinion, are those of growing up, choosing one's own fate, self-reliance, and laying one's past to rest.  And love, of course.
Characters.  The characters of Utena are some of the most interesting and beautiful in anime.  Although Utena is ultimately the story of Anthy & Utena, all of the character development in Utena is fascinating (especially Anthy's, in my opinion).  In such a short movie with such a complicated story to tell, there is of course not enough exploration of side characters for my taste, but Utena & Anthy at least get plenty of attention.
Warnings.  Not warnings, exactly, but two things you might want to consider.  First, although Utena is definitely worth the time & money, the story is many-layered and hard to understand, and you may not want like to watch movies that make you think for an hour and a half straight.  Second, there is some mild nudity, violence, homsexuality, & references to incest.  Personally, I think it just makes the story more interesting, but you may object personally.
That said, the Utena movie is an incredible experience and I highly recommend it.  This one is worth the money.",1010016000,6,2994,4.7057692307692305
1623233,5,B00005LP42,"First off, I would like to address the other reviews on this page. Yes, there is nudity, but this is not what I would call porn. The themes are mature, yes, but the nudity is more symbolic. Nudity symbolizes many things throughout the movie.
Second, a little warning. If you are buying this to understand the series in any way - don't. This has little to do with the series. I have only seen the first 8 subbed episodes and read various descriptions and summaries of the others. My friend and I watched this together. She's only seen the first 8 and hasn't read any summaries. She understood the movie as well as I did.
It is a beautiful movie. The art work and symbolism will blow your mind. The relationships are beautifully twisted and strained. Angst, romance, betrayal... This movie has it all.",1009843200,,799,4.555555555555555

I do love how they draw their characters in Utena, and the animation is very well done. Warning: this anime is not for children.",1009411200,,388,4.0519480519480515
1623235,5,B00005LP42,"In some ways this is a movie that doesn't want to be understood.  The story itself, when understood, is very captivating and intriguing.  However, simply following the action with your eyes, having some basic understanding of the events, is what creates the most powerful viewing.  The plot consists of twists and turns, a disjointing loss of continuity, and it's done this way purposely.  The world that these characters inhabit does not follow the rules of reality, and I doubt the characters themselves are completely sure of what's happening.  In fact, I'd assume that these characters follow the world the same way we follow the events of the movie;  they are faintly aware of what's going on, why things are happening, but aren't fully conscious during the process.
The plot, to simplify it, is composed of characters whom inhabit a paradise.  This is a world with no imperfections, a place where everything works as it should.  The only pain in this world is the pain of memories, and as you watch the movie you soon understand that all the angst swelling within these characters is always based on faint memories.  The ending, not to spoil anything, is exactly how it should be;  Anthy and Utena are faced with a choice... they can continue living in paradise, forever haunted by the painful memories of their pasts, or escape to a world that offers no safe havens except the freedom from the chains that bind them.
Like many other reviewers have said, this is not a movie for everyone.  It's confusing, uncomfortable and sometimes painful.  But at the same time, there is a pure beauty presented here.  The mesmerizing animation of the utopia of the academy alone is worth watching the film.  But at the same time, the sparkling pink and blue hues have a fake, superficial beauty to them.  When the real world is finally seen, the muddy browns and earth tones are incredibly refreshing to the eyes.
Keeping an open mind to this movie is key.  You have to let go of your pre-notions of reality and be absorbed into the world of Utena.",1009411200,3,2042,4.742209631728045
1623236,5,B00005LP42,"'Adolescence Mokushiroku,' released in English as 'Revolutionary Girl Utena- The Movie,' is the alternate-universe abstract retelling of the 'Shoujo Kakumei Utena' television series.  While the movie differs dramatically from the portion of the TV series released in the US (which halts suddenly after the first story arc), it remains faithful to the surreal, abstract rhythm of the full series.  Full of symbolism and strange plot twists, this movie has a broad appeal, extending beyond the regular anime audience to anyone with an appreciation for the beautiful and bizarre.  This is NOT Pokemon- while the heavy male/male homosexual undertones from the television series (absent from the U.S. release) are almost nonexistent, the lighter lesbian undertones are transformed into an out and out love story between Utena and Anthy.

Like many other reviewers, I recommend that you watch the series first as the movie is basically a re-telling of the story but with a new ""layout"" shall we say.  The characters are magnificently drawn and the story is held together by the traditional surrealist aspect of the series.  Now, I want to make sure you people realize one thing.  Utena is not soft porn and it is not about ""lesbians"" or whatever else (...) people have written in some reviews.  The movie is beyond any stereotypes like that.  A lot of fans from the series are too caught up in their notion that Utena and Anthy were just good friends in the series and have suddenly become lovers in the movie.  That is absolutely not true!  People, surrealism uses imagery and provokes the mind to think beyond what we are seeing and hearing.  It's not about Utena or Anthy.  It's about humanity in general.  It's about how we only feel comfortable when things are right or left, up or down and we really never stop and think, ""Hey!  Maybe I'll just be different for a change!  Maybe I'll stop being what the world has made me and instead become what I want to be"".  For those of you who think Utena is soft porn, you need to losen your tie a little and get yourselves on track.  There's a difference between mild nudity and sexual acts!  In conclusion, this is a great movie for anyone that is 13 years or older and who doesn't take offense to thought-provoking ideas.",1007942400,3,1507,4.465201465201465
1623239,5,B00005LP42,"Breathtaking animation and an... interesting plot make this a fabulous feature.  Especially noticible is the high quality of the music.  The dub is much improved over the first arc of the series relased here.  It is very reccomended that you watch the TV series in its entierty before veiwing this movie, or at least have a good understanding of it.",1007856000,,349,4.783333333333333
1623240,5,B00005LP42,"This is a story of four young women haunted by ghosts; a story of love, hate, incest, guilt and hope -- and revolution. An ugly, beautiful tale brilliantly told.
Two girls are duelling each other for love in the academy walkways; Saionji and Miki are caught in a trial they do not see or understand. The girl without a heart dancing with her prince amidst the stars high above Ohtori, while the arena turns into a waterfall raining roses on the academy; Anthy literally driving Utena to pieces while they desperately race for end of the world, with the way blocked by a ghost who wants Anthy to be living dead. The world is an illusion and the castle has wheels; they also threw in a wicked bit with the elephants and Chu-Chu. Sounds like an acid trip? I'd call it an experience.
This movie simply has to be seen to be believed. It is a masterpiece, but perhaps not for the younger viewers -- they might enjoy the Rose Collection better, where the symbolism is lighter and the story not so obvious. For the more mature viewers, this is a must have. Definitely one of the classics.",1007769600,,1080,4.459595959595959
1623241,5,B00005LP42,"I am thoroughly impressed with this DVD! I had seen the movie in fansubbed version long before the commercial release, and the quality is SO MUCH BETTER ON DVD! The colors are vivid and the translation is good, in my opinion. I also like the extras that came with the DVD as well, especially the fan contest winners section. Buy this DVD today, and don't just stop there...buy the soundtrack CD as well! They're worth it!",1007510400,,421,4.552631578947368
1623242,3,B00005LP42,"Excellent animation and art combine with a unique storyline and striking choreography to form a memorable experience.  The experience is made more memorable by the bizaare turns of the story, which condenses the plotline of a manga series effectively into 80 minutes by using lavish doses of symbolism.  My only warning is that viewers might want to be familiar with the Utena story before seeing this movie.  Essentially, the director has retold the story with a great deal of imagery and symbolism as a way of revisiting a well known set of characters and storyline, almost as a fond rememberance for existing fans.  This anime, therefore, will be enjoyed by those who know the story and most by those who are rabid Utena fans.  In Japan, Utena is an absolute craze, breaking so many boundaries in a world of manga already known for challenging traditional social mores.  This movie targets those people who have already joined the legions of devout fans and who want more, more, more... .  STill, regardless of whether or not you are an Utena fan, this one is so unique and so well produced that, even with some imagery and symbolism that may be difficult to grasp... this is enjoyable and, more than anything else, memorable anime.  I may not watch it again very soon, but will certainly watch it again, and, in between these times, I will continue to think of certain scenes from time to time and puzzle over their meaning and their absolutely striking strangeness!  Enjoy...",1007510400,3,1480,4.818181818181818
1623243,4,B00005LP42,"Surreal and visually stunning, the Utena movie is a treat for fans of the series or anime fans in general.
It should be noted that the film is not a continuation of the series' events. It is actually a quite satisfying retelling of Utena's story, with many inside jokes for series fans to enjoy along the way.
I wouldn't suggest this to younger anime fans, since the film's themes are rather mature. But if you're of age, this film would be a fine addition to any anime collection.",1006819200,,481,4.4772727272727275
1623244,5,B00005LP42,"This is one of the most stunning films I have seen in any genre in a long time. The animation is crisp and fresh, the themes are exciting and though provoking, and the imagery is unlike anything that has proceeded it. The filmmakers have create a world that can't be referenced or compared to any that have preceded it. The viewer is rewarded for watching this move repeatedly, be it finding another layer of the story or noticing something beautiful they had not seen previously.
This should be considered a mod sci-fi classic. Any fan of androgyny, williful pretension, or adventurous mind-blowing owes it to themselves to get this disc. I can't stress it enough.",1006646400,,665,4.791304347826087
1623245,5,B00005LP42,Well I Love The Utena Series Its Great. Well The Movie Is A Bit More Mature But It s The Best Anime Movie In the World You Really Dont Have To See The Rest Of The Series Beacuse The Movie Sort Of Takes On A Whole New Story Line Apart From The Dueling But It Would Help If You Saw The Student Council Part Of The Series Means Thats  The Only Part Brought Here At The Time,1006473600,,370,3.8051948051948052
1623246,5,B00005LP42,"I watched the Utena movie before I watched the tv series and I have to admit I do like the movie better (but then again I loved the series too). Also I am not much of a shoujo fan so I was really surprised when I watched the movie and loved it!
It's extremely symbolic and almost dream like,it's like all the characters are stuck in a dream world that they can't get out of.
The only one who holds the key to the outside world is Anthy the Rose Bride. That's all I'm going to say about it, I don't want to give everything away.
It's not a children's movie though. It does contain mostly adult themes of sexuality, abuse, death, etc. You get the picture. It's also a movie that you have to think about after watching it. The movie does make sense once you thnk about it.
Buy it!!!",1006300800,,779,4.131578947368421
1623247,5,B00005LP42,"First off, I must say this:: THIS MOVIE ONLY MAKES SENSE TO YOU IF YOU'VE WATCHED ALL 39 TV EPISODES BEFORE YOU WATCH THE MOVIE!!!
Like any David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick movie, it's a ""new wave"" way of storytelling.  A lot of parables, allegories, references, and visual imagery to help you understand what they are trying to say.
I can't stress that enough.  This movie is an OAV, which explains answers to questions that were left unexplained to the viewer in the TV series.  So by not finishing the TV series, you are short changing yourself.  It's like never finishing Charles Dickens ""A tale of two cities"" and be expected to understand a movie on it that only shows the highpoints of the storyline.
Unlike most Japanese anime where things are not explained, this is explained, only if you watch the entire 39 episodes and the movie.  This is NOT an anime movie to watch without thinking.
Utena is a series where one must spend time to dissect the story, the motives and actions of each character, and how they interact with each other.  The relationships are of utmost importance. Therefore, this is NOT MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT. But a show that is full of imagery, nouvelle vague film techniques, and  philosophy about how to live.
The TV series is about how one grows out of childhood fantasies into adulthood, and the movie expands on that by concentrating on the ""growing into adulthood"" transformation part.  And as such, one must always watch it with an understanding of your own childhood, all the joys and pains of growing up, sufferings and triumphs, attitudes and changes, all that is incorporated into this TV series and movie.
If you truly want to understand this movie, take the time to review the TV episodes that you didn't understand, and rewatch them and redissect until you have your answer.  Switch viewing between the TV series and the movie is recommended until you have the storyline down.
The more you watch, the more understanding you will get.  The more you see the various nuances that makes this anime, not just a simple straightforward story, but one that's also poetic and illustrous.  Like all great classics, as your life experiences increase, you will discover even more truths in this movie/series.
For those who don't know, there are fansubs (fans who subtitled the TV series) available out there that you can get.
I highly recommend this movie. In conjunction with the TV series.
May you have revelation and inspiration -- then the duel called ""revolution"" has begun in your life.",1006300800,2,2520,4.823665893271461
1623248,4,B00005LP42,"This was an excellent movie, but I'm not going to try to convince you of that, because whether or not you like it is essentially a matter of personal preference. However, the dub stank. I would not buy the video if I were you! Thankfully, the DVD includes a Japanese-language track, and the Japanese voice actors were first-rate. Some of the extras were less exciting than I had hoped they would be (for example, the ""Behind the Scenes Commentary with Kunihiko Ikuhara"" has about 3 statements from said director, and then a bunch of interviews with the American voice cast), but the trivia game was fun and the Japanese trailers are really cool. The Anime Zone DVD is a waste of time. It's essentially just extra space for Software Sculptors to advertise in. (and their trailers are not known to be the most entertaining in the industry...)
I would certainly recommend this DVD to any anime fan that isn't easily offended (for reasons I won't reiterate), and most especially to Utena fans. However, don't expect the extra commentary to explain the movie to you (and it is hard to understand at times).",1006128000,,1101,4.739583333333333
1623249,5,B00005LP42,"If shojo isn't really your cup of tea, I would suggest giving this movie a try. You might have to have some knowledge of the TV series or you won't know what the heck is going on.

First off, lets clear the air. Even though Utena looks like a great film with animation that can one-up Disney, it is not for kids. It contains violence, nudity and lesbian themes. And when I say nudity and lesbian themes, I don't mean little. I mean there is a lot of it. Just a little warning for all you cautious parents out there.
Utena is in a new student at a high school in a very imaginative structural city. There, she meets her ex-boyfriend. Utena soon notices the Rose Ring. After aquiring one, Utena ends up in a duel with somebody at a rose garden. She soon learns that the Rose Ring gives the chance for a prince to duel. If the prince wins, he recieves the Rose Bride, Anthy. Utena wins and now she is still wondering what the point of the Rose Bride is. Utena plans to se Anthy free, but Shiori will not stand for this. Shiori, Anthy's new lovers, wants to humiliate the Rose Bride for her own ideals. Soon, it turns into a desperate escape from the city for Utena and Anthy.
All the characters look great in this film as they did in the TV series. Chu Chu makes a small appearence in a mini-movie right in the middle of the film. One thing you should bear in mind is that most of the plot is symbolic. If you don't keep this is mind, you won't understand any of the story.
Now for the extras. US Manga has spoiled us this time. First we get Audio Commentary by the director. If you didn't understand any of the story, the audio commentary will help you a lot. Next up is a Behind the Scenes feature with the dub cast. It was cool to see the ADR director from the Harlock Saga again. Theres some nice sketch and art video galleries on here as well. Even better, theres a Fan Tribute featuring 10 pictures of art and costumes presented by the fans. Continuing on is the Trivia. These questions are basically Did-You-Notice-That questions that are pretty easy. Then there are some great Trailers and TV Spots from Japan and the US. A pretty large number of extras that was worth putting on the disc.
Overall, Utena is one fun ride that should please any mature audiance who can appreciate good art and good story. Highly recommended.",1006041600,,2419,4.353982300884955

1623251,2,B00005LP42,"Ok let me start by saying I have RGU Rose Collection 1 & 2,and I loved them so much. When I saw that RGU the movie was coming out I thought great now we get to see who gets to revolutionizes the world and truly wins the rose bride and gets their wishes,and if Utena gets to meet her prince,the one who gave her the rose ring years ago when her parents died. If you pay attention in RGU Rose Collection 2 you will see her prince trapped in a sphere of some sort by another guy. So I receive the movie I rip it open pop it in my dvd and sit back with excitement. Well my excitement was dashed within the first 5 mins of the movie. You can tell everyone seems older,enter Utena who does not even have her rose ring and does not even know of this ring whatsoever and knows of nothing of the rose bride and does not know who Jury,Miki or Anathy etc are. I will give it this visually its Stunning breathtaking even,but I think it should have picked up where Rose collection 2 stopped at,I think they could have done so much better. I think that the relationship they did between Anathy and Utena ruined the wonderful Friendship they shared together in the first two Rose collections. I truly hope they do another RGU dvd or another movie but I hope they stick closer to the the Original 2 rose collections. I ONLY GIVE IT 2 STARS BECAUSE OF ITS VISUALLY STUNNING SCENCES.OTHER THEN THAT AS FAR AS THE WHOLE STORY GOES I GIVE THAT 1 STAR.",1005868800,,1431,4.188405797101449
1623252,5,B00005LP42,There are alot of changes in the characters like Utena dressed as a boy ^_^ and Abthy. At first they don't recognize each other but at the end they know each other. They are little bit of Utena's relationship with Anthy who has a glitch of becoming her rose bride. The other characters also have a different setting more of an adult setting than in the series. Like I said they became adults. Akio is real pimp because he was a player back than but he is flamboyant and he has a new hair cut. I think this video rocks!!! There were trailers about this movie which is so goth and I am a huge fan of it!!! Well I think evryone should see this and bring revolution to the world. Also the animation of it is wonderful and very beautiful with romansque designs.,1005350400,,756,4.256944444444445
1623253,1,B00005LP42,"I don't know what all the other reviewers are thinking.  This movie was awful, there was no continuity within the movie itself and no plot.  The animation itself was incredible, but the story makes absolutely no sense.  My husband and I both hated it so much we are almost turned off the Utena series entirely.  We may still try a black rose collection when it comes out.  Take my advice do NOT get this DVD, I think I am going to sell my copy.  I wrote this review to warn people to stick to the rose collection and that is it.",1004313600,,528,4.178217821782178
1623254,5,B00005LP42,"I would definitely give 5 stars for this movie-the background imagery of the Ohtori Academy is absolutely AMAZING! (gosh...those moving blackboards and balconies!) It has a totally different plot to the TV series, which i would recommend watching BEFORE watching the Movie, as otherwise it is hard to grasp the ideas and concepts.
It is interesting the way the plot moves along so fast (presumably due tothe limited time of a movie) and the music is awesome. I particularly liked the new character designs of Utena and Anthy...Touga looked smashing, as did Juri... symbolisms of long flowing hair (eg. Anthy is not ""restricted"" like in the TV series)
The Movie is more suitable for a mature audience, as unlike the TV series, the f/f relationships are VERY obvious (the TV series is more subtle) which may send out the wrong signals.
Overall, it is something that should be watched by all anime and non-anime fans... for though it is not realistic, it shows most human emotions of jealously, love, despair.......",1004313600,,1012,4.958823529411765
1623255,1,B00005LP42,Where do I even begin?  I absolutely LOVED the series.  I couldn't get enough.  I was flipping through the newspaper and saw the movie advertised.  I was so excited.  I got the movie later that day.  I called my friend up who was also really excited by the series.  We put in the movie and watched.  What a disappointment it was!  The movie takes all the fun out of the original series.  It takes the humor and fun out of the series and replaces with soft porn.  I made something very pleasant and made it oh so painful.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  I wish I could get my money back.  The DVD might make a good coaster.  Peace out!,1004227200,,648,4.154471544715447
1623256,1,B00005LP42,"Not to mess it up for those that have not seen the REAL Utena but what is this? The movie is only like the series in body but not spirit.  The main stay of the REAL Utena is honor and chivery not confusion and lesbianism.  Anthy and Utena were not lovers they were friends.  BIG diff!  I spent (dollar amount)on the box set of Revolutionary Girl Utena and thought it was well worth it.  I bought the movie hoping it would tie up some lose ends for me, not turn me against my TV.  I should hope no one true to Utena and her ideals will waste there money like I did.  The series has better music, better jokes and a much better plot.  After watching the movie I wanted to take a sledg hammer to my VCR with the movie in it.  I give this movie a -6 on a scale of 1 to 5.  Amazon should send back every last copy and demand there money back.",1004054400,,837,3.9285714285714284
1623257,5,B00005LP42,"Stunning animation, great music, and a wonderful story. I can't wait until my DVD arrives in the mail. I had watched a fansub of Adolscence Mokushiroku and was astounded. Unlike other anime movies that are spinoffs of tv series, this one is does not dissapoint veteran Utena fans, as the movie's story is just as symbolic and philosophically complex as the one of the tv series and the animation is superb. For those people who have not yet been exposed to Utena, this is a great movie to start with, although I don't reccommend this movie to younger children or those people who are sensitive about yaoi/yuri (homosexual) relationships. If you fit into any of these categories, I suggest you watch the tv series instead as the Utena movie's plot is more for mature audiences and has a lot of yuri romance in it while the tv series does not. Lots of surreal images with great character designs and animation. Overall, one of the best anime movies ever produced imho.",1003795200,,966,4.688235294117647

I strongly sudgest watching the series before the movie or it will be difficult to understand some of the ""inside jokes."" To get a full understanding of the movie and to pick out all of the little details and hints about the plot I strongly sudgest watching it a few times. The first time you watch it you'll probably only understaned the very basic plot of the movie.  The next time you watch it you'll have a fuller understanding of the plot.

If you haven't seen the series, you may be lost, but even if you did, it can be very mind boggling with mystery, intrigue, and some taboo themes. Utena and Anthy have a closer relationship than in the TV series, and the director even comments on the things he wanted in this movie. There's a lot of extra stuff too, but the movie is the best. They did a pretty good job at the English dub too, and I'm picky about that. Crispin Freeman as Touga, grr..., did awesom, so did Rachel Lilis. You must see. You must see.

1623265,4,B00005LP42,"The Utena movies is in form, very like the series. Yet in plot, it is no where close. Utena is a new girl at Ohtori academy and on her first day, she meets a girl named Wakaba who shows her around the school, where they see two students fencing(Juri and Miki). Utena spots Touga and races to talk to him. He tells her he has now come to this school to be in the student council duels and shows her his signet ring. (Apparently he and Utena were boyfriend and girlfriend years ago). Utena has had her hair cut short. Very short. She leaves Touga and sees a white rose in the middle of red ones. It glows and gives her her one Signet ring.(She didn't get it from a prince earlier). I won't tell you much more about the plot, because I don't want to spoil it, but it is kind of confusing, especially the ""scandalous tape"" section with the shadow girls. The greatest part in the video is the Toki Ni Ai Wa song part where Utena and Anthy dance in the rose filled duelling arena under the stars. It is very cool looking. Things I found disturbing in the movie: The heavy themes of Yuri(lesbianism) and the nudity.(never full nudity, but close). The screwy plot and suggestions of incest and murder. The way Utena's costume changes and her pants grow short and hair grows long when she duels.(although that's just a personal peeve). The strange car scene at the end of the movie where Utena transforms into a race car for Anthy to drive. (Shiori becomes one too) and the final scene where Utena and Anthy kiss while naked. Yay. That was happy. It's a weird movie, but if you're up for it, then go get it! (By the way, I saw the subbed version.

The art is beautiful.  The artist has recreated some the the characters if not all.  Everyone has a new look that you would definately like, and the music is impressive as well.

But Utena is great and anyone will love it! But if you loved Anthy as the quiet ""I'll do whatever you tell me to do"" girl, be warned cuz she definatly isn't in this! She even... oh, i don't wanna wreck it... Get it and watch it. You'll love it! ~~Bunny~~",996537600,,992,3.965
1623270,5,B00005LP42,"I just couldn't see this movie enough times.  With beautiful music, animation, and storyline, this movie is an all around winner.  Though it may baffle those who haven't seen all (or most) of the 39 episode Shoujo Kakumei Utena series, it's still a joy to watch, and also answers a few questions leftover from the series.  With new character designs and a revised storyline to boot, there's no room for disappointment!  Though it's a tough task to squeeze such a large series into a feautre length film, BE-PAPAS did an extraorinary job in completing that task!  I suggest this movie to anyone, whether they be an Utena fan or not.",994636800,,631,4.7
1623271,5,B00005LP42,"This seems like it is going to be one of the biggest anime releases of the year.
First off, the Utena Movie is a trip into the mind like anime has never ventured before. Though it is not as completely involved or confusing as Lain, or as down-right depressing as Neon Genesis Evangelion; the Utena Movie takes characters of which we all can connect with in one way or another, and it plops them into the most surreal, almost abstract, setting and from there makes our minds go haywire. Beginning with the floating setting of the Ohtori campus to rings blooming out of roses, once this movie begins it won't slow down. In a sense, this movie is a Picasso painting mixed with fairy tale and mystery. It takes the basic plot of the Utena TV Series, but being a theatrical release, it brings the story to a whole other level. Allowing more by way of the relationship of Anshi and Utena (they even pop in a kiss here and there and have complete nudity as well) + allowing a bit darker story (since TV usually allows a pg-13 rating at best, theatre allows for anything) this is the Utena story your mommas don't want you to see. But if you can I would highly recommend it!
I see that this release will be a treat for all of us fans. Noticing all the extras (Character development, interviews, making of section, Fan Tribute, + DVD-Rom extras etc.) that are on the disc (grr, I submitted fan art for the fan tribute section, but it didn't win...), both Dubbed and Subtitled versions, and seeing that the lyrics will be in romanji (yay!), I know that I'll be buying the movie the day it is released (and throwing out my fansub copy ^_^)... The only thing that gets me is that they don't have an option to take it off of Widescreen, but ah well. I like seeing the movie in its full expanse ^_^
So, if you're in the mood for a movie that only *slightly* makes sense, with top-notch animation, with characters and a plot that'll blow your mind away this is THE movie for you! Hit that 'Add to Shopping Cart' button this instant and reserve a copy for yourself!",993513600,4,2049,4.380577427821522
1623272,5,B00005LP42,"This movie was amazing.  It has so much symbolizime that my freind, who has the vhs form, watched it once a day for a month and she still couldn't figure out what all the symbolizim meant.  It took a group of us who had seen the entire series and understood it 4 hours to figure it out and we still missed some things.  If you love symbolism this is the movie for you i've wanted to get this movie since I saw it at a convention last year.
This movie is not a summary of the tv series.  It is its own little series.  It helps to have seen the series when watching it, exspecially at the ""scandalous video"" part, but if you have a good imagination it'll still make sence.",993427200,,670,4.083969465648855
1623273,5,B00005LP42,"Yeah, I saw the fansub on video.  Excellent little film.  If David Lynch did anime, itd probably be like this.  Maybe not as twisted as the last episodes of the tv series, but still a treat for surrealists and lovers of dense incomprehensible metaphor. (Count me in).  Like I said, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, that sort of thing, but with murder, incest, rape, betrayal, obsession, posession, sacrifice, true love, swordfighting and architecture Frank Gehry would puzzle over.  But don't worry about family values, most of the adult themes are so densely obfuscated, it'll go right over kids' heads. Its all about friendship, love and loss, and growing up, essentially.
A great soap opera romance novel heavy melodrama and bizarre satire, with a cast of just too many princes and princesses, but this aint yer mom's fairy tale.
And if you watched the tv series, all the characters are still here, but rewritten to be parodies of themselves almost, so if you haven't seen the tv show, it will still be fun, but there'll be weird references at times that are quite funny if you have seen the tv version.
And I don't want to hear any gripes about the Wagnerian heavy metal soundtrack music.  Its really quite appropriate and grows on you.
Oh, make sure you watch a subtitled version. We all know dubbing is demeaning to the director and voice talents.",992908800,17,1346,4.780172413793103
7944343,5,B00005LP42,"Wonderful movie! Revolutionary Girl Utena is my all-time favorite anime, its a beautiful story with amazing aesthetics and fantastic soundtrack. The movie has all of these elements, plus a new take on the story. I personally see it as a reliving and a sequel. I like to think that before Anthy could truly escape Ohtori, she had to live through the academy again and save Utena, who had not fully been free of it yet. It explains the changes in behavior and story, plus them escaping together in the end. Its a great movie! Definitely recommend (if you aren't offended by confusing movies and have already seen the series, of course haha)",1511827200,,638,4.705357142857143
7944344,5,B00005LP42,"Call me dumb, or at least clumsy, but I can't find the disc of this movie at my house. I have searched for that bloody thing for ages to no avail. I only have the empty plastic box. :( I am fearing I must have lost the disc when I moved out 6 years ago.

Putting aside the bizarreness of the movie along with the excellent animation and music aside, I am mightily impressed with the way the company designed the menu of this dvd. They cleverly used the scene where Utena dances with Anthy into an elegant menu. This wasn't just some sloppy job to churn any popular anime to make bucks, the company hired people that wanted to make a gorgeous product with nice extras.

It just makes me feel even worse that I have been unable to find my missing dvd after all of these years.",1482019200,,774,4.1879194630872485

7944347,4,B00005LP42,"The feel of this movie was very different from the episodic series. The characters had completely new personalities sculpted for this movie alone, and the backstory was revealed in a very different fashion. I liked this movie a lot as a standalone creation, but I had to distance myself from the series to watch it. While the series focuses on character traits and symbolism, this film focuses instead on surreal and breathtaking scenery. All in all it was definitely worth a watch.",1417305600,,482,4.890243902439025

The movie was more confusing then I remember, but that's because you'd need to watch the series to understand.. even from only watching about five episodes of the series, so far, I understood where the whole cow thing was coming from where as I had no clue before. Still love the movie as much as I did when I first watched it on television. Now to watch the series so that I can truly appreciate the film. n.n",1323388800,,528,4.453608247422681

7944350,1,B00005LP42,"I watched this almost a decade ago in high school, and since then my friends and I still get a kick out of it. The movie is well animated, but the plot is so bizarre that it's a candidate for MST3K.

From the characters who appear for one sentence and then disappear, to the silhouette radio commentary girls, video of a cow getting peed on, incest, rape, opera music (""I feel the Middle Ages within me--Schola Abstract""), and the most imaginative use of a carwash I've ever seen, this movie is in a class of its own. (It is not a good class.)

Strangely enough the movie does have a very good english dub and a lot more extras than most anime DVDs--interviews with the director (a guy who gives Tommy Wiseau a run for his money, stating that it's a movie with a metaphor, but he doesn't want to explain it), the dub cast (who break out into laughter when talking about the film), and some fanart.

For the $5 or so this movie is available for I think it's a great way to spend a night with friends who are lovers of camp and B movies. Just don't do it sober, please!",1306627200,,1067,4.220588235294118
7944351,5,B00005LP42,"Despite the terrible translation done for the American release which detracts from the quality of a rental for an English speaking viewer, Adolescence of Utena (or ""Revolutionary Girl Utena Adolescence Apocalypse"") is a masterful survey of female sexuality and the restrictions on the gender roles offered by society to young men and women.

The series itself and the movie by extension is a study in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, the shadow girls the shadows of real, living beings beyond the warped confines of Ohtori Academy.  The beings within the cave have no desire to pass through the fire that burns at the mouth of the cave and experience the pain and the responsibility of life in the ""outside world.""  Both the movie and the television series trace the trajectory of a character achieving freedom from this cavern at the cost of leaving all they've known behind.

I can't recommend watching this movie without having previously seen the series and having a working knowledge of the characters and Utena's rich tapestry of symbolism, which incorporates the writing of not only Plato other writers and philosophers.  (Hermann Hesse being an obvious one.)

Over its 39 episodes and its movie the world of Utena paints a picture of adolescence as a hell of hormones and trials by purgative fire.  Adolesence of Utena crystallizes the 39 episode masterpiece of Revolutionary Girl Utena into an eighty minute surrealism-fueled story not of how adolescence is spent, but how it feels.",1268784000,,1488,5.048979591836734
7944352,3,B00005LP42,"Since the Utena anime TV series was such a phenomenon, there just had to be a movie of it too. Originally titled Adolescence Of Utena, this took the shojo-ai premise of the story to full blown yuri proportions. Unlike Cowboy Bebop, Naruto, DBZ, or Sailor Moon, this one is a total remake of the show instead of being a sequel/midquel/prequel. Similar to the Escaflowne movie, this film retells the original plot but in a ""parallel universe"" sort of way. BTW, I'd like to point out that not all remakes of an anime are parallel universe stories, like Tenchi Universe or El-Hazard: The Wanderers.

The movie sets out with the mysterious Utena Tenjou just arriving at the illustrious Ohtori Academy, the campus of which is designed like an M.C. Escher wetdream. She finds out that her ex-lover Touga is there, who is a member of the student council. Utena then recieves a signet ring from a glowing flower, which indicates that she is now one of the duelists for the hand of the Anthy, the Rose Bride and sister of the student chairman. Utena ""wins"" Anthy away from the lecherous Saionji in a match after releasing a soul-sword from Anthy's body. The two of them become increasingly close throughout the course of the movie, and way more intimate than they did in the TV series. Alot of hints involving the supporting characters come into play, but these are mostly only relevent if you've seen the original show. Utena is then challenged by the student duelist Juri, although she beats her after tapping into the spirit of Anthy's brother. It is suddenly revealed that the student chairman supposedly killed himself after thinking Anthy had died. Not only him but Touga has been dead since Utena was a child too. This leads to the conclusion that the world the academy lies in is an alternate one from the outside world. Utena decides to leave with Anthy, but is then turned into a car(sure, why not?)! The rest of the film deals with Anthy now driving the Autobot-Utena in a big Speed Racer-style chase where most the other students(dead or alive is unknown)take on the forms of black race cars and chase after them. Anthy is saved at the last second by the surviving members of the student council, but only to have to be attacked by Cinderlla's castle on wheels. Anthy escapes the clutches of her brother(who might be Satan!), and she and Utena drive off totally naked into a desolate wasteland.

Okay, lemme first state that the movie sports some really keen animation, although not always in scope with theatrical quality, but a definate improvement from the TV series. At least there wasn't that redundant bit of Utena walking up the stairs to the castle that they used in every freakin' episode! However, trying to grasp the whole concept of this story is harder than trying to figure out the entire Evangelion series while watching it backwards and dropping acid at the same time(don't ask me how I know that). There are so many overlaying themes going on that it would take at least multiple screenings to even come close to understanding them all and how they might possibly all fit together. Utena and Anthy's relationship is amped up to being something more out of a hentai dojinshi than a plot for an official movie. The idea of the world where everything is happening is in itself like the land of the dead is done fairly well, but the rest of the premise for this is really hard to wrap your head around. I'd suggest that watching the entire TV series is a must before looking up the movie, otherwise you'll be really lost.",1265068800,,3536,4.683279742765273
