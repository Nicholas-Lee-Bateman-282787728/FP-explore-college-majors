8057732,5,B00096S3KO,"I'm very picky with my anime - I won't just watch anything that exists because it's in the genre like some people will. This is a good one. Full of action, has a good plot, the art is decent, voice-acting is alright. It's violent, but I like it. Hehe :) good stuff.",1356480000,,265,4.115384615384615
