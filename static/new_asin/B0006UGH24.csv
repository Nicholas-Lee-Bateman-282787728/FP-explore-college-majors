8043417,1,B0006UGH24,"Hailed as the ""ultimate portrait of Yasser Arafat"" this pointless documentary begins with about 40 minutes of evidently unedited material showing Israeli leaders basically lying through their teeth and demonstrating their poor knowledge and incapacity to speak engagingly and knowledgeably to a pay audience. Stone's involvement in this project is incomprehensible. I could have done better with a cheap video camera. The paucity of in depth interviews and background information make this anything but an ultimate or even a fair portrait. As it is said, history is written by the victors. The depiction of 'Native Americans' in Hollywood movies suffers from a deep and seemingly intractable bias, and considering the depth of US involvement in the so-called 'Israeli-Palestinian' conflict, it seems presumptuous if not downright stupid to expect a Hollywood pet to make a politically correct, let alone engaging movie about the subject. If this is meant to inform audiences about Arafat or the Palestinians, I fear for the future. Stone ought to be thrown of a cliff or trampled by horses for attaching his name to this garbage.",1431561600,,1129,5.312849162011173
8043418,1,B0006UGH24,"It is almost impossible to convey in words how God-awful this documentary on the Middle East conflict is. It has become something of a commonplace in recent times to complain about the pomposity of the average Oliver Stone film, but never before has Stone been so pompous as to actually inject himself into a film as the protagonist. And if you have any doubts about the enforced centrality of Mr. Stone to the subject matter, you have merely to glance at the cover of the DVD: it looks as though the title of the movie is 'An Oliver Stone Film' because the actual title of the film has been placed in tiny print beside this tagline.

Stone's manner of filming his interviews is bizarre. One hand-held camera will glide slowly along behind Benjamin Netanyahu's shoulder while focusing on Stone, who is sitting opposite. Meanwhile a second cameraman simultaneously covers the reverse angle. The result looks like two cameramen trying to film each other while a former head of state is blocking the shot. (Doubtless this Brechtian gimmickry was Stone's idea of 'keeping it real'.)

Stone's demeanour throughout is also weird. At most of these encounters he seems hardly to have bothered asking a question, but merely sits around avoiding eye contact and trying to look pensive. In fact, he just comes across as looking heeedless. Meanwhile Ehud Barak, Shimon Peres and Netanyahu (to whom all manner of awkward questions could be put) get to drone on and on unchallenged ...

Gimmicks abound. Subtitles saying 'Qalandia Checkpoint: Israel - West Bank border' are rapidly typed onto the screen with bursts of machine-gun fire added to the soundtrack for effect. This is supplemented by MTV-style quick-cut editing, discoloration effects, all manner of fly-on-the-wall randomness ...

Compare and contrast. Around about the same time as this movie came out, veteran Australian journalist John Pilger released a DVD entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Middle-Ground-in-the-Middle-East/dp/B000O76V66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Middle Ground in the Middle East</a>&nbsp;which comprises three one-hour documentaries including the excellent 'Palestine is still the Issue'. His presentation is clear and unstylized; his questions are probing and to the point; and (although he plainly has strong opinions on the issues he covers) he is always fair enough to allow the other side to get their view across. So why would anyone waste their money on 67 minutes of Oliver Stone when they can get three hours of a real journalist actually performing the duties of a journalist?

Want specifics? Pilger's documentary spends some time discussing the case of the first female Palestinian suicide bomber: her life, her possible motives, and the victims she claimed. This same bomber also features in Stone's film: he points to poster of her on the wall, says 'Look at that: she's cute', and moves off. Topic closed.

The Arab/Israeli Conflict is an important issue. But what comes across in this documentary is that it should not be allowed to dwarf the importance of Oliver Stone. The focus of the film appears to be largely on the fact that Stone took the trouble to turn up in Israel/Palestine: its exploration of the conflict is lazy at best. Stone seems to have been so gratified merely by the fact of being there that it never occurs to him to ask an awkward question that might spoil the trip. The result is not so much a tour of the region as a one-hour ramble around the inside of a thoroughly incurious mind.",1244592000,2,3551,5.177700348432055
