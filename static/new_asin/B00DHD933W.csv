5800512,5,B00DHD933W,Four of the best Morgan Freeman movies out there! Really a great edition to anyone's movie collection! Best part was I didn't own any of these and wouldn't have thought to buy each one separately since they are older movies. Definitely glad I got this. I had forgotten how good these movies were.,1392681600,6,296,4.60377358490566
5800513,4,B00DHD933W,"Morgan Freeman has earned his superstar status with his trademark believability and effortless integrity in a career spanning some 40 years now and with this four film favorites edition, we can easily see why. This is a good roster of films that showcase much of the actor's strengths as a performer whether he's the cynical, weathered Cop in the seminal ""Seven"", or the optimistic profiler/hero from James Patterson's Alex Cross series in both ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came A Spider"". Of course it's rounded out by one of the most revered motion pictures from the 90's ""The Shawshank Redemption"", quite possibly the Mount Rushmore of Prison escape flicks where he shines as Red, the ""guy who can get things"" to the inmates of Shawshank penitentiary. This collection does feature stacking, which has understandably rattled a few consumers, meaning it's all four discs squeezed on to a slightly enlarged spindle. Also it must be said that despite the back cover proclaiming to feature Frank Darabount's commentary to ""Shawshank"" (Which is on the double feature dvd and I suspect its' blu ray edition), is not featured on this set. It is just the original bare bones disc with the film, trailer and liner notes only. Still, if you like the films and the performer, it's a cool way to feature all four pictures. His watchability factor measures quite highly in the 2 flawed Alex Cross films. Kiss the Girls rates slightly higher than the convoluted Spider but Freeman's charisma almost singlehandedly carries the film. You like him as this character. Unfortunately, despite good box office and ideal casting, it appears they can't bring him back as Cross (Tyler Perry of all people took up the role in Alex Cross and allegedly Idris Elba will proceed him soon in Double Cross). Regardless, all in all a nice collector's set of mostly thrillers and then one Prison drama that became an Oscar contender for 94. All widescreen.",1382832000,15,1924,4.941358024691358

5800546,5,B00DHD933W,"Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors, so when I saw this 4-film set, I just had to get it. These are such good thrillers too, especially my favorite James Patterson adaptations and Morgan Freeman is so good as Alex Cross!

I've watched three of the DVDs so far (Seven, Kiss the Girl, and Along Came a Spider), and they are all in widescreen, with English, French and/or Spanish subtitles. Not much in terms of special features though.",1460505600,,287,4.76
5800553,3,B00DHD933W,"I really, really love Shawshank. Yes, we have all seen it a million times. But, it is such a great movie! Bought this as a gift for former co-workers that retired after 40+ years with the company. Really reminded me of ""Andy's"" escape. The other Morgan Freeman movies are pretty good. That's the only reason I gave the entire disc only 3 stars. If it were Shawshank purchase only I'd easily rate it as 5 stars. The cost of 4 movies was similar to the cost of Shawshank alone. And, now that my friends are retired they have the time to watch 4 movies!",1459209600,,550,4.298076923076923

5800575,5,B00DHD933W,"All these movies are excellent, but I am a Morgan Freeman fan, so I could be biased. The thing that they have in common is they all have very interesting and in some cases convoluted plot lines. The endings of all of them are totally different than you expect.

5800606,5,B00DHD933W,"Morgan Freeman is of the greatest actors, who often gets the odd roles that only he can pull off making for great movies. He never lets you down when he has top roles either. Here are four of my favorites which I feel would still be on the cutting room floor if not for Freeman. He does narrating and cartoon voices as well. It saddens me that he gets so little recognition from Hollywood when there are so many of us that when we see his name anywhere in the listings just have to see the show and pay good money for it.",1414108800,3,521,4.067961165048544

5800609,5,B00DHD933W,"There is not one wrong word that I could ever say about Morgan Freeman. The first movie of his that I ever saw, was the wonderful  "" Driving  Miss Daisy"". Since the first time, I have watched it four times. I have yet to see a movie of his that I wasn't happy with. All four movies on this four movie set are certainly among his best, if not his VERY best so far. He seems to be able to top each performance with a better one.
Take my word for it, if you want a really good deal for your money and to see four really good movies, you cannot possibly go wrong in buying this. Go on, be a devil, make yourself happy and buy iy. You will be glad you did.",1406419200,8,651,3.8507462686567164
