The name itself elicits thoughts about blood and there is blood. The first scene is drenched in the red matter and throughout the movie and regular intervals. Rakhta Charitra is a biographical piece on Paritala Ravindra of the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, his rise to power.
Political rivalries between politicians cause the death of a close confidant of a local politician in Anandapur. Unknown to the politicians, the victim's son sets out on a revenge mission. This son is Paritala Ravindra . I thought the movie was well directed and edited. Ram Gopal Verma returns to form and shows that he is capable of delivering quality films; this may not be his best effort but has shades of some of the brilliance that we saw in Satya and Company. Vivek Oberoi shows the acting promises that he showed us in his debut Company. I thought the movie was sensational even more chilling because of the true incidents that inspired this film. 4 stars. 5/1/2011",1304726400,,973,4.791666666666667
