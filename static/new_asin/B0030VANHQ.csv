4047288,3,B0030VANHQ,some clips were high quality but most were poorly transferred to dvd + Blu-ray - sorry but that's the truth,1358035200,,107,4.4
4047289,4,B0030VANHQ,"What a surprise this was! I expected a few 'thrown together' clips but this was a well researched, professionally edited compilation or 'highlight reel'. All clips are from the best sources, with some surprisingly excellent prints and arranged in chronological order from 1970 to 1979, each clip proceeded by on-screen info on the starlet. This volume concentrates on cult, european or exploitation stars so is more geared towards cult movie buffs, film fans and collectors. Running at just under five hours, with no 'padding', plus extra compilation, this is great value.",1321488000,5,572,5.2967032967032965
4047290,3,B0030VANHQ,"I'll admit, this was fun to watch.  I haven't seen Volume One yet, so I started watching this Volume Two of The Saucy Seventies, which has alot of unknown, but no less beautiful foreign and American actresses.  This collection seems to have alot of Italian and other European soft porn stars of the era.  There are a few familiar names that I'm happy to have a short clip of.  Even amongst all these unknown foreign actresses, you still get a clip from Catherine Bach, Priscilla Barnes, Susan Dey, Nastassja Kinski, and even Lindsey Wagner.  About a hundred women or so. Beautiful women, one and all.

It's amazing how many ways a piece of film stock could look so bad.  There is a lot of high quality film snippets here, but there are many that look really bad, and having them play intermittently with the better clips only brings attention to how bad some of these film snippets look.

Now this DVD runs for about four hours and 55 minutes.  I would have rather seen them make a decent four hour collection of all the better film footage, and then maybe make a ""special features"" added bonus of all the lower quality film footage to run together as its own chapter, starting from the worst film footage, improving as they go.  If all the bad quality stuff played together, it wouldn't be so easily recognized at how bad some of this film footage looks.

I hope they consider that when they make more DVD's of the ""Celebrity Nude Revue.""

I tried entering their advertised website, but it doesn't seem to take me to their other DVD's.",1317513600,13,1536,4.545454545454546
4047291,2,B0030VANHQ,"I was hopping this would be a continuation of Saucy 70's volume 1 - it's not. Where Vol. 1 was a sneaky peek of many of the stars I fantasied about in my youth, Vol. 2 was just a bunch of naked European (mostly) women I didn't know.",1309564800,2,232,3.8541666666666665
4047292,4,B0030VANHQ,"I don't know what DVD Thumper saw, but the quality of each scene on the DVD I received was very good.  There were some pleasant surprise in the Extra Scene category. If you like seeing your favorite stars nude this is the video for you.",1294185600,10,236,4.2444444444444445
4047293,4,B0030VANHQ,The title tells you almost everyting you need to know about this disc. The one thing I would add is that they start off each segment with a little bio about the actress that is appearing. I found the bio a very interesting addtion and much of the information supplied gave me knowledge of the individual I enjoyed.,1282348800,8,314,4.431034482758621
4047294,5,B0030VANHQ,"This sequel is definitely better that vol 1, and vol 1 was really good.  The bonus ""quick peaks"" makes the running time almost five hours.",1273536000,17,138,4.52
