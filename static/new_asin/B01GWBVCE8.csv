8763981,1,B01GWBVCE8,"Handsome, divorced lawyer, Marcus pursues 32-year-old Courtney, who is crippled and on crutches. Shes insecure, but hes older and persistent. They have an affair and move in together, but can their romance succeed? It's hard to find anything positive to write about this movie. The plot is not well-developed or interesting. There are awkward pauses throughout the film, and the acting is abominable. Simply a very bad movie.",1503792000,,425,5.264705882352941
