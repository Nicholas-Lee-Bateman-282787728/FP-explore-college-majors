They broadcast shows from ""Are You Being Served?"" to ""The Last Of The Summer Wine"" to ""My Hero"" and ""Red Dwarf.""  I remember that I almost pee-ed my pants watching ""My Hero"" from laughing so hard.  This is an AMAZING show that i cannot wait to be able to view when ever i want.  As soon as i saw this up for sale I pre-ordered it.  I hardly ever pre-order anything, that is how you know that this series is a good one and well worth your time!!!",1164844800,6,615,4.041322314049586

Ardal O'Hanlan is perfect as Thermoman (and just as clueless as in Father Ted), and for sheer 'feel-good' TV watching, this can't be beat.

Worth watching; worth buying!",1151193600,17,436,4.697368421052632
2519956,5,B000EHQU12,"My local PBS station shows this program (eight months a year, they don't show any of their normal programming during pledge months).  I admit that I enjoy some of the other programs fairly well (""As Time Goes By,"" ""Keeping up Appearances"") but this one is a scream.

There is still some 'settling in' of the actors into their characters' quirks and focus but this show hit the ground running.  Far more interested in American Culture than older Brit-Coms, they actually make fun of President George W. Bush.  But ""Friends"" this is not.

It's a show that is about character.  Particularly one George Sunday: Enthusiastic superhero, health food store proprietor (he opened the shop because it was a perfect cover for his superhero work as nobody ever much visits), and all around silly-person.  His loving girlfriend/wife Janet is smart, sexy and rock solid.  She's the perfect foil for George's flights of in-human behavior.

Her parents, Ella and Stanley, hate George from the word go and are amazingly funny folks who Janet can barely stomach.  Next door neighbor Tyler looks like a human pincushion and talks like the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's were VERY good to him.  He just happens to instantly recognize George as Thermoman.  I admit to having a soft spot for Tyler.  He tries so hard, and could have been a one-note character, but he is endearing as well.

George's cousin Arne (another space alien who was stricken from the ranks of superheroes for charging folks for their rescues) and Dr. Piers Crispin (Janet's boss and her mother's idea of a 'catch' for her confounding daughter) are as close as the series get to bad guys.

But they're wimps compared with resident Bad Girl -- Mrs. Raven (the incomparable Geraldine McNulty).  She's a mass of Mother Hate, bile, lying, scheming, and genuinely frightening at times; McNulty somehow plays her as an underdog.  And G*d help me, I find myself rooting for her at times.

So far, only the first three or four seasons have played here in the States.  And while I would miss O'Hanlon as George, I freakin' LOVE James Dreyfus and can only imagine how stellar the show would be with him on it.

This series does everything wrong.  The romantic leads marry and have multiple children (a HUGE no-no on American sitcoms with their decade-long flirtations and babies only in the final season ideology).  The show takes on current events (when most Brit-coms could literally be from any time at all).  But despite these lapses, it is laugh out loud funny.

The moment in season two when Mr. Raven causes a completely naked man to walk out, and back in (under her watchful eye) to the clinic was so funny I nearly passed out laughing.  And George's inappropriate kissing of virtually every other character on the show had me in stitches.

Buy the show.  Enjoy it!  You'll be laughing for years.",1145318400,42,2840,4.788065843621399

2519978,5,B000EHQU12,"if you love UK comedies, you will love this one.  if you find most of them barely comprehensible, much less funny, you might hate this. quite simply, the Brits have a unique sense of humor which takes some gettting used to but once used to it, you come to love it.  i remember the first time i saw Absolutely Fabulous and thought it was an absolutely dreadful..  a few years later, trying it again, i was laughing myself silly.  so if i weren't used to these comedies by now, i'm sure i would have thought this comedy was quite dreadful too.

what they do is turn the whole superman comics idea on its head. thermal man has all the same powers as superman but in his private life he is a bit of a dork named george.  one day he rescues nurse janet from falling into the grand canyon, he falls in love with her on the spot and moves himself to her village and sets himself us as a health food store proprietor.  his wares are so ultra healthy that he has virtually no customers,  this is good because his real job is saving people. his secret identity gets more hilarious from there.  he says he is irish but he doesn't drink and comes from a part of ireland where the pub in his village is non alcoholic.

he meets janet in her clinic and they do fall for one another and move in with one another.  but the fun is only beginning as we now meet the potential in laws from both sides of the family, all of whom of course want to break them up as does janet's employer doctor, a good looking, conceited prima donna, who wants to get her away from our caped hero.  there is a crazed neighbor next door, a hialrious office manager in janet's clinic with an acidic view of life and george's cousin in new york, now running a diner there since he was fired from george's job by the planetary elders when they caught him charging people.  george turns to this character for advice whenever he has problems with janet or the in laws.

if you are having a bad day, week, month or year, tune in to this show.  it will transport you to a much funnier world at once.

2519979,5,B000EHQU12,"Ardal O'Hanlon is in classic form in My Hero. I can only describe his style as ""Father Dougal McGuire Meets Superman"" in that he has many of the same traits as his classic role in the hilarious ""Father Ted"" series - a gormless but lovable simpleton.

In this series, he is somewhat brighter than his classic role as Dougal, but due to his unfamiliarity with Earth customs (due to being a REAL alien!) and an apparently native ""Ultronian"" tendency towards telling the unvarnished truth at all times, or (in the case of having misunderstood instructions from his cousin Arnie or someone) getting the wrong end of the stick, he is screamingly funny in his miscues, inadvertently insulting or discomfiting all and sundry -- including his long-suffering girl-friend, her mother, and co-workers.

There are interesting and zany elements of other ""space alien"" comedies, including the ""Mork and Mindy"" series, but Ardal and his colleagues bring their own brand of charm to the mix.

I unreservedly recommend this to all lovers of British (and Irish!) comedy. Ardal is brilliant!",1311897600,,1071,5.03954802259887

2519981,5,B000EHQU12,"This British series has a rather outlandish premise, but it is so very funny. Vaguely reminded me of Mork and Mindy, but much much better.

The main character is an alien superhero called Thermoman. His cover on Earth is as George Sunday, the owner of a health food store. When Thermoman senses a crisis, he goes there to fix things, be it earthquake, volcano, flood, etc etc. At the start of the series, he saves a nurse named Janet who has fallen into the Grand Canyon.

Janet and George meet up soon after and fall in love. George interprets English in a very, very literal fashion which leads to some very hilarious results. He also does not understand Earth customs very well and similar hilarity results. He does it all deadpan with a great Irish accent.

There are several other regular characters like Janet's parents and a crazy neighbor of Janet's named Tyler - and I do mean crazy as in he thinks he visits Neptune quite often. There is the woman who works in the health food store who has a nasty cold all the time - kind of out of place where she works. There is also the doctor that Janet works for who is really full of himself.

The receptionist at the doctor's office is just wicked - but really funny at the same time. Those triplets of hers are always up to something too, but they never actually appear.

George has a friend from his planet living in New York that runs a greasy spoon type diner. George visits there quite often - he can fly across the Atlantic in a few seconds. His friend has to explain Earth customs to George, but this is not always successful which leads to more funny results.

Some of the time, things are a bit silly, but most of the time they are truly hilarious. Give this one a try and enjoy!",1299196800,,1740,4.371517027863777

Thermoman is doing just another rescue when he falls in love with nurse Janet Dawkins. He goes to visit her in Northolt as George Sunday, the Irish shopkeeper. The couple date and George pops over to New York to ask his cousin for advice on love...
In the later episodes, the other characters meet George as he is now living with Janet. These characters are as follows:
-Tyler, Janet's crazy neighbour. The first thing he says to George is ""Hi, Thermoman!"" George tries to convince him he is not Thermoman, and eventually tries to erase Tyler's memory. It doesn't work.
-Janet's parents, Ella and Stanley. Ella is bossy and never content. No wonder Stanley always dreams of killing her!
-Piers Crispin, Janet's employer. He thinks he is the best thing since the beginning of the earth just because he's a TV doctor. He isn't good at his job and his employees are always critizing him.
-Mrs Raven, the receptionist at Janet's work. She is cunning, mean, dark, pessimistic, insulting, angry, resentful...the list goes on. She likes to destroy Piers' life.

Straight out of BBC and via certain PBS channels comes MY HERO, an affable, off-the-wall comedy series about that strange visitor from that distant planet, Thermoman (Ardal O'Hanlon). He hails from the planet Ultron and has only recently arrived on Earth. He's not built like a regular guy: he has six toes on each foot for added balance, double jointed knee-caps for extra maneuverability, and a larger than normal navel, of unknown purpose but of which lint content could be used to stuff a duvet. Able to literally sniff out trouble and utilizing restrooms as his means of egress, Thermoman plies his superhero trade on a daily basis and has become one of the busiest caped crusaders around as he rapidly flies around the globe staving off catastrophe after catastrophe. Consequently, he doesn't really have much time for romance. So imagine his surprise when he falls in love with the lovely Janet Dawkins (Emily Joyce), a vacationing 29-year-old British lass he rescues from a fall in the Grand Canyon.

The smitten superhero follows her to Northolt, England, where she works as a nurse in the Northolt Health Centre. He introduces himself to her in his civilian guise of George Sunday, owner of a modest, often unpatronized health store. What then  follows is his fish-out-of-water wooing of the down-to-earth Janet, who actually prefers to be with a regular bloke but is, nevertheless, charmed, if non-plussed, by the eccentric Mr. Sunday. The rest of the very brief first season goes on to unveil the various pitfalls and domestic annoyances of a working girl in love with a clueless superhero from the stars.

No, MY HERO is definitely not one of those cerebral comedy shows. It doesn't have multiple intricate plotlines going on per episode. Instead, what this show has going for it is an engaging comic quirkiness and just plain old silliness, most of which is embodied in our main character George, aka Thermoman, who elicits giggles and smiles from the viewer as he insists on verbalizing his blunt and  mindnumbingly obtuse takes on Earthlings and their alien ways. Mind you, it's not that he's stupid as much as he's still fairly new and hasn't yet adapted to the every day nuances of our society.

The very literal-minded Thermoman and his alter ego George Sunday is played with straight-faced, dry-witted panache by Irishman Ardal O'Hanlon while his love interest, the much put upon Janet Dawkins as portrayed by the appealing Emily Joyce, provides common sense and the sorely needed grounding for this daft series. Matter of fact, Janet may be the most normal of her lot as she often finds herself besieged by her meddling mum, her amicably unhinged neighbor Tyler, her self-worshipping boss, and a very unnervingly sarcastic receptionist (who resents her triplet offsprings). On Thermoman's side, there are his ever sniffling, socially inept employee Avril and his cousin Arnie, himself once a superhero until he got fired for charging rescue fees, who now resides in New York and dispenses wisdom to our clueless hero.

This being a television series, the budget isn't set at a lofty level; thus, the f/x is a bit slapdash (there aren't any supervillains here, for example,and all the rescue missions are done off-screen). But, never mind. You could put a ""glass is half full"" spin on it by stating that the shoddy effects actually add to the fun and silly, unassuming ambiance of the show. Ardal O'Hanlon actually looks pretty decent in his red and gold superhero costume and his visored helmet, even a bit dashing and all that. Meanwhile, Emily Joyce doesn't need a super suit to look good. Other than the two very capable leads, this show is vastly served by the inspired performances of Geraldine McNulty in all her bitter glory and Hugh Dennis, who plays his character with dizzying self-absorption. The rest of the cast is okay.

What sucks is that MY HERO, the first season, is comprised of only six half-hour episodes. It  would've been nice to have seen more of George and Janet's domestic misadventures as they strived to maintain a sense of normalcy in a very weird relationship. From Janet's point of view, it's a little off-putting to have a boyfriend who can supersuck crumbs and laundry suds off the floor. She's even given a superhero manual to read so as to not cramp the fella's style. They can't have sex more than once a month lest she sap too much energy from him, to the detriment of humanity. Plus, everyone thinks he's really odd. And from George's point of view: he's going out with an Earthling woman, who is definitely inferior to him species-wise, something which his biased father vehemently points out. He also has to deal with kooky neighbor Tyler, who, probably thru ingesting enough herbal stuff, instantly pinpoints his true identity. Plus, he still has to save the world every now and then. So who's ahead in this relationship?

The best part of this series, obviously, is when George (not Thermoman) is on the screen, bluntly speaking his mind and committing howlingly funny faux pas after faux pas. The second tier of hilarity comes from Mrs. Raven's scathing comments and Dr. Crispin's shameless self-love and eternal quest for the spotlight (his polished battle cry is ""I am always here"" as he rushes off to do his morning telly show). Emily Joyce, too, has her witty bits. Anyway, the stories are simply structured and generally follows the tried and true comedic plot patterns. What makes 'em brilliant are the throw away, eccentric bits that pop out of the dialogue every now and then, mostly from George's lips. And, if you enjoy Ardal O'Hanlon as George, then check him out in FATHER TED where he plays the simple-minded but very funny Father Dougal Mcguire.

The rather shabby Bonus Features include ""Against All Odds"" (5-minute on-the-set interviews with Ardal O'Hanlon and Geraldine McNulty during the filming of a stunt), ""Funny Blokes: Interview with Ardal O'Hanlon,"" and cast bios.

**************************************************************************

""My Hero"" (episode one) - While rescuing nurse Janet Dawkins from a lethal plunge into the Grand Canyon, Thermoman finds himself falling for the winsome damsel. In his civilian guise of George Sunday, Irish health store owner, he pursues her to England where Janet works in a clinic with dourly sarcastic receptionist Mrs. Raven (Geraldine McNulty) and the self-involved Dr. Piers Crispin (Hugh Dennis).

""Guess Who's Coming to Lunch?"" (episode two) - This is a hilarious episode! George and Janet grow ever more anxious about George meeting her parents for the first time and over lunch. George, upon Janet's insistence, strives to be ""normal,"" but, really, it's easier said than done...

""Mission Impossible"" (episode three) - A Russian space station careens out of control and veers towards Earth, but Janet won't allow Thermoman to go and save the world until she's cleaned his costume of a toast jam stain.

""Thermoman's Greatest Challenge"" (episode four) - George has recurring nightmares of Janet being killed and pretends to go to the bathroom 17 times.

""Old Man Riverdance"" (episode five) - George's peculiar dad, the original Thermoman, comes a-visitin' and he doesn't think much of his son cavorting with an Earth woman.

""The Party's Over"" (episode six) - Janet hits the big 3-0 and she's not bothered a bit about it.",1169596800,8,7377,5.027846027846028
2520009,5,B000EHQU12,"Oddly enough my entire family fell in love with this show before having seen Father Ted. Despite the hype following Father Ted, everyone in my family loves Ardal O'Hanlon best as George Sunday/Thermoman.

The character formula is virtually the same, George being as naive as Father Dougal, only having fantastic super-powers. What makes him more interesting than Dougal are the relationships he has to navigate and lessons on human behavior he must learn from a fantastic assortment of characters such as; the incredibly bitter mother of triplet's Mrs. Raven, the completely ego-centric Dr. Crispin, and his cousin Arnie, a fallen super hero who ends up working in Las Vegas.

This show is incredibly silly and does break several sit-com rules, but season one is definately worth picking up!",1168905600,2,791,5.171875

8109961,5,B000EHQU12,"One of my favorite British TV series ever;  I've bought all the series  DVDs that are available in either the UK or the US (one of the benefits of a multi-region DVD player). This is where to begin, and the series picks up steam for at least three more series. But WHERE are the rest of the shows?  Only the first three series have been released.  Series 4 is superb but I've had to retain my VHS tapings off TV for what I have from this and later seasons (not counting the replacement George, I stopped watching at that point as those sort of cast changes are always the kiss of death for a program).  Please issue the remainder of the classic episodes at least!  Buyers on both sides of the Atlantic are waiting!",1468195200,,714,4.291044776119403
