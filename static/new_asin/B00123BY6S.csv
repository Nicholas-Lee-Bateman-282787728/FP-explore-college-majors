3071521,5,B00123BY6S,"***EDIT NOTE (August 7th, 2008)***
I have learned from IGN that by the end of this year - early 2009 at the latest - all 5 seasons of THE WIRE will be released in a box set.  I will write a review once Amazon puts up an item for purchase.

If you want to go in fresh, then I suggest not reading any Season Five reviews.  But if you've already started, then read on.  I've done everything possible to avoid spoilers, yet critique from my own point of view.

***ORIGINAL REVIEW***
Typing reviews on TV seasons can be problematic.  If you're a newcomer to the series who just wants to know whether THE WIRE held up through all 60 episodes, the short answer is a resounding ""Yes!""  This series took big chances with each season, and each episode was carefully constructed and executed.  They don't call this show a ""visual novel"" for nothing.  THE WIRE is easily the most realistic TV series ever produced, and mastered the art of slow build-up.

But for those who missed out on Season Five, I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible.  If you're looking for a debate, go to IMDB --- you'll find plenty to fight about.

Trying to discuss plot threads and outlines of this Season would take an entire website, so let's split this up into the key players:

THE POLICE
---Season Five lets the Major Case Squad return to its roots as they track Marlo Stanfield, but the twist is that the entire police force is underpaid with morale at an all-time low.  Whatever happened to Baltimore's economy since last year has crippled the cops from doing good policework, let alone keep the stats at an acceptable level.  The few individuals who're motivated to work the cases, however, choose a shockingly unethcial approach.  This approach (which I don't want to give away) opens up the classic question: ""Do the ends justify the means?""  Some fans thought this scenario was unbelieveable, but I say there've been more elaborate methods of deceit in this country's history.  The police department's ethics and morals are really put through the ringer, this time.  You might have to take a grain of salt, but I think most viewers will grow to love the cops' creativity by the series' end.  Also, we finally get some closure on the past between Daniels & Burell, but in true WIRE fashion, we don't learn everything.  Overall, the threads involving Baltimore law enforcement worked very well, in my opinion.

THE POLITICS
---There is some sweet material here, even though it's basically two stories.  The first is Clay Davis's fate.  I couldn't have predicted any of the twists that followed, and still can't believe them after I think about it.  I'm very impressed that a minor colorful character really evolved into one of the Season's most memorable figures --- just when you think you've witnessed the climax, Davis's tale comes back with another layer.  Also in THE WIRE's political focus is Tommy Carcetti's ongoing struggle to balance his ambition and his civic duties.  These scenes were well-acted, but I was disappointed that nothing really changed within the offices.  I know that's the point of the story, but it only works for so many consecutive episodes.  However, I still think that Season Five portrays a good examination of general politics, warts and all.

THE STREETS
---Both my favorite and least favorite aspect of Season Five.  Marlo Stanfield and his crew lay low, and kinda toy with the cops a bit in the first episode.  ""The Game"" of the drug trade no longer has room for the idealists from seasons' past; this generation's players are more eager to violence and swift resolutions.  I'm glad THE WIRE never becomes a bloodbath, but I'm disappointed that such cold violence failed to grip me.  My problems with this part of the story were mainly because I didn't care enough about the dealers.  Marlo, Snoop, Partlow, Slim Charles, Cheese, and Prop Joe...the actors are all up to the task, but the story wasn't as brilliant as its predecesors.  Even the arcs involving teens Michael and Duquan didn't move me a lot, which surprising because they're such tragic characters; it's scary to think the real world is even harder on America's lower-class youth.  However, keep in my mind I'm disappointed by THE WIRE's standards --- these tough scenes surpass any other TV urban drama.  Where Season Five is at its best is with our everyman Bubbles.  Andre Royo's performance treads delicately between subtle and dramatic, and he's never been better in the role.  Bubbles represents every person in the world: if you give your attention to even the smallest person, a compelling story is waiting to come out.  Speaking of stories...

THE NEWSROOM
---Each season, THE WIRE reveals a new side of Baltimore.  For Season Five, we meet the press from inside the Baltimore Sun.  The editing room vibe is just as important as the characters who inhabit them.  Everyone from the greedy management to disillusioned veterans, and from ambitious journalists to a stoic editor jump on a hot story --- the only catch is that some of Baltimore's finest may not be so fine after all.  Clearly, David Simon (creator/writer) knows this field like the back of his hand.  Even if you didn't know he used to be a Baltimore Sun reporter, you'd swear Simon lived within this arena.  I think most of Season Five's detractors focused on this story arc.  My only real gripe is that the Sun's management isn't given enough depth: we've seen these bosses a million times before (they'll do anything for the greatest profit, or coverage, regardless of quality).  Like the Streets angle, the actors are pitch-perfect, but the story had a few more yards to go.  Still, conflicted journalism is always an interesting subject, and THE WIRE did an excellent job with it.

CLOSING THOUGHTS
---THE WIRE is a show we'll never get again.  The acting is flawless; what I mean is that no character dominates the show.  From start to finish, everyone on THE WIRE shares an equal prescence.  The writing is also superb, especially when watching on DVD.  How did we ever survive the week-by-week schedule?  THE WIRE is much stronger when you take it all in one sitting.

Sadly, Season Five is easily my least favorite for two reasons.
AND PLEASE STOP READING IF YOU WANT NOTHING SPOILED!

*  Each episode features a brief cameo from previous seasons' cast.  Cameos and guest appearances are fine, but very few of them contributed anything unique.  For example: Cutty gets a few brief scenes with Duquan.  Cutty basically tells the confused teen that he doesn't know what the world holds for us.  It's nice to see them interact, but the ideas are a bit recycled.  THE WIRE has always been able to give us little details without distracting from the big picture.  In Season Five, these cameos took me out of the moment.

*  But here is my biggest problem with Season Five:
First off, some fans didn't like how THE WIRE jumped from the streets to the docks, or how one year suddenly became about school children and not the police.  However, no one can deny THE WIRE was always tried to expand its horizons.  This is a fact.
Where Season Five slips up is that David Simon tries to resolve just about everything.  I always thought this show was stronger when some issues remained ambiguous, and when not every question was answered.  There was a sense of irony in each season's resolution.  But in THE WIRE's final act, Simon apparently couldn't let some questions go.  The Series Finale is superb, no doubt.  But Simon's attempt to connect everything together makes the world of Baltimore feel much smaller.

Maybe THE WIRE is about an interconnected world after all.

However, don't let my little nitpicks prevent any of you from watching this outstanding series' conclusion.
If you're a fan, you're gonna pick up Season Five anyway.
If you're a skeptic, have faith and spend the money.
If you're a newcomer to the series, I envy you.  Your first trip ""Way Down In The Hole"" is one you'll never forget.",1207180800,69,7956,4.767935578330893
3071522,5,B00123BY6S,"In all my years of watching TV, I can say without reservation that The Wire is the finest production ever brought to the small screen.  The measure of a good movie, play or TV show is rooted in the story telling and therefore the writing.  The Wire with its complex drawn characters has elevated the art of story telling to a level that surpasses what I thought to be the most important work ever produced on TV, Hill Street Blues.  I imagine that if Hill Street Blues had the advantages of The Wire (cable vs. network TV), it too would have provided the core realisim so evident in The Wire.

Kudos to HBO for bringing such a brilliant production to the screen.  This is a cable network that knows what it is doing (The Sapranos, Sex in the City, Six Feet Under, the list goes on and on).

The assembly of actors (none of which I had ever seen before, save for a few) was, in itself, casting at its zenith.  The direction, cinematography, second to none.  What was most impressive was the way in which characters were drawn.  Street dealers with a rudimentary code of honor (i.e., Sunday as the peace day among the gangs) and smarts normally not associated with this element.  Politicians who start out with the ""I want to do good and change the world"" idealisim and end up in the same space as all other politicians they started out dispising. The story of the docks and that of the schools and school kids we got to follow the last 2 seasons was as compelling a story as I have ever seen portrayed.  What was most impressive was the way in which the show ended its run.  No feel good endings (for the most part) where everything turns out right.  What you got was the truth; the cycle of the streets, the cycle of the docks, the cycle of the schools and school kids, the cycle of the politicians, the cycle of life which is just that; an unending cylcle of some good but mostly the same.

The Wire is the kind of TV that comes along once in a life time.  The critics got it, the award shows never did.  I suggest the subject matter was a little too gritty for their taste.  I implore anyone who reads this review and appreciates the finer elements of movie making to purchase all 5 seasons of The Wire as I have.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1207180800,24,2258,4.323040380047506

3071527,5,B00123BY6S,"The Wire (2002-2008) is excellent. It paved the way for an even better drug crime show, Breaking Bad (2008-2013).

Most people are aware of corporate espionage and what some companies will do to protect their secrets. In the TV show Breaking Bad the two main characters, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, and Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, possess the knowledge and skill to produce the best meth on the market. And their brand is easily identifiable by its unique blue color.

Several competing criminal organizations buy their services and try to replicate their product but Whites and Pinkmans skill in the art and science of making their blue meth product isn't easily duplicated. One group tries to hold Pinkman hostage in Mexico because their highly trained scientists cant make meth as well as he does. Near the end of the series another criminal group keeps Pinkman chained in their lab and force him to make meth for them because their guy, who worked with both White and Pinkman, is unable to duplicate Pinkmans and Walter Whites skill in the art and science of making their blue meth brand.

Breaking Bad has one of the best story and character arcs ever used in a TV show, which is why it has an IMDb rating of 9.5, right up there with Game of Thrones, another great show. The Wire (2002-2008) was as good as the Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014), but not as good as Breaking Bad. I won't give away the ending of Breaking Bad, but if you watch the complete series, from the first episode to the last, the ending will make complete sense and be very satisfying. Its terrific.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,2634,5.073903002309469

3071533,5,B00123BY6S,"Wow! I've seen a lot of great series on television and this is by far, one of the best! The characters, the storyline and the way everything was portrayed, simply AMAZING! I love how the producers tied everything together and really tell the story of most big cities in America, from the drug dealers and ""hoppers"" to the police and it's chain of command; they even tied in politics, showing how dirty some will get to get where/what they want. I especially liked the last season, as they did a great job at bringing everything home and leaving all the characters on fairly good terms with the audience. I'm glad we got to see ""bubbs"" make it through his addiction and begin to lead a life of recuperation and happiness; in the same breath, I'm disappointed that ""dukie"" has taken an inevitable turn for the worse into drugs. Although in the beginning McNulty wasn't too pleasing of a character, by this last season I definitely took a liking to him. Because of his boldness and courage, along with Detective Freamon, they were able to take down Marlo and his crew and account for most of the crime and drug trafficking occurring in the neighborhood. I loved almost all the characters, however, my absolute favorite was Omar because of his wittiness and old school charisma. While most of his actions were downright despicable, you can't help but to think there's a lot of good in him. With that being said, it hurt me to my core to see him killed in S5, especially in the way in which it was done; if anything, that would be my only criticism.

3071556,5,B00123BY6S,"The Wire is a gritty and gripping detective drama, which is widely considered to be one of the all-time best shows in this genre, as well as being one of the greatest television programs ever made. It was created and primarily written by David Simon, the renowned author and former crime reporter, who, because of his background, was able to impart an uncanny sense of realism to the series. The Wire was set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland, and its story line centers around the organization and function of the criminal drug trade in Baltimore, and the tragic way in which it has ravaged the city, and its beleaguered residents. The Wire consists of a total of sixty episodes, spanning five seasons, with a different emphasis for each season. Although the multifaceted drug trade represents the overarching focus of this series, each individual season assesses the manner in which this criminal enterprise impacts a specific operational area of the city of Baltimore. The first season of The Wire examines the drug trade itself, the second season deals with the dysfunctional seaport system, the third season analyzes the corrupt city government and bureaucracy, the fourth season addresses the deteriorating school system, and the fifth and final season evaluates the unethical print news media. It brutally and realistically depicts the devastating effects that the criminal narcotic trade has had on the residents of inner city Baltimore, whose lives have been destroyed by the pervasive drug-related misery, despair, and hopelessness, which have now become endemic in this population. The Wire is characterized by insightful and brilliant writing, superb plot and character development, and absolutely spectacular acting performances, by its exceedingly talented ensemble cast. It definitely deserves the numerous awards and accolades which it has received over its five-year run. The Wire is a truly outstanding television series, which is riveting, moving, and emotional, and it merits an unequivocal five-star rating, along with a very strong recommendation.",1499299200,3,2071,5.414860681114551

The acting and the writing always make a great show and with all this ""Reality"" junk on today  ""The Wire "" is a home run. No commercials and you don't have to wait 6 months for the next season.

3071603,5,B00123BY6S,Best series of all time,1486166400,,23,3.8
3071604,4,B00123BY6S,"The 5th and final season of The Wire wraps up the storylines of the previous seasons, not into a bow tie present (because a 'perfect', happy ending wouldn't be consistent with the show's history and overall tone), but in a satisfyingly disturbing way.  Lauded as the most 'realistic' crime drama, I will say it is one of the best.  I've seen SouthLAnd, The Shield, Low Winter Sun, Hannibal, Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, Dexter and the likes, and this is arguably in the top 3, with SOA & Dexter at the bottom and The Shield, Breaking Bad & The Wire fighting for the top contender.

It's a shame that the final season of this show only had 10 episodes, compared the last few seasons that got 12 or 13.  Because of this, it goes by a little quicker and it feels like there could've been at least 2 more episodes to show the repercussions of the actions in the final season, as well as give more characters a send off; however, some characters to pop up from previous seasons to show us where they've been or what happened to them.

One thing's for sure, this gritty crime drama pulls no punches, shows the most realistic, fake take on police, politics, the media, gangs, the public schools and the street life out there.  There is a liberal slant to the perspective, but it is very realistic nonetheless, and the raw emotion in the life-like appearance, character and power in the stories will resonate with anyone tied to law enforcement, criminal justice, EMS, urban life, or government sector.  As a police-affiliated worker, I can see a lot of the realities from this show in the real life individuals I interact with while at work. The Wire's not perfect, but it's close.  Many will say this or Breaking Bad are the best of the best. Watch the Wire, and you win either way.  Play with your life in the streets, and you lose either way: that's what The Wire teaches us.

***DVD note***

The version I got IS NOT the slim line, newer 2015 version that is described in the product description.  The other Wire seasons that I purchased through Amazon were all the newer, slim case versions of the dvds just as described, but not this one for some reason.",1486080000,4,2155,4.525773195876289

The newspaper storyline never really gets as exciting or dramatic as other subjects the series touched on over the years, but it does work with the main homeless murders story arc to bring new levels of absurdist entertainment to the last season.  It's probably the funniest season of the series, too.

3071769,5,B00123BY6S,"2004-2008 the David Simon, and Ed Burns returned to Baltimore, and produced this show to speak to the dysfunction in our cities.  The Wire depicts the complex interaction of heroin, broken families, street survival, lazy-ass police, money laundering, and the tribal politics that feeds-on and protects all of the above.  At the bottom, the street is a perpetual war, kids are soldiers, death comes quick, almost as a favor.  Look hard Humanists - human beings are fallen creatures, everybody, we'd rather screw, get high and kill than improve ourselves or our lot.  Only God has the answer to this.  America was built on His principles, it never worked entirely, mankind is incapable of following His plan, but the attempt was better than this.  Don't lie, respect your neighbor's property, respect life, respect your spouse, respect authority, let love into your heart, love God, and know there is only one God, and he is not that pile of cash, power, or the sex-object or substance that gets you off.",1482969600,,1002,4.934523809523809

3071924,5,B00123BY6S,"I loved the authenticity of the story. For years I worked in Philadelphia's worst areas for drugs, murder, and crime, and The Wire depicts an accurate description of the absolute cold-hearted, sociopathic ways of the streets.  People getting killed just on suspicion of something they ""might have said,"" or because the money or drug count was short.  It's a nasty, cruel way to live, but for so many, this is all they know. Children suffer greatly. Education suffers- police are corrupt, higher up officials are corrupt.  Money disappears into the government's deep pockets.  Families are torn apart and every community is affected.  It is like a pebble dropped in water. The poison all spreads out from the unfortunate losers who are the pebble, and who have so much power and street smarts that their layers may go so deep that their dirt may never be swept off the streets and it just keeps piling up. It becomes overwhelming at best.  If you want a realistic, well written, and superbly acted  police story- this is it.

3071928,5,B00123BY6S,"Living in the Baltimore metro area and following the news - the Wire gives an excellent insight as to why the drug trade is prevalent and deadly in Baltimore city. The lawyers, police and politicians are all part of the problem along with the crushing poverty in the inner city, the bad schools, fatherless homes thanks to the government handouts of EBT cards, welfare, section 8 housing vouchers and healthcare keeps the women in the community dependent on the government. It's as if they're married to the government. In several episodes the series showed how they're not very parents and the system lets them get away with childish behavior even though it detrimental to the emotional and physical development of their kids.

Watching the wire and from my own observations and experience over the past 40 years I can now better understand how so many black youths end up in the drug trade and how hard it is for them to escape the environment they were born in.",1478908800,,964,4.738095238095238

3072154,5,B00123BY6S,I'm sure I watched at least some of the series when it originally aired as I could remember bits and pieces of different episodes. My wife and I watched all 5 seasons during the last two months. We'd try and catch one or two episodes each night when we were free for TV watching. The first couple of seasons were outstanding. A cop friend from that area said the episodes were as close as you can get to the real thing. The street culture of the ghetto (if it is politically correct to use the term) was rather shocking to those of us who have led a sheltered life. Its easy to see why very few young people escape to a better life. The last 3 seasons were good. It was interesting to follow the various characters. Now too many of the residents made it alive to the end of the series. The value of life to these gangsters is shocking. It is easy to see why the carnage in Chicago is at the level it is this year. And in the end at the close of season 5 life on the street was the same as when the show started on season 1. Only the characters changed.,1475539200,,1052,4.0625

3072194,3,B00123BY6S,Not as good as the prior four seasons. This show tends to grab one main theme and run with it during the seasons with side stories to carry it through. I did not in particular enjoy this one as it circles the newspaper as the main story line. It could have ended better and some great characters were killed that I was rooting for. My final review is to watch this season to finish the series. Not many shows have great last seasons anymore and this is one of them....sad.,1475107200,,472,4.2555555555555555

The Wire has done an excellent job of giving almost every character a voice and this compels the viewer to connect with, and route for, the majority of the main characters at any given time. The realism and raw imagery help paint the picture of the harder side of Baltimore.

Scary to think there are people as cold and heartless as Marlo on my streets.  With all the ""Black Lives Matter"" protests and casualties of the war on drugs you would think that people would realize that it is not ""the man"" that is their enemy, that it is one another.

Four was.... as long as you want to learn ALL the permutation uses of the F word

I would (and have) recommended this show to others. As I was swept up into the story, I started getting close to characters which surprised me, Omar and Bubbles to be more specific. Yet I couldn't care less about what happened to McNulty. Again, the art at its best. If you do watch, give the show a chance. It takes a couple of episodes to get used to the language (lingo, not necessarily the cursing).",1473638400,,556,4.626262626262626

3072373,5,B00123BY6S,"Although Season Two, for me, still has the greatest resonance of all the years of the series, Season Five towers above almost all other tv shows. Season Five's additional focus, with governmental corruption and inefficiencies and, of course the drug trade, is on print journalism. At the time the season was filmed, print journalism hadn't yet entered the degree of the death spiral it's in now. The story line does include the declining fortunes of the Baltimore paper it focuses on. A central focus, ripped from headlines of that era, is on a reporter who fabricates the crux of his stories. A particularly inventive subplot - hats off to all of those at the writers table - has McNulty creating a fictitious series of serial murders. He does so in order to use some of the extra man hours allotted to the search for the nonexistent killer in his effort to bring down drug kingpin Marlo Stanfield. As with every season of this show, volumes could be written about all the plot elements and their links to actual events and the continuing tragedies that befall not only Baltimore but many of our inner cities. It's such a pleasure when that occasional show that examines the current state of the country succeeds.",1473033600,5,1214,4.758293838862559

3072472,5,B00123BY6S,"And this series doesnt. Ever.

Is this review even necessary? I suppose so, since everyones tastes are different. That said, in MY opinion(which is my own), The Wires the best tv show ever produced. Several others have come close, but this is, for me, as good as it gets. That said, season 5 to me is the 'weakest' of the 5 seasons and I'm giving it 5 stars. That's saying something. This show not just excellent, its CONSISTENTLY excellent. I did not watch this when it first came out. Hell I hadnt even HEARD of it when it first came out (probably because I didn't have HBO at the time).

When I found it? My entire extended weekend was spent watching. And I'm not a binge watcher by nature. I just could not get enough. That said, if you're looking at season 5, you've seen the other 4, and there's about 0% chance you will NOT pick up the last season even if I gave it 0 stars. I'd challenge anyone to watch the first 4 seasons and have no interest in seeing how the series ends. Not possible in my opinion.

So, in short(sort of)- get it, watch it, love it, rinse, repeat. Thats not sarcasm- I've watched this entire series probably seven times through and STILL would not be able to pass it up if I saw it on my channel lineup.",1470787200,,1233,4.260683760683761

3072561,5,B00123BY6S,"It is my view that 'The Wire' is one of the finest series ever produced for television.  It is gutsy, hard-hitting, and more accurate at every level than most would like to admit.  Season 5 is a first rate close to the series.  Good and Evil, the Merely Bad and the Dishonest flourish with aplomb.  The characters, even some of the truly evil ones, are extremely well drawn and in their own twisted way, sympathetic.  I have never seen a series that mirrored real life and a specific city so accurately....as recent history has proven.",1469404800,,535,4.589473684210526

The addition of the ""Baltimore Sun"" really didn't do it for me! It was a let down in comparison to all the other seasons! I really hate this show didn't continue though!

3072598,2,B00123BY6S,Was not as good as the first two.  Useless newspaper actors... Took up too much screen and no one really cares about that stupid storyline.  Omar's character was the best!!! Too bad they ended it the way they did... Very anticlimactic ... All in it was just a season to wrap up the storyline. It was not done very well.  Oh well,1469232000,,328,4.258064516129032

The first 3 seasons were the best from my perspective. ALL the actors were fabulous. They made it so realistic with the quality of acting and the dialogue/mannerisms.

3072731,5,B00123BY6S,"This show uses a lot of police jargon, street slang, and court room and does not explain it so you have to use context clues or look it up to completely understand. The 5th season started slow to me but then it got really good then it became amazing. This is a very well though out story and is a true work of art. You really need to pay attention to when they talk because things will happen off camera and will not make any sense if you do not remember what they were talking about earlier. The character development is very realistic and impressive. Some part were very boring to me, but as the show went on, I became more invested in the dialogue and the frequency at which I was bored decreased. The best part of this series in my opinion are the characters. You may grow to love and hate some of them. Even when you do not agree with them, you kind of hope things end up okay for them. If you like crime dramas in general, then this series is for you.",1467331200,,957,4.122994652406417

3072994,5,B00123BY6S,The entire series is fantastic but the opening part of season 5 is perhaps the best acting that I've ever seen in my life. Having work for a police department when I was younger it's very easy to assume that some of these young kids are just that stupid and are the victims of their own ignorance when dealing with the police and criminal situations. Everyone that I talk to you comes from the Baltimore area always tell similar stories that are expressed in the episode on The Wire. This is one show where you binge watch all 5 Seasons and it's like watching a Masterpiece Theater. The writing is simply brilliant and is able to capture the urban flavor of Baltimore perfectly. The only negative thing I can say is that there's only 5 Seasons and not more. But all good things must come to an end and this definitely is a good thing.,1465257600,,834,4.387096774193548

A cold and emotionless soul, with lifeless eyes and demeanor to match. Our four middle school boys are each off on a separate path to who knows where.
The Baltimore Police Department is giving it their best effort, but is it enough.  Crocked politicians and unethical lawyers add to the mix.

3073366,4,B00123BY6S,"It was a great show telling a story of survival  and struggle for everyday people that view life differently, but are the same in many ways. They seem to be different, but the lake (work) they fish out of brings them into conflict with each other. The web of deceit and corruption cross over into both worlds (justice-criminal). It's hard to gain control of a situation that is causing so much destruction in an environment or society when the solution or the corrective forces become a willing player in the problem.

Over all, great show with real  live and dramatic life telling issues that grip our society today.

The white mayor and his black advisors fair no better as they make decisions based on what will benefit them politically without regard for the people of the city or people employed by the city.

In literature circles, they used to say there were the Dostoevsky people and the Tolstoy people.  This one was definitely for the Dostoevsky people.  The terrible, the beautiful, and the funny, all tied into one.

While the series did ""juke the stats"" occasionally for pleasing a wider contemporary audience, this is not a serious criticism -  it has never stopped art from becoming timeless.  I predict this one ages well.",1461542400,,538,4.857142857142857

3073563,2,B00123BY6S,"This series built up to a giant let down.  Lots of promising character development and increasingly complex story lines lead to a final season of killing off the series's best character with no explanation, a boring side story of a dysfunctional newspaper, and a department cover up so unrealistic it's comical.

Each of the others seasons had well thought out plot lines and outstanding character arcs.  The police procedural was woven nicely into the story of Baltimore and each finale neatly wrapped everything up without rushing the narrative.  Not with this season...within the premier episode alone an entire story line is completely wiped out with no explanation, and the series ends with a very corny full circle mantra about how nothing ever really changes, having characters with very compelling narratives simply filling the shoes of characters from previous seasons.  Nothing is wrapped up, and at the same time nothing is left to the imagination.  The best characters in the series are either killed off or written out abruptly, and the season comes to an end with a friend's betraying McNulty's lie just shrugged off like it was no big deal.  Who wrote this garbage?  The newspaper side story as a parallel of the department was a snooze fest, and there was absolutely no reason to invest in any of the characters there, save for Gus, which was simply a placeholder instead of a dynamic piece of the story line.

I don't get into many TV series, but I was really enjoying this one...that is until season 5.  This was, without doubt, the worst series ender I have ever watched.  If everything was going to just the same as when the series began, then why watch anything at all?  Why introduce the notion that Leavy could finally burn like the scum he is only to turn the final showdown between him and Ronnie into a draw?  And what of Herc?  He becomes nothing but a sidekick to Leavy.....for what?  He nearly served no purpose except to advance a forced exposition.  Nothing in this series makes any sense.  Colvin had the chance to take a pop shot at the mayor....but nothing happens.  Why set any of this up if it was all just impotent?  This season had absolutely no point, other than to mark a official end to the series.

What a waste of time.",1461456000,2,2262,4.707379134860051

The end scenes were fine, showing the cycle and how one bad guy is replaced by another... there's a new Omar, a new group running the corner, etc. The war on drugs seems futile.
Overall, The Wire was a good series. I just was really disappointed with season 5. McNulty was supposed to be that good cop with some bad habits but season 5 made me despise McNulty. I wanted him to go to jail. His character deviated too much, along with the fabricated storyline.",1459209600,,628,4.285714285714286

I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys quality programming.  I even bought the soundtrack -- it was pure genius.  I can certainly understand why Harvard had some of the actors speak on the situation in the inner cities and the effect this has had on our African-American youth.

The fact that David Simon focuses on the plight of the newspaper industry, which has gotten much worse since Season Five's original airing, brings the story full circle. In addition, pay special attention to reporter Scott Templeton, viewers may think he is a farcical character, but he is not. As a former newspaper reporter, I worked with an editor with his kind of ethics. Once again, The Wire delivers. It is arguably the greatest television series of all time.",1457308800,,568,4.989473684210527

And the sad thing is that this show is a prime example of how government works today - it's not a matter of what you've done or what you know, it's a matter of who you are or who you are connected to.  Sad but true.

The Ugly: Corrupt Leadership, people that abuse their authority and FAIL to serve the people.

Marlo is back and as dangerous as ever. The newspaper angle and the newsroom characters, lead by Clark Johnson, are as entertaining as the police characters. Irony abounds. It's hard not to root for even some of the bad guys - Omar, Proposition Joe, and Michael. Possibly the most well-written show ever on TV.

3073913,4,B00123BY6S,"Went on a binge with The Wire as I had not seen it in a long time and I'm not sure if I ever saw season 5.  McNulty has gone far over even his shady edge when he concocts a serial killer so that the mayor, Carcetti, desperate for some positive press, will funnel money to the police. Some of this money goes to Freaman in his on-going attempt to bring in Marlo. This season focuses on the roll of the press in helping McNulty pull off his scheme so there's a cast of half dozen reporters for The Sun.  So the typical triangle between police--city hall--and this time the press continues.  This is the last season, however, so there is a sense that the characters are taking their last laps as we see many who have become so familiar continue to develop--the end provides a very satisfying review of what seems to be going to happen to them now that we can't watch anymore.  A very satisfying conclusion to a great show.",1456617600,,919,4.294797687861272

So I suggest that maybe, just maybe you should just WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE.

3073983,5,B00123BY6S,"Because of the depth of subject and how well it was presented I again give the wire 5 stars.  I must warn that it is extremely vulgar and racist because the content requires it to be so.  Adults who want an inside look at gang politics, police and govt politics and how the 2 clash each day should see this series.  Although without giving too much up about the final season, it does try to bring closure to some of the issues from the first 4 seasons.  However I don't know how one can leave the series without the feeling that cities just will not be able to find a solution to the violence and death within the gang society. Sure I can say without a doubt that the destruction of the family structure..... easy divorce....lack of work income,... poor education by the school system .. DRUGS and DRUG MONEY.contribute to the on going structure survival and that structure is so strong it seems impossible for govt and authority to break.  This series will affect how you view the gangs and kids looking for family.",1455667200,,1016,4.47027027027027

3074028,5,B00123BY6S,"Season 5 of The Wire is the season that ties everything closed.  McNulty finally rams is head deep up his 6.  He goes too far - even for McNulty.

Over the past five seasons we've had the Barksdale's and Stringer Bell, Omar and Butchie, Prop Joe and the quoram, the Greek, the  Russians, the containers and the unions.  We've had Tommy Carcetti, Clay Davis, and many others. Cedric Daniels has risen from a dime a dozen Lieutenant to the Deputy Chief of Operations.  We've had fantastic writing from writers who seem truly proud of their work.

The Wire is a whirlwind of great television.  The characters are still week written it's as though we are introduced to a living family.

The Wire is not to be taken lightly.  This is absolutely great stuff.  Here are characters and situations we can believe in.  Here lies the best of the best.",1455580800,8,840,4.563758389261745

3074036,4,B00123BY6S,"Very few shows deserve a 5 star rating but ""The Wire"" comes close. This series is tense, dark, sadly pessimistic, well constructed and edited. It certainly presents a dim view of human beings in the contemporary failing big US city (eg, Chicago, now!). The 5th is a well constructed finale to a brilliant series, but uses a few contrived or exaggerated premises to achieve the less than optimistic conclusion. In this way it is not as successful as the first 4 seasons and almost borders on the frequent manipulation of plot one encounters in the good, but not great films and TV dramas.

Season 5 brings back McNulty as a full-blown alcoholic with none of his earlier screen presence, running a scam on ""the bosses"" with a fake serial killer.  There's a very shallow portrayal of a newsroom, with Omar coming back as some kind of superman.

  All of your favorite characters turn out to be just idols with feet of clay, and the worst characters of the series are allowed to remain around to ruin the credibility of the storylines.  The Wire had just enough juice for the first three seasons.

3074077,5,B00123BY6S,"In all honesty this has to be one of the best shows ever on television.  The series has had it's ups and it's downs or should I say high points and lows, with the highs being as good as TV has ever been and the lows being really good TV but sub-par for this series.  Season 5 I would put right in the middle.  If you've watched the other 4 seasons you can see the end coming from a mile away when season 5 starts.  And that's probably the only reason I put season 5 in the middle.  I found myself not being enamored with the story line that set up the end of one of my favorite shows of all time.

Collectively this season was another expert and meticulous look at the inner workings of part of Baltimore's fabric.  This time it was the newspaper world.  But this is a look at newspapers like you've never seen on the screen.  You could just feel how real this was.  The characters were expertly written and perfectly portrayed. The issues they faced are real and not exaggerated for effect.

It was a sad moment hitting play on the last episode but all told it wrapped the series in quality fashion.  If you haven't watched this series don't start with season 5, please.  More likely you've watched the first 4 already if you're reading this so here is my ranking off the top of my head.  Season 1, Season 4, Season 5, Season 3 and then Season 2; ranked best to worst.  Like I said this is on The Wire scale, which most tv shows wouldn't even rate on.  Season 3 and 5 could easily be switched here for me.  The recency effect is probably in play.",1454976000,,1547,4.189830508474576

3074191,4,B00123BY6S,"The Wire was a very well written and very well filmed series which I plan to watch (all 5 seasons) once again.  The concept for the series is that it is all connected.  The success of the drug trade is related to how well the police are able to function which is related to priorities and pressures the politicians are exerting and so on.  The episodes do not stand alone like an NCIS or Elementary but rather each one feeds into the next more like a Downton Abbey or 24 except, of course, The Wire is much grittier because much of it takes place in the rougher neighborhoods of Baltimore.  It's a great insight into the inner city challenges faced in all of our larger cities.

3074228,1,B00123BY6S,Weak,1453680000,,4,4.0
3074229,4,B00123BY6S,I've been binge watching this series since mid December when everything went into reruns and specials. I'm not sure why I didn't watch this show when it originally aired but I've enjoyed all 5 seasons. At the time of this review I'm only half way through season 5 (the final season) so not sure if the ending of the series will be satisfying. Each season the focus of the story changed while remaining true to the first season. So far season 5 seems to be the weakest season which may be why there were no more after season 5. In a nutshell it's a series about drug trafficking in Baltimore along with corrupt politicians and cops and some of the people that wanted to clean it up. Great series and worth watching.,1453680000,,714,4.416666666666667

3074234,5,B00123BY6S,"OK just saw all 5 seasons in about 30 days, luckily I can watch a series that way, no commercials, no long term drawn out time frame, I love to watch an entire series, you can call me a monogamous serial-ist. One series at a time, if its a good one, like The Wire, its the only way to go, as far as I am concerned, like learning a language through immersion. I am now immersed and fluent in this series.

I will give it a 98%. For Season 5, for the entire 5 season Series. It wiggles between a 92% and 100% episode to episode, but the overall average is stellar. Why? Because the show is consistently top shelf; consistently lacking in cliches, consistently dealing with moral ambiguity, heroic endeavoring, the counterpoint of local politics, local business, local police procedural, local education, local News reporting and writing, the poor, the rich,the lazy, the ambitious, the honest, the deceitful, the straightforward and the deceptive. The disciplined, the addicted, the gentle and the violent, the powerless and the powerful and the competitions between members of all these existing groups, and between rival groups, and between various aforementioned civic interests. Its about the law, the laws, the judges, organized crime, wiretapping, information gathering, and in fighting and backstabbing, and love,lust and murder, and money. Sounds like a far reaching show? Hell yeah, it is all over the place, but it rings true because it all seems to be about the same thing, everything is the same thing-temptation, greed, ego, honor, protection, teaming up, going rogue. Accountability, and betrayal.

Like a Shakespearean play, it ties together the many sides of the Human Condition in an ironic and artful expose on Human frailties, shortcomings and Heroic stands leading to the saving of people that are loved. I couldn't stop watching it, it moved me viscerally and intellectually and artistically,over and over, scene by scene. For me, it was a tremendous experience and an unforgettable 5 year show, all consumed in 30 days, wow. 98% is perhaps an unfairly low score, but I don't wish to seem blindly exuberant, and so I will leave it that. All performances were tremendous, there isn't a bad actor among the cast. The leading ensemble was superb. Bravo, Bravo, Bravo.",1453593600,5,2283,4.989501312335958

3074341,4,B00123BY6S,"The entire series is good. It just never really pulled me all of the way in like other series did. But, that's just me. I never really felt connected to any one character, except maybe for Omar. In the face of what his life was, he still had good character. The last season was my least favorite. I felt by brining in the newspaper side of things, being the last season, they didn't have enough time to develop it, and it felt sort of stacked on top. Too bad they didn't do it sooner. There isn't anything wrong with the series. The acting is top notch. The script language is excellent and authentic. It just never completely immersed me.  (Also, in one scene in I think Episode 9, you can see a dead guy in the coroner's place breath. lol He's was the black guy next to Omar.",1449100800,,777,4.25

Worthwhile.",1446336000,,408,4.746478873239437

In this last season we see how the frustrated cops who actually care about change are forced to resort to working around the system, breaking rules and placing themselves and their jobs in jeopardy in order to actually do some good.

Favorite characters:  Omar Little (Michael Kenneth Williams), Reginald ""Bubbles"" Cousins (Andre Royo); actually I loved them all, too many to name.  McNulty (Dominic West) was hard to like, manipulative, impulsive and selfish, but very well-acted.  One of his best scenes was when the FBI profiler was describing the (made-up) serial killer in Season 5, and it sounded exactly like McNulty (who made him up to get city money freed up for police overtime for real police work).  McNulty's look - recognizing himself in the description - was priceless.",1442275200,,716,5.129310344827586

However, by this season the inter-connection between different gang characters and their inner workings were just way too cumbersome to follow.  I lost track of who was putting a hit on who and why.  I simply did not care because it didn't really appear material to the subject of each episode.  I think it was over-done since every episode of this season had one gang killing another gang member.  If the season was intended to send a message of senseless violence, it succeeded.  But after a while, it became routine and loses it's punch.",1441843200,,690,4.7

3074738,3,B00123BY6S,"I watched the entire 5 seasons.  Realistic.  Well done.  Raw.  The series portrayed the city of Baltimore's problems with race relations, police abuses, educational deficiencies, drug traffic,

major crime,  and abusive politics.  The conclusion that I reached about Baltimore was that after all is said and done the city was faced with the same old s__t and only the flies changed.  Nothing positive about outlook.

I don't know if that is true, but I certainly think it's up there. Not knowing who was going to survive from episode to episode kept me on the edge of my seat and as I got more invested in the characters as the series progressed I didn't want it to end, yet I felt it ended gracefully and was completely happy with it. Fantastic season and ending for a terrific show!",1441238400,,482,4.08421052631579
3074755,5,B00123BY6S,"For me, The Wire is the best tv show ever. That said,  the first time I watched season 5 I didn't find it as strong as the other seasons. This time, I think it as great as others. The difference is that they were having fun. All The Wire's clich are present and repeated: ""It's Baltimore"", ""Police work"" and the corners. Marlo Stanfield going to fight for a corner wearing suit was too much for me the first time, too easy, too clich. But now I think: they were saying goodbye to their characters and having fun! As well as us, ""spectators"".",1441238400,,541,4.303921568627451
3074756,4,B00123BY6S,"The Wire Season 5 is very serviceable entertainment. It fails to live up to previous year (arguably, the greatest year of television in history) and feels like somewhat of a let down in comparison. The storyline of Bunk and Mcnulty feels particularly ridiculous and stretched. However, it is still miles ahead of 95% of the other dramas out there, and deserves a chance simply based upon the successes of the previous seasons.",1441152000,,426,4.930555555555555

3074767,5,B00123BY6S,"Amazing story. The first time I've seen anything on screen that feels as deep as a novel. Not as heart-warming and uplifting as The West Wing, but this is better told, more complex, tighter, deeper, grittier, and far more depressing: ""Dickensian,"" the creators might say. I appreciate this series expecting more from me as a viewer  no shots from previous shows to catch me up, and lots of little details that I enjoy because they resonate back through previous shows and previous seasons. I didn't cry along the way, nor was I moved, the way The West Wing affected me  but I cared about these characters, I mourned when bad things happened to them, and I worried for them when it seemed that they would. The world depicted in The Wire feels like the world as it is; The West Wing showed the world as it could be. I feel inspired by Jed Bartlett and his crew, but I believe in McNulty, Omar, and the kingpins and politicians and addicts and cops and lawyers and the rest of the folk that surround them.",1440979200,,1002,4.469945355191257

3074790,5,B00123BY6S,Well it was kinda sad watching this season knowing it was the last. This show was really great and it was a fun ride watching the series. In this season you have allot of the same continued stories from last season. Mcnulty is back and you also get to see the world of the newspaper and its involvement with the rest of the plot points in this season. I don't want to spoil anything but McNulty goes to some unique methods to get what he wants this season. I'd say its a pretty good ending to the series. There are a few characters that I would have like to see a different outcome but mostly this season wrapped it up well.,1440806400,2,624,4.1652892561983474
3074791,4,B00123BY6S,The last few episodes packed in too much; I don't know if it's the case but it seems like the plug was pulled on the show late in the game.

Great acting, good plots, and a birds eye view into the systems, how they overlap, similarities, and problems each system can cause for the other. In short, impedes progress and ability to do one's job.  Also proves in systems that it's who you know, and how well you ""rub elbows"" that gets you places.  May not be correct or fair, but that's the way life goes. Was impressed to look at a well organized ""system"" of drug distribution and dealing, and how sophisticated that system can be!!! Equals or rivals our legal systems!!!!!!

I cannot believe the outlandish story line and desperate attempts to make the show interesting.  The McNulty fake murderer story is so ridiculous and far fetched, watching it becomes more of a comedy than a serious, hard edged, police procedural that the first 4 seasons were.  Then, there is the Marlo killing everyone with impunity piece that becomes almost like a horror story, so implausible and random.  Worst of all is the journalism angle that focuses sadly on the dumb comedy of errors that develops when one loser journalist starts faking his reporting on the fake murders that are occurring.  The whole thing is a mess and loses the intensity and realism of the first four seasons.  No wonder the show ended after this season.",1436918400,2,831,4.736111111111111

3075093,5,B00123BY6S,"Serious, impactful, dramatic recreation of today's  inner city life. Accurately reflects our drug culture, the plight of most major cities and the governmental flaws faced by our law enforcement personal. The characters portray frustration, failure, and human flaws with realism and gritty emotion. The story line allows  viewers to associate with all sides of inner city life and the bureaucratic levels of corruption and ineptness in addressing the decline of our society and quality of life. This program does not sugar coat the growing epidemic of unemployment, drug use, and government corruption. It is refreshing and gripping to view ""real life"" and present truly realistic lifestyles while purposely not glamorizing drugs as so many other programs have done previously.
  Though shocking at times and ""in your face"" honest, it is worth the watch from the safe confines of your home. It allows the viewer to enter neighborhoods they would never dare venture into and view behind the door activities of our governmental bureaucrats to better understand the inner city life we only usually see on the nightly news.",1435276800,,1119,5.269662921348314

Television drama is most satisfying when  its creators think of it as serialized fiction with a plot arc and a beginning, a middle, and an end, instead of as a weekly event that needs to continue indefinitely, so of course it had to end, but I'm ready to start watching season 1 again.

The recent events in Baltimore and elsewhere, involving the lack of community-based policing, fights for K-12 funding, and reflexive white-cop-on-black-citizen violence, only make this series all the more important.

That said, season 5 was quite interesting as it focused on newspapers and politicians, as well as the police and people living in the bad drug neighborhoods.
Having watched the entire series when I now read the newspapers or listen to news I feel I know the back story, where everyone is trading favors and playing loose with the truth.  Just amazing.  I also have a deeper understanding of the inner cities and the desperation some children (and adults) feel with the dangerous circumstances they must deal with and the lack of real attention from the powers that be.",1432944000,,758,4.518248175182482

3075579,5,B00123BY6S,"I was late in watching this series - got the DVD's one at a time and recently started watching - and watching and watching ! It was so engrossing that I literally could not stop watching this incredible, true to life , gut wrenching series .
The writing is top notch , some of the best ever .  The characters are well-sketched and after five seasons you truly feel like you know them well .  The characters are multi-dimensional and it realistically portrays many of the "" bad guys"" , the gang members and drug dealers as pretty decent people with their own ethical code .Conversely , the cops aka the "" good guys "" are not all good - some are corrupt and unethical while many are driven  , honest and trying their best to clean up Baltimore - an insurmountable task .  I guess what I mean is that the writing in this show humanizes all the characters and is not stereoptypical at all . Many find Omar, who some may just view as a ruthless killer as one of the favorite characters on the show  - primarily because the characters are "" fleshed out "" and we come to know them more as just caricatures
 .  This show  is so gritty, raw and real  - it is particularly  relevant today with all the violence in Baltimore , Md .
I am shocked that it did not get the recognition it so well- deserved and only lasted five seasons . The acting is superb , the characters are so real and not just caricatures - you will become invested in their lives as if you know them well ,  believe me .
I only wish they would bring this series back and give it more exposure - I would be the first in line to watch this . I have highly recommened this show to family and friends and they all agree it is one of the ten best they tv series they have ever viewed if not  THE best !",1432425600,,1756,4.087463556851312

you laugh, cry, feel frightened and even mesmerized.......and I could go on. In the case of ""The Wire"", it's an elongated movie made for tv but
nevertheless a movie. This was one of the best of it's kind ever produced, directed, written and acted and was only sorry that it had to end. I've watched this series three times since it's inception and may look forward in the future to watch it again, it was that great. The only other series I have felt this way about is ""Deadwood.""

Tough to watch, almost heartbreaking at times ... I can't stop thinking about Duquan ""Dukie"" Weems in season 5.  My brother told me about ""the best show he has ever seen"" about 10 years ago. After watching the first season, I though that the WIRE is good, even great at timesbut not amazing; that was 10 years ago and both the times and we Americans have changed. Let season 1  sink in over some time and have patience since it builds up slowly. After re-discovering this series this year, you may feel as I have; catharsis, questioning the ""Good guys versus Bad guys"" over-simplifications, and quite frankly - asking what does ""criminal justice"" actually mean today ?

3075776,4,B00123BY6S,"After loving/cringing through the first 4 seasons. The last season delivers. I personally found it harder to get through. Partially from dreading the end of it and partially because the Wire is smart series that requires attention to get the most out of it. It is not a mindless sitcom, so you best not play on your cell phone or you will do a disservice to the story. Is it the best season? Honestly no, but it is still fantastic. Characters stay to who they are for better or worse. You do get closure and not a family eating dinner with your cable failing. So sit back. boil some crabs with old bay, and walk the streets of Baltimore one last time. Well, at least for us who are not part of the ""game"".",1429401600,,705,4.268656716417911

However, viewing the show is EXTREMELY frustrating.  The transmissions fails often.  It took us several days to watch one complete episode as we kept getting connection errors.  Each time we would verify that it was not our network failure  (as Netflix would still come in).  When and if we were given the ""Resume"" option, it would state that our connection time has ""timed out"" and we would be disconnected.

3075792,5,B00123BY6S,"It is difficult to know what to say about The Wire in as much as that it is like no crime show I've ever seen. For example, what it is not is a Law and Order, a pseudo realistic show that is really another cop story designed to make the American public feel secure in the knowledge that bad things do happen but in the end all will be well, perhaps with uncomfortable complications, but never the less. we're safe. All of the CSI nonsense does essentially the same thing. It's Sherlock Holmes on steroids, who by the way did the same thing for the English reading public in bygone times. Don't worry, superior humans will get the bad guys. The Wire has none of this. There is nothing reassuring about this show and it can be downright depressing at times, mainly because we sense the truth behind the story, that there are things going on in the underbelly of the American Dream that will not change and cannot be changed by Dick Tracy showing up in his white fedora. I can't say enough about the acting, where did they find these wonderful actors who seem so natural? And the writing is as true as true has ever been conveyed on any screen. This deserves more than 5 stars and I will make a point of watching it all over again sometime in the not so distant future.",1429315200,,1266,4.323529411764706

If the fourth season kind of slowed down the riveting thrill from the season two and three, this season put it back with a gripping story and brilliant analysis of the inner city political and social themes. The portrayal of the newspaper office is one of the most realistic and accurate I have ever seen, and this is coming from a journalism major.

I'm a stickler for that sort of thing. And I watched The Wire on HBO when it came out in it's original format. And I didn't even notice the difference. The show transforms to a 16:9 ratio very well without impacting the artistic quality of the series.

So don't hesitate to watch The Wire presented on Amazon in a widescreen format. The quality is great and you'll enjoy the show just as much (or more) than you did the first time you watched it.",1428019200,,691,4.2272727272727275

3075968,5,B00123BY6S,"Season five should peak your interest because it tells the future.  Who knew that the action in 2008 would fit the scenario now in 2015?  Recently, one of our most respected newscasters was removed from his job for fabricating a news story.  Music producers as well as singers, and authors on respected TV shows (Oprah) have been called out, ruined, or made to pay millions for their doings. We know the print medium is dying, so anything exciting seems to go.  But newscasters are supposed to be truth-tellers about what's happening in the world.  Unfortunately, season five shows us what a journalist seeking fame and fortune will sink to.  This guy blatantly creates news stories about the homeless, not realizing that the police (McNulty, who actually pretends to be homeless and talking to the reporter on the phone), as well as the actual editor of the Baltimore Sun, Mr. Haynes, are both on to him.  But what is the result of the lie?  No one listens, and the reporter gets  the Pulitzer.

Detective McNulty, Councilman Carcetti,as well as the unethical journalist all want to take on The Homeless as a cause.  But everybody does it, including academicians writing papers, etc., but they're still with us, and we see more and more of them coming out of wars.  So, what changes?  The police department doesn't change, although today people are looking at it more;  the drug culture flourishes in the hole and in the suburbs: homelessness abounds;  and The Wire asks the question:  Does anybody really care?  And they do it beautifully.",1426982400,,1541,4.842911877394636

3076043,5,B00123BY6S,I really enjoyed every season on The Wire. It is such a raw experience that doesn't always give you what you want but always gives you what is real. Season 5 was a great ending to an amazing series.,1426118400,,198,4.102564102564102

3076104,2,B00123BY6S,"Im from Baltimore and know many of the facts  and areas they used in this series, but this season was the worse. Each season dealt with corruption in each section . The streets , the waterfront  and  Unions , Politics , the schools and last the newspaper . I didn't like any of the Reporters and the Sun  was once a very good paper too bad it didn't go back some to show us when newspapers before the internet was a good source of news , but in my time they cut the Evening Sun an then cut all the good Writers to now its trash . The only good thing about the Baltimore Sun nowadays is on Sundays with coupons ! Also they lost they edge on the street, Season 4 was quite good , it shown why Urban Kids are what they are ( unless your from Baltimore or any big city you'll understand ) . Also that Mayor is based on the real Mayor at the time Martin O'Malley who indeed succeed being a Governor ( and a very bad one at that and is now running for President ) , O'Malley hated this  show because it shown Him as He was .Though many events in this series was based on true stories ( not sure about the entire waterfront story) and names were changed, but there was a real Omar .This season was weak , though was disappointed at the end with some characters direction of what happened to them , but anyone who lives in a big city knows there's out there an  many Marlos. Too bad the series didn't continue , when  corruption within the prisons was exposed and the Police force itself . 5 stars for the first 4 seasons an only 2 for this season.",1425513600,2,1540,4.0627062706270625

I have grown attached to these characters and want more.  To me the Wire is one of the best series on tv.  Coming in right up there with Southland.  I loved every heart stopping minute.  The last words of Snoop right before she knows she is going die is a good example of the way the writers think.  ""How's my hair look?""  The reply was even creepier from Michael- ""You look good, girl"" right before he blows her away.  Just indicative of the quality of the show.",1425168000,,617,4.241379310344827

When I was younger i remember there were mini-series like Shogun, Roots, Rich Man Poor man.  The Wire had similar qualities of those Mini-Series and it was a joy to watch.

3306018,5,B00123BY6S,"***EDIT NOTE (August 7th, 2008)***
I have learned from IGN that by the end of this year - early 2009 at the latest - all 5 seasons of THE WIRE will be released in a box set.  I will write a review once Amazon puts up an item for purchase.

If you want to go in fresh, then I suggest not reading any Season Five reviews.  But if you've already started, then read on.  I've done everything possible to avoid spoilers, yet critique from my own point of view.

***ORIGINAL REVIEW***
Typing reviews on TV seasons can be problematic.  If you're a newcomer to the series who just wants to know whether THE WIRE held up through all 60 episodes, the short answer is a resounding ""Yes!""  This series took big chances with each season, and each episode was carefully constructed and executed.  They don't call this show a ""visual novel"" for nothing.  THE WIRE is easily the most realistic TV series ever produced, and mastered the art of slow build-up.

But for those who missed out on Season Five, I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible.  If you're looking for a debate, go to IMDB --- you'll find plenty to fight about.

Trying to discuss plot threads and outlines of this Season would take an entire website, so let's split this up into the key players:

THE POLICE
---Season Five lets the Major Case Squad return to its roots as they track Marlo Stanfield, but the twist is that the entire police force is underpaid with morale at an all-time low.  Whatever happened to Baltimore's economy since last year has crippled the cops from doing good policework, let alone keep the stats at an acceptable level.  The few individuals who're motivated to work the cases, however, choose a shockingly unethcial approach.  This approach (which I don't want to give away) opens up the classic question: ""Do the ends justify the means?""  Some fans thought this scenario was unbelieveable, but I say there've been more elaborate methods of deceit in this country's history.  The police department's ethics and morals are really put through the ringer, this time.  You might have to take a grain of salt, but I think most viewers will grow to love the cops' creativity by the series' end.  Also, we finally get some closure on the past between Daniels & Burell, but in true WIRE fashion, we don't learn everything.  Overall, the threads involving Baltimore law enforcement worked very well, in my opinion.

THE POLITICS
---There is some sweet material here, even though it's basically two stories.  The first is Clay Davis's fate.  I couldn't have predicted any of the twists that followed, and still can't believe them after I think about it.  I'm very impressed that a minor colorful character really evolved into one of the Season's most memorable figures --- just when you think you've witnessed the climax, Davis's tale comes back with another layer.  Also in THE WIRE's political focus is Tommy Carcetti's ongoing struggle to balance his ambition and his civic duties.  These scenes were well-acted, but I was disappointed that nothing really changed within the offices.  I know that's the point of the story, but it only works for so many consecutive episodes.  However, I still think that Season Five portrays a good examination of general politics, warts and all.

THE STREETS
---Both my favorite and least favorite aspect of Season Five.  Marlo Stanfield and his crew lay low, and kinda toy with the cops a bit in the first episode.  ""The Game"" of the drug trade no longer has room for the idealists from seasons' past; this generation's players are more eager to violence and swift resolutions.  I'm glad THE WIRE never becomes a bloodbath, but I'm disappointed that such cold violence failed to grip me.  My problems with this part of the story were mainly because I didn't care enough about the dealers.  Marlo, Snoop, Partlow, Slim Charles, Cheese, and Prop Joe...the actors are all up to the task, but the story wasn't as brilliant as its predecesors.  Even the arcs involving teens Michael and Duquan didn't move me a lot, which surprising because they're such tragic characters; it's scary to think the real world is even harder on America's lower-class youth.  However, keep in my mind I'm disappointed by THE WIRE's standards --- these tough scenes surpass any other TV urban drama.  Where Season Five is at its best is with our everyman Bubbles.  Andre Royo's performance treads delicately between subtle and dramatic, and he's never been better in the role.  Bubbles represents every person in the world: if you give your attention to even the smallest person, a compelling story is waiting to come out.  Speaking of stories...

THE NEWSROOM
---Each season, THE WIRE reveals a new side of Baltimore.  For Season Five, we meet the press from inside the Baltimore Sun.  The editing room vibe is just as important as the characters who inhabit them.  Everyone from the greedy management to disillusioned veterans, and from ambitious journalists to a stoic editor jump on a hot story --- the only catch is that some of Baltimore's finest may not be so fine after all.  Clearly, David Simon (creator/writer) knows this field like the back of his hand.  Even if you didn't know he used to be a Baltimore Sun reporter, you'd swear Simon lived within this arena.  I think most of Season Five's detractors focused on this story arc.  My only real gripe is that the Sun's management isn't given enough depth: we've seen these bosses a million times before (they'll do anything for the greatest profit, or coverage, regardless of quality).  Like the Streets angle, the actors are pitch-perfect, but the story had a few more yards to go.  Still, conflicted journalism is always an interesting subject, and THE WIRE did an excellent job with it.

CLOSING THOUGHTS
---THE WIRE is a show we'll never get again.  The acting is flawless; what I mean is that no character dominates the show.  From start to finish, everyone on THE WIRE shares an equal prescence.  The writing is also superb, especially when watching on DVD.  How did we ever survive the week-by-week schedule?  THE WIRE is much stronger when you take it all in one sitting.

Sadly, Season Five is easily my least favorite for two reasons.
AND PLEASE STOP READING IF YOU WANT NOTHING SPOILED!

*  Each episode features a brief cameo from previous seasons' cast.  Cameos and guest appearances are fine, but very few of them contributed anything unique.  For example: Cutty gets a few brief scenes with Duquan.  Cutty basically tells the confused teen that he doesn't know what the world holds for us.  It's nice to see them interact, but the ideas are a bit recycled.  THE WIRE has always been able to give us little details without distracting from the big picture.  In Season Five, these cameos took me out of the moment.

*  But here is my biggest problem with Season Five:
First off, some fans didn't like how THE WIRE jumped from the streets to the docks, or how one year suddenly became about school children and not the police.  However, no one can deny THE WIRE was always tried to expand its horizons.  This is a fact.
Where Season Five slips up is that David Simon tries to resolve just about everything.  I always thought this show was stronger when some issues remained ambiguous, and when not every question was answered.  There was a sense of irony in each season's resolution.  But in THE WIRE's final act, Simon apparently couldn't let some questions go.  The Series Finale is superb, no doubt.  But Simon's attempt to connect everything together makes the world of Baltimore feel much smaller.

Maybe THE WIRE is about an interconnected world after all.

However, don't let my little nitpicks prevent any of you from watching this outstanding series' conclusion.
If you're a fan, you're gonna pick up Season Five anyway.
If you're a skeptic, have faith and spend the money.
If you're a newcomer to the series, I envy you.  Your first trip ""Way Down In The Hole"" is one you'll never forget.",1207180800,69,7956,4.767935578330893
3306019,5,B00123BY6S,"In all my years of watching TV, I can say without reservation that The Wire is the finest production ever brought to the small screen.  The measure of a good movie, play or TV show is rooted in the story telling and therefore the writing.  The Wire with its complex drawn characters has elevated the art of story telling to a level that surpasses what I thought to be the most important work ever produced on TV, Hill Street Blues.  I imagine that if Hill Street Blues had the advantages of The Wire (cable vs. network TV), it too would have provided the core realisim so evident in The Wire.

Kudos to HBO for bringing such a brilliant production to the screen.  This is a cable network that knows what it is doing (The Sapranos, Sex in the City, Six Feet Under, the list goes on and on).

The assembly of actors (none of which I had ever seen before, save for a few) was, in itself, casting at its zenith.  The direction, cinematography, second to none.  What was most impressive was the way in which characters were drawn.  Street dealers with a rudimentary code of honor (i.e., Sunday as the peace day among the gangs) and smarts normally not associated with this element.  Politicians who start out with the ""I want to do good and change the world"" idealisim and end up in the same space as all other politicians they started out dispising. The story of the docks and that of the schools and school kids we got to follow the last 2 seasons was as compelling a story as I have ever seen portrayed.  What was most impressive was the way in which the show ended its run.  No feel good endings (for the most part) where everything turns out right.  What you got was the truth; the cycle of the streets, the cycle of the docks, the cycle of the schools and school kids, the cycle of the politicians, the cycle of life which is just that; an unending cylcle of some good but mostly the same.

The Wire is the kind of TV that comes along once in a life time.  The critics got it, the award shows never did.  I suggest the subject matter was a little too gritty for their taste.  I implore anyone who reads this review and appreciates the finer elements of movie making to purchase all 5 seasons of The Wire as I have.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1207180800,24,2258,4.323040380047506

3306024,5,B00123BY6S,"The Wire (2002-2008) is excellent. It paved the way for an even better drug crime show, Breaking Bad (2008-2013).

Most people are aware of corporate espionage and what some companies will do to protect their secrets. In the TV show Breaking Bad the two main characters, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, and Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, possess the knowledge and skill to produce the best meth on the market. And their brand is easily identifiable by its unique blue color.

Several competing criminal organizations buy their services and try to replicate their product but Whites and Pinkmans skill in the art and science of making their blue meth product isn't easily duplicated. One group tries to hold Pinkman hostage in Mexico because their highly trained scientists cant make meth as well as he does. Near the end of the series another criminal group keeps Pinkman chained in their lab and force him to make meth for them because their guy, who worked with both White and Pinkman, is unable to duplicate Pinkmans and Walter Whites skill in the art and science of making their blue meth brand.

Breaking Bad has one of the best story and character arcs ever used in a TV show, which is why it has an IMDb rating of 9.5, right up there with Game of Thrones, another great show. The Wire (2002-2008) was as good as the Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014), but not as good as Breaking Bad. I won't give away the ending of Breaking Bad, but if you watch the complete series, from the first episode to the last, the ending will make complete sense and be very satisfying. Its terrific.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,2634,5.073903002309469

I love how the producers tied everything together and really tell the story of most big cities in America, from the drug dealers and ""hoppers"" to the police and it's chain of command; they even tied in politics, showing how dirty some will get to get where/what they want. I especially liked the last season, as they did a great job at bringing everything home and leaving all the characters on fairly good terms with the audience. I'm glad we got to see ""bubbs"" make it through his addiction and begin to lead a life of recuperation and happiness; in the same breath, I'm disappointed that ""dukie"" has taken an inevitable turn for the worse into drugs. Although in the beginning McNulty wasn't too pleasing of a character, by this last season I definitely took a liking to him. Because of his boldness and courage, along with Detective Freamon, they were able to take down Marlo and his crew and account for most of the crime and drug trafficking occurring in the neighborhood. I loved almost all the characters, however, my absolute favorite was Omar because of his wittiness and old school charisma. While most of his actions were downright despicable, you can't help but to think there's a lot of good in him. With that being said, it hurt me to my core to see him killed in S5, especially in the way in which it was done; if anything, that would be my only criticism.

3306053,5,B00123BY6S,"The Wire is a gritty and gripping detective drama, which is widely considered to be one of the all-time best shows in this genre, as well as being one of the greatest television programs ever made. It was created and primarily written by David Simon, the renowned author and former crime reporter, who, because of his background, was able to impart an uncanny sense of realism to the series. The Wire was set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland, and its story line centers around the organization and function of the criminal drug trade in Baltimore, and the tragic way in which it has ravaged the city, and its beleaguered residents. The Wire consists of a total of sixty episodes, spanning five seasons, with a different emphasis for each season. Although the multifaceted drug trade represents the overarching focus of this series, each individual season assesses the manner in which this criminal enterprise impacts a specific operational area of the city of Baltimore. The first season of The Wire examines the drug trade itself, the second season deals with the dysfunctional seaport system, the third season analyzes the corrupt city government and bureaucracy, the fourth season addresses the deteriorating school system, and the fifth and final season evaluates the unethical print news media. It brutally and realistically depicts the devastating effects that the criminal narcotic trade has had on the residents of inner city Baltimore, whose lives have been destroyed by the pervasive drug-related misery, despair, and hopelessness, which have now become endemic in this population. The Wire is characterized by insightful and brilliant writing, superb plot and character development, and absolutely spectacular acting performances, by its exceedingly talented ensemble cast. It definitely deserves the numerous awards and accolades which it has received over its five-year run.

The acting and the writing always make a great show and with all this ""Reality"" junk on today  ""The Wire "" is a home run. No commercials and you don't have to wait 6 months for the next season.

3306101,4,B00123BY6S,"The 5th and final season of The Wire wraps up the storylines of the previous seasons, not into a bow tie present (because a 'perfect', happy ending wouldn't be consistent with the show's history and overall tone), but in a satisfyingly disturbing way.  Lauded as the most 'realistic' crime drama, I will say it is one of the best.  I've seen SouthLAnd, The Shield, Low Winter Sun, Hannibal, Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, Dexter and the likes, and this is arguably in the top 3, with SOA & Dexter at the bottom and The Shield, Breaking Bad & The Wire fighting for the top contender.

It's a shame that the final season of this show only had 10 episodes, compared the last few seasons that got 12 or 13.  Because of this, it goes by a little quicker and it feels like there could've been at least 2 more episodes to show the repercussions of the actions in the final season, as well as give more characters a send off; however, some characters to pop up from previous seasons to show us where they've been or what happened to them.

One thing's for sure, this gritty crime drama pulls no punches, shows the most realistic, fake take on police, politics, the media, gangs, the public schools and the street life out there.  There is a liberal slant to the perspective, but it is very realistic nonetheless, and the raw emotion in the life-like appearance, character and power in the stories will resonate with anyone tied to law enforcement, criminal justice, EMS, urban life, or government sector.  As a police-affiliated worker, I can see a lot of the realities from this show in the real life individuals I interact with while at work. The Wire's not perfect, but it's close.  Many will say this or Breaking Bad are the best of the best. Watch the Wire, and you win either way.  Play with your life in the streets, and you lose either way: that's what The Wire teaches us.

***DVD note***

The version I got IS NOT the slim line, newer 2015 version that is described in the product description.

The newspaper storyline never really gets as exciting or dramatic as other subjects the series touched on over the years, but it does work with the main homeless murders story arc to bring new levels of absurdist entertainment to the last season.  It's probably the funniest season of the series, too.

3306266,5,B00123BY6S,"2004-2008 the David Simon, and Ed Burns returned to Baltimore, and produced this show to speak to the dysfunction in our cities.  The Wire depicts the complex interaction of heroin, broken families, street survival, lazy-ass police, money laundering, and the tribal politics that feeds-on and protects all of the above.  At the bottom, the street is a perpetual war, kids are soldiers, death comes quick, almost as a favor.  Look hard Humanists - human beings are fallen creatures, everybody, we'd rather screw, get high and kill than improve ourselves or our lot.  Only God has the answer to this.  America was built on His principles, it never worked entirely, mankind is incapable of following His plan, but the attempt was better than this.  Don't lie, respect your neighbor's property, respect life, respect your spouse, respect authority, let love into your heart, love God, and know there is only one God, and he is not that pile of cash, power, or the sex-object or substance that gets you off.",1482969600,,1002,4.934523809523809

3306421,5,B00123BY6S,"I loved the authenticity of the story. For years I worked in Philadelphia's worst areas for drugs, murder, and crime, and The Wire depicts an accurate description of the absolute cold-hearted, sociopathic ways of the streets.  People getting killed just on suspicion of something they ""might have said,"" or because the money or drug count was short.  It's a nasty, cruel way to live, but for so many, this is all they know. Children suffer greatly. Education suffers- police are corrupt, higher up officials are corrupt.  Money disappears into the government's deep pockets.  Families are torn apart and every community is affected.  It is like a pebble dropped in water. The poison all spreads out from the unfortunate losers who are the pebble, and who have so much power and street smarts that their layers may go so deep that their dirt may never be swept off the streets and it just keeps piling up. It becomes overwhelming at best.  If you want a realistic, well written, and superbly acted  police story- this is it. I laughed and I cried as I watched The Wire- I was disgusted and saddened at times, but cracking up at the humor and lifted up as well.  Loved it- just wish there were more of it!!",1479081600,14,1204,4.64622641509434

3306425,5,B00123BY6S,"Living in the Baltimore metro area and following the news - the Wire gives an excellent insight as to why the drug trade is prevalent and deadly in Baltimore city. The lawyers, police and politicians are all part of the problem along with the crushing poverty in the inner city, the bad schools, fatherless homes thanks to the government handouts of EBT cards, welfare, section 8 housing vouchers and healthcare keeps the women in the community dependent on the government. It's as if they're married to the government. In several episodes the series showed how they're not very parents and the system lets them get away with childish behavior even though it detrimental to the emotional and physical development of their kids.

Watching the wire and from my own observations and experience over the past 40 years I can now better understand how so many black youths end up in the drug trade and how hard it is for them to escape the environment they were born in.",1478908800,,964,4.738095238095238

This story tackled backroom deals in politics and the police force, how the good cops had to go through changes and deals to get their job done while the bad cops just do what they always do take advantage of their positions so they can move up the ladder  Drug dealing and how even little kids get caught up in the mess all for the sake of getting money...lack of parenting responsibilities..education of street & problem kids ..just pass them along to get them out of those teachers classes to the next ...corruption of longshore men getting involved with hoodlums for stolen goods, transporting foreign women for sex trade and even how high paid lawyers get drug dealers out from serving time...and more...One of the best if not the best urban series.",1476748800,,827,4.776223776223776

3306651,5,B00123BY6S,I'm sure I watched at least some of the series when it originally aired as I could remember bits and pieces of different episodes. My wife and I watched all 5 seasons during the last two months. We'd try and catch one or two episodes each night when we were free for TV watching. The first couple of seasons were outstanding. A cop friend from that area said the episodes were as close as you can get to the real thing. The street culture of the ghetto (if it is politically correct to use the term) was rather shocking to those of us who have led a sheltered life. Its easy to see why very few young people escape to a better life. The last 3 seasons were good. It was interesting to follow the various characters. Now too many of the residents made it alive to the end of the series. The value of life to these gangsters is shocking. It is easy to see why the carnage in Chicago is at the level it is this year. And in the end at the close of season 5 life on the street was the same as when the show started on season 1. Only the characters changed.,1475539200,,1052,4.0625

3306691,3,B00123BY6S,Not as good as the prior four seasons. This show tends to grab one main theme and run with it during the seasons with side stories to carry it through. I did not in particular enjoy this one as it circles the newspaper as the main story line. It could have ended better and some great characters were killed that I was rooting for. My final review is to watch this season to finish the series. Not many shows have great last seasons anymore and this is one of them....sad.,1475107200,,472,4.2555555555555555

I would (and have) recommended this show to others. As I was swept up into the story, I started getting close to characters which surprised me, Omar and Bubbles to be more specific. Yet I couldn't care less about what happened to McNulty. Again, the art at its best. If you do watch, give the show a chance. It takes a couple of episodes to get used to the language (lingo, not necessarily the cursing).",1473638400,,556,4.626262626262626

3306870,5,B00123BY6S,"Although Season Two, for me, still has the greatest resonance of all the years of the series, Season Five towers above almost all other tv shows. Season Five's additional focus, with governmental corruption and inefficiencies and, of course the drug trade, is on print journalism. At the time the season was filmed, print journalism hadn't yet entered the degree of the death spiral it's in now. The story line does include the declining fortunes of the Baltimore paper it focuses on. A central focus, ripped from headlines of that era, is on a reporter who fabricates the crux of his stories. A particularly inventive subplot - hats off to all of those at the writers table - has McNulty creating a fictitious series of serial murders. He does so in order to use some of the extra man hours allotted to the search for the nonexistent killer in his effort to bring down drug kingpin Marlo Stanfield. As with every season of this show, volumes could be written about all the plot elements and their links to actual events and the continuing tragedies that befall not only Baltimore but many of our inner cities. It's such a pleasure when that occasional show that examines the current state of the country succeeds.",1473033600,5,1214,4.758293838862559

3306969,5,B00123BY6S,"And this series doesnt. Ever.

Is this review even necessary? I suppose so, since everyones tastes are different. That said, in MY opinion(which is my own), The Wires the best tv show ever produced. Several others have come close, but this is, for me, as good as it gets. That said, season 5 to me is the 'weakest' of the 5 seasons and I'm giving it 5 stars. That's saying something. This show not just excellent, its CONSISTENTLY excellent. I did not watch this when it first came out. Hell I hadnt even HEARD of it when it first came out (probably because I didn't have HBO at the time).

When I found it? My entire extended weekend was spent watching. And I'm not a binge watcher by nature. I just could not get enough. That said, if you're looking at season 5, you've seen the other 4, and there's about 0% chance you will NOT pick up the last season even if I gave it 0 stars. I'd challenge anyone to watch the first 4 seasons and have no interest in seeing how the series ends. Not possible in my opinion.

So, in short(sort of)- get it, watch it, love it, rinse, repeat. Thats not sarcasm- I've watched this entire series probably seven times through and STILL would not be able to pass it up if I saw it on my channel lineup.",1470787200,,1233,4.260683760683761

3307058,5,B00123BY6S,"It is my view that 'The Wire' is one of the finest series ever produced for television.  It is gutsy, hard-hitting, and more accurate at every level than most would like to admit.  Season 5 is a first rate close to the series.  Good and Evil, the Merely Bad and the Dishonest flourish with aplomb.  The characters, even some of the truly evil ones, are extremely well drawn and in their own twisted way, sympathetic.  I have never seen a series that mirrored real life and a specific city so accurately....as recent history has proven.",1469404800,,535,4.589473684210526

3307164,5,B00123BY6S,"A friend who'd seen it before asked me how I thought it compared to Breaking Bad, and I lapsed into an extended pause. Both meet a standard few other crime dramas share. While The Wire isn't as stylized as Breaking Bad, its more expensive scope in plot and cast made it difficult to commit to or deny sympathies among the criminals or the cops. Very well thought out in its even-handed complexity.",1468540800,,397,4.527777777777778

3307228,5,B00123BY6S,"This show uses a lot of police jargon, street slang, and court room and does not explain it so you have to use context clues or look it up to completely understand. The 5th season started slow to me but then it got really good then it became amazing. This is a very well though out story and is a true work of art. You really need to pay attention to when they talk because things will happen off camera and will not make any sense if you do not remember what they were talking about earlier. The character development is very realistic and impressive. Some part were very boring to me, but as the show went on, I became more invested in the dialogue and the frequency at which I was bored decreased. The best part of this series in my opinion are the characters. You may grow to love and hate some of them. Even when you do not agree with them, you kind of hope things end up okay for them. If you like crime dramas in general, then this series is for you.",1467331200,,957,4.122994652406417

3307299,5,B00123BY6S,"This is a really good show, I'll admit some of season 5 was a little outlandish, but this is still one of the best shows i have ever seen. I gotta say...mini spoiler alert...they hinted at  the sexual orientation of one of the characters I think like 3 times, but it was completely unnecessary and didn't add anything to the character or the series. It was as if one of the writers lost a bet and had to see how many times he could get the viewers to say WTF was that and why did they think it was necessary? Still one of my favorite TV shows.",1466380800,,543,4.074766355140187

3307491,5,B00123BY6S,The entire series is fantastic but the opening part of season 5 is perhaps the best acting that I've ever seen in my life. Having work for a police department when I was younger it's very easy to assume that some of these young kids are just that stupid and are the victims of their own ignorance when dealing with the police and criminal situations. Everyone that I talk to you comes from the Baltimore area always tell similar stories that are expressed in the episode on The Wire. This is one show where you binge watch all 5 Seasons and it's like watching a Masterpiece Theater. The writing is simply brilliant and is able to capture the urban flavor of Baltimore perfectly. The only negative thing I can say is that there's only 5 Seasons and not more. But all good things must come to an end and this definitely is a good thing.,1465257600,,834,4.387096774193548

A cold and emotionless soul, with lifeless eyes and demeanor to match. Our four middle school boys are each off on a separate path to who knows where.
The Baltimore Police Department is giving it their best effort, but is it enough.  Crocked politicians and unethical lawyers add to the mix.

3307863,4,B00123BY6S,"It was a great show telling a story of survival  and struggle for everyday people that view life differently, but are the same in many ways. They seem to be different, but the lake (work) they fish out of brings them into conflict with each other. The web of deceit and corruption cross over into both worlds (justice-criminal). It's hard to gain control of a situation that is causing so much destruction in an environment or society when the solution or the corrective forces become a willing player in the problem.

Over all, great show with real  live and dramatic life telling issues that grip our society today.

The violence is extremely graphic and even more difficult to take are the reactions of non-nonchalance by the people who perpetrate it.  It is just the way they do business.  The white mayor and his black advisors fair no better as they make decisions based on what will benefit them politically without regard for the people of the city or people employed by the city.  The movie shows there is very little difference between black crime for control and white crime for control except that the white crime uses blackmail, bribery, and threats to get what they want.",1461801600,2,616,4.783018867924528

In literature circles, they used to say there were the Dostoevsky people and the Tolstoy people.  This one was definitely for the Dostoevsky people.  The terrible, the beautiful, and the funny, all tied into one.

While the series did ""juke the stats"" occasionally for pleasing a wider contemporary audience, this is not a serious criticism -  it has never stopped art from becoming timeless.  I predict this one ages well.",1461542400,,538,4.857142857142857

3308060,2,B00123BY6S,"This series built up to a giant let down.  Lots of promising character development and increasingly complex story lines lead to a final season of killing off the series's best character with no explanation, a boring side story of a dysfunctional newspaper, and a department cover up so unrealistic it's comical.

Each of the others seasons had well thought out plot lines and outstanding character arcs.  The police procedural was woven nicely into the story of Baltimore and each finale neatly wrapped everything up without rushing the narrative.  Not with this season...within the premier episode alone an entire story line is completely wiped out with no explanation, and the series ends with a very corny full circle mantra about how nothing ever really changes, having characters with very compelling narratives simply filling the shoes of characters from previous seasons.  Nothing is wrapped up, and at the same time nothing is left to the imagination.  The best characters in the series are either killed off or written out abruptly, and the season comes to an end with a friend's betraying McNulty's lie just shrugged off like it was no big deal.  Who wrote this garbage?  The newspaper side story as a parallel of the department was a snooze fest, and there was absolutely no reason to invest in any of the characters there, save for Gus, which was simply a placeholder instead of a dynamic piece of the story line.

I don't get into many TV series, but I was really enjoying this one...that is until season 5.  This was, without doubt, the worst series ender I have ever watched.  If everything was going to just the same as when the series began, then why watch anything at all?  Why introduce the notion that Leavy could finally burn like the scum he is only to turn the final showdown between him and Ronnie into a draw?  And what of Herc?  He becomes nothing but a sidekick to Leavy.....for what?  He nearly served no purpose except to advance a forced exposition.  Nothing in this series makes any sense.  Colvin had the chance to take a pop shot at the mayor....but nothing happens.  Why set any of this up if it was all just impotent?  This season had absolutely no point, other than to mark a official end to the series.

What a waste of time.",1461456000,2,2262,4.707379134860051

It stands out from other police series in its accurate jargon and a non-idealistic portrayal of the influence of politics in police work. It is nothing like the cliche filled TV police drama, nothing fancy about police work in Baltimore, and they are not afraid to let you see just that.  Terrific acting.  Just perfect.

The end scenes were fine, showing the cycle and how one bad guy is replaced by another... there's a new Omar, a new group running the corner, etc. The war on drugs seems futile.
Overall, The Wire was a good series. I just was really disappointed with season 5. McNulty was supposed to be that good cop with some bad habits but season 5 made me despise McNulty. I wanted him to go to jail. His character deviated too much, along with the fabricated storyline.",1459209600,,628,4.285714285714286

Very well done and I really enjoyed how they tied everything together and closed some of the story lines. Omar will always be one of my favorite t.v. characters, very well done on the actors part.

If you've stuck with this show long enough you will be rewarded by watching this season through to completion. Some old characters from seasons past make some brief appearances to remind you where they are now.

In addition, pay special attention to reporter Scott Templeton, viewers may think he is a farcical character, but he is not. As a former newspaper reporter, I worked with an editor with his kind of ethics. Once again, The Wire delivers.

Marlo is back and as dangerous as ever. The newspaper angle and the newsroom characters, lead by Clark Johnson, are as entertaining as the police characters. Irony abounds. It's hard not to root for even some of the bad guys - Omar, Proposition Joe, and Michael. Possibly the most well-written show ever on TV.

3308410,4,B00123BY6S,"Went on a binge with The Wire as I had not seen it in a long time and I'm not sure if I ever saw season 5.  McNulty has gone far over even his shady edge when he concocts a serial killer so that the mayor, Carcetti, desperate for some positive press, will funnel money to the police. Some of this money goes to Freaman in his on-going attempt to bring in Marlo. This season focuses on the roll of the press in helping McNulty pull off his scheme so there's a cast of half dozen reporters for The Sun.  So the typical triangle between police--city hall--and this time the press continues.  This is the last season, however, so there is a sense that the characters are taking their last laps as we see many who have become so familiar continue to develop--the end provides a very satisfying review of what seems to be going to happen to them now that we can't watch anymore.  A very satisfying conclusion to a great show.",1456617600,,919,4.294797687861272

So I suggest that maybe, just maybe you should just WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE. I mean, what is it with that word that it has to be repeated over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and again and again and again...How many times have you used ""please"" and ""thank-you"" and ""God bless you"" in a day, a week, in a year? I think this would be a great show...but, truly, I don't need that ""F"" word the way some of you do. So, I guess I will miss out.

I must warn that it is extremely vulgar and racist because the content requires it to be so.  Adults who want an inside look at gang politics, police and govt politics and how the 2 clash each day should see this series.  Although without giving too much up about the final season, it does try to bring closure to some of the issues from the first 4 seasons.  However I don't know how one can leave the series without the feeling that cities just will not be able to find a solution to the violence and death within the gang society. Sure I can say without a doubt that the destruction of the family structure..... easy divorce....lack of work income,... poor education by the school system .. DRUGS and DRUG MONEY.contribute to the on going structure survival and that structure is so strong it seems impossible for govt and authority to break.

3308525,5,B00123BY6S,"Season 5 of The Wire is the season that ties everything closed.  McNulty finally rams is head deep up his 6.  He goes too far - even for McNulty.

Over the past five seasons we've had the Barksdale's and Stringer Bell, Omar and Butchie, Prop Joe and the quoram, the Greek, the  Russians, the containers and the unions.  We've had Tommy Carcetti, Clay Davis, and many others. Cedric Daniels has risen from a dime a dozen Lieutenant to the Deputy Chief of Operations.  We've had fantastic writing from writers who seem truly proud of their work.

The Wire is a whirlwind of great television.  The characters are still week written it's as though we are introduced to a living family.

The Wire is not to be taken lightly.  This is absolutely great stuff.  Here are characters and situations we can believe in.  Here lies the best of the best.",1455580800,8,840,4.563758389261745

3308533,4,B00123BY6S,"Very few shows deserve a 5 star rating but ""The Wire"" comes close. This series is tense, dark, sadly pessimistic, well constructed and edited. It certainly presents a dim view of human beings in the contemporary failing big US city (eg, Chicago, now!). The 5th is a well constructed finale to a brilliant series, but uses a few contrived or exaggerated premises to achieve the less than optimistic conclusion. In this way it is not as successful as the first 4 seasons and almost borders on the frequent manipulation of plot one encounters in the good, but not great films and TV dramas.

Season 5 brings back McNulty as a full-blown alcoholic with none of his earlier screen presence, running a scam on ""the bosses"" with a fake serial killer.  There's a very shallow portrayal of a newsroom, with Omar coming back as some kind of superman.

  All of your favorite characters turn out to be just idols with feet of clay, and the worst characters of the series are allowed to remain around to ruin the credibility of the storylines.

3308574,5,B00123BY6S,"In all honesty this has to be one of the best shows ever on television.  The series has had it's ups and it's downs or should I say high points and lows, with the highs being as good as TV has ever been and the lows being really good TV but sub-par for this series.  Season 5 I would put right in the middle.  If you've watched the other 4 seasons you can see the end coming from a mile away when season 5 starts.  And that's probably the only reason I put season 5 in the middle.  I found myself not being enamored with the story line that set up the end of one of my favorite shows of all time.

Collectively this season was another expert and meticulous look at the inner workings of part of Baltimore's fabric.  This time it was the newspaper world.  But this is a look at newspapers like you've never seen on the screen.  You could just feel how real this was.  The characters were expertly written and perfectly portrayed. The issues they faced are real and not exaggerated for effect.

It was a sad moment hitting play on the last episode but all told it wrapped the series in quality fashion.  If you haven't watched this series don't start with season 5, please.  More likely you've watched the first 4 already if you're reading this so here is my ranking off the top of my head.  Season 1, Season 4, Season 5, Season 3 and then Season 2; ranked best to worst.  Like I said this is on The Wire scale, which most tv shows wouldn't even rate on.  Season 3 and 5 could easily be switched here for me.

In an ideal world, every fan-favorite character would've ended up better off and every criminal gotten his or her due, but this is Charm City. Murder police break the rules, politicians cut deals and hustlers dodge bullets or they don't. The added look into the Baltimore Sun started out slow but ultimately paid off.

3308688,4,B00123BY6S,"The Wire was a very well written and very well filmed series which I plan to watch (all 5 seasons) once again.  The concept for the series is that it is all connected.  The success of the drug trade is related to how well the police are able to function which is related to priorities and pressures the politicians are exerting and so on.  The episodes do not stand alone like an NCIS or Elementary but rather each one feeds into the next more like a Downton Abbey or 24 except, of course, The Wire is much grittier because much of it takes place in the rougher neighborhoods of Baltimore.  It's a great insight into the inner city challenges faced in all of our larger cities.  You really feel for the people trying to live in those neighborhoods and the people as well as the people who we rely on to make those neighborhoods safer.",1454198400,,834,4.354838709677419

The acting is adequate, Story lines are sharp and somewhat sophisticated, the actions of the cops are probably closer to reality than I would like however not one Miranda act read, cops taking testimony from alleged criminals without a lawyer being there being there. This type of realism gives people the wrong idea about your rights when dealing with the law.",1454198400,,430,4.904109589041096

Then again, the series appears to present the truth of the matter, e.g. the problem, but doesn't seem to suggest optimal solutions, which of course would do much to make this series even more relevant.

3308726,4,B00123BY6S,I've been binge watching this series since mid December when everything went into reruns and specials. I'm not sure why I didn't watch this show when it originally aired but I've enjoyed all 5 seasons. At the time of this review I'm only half way through season 5 (the final season) so not sure if the ending of the series will be satisfying. Each season the focus of the story changed while remaining true to the first season. So far season 5 seems to be the weakest season which may be why there were no more after season 5. In a nutshell it's a series about drug trafficking in Baltimore along with corrupt politicians and cops and some of the people that wanted to clean it up. Great series and worth watching.,1453680000,,714,4.416666666666667

3308731,5,B00123BY6S,"OK just saw all 5 seasons in about 30 days, luckily I can watch a series that way, no commercials, no long term drawn out time frame, I love to watch an entire series, you can call me a monogamous serial-ist. One series at a time, if its a good one, like The Wire, its the only way to go, as far as I am concerned, like learning a language through immersion. I am now immersed and fluent in this series.

I will give it a 98%. For Season 5, for the entire 5 season Series. It wiggles between a 92% and 100% episode to episode, but the overall average is stellar. Why? Because the show is consistently top shelf; consistently lacking in cliches, consistently dealing with moral ambiguity, heroic endeavoring, the counterpoint of local politics, local business, local police procedural, local education, local News reporting and writing, the poor, the rich,the lazy, the ambitious, the honest, the deceitful, the straightforward and the deceptive. The disciplined, the addicted, the gentle and the violent, the powerless and the powerful and the competitions between members of all these existing groups, and between rival groups, and between various aforementioned civic interests. Its about the law, the laws, the judges, organized crime, wiretapping, information gathering, and in fighting and backstabbing, and love,lust and murder, and money. Sounds like a far reaching show? Hell yeah, it is all over the place, but it rings true because it all seems to be about the same thing, everything is the same thing-temptation, greed, ego, honor, protection, teaming up, going rogue. Accountability, and betrayal.

Like a Shakespearean play, it ties together the many sides of the Human Condition in an ironic and artful expose on Human frailties, shortcomings and Heroic stands leading to the saving of people that are loved. I couldn't stop watching it, it moved me viscerally and intellectually and artistically,over and over, scene by scene. For me, it was a tremendous experience and an unforgettable 5 year show, all consumed in 30 days, wow. 98% is perhaps an unfairly low score, but I don't wish to seem blindly exuberant, and so I will leave it that. All performances were tremendous, there isn't a bad actor among the cast. The leading ensemble was superb. Bravo, Bravo, Bravo.",1453593600,5,2283,4.989501312335958

This is probably the BEST series I have ever watched.  I mean the writing was brilliant.  I laughed, cried, was angry, irritated and even disgusted by some of the characters and yet I couldn't help but love them.  It makes you think about how dysfunctional every sector is and how it deals with running any system.  It is so easy to give your own perspective, narrow as it always is.  This show just blew my mind.  I just can't say enough about the writing.",1451779200,,605,4.537037037037037

Season 5 focuses on the newspapers/media, but there's a lot more to it than that.  It's the final season, and the finale gives us a clue as to what happens to most of the characters in the future.

Please watch this show. Start at S1E1 and don't stop until the finale.  You'll be glad you watched it.  It's a drama, but there are plenty of funny scenes to lighten the mood.",1449792000,,447,4.402439024390244

I never really felt connected to any one character, except maybe for Omar. In the face of what his life was, he still had good character. The last season was my least favorite. I felt by brining in the newspaper side of things, being the last season, they didn't have enough time to develop it, and it felt sort of stacked on top. Too bad they didn't do it sooner. There isn't anything wrong with the series. The acting is top notch. The script language is excellent and authentic. It just never completely immersed me.  (Also, in one scene in I think Episode 9, you can see a dead guy in the coroner's place breath. lol He's was the black guy next to Omar.",1449100800,,777,4.25

In this last season we see how the frustrated cops who actually care about change are forced to resort to working around the system, breaking rules and placing themselves and their jobs in jeopardy in order to actually do some good.

Favorite characters:  Omar Little (Michael Kenneth Williams), Reginald ""Bubbles"" Cousins (Andre Royo); actually I loved them all, too many to name.  McNulty (Dominic West) was hard to like, manipulative, impulsive and selfish, but very well-acted.  One of his best scenes was when the FBI profiler was describing the (made-up) serial killer in Season 5, and it sounded exactly like McNulty (who made him up to get city money freed up for police overtime for real police work).  McNulty's look - recognizing himself in the description - was priceless.",1442275200,,716,5.129310344827586

3309208,3,B00123BY6S,"I think the brutality and the graphic violence ended up wearing me down by the 5th season.  But the stories and characters are still well developed.  However, by this season the inter-connection between different gang characters and their inner workings were just way too cumbersome to follow.  I lost track of who was putting a hit on who and why.  I simply did not care because it didn't really appear material to the subject of each episode.  I think it was over-done since every episode of this season had one gang killing another gang member.  If the season was intended to send a message of senseless violence, it succeeded.  But after a while, it became routine and loses it's punch.",1441843200,,690,4.7

major crime,  and abusive politics.  The conclusion that I reached about Baltimore was that after all is said and done the city was faced with the same old s__t and only the flies changed.  Nothing positive about outlook.

I don't know if that is true, but I certainly think it's up there. Not knowing who was going to survive from episode to episode kept me on the edge of my seat and as I got more invested in the characters as the series progressed I didn't want it to end, yet I felt it ended gracefully and was completely happy with it. Fantastic season and ending for a terrific show!",1441238400,,482,4.08421052631579
3309252,5,B00123BY6S,"For me, The Wire is the best tv show ever. That said,  the first time I watched season 5 I didn't find it as strong as the other seasons. This time, I think it as great as others. The difference is that they were having fun. All The Wire's clich are present and repeated: ""It's Baltimore"", ""Police work"" and the corners. Marlo Stanfield going to fight for a corner wearing suit was too much for me the first time, too easy, too clich. But now I think: they were saying goodbye to their characters and having fun!

It fails to live up to previous year (arguably, the greatest year of television in history) and feels like somewhat of a let down in comparison.

3309264,5,B00123BY6S,"Amazing story. The first time I've seen anything on screen that feels as deep as a novel. Not as heart-warming and uplifting as The West Wing, but this is better told, more complex, tighter, deeper, grittier, and far more depressing: ""Dickensian,"" the creators might say. I appreciate this series expecting more from me as a viewer  no shots from previous shows to catch me up, and lots of little details that I enjoy because they resonate back through previous shows and previous seasons. I didn't cry along the way, nor was I moved, the way The West Wing affected me  but I cared about these characters, I mourned when bad things happened to them, and I worried for them when it seemed that they would. The world depicted in The Wire feels like the world as it is; The West Wing showed the world as it could be. I feel inspired by Jed Bartlett and his crew, but I believe in McNulty, Omar, and the kingpins and politicians and addicts and cops and lawyers and the rest of the folk that surround them.",1440979200,,1002,4.469945355191257

3309287,5,B00123BY6S,Well it was kinda sad watching this season knowing it was the last. This show was really great and it was a fun ride watching the series. In this season you have allot of the same continued stories from last season. Mcnulty is back and you also get to see the world of the newspaper and its involvement with the rest of the plot points in this season. I don't want to spoil anything but McNulty goes to some unique methods to get what he wants this season. I'd say its a pretty good ending to the series. There are a few characters that I would have like to see a different outcome but mostly this season wrapped it up well.,1440806400,2,624,4.1652892561983474
3309288,4,B00123BY6S,The last few episodes packed in too much; I don't know if it's the case but it seems like the plug was pulled on the show late in the game.

Great acting, good plots, and a birds eye view into the systems, how they overlap, similarities, and problems each system can cause for the other. In short, impedes progress and ability to do one's job.  Also proves in systems that it's who you know, and how well you ""rub elbows"" that gets you places.  May not be correct or fair, but that's the way life goes. Was impressed to look at a well organized ""system"" of drug distribution and dealing, and how sophisticated that system can be!!! Equals or rivals our legal systems!!!!!!

I cannot believe the outlandish story line and desperate attempts to make the show interesting.  The McNulty fake murderer story is so ridiculous and far fetched, watching it becomes more of a comedy than a serious, hard edged, police procedural that the first 4 seasons were.  Then, there is the Marlo killing everyone with impunity piece that becomes almost like a horror story, so implausible and random.  Worst of all is the journalism angle that focuses sadly on the dumb comedy of errors that develops when one loser journalist starts faking his reporting on the fake murders that are occurring.  The whole thing is a mess and loses the intensity and realism of the first four seasons.  No wonder the show ended after this season.",1436918400,2,831,4.736111111111111

3309590,5,B00123BY6S,"Serious, impactful, dramatic recreation of today's  inner city life. Accurately reflects our drug culture, the plight of most major cities and the governmental flaws faced by our law enforcement personal. The characters portray frustration, failure, and human flaws with realism and gritty emotion. The story line allows  viewers to associate with all sides of inner city life and the bureaucratic levels of corruption and ineptness in addressing the decline of our society and quality of life. This program does not sugar coat the growing epidemic of unemployment, drug use, and government corruption. It is refreshing and gripping to view ""real life"" and present truly realistic lifestyles while purposely not glamorizing drugs as so many other programs have done previously.
  Though shocking at times and ""in your face"" honest, it is worth the watch from the safe confines of your home. It allows the viewer to enter neighborhoods they would never dare venture into and view behind the door activities of our governmental bureaucrats to better understand the inner city life we only usually see on the nightly news.",1435276800,,1119,5.269662921348314

Television drama is most satisfying when  its creators think of it as serialized fiction with a plot arc and a beginning, a middle, and an end, instead of as a weekly event that needs to continue indefinitely, so of course it had to end, but I'm ready to start watching season 1 again.  I will just say that I cried through the last three episodes.",1434499200,,531,4.343434343434343

The recent events in Baltimore and elsewhere, involving the lack of community-based policing, fights for K-12 funding, and reflexive white-cop-on-black-citizen violence, only make this series all the more important. It's great American literature, the equivalent of a classic novel about modern urban life.

Season 5 had some surprises and interesting turns. The skill of the youngest cast members continues to amaze. Several of them will surely and hopefully go far as actors. Season 5 had a few episodes that were not quite as taut as the previous ones, but the story lines wove through each other in a mostly episodic way although a few seemed to wander.  As a whole, the season was as rewarding to view as the rest!",1433030400,,546,4.505050505050505

That said, season 5 was quite interesting as it focused on newspapers and politicians, as well as the police and people living in the bad drug neighborhoods.
Having watched the entire series when I now read the newspapers or listen to news I feel I know the back story, where everyone is trading favors and playing loose with the truth.  Just amazing.  I also have a deeper understanding of the inner cities and the desperation some children (and adults) feel with the dangerous circumstances they must deal with and the lack of real attention from the powers that be.",1432944000,,758,4.518248175182482

3310076,5,B00123BY6S,"I was late in watching this series - got the DVD's one at a time and recently started watching - and watching and watching ! It was so engrossing that I literally could not stop watching this incredible, true to life , gut wrenching series .
The writing is top notch , some of the best ever .  The characters are well-sketched and after five seasons you truly feel like you know them well .  The characters are multi-dimensional and it realistically portrays many of the "" bad guys"" , the gang members and drug dealers as pretty decent people with their own ethical code .Conversely , the cops aka the "" good guys "" are not all good - some are corrupt and unethical while many are driven  , honest and trying their best to clean up Baltimore - an insurmountable task .  I guess what I mean is that the writing in this show humanizes all the characters and is not stereoptypical at all . Many find Omar, who some may just view as a ruthless killer as one of the favorite characters on the show  - primarily because the characters are "" fleshed out "" and we come to know them more as just caricatures
 .  This show  is so gritty, raw and real  - it is particularly  relevant today with all the violence in Baltimore , Md .
I am shocked that it did not get the recognition it so well- deserved and only lasted five seasons . The acting is superb , the characters are so real and not just caricatures - you will become invested in their lives as if you know them well ,  believe me .
I only wish they would bring this series back and give it more exposure - I would be the first in line to watch this . I have highly recommened this show to family and friends and they all agree it is one of the ten best they tv series they have ever viewed if not  THE best !",1432425600,,1756,4.087463556851312

nevertheless a movie. This was one of the best of it's kind ever produced, directed, written and acted and was only sorry that it had to end. I've watched this series three times since it's inception and may look forward in the future to watch it again, it was that great. The only other series I have felt this way about is ""Deadwood.""

3310178,5,B00123BY6S,"Despite being a fan of HBO programming for years, I had never made it past the first season of The Wire. I thought the first season was solid and the second was a letdown.

After years of hearing how great it was an wondering what all of the fuss about, I decided to give it a binge. If you make it past the 2nd season your reward will be some of the best stuff to ever be put on television. Period. Make it past season 2 and you'll thank me.",1430956800,,442,3.911111111111111

Tough to watch, almost heartbreaking at times ... I can't stop thinking about Duquan ""Dukie"" Weems in season 5.  My brother told me about ""the best show he has ever seen"" about 10 years ago. After watching the first season, I though that the WIRE is good, even great at timesbut not amazing; that was 10 years ago and both the times and we Americans have changed. Let season 1  sink in over some time and have patience since it builds up slowly. After re-discovering this series this year, you may feel as I have; catharsis, questioning the ""Good guys versus Bad guys"" over-simplifications, and quite frankly - asking what does ""criminal justice"" actually mean today ?

Each of the show's five seasons focuses on some aspect of life in the Charm City -- drug crime, unions and the waterfront, the schools, local media, etc. -- with the police and criminal justice system as the common thread connecting it all. Those who spout simplistic solutions and slogans to address the issues facing the city should be required to watch this amazing series.

3310273,4,B00123BY6S,"After loving/cringing through the first 4 seasons. The last season delivers. I personally found it harder to get through. Partially from dreading the end of it and partially because the Wire is smart series that requires attention to get the most out of it. It is not a mindless sitcom, so you best not play on your cell phone or you will do a disservice to the story. Is it the best season? Honestly no, but it is still fantastic. Characters stay to who they are for better or worse. You do get closure and not a family eating dinner with your cable failing. So sit back. boil some crabs with old bay, and walk the streets of Baltimore one last time. Well, at least for us who are not part of the ""game"".",1429401600,,705,4.268656716417911

However, viewing the show is EXTREMELY frustrating.  The transmissions fails often.  It took us several days to watch one complete episode as we kept getting connection errors.  Each time we would verify that it was not our network failure  (as Netflix would still come in).  When and if we were given the ""Resume"" option, it would state that our connection time has ""timed out"" and we would be disconnected.

For example, what it is not is a Law and Order, a pseudo realistic show that is really another cop story designed to make the American public feel secure in the knowledge that bad things do happen but in the end all will be well, perhaps with uncomfortable complications, but never the less. we're safe. All of the CSI nonsense does essentially the same thing. It's Sherlock Holmes on steroids, who by the way did the same thing for the English reading public in bygone times. Don't worry, superior humans will get the bad guys. The Wire has none of this. There is nothing reassuring about this show and it can be downright depressing at times, mainly because we sense the truth behind the story, that there are things going on in the underbelly of the American Dream that will not change and cannot be changed by Dick Tracy showing up in his white fedora. I can't say enough about the acting, where did they find these wonderful actors who seem so natural? And the writing is as true as true has ever been conveyed on any screen. This deserves more than 5 stars and I will make a point of watching it all over again sometime in the not so distant future.",1429315200,,1266,4.323529411764706

I'm a stickler for that sort of thing. And I watched The Wire on HBO when it came out in it's original format. And I didn't even notice the difference. The show transforms to a 16:9 ratio very well without impacting the artistic quality of the series.

3310465,5,B00123BY6S,"Season five should peak your interest because it tells the future.  Who knew that the action in 2008 would fit the scenario now in 2015?  Recently, one of our most respected newscasters was removed from his job for fabricating a news story.  Music producers as well as singers, and authors on respected TV shows (Oprah) have been called out, ruined, or made to pay millions for their doings. We know the print medium is dying, so anything exciting seems to go.  But newscasters are supposed to be truth-tellers about what's happening in the world.  Unfortunately, season five shows us what a journalist seeking fame and fortune will sink to.  This guy blatantly creates news stories about the homeless, not realizing that the police (McNulty, who actually pretends to be homeless and talking to the reporter on the phone), as well as the actual editor of the Baltimore Sun, Mr. Haynes, are both on to him.  But what is the result of the lie?  No one listens, and the reporter gets  the Pulitzer.

Detective McNulty, Councilman Carcetti,as well as the unethical journalist all want to take on The Homeless as a cause.  But everybody does it, including academicians writing papers, etc., but they're still with us, and we see more and more of them coming out of wars.  So, what changes?  The police department doesn't change, although today people are looking at it more;  the drug culture flourishes in the hole and in the suburbs: homelessness abounds;  and The Wire asks the question:  Does anybody really care?  And they do it beautifully.",1426982400,,1541,4.842911877394636

3310601,2,B00123BY6S,"Im from Baltimore and know many of the facts  and areas they used in this series, but this season was the worse. Each season dealt with corruption in each section . The streets , the waterfront  and  Unions , Politics , the schools and last the newspaper . I didn't like any of the Reporters and the Sun  was once a very good paper too bad it didn't go back some to show us when newspapers before the internet was a good source of news , but in my time they cut the Evening Sun an then cut all the good Writers to now its trash . The only good thing about the Baltimore Sun nowadays is on Sundays with coupons ! Also they lost they edge on the street, Season 4 was quite good , it shown why Urban Kids are what they are ( unless your from Baltimore or any big city you'll understand ) . Also that Mayor is based on the real Mayor at the time Martin O'Malley who indeed succeed being a Governor ( and a very bad one at that and is now running for President ) , O'Malley hated this  show because it shown Him as He was .Though many events in this series was based on true stories ( not sure about the entire waterfront story) and names were changed, but there was a real Omar .This season was weak , though was disappointed at the end with some characters direction of what happened to them , but anyone who lives in a big city knows there's out there an  many Marlos. Too bad the series didn't continue , when  corruption within the prisons was exposed and the Police force itself . 5 stars for the first 4 seasons an only 2 for this season.",1425513600,2,1540,4.0627062706270625

I have grown attached to these characters and want more.  To me the Wire is one of the best series on tv.  Coming in right up there with Southland.  I loved every heart stopping minute.  The last words of Snoop right before she knows she is going die is a good example of the way the writers think.  ""How's my hair look?""  The reply was even creepier from Michael- ""You look good, girl"" right before he blows her away.  Just indicative of the quality of the show.",1425168000,,617,4.241379310344827

3310673,5,B00123BY6S,"I really liked this series.  I was looking for a well written series that I could enjoy.  One that would develop characters and plots over time.  When I was younger i remember there were mini-series like Shogun, Roots, Rich Man Poor man.  The Wire had similar qualities of those Mini-Series and it was a joy to watch.  The added bonus was watching it on Amazon Prime, with its On Demand schedule and no commercials.  I""ll admit I did miss out on some sleep time, but it was worth it.",1424476800,,483,4.370786516853933

3310679,4,B00123BY6S,This is a very entertaining series and I'm currently on the final season.  I'd give it five stars if it weren't for the newspaper and politician episodes.

8243658,5,B00123BY6S,"This show is one of the most honest and well-acted pieces of art that ever was on television. It still holds power today, even years after its production. The acting and lines are brilliant, the character building in depth, and the story is a truthful and thoughtful reflection on the corruption within the government, police department and media that is still very present today. It shows how good guys become bad guys and bad guys become good guys. It is one of the only shows I've watched to truly show the connection of corruption that is pervasive at all levels in society instead of just pointing fingers at easy targets.",1523836800,,627,4.709090909090909
