1737125,4,B00006ADFO,"This movie is about a guy who gets his heart broken by an ex-girlfriend. It leads to him coming to the conclusion to give up sex for Lent...40 days and 40 nights. No sex (even the Clinton kind), no kissing, no touching, and no playing when you're lonely (if you catch my drift) for 40 days.
He does fine for awhile, but day 25ish-he becomes agitated and the lack of being intimate either with a woman or with himself is getting to him.
He meets a gal, she doesn't know it the situation at first but later finds out-upset because he wasn't honest but later comes around and is supportive.
Does he make it the 40 days? You're just going to have to watch it for yourself...
I rate this 3.5 stars to 4 stars, as I thought it would be funnier but it is quite funny as it is. I would say this movie is surely NOT recommended for younger children and use discretion when you think about bringing (a) child(ren) to watch this flick...",1014508800,7,926,4.267045454545454

1737222,1,B00006ADFO,"This film should be unequivocally banned for its depiction of rape.

Imagine a storyline in a rom-com where a woman is trying to get over an ex-boyfriend and falls in love with a new guy, but doesn't want to have sex with him for the time being. Now imagine that this woman - during the final act of the film - is tied down on her bed, drugged and raped by the ex-boyfriend. She then has to tearfully run after the new guy who is angry at her for being raped and she is forced to apologise for being unfaithful. Only then can she get the new guy.

1737292,4,B00006ADFO,"Keegan Connor Tracy (who played the Blue Fairy from ABC's TV series Once Upon a Time) lead me to this film. Thank you Keegan. 40 Days and 40 Nights is a really good romantic comedy about Matt Sullivan (Josh Hartnett) taking the vow of 40 Days and 40 Nights without sex or anything involving sex after a breakup that happened 6 months ago. Things were going great for him until he met a special girl who came into her life, Erica Sutton (Shannyn Sossamon). That's how they both fell in love and started dating. But he couldn't kiss her or have sex with her because he still was taking the vow. The film gets better and funnier when all his friends and co-workers were placing bets and how long they think Matt can go without sex. Some bet he'll make it while others don't think he's gonna go through with this. Also, it was hilarious and at the same time very very very exotic to see these women co-workers of his try to seduce him to make him crack, lose it, and see if he breaks his own vow. However, Matty boy still stayed strong and kept going days and days without sex until he reached Day 40. That's basically the plot of the film. Now listen. Don't listen to the professional critics who gave 40 Days and 40 Nights negative reviews. It was a really great movie. The motion picture had moments that were funny and moments where they felt you can relate to. It shows how men and women can think sometimes when it comes to sex. As a guy myself, I know there's no way a guy can go 40 days without sex or any form of it. As for women, seduction is their ""power"". But guys like me could resist them (most of them). LMAO. The point is.... go see this film. Rent it or buy it. Don't care if it's an old flick from 2002. Go watch it with your friends. You and your buddies may have some laughs about it. Plus, I really love the chemistry and connection that Harnett and Sossamon's characters made in the film. It felt so real. It was really sweet and romantic. That's why it's a romantic comedy. I really feel this film is underrated. It deserves so much more credit than this. It's really enjoyable that I felt like watching it again a few more times. I haven't any movie multiple times since 2007. By the way, some women may take offense to this film. It depends. So if you have any female friends who are curious and want to watch a film like this, give them a warning. Anyway, final verdict is a 9/10. It may not be one of the best movies in the world, but it's good to kill some time on your hands.",1405987200,3,2500,4.221294363256785
1737293,5,B00006ADFO,"When I saw this movie the first time I was blown away, seeing myself in his character so much!  I was so grateful and respectful that someone in the screenwriting profession was able to actually capture exactly what goes on in a young man's mind when he's healthy, eager about life and has all sorts of hormones coarsing thru his body all day long and nowhere to put that driving, pent-up sexual energy.  Especially since if you were a Catholic and you were not married, it was a sin to do anything about it AT ALL - alone or with someone - and you could face varying degrees of eternal damnation if you did.  His hallucinations near the end of the 40 days about the fully dressed women around him suddenly not being so felt incredibly real to me, I have been there!

1737349,3,B00006ADFO,I have to admit I didn't see this film the way some of these reviews' authors saw it. I thought it was relatively funny.

1737350,1,B00006ADFO,"What an awful movie. It had an interesting premise that I was eager to enjoy; however the plot was terrible, the characters unlikable, and the rape was ridiculous. Who the hell makes a movie with such horrible people and expects people to like it? The best friend was trash and I was hoping somebody would actually be on Matt's side in all this but no, even Erica the girl he liked was a bitch to him. In the end the movie was just a crude excuse to make sex jokes and went over the top with the rape of the hero who is too stupid to even know he's been violated. What piece of trash! Did I mention there is a rape?",1346630400,2,615,4.049180327868853
1737351,1,B00006ADFO,"This is one terribly-dull movie. I had a slight-chuckle somewhere, but the rest of the film was so bland that I truthfully can't even remember it.

It's contains nothing but attempts at sex-related humour with the occasional nudity. Matt (Josh Hartnett) is an overly-aroused guy who gets with woman after woman. Because of his loss of an ex-girlfriend, he eventually decided that celibacy is something he should try and see if that helps him forget her somehow. So, for 40 days and nights, he vows to have no sex -- including masturbation. He puts away all of his porno stash (doesn't get rid of it, though) and tries to focus on other activities. It's working well for a while. Yet his buddies think he's going insane because a man just doesn't do what he's trying to do and are betting that he won't last. The even set up a website to track it all and women are trying to trick Matt to give-in so they can win the money.

He meets Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) in the laundromat and seems to genuinely like her for who she is. Yet she's fully-boring and is a perfect match for Hartnett's character since she seems to only want sex, too. However, he wants to wait because his vow was important to him. The characters are horrible together. Now, if there really was a story and any character development, and he really wanted to change his ways, he should be searching for someone who was not seeking sex right away. This is just a brainless sex 'comedy', though, so what takes place in it is to be expected.

SPOILERS: It ends with Matt being cuffed by both wrists to his bed by his roommate who then leaves with a girl for the evening. Why that happened, I'm not fully sure, but he told his buddy to leave the door to the apartment ajar so that Erica could get in at midnight. That's when the vow's time would be over and he was going to make-it with her. Well, the ex shows up earlier and has sex with Matt who apparently was able to sleep through it all (riiiigght). If he really was that out-of-it, she would have been guilty of raping the man. Many of the reviews says here that the ex raped him, but it doesn't seem like that. Matt wasn't fighting anything, wasn't drugged, was enjoying it and knew what was happening. It was a few minutes before the end of the final day, so he lost his vow of celibacy. That ex evidently won a lot of money since everyone was betting that Matt wouldn't make it all the way and she placed the final bet.

Erica shows up and meets with the ex who's leaving Matt's apartment. Erica finds Matt handcuffed to the bed, hears him say that he was asleep...while he THEN proceeds to admit that he thought it was her that he was having relations with. He didn't look at all to see who was there? Stupid! Eventually, she doesn't care and forgives him after he gives some lame apologies (which show again that he knew he was having sex with his ex)...he and her have sex for the first time and are in the bedroom for a day or more...and nobody in the audience really cares. Did his celibacy mean anything? Is he now going to be a one-woman-man? We don't know and it's pointless. Also, it's lame, like in most any movie and in life, when folks meet and are having sex after they know nothing about each other.

Here's a worthless, unfunny, insulting-to-men flick which has a core-idea that 'all men only think about sex all the time and it's the only thing they feel a woman is good for'. A guy who's like that isn't a respectable man at all but just a lustful jerk.

I just saw this for the heck of it today on a VHS tape that I bought years ago somewhere for maybe 50c. I can't believe the sticker on it was $12.99 and that someone spent that amount on this pre-viewed dreck at BLOCKBUSTER back in the day. Ugh. I just chucked this thing in the garbage tonight and, in-line with the Biblical title, it'll be returning to dust (though that will take much-longer than 40 days and nights). If someone was able to actually watch that take place, it would be worse than this film -- and that's the only 'positive' thing I could say about this.",1346544000,,4064,4.354881266490765

1737354,4,B00006ADFO,"I had never seen this movie before and Everyone kept telling me it was a classic and that I needed to get it ASAP...I have 100's of DVD's in my collection so I thought what the heck I can sure use another one.  I got it and it was actually pretty good.

The plot surrounds Josh Hartnett's Character who is basically just fed up with all of the one night stands he has been having lately (I know that is nuts right :P )...He is also trying to get over his ex girlfriend who just so happens to be getting married to someone else.  Seems as though she has gotten over him.  So in order to regain control over the woman in his life and in order to regain control of his own sexual life he decided to take a vow of abstinence!!!! YES I SAID ABSTINENCE!!!! Now everything is wonderful in the beginning but then things get a little weird.  He meets a girl who is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of his Ex Girlfriend and he actually starts to fall for her.  He wants to have sex with her but he can't because of the Vow.  And on top of all of that there is a friendly wager going on at his office with the date that he decides to give up as the center focus.  So while he is trying to refrain from sex all of his insanely sexy co-workers are trying to get him to give up so that they can win the very high jackpot from the bet.  It will have you laughing all the way up until the very end and it is a truly tasteful mix of comedy and romance :) I think any couple or just anyone who is bored will love this movie and I would recommend that you pick one up today while there are still some in stock :)

And I would also ask that if you found this review helpful in your decision to purchase this item that you could click the button and let me know.  It really does mean a lot to me to know that you guys think I wrote a good review and to know that it helped you in your decision so if you could just click the button and let me know It would mean A lot to me :) Thanks again friend",1287964800,,1964,3.8972431077694236
1737355,2,B00006ADFO,"Ok, I'm going to be VERY honest here.  The only reason I sat through this entire film was because, after seeing her in `A Knights Tale', I became obsessed with Shannyn Sossamon.  She is nearly the perfect woman (OMG she is so hot) and so I'd watch her in anything.  This film is sadly beneath her.  The script is rather nonsensical (but most of these teen sex comedies are), but what makes it worse is that it doesn't really deliver on the `stupid funny' side of things either.  I actually found most of this film rather ridiculous to the point where it was irritating.  The concept of the film had promise, and it does at times make a point with regard to the differences between male and female interpretations of their own sexual needs, but overall the film remains very low-brow and somewhat ignorant of it's own message.  This film just serves as an excuse for horny guys to make a lot of sex jokes and wantonly look at barely clothed (sometimes not clothed at all) women.  Hey, I'm all for that as long as the film is funny.  This one isn't.  It isn't funny and it isn't smart.  Hartnett has talent and I have always liked him as an actor, so he sold me on his character despite the many holes presented by the script.  Still, the only reason to see this is for Sossamon.  She is breathtaking, spunky and just entirely edible.  This movie would have been far more believable had Hartnett has his way with her in the Laundromat.",1284508800,2,1433,4.419847328244275
1737376,3,B00006ADFO,"For ill-sorted and unbelievable reasons I made a vow that I wouldn't write another review for Amazon.com for forty days and forty nights, and for awhile I stuck to it, but eventually like all guys my hands started unconsciously to head south for the keyboard and here I am.

40 Days and 40 Nights is set here in San Francisco, so I give it three stars just for that, and director Michael Lehmann (who is from here) knows just the right corners and hills from which to sprinkle the film with an unusual beauty of texture.  Though some of it must have been filmed in Vancouver or somewhere, for parts of it just rubbed me the wrong way (sorry).  In any case you all know the story how spurned by cruel, selfish Nicole (Vinessa Shaw), our hero Josh Hartnett decides to lay off all sex, even sex with himself, and all would have been fine except that he is surrounded by the biggest pig pack of friends I've ever seen in a movie, led by Paulo Costanzo who seems to be channelling Nixon here, Nixon at his most Machiavellian.  These friends make life miserable for Josh and I for one was appalled he didn't slam the door on all of them once his ordeals were finished.  With friends like Paulo Costanzo, who needs enemies?  Well, the movie just isn't as interesting as it thinks it is, and the sweat pouring from Josh's temples suggest a level of suffering that might have worked in Schindler's List (he fantasizes himself as Christ tempted in the desert, and a visual cue shows him as Christ crucified).  If it weren't so heavy-handed it might have been fun to watch him run the obstacle race to happiness, but I don't know, somewhere along the way it lost its fire.

San Francisco also has more people of color than this film suggests--way more.  And it has people in it older than 29, even working people.  Here everyone is white and works for web companies who also hire a token Asian here and there.  It's bizarre.  The best thing in the movie is its stars, and even that has to be qualified by saying that for Josh Hartnett and Shannyn Sossamon, 40 Days and 40 Nights represented the peak of their careers, and everything they've done has been a disappointment commercially and critically since.  But here they are utterly gorgeous and likeable and the chemistry between them rocks the screen.  Wonder what happened?  Couldn't Hollywood find anything worthwhile for either of them to do?",1281225600,,2387,4.557377049180328
1737377,1,B00006ADFO,"Josh Hartnett plays the male lead Matt, in this ""movie"". Hartnett's other roles are quite variegated and some of his greatest roles are in Lucky Number Slevin, Sin City, Black Hawk Down and The Virgin Suicides. The female lead in this movie is Erica, played by Shannyn Sossaman, most noted for ""A Knight's Tale"", but has also been seen in One Missed Call and Rules of Attraction. Josh Hartnett's character makes a para-religious vow to abstain for 40 days and 40 nights from all sexual activity to get his ex-girlfriend Nicole out of his system. He, of course, meets Erica in the middle of his vow and has real trouble keeping his vow as they fall for each other.

There is little good to be said about this movie. It does have a few larfs, it has a couple of jerky, gratuitous shots of naked breasts. Its soundtrack is modern and kinda catchy. Overall, how this got a R rating, I'll never know. This is strictly PG13 fare.

This movie is disguised appeal to abstinence and prudery. It has some objectionable material. An anti-arabic phrase is used, a the female lead has a stupid conversation with her roommate ""He's treating me with consideration, like an equal."" ""Kinda sucks, doesn't it?"" ""Yeah, it sucks."" WTF? I'm not uber-feminist, but the entire movie seemed to be a religious, pro-abstinence, idiotic farce. It had some thinly veiled misogynistic messages, although they were against society's grain of misogyny. It's humor was strained and threadbare. It lacked any real insight into people or relationships. It had a catholic priest making out with a nun. What purpose did that scene really serve? This movie presupposes that everyone is an idiot. I really am left without much comprehensible to say. A big disappointment for the careers of Hartnett and Sossaman.

Pointless.
Absurd.
Borderline Offensive.
Juvenile.

That about sums it up.

In related news, Maggie Gyllenhaal, an excellent actress, played a lackluster supporting role in this movie. She shined as best as she could, but got mired in the absurd script.

I had this DVD sitting around and felt recently encouraged due to the enormous success with ""chick movies"" I felt with ""He's just not that into you"". Which is an actual movie, not a piece of crap hiding in a genre. This movie's a big pass.

Less funny and only moderately more interesting than its followup, 40 Days and Nights is best for its depiction of San Francisco during the dot-com bubble/era. The bagel guy, the fashion/look/etc, the open work spaces, the ubiquitous sense of entitlement, the casual throwing around of money, the constant rediscovery of the internet's expanding reach, the frantic sexual-ization of almost everything for short term gain - I can't help but wonder if someone on the film spent time with my initial employer :)

As a film experience, its a lightweight - no character is more than mildly compelling and ultimately it never breaks through the surface of funny or interesting - which is disappointing because the setting was both in spades.

If you're intrigued by the delightful ridiculosity of the dot-com bubble culture, I recommend this film - otherwise, it's a pass.",1246579200,,1197,6.155688622754491

1737380,3,B00006ADFO,"Matt (Josh Hartnett) has just gone through a rough break up with his girlfriend Nicole and is flying through new girls to try and help his pain. To his dismay though, no amount of sex can get Nicole out of his head. A little later he finds out that his ex is now getting married to a guy she barely even knew for 2 weeks. Matt snaps and tries to get help from his brother who is just about to become a priest. Matt then comes to the conclusion to give up sex and any other kind of sexual pleasure for lent. 40 Days and 40 Nights of pure abstinence.

Of course once he begins his trek of the impossible, he happens across a pretty and interesting girl named Erica (the ever so beautiful Shannyn Sossamon). He doesn't want to tell her about his vow because it's kind of embarrassing and also because he doesn't want to seem weird. Don't worry though because of course she's going to find out since all of his friends have created a pot luck to guess what day he's going to, get some relief. Oh...and they've also posted it on the internet for everyone in the world to bet on also. As the days and nights go by, Matt keeps getting tempted more and more from not just his new girl, but from workmates, friends, and even complete strangers just drinking some coffee.

40 Days and 40 Nights feels a lot like a `wannabe' Judd Apatow movie, but just not as funny (if you're into Apatow's movies that is). And I really do think it's because of the love angle in the movie. I think if it hadn't been for that, this could've been a lot funnier. But hey, that's just my opinion. There are still some pretty funny moments in the movie, but I just think it could've been better.

In the end, I would give it a rent. It might even be a fun date movie (maybe not a first date movie for some...hehe). I had a good time with it.

P.S. When this movie first came out it related SOMEWHAT to an experience I had just a few months earlier, so of course I thought it was pretty funny at the time. I had gone overseas in Oct of 2001 for 9/11. I went over to help set up an air base, but I only had to be over there for a month and a half. So basically, yeah... I did go without...well... anything for about the same time as Matt did. And yeah, there was some pain and anguish, but it wasn't nearly as bad as he had it at the end with the shakes and twitches and all. But I will say it was pretty painful and I swear some of the things he'd see (like when he was on the bus or in the coffee shop) were things I was seeing. What a happy reunion I had with the girl I was seeing at the time when I got home...hehe.",1236038400,,2587,4.046875

He attempts to fill the void left in his life by having a series of unfulfulling one night stands. While talking to his brother, who is training to become a priest, he decides to take drastic action. Prompted by the arrival of Lent and also the realization that Nicole is recently engaged Matt decides to give up sex for 40 days and 40 nights. He isn't limiting it to intercourse any foreplay or self gratification is also off limits. No one close to him including his roommate, brother, or co workers believe he can go through with it and begin taking bets for how long he will last.

The two begin an awkward romance with Erica left confused about why Matt isn't putting the moves on her. He doesn't tell her about the vow but eventually she finds out and is not happy about it. The film only works thanks to the beautiful Sossamon. Hartnett is good in their scenes together  but on his own he doesn't fare as well. The supporting cast is good with Griffin Dunne as Hartnett's boss who is miserable because he too isn't getting any, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Sossamon's sassy roommate. Otherwise the film is a standard teen sex comedy that isn't real funny and that ends terribly. The director Michael Lehmann directed the great Heathers but hasn't directed a funny movie since.

1737438,1,B00006ADFO,"...how dumb movies can get. Then again, maybe I was stupid to expect a spark of intelligence in this film. Just to give you fair warning, Matt (the main character) is the only mildly pleasant person in this entire film. Matt decides to get rid of sex for Lent because of a bad break-up. In his endeavor, he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life.

Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?)

However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she?

Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from?

Normally I'm not this scathing in my reviews, but this film is the lowest of the low in intelligence and very high in crudeness. Not recommended",1154217600,6,2697,4.431451612903226
1737439,3,B00006ADFO,"Someone else wrote something about recalling their personal experiences that this movie conjured up for them. Well, in a similar but different way, I have to admit that I did the opposite and actually imitated the movie...or at least the general premise of it. Granted the scenes and subplots were somewhat outlandish and contrived, but this was an overall inspiring movie for me at a time when I too was looking for meaning in what was then a very unmeaningful phase in my life.

Without coming off like some kind of wannabe player, I will just say that I had enough casual experiences with beautiful women to realize that this was not a way to fill in the void that only true love could render--yeah, you know what's right but you take a few wrong turns to actually get why it is, ya mean? (that's Brooklyn for, ""do you understand what I am saying?"")LOL

Anyway, a year ago, I did the 40/40 fast and I must say that situations that might have been considered for alternate scenes for this movie definitely began to happen to me, especially from the African-American male point of view (lol). I avoided situations that I would later want to slap myself for not engaging in (e.g. why did the most beautiful woman in the entire club, whom every man seemed to be after, decide to just randomly sit by me and why did she try to molest me on the dancefloor, later on, when I explained to her when she asked why I was purposely keeping my distance from her heavenly-sculpted body (sometimes I get migraines thinking about how much resistance I had to put up that night). 40 days/nights is definitely not an impossible feat, but when women can just seem to sense that you are doing something to resist them sexually...wow...just evil! It can really become a serious challenge, especially if you were as social as I was--hell, I'm a musician and was also an Entertainment writer back then--got me?! LOL

So, I guess the movie got to me because I related to it on a very personal level and learned a lot about myself, women, and increased willpower in the process.

As far as standout scenes in the movie...man...you gotta love the ""white orchid"" scene where Matt and Erica attempt physical intimacy while still playing by the his rules and not actually touching each other (LESSON: Foreplay gives equal or greater pleasure than sex for a lot of women).

His roommate was hilarious as his antagonist and the reason everyone all over the city seemed to know about his fast and was betting on him.

The ""Bagel Guy"" was a great character and great for running jokes (i.e. his name and that he knows everybody's business).

Nicole was definitely hot and I know for a fact that Matt's run-in with her when she came by his place and he resisted her (which only made her hornier) is not contrived! Cold showers don't do squat...a long brisk walk (even running...away, quickly) really helps!

His hot female co-workers testing him on two occasions to bend his will and break him...brings back memories!

Erica would definitely be a challenge to resist, considering she was sexy, cool, and a prime reason for Matt to engage in sex again, but this time in a monogamous, fulfilling relationship; and for the ladies reading, they're a good number of men out there that actually would prefer that...and don't live with their mother, aren't psycho, and actually have a life and are attractive (lol) ;)

Overall, this movie is a good buy if you fall into the American Pie age demographic but aren't opposed to a pro-monogamous message...even if it isn't the most serious or realistic one. And if you try to do the 40/40 fast...don't commit to something you can't finish!!

Now I'm in a monogamous, reciprocally-loving relationship with my girlfriend who represents the type of woman I need to be with that I can share myself with sexually in a spiritually-fulfilling way...but why, in all irony, is SHE a virgin??? LOL",1147132800,4,3895,4.68814055636896
1737440,3,B00006ADFO,"I picked up this movie just wanting some raunchy humor and some lite entertainment, but was absolutely positively shocked at an eerie parallel that it showed in my own life.  Years ago I was going out with the Matt character, who had a girlfriend (quite a while before he met me) named Nicole who dumped him, walked away and never spoke to him again.  I am not so vain and self centered to think that I was the ""girl of his dreams"", but I think I am a damned good woman.  He would not, could not stop talking about her.  He still sent her presents and letters, and told her that he would always be there for her.  When I asked him why he was doing this (he never kept it a secret from me), he said it was his duty to look after her and keep her safe even though everthing was returned to him unopened.  He was a deeply religious man who took the ""No sex for Lent"" to apply to all days of the year, and he spent many days and nights in extreme sexual frustration.  Finally, unable to commit to me after a year of whining codependence, sexual absenance, and being absolutely positively determined that someday somehow Nicole would come back to him, he broke it off to become a priest.  About a year later he married another woman who wasn't Nicole.  No really.

This movie brings out a lot of things that are otherwise typical male fantasy and frustration.  Matt, the main character, is devistated that the old girlfriend Nicole broke up with him, and has decided the only way to get it out of his system is to abstain from sex for Lent.  He will not just not sleep with other women, but abstain from all aspects (porn, masterbation, etc.).  This is no easy feat for a man, as men are hardwired to think about nothing but sex at every waking moment.  The hilarity ensues with his friends taking bets on how long he can last, suddenly all women around him looking hotter, and all the sexual reference one can imagine.  He, naturally, meets the girl of his dreams and cannot break his promise until after said 40 days are over.  She gets annoyed, he gets insane, and it all works out in the end.

I don't really know where I stand on this, except it was just an eerie coincidence as to something that happened to me in real life.  It struck me as being very self centered or maybe insecure of Matt to not tell his new girlfriend about this.  Had I been in her position I would have been as sympathetic as possible.  But Matt was at least likable and did not spend every waking moment whining to his friends and aquaintence ""Oh whoa is me, Nicole left me"".  Unlike some people.  He had a purpose, and did not lie to himself about his feelings or wants.  The rest of the movie is just filler, filled with smutty references and sex jokes that unfortunately sends this movie into the ""it's just ok"" field.

I guess the biggest question here is if Matt emerged as a stronger, wiser person because of this choice.  To me, I didn't see it that way.  He seemed the same, except that he had successfully moved on from his old girlfriend to a new one.  He didn't earn the admiration of his friends who knew about it, instead they shook their heads and laughed at him behind his back.  And the new girlfriend didn't seem any different either, except she must have been glad they didn't have to wait anymore.  And of course, for me, I wondered where this all lead to the real people that this movie unknowingly imitated.  The ""Matt"" and ""Nicole"" real people are most likely still married to their spouses, the real ""Matt"" has probably conveniently forgotten about all these things from my perspective.  As the viewing audience, I can't help but feel bitter and hurt by it.  But that's the past.  I was the one who emerged the stronger from this experience.  I am no longer weak and eager to make others happy, I am strong.  And because I am strong, I met a wonderful man with who I am happy with who doesn't need a mother.",1139443200,3,3906,4.3406896551724135

  In the film 40 Days and 40 Nights, no sex is Kryptonite to Josh Hartnett's character, Matt because he cannot go through a day without thinking of sex and it ruins his social life by not being able to talk to girls without having sex on his mind. He strongly wants to follow through with his promise to himself by staying pure for the entire 40 days and nights.

It's not something that he is capable of doing and they all have faith that he will fail.

Each day matt tries to do something constructive that helps him no think about sex, such as model car building and doing laundry. In the work place, Matt's co-workers start a bet to see which day he will break. It later turned into an online betting all over the internet. Prior to all of this he's been on a sex binge because of his girlfriend left him to dry. It's been the only thing that he knows and helps cope with the pain he's suffering.  Matt starts to go through sex withdraw and everything he sees turns into some sexy act in his mind.

  He then meets a girl while doing this laundry one day. Easily there's an attraction but knowing that he cannot have contact with any female physically, he keeps to himself and doesn't say a word to her. As time goes on Matt starts to talk to her and makes a date with her. The date goes wonderful but instilled in his mind is that he can't have any sexual acts with this woman. She finds this weird and at her work place she came upon the website with the online bets. This made things very difficult for him and her. She starts to lose interest in him when he tells her the truth about what he can't do. This is the first time he's felt this way for a woman other than his ex-girlfriend. He truly falls for her and this time he didn't have to have sex. In his mind he wants to get her back so bad but he has that promise to himself that he feels is more important. Now the movie becomes the typical love story where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, then boy will get her back.

 In anybody's point of view 40 Days and nights is torture to a character like Matt. Since he's such a lady's man and is extremely sex dependent. Many people know that 40 days isn't that much but to him it feels like an eternity.",1134518400,3,2792,4.163568773234201

After his girlfriend Nicole leaves him, Matt spends about six months devouring girls, until he starts to hallucinate. Advised by his brother, Matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems, and proposes to go through lent without sex.

For Matt's friends, this odyssey is as absurd as impossible, and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last Matt's abstinence. He doesn't have it easy, as many temptations will make him suffer, and even smell the possibility of a new love.

40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character. In a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years, this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love.

So, the story is about a man named Matt (Josh Hartnett), who decides to stay celibate for 40 days of Lent after a brutal breakup (he was know as a kind of 'ladies man' before). But then, he meets a girl of his dream, Erica (Shannyn Sossamon), and can't do nothing about it. Besides that, his co-workers make a bet, when he'll brake. So, he must stay celibate for 40 days, with a lot of pressure from his co-workers, but he must also prove his love for Erica. So the happy ending follows.

1737478,4,B00006ADFO,"Yes, this film is very contrived, somewhat offensive/vulgar, and pretty formulaic in the ""romantic comedy"" genre...but for me, despite those flaws, what makes this film better than I expected are the great scenes of San Francisco and the unique beauty of Shannyn Sossamon.  I absolutely love her in this film...her look, her performance, her character...she is definitely my ideal woman (if there are any real women out there who resemble her).  I always thought it would be a cool thing to meet the love of your life in a laundromat, and this film has that scene in there.  Another thing I think is cool is riding the city bus all over the city as you observe the people on the bus, the route it takes, and the fresh perspective you get seeing a part of the city you might otherwise not see.  That was in there too.  San Francisco was the perfect city to set this film in and is very much a star of this film in its own right.

I like the offbeat side characters, like the bicycle courier, who is typical of the ones I've met.  He was funny in nearly all of his scenes, so that added a lot to making this film better than its premise.  Now, about that premise...it just seems a bit overdone that Matt (Josh Hartnett) would go nearly crazy abstaining from sex for a mere 40 days.  I was in basic training for 9 weeks with 70 other guys in the company and no one went crazy from the lack of sexual opportunity.  Let's face it, Matt is probably a sex addict who should've checked into Betty Ford Clinic for 40 days.  Alas, he didn't, so we have the comedic antics as he attempts to keep his vow despite temptation rearing its ugly head in many different ways, from women on the street to advertisements to his co-workers' pranks as the office pool moneypot grows with bets taken on when he will break his vow.  I found it amusing that his female co-workers confronted Matt about taking the one power women have over men away from them by his vow of abstinence.  Its funny that so many people in the film seemed to take his vow personally, as if he made it for them instead of for himself.

This film probably has the most unique love scene I've ever seen in a film, as Matt manages to keep his abstinence vow while bringing extreme sensual pleasure to Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) with the use of flower petals (I'm not kidding--it has to be seen to be believed, but even then people might want to try that trick at home to see how genuine that could actually be).  Unfortunately, like all romantic comedies, there has to be an exposure of the truth that causes one of them to flee the relationship and the inevitable groveling to win back one's true love.  Somehow, it didn't ring true for me in this film.  Like I said, this film is poorly contrived and is only saved because of some of its humourous scenes, the great scenes of San Francisco sites, and mostly because of the presence of Shannyn Sossamon who is an actress I hope to see in more movies, of higher quality.  She has a very unique look and style that I find lacking in many other actresses of our generation.  She had a small role in ""A Knight's Tale"", so this film she has more screen time, next will be to find a better film/script for her acting talent and presence.",1101945600,2,3229,4.3785594639865995

1737482,3,B00006ADFO,"If irony is indeed the master trope of the universe, as I have been claiming for several decades, then you know that as soon as Matt Sullivan (Josh Hartnett) makes a vow to stay celibate for the ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" of Lent, that he is going to meet the love of his life.  That would be Erica Sutton (Shannyn Sossamon), who fate throws him together with at the local laundry mat.  Matt knows that he is being tested.  The problem is that pretty much everyone he knows is in on the cosmic joke.
Matt takes his vow because his breakup with Nicole (Vinessa Shaw) has left him a wreck.  He keeps bailing out on successful dates and is becoming obsessed with ceilings.  He goes for comfort and advice from his brother who is studying to be a priest and practicing hearing confessions.  When he sees the banners for Lent going up he takes it as a sign and swears off sex, including foreplay and self-gratification.  Unfortunately, once his roommate Ryan (Paulo Costanzo) finds out the deals this becomes the prefect opportunity to use the internet to get a pool going on how long Matt can, uh, last.
Now, for the sake of argument we will assume that Matt has no discernable brain activity when he is asleep (despite scenes to the contrary), so that we can have the willing suspension of disbelief to go with the film's running gag that has the hero falling part as he goes longer and longer without relief.  In the real world this guy would be able to keep his vow and wake up without any major problems.  But writer Rob Perez and director Michael Lehmann (""The Truth About Cats & Dogs"") want to milk this guy's discomfort for everything it is worth and, unfortunately, more.
It dawned on me that this movie has is clearly bifurcated into the ""guy"" parts and the ""girl"" parts and the biggest problem with ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is that the two halves do not fit together (as compared to ""50 First Dates,"" which overcomes a similar problem and combines comedy and sweetness).  Matt's friends and co-workers treat his vow as a joke and/or money making opportunity.  This allows for lots of jokes and some prosthetic humor that leads to the inevitable conclusion that all men are pigs.
Where this film had potential was with the idea that Matt would have to date a woman without having sex, both before and after she finds out about THE VOW.  However, I find it hard to believe that finding out about such a thing would really be upsetting to a woman, especially if the guy knows how to handle a flower (and Matt really knows how to handle a flower; this film must have given lots of couples ideas for similar epsiodes of flower fun).  But if you stop and think about it the idea that a couple could have a good time on a date with sex or any form of physical contact has to be against just about everything Hollywood stands for (assuming, of course, they are in an upright position).
I was planning on liking this 2002 comedy more, but then somebody bad does something really bad without consequences.  No comeuppance.  No joke at their expense.  No sense of outraged expressed by another character.  Nothing.  I was so ticked off by that turn of events that when the film cobbled together the requisite happy ending I was not really in the mood to enjoy it.  But the filmmakers do get props for coming up with a nice little gift as Matt's final act of contrition.

The movie is fitfully funny. The acting is fine, considering the script contortions the players are asked to deal with.

To me, it seemed like the person who wrote the script was not the same person who conceived it and began the project. Considering that this is a comedy-""romance"" marketed at teenagers, the plot is actually rather interesting. There are some good ideas, and occasionally the movie has a burst of humor.
But then the rest of it is so chock-full of stupid ideas that I'm not sure what happened. It seems like any part of the script that attempted to say, ""Hey... sex ISN'T everything"" was erased and replaced by a lame joke.
I give it 3 stars because some parts of it were actually funny, it is an interesting premise, and because the acting is actually all pretty good - even Josh Hartnett, of whom I'm always suspicious.
But the way it switches it's message back and forth is irritating, and it seems to cheapen the point of the movie. Matt is supposed to be falling in love, yet they never seem to make a point of explaining what love is - in fact, the one time when they try to explain how Matt and Erica are in love is simply this: Erica can have an orgasm without Matt touching her.
My biggest complaint, though, out of all of this... is that Erica is quite easily the absolute least understanding girlfriend character in the history of cinema. It seems like Matt can't do anything without her considering it an insult. The worst example of this is
(Spoiler alert)
when Matt is practically raped and Erica finds him in the aftermath, still bound to a bed. Instead of being sympathetic in the least, she accuses him of cheating and then storms away, leading to Matt's solemn attempts to ask for forgiveness.
VIOLENT CONTENT - None.
SEX/NUDITY CONTENT - Plenty. Toward the end, Matt has visions of naked breasts everywhere, and since the premise of the movie involves sex you can expect that there's a lot of talk about it. Like, say, the entire screenplay.
LANGUAGE CONTENT - Pretty standard R-rated movie cursing.",1062028800,9,2025,4.581267217630854
1737524,3,B00006ADFO,"A Film by Michael Lehmann
After breaking up with his girlfriend, Matt (Josh Hartnett) decides (after talking to his brother, who is going to become a priest) that he is going to give up something for Lent: Sex.  Matt will give up sex for the 40 days and 40 nights of Lent.  He's not just giving up sex, he's going to give up all forms of sexual intimacy.  No kissing, no groping, nothing.  I don't know about anyone else, but that doesn't seem like much of a premise to me.  40 days is only a month, a week, and a couple of days.  That's not very long to go without sex.  Naturally, by the end of the movie Matt is about to turn into a quivering, raging lunatic....all from not having sex for 40 days.
Be that as it may, I'll talk about the movie instead.  There are some funny moments, and there are some sweet moments, but as a whole, the movie did not quite live up to the expectation that I had for being funny.  We're not talking Oscar standard here, but this movie fell short (pun intended) of being good.  Early on during his 40 days of abstinence Matt is doing laundry on a friday night.  He meets Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) there and they start talking and begin a friendship.  They start dating, but nothing intimate.  Matt even freaks out and pulls back at an almost kiss.
At the same time this is going on, at Matt's office his co-workers are having a betting pool on how long he can hold out from sex.  This spreads from a simple office pool to a web page about sex and Matt's sexual hiatus.  Did I mention that Erica's job is to search the internet for pornographic websites so that the sites can be blocked with software?  Naturally she discovers the site, freaks out, and this causes a rift between Matt and Erica.  For some reason, when they started getting closer, Matt couldn't tell Erica that he didn't want to have sex or even kiss in the first 40 days they knew each other.  Right.
The movie wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good.  It was somewhat funny, maybe amusing is the better word.  I would not recommend it to buy, maybe to rent.",1061510400,,2056,4.3046875

He's a religious kind of guy with the dubious-distinction of cooling things off with his (hormones) and his love-life with the ladies. Anyway, he gets with a Catholic Preist, dissussing with him the delicate-subject of ""celibacy"", on doing away with sex for 40 days and 40 nights, as a part of the [Catholic Church's] ""Lent Celebration.""

But The romantisisim between Matt and Erica fades into the 2nd-half of the movie with Matt's ulterior-motives to putting-off having sex with her. Little does she know, that Matt can't have sex for 40 days/nights. There are so many bare-breasted women in this movie, that makes it feel like your watching a porn-flick. (I thought it was totally unessecary.) All I have to say, is this movie comes-up way short. I loved watching the sparks-fly bettween the two - the truth of the matter is - that this movie was funny at the start (in the 1st-half) but lost some steam in the 2nd-half.

1737541,1,B00006ADFO,"40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS is yet another addition to the teen sex comedy cannon- although its billed as ""the first  no-sex comedy"".  And hopefully the last. The difference with this movie is that it's neither sexy or funny. It's just downright embarresssing and almost unwatchable.
Following breaking up with his girlfriend Matt Sullivan (Josh Harnett) decided promiscuity was  the way to ease his pain, but for some reason he chooses to go further and give up sex for 40 days and 40 nights (Why?): No touching, no kissing, no nibbling, no foreplay, no fooling around, no self gratification (NOT EVEN THAT?! Crikey, you'd go mad!). But during his period of abstinence Matt meets the girl of his dreams, which makes things harder for him (literally as well as figuratively). It's harder for the viewer to sit through this movie. I think another reason for the movie's title could be that trying to watch it the movie seems to last 40 days and 40 nights instead of 100 minutes. Just awful.
Who keeps letting movies like this get made? I can just imagine some greasy exec pitching this movie: ""Now here's my idea: This kid decides to give up sex for forty days and forty nights, okay? This is also the movie's title, right? 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS. But during that time he meets the girl of his dreams, but he can't have sex with her, right? Becuz..."" Then the studio boss screams, ""Brilliant! You're a genius! Get me that kid from PEARL HARBOUR...""

While the exterior shots of San Francisco are lovely, the interiors are some Hollywood designer's idea of what San Francisco looks like--not at all convincing.

His roommate puts up a website and takes bets on how long Matt will last.  He then meets Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) and they immediately fall in love.  This love is threatened by Matt's vow of celibacy.  It sounds like an interesting and perhaps funny plot line, and I will say that I did laugh a few times watching the film, but at the end I found it to be a crude and distasteful view of sex and women in general.  Instead of saying what I believe they meant to do in making the film, that there is more to relationships than sex, they wound up giving, in graphic detail, the depths to which men will go to pleasure themselves.  In any case, Josh Hartnett and Shannyn Sossamon both gave excellent performances and the chemistry between them was interesting to see, but unless you are into movies based solely on sex jokes and bad sex, I would stay clear of this film.",1041206400,3,1243,4.440528634361233

Sure, it is kind of a silly movie, and yes, it sort of sets reality just off to the side, but come on, it is not meant to be taken seriously.
Matt (Jose Hartnett) is a twenty-something guy who works for a web design company and is having trouble coming to terms with being dumped by his girlfriend.  It gets so bad that he starts to hallucinate when he is with other women.  So in a moment of divine inspiration he decides he will give up sex (even the alone kind) for lent, 40 days and 40 nights.  Shortly therafter in a chance encounter at a laundry mat he meets a girl named Erica (Shannyn Soosamon) who he finds irresistible.  The burning (maybe literally) question is can he keep his vow?  The odds aren't in his favor.
This plot makes for some great situation comedy.  Hartnett does his best to play it straight.  I raised a brow at his choice for this role, but he pulls it off.  Paulo Costanzo is hillarious as Matt's roommate and the voice of promiscuity.  The director handles the whole film with a tongue-in-cheek stlye that fits the situation.
Is this film for everyone?  Probably not.  I am a twenty-something so maybe I just get it.  Anyone looking for the American Pie, Road Trip kind of comedy should enjoy 40 Days and 40 Nights.  Good stuff.",1033516800,2,1468,4.365313653136531
1737612,3,B00006ADFO,"It was bound to happen.  Josh Hartnett became a very hot property after ""Pearl Harbor"" so it was inevitable that he would get the lead in a romantic comedy.  Unfortunately, it isn't a very good one.  The screenplay is a typically sex-obsessed teen flick with twenty-something characters.

Matt (Hartnett) is trying to get over his ex-girlfriend Nicole (Vinessa Shaw) by having sex with every woman he meets.  When it dawns on him that this is superficial and fraught with anxiety, he decides to give up sex for lent.  Of course, as soon as he makes ""The Vow"", he meets his dream girl Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) and he spends much of the ensuing time trying to come up with reasons not to have sex with her.  Meanwhile, his co-workers and half the internet have a pool on what day he will give in.  The comedy is mostly puerile, though there are a few funny lines sprinkled here and there.
Director Michael Lehmann has plenty of experience with vacuous comedy, having directed ""Heathers"" and ""Airheads"".  He has done better on TV with ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and ""The West Wing"".  Lehmann keeps it light, but the material is just too jejune for him to do much.  To his credit, the cast seemed to be having fun with it.
Josh Hartnett is an excellent dramatic actor.  However, as a buffoon he is just not that funny.  His true skills emerge in the romantic scenes with Shannyn Sossamon where his sincerity shines through.  Hartnett and Sossamon have terrific chemistry.  There is a very sensitive and endearing quality about their scenes together.  Sossamon is a bright young talent who might do well with the right scripts.  She is lovely and engaging with good acting ability.  Paul Costanzo provides much of the best comedy as Matt's sexually fixated roommate.
This isn't a terrible comedy, but it is rather immature considering the age of the characters and the target audience.  I rated it a 6/10.",1033430400,4,1898,4.7317073170731705

I haven't seen Josh Hartnett in Pearl Harbor so I cannot say how good an actor he is. But by judging in this film, he's just an average.  He sometimes reminds me of Sylvester Stallone when he speaks.  As for Shannyn Sossamon, she's not outstanding either. Nothing in this film required her or allowed her to show off her acting skills.

Major fans of Josh Hartnett will probably love this film, and I have always been of fan of his, but he suffers miserably throughout the film.

Comedy is resident as we watch him go from one triumph to one flounder after another.  The major roadblock in his vow is meeting the girl of his dreams at the laundromat.

1737662,3,B00006ADFO,"""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is a crude, vulgar, at times I guess it can be described as an offensive movie. In other words it's a guy's movie lol. There's something inside me saying, it's wrong for me to like this movie. This is not a ""great"" movie. I know I've seen much better movies. I consider myself a filmbuff and have seen several American classics and well as several foreign films. But, still, for some reason, despite myself, I like this movie. Then again I always seem to go for movies like this. I like the ""American Pie"" films. I liked the first ""Scary Movie"". So there is a side of me that enjoys vulgar humor.
 ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" as most people know is about a guy named Matt Sullivan (Josh Hartnett) taking a vow of celibacy for the lenght the title says. He does this because as a friend tells him ""(He's) packed with issues!"" He can't seem to get over his girfriend. Every other person he is with he compares to his ex, Nicole (Vinesse Shaw). But, the odd thing is, his way of trying to deal with this problem is by sleeping with them. So, he decides if he can get his mind off sex all of his problems will go away and he'll forget about his ex. But, he meets a girl, Erica (Shannyn Sossamon). Who just further tempts him and makes things worst for him.
 One of the reasons I like ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is that it seems to have something to say about teen dating and the importance people (of any age) have placed on sex. The film shows how that seems to be the main thing on both guys and girls mind's. There was a line in the movie that Erica gives ""God! Why won't he just sleep with me!"" That one line is a key line to the film. Teens and other people sometimes refer to sex as merely a casual act. Something you wouldn't even give a second thought too. I could if I want go into a whole moral issues here like, you know there was a time when people actually waited to become intimate after they were married, but, I won't. This is a modern world, with a new set of standards, no matter how bad they may be. But, one of the problems with the film is, after it lightly touches these ideas it stops!
 Is this a movie everyone will enjoy? No. This is purely a ""teen movie"" If adults saw this they would just think to themselves ""Is this the way MY kids are!? That's it, they're not going out for a whole year!"" But, teens will like it, and who knows, if a couple goes to see this, it may even open a door to discuss what each of them thinks about sex. And plus girls will just like staring at Hartnett, so it no lost for them either.
 Bottom-line: A good funny ""teen movie"" that actually does have something to say. I think both guys and girls will enjoy this one.",1025913600,14,2685,4.137931034482759

I just don't see what made her different. They meet and barely talk at a laundry mat, meet one more time for Josh to ask her out, spend a whole day on a bus and suddenly are completely in love. Plus her character was very unforgiving towards Josh's goal and selfish thinking everything was about her. I just didn't like her character and thought they could have written a better woman character for him.

1737758,4,B00006ADFO,"This is a good movie - but not a great one since it suffers from several weaknesses.
The most positive aspects of this movie are its two leading stars: Josh Hartnett manages to deliver a surprisingly flawless comic performance, which I didn't expect from him since he's not exactly known to be a comedy actor. Well, he has proven me to be wrong! Shannyn Sossamon was equally great as his beautiful (though slightly offbeat) love interest. She definitely steals every scene she's in!
Among the things I disliked about this movie was the totally unsympathetic character of Hartnett's roommate (""portrayed"" by the unsympathetic Paolo Costanzo who also managed to be the only negative thing I can recall about ""Road Trip""). Maybe I just don't like Costanzo...sorry!
""40 Days..."" main problem though is that the romance between Hartnett and Sossamon loses credibility since it never really gets time to develop. They meet twice in this laundromat and suddenly they're in love. In my opinion the writers should have given their two leading characters more time (and scenes together) to connect. What's so bad about a teen-comedy that runs 105 instead of 90 minutes???
By the way: I will never be able to really understand the ridiculous American rating system. This movie is (at least by European standards) absolutely harmless. It has been rated ""12"" in Germany which is the right thing to do. I watched it with the son of a colleague (he's 12) and I'm not afraid of him suffering any damages caused by this movie!

I thought the movie wasn't going to be anything more than a reason to stare at Josh for two hours, but I actually found it very funny. It was a cute love story. Although some parts not realistic, but overall it was a very entertaining story. I found all the characters to be funny except the two woman that are closest to him were both kind of rude and obnoxious in their own ways. I would of rather have him end up with a sweet girl than what he got, but otherwise I enjoyed the movie. I thought he did an excellent job, and it was a nice change from all the war movies that he has been starring in lately.",1020211200,2,719,4.034965034965035
1737761,4,B00006ADFO,"I was fairly dubious when a friend of mine asked me to go and see '40 days and 40 nights' with her. I figured she was there for Josh and the film would essentially be a vessel to appeal to the teenage-girl market. However the film pleasantly surprised me; it was witty, not overly gross and Josh Hartnett possessed comic poise.
The film's premise is really quite simple, Matt (Hartnett), a man whose been living a fairly vacuous life filled with romantic disappointment and meaningless sex decides the only way to get over his ex Nicole is to become celibate for a period of 40 days, coinciding with lent. However this proves to be very difficult as Matt falls for Erica (Shannon Sossamon) at the Laundromat. Compounded with this is every woman trying to break his vow, and every man betting on the day he'll break his celibacy.
What makes the film so funny is the series of ridiculous situations Matt finds himself in. Whilst this film is essentially one 90 minute long sex joke, it really does work. Unlike other teenpics ('American Pie', 'Road Trip') '40 days and 40 nights' has a slightly more classy approach to sex. Shock value is used at a bare minimum, and when it is it's pretty much unneeded. It is only these few moments that makes the film fall into cliched realms at times, but it is otherwise good.
Josh Hartnett is truly funny in this film. His embodiment of the slow demise of a man who is kept from sex is very funny. It was a gamble to do comedy for a man who is known for two epic war films ('Pearl Harbor', and 'Black Hawk Down'). Everyone must agree that the movement from war films to comedy is like mixing oil and water; but it works seamlessly.  Other than Josh the supporting cast are all very funny, the betting scenes in particular are hilarious.
'40 days and 40 nights' is a very welcome and impressive film. Slightly more intelligent that the standard teenpic, but not intelligent enough to stop it being escapist, essentially low brow comedy. This is not only a base teenpic comedy, but also a romantic comedy. For a teenage audience the girls will love it for Josh, and the guys will love it for the girls who tempt him; and if you don't like films purely for face value '40 days and 40 nights' is a proficient comedy.",1019865600,10,2249,4.485365853658537

I thought it was a movie that you could just watch and and not really miss anything.  Sometimes I just enjoy going to see a movie that I don't have to concentrate on every word so you don't miss the plot.  It was  nice to see Josh in all the scenes.  He is right up there next to Ben Affleck.  I have seen all of Joshs movies and he is getting better with each one, I really enjoyed him in Black Hawk Down also.",1018051200,2,511,4.06
1737763,3,B00006ADFO,"40/40 is just another romantic comedy that borders on unbelievable.  It's about a guy who makes the ultimate sacrifice to forego sex or anything related to sex for the duration of Lent (40 days).  This started as a way for Matt (Josh Hartnett) to rid himself of his nightmares and sexual claustrophobia as he has ""meaningless"" sex with other women after he got dumped by his girlfriend.  The office gets wind of this peculiar act, or non-act, and decides that it's worth betting on.  In the course of not having sex, he meets a girl he falls in love with even without physically knowing her.  Things just get tougher when people have money at stake and want him to fail, so there are many temptations along the way.  Whether he makes it or not, you'll have to watch the film (or e-mail me) to find out.
It's not a laugh-out-loud type of comedy.  It's definitely fun to watch and not crude in any way, but it doesn't stand out.
LEAP rating (each out of 5):

1737804,4,B00006ADFO,"Since the premise of this movie revolves around sex, I was half expecting to be visually bombarded with it. While there were a few scenes I, personally, could have done without . . . for the most part, it was pretty tame. Josh Hartnett is gorgeous and did a great job. He brought a sweetness and sincerity to his performance that makes the uncomfortable situations he finds himself in laughable rather than exploitive. Shannyn Sossamon is a perfect leading lady, but her character seems a little short-tempered rather early on. The chemistry between her and Josh is cute and believeable. I thought this movie was great. I couldn't give it four stars cause there were a few visual effects I couldn't put my stamp of approval on, but overall I really enjoyed it.",1015891200,,760,4.7218045112781954
1737805,4,B00006ADFO,"No, religious purists: ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is not a Biblical film, nor does it carry moral value. What it does have tucked under its sleeve is a wonderful brand of comedy that's a step up from such atrocities as ""Slackers,"" stemming from the situations of its main characters, played to perfection by an actor who throws himself into the role without hesitation.
Think of it as ""American Pie"" in reverse: Matt Sullivan (Josh Hartnett) has just broken up with his longtime girlfriend, Nicole (Vinessa Shaw), leading him to explore various sexual partners, all of which he finds himself comparing to his ex. He sneaks out of a lover's window while she steps into the bathroom; he ""fakes it"" when paired with a demanding, knows-what-she-wants aggressor; in his mind's eye, he sees his ceiling cracking open into a giant, black hole, a hole he considers his inner emptiness (it's goofy, but it provides a nice laugh).
And then, one day, the answer hits him. After paying a visit to his brother, John (Adam Trese), a whose experience in seminary aide him in advising his sibling, Matt swears off sexual practices ranging from the whole nine yards to self gratification, his relinquishment for the season of Lent.
At first, all seems to go well: he begins building model cars, throws out his magazines, videos, lubricants, etc, and crosses paths with a well-to-do girl, Erica (Shannyn Sossamon, ""A Knight's Tale""), in whom he finds a connection beyond the physical attraction that dominated his past flings. Of course, things go haywire when his work colleagues develop a web page featuring a bidding system on which day he will break down and ""do it,"" throwing his life out in the open with hilarious results.
None of this would work if not for Hartnett's ability to throw caution to the wind and make us believe in the humor and embarrassment of Matt's situations. He does well in portraying his character as a normal, sexually healthy male with confidence and ego to boot, and then one-ups himself in his latter performance as a timid, nervous wreck whose every move triggers one calamity after another.
Take, for instance, his confrontation with the slim lovelies he works with, one of whom Xeroxes a photocopy of her posterior with her phone number and offers him a good time. Two others, bound to restore ""the power"" to the female gender, begin making out in front of him, while the rest of the office waits outside for the results. And then there's his sex-starved boss, who accidentally downs a glass of orange juiced spiked with Viagra meant for Matt. Such situations aren't as risqu as some of the more low-brow comedies we've seen populating theaters in the past, but gross doesn't always mean more laughs, and here, it's a bit of a relief to see a small level of taste put to good use.
The trailers for ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" have made it abundantly clear that the movie is from the producers of ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" and while it lacks the charisma of that previous movie's British appeal, it provides an hour and a half of hearty laughs at it's main character's expense. It's not likely you'll remember it word-for-word, but the image of Hartnett walking into a meeting with a ""situation"" in his pants is hard to shake.",1015718400,,3235,4.768270944741533
1737806,5,B00006ADFO,"This is one of the best comedies I have seen at the theaters this year. Not only does Josh Hartnett do an amazing job here, the rest of the cast do too. No, this is not another teen movie. So yeah, it's all about sex, but it's also knowing how strong minded and self confident you are in certain situations. Some of the scenes in this movie are flat out funny, like when Josh goes into the meeting with a... Never mind. It's so funny though, and the story is really clever. I'd see it it again. And don't listen to critics, because you can't let anyone tell you what you'll like, cos you are the only one who knows that. And this movie is a great film with a great cast, a real plot, so if you're looking for a good laugh & a good time at the movies, I suggest you see this halrious movie.",1015632000,2,789,4.031847133757962
1737807,5,B00006ADFO,"Admittedly not a previously big Josh Hartnett fan, but I went to watch this movie on a whim, and am glad I took the plunge.
It was good to see Hartnett in a comedy role and think he faired very well.  There was such a neat innoncence in some of the lines he delivered, where they could have been really crass.  Some of the sight gags were a little gross and some a bit disturbing, but on the whole I was pleasantly surprised, and the good stuff more than made up for it.
The cast was great.. of which I recognised Hartnett, Sossomon and of course Griffin Dunne.  However, I really wished more time was spent with Hartnetts co-workers.  I would have loved to have seen their characters filled out more.
I must admit I was taken with the actor, Chris Gauthier, that played Mikey (I actually stayed to the watch the end credits to take note of his name) and when the romance between the leads became a little long, really wanted to see Mikey and the co-workers back at the internet office. I would be interested in other works this actor has appeared in.  More time spent with the actor who played Chris would have been good too, in fact all the internet guys.
That aside, I am looking forward to the release of the dvd, and will be buying a copy as soon as its available.",1015372800,6,1269,4.292887029288703

1737809,5,B00006ADFO,"Matt Sullivan (Josh Hartnett) is a web developer working San Francisco who had the woman of his dreams -- a woman so hot, in fact, that even the ""Bagel Guy"" talks about her. Perfect, until she broke his heart. Now Matt can't sustain even the shortest of relationships without suffering panic attacks.
Things get worse when the all-knowing ""Bagel Guy"" reveals that his ex-girlfriend is now engaged to her yuppy corporate executive boyfriend of two weeks. Faced with this recent escalation of his personal tragedy, Matt finds himself desperate to get over his ex-girlfriend and be able to move on. His priest-in-training older brother is little help and Matt is suddenly struck by a possible solution: he'll give up sex and all physical intimacy for 40 days.
His roommate (Paulo Costanzo, ""Road Trip"") thinks he's insane and when his web-development co-workers find out they secretly start a betting pool on how long he'll actually hold out. When the geeks start tracking the results on the Internet, the pool climbs into the thousands and suddenly everyone is trying to influence the outcome.
Faced with gorgeous co-workers trying to seduce him in the supply room and other temptations, Matt finds himself taking refuge in the laundromat. That's when he meets Erica (Shannyn Sossamon, ""A Knight's Tale"") a woman unlike any he has met and the first woman he's had any real feelings for since his ex-girlfriend. The problem is that she doesn't know about the vow -- yet.
Just as things start really working with Erica and as he enters his final week, Matt's ex-girlfriend shows up at his door and turns up the heat even more. With the clock ticking, the bets rising, the temptations growing more enticing, the saboteurs working, his relationship with Erica growing, his hormones raging and his ex-girlfriend pursuing him -- the question of whether or not Matt will be able to hold out is the one on everyone's mind.
This movie is a hilarious romp through one guy's most desperate attempt to let go of the woman who broke his heart and take charge of his future.  It is a trendy and humorous perspective on abstinence and is probably one of the funniest movies I've seen since ""Road Trip"".  I'd definitely watch this movie again and plan to buy it on DVD when it is available.",1015113600,5,2272,4.823076923076923
1737810,2,B00006ADFO,"Not only was this movie about sex, there was nothing else about this movie other than sex. The movie is replete with aberrent and open sex talk and acts, including more euphimisms for masturbation than Hemmingway's blood alcohol content on ....well, any given day, plus a slightly used condom scene that there is no other way to describe but ""Ewww[...]"".
No one was really abstaining from sex in the movie...even upper management at work and previously ""vowed celibate"" members of the clergy.  The movie is a poster child for sexual misconduct in the workplace and an exceedingly bad example of how *not* to get yourself something that Ajax won't take off in this era of continually new and improved STD's.
Not that it isn't funny, as it does have it moments, but they are few and far between.  Wouldn't be bad for ... [a low price] when it hits the video shelves, but price for theater admission is aiming too high for this flick.

1737812,2,B00006ADFO,"Think of 40 Days & 40 Nights as the adult and mature version of American Pie, except that it has more of a plot and character development than its teenage counterpart.  The basic story is about Matt, a guy who have no problem getting laid every so often, but after his breakup with long time girlfriend Nicole, sex have become somewhat meaningless.  So to get his life back on track, he decided to give up sex for Lent, and that includes no bodily intimacy of any kind with women.  Unfortunately, he meets this incredible girl name Erica, and it becomes a test of will power for him to finish what he started.
For a movie that deals with sex and is very bold about it, expect a lot of jokes and dialogues surrounding that topic.  Mix it up with some physical comedies and a great deal with sexual tension, that's pretty much what the film is about.  Josh Hartnett did a passable job as the lead, kind of a let down after his brilliant performance in Black Hawk Down.  Overall I got a few laughs from 40 Days & 40 Nights, but I thought the point of the movie (if there ever was one) sort of got lost towards the end.  Ultimately it falls into the same pattern that defines romantic comedies which you've seen many times before, I found nothing special or memorable about this experience.",1014854400,24,1286,4.40084388185654

talk about an Anti-Male movie, reducing men to blathering idiots, ruled by hormones an devoid of any redeeming qualities!!!!!!
I know this movie came out a while ago, and I just watched it now, but in today's world and sensibilities, to make light of a man being raped by a woman like this??

others have already said , that if it were reversed, there would have been an uproar:  so why is it okay for a man to be raped by a woman?????

and another thing: poor little Josh Hartnett, who can get laid so easily, that going any amount of time without sex is unbearable to him. Bully for him...men should be so lucky, as he is....totally unrealistic....

This movie was absolutely as bad as it can get, and the funny thing is, in spite of the crudeness, and utter immaturity, I was getting a chuckle or two , here and there, until the rape scene had to suck all the life out of this movie.
