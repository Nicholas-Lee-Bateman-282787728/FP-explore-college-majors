5624399,4,B00BIYQOXY,"FILMED IN ENGLISH, BUT VERY JAPANESE IN ARTISTIC STYLE

Director Hisako Matsui films this movie mostly in English, but with a very Japanese artistic style that some Westerners may find difficult to interpret or may not even enjoy. (let me explain below)
This movie delves into the life of Leonie Gilmour and her son Isamu Noguchi, the famous sculptor, as the plight to find one's true self.  It also uses them as a backdrop to explore social issues including women's rights during the early 1900's.  It is poetic in both dialog and cinematography in very Japanese ways.

THE PLOT: Leonie is a bright, educated, American woman who agrees to become editor, and ultimately lover, to the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi.  She bears his child (Isamu) out of wedlock and follows him to Japan.  One can imagine the resulting complications for a smart woman of pre-suffrage United States.  The recounting of Leonie's time in Japan serves to amplify those professional, social and romantic conflicts as she deals with the cultural shock of life for women in Japan (an even more patriarchal society).  Leonie comes to the realization that she will only be his mistress as Yone already has a wife.  He tells her ""this is the culture of Japan and there is nothing you can do about it"".  To her credit, Leonie takes her son and forges her own path while encouraging his strengths, spending years more in Japan.  This movie expounds on that line of finding one's true self as Isamu grows to college age.  He secures a benefactor and applies himself to becoming a doctor in America to show gratitude (despite the fact he is clearly an artist by nature).  When Leonie finds out Isamu's course of study as a doctor, she attempts to set him straight.

The backdrop of post industrialized Japan is also very interesting.  The references are fleeting, but the movie opens near the start of the Russo-Japanese War.  Japan had recently emerged from essentially a feudal period, after observing the changing nature of warfare during the American Civil War. In just a few decades from that observation, Japan emerged and then defeated the largest military power of their time (Russia), much to the world's surprise.  The movie shows early on how Anti-Japanese sentiment in the US had already intensified before WWI.

OTHER THOUGHTS: For those not familiar with Japanese literature and film, there is not that western focus of climax and dnouement that we are used to.  I admit, Japanese lit classes were a challenge for me as a Japanese major.  Their stories tend to amble along and then simply end.  The journey or process is more important than the destination.  As Leonie's Tea Ceremony instructor more aptly puts it - ""the expression is MOST important.  The tension of drama lies in the delicate grace of a perfect moment, the fragility of something beautiful."" - This very Japanese style is perhaps appropriate when illustrating a life story, since that is kind of how life goes.  We muddle through it, and then someday it just ends.  This movie is not so much an entertainment piece as it is an illustration, an expression.  Western viewers will find the character development challenging as the story skips from event to event.  Though I really appreciated this movie, I also realize the style is not for everyone.  My intent is to describe so each reader can decide for themselves if the movie is for them.  I found the life of Leonie compelling and the search for true self poetic and thought provoking.

Special mention should go to Emily Mortimer who proves she is far more than just a favorite actress from the UK.  Her performance here is truly outstanding. I dropped my rating to 4 stars only because I felt some of the issues they tried to express were not that effectively conveyed.  However, the production values are excelent and the movie is beautiful in many places.",1368921600,78,3857,4.823439878234399

5624410,5,B00BIYQOXY,"This is an EXCELLENT movie, the acting is incredible, Emily Mortimer is wonderful to watch as are all the other actors, including Christina Hendricks, Shid Nakamura and Jan Milligan. This is set at the turn of the 20th Century, based on the TRUE STORY of Leonie, mother of sculptor and artist Isamu Noguchi. This film is a beautiful depiction of a richly varied life across borders, and how childhood shapes personality.

The crew on this movie include many high profile names such as the Oscar winning composer Jan A. P. Kaczmarek (Finding Neverland) and Director of Photography Tetsuo Nagata from ""La Vie en Rose"".

The original version that was released in Japan to rave reviews and ranked high in their top 10 box office during it's opening, is like a David Lean style epic. Set in the early 1900s, the production design and locations across the USA and Japan are nostalgically wonderful and the amount of effort put the production of this film shows clearly through the amazing footage and photography. Cinematographers take note. The American cut is unfortunately a subpar edited version of this really great Japanese original; they cut 40 mins of footage out for reasons such as ""impatient US audiences"" and difficulty getting a longer movie into art-house theatres under limited theatrical release. Ironically, the pacing and editing of the longer version far surpass the USA cut. In fact the longer cut seems to last less time because of the way the story is told through the editing. They sadly changed from a standard chronological movie to an unnecessary flashback style edit which makes it perhaps difficult to follow.

Without further ado, I can only say if you can, find and watch the Japan ORIGINAL cut as this is how the director intended the movie to be made -- most versions including the DVD, Blu-Ray and Amazon Prime Video are the shortened USA cut. The Japan version is edited more cleanly like a traditional movie and with the additional 40 minutes of relevant footage, based on true events, this charming story is a beautiful film, full of life, philosophy and feeling.",1510444800,2,2093,4.906779661016949

5624415,5,B00BIYQOXY,"The film Leonie is the type of film where one scratches their head in wonder and asks, how did I miss this one?  It is a stunning and thought provoking depiction of the woman behind the artist that Director Hisako Matsui was inspired to produce after reading the biography The Life of Isamu Noguchi, renowned modern landscape artist of the 20th century. Isamu was the son of Japanese poet Yone Noguchi (Shido Nakumura) and American editor and journalist Leonie Gilmour (Emily Mortimer).  Another interesting bit of back-story, it took Matsui 14 screenplay drafts to what became the final draft for the film.  To many Leonie Gilmour may be considered a subtle chapter in the history of womens suffrage, but to most that watch the film may see much more.

Leonie bridged the gap nationally and internationally in the movement towards womens rights as well as freedom and independence while attempted to hold on to the responsibility of a womans place is in the home during the early 20th century.  As she grew up in a home where her mother, too, typified the independent woman that ran a commune in California, it served as a springboard to the life she would forge for herself as a teacher and journalist.  That will be challenged and tested when she travels abroad and experiences a romantic encounter with Yone Noguchi, which she helped to collaborate and edit his book The American Diary of a Japanese Woman.  Viewers will see the differences of two worlds between east and west of modern Japan in terms its traditions and roles of men and women that gradually changed; Leonie defied convention that contributed to her independent life when her romance falters with Yone and is forced find teach English to Japanese students and to rear Isamu and later daughter Ailes on her own and with the help of a Japanese house maid. It is during this period that shows how Isamu observes his mothers strong will and independence during hard times, and he becomes the man in the family and also takes lessons from the builders constructing their home.  The roots of his craftsmanship and artistry slowly develops within these moments of the film, and eventually takes flight when he leaves Japan during the onset of war and Leonie prompts him to the United States as a way not to be tangled in the debacle of the Russo-Japanese war.

Although Leonie is not a whirlwind epic story, it takes a piece of art and history and zooms in on the life and story of a legendary artist and centers upon the woman that inspired his path towards creativity.  Emily Mortimer does an exceptional performance depicting the life of Leonie Gilmour who was the epitome of the woman of the early 20th century that sought respect as well an independent life.  After watching the film, one may find it interesting and enlightening and well worth the time to watch.",1506124800,2,2832,4.759183673469388

This is a biodrama, navigating the ordeals and pleasures unique to the life of Leonie Gilmour, played stunningly by Emily Mortimer. I can just hear myself taking off on what likely sounds like a flight of superlatives, but it's just that good, and it's been a while since I've seen a film I didn't want to end.  A Bryn Mawr graduate, recipient of a Sorbonne scholarship- and we're talking 1900- Leonie is way ahead of her time. A wonderfully creative and articulate woman, lover of the Arts, becomes the editor for the just-starting-out Japanese poet Yone Noguchi, winningly arrogantly played by Shido Nakamura. Mortimer is adept at showing the diverse aspects of Leonie-- aggressive, timid, deeply loving, aloof. The story spans the globe, and explores the intricacies of characters and cultures, portraying the immense adaptability and resilience of Leonie. Hisako Matsui's directing is spot-on, his contribution to the gorgeous script exceptional, the language naturally eloquent.  Natsuo Nagata's cinematography is breathtaking. The emergence of another amazing artist is integral to the storyline, but I'm being purposefully vague about the narrative because I want it to unfold for you in the way it did for me, without spoiling.

5624440,5,B00BIYQOXY,"Beautiful, riveting and inspiring.

This is film is adapted from a biography of the famous artist and sculptor Isamu Noguchi with the focus on Noguchi's mother, (American) Leonie Gilmour.

Leonie was educated at Bryn Mawr, but she understood that her strong interest in poetry had to come from experience not books. This is how she met a Japanese writer Yone Noguchi, the father of her son Isamu. Leonie had struggles, as a single mother of Isamu and later of her daughter Ailes Gimour. This film presents the portrait of a woman, mother, writer with a love of life and art that she passed down to both children.

The cinematography is beautiful whether focused on America or Japan. The direction never is off, the film flows. The soundtrack made a beautiful frame to hold this movie.  While Emily Mortimer as Leonie was the standout performance, all the actors, whether speaking English or Japanese, were uniformly strong and fully realized personalities.  Looking at the credits, I can see why this movie is such a successful balance between West and East.

Stay for the credits to see some of the accomplishments of Isamu Noguchi. Accomplishments which never would have existed without the Leonie's life and choices. I wish this movie was hours longer, but it is a beautiful testament to a unique woman and art.",1491868800,7,1314,4.896396396396397
5624441,4,B00BIYQOXY,"Emily Mortimer is surely one of the best English actors gracing the screen.  I've always noticed her in ""supporting"" roles because she stood out, even against such shining stars as Cate Blanchett.  Here she is square in the eye of the story, as well as the camera.  And she doesn't falter there, even against the shining star that is her son, Isamu Nogouchi, the world acclaimed artist.  When a mother has a famous child, her story and worth is generally relegated to the level of a ""supporting role.""  But common sense and science tells us that great people usually get that way via early life experiences, for good or ill . .. or a mixture of both.  Leonie was a rareity in her time: an educated woman but no wealthy family to support her.  Hence her desire to attend Bryn Mawr was for a practical reason: to gain skills and be independent . . . as well as to live an extraordinary life.  But like many women still do, she became infatuated with a man without honor and sincerity and had his child.  That took her life in a very different direction.  Children change everything.  Or at least they should.  Leonie, to her credit, allowed her children to be the center of her life and her decision making.  At the same time, she continued to engage actively in life, both in the US and Japan, where this journey takes place.  Her understanding of her son's talent was a great force in unleashing Isamu's career.  She died at the age of 60, much too young.  You might say Leonie played a supporting role in the life of her famous son.  But that's only if you willfully ignore the greatness in the characters of the people who make it possible for that greatness to grow and become a force in the world.  This film is remarkable in recognizing the value and power of those roles, and how much strength, perseverance, adaptability, courage and faith is required to fulfill those roles.  Emily Mortimer is sublime and incandescent especially as she ages.  The discovery of this film is one of the reasons I love my Amazon Prime.

DVD
2010

Film = barely three (3) stars; score = four (4) stars; lead acting = 2.5 stars; editing = 2.5 stars. Channeling BBC period dramas, Director Hisako Matsui manages to tease out a somewhat memorable film against the odds (some of which seem to be self imposed).  In addition to the usual bilingual challenges that come with an English/Japanese  co-production,  Matsui is  dealing with the miscasting of the two principal characters and impoverished editing (see below).  The Director (who is credited as a co-author of the scenario) seems to be unwilling/unable to fully leverage the notoriety of artist Isamu Noguchi (inserting some expository text at the end of the film is too little and much too late!) and the backdrop of epoch-changing events (emerging women rights movements, major wars, etc.) enveloping America and Japan during the late 1890s and early 1900s.  Acting by most of the Japanese cast is excellent and easily captures (and holds) the viewer's interest.  Not so much for the American cast.  The leading actress (American) and actor (Japanese) underplay their roles; their often remote/wooden acting fails to reach out and engage the viewer.  Lack of drama in the midst of dramatic events can be painful to watch.  Cinematography (wide screen, color) and scene lighting are fine.  Sound is OK.  Score is excellent, but a little bit much when it comes to string instruments.  Editing joins the majority of scenes with fades to white, a less than creative linking that quickly becomes boring.  Lack of continuity editing toward the end of the film looks like a frantic maneuver to pad the movie and/or insert events that could not be fully developed or completed  because the money ran out. (The film also ends rather abruptly.)  Not all spoken Japanese is subtitled.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1473638400,,1931,5.105431309904153

5624499,4,B00BIYQOXY,"As I did not know who Leonie was the title of the film was intriguing.  Most moving to me was the courage that this woman had at a time where the role of women was limited.  Courage to travel alone to an unknown country where she knew no one, knew nothing of the culture, or the language at the turn of the century.  It isn't till we get near the end of the film that we discover that she is the mother of a noted Japanese sculpture and how his life was shaped by the influence of the grandmother on her daughter.  Her (Leonie) role seemed to consist of her giving birth and then giving her son a piece of advice at a time he needed it most.  After that, upon reflection it was happenstance that began with the fateful day she met the sculptures' father.",1464652800,2,754,4.136986301369863

5624537,4,B00BIYQOXY,Bio-pic of a talented editor and go-getter who gets mismatched with a Japanese Poet. It seems she is really the talent behind the scenes and he lures her to Japan under false pretenses; she is able to get her son set free from WWII and guide his talent thereafter.

5624559,3,B00BIYQOXY,I am a huge Emily Mortimer fan but this movie was very hard to watch. It did have some redeeming value in showing Leonie's influential relationship on her talented son but it left me feeling very sad. The poet was such a disappointment.

5624725,3,B00BIYQOXY,"There were some beautifully photographed moments in this movie even though it was economically made.  The main character was not portrayed as anything extraordinary, other than rejecting convention.  Perhaps the writing was too constrained or the actress was too concerned with projecting Katherine Hepburn kind of eccentricity and didn't want to show the 'vulnerability of a woman on her own in those circumstances . That vulnerability had some delicious opportunities  for drama.  I felt I was given a warered-down version of the original story.",1457049600,,547,5.476190476190476

5624729,3,B00BIYQOXY,"Interesting biopic of a woman ahead of her tmes, but very self conscious and rife with irritating, incessant music.  Also creepily suggestive of possible child sexual abuse, the main character constantly pawing her son even into his teens and 20's. Then again, perhaps that is how the actual person of Leonie related to her son. Otherwise, the actress or director had a strange interpretation of the mother/son relationship.",1456876800,,424,5.235294117647059
5624730,2,B00BIYQOXY,I came away from the movie feeling the characters were not fully developed.  More than once I thought about not watching the movie to the end.

The lead actress needs to take some serious open your heart acting workshops = do some gut-wrenching work with a teacher who gives her all the safety she requires to explore her vulnerability & shatter her fears...this is a role that needed that double edged sword of outrage & passionate determination...so much of the time, there were wasted close-up shots of her vapid expression & the screen was void of any real struggle--I guess the new technique is all about underplaying the score & allowing the story to tell itself, while the actors go on cruise-mode, phoning in their performance...",1456012800,,722,4.82258064516129

The movie, based on a book about Leonie, is enlightening as to the development of a consummate artist, but she deserves to be recognized and remembered in her own right.  Apparently she was an excellent poet one one helluva woman.

Let's face it, I would have watched this movie if the story had been even more difficult than it was - and it was difficult.  Leonie's story is one of multiple trials, dedication to principle and her children, and courage in all things.

Acting - good.  (I'm a fan of Emily Mortimer so you might want to argue with me on that one.  I have no complaints.)  Scenery - excellent.  Story line true,  so it's tough going,  Characterization - well developed.  Script - believable.",1454198400,2,864,4.6866666666666665

I was able to visit with him for a short time at an international Sculpture Conference when he was older in the 1970's and certainly appreciated not only the experience but, also his confidence in seriously questioning the featured Art Historians.

5625162,3,B00BIYQOXY,"Leonie is supposed to be a strong independent woman who has chosen to live life her own way.  To me, though, this is the sad story of a woman who put aside her own artistic and literary ambitions to ""edit"" (really to express the broken English in a more literary way) the poetry of a man she comes to love and whose son she bears.  Even after it is clear that he no longer has any romantic interest in her, she goes to Japan to be with him only to be treated as his literary slave.  When she realizes he has a real wife, she has the gumption to leave--the film would have us believe--but she actually remains in Japan working for this man, though she also works for others.  She seems to acquire minimal skills in the Japanese language.  Eventually, she has her children and nature.  Since when is feminism about giving up one's ambitions for the sake of lover and children?

The photography is beautiful, and Emily Mortimer is excellent.  Mary Kay Place was just awful, possibly because of script.

We were pleasantly surprised when we realized that we watched this film on a laptop placed atop an Isamu Noguchi coffee table.  That made it a bit more real.",1438041600,,1157,4.440758293838862

His mother gave him free reign to create everything from brush paintings to a small house by the sea.  He was a transcontinental kid led by his mother's free spirit. This is the story of her life, I hope all true, an American woman of an earlier century who stretched the bounds of convention by living with a Japanese man and living in Japan and within Japanese culture.  She likewise had another child, a daughter, in an unmarried and unconventional way.  She herself was a creative thinker and, from this film's portrayal, seemed to treasure all that is beautiful.  I recommend this insightful film and, especially, further exploration of the great artist that resulted from her singular vision.",1402531200,6,801,4.860294117647059
5625183,4,B00BIYQOXY,"It would be impossible to include every twist and turn of the lives of Leonie Gilmour and Yone Noguchi so the makers of this film chose to focus on Leonie and they made the correct choice.  She was a woman very much ahead of her time -- a student at the very young Bryn Mawr College, intelligent, aggressive, not afraid to embrace life regardless of what it brought her way.  Emily Mortimer is a very convincing Leonie -- she captures the spirit of a very definitely spirited woman.  The supporting actors are all fine in their roles too.  The film was obviously made on a tight budget but that constraint doesn't harm the picture -- it contributes to making it the intimate film that it is.  Yone Noguchi -- the father of Leonie's son, the sculptor, artist, set designer, etc. Isamu Noguchi -- was a complex man -- a poet from Japan who gained fame in the US with the help of Leonie who edited his work.  A man who was engaged to one woman, impregnated another, while also having relationships with male acquaintances and who ultimately fathered nine children with the Japanese woman that he married.  Isamu Noguchi like his mother also was a free-spirited who traveled the world in pursuit of his art.  Ultimately this is the story of three very gifted people -- a mother, father and son who lived an unconventional life -- at times together, but mostly apart -- and yet all achieved what can only be called remarkable lives.  The final scenes of the film are quite touching and beautiful in keeping with the spirit of the people involved who pursued art and beauty in their daily lives.
I defy anyone to see the film and not come away wanting to know more about all three of these people.",1402099200,40,1691,4.518032786885246
5625184,4,B00BIYQOXY,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting and directing were top-notch. Compared to American movies, the acting and pacing were slower, but that is part of the beauty of the movie. These facets embody Japanese culture and reflect the art of the director. Hats off to the director for being the nail that sticks up and not fearing being hammered down.

Leonie didn't always make the best decisions for herself or her children, but she did as she got older. I married cross-culturally and have a child. It's not easy (at any time) to raise a biracial child in the United States. So I understand why she took Isamu to Japan, at least that reason; however Yone was scoundrel on many levels and fobbed this off on what was typical for Japanese culture.

I highly recommend this movie. Perhaps reading some historical background (both of Leonie and Japan) prior to the movie will help naysayers enjoy the depth and beauty of it more.",1400889600,6,929,4.693251533742331

5625188,3,B00BIYQOXY,"Many times people wonder if the homosexuality or bisexuality of certain famous people will be covered in biopics of their lives.  This question was brought up in films about Amelia Earhart, Hoover, the guy in ""A Beautiful Mind,"" and several others.  Please see the book ""Queer Compulsions: Race, Nation, and Sexuality in the Affairs of Yon Noguchi.""  In that book, the author writes that not only did Noguchi get with Leonie Gilmour, but he had a white wife, AND may have had a homoerotic relationship with a white dude named Charles Stoddard.  The author never asserts that the relationship may have been consummated; she just says their correspondence sure did get passionate.  Before watching this film, I wondered if they were going to sweep that relationship under the rug.  However, they do not.  We see Yon being very physical with a Western dude and Leonie expressing with exhaustion, ""You've been missing several months and you come home unapologetic WITH A MAN!?""  In fact, I don't think the film ever shows Yon's Japanese wife, but here we see his possible male, white lover.  Wow!  On a side note, the reason why I know about Isamu Noguchi is because he was one of Frida Kahlo's many lovers.  However, that fact never comes up in the flick.",1386288000,,1252,4.803738317757009

5625201,4,B00BIYQOXY,"'Leonie' tells the story of Leonie Gilmour, a woman ahead of her time. Born around the dawn of the 20th century she is fiercely independent and will beome the mother of sculptor/designer Isamu Noguchi. Leonie becomes the editor and lover of esteemed Japanese poet Yone Noguchi whom she meets in the US.  Their relationship sours and he leaves for Japan leaving behind a pregnant Leonie. She raises her son alone but eventually goes to Japan to try to work things out with Yone. She works hard to adapt to Japanese culture and earns her own living teaching English. Emily Mortimer gives a fine portrayal of Leonie except for speaking in a bizarre Southern accent when Leonie was in actuality born and raised in a working class family in NYC.

Where the film falters is in providing no context for the breakdown of the Gilmour/Noguchi relationship. One day they are in love and the next he is leaving her for Japan. Similiarly little is shown of Isamu Noguchi's early development as an artist. I suspect some of these problems come because this film had approximately 30 minutes cut from the original version made for release in Japan. Still this is a very worthwhile film given the interesting storyline, the beautiful period settings and the fine acting.",1374019200,2,1254,4.8279069767441865

I wonder what they did with their new language? My guess was to kill American solders.

5625203,4,B00BIYQOXY,"100 years later, one can easily forget how difficult it was for a women to forge her own path through the obstacles of every societal norm. Indeed Leonie Gilmore was not only ahead of her time, but even our time.

Leonie Gilmore - an educated female at the turn of the century - was not an idealogue, as let's say Emma Goldman. She was not trying to convert anyone to a particular point of view but instead trying to live her life - totally independently of the social values or patriarchal constraints of both the American and the Japanese world.

The two leads Emily Mortimer (as Leonie Gilmore) and Shidu Nakamura (as Yone Nagachi) are exceptional in their roles as two loves mismatched in their views.  He is a poet of Japanese birth who is still tied to the customs of his world and believes that women should walk behind the man and even consent to being a mere mistress of someone important.  She is a fiercely intelligent woman who walks behind nobody. However the child actors in the film are very weak characters, and I had to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars for that deficiency in the movie.  The color cinematography is glorious, with an Asian flair for color and texture.

Like the Japanese tea ceremony, this film has many ""moments"" that made me reflect on important societal issues.  Leonie's mother is entirely self-sufficient in California on a farm, rooted to the earth, but fails to appreciate the importance of a father/male influence for her grandson. Leonie gets pregnant from another man, after moving to Japan, but refuses to tell her husband who the father is.  Leonie recognizes the artistic gifts of her son, and urges him to follow that path, even when he thinks that medical school is the better choice.  Leonie returns to the land at the end of her life...becoming unified in spirit and mind, with her own mother.

If you can consider this film as poetry, rather like a sequence of Haiku poems, it will interest you.  If you expect fast dialogue or narrative movement, it will disappoint.  I don't expect a large American audience for this quietly interesting picture, but - notwithstanding its flaws - it made me think. Now that's something few Hollywood films do anymore.",1371686400,9,2212,4.68733850129199

Leonie is a educated American woman who agrees to become editor, and in time - lover, to the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi - I have to wonder how famous he would have been without her interjections. She bears his child (Isamu) and follows him to Japan only to find he already has a wife and sets her up as his mistress. She leaves him securing jobs teaching English. Once on her own she again gives birth and never reveals who the birth father is.
 It's also interesting because the film has a Japanese director, it's filmed in Japan and yet it seems truly to mock Japanese sexism. Yone is definitley the villian, sexist, violent and selfish, I believe she fell in love with him because of his creativity and his constant pursuit of her.

From the first moment, her grating voice in the narration and all through the film offset that feeling of artistic grace so completely that I often watched with sound off and subtitles, missing the music. I like slow movies, movies with beauty, art and grace but this one had only a bit of that amidst the dark colors worn at the time. Much of this setting was very restrictive like the early years of last century, both for America and especially for Japan. Featured a bad relationship and not much (if any) depth or inspiration save a bit with her son; who was 1/2 Japanese and looked it as a child but my other complaint was that when they switched to him as an adult he didn't look even 1% Japanese. Found it boring actually. Fast forwarded here and there. Gave it 3 stars for being a film of a pioneering woman with courage, for some of the ambient scenery and for being a true story (which it seemed by the credits in the end).",1522627200,,960,4.368715083798882
