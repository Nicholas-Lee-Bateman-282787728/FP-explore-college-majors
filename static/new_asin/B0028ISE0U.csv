8356284,5,B0028ISE0U,"Brilliantly directed, acted & excellent cinematography. Set in 1950s England, story exposes the prejudices on both sides (black & white people). Complicated whodunit. Really well acted, fascinating characters.",1505174400,,209,6.5
8356285,5,B0028ISE0U,"PLOT: a dead girl is found on dead in a park. She is a black girl passing for white. Was race the killers motive?

1959~a stunningly beautiful girl is found dead in a park in London. She was stabbed 10 times in the heart. The killer really hated this girl. The autopsy finds she is also 3 months pregnant. The white boyfriend is devastated. But his ""alibi"" is not very good. Nigel Patrick is first rate as the Detective in charge of the case. He finds that ""Sapphire"" is black or actually bi racial which is why she started ""passing for white""....could race be the reason for her death? Racial divided London and prejudice factor strongly in this story. Suspects include her fianc who is white, his bigot father and family, an ex black boyfriend, and jealous other black boyfriends. This is a great story that moves along slowly and we see how Sapphire had a hidden life as both a bi racial person who liked being white more than black. Very well done. This is in technicolor and very well done. First rate plot. Great story twist. it will keep you watching and glued to the very end. 5 STARS~",1467244800,,1093,4.437810945273632
8356286,5,B0028ISE0U,"Thanks to our friends at the Criterion Collection, ""Sapphire"" is finally available on homevideo in the United States.  Released as part of their Eclipse series, ""Basil Dearden's London Underground,"" this digital version doesn't require you to purchase the entire four DVD box set. Winner of the 1960 BAFTA for ""Best British Film,"" Sapphire is first and foremost a well-crafted police procedural. Basil Dearden, who is known for dealing with social issues (e.g., ""Victim"" deals with the blackmailing of gay men, when homosexuality was illegal in Britain), tackles brewing racial tensions in 1950s London in this film.  Janet Green's Edgar Award-winning screenplay does an excellent job of balancing a solid murder mystery with a provocative look at race relations.  The cast is generally first-rate with top notch performances by Nigel Patrick, Earl Cameron, Yvonne Mitchell (who received a BAFTA nomination), and Bernard Miles. Harry Waxman's gritty cinematography was honored by the British Society of Cinematographers.

For a contemporary audience, some of the dialog may seem a bit dated and generate a few unintentional laughs. For example, there's a scene at a jazz club where a character by the name of Mr. Tulips gives the lead detectives an ""education"" about black people that is a howl. There's another scene involving a noticeably androgynous female cop. These minor issues aside, ""Sapphire"" is thought-provoking as it is entertaining.  It was certainly miles ahead of anything Hollywood was doing in the 1950s.

So, if you want to see an entertaining story with something to say, check out ""Sapphire."" For those interested in the box set, it also includes the previously mentioned ""Victim,"" ""All Night Long"" (a contemporary re-working of Shakespeare's ""Othello"" set in the jazz world), and perhaps Dearden's best known film, ""The League of Gentleman,"" a crime caper. The latter is also perhaps the most accessible to a general audience, but all four films are collectable in their own right.",1436832000,,2002,5.319620253164557
8356287,5,B0028ISE0U,"I saw the preview in a theatre when I was a kid  years ago, as my aunt dragged me out of the theatre saying I should't be interested in things like this.
 But, I never forgot the title of this movie and finally found Sapphire 48 years later.
 it is Noir type movie but I like this movie.",1413072000,,287,3.913793103448276
8356288,1,B0028ISE0U,This movie will not play on blue ray or the regular dvd player. so what am I suppose to do with it except send it back.,1376438400,2,119,3.6153846153846154
8356289,5,B0028ISE0U,Excellent example of early English look at Carribean race relations. A fraught time/experience for many British peoples brought up with a Imperialist background; and with the typical C. Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest as applied especially to those races whose skin colour was of a darker hue than the usual British citizen in the 1950's. Congratulations must go to the director Basil Dearden.,1369180800,4,404,5.230769230769231
8356290,5,B0028ISE0U,"Very Unusual film, very different. Wonderful photography and what a clever twist at the end.  Well worth watching.",1278288000,,114,5.333333333333333
