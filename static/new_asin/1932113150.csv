7801513,5,1932113150,"This is an excellent introduction to the use of trapping in knife fighting. Hochheim is a talented instructor.  In addition to great technique, he has an energetic manner, he's lucid, and he's able to demonstrate clearly the sometimes opaque techniques of trapping hands.  I compare this in my own mind with another well known instructor, one who I particularly like, but one who seems never able to slow things down to the point where I can truly follow him when he demonstrates trapping techniques.  In contrast, I can always follow Hochheim, both what he's doing and why he's doing it.  I should think that anyone who is a student or follower of Hochheim or just wants a really good introduction to how trapping hands can be used in knife fighting would want to own this video.",1236556800,,780,4.713235294117647
