8146591,5,B000IOM1EG,An excellent 2 movie DVD on the old west. I like the actors and actresses in both DVD's and it well covered my expectations. Good story lines in both movies. In black and white but the quality is quite good.,1382745600,,207,4.2
8146592,2,B000IOM1EG,Even the presence of Adele Jergens couldn't make this cheapie worth watching. The production values were bad even for this time of filmmaking. I wouldn't recommend this package.,1359331200,,177,5.357142857142857
8146593,2,B000IOM1EG,"These films are very cheap and look it. One has to love B-westerns in order to like them. I have watched westerns since 1955 and believe I can rate what is good and what is not. OK, one can see some of those great western character actors in these films. It is small bonus. Lonesome Trail is a one star picture and Silver Star three star picture, maybe even a bit better. It has a good story.

What should be given to Shane, Seachers, Magnicent Seven and Warlock if these are given five stars? Perhaps these are participating in an amateur contest and the ratings reflect it.",1198368000,3,575,4.373831775700935

8146595,5,B000IOM1EG,"Robert L. Lippert, known as ""The Quickie King"" put out a considerable number of ""B"" movies during the late forties and early fifties...some were real klunkers, however tucked away amongst the tripe are a few real diamonds in the rough.  ""The Lonesome Trail"" and ""The Silver Star"" are two real gems.

Both features were produced by Earle Lyon and directed by Richard Bartlett, and both producer and director took acting roles in the movies.  OK, let there be no doubt about it, these are real low budget works...the casts in both features are filled out with names from Hollywood's 'Poverty Row' and the production values are extremely limited.  Having said that the film makers do the most with their limited budgets.

""Lonesome Trail"" concerns a small rancher (John Agar) who returns home from the Indian Wars to find his valley has been co-opted by baddies (Lyon and Bartlett).  When Agar is seriously wounded in his gun arm, he develops a profficiency with bow and arrow and seeks revenge.  A nice twist on a standard western.

But the REAL jewel here is ""The Silver Star.""  Written by Ian McDonald, who played Gary Cooper's nemesis in ""High Noon"" we are presented with an anti-High Noon theme.  Earle Lyon as the less than brave Sheriff, runs to the train station to buy a ticket out of town when the baddies arrive, rather than stand tall, like Coop and utter ""I think I ought to stay.""  Despite the low budget there is a real story being told here, and it is in some respets, more realistic than it's inspiration,""High Noon.""

In addistion to Earle Lyon as the Sheriff and Richard Bartlett as the Gunman, the cast is rounded out with veteran western heroine Marie Windsor, and features Edgar Buchanan, Lon Chaney and Barton Maclain.  Oh, did I mention the killer ballad sung throughout by Country music legend Jimmy Wakely?  This is a GREAT western for all lovers of the old beat up B movies.

Thanks VCI and Kit Parker for bringing these movies to light after so many years.",1158451200,16,1981,4.701449275362319
