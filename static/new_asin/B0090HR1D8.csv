5200896,5,B0090HR1D8,"I love the praise baby videos! I started with my oldest child, and now my new baby loves them also. Very calming and peaceful for playtime!",1360886400,,139,4.384615384615385
5200897,5,B0090HR1D8,I was able to watch it with my granddaughter. It held her attention and we both really enjoyed watching it.,1359849600,,107,4.4
5200898,2,B0090HR1D8,"My family owns all the Praise Baby DVDs. We have used them on a daily basis for over 4 yrs. I was very excited to see they had a new one. I ordered 6 for myself and others. We were extremely disappointed that the menu works incorrectly, there are no child- lead voices and some Of the songs are repeat from the older DVDs. My husband tried contacting the website and the email came back. My complaints are not with amazon, the ordering and shipping was great. My complaint is with the product.",1355529600,5,493,4.311827956989247
5200899,1,B0090HR1D8,"We were excited about this newest addition to our collection, but it is all DUPLICATES.  Poor duplicates too, with BARS on the right and left side so they could reuse old footage.  Didn't even bother to expand the sides like in the three whole new songs.

Sad pathetic effort and they should be ashamed for cheating people like this.",1353628800,8,333,4.610169491525424
5200900,2,B0090HR1D8,"I also noticed that all but the first 3 songs on the dvd were repeats of the other Praise Baby DVDs songs with a border around them. My dvd also did not play through (if you select ""play all songs"" it only plays the first one) and because of this, my 8 month old refuses to sit still and watch this dvd even though he loves all the others in the series and it's usually no problem. I wish Big House Kids spent the time it took to perfect this product before putting it out to the public. Pretty disappointed.",1352505600,7,508,4.09
5200901,1,B0090HR1D8,"We actually did not buy this through Amazon, but got it cheaper from one of our local Christian Book Store, and we are a little upset about this.  Out of the 10 songs on this DVD 6 of them are duplicates from earlier DVD's.  Not only that but ours will not play straight through, we have to select the songs/chapters each and every time.

So if you have the other DVD's from Praise Baby I would NOT recommend this.",1351296000,12,414,4.215189873417722
5200902,5,B0090HR1D8,Bought this for my grand baby. He watches it all the time.,1472083200,,58,3.9166666666666665
5200903,5,B0090HR1D8,Our grandbaby is hooked!,1471824000,,24,5.25
5200904,1,B0090HR1D8,"Doesn't ""play all""
You have to select each song one at a time!",1470787200,,62,3.8461538461538463
5200905,3,B0090HR1D8,I'm giving these DVDs three stars because although my 6 month old zones out and loves them they repeat songs and images if you own all of them.,1470441600,,143,4.142857142857143
5200906,5,B0090HR1D8,"My children have all loved the Praise Baby Series. Forever Reign includes some new songs and familiar ones from ""Born To Worship"".",1460505600,,130,4.954545454545454
5200907,5,B0090HR1D8,My granddaughter could not take her eyes off this DVD - totally focused & smiling at the age of 12 months.,1456963200,,106,4.095238095238095
5200908,5,B0090HR1D8,"This DVD is a miracle. I received it as a gift for my third baby and it calmed her down as early as 6 months old maybe sooner. Better yet, my 18 mo old (who never sits for tv) and my 5 yr old both sit and are hypnotized. (I am too a little). It calms me down SOOO much. I bought 6 of them to hand out as gifts when friends have babies. I have one left to give out. Everyone NEEDS this. It is the only way I got dinner on the table some days. And the price is right.",1453161600,,465,3.5686274509803924
5200909,5,B0090HR1D8,Best DVD`s ever for little children!,1445212800,,36,5.166666666666667
5200910,2,B0090HR1D8,"I love the Praise Baby Collection, but was disappointed that this DVD had 3 identical songs to the God of Wonders DVD. My child had watched the God of Wonders DVD so many times, that I was excited to give him something new to learn.to my disappointment, they were very similar! Even some of the images were identical.",1441584000,,317,4.482758620689655
5200911,5,B0090HR1D8,"My daughter absolutely loved these from about 8mo and up. She's 2, and still loves them. ALL of them!! Had to get them all!",1437609600,,123,4.166666666666667
5200912,1,B0090HR1D8,Disappointed!!  Too many repeat songs. Not sure why they would do that. We were so excited to get this new dvd and couldn't wait to play it. We've been watching all the other DVDs over and over for years. Then as we watched Forever Reign I was so  disappointed when a couple of new songs came on but a lot of it was my old DVDs copied onto this new one with a few new songs. Why?  They should explain that on the cover!!,1433721600,2,420,3.9761904761904763

5200916,5,B0090HR1D8,This collection is a blessing. My son loves them. Everyone in the house hums to the songs. I bought a gift for a neighbour's child and the love it. They inquired where to buy other verions.,1419811200,,189,4.277777777777778
5200917,5,B0090HR1D8,Huge fans of Praise Baby DVD's in this house! We have 3 copies. I wanna get them all.,1416355200,,85,3.7777777777777777

5200919,5,B0090HR1D8,My 2 year-old grandson loves this DVD.  He listens to it over and over again. It's a blessing to me and him.  RD in New York,1407024000,,124,3.730769230769231
5200920,5,B0090HR1D8,"My little girl has been listening to Praise Baby Videos for the past 10 years! When we are away on vacation, I play them for her to help her feel more secure (she has autism). When we visit Grama's house, Grama always requests that we play them on their BIG screne TV! :) They fill the home with a peaceful atmosphere and the the graphics are really Great too!",1397433600,,360,4.231884057971015
5200921,5,B0090HR1D8,"My 10 month old LOVES this DVD! If it's your first of this series, it's not a big deal that some of the songs are repeats. My daughter doesn't care :)",1396137600,,150,3.870967741935484
5200922,1,B0090HR1D8,"The DVD is great. The Songs are wonderfully made and chosen. The images are mostly recycled on this one from the other 5 (we have them all, so I know), BUT the one star is because my DVD came not functioning and the seller didn't replace it. It only plays the songs one at a time. I don't have time to sit there and keep pressing play etc.

Thankfully I have the other 5. I love Praise Baby. Wish this had worked!!!",1391558400,,415,4.060975609756097
5200923,5,B0090HR1D8,"I love these praise baby DVD's!
Enjoy them with my grand babies when they spend the night or need extra comfort. Even the little ones need food for their soul. The songs are familiar, the images colorful and delightful. Real people, children, babies!
JOY Warm LOVE",1390867200,,264,4.760869565217392
5200924,5,B0090HR1D8,"My daughter absolutely loves all of the praise baby DVDs--they are calming, educational, and my daughters' favorite ""movies"" of all time! (she has enjoyed these since she was 3 months old and she is 22 months now).I would highly recommend all praise baby movies!",1388880000,,262,4.9772727272727275
5200925,1,B0090HR1D8,"If you already have any Praise Baby DVD's, you don't need it. If you are just starting your collection, get Born to Worship instead - at least you'll get the full screen. We had two DVD's from the collection already, but this was just lazy editing to copy and paste the songs from previous videos. Extremely disappointed, and won't be adding to my collection in the future.",1388188800,,373,4.582089552238806
5200926,5,B0090HR1D8,"These DVD's are amazing.  I have bought the set for all my grandkids.  They are gentle to listen to, soft sounds yet the message is clear.",1379289600,,138,4.269230769230769
5200927,5,B0090HR1D8,"I really like the fact that the characters/items/graphics move at a nice pace.  I get tired of all of the fast movement in movies (even ones for small children!).  My 2 year old never tires of watching these.  He loves naming the shapes and animals over and over.  If I am busy in the kitchen, I can still enjoy the music while he watches, also! :)
Thank you for putting out a great product.",1377907200,,391,4.243243243243243
5200928,2,B0090HR1D8,My 15 month old daughter loves watching the other Praise Baby DVDs. This one is mostly duplicates from previous DVDs--what a disappointment!,1367280000,2,140,5.409090909090909
5200929,2,B0090HR1D8,"My kids have always loved the Praise Baby dvds, but this is the first one I am very disappointed in.  I would give it four stars except it's only three new songs followed by seven from other dvd's, and since we own the others, this seems quite a cheat.  And maybe it's just me, but the overall quality doesn't seem to be as good as the older dvd's.  If you're looking to try one out, I would definitely suggest purchasing any of the older ones--""God of Wonders,"" ""Praises and Smiles,"" ""Born to Worship,"" etc.  Also, this dvd doesn't have the option of kids vocals, which is what we prefer.",1365120000,3,589,4.376146788990826
5200930,5,B0090HR1D8,"Great baby shows :) My 15 month old daughter loves them! They are a lot like baby Einstein just with popular Christian music in the background which is great because it is edifying for me at the same time as it is teaching and entertaining her :) You also have the choice of selecting a adult singer, children singing or just instrumental which is neat cause you can switch it up. Good quality music and vocals and a great price too! I got them brand new for the same price as used and free super saver shipping :) nice! Would recommend to anyone who likes good praise music and have a baby. The case says it's for children 1 to 3 years but I think babies younger would like it too. Great product overall!",1363737600,,705,4.268656716417911
5200931,5,B0090HR1D8,We have six grandkids and everyone of them have been comforted and mesmerized by the colors and sounds of the worship songs. I like the option to have kids voices singing or adults.,1361145600,,181,4.515151515151516
8533270,5,B0090HR1D8,"Heartfelt worship for babies, older kids and even adults will love this. Feeding your baby's spiritual life with auditory and visual stimulation. What a blessing :)",1528588800,,164,5.346153846153846
8533271,5,B0090HR1D8,This was a great price and it plays great. The visuals are simple but then they are for babies so I am not the desired audience. I like the audio a lot.,1522972800,,152,3.78125
8533272,5,B0090HR1D8,My kid is 10. Still loves to put it on at bed time. I buy one for every baby shower because i want every kid to have this,1513814400,,121,3.357142857142857
8533273,5,B0090HR1D8,"Purchased for our church nursery.  A wonderful way to introduce the little ones to praise and worship!  They're captivated by the colors and pictures on the video which change often enough to keep their attention.  Great product, we now have all in this series!  Highly recommend it for home as well.",1510185600,,300,4.823529411764706
8533274,5,B0090HR1D8,"We love these videos so much.  Only the first 3 songs on this DVD are new - the rest are on other videos.  But that being said, they are some of our favorite songs from the other videos, so the kids don't even mind.  And we love the first 3 songs so much that it made the DVD worth it anyway.  Can't go wrong with Praise Baby!",1486684800,,326,3.8208955223880596
8533275,4,B0090HR1D8,"I love these videos and so do my 6 month grandsons!  This particular one however, has some duplicates from the God of Wonders title, which I wasn't aware of.  Still a good video.",1485820800,,178,4.363636363636363
8533276,5,B0090HR1D8,"Wonderful selection of music. This is my favorite, of the 5 Praise Baby discs I own.",1480723200,,84,4.3125
8533277,5,B0090HR1D8,My question year old LOVES this! We have to watch every day and this is the only video he will literally stop what he's doing and watch and smile ,1476057600,,146,4.0344827586206895
8533278,5,B0090HR1D8,Baby loves it - only negative thing I can say about it is that it is not long enough. The songs and play thru very quickly.,1475452800,,123,3.769230769230769
