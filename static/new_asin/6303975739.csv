Very fundamental techniques for obtaining the proper sounds are covered and the instruction progresses to examples of advanced ensemble playing. The fundamentals are stressed, and you are provided with the examples of Olatunji's own demonstrations along with two of his long-time Drums of Passion members, Sikiru Adepoju and Sanga Francis. Since Olatunji has passed on this is the closest you will get to having a personal lesson from him now.
