8201402,2,B000RMJ5Q6,"I was not too fond of this purchase.  While some of the train scenes were o.k., there could have been much more scenery from the train.  I had trouble understanding why some of the footage in a train dvd was included, such as a longer camera shot of work on a fishing boat, and one of bag pipe playing.  Also too many track only scenes.
Some things left out that could have been included and made it better, were; mention of the name of some of the places they showed (some they did, some they didn't name), and one time they raised my interest in a private train journey, and then didn't show any of that journey that sounded so great.",1491436800,,636,4.239669421487603

8201405,5,B000RMJ5Q6,"Out of all the Great Railroad Adventures, I liked this one the best.
The DVD was low priced and sometimes I have wondered if I would get
a really good one.  This one is a really good one. The scenary in
Scotland and Ireland is breathtaking especially Scotland. The train ride
was  one I would really like to take but is very expensive all the
way. Ireland is such a beautiful country of hills and dales, it is hard
to imagine the strife going on for what seems like forever between
the Brits and the Irish.",1190764800,5,506,4.260416666666667
