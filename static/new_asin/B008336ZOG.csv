8524282,1,B008336ZOG,This movie was made in 70 mm wide screen format. The DVD has it in 4:3 format. The print is inexcusably bad and sound is worse. This DVD does a great disservice to one of the greatest hindi movies ever made. Amazon should just kick this seller out of their eco-system.,1483833600,3,268,4.2745098039215685
8524283,1,B008336ZOG,"First of all, the fact that this is billed as ""remastered"" is a joke. I bought this because I thought the picture quality on the Eros copy was bad. Well, not only is the picture on this one just as bad (if not worse), but they added their company's logo in the top left corner. This DVD looks like you're playing a downloaded copy off of a flashdrive. The logo on top is absolutely inexcusable. Honestly, because at this point it seems impossible to get a great looking copy of Sholay, one of the most popular Bollywood films of all time, you might as well just stick with the Eros version and avoid this monstrosity like the plague. There is NO reason to pay this much money for garbage.",1365292800,9,688,4.341085271317829
