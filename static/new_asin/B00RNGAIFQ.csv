8695590,5,B00RNGAIFQ,"Rosa is a clear and patient teacher. She offers concepts that enhance a dancer's presence -- and help avoid the phenomenon she describes as ""turbo dancing."" People who purchase this DVD can expect to make great strides with their musicality and dynamics. If grace, lines and nuance of movement appeal to you, this is a great buy.",1440460800,3,329,4.7894736842105265
8695591,5,B00RNGAIFQ,"I am a professional dancer and teacher with 14 years of dance experience.  This DVD/CD set is worth the price for the CD alone, which provides descriptions and demonstrations of Arabic rhythms and a full drum solo, expertly played by Jonatan Derbaq. The CD is a great resource for teachers in the studio and students at home that wish to work with a specific rhythm or work on specific moves at a steady pace to a specific rhythm.  Also, it's FANTASTIC FOR PRACTICING ZILLS/SAGAT!

The DVD is divided by chapters, including an introduction, a demonstration of types of pauses and how to incorporate feeling and breath into them, and then demonstrations of the pause options, combos, and improv drills.  The demonstrations can be played with or without voice instruction.  The viewer can select a specific rhythm or play all of the music-only demonstrations in sequence.  This is great because it allows the dancer to follow along in a ""see-and-do"" after she is familiar with the breakdown, and it's like Rosa is leading you in a private class!

If there was anything that was a slight (ever so slight) miss for me, it was the bonus performance. The performance is of Rosa performing with a 3 piece live band, Zapion, which consists of a kanoun, clarinet, and doumbek. The performance itself and the music were lovely, and Rosa is a beautiful dancer.  However, I wish that the performance was of the full drum solo on the CD that is named for her, or an improvised performance by Rosa and Jonatan together.  I know that the two have worked together at festivals previously, but I think when it came to making the CD/DVD, Rosa was in Maine and Jonatan was in Tennessee, and so a performance together wasn't possible.

I would certainly recommend this set for advanced to professional level dancers and teachers.  Since a good deal of the DVD is improvisation that is ""structured"" within breath and pause exercises, dancers that have experience with improvisation and dancers that have taken classes and are comfortable with the basic moves and nomenclature of belly dance will benefit the most from this set.",1434672000,6,2106,4.838440111420613
