8663057,5,B00L16P2AK,Sabrina has changed a lot since her original 1970s cartoon series based on her being a full witch in her original appearances in Archie comics but each Sabrina version is unique and special but still at heart has the elements that make Sabrina character what she is.  This particular movie takes the three episodes from season 1 that deals with Harvey's new curse of being a werewolf without being a ware of it and having to have Sabrina watch over him ever full moon.  Had wish that the Valentine Day episode which also brought up the fact that Harvey a were wolf but didn't have him transform could of been on it but wasn't. This version both parents are dead which makes her living with her Aunts make more sense that say Sabrina The Animated Series had and has made her a princess destined to rule Witch World.  So the current  leader wants her to choose witch world over human world when she grows up so she can make Sabrina her puppet ruler with Enchantra pulling her strings.,1412121600,2,982,4.5
