2301498,2,B0009MDPTM,"This 1978 TV production gives an overview of the exhibition of treasures from the young pharao's tomb that was on a world tour at the time. The treasures are as impressive now as they were then. The picture quality, however, is no better than VHS. No attempt at restauration or enhancement seems to have been made. Even if your interest in King Tut is high you should think before buying.",1125014400,13,388,4.557142857142857

8063309,3,B0009MDPTM,"The artifacts shown are exquisite, and if that is all you're interested in, this is a fine DVD. Although Orson Welles is a great actor, he is a great snooze on this DVD.  His narration and pace is very boring.",1362182400,,209,4.225
8063310,3,B0009MDPTM,"This DVD was purchased for research, as my Halloween costume was King Tut.  The narrator, Orson Welles, seems overly dramatic and the quality of the film did not meet my expectations.  I would have liked more hi def visuals and even more up-to-date knowledge of Tutankhamun and the Royal family, which has been recently published through National Geographic magazine.",1358208000,,367,5.203389830508475
8063311,5,B0009MDPTM,An excellent video for those who want a lot of good shots of many of the amazing artifacts found in King Tut's tomb. One of the special features updates the movie by discussing the CAT scan done of the mummy.,1232755200,2,208,4.225
