1830005,2,B00008975Y,"THE HOUSE OF THE LAUGHING WINDOWS
[La Casa dalle Finestre che Ridono]

(Italy - 1976)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

A young artist (Lino Capolicchio) is summoned to a church in a remote Italian village to restore a crumbling fresco depicting the horrific martyrdom of St. Sebastian. But the man who originally painted the fresco - long believed dead - appears to have been psychologically disturbed, and Capolicchio stumbles on a murderous secret concealed by powerful factions within the village itself...

Long unavailable outside Italy, and highlighted by a glowing review in Phil Hardy's seminal reference work 'The Aurum Film Encyclopedia Horror' (published as 'The Overlook Film Encyclopedia Horror' in America), Pupi Avati's THE HOUSE OF THE LAUGHING WINDOWS was recently restored for its European DVD premiere, and it's that print which forms the centerpiece of Image's US disc. However, despite its reputation as an undiscovered classic, the film is a huge disappointment, a horror movie for people who don't really like horror movies, directed by an acclaimed filmmaker whose early work routinely embraced elements of fantasy and horror (BALSAMUS: L'UOMO DI SATANA, THOMAS E GLI INDEMONIATI, ZEDER, etc.) before he abandoned the genre and dedicated himself to the successful pursuit of 'upmarket' material (NOI TRE, STORIA DI RAGAZZI E DI RAGAZZE, BIX, etc.).

Photographed by regular Avati collaborator Pasquale Rachini on bleak but picturesque Italian locations, the film strives to evoke an atmosphere of dread through languid pacing and deliberate camera movements, but poor post-synch Italian dubbing and weak performances by most of the supporting cast makes it difficult for viewers to engage with the narrative's emotional dynamic (when a number of major players are killed toward the end of the film, the effect is almost negligible). The climactic sequences contain a number of genuine surprises, but the build-up leaves much to be desired, and Avati's creative ambitions are scuppered by funereal pacing and a lack of interesting characters. There's no nudity and very little gore, and consequently, no suspense. Too commercial for the Art-house crowd and too pretentious for trash aficionados, THE HOUSE OF THE LAUGHING WINDOWS fails on all counts, and barely warrants a second glance. Those who prefer the likes of DON'T LOOK NOW to THE TOOLBOX MURDERS (for example) may enjoy it, but everyone else will be bored rigid by this unremarkable potboiler.

NB. While the DVD packaging describes it as 'The House With Laughing Windows', the subtitles on the print itself identifies the film as THE HOUSE OF THE LAUGHING WINDOWS.",1050451200,10,2666,5.366028708133971
1830006,4,B00008975Y,"I put this on at two in the morning after work one night and sat through it (and the subtitles) with nary a yawn... and was quite creeped out by the end credits.  It has everything that makes a great giallo- intriguing camera shots, a plot that ravels itself back together in the last few minutes, picaresque locations populated by physically and emotionally twisted subcharacters (and I thought America had cornered the market on twisted rednecks- Get a load of the altar boy!).  An artist on a restoration project begins recieving death threats and investigates further after a friend gets pushed from his window, leading to a reel tape of the artist (not a spoiler- it's in the opening credits) describing his flesh tortured in conjunction with his art (how pomo).  Kudos to Image for releasing this film undubbed because you'd miss out on the eerie flavor of the phone calls and that reel tape - probably the creepiest tape used in a film after the opening credits of ""Klute"".  On a technical note, remember to click in the subtitles option before viewing the film, and don't watch the making of until after the movie - it has spoilers.  You may need to watch it after anyway, just to have a better transition to shutting off the t.v. in a dark house!  So, overall, one of the more plot oriented giallos that still can carry itself into suspension of disbelief, and with very little lost relevancy.",1049241600,15,1402,4.678861788617886
1830027,3,B00008975Y,"This is an original Italian piece. The story develops in a giallo format, but ends in a more gothic style. By the way, the end is a bit disappointing though. The movie is nicely shot on some Italian coutry location, the wideangle use of the camera is very well achieved. The digital transfer is very good, with vivid colors and a nice defintion. It comes with its original Italian sound and English subtitles. Overall, and considering the its price, an interesting title that mixes a giallo style story with some gothic touches, including the ending. Note, however, that this is not for those expecting lots of nudity and blood.",1228521600,6,628,4.770642201834862
1830028,4,B00008975Y,"This movie is a great movie.
the acting is great and the story is well done.
I won't go into details as there are alot of other reviews that do that.
In fact those reviews convinced me to buy this as I knew it was more of a
moody horror movie than a standard giallo.  It's both for sure and this movie really excells at creating a realistic and gothic feeling of doom. The town is fading away , the people are complacent and they have  allowed a great evil to pollute their lives for decades. Like the people who live in nieghorhoods with trash laying all around the stink of moral rot is prevelant.  The music too  sets the stage and is a great part of why the mood is so oppressive, this movie is for those who want a thinking person's horror movie or giallo that doesn't feature close up gory killings and a super fast pace that ruins so many modern movies. They have there place but they can't feature the type of intense story driven horror that is apparent here.  The print is fantastic , whenever I buy a image released dvd flick I always hope they did a good job with the print and too often it looks like crap; but this time they did it right.  This is remastered and brilliant.  This is what they need to do with every movie from now on.  If you like somber deep mysteries that give you a  payoff at the end of the movie and don't expect  a happy ending like the ones that are frequently tacked on to hollywood movies when they shouldn't be there, then you will enjoy this gothic cult classic.
And many film critics since 1976 have given this movie high marks not just we  horror fans who have our own system of rating the genre.",1226620800,,1639,4.204472843450479
1830029,3,B00008975Y,"Antonio, recently reacquainted with his friend Stefano who has come to renovate a fresco in the local church depicting the Martyrdom of St Sebastian, has discovered something he shouldn't. Something is rotten in the Italian backwater, but before he can divulge his suspicions he finds himself on the wrong side of a top floor window and plummets to his death while a shadow lurks behind the curtains. So far, so giallo. The gruesome work of art is apparently key to uncovering some secret harboured by the town's residents, so the bulk of the film is then devoted to delving into the bloody back-story of the deceased Artist and his two insane sisters. The main problem here is that the film finds the central mystery much more mysterious than it actually is, and doesn't seem to realise it's given most of the details away. As the Painter's story unfolds - murky as it is - the important stuff (that the gruesome acts depicted in the artist's work might be real) is either implied by the promotional blurb, the opening credits sequence or already anticipated by our over-active imaginations.

What the film sorely needs in the absence of any real action is some clarification as to what it is we're actually supposed to be intrigued by while we wait for the body count to rise. There is a throwaway line later in the film which goes a long way to informing the story as a whole, and cements in our minds the very real danger at hand, but it comes a bit late in the day. Used earlier it would have given Stefano's amateur sleuthing some much needed impetus (Antonio's is too mundane and isolated a death and seems forgotten almost immediately). What lies at the heart of the film then, once the back-story has been told (and after a lot of to-ing and fro-ing) is Stefano's failure to deduce the identity of the sisters (in particular the second sister) and the consequences therein. So everything depends on the final reveal. These are obviously characters we've already met - that's how these things work - but a real rapport needed to be established between Stefano and the peripheral players to give the nature of the revelation (which has been sketchily sign-posted) a much greater emotional punch when it comes. As a result the effect is diluted. Ultimately the biggest mystery is why the town is keeping its secrets in the first place.

On the plus side, coupled with the brooding atmospherics, it is lovely to look at. The camera work isn't overly elaborate but understated works in the film's favour. There are some nice shots - one in particular where Stefano walks round the side of a house with his back to it, so we discover, a moment before he does, that the title isn't simply a metaphor. A palette of greys and smoky blues blends with the thin winter light, with sparing splashes of crimson and orange ochre (emulating the look of Hitchcock's Frenzy). The artist's monologue which accompanies a retrospective sepia-tinged slaughter during the opening credits and used again later on is effectively lurid (you'll need a shower afterwards, followed by dinner and flowers) and the full extent of one haunted local's involvement with the mysterious trio some thirty-odd years earlier lends the film some much needed emotional resonance. Most of all Avati deserves credit for the St Sebastian reference. It seems a pretty innocuous stylistic choice, but there is a significance here which, though not essential, provides one of the true, subtle revelations of the entire film. Provided you put two and two together and know your saints.

The House with Laughing Windows was for so long the 'lost giallo' and consequently it seems a bit of giallo envy has bolstered its reputation as a forgotten masterpiece. In terms of pure filmmaking that's short of the mark. There are too many uneven moments. Characters disappear ominously, then reappear without acknowledgement. Things go bump in the night which we discover second hand rather than getting to witness, and there's a curious did they/didn't they? (do it) tryst between Stefano and the town's departing school teacher (if they did he apparently likes to keep not only his socks on but his entire dapper three-piece). That isn't to say it's a total bomb by any means either. It depends how invested you find yourself in the Painter's story, and to some extent how prepared you are to suspend disbelief. If you approach with expectations suitably tempered it'll probably do the business. Just sit back and soak up the quietly unsettling atmosphere without thinking too much, but be warned, a great time is not assured.

1830030,4,B00008975Y,"This is an above average Italian murder mystery that eschews all the usual giallo conventions (black gloved killers, over-use of subjective camera perspectives, and style over substance) in favour of an intricate, well constructed and most importantly logically cohesive narrative; simply put the film makes sense. Much of the pleasure from giallo is derived from this dream logic, but director Pupi Avati avoids potential boredom and failure, by creating a polarisation between city and country. One of the messages of the film, of which there are many, is to be weary and very cautious when in a rural, provincial part of Italy. Such binaries were not uncommon in the 1970's in many cultures, one only has too look to ""Deliverance"". However what makes Avati's vision more disturbing is the uncompromising assault on both art and religion. Art is provided for the benefit of culture, yet here it is the harbinger of sadistic torture, the institution of religion is concomitant to the sadism rendered through the process of artistic endeavour, they are bedfellows feeding off one another in this backwater setting. I'm fairly certain there is also an allegorical level to this film, both in the city/country dichotomy, but also in the art/religion dichotomy and its associations with brutality. This film is that rare thing, an Italian genre film with depth and intelligence.",1171411200,,1375,5.198198198198198
1830031,4,B00008975Y,"I will start by saying that one of my guilty pleasure is a good Giallo, and ""The House with Laughing Windows"" is a good example of a well made giallo.

It is not your everyday giallo, that stick exactly to the genere rules, but it got some very good mood and it is very frightning experience.

It is not a gory giallo, but more psychological and athmospheric movie. The music score is fantastic and go along with the movie wounderfully.

I like the first scene when the partagonist is arriving to the shore with a boat and a car is waiting on the shore. This scene is so captivating going along with hunting music.

During watching it It reminds me Dario Argento ""Deep Red"". I must say that both movies gave me the shivers.

After watching ""The House with Laughing Windows"" you will surly going to have a very disturbing and frighting experience, and the movie theme will stay in your mind for long time.

If a good giallo is your cup of tea, then you cannot miss this one, it is a must!!",1135987200,2,988,4.342391304347826
1830032,4,B00008975Y,A very interesting plot and some good casting (alter boy especially). A unique plot and good camera-work make this Giallo one to see for sure.,1129680000,2,142,4.72
1830033,4,B00008975Y,"I saw this movie on something of a whim.  I just came across it kinda randomly while looking around at some other Italian stuff, thought it had an intriguing title, read the plot description and thought it sounded pretty interesting and just checked it out.  'The House with Laughing Windows' is pretty good stuff.  It isn't as stylized as most of the other Italian horror films that  I've seen, but it's definitely got a more interesting plot than any other one that I can think of. (Which is small praise in and of itself, I'll admit.)  As it turns out, the premise is more intriguing than were it actually ends up, so I dunno how well it would hold up under repeated viewings, but it's definitely worth seeing once, for those who are interested in this sort of thing.

In `The House with Laughing Windows' Stefano comes to a small Italian village were he is to restore a gruesome fresco depicting the martyrdom of St. Sebastian.  While there, it becomes apparent that someone doesn't want him to be there, as he receives mysterious phone calls.  The painter of the fresco, Legnani, was widely considered mad, and was even suspected of murder, as some corpses were eventually found near his home, the titular house.  That's about all can give away of the plot.  That's an interesting premise, I think, but the film doesn't really take it anywhere all that exciting or surprising.  Still, the plot is fairly intriguing, and it's got other things going for it.

Though it not as stylish as lots of these sorts of films, the movie is quite effectively atmospheric.  Perhaps most notably, it takes place in a small, distinctly european village.  I dunno why, but small, villages are a whole lot creepier than large cities.  The setting is particularly strong as it is simultaneously quaint and picturesque while still not seeming entirely right or normal.  The old mansion which Stefano stays in is quite creepy, as they so often are, and the titular house is pretty cool too, though we don't see it all that much.  As others have mentioned, a tape of Legnani madly ruminating over his work is really quite unnerving, definitely one of the most effective things in the film.  Some will likely find it overdone, but I like it. There is some effective imagery, particularly the scene displayed on the cover, though the direction and cinematography are occasionally a little too flat and conventional, seeming almost like something off of TV rather than film.  Finally, the dark secret of Legnani's family's past, while not at all unexpected, is quite creepy in concept.  Unfortunately, the frescos and other pieces of art that he supposedly made are generally a little chintzy, which cuts down on the effectiveness of the  whole thing a bit.  Not a whole helluva lot, for sure, but some.

The film has a twist ending which is frankly a bit nonsensical, and it doesn't really mean or suggest a whole helluva lot, but it's a passable enough way to end the film, I suppose.  It doesn't add much, but it doesn't really take anything away either.

The DVD is alright.  It certainly doesn't look anywhere  near as good as most of the more famous Anchor Bay DVD's, but it looks better than most DVD's you will find for films that are this obscure.  It's subtitled, rather than dubbed, and they are done fairly well, for the most part.  It is occasionally a bit awkward, and never terribly elegant, but you'll doubtless have seen worse.

Yep, this is an interesting film.  Not too much happens, but it's intriguing and sufficiently creepy, which makes it more than worthwhile for Italian horror fans.",1109980800,,3588,4.747980613893376

This is a very good film directed by the man who also did ""Zeder: Voices of the Dead"". Although similar in tone, this film explores a man's quest to solve an illogical mystery and it is more provincial thus regulating us to the ominous and desolate village landscape, such as the canal, the empty houses and the isolated stretches of land. The man in question is an art restorer who is called to the small village of Palerma Southern Italy to restore a fresco painted by a degenerate artist. As he is led by the hunchback dwarf mayor, the man begins to assume a mysterious air about him, namely that people are hiding something in the village. His suspicion is further activated when he finds that the artist who painted the scene in the old church, was a maniac and pervert. More and more he uncovers strange rumors and ghastly pieces of evidence, including a dicto-graph voice tape and a journal from the 1930's. His visit to the old house where the artist lived uncovers peculiar mouths painted on the windows. There are also two eerie sisters who contributed to the artist's suicide and they were followers of a reclusive cult that was situated in South America. Most of the film has a sense of unnerving atmosphere and it is very unusual and pleasant to learn that one does not know what premise will be laid out next. The ending was a surprise because one can only assume what occurred.",1101945600,2,1416,4.619047619047619
1830035,4,B00008975Y,"I watched Pupi Avati's ""Zeder"" before seeing ""The House of the Laughing Windows"" and was decidedly indifferent to the overall impact of the former. Sure, you have an original idea about a hidden message on a typewriter ribbon, a few gore scenes, and an occasionally creepy series of events. But ""Zeder"" as a whole was an excellent idea poorly executed. I found ""House"" to be a better movie overall, with an even creepier series of events, an interesting and complex plot, and a truly shocking conclusion. The movie even looks better than ""Zeder,"" although that might have something to do with the DVD transfer and the fact that ""House"" is a feature film whereas ""Zeder"" was a made for Italian television. Still, we should commend Avati because both films transcend the usually vapid world of Italian cinema. There's Argento, who always does a good job, and Lucio Fulci, who rarely does a good job but who used imaginative gore effects break taboos, but most movies arriving here from the boot reek. It's too bad we haven't seen more from Pupi Avati in recent years. I have no idea if he is still making horror movies. He is probably working on Italian soap operas or some other mind deadening television project.
""The House of the Laughing Windows"" centers on a painting in a church in the little village of St. Sebastian. This objet d'art is frightful looking thing mercifully unfinished by its deceased creator, but that doesn't stop a big city restoration expert from rolling into town when he receives an offer to clean the painting up. The priest at the church is nice enough to him, but the townspeople are downright hostile concerning this guy's presence. Only a female teacher in the village acts friendly towards the young man--real friendly, by the way--because she too is an outsider. The residents so despise his presence that someone sneaks into the church and vandalizes the painting, thereby destroying all of the progress made on it. Being a sort of curious type--I guess you would need to be if you wanted to restore ancient paintings--the man begins to investigate his surroundings and the history of the painting. He soon discovers more than he ever wanted to know about this odd little town and its frightened denizens. With the help of an alcoholic village outcast, he slowly unearths the grim story behind the painting as well as discovering the reason people do not want him to proceed with his work. The final scenes of the film show our restorer in serious trouble as he comes face to face with the meaning of the painting and the inspiration for its horrific creation.
""House of the Laughing Windows"" possesses some imagery sure to deliver the chills. The painting sits looms over the proceedings like a dark storm cloud. Once you understand the story behind this object, the implications of it are downright deadly. I also enjoyed that creepy tape recording that pops up every now. The barely audible rasping on that tape provides one of the eeriest set pieces in the entire film. Moreover, greatly enjoyable is the uncloaking during the conclusion to the film, when our hero learns the terrible secret of the painting and why the townspeople knew mucking around with the past insures ghastly results. There is, of course, the house with the laughing windows, which serves as a major clue to uncovering the secrets of the painting. The house is a neat, if slightly strange, idea on the part of the director and screenwriter of the film. Throw in an effective soundtrack and ""House of the Laughing Windows"" may well rank as one of the oddest, scariest films to come out of Italy in a long time.
Avati's film does not rank as the best horror film from Italy, obviously. Mario Bava and Dario Argento have done much better films than ""House."" As good as this movie is, it still shares some flaws with other Italian films. The acting here is mediocre, not a huge shock considering the wooden performances that plague nearly every Italian horror film I have ever seen. The pace of ""House"" tends to grate on the nerves after awhile, too. There must be something in the water over there because anytime a horror movie from Italy runs for almost two hours you are sure to glance at your watch a time or two. The uneven pacing in these types of films often dilutes the impact of the very message the director tries to convey. It's a dilemma for someone like me because I cannot stand to see cut films, but sometimes movies flow better with certain scenes removed. In a perfect world, DVD companies would include a cut and uncut version of the film in order to let the viewer decide which one looks and feels better. I'm dreaming, of course, as only a few companies actually do this. Anyway, a tighter version of ""House"" might alleviate some of the time drag.
The disc presents ""House"" in widescreen, which is always nice. Although the transfer looks a tad soft in places, I thought the quality rated better than good. A nonsensical trailer on the disc gives you little idea of what the film is about, but is still intriguing nonetheless. Also thrown into the package is an interview with Pupi Avati and a few of the principals involved in the movie. This helpful extra gives you a little information about the film and what the creators hoped to accomplish with it, as well as how they feel about the movie twenty plus years after its initial release. I recommend ""House"" for all lovers of shriek cinema; it is a cracking good film with a conclusion that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",1072656000,,5519,4.708376421923474

7980128,4,B00008975Y,"""La casa dalle finestre che ridono"" (""The House of the Laughing Windows"") from 1976 and directed by Pupi Avati, was not in the same league as your basic giallo/horror film - it was better than most! Pupi Avati ("" Storia di ragazzi e di ragazze"" 1989, ""Il cuore altrove"" 2003) is basically a filmmaker of the art-house variety. And for that reason this film falls in between the two aforementioned categories (just like Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"" 1973, for that matter). It had a fine actor in Lino Capolicchio (""Il giardino dei finzi Contini"" 1970) and Francesca Marciano (""Pasqualino settebellezze"" 1975, she had a very brief acting career, but became an accomplished screenwriter ""Io non ho paura"" 2003). The cinematography alone sets this one apart from other gialli and the story was also very original and a shocking one at that! I am not going to get into the plot, as many reviewers have given exhaustive detail already. For the most part I am not a big fan of horror-films per se, but I am a fan of films that are intelligent and well-made (with the exception of the sex-comedies that I'm infatuated with), regardless of their genre. This film merited that distinction. And it really was a little frightening in places, but without the gimmicks and devices of the lowbrow-horror subgenre. If you like films that don't give everything away, and keep you in suspense til the very end, then this one is for you. The film has been beautifully restored for this DVD release by Image Entertainment, as part of their ""EuroShock Collection"".

7980129,4,B00008975Y,"A small Italian village is haunted by memories of a local artist whose fresco depicting the martyrdom of St. Sebastian reflects his morbid obsession with death and violence.  The villagers whisper uneasily that the artist tortured and murdered his models, depositing their bodies in shallow graves in the surrounding countryside.  Pupi Avati's 1976 shocker, ""The House With Laughing Windows"", begins when a young art restorationist, Stefano, arrives at the village church to restore the St. Sebastien fresco. It quickly becomes apparent that someone doesn't want him to finish the job.  Following the apparent ""suicide"" of the friend who recommended him for the project, Stefano starts receiving creepy phone calls.  The schoolteacher, with whom he has a casual relationship, suddenly relinquishes her position only to be immediately replaced by a slightly younger, but very similar, woman; that she winds up taking a similar, but more important, position in Stefano's afffections seems coincidental.  Or is it?  As Stefano discovers, nothing is what it seems in this town, and the consequences of taking things at face value, and trusting the wrong person can have terrifying consequences.

Lino Capolicchio, looking a little like a young Rob Reiner (and probably better known for his turn in ""The Garden of the Finzi Continis""), is very effective as the film's hero, an adventurous young man dedicated to completing the restoration project, even as it appears that it may endanger his life.  Stefano is a well-rounded, believable character who becomes more volatile as the situation around him unravels.  Francesca Marciano is stunning as his love interest, and adds a layer of poignancy to a character who may--or may not--be too good to be true.  The rest of the cast is first rate, all turning in good performances guaranteed to chill you to the bone.

Not a giallo in the true sense of the word, ""The House With Laughing Windows"" builds such a woozy sense of dread that, by the time the unexpected denouement occurs, you're bursting with anticipation.  That denouement is so outrageous, so bug-eyed crazy, that you might think about laughing, but it's actually a pretty good ending, one that plays fair if you've been paying attention, and one that will stay with you.",1317254400,,2274,5.166212534059945

THE HOUSE WITH LAUGHING WINDOWS seemed to be more psychological so I waited for a while to get this one. I'm sorry I waited.

Even the opening credits are creepy as hell. This flick is atmospheric, creepy, mysterious, and intriguing. I know those sound like generic adjectives but... all I can say is that if you enjoy Italian horror, you won't be disappointed. This takes place in rural Italy so you can some nice looking scenery as well.

7980131,3,B00008975Y,"The House with the Laughing Windows (Pupi Avati, 1976)

The opening sequence of La Casa Dalle Finestre che Ridono, Pupi Avati's fifth film and the one that made him a star, does not prepare you for the film that follows it. It's a series of impressionist close-ups of a man being tortures, Inquisition-style, with a rambling, confession-sounding voice-over track. One would be forgiven for expecting that one is going to get a gore-drenched horror film like those Argento was starting to make at the time, rather than the kind of giallo Argento had been making up till then. That is, however, exactly what we get, and while there are some supernatural elements to the film, they tend to be low-key and stay in the background most of the time; this is a straight mystery about a mysterious disappearance, the attempt to keep that disappearance mysterious, and art history. (You'd be surprised at how many gialli have art history wandering around in them somewhere. I have.)

Stefano (Lino Cappolichio, who when not starring in half the gialli made in the seventies, was busy making little obscure flicks like The Garden of the Finzi-Continis with de Sica) is a young, enthusiastic art restorer who is hired to clean up a mural in a rural church. Upon his first inspection, he's not overly impressed with it, but then he starts looking closer. It's a Bruno Legnani! Not only that, it's a huge Bruno Legnani, and it has as its subject matter the torture of Saint Sebastian! Ah, now all the sudden the opening sequence comes clear... Legnani is imagining as he paints, and the rambling stuff about colors is his voice. Except there seems to be more to it than that. Legnani, while a famous artist, is one about whom very little is known. He was local to Palermo, though, and in fact Stefano is staying at the house of his spinster sisters, both of whom seem slightly mad. The more Stefano pokes around trying to find out about the mural--the last work Legnani did before disappearing--the more he hears about Legnani being somewhat cracked. When he starts hearing stories about how the man preferred painting from life, Stefano starts to wonder a lot more about the mural he's restoring...

If you've seen Avati's films before (and if you haven't, do so at your earliest convenience; he's one of the most consistent, if unheralded, Italian directors working today), you'll have an idea of what's coming; this is low-key stuff, in general, though this film is quite a bit splashier than most of the Avati movies I've seen. Because of that, it tends to feel more like a typical giallo and less like an Avati film, but there's no denying it's an effective giallo; the mystery angle is solid, if the resolution stretches credibility, and it's perfectly shot to keep the viewer just a little off-kilter for most of the movie. Solid, if not exceptional, work from an Italian master. ***",1293062400,,2876,4.782696177062374

Pupi Avati's THE HOUSE WITH LAUGHING WINDOWS is a stylish and tasteful thriller that breaks away from the standard conventions of the Italian Giallo, relying on the suspense and mystery of the intricately designed plot over the shocking gore and violent murders that frequented similar films in the genre. It also avoids the often contrived and convoluted story elements found in many weaker Gialli of the time. Lino Capolicchio is very convincing as the apprehensive lead that is drawn closer to the truth as more of the villagers are found murdered. The twisted religious subtext adds an additional level of fright to the picture that plays on the small town convictions of an isolated community. What sets the film apart more than anything else are the beautifully photographed authentic Northern Italian locales that set a dreary and atmospheric backdrop to the slowly unraveling plot. THE HOUSE WITH THE LAUGHING WINDOWS is one of the stronger entries in the strictly-Italian sub-genre that has been commonly overlooked by Giallo fans.

this film was ok. It was all about re-painting this picture in a church that may have been based on real life murders. It was a little slow at times but i did enjoy it. I got a little confused here and there but i'd watch the film again.",1280016000,,414,3.7045454545454546
7980134,4,B00008975Y,"The thing that works against a lot of foreign movies of this type is the background music.  Music creates a mood and in this case, does not work to the movie's advantage.  The movie starts of slowly but held my interest, particularly due to its good revues, as I was anticipating greater things.
The last 1/3 of the movie is worth watching it for.  Gotta love those twists!",1254355200,,373,4.455882352941177
7980135,5,B00008975Y,"Before I review the actual film, allow me to say that Image did an excellent job of restoring ""The House With Laughing Windows"" or else they found an excellent print.  For having been originally released in 1976, the audio and video are superb.  Speaking of audio, it is presented only in Italian with English subtitles.  Perhaps it was never dubbed in English, having never been released in America.  (However, one would think that it would have been dubbed in English for release in Britain.)  The film, as well as the trailer, is presented in widescreen with its original theatrical aspect of 1.85:1.  The trailer does not have English subtitles.  Other special features include an interesting documentary on the making of the film (which now has a cult following), a lobby card gallery, and filmographies of the director and lead actor.

  Directed by Pupi Avati (who co-wrote the screenplay for Lamberto Bava's ""Macabre,"" a.k.a., ""Macabro""), ""The House with Laughing Windows"" is one of the most bizarre Italian gialli I have ever seen.  It has satanic elements and ranks up there with Aldo Lado's ""Short Night of the Glass Dolls"" and Sergio Martino's ""All the Colors of the Dark,"" both of which are equally strange; however, ""The House with Laughing Windows"" is superior.

  Stefano (Lino Capolicchio of Antonio Bido's ""The Blood Stained Shadow"") is hired to restore a church fresco which depicts the brutal stabbing death of St. Sebastain.  He soon learns that the inhabitants of this small island town are a strange lot.  The friend who recommended him for the job falls from Stefano's hotel room window.  Though Stefano insists it was murder, the police rule it a suicide.  Stefano begins investigating the fresco's dead painter Legnani who was known as the Painter of Agony.  His perverse artwork depicted people in pain and suffering and it was rumored that he painted from real life.  As Stefano unravels the secrets of the painting, more of his friends and associates begin to die.

  ""The House with Laughing Windows"" is a creepy, atmospheric gothic horror/giallo.  There are crumbling buildings, swamps, and canals enshrouded in fog; demented characters; disappearing corpses; and a secret burial site.  Like many Italian gialli, the ending is strange, twisted, and perverse; it is rather shocking and unexpected.  Stefano reminds me of Rosemary Woodhouse in ""Rosemary's Baby.""  He too learns that you can't trust those around you.

  ""The House with Laughing Windows"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy Italian gialli or European horror.  I didn't find anything laughable about it.  It would have been more appropriately titled ""The House With Screaming Windows.""  Its victims certainly screamed a lot before dying.

  If you like Italian gialli, I recommend ""Deep Red,"" ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage,"" ""Tenebre,"" ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times,"" ""A Lizard in a Woman's Skin,"" ""Murder Walks on High Heels,"" ""Torso,"" ""The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh,"" ""What Have You Done to Solange?"" and ""Blood and Black Lace.""  I'm addicted to Italian gialli.  I've seen over sixty.",1230163200,2,3095,5.116
