8055032,3,B00080QEYS,"The ""Cartoon Craze"" collections are dollar-jobbers, imported from Taiwan, offering generally cheap prints of (mostly) public domain material. While this volume (Hunky & Spunky - ""You Can't Shoe a Horsefly"") doesn't break the mold entirely, there's some classic animation here you won't find anywhere else.  First & foremost, Pejakovic's ""Once Upon a Time There Was a Dot"" - a work of endless imagination and an irresistibly sunny charm one doesn't normally associate with the Zagreb studio.  Likewise, there's wit and sophistication to be found in UPA's ""The Invisible Moustache of Raoul Dufy"", from the short-lived ""Gerald McBoing Boing Show"", previously available on VHS, but long out of print.  If that's not enough for your dollar, there's also John Hubley's classic ""The Tender Game"" in a much more colorful print than that included on the ""official"" Hubley collection, ""Art & Jazz in Animation"", once available from Image Entertainment. Go figure!  Finally, one should not neglect to mention Bosustow's ""Freedom River"", a still timely political parable, with narration by none other than Orson Welles.  In short, a feast of ""cartoon modern"" (along with some other odds and ends) from a most unlikely source. Grab it while you can.",1180224000,7,1236,5.285714285714286
