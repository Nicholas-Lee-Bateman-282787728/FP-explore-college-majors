6240036,5,B00HWCIOL6,Great series. Girls added fire but the drama was exciting. Obviously Davey Grant was my favourite. What s lovely lad. Little disappointed at the minimal out takes on final disc. Think it could have been loads more entertaining with added fun and  frolics,1416355200,3,254,4.906976744186046

6240044,5,B00HWCIOL6,"The season of TUF 18 made me a MMA and WMMA fan , as well as many people that I know . The key is Ronda , Baby Girl drives the bus , the women fights were also very entertaining and in my opinion one of the draws to the show , and one of the reasons why I purchased the day after it was released .",1398729600,5,297,3.4477611940298507

6240057,4,B00HWCIOL6,"Rousey may have lost a few fans with her immature attitude.
Tate seemed a nice person,good coach.
The girls were a good addition to tuf seasons,good fights.
Go and buy this dvd.",1431648000,3,177,4.5625
6240058,5,B00HWCIOL6,One of the best episodes I've seen from the UFC sports industry. I'm a huge fan of Ronda Rousey so I wasn't expecting any disappointments.,1430870400,,138,4.56

6240061,5,B00HWCIOL6,"I never had a chance to watch this season when it aired. This is the best season of TUF. I have watched it more than once. The Finale was the best I've ever seen. I personally enjoy watching the female fights more than the guys. I have all the respect in the world for these women. Not a fan of Rousey, though. I respect her as a fighter, but not as a person. I speak from my own experience & from what I saw on the show. Miesha Tate is awesome. Every true MMA fan should own this great piece of UFC history.",1422403200,13,508,3.941747572815534
6240062,5,B00HWCIOL6,"I started watching TUF late in the game, but I enjoyed this season especially.  This is the first season with girls in the house. I was really interested in how that dynamic would play out. However, I'm glad I watched this season just to get to know the girls, many of whom are fighting now in the UFC and doing an amazing job.  Finally, the dynamic between Miesha and Rhonda was tense at times, other times absolutely HYSTERICAL!!! Rhonda is so dramatic I couldn't help but laugh. Worth the entertainment!",1419638400,7,506,4.611111111111111

8636883,5,B00HWCIOL6,"Poor Rousey has got some fairly obvious mental health issues. The fights are almost all ultra entertaining, and that's what I was really interested in seeing. Not so much a Ronda fan as I once was. It was a mistake on her part to let the world see the real her.",1474761600,,261,4.137254901960785
