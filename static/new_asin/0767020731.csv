4830,5,0767020731,IMHO this is the best Monty Python episode of all. Wanted to see it again and show it to a friend so bought it on a whim. Probably should just buy the whole series or season.,1354579200,,174,3.861111111111111
4831,5,0767020731,"To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general!
Highlights on this tape: The Ministry Of Silly Walks, The Spanish Inquisition, Flying Lessons/Hijacked Plane (To Luton), 'The Bishop', Accidents Sketch and Registry Office.
Own it!",969926400,2,440,5.125
4832,5,0767020731,"Season 2 of Monty Python is truly the best of all their seasons.  It was here that the boys really hit their stride.  The first season, while quite good, had many moments of awkward silence from an audience that didn't  quite know what to make of the anarchy before them.  The show also looked  cheapand many bits seemed to fall flat.  In the second season, the group  grew better together and came out with some of the funniest and most famous  bits they ever did.  The Spanish Inquisition bit is one of the most popular  and is still hilarious today.  The sight of them rushing on a bus to get to  the studio to deliver their punchline before the credits end is classic.  John Cleese as the Minister for Silly Walks is brilliant in it's lunacy.  To try to introduce the group to America they re-staged some of their best  sketches from Season 2 together under the title ""And Now For Something  Completely Different.""  One of my favorites from this collection  (besides How Not to be Seen) is Cleese's class on How to Defend Yourself  from Someone Who is Attacking You Armed with a Piece of Fresh Fruit.  This  set is a MUST HAVE for all Monty Python fans.",962323200,6,1157,4.440191387559809

7788634,5,0767020731,I love Monte Python!! I bought this as a high school graduation gift for my nephew. It is not made abundantly clear in capital letters bolded and underlined that this DVD is a UK/European formatted disc. Why isn't there a big NOT FOR SALE IN THE USA!!! If this DVD doesn't work in my nephew's made in USA DVR I will be expecting a full credit on my prime account as DVD cost over $50!!!,1435536000,,386,4.16
7788635,5,0767020731,"I think seasons 1 and 2 are the best.  Love the ""dead parrot sketch"".  Monty python is one of those things that you either love it or hate it.  There is no grey area here.  I love the flying circus, however I don't like any of the movies, they are a little to crass.",1376611200,,266,3.8703703703703702
7788636,5,0767020731,"This show is almost an archeological find. I find it as funny now as when I saw it first (guess I,m an archeological find as well). For discerning US viewers I would recommend contrasting it with SNL. Both are excellent but different.",1369440000,,234,4.595238095238095
7788637,3,0767020731,I watched it 30 years ago. It was funny then. I guess my interests have changed. But still a classic.,1368921600,,101,4.1
7788638,5,0767020731,"Monty Python' s Flying Circussss... I basically had no sense of humor when I was a kid; well, I had only a very straight-laced, boring, run-of-the-mill sense of humor.  I credit 3 things for the development of the slightly twisted, off-center sense of humor that I now possess - antidepressants, Peg Bracken's ""I Wouldn't Have Missed It For The World,"" and ""Monty Python's Flying Circus.""  I always assumed that MPFC was just normal British humor, but from what I've read, apparently even the Brits had to acclimate themselves to it a bit.  It's SOOO insane!!!  I can't even properly describe it! If knock-knock jokes are your thing, you WON'T ""get"" MPFC. If you ""get"" (or at least laugh at) Garrison Keillor's classic ""Penguin joke,"" then Monty Python is probably for you! GET IT!!!!!!!",1364169600,,787,4.894736842105263
