8536180,2,B0095IIQ90,"Savannah was an important ship, and it's great that she's been rescued and is being cared for.
I purchased this DVD with the idea of ""going aboard"" and seeing something of the ship, both during her heyday and as she is now. Much of the DVD consists of interviews with former crew. One, in particular, dominates much of the program. The crew are placed in front of the camera and respond to an unseen interviewer's questions. The result often is the dreaded ""talking heads"" syndrome.
Very little of the ship's interior is shown. A simple ""guided tour"" of the ship, from top to bottom, as it was then and as it is now, would have set the stage for the interviews. Most interviews were interesting, but some were rather long-winded and could have used further editing. The efforts to restore the ship could be more clearly and prominently described.
As an historic ship, Savannah deserves a first-rate documentary, and while this video focuses on her crew's experience (certainly a worthy goal), those wishing to see the ship likely will be disappointed.",1362960000,4,1051,4.8121546961325965
