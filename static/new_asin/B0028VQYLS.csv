3874886,5,B0028VQYLS,Wonderful! This is such a great memory of how Liberace played such beautiful music and what a great concert. You feel as if you are at the concert and relive the memories of such a great performer.,1380758400,,197,4.351351351351352
3874887,5,B0028VQYLS,"It's no wonder he was known as ""Mr. Showmanship"".  This TV special offers some of Liberace's best piano playing.  He blends in very well with the London Philharmonic.  Any Liberace fan will be happy with this purchase.",1380153600,,218,4.837837837837838

3874889,5,B0028VQYLS,"Great video of Liberace at his peak. Seeing Liberace live, you gain an understanding of just what a showman he was and how he endeared himself to his audience. I only wish it was a complete recording of the entire London performance. This was a TV special which included many segments from the performance.",1372896000,8,306,4.685185185185185
3874890,3,B0028VQYLS,"Another quickie copy. They could have done better. The original VHS tapes are still better produced. This disc, which has no chapter selections (but you can fast forward) is disappointing. The material is excellent & deserved a better treament.",1370563200,8,244,5.282051282051282
3874891,3,B0028VQYLS,"This is a made-for-TV special of Liberace celebrating 40 years in show-business.  The show itself is fine, but the quality of the recording isn't all that great.  First of all, it was originally recorded on analog video-tape, and has degraded with age before being digitized.  The image is somewhat grainy and has noticeable video bars.  The sound seems to be mono and the fidelity isn't very good, apparently because it was intended to only be broadcast on TV when it was recorded back in 1984. Most of the video was shot from one camera with a side-view of Liberace while at the piano.

The DVD disc itself was not mass-produced like a typical DVD movie.  Instead, it was written onto a DVD-R disc like you might do with your own computer.  Hence it won't last as long.  There are no chapters.  It's about what I would expect from an amateur film company.  One good thing is that it has no copy-protection, so you can easily make a copy if you wish without needing to decrypt it.",1355097600,11,981,4.5227272727272725

8357063,5,B0028VQYLS,This is one of the greatest if not the most entertaining performance of Liberace. A must for anyone's collection of Liberace.,1508112000,,125,5.0
8357064,2,B0028VQYLS,"Please note that my criticism has nothing to do with Liberace, because I absolutely love his music, and I absolutely LOVE his performances here. Rather, the fact that this disc was a DVD-R and not a professionally done silver, pressed DVD as is what you usually get with professional products (which is what I thought I was purchasing because it is on Amazon). Buyer beware and be sure to do your research.",1497744000,,406,4.652777777777778

8357067,4,B0028VQYLS,"Very entertaining but was very disappointed that the DVD varied from the CD in that several parts of the concert were omitted, primarily the part where he played Gershwin. Also the orchestra's directors differed from the DVD and the CD.",1437350400,,236,4.925

8357070,5,B0028VQYLS,What a showman.  Too bad he isn't still with us because he had so much talent.  Very good DVD and a good investment.,1392163200,5,116,4.0
8357071,5,B0028VQYLS,"Back in the day, Liberace performed many concerts in London.  This is one of the better ones, and I would highly recommend it.",1390089600,4,126,4.478260869565218
