1972951,4,B00015HVM4,"When I was 10, I spent summer with my dad in Southern California. He worked for a Taco Bell knock-off called Naugles. I had to stay with him in the restaurant everyday since I could not stay home alone. Naugles was in a shopping center along with a $1.00 movie theater. This particular summer, they were showing Karate Kid 2 and, you guessed it...Space Camp. I would go from movie to movie, back and forth, all day, almost everyday for 2 months.

Anyway, for this Blu-Ray. When they ""upgraded"" this movie for this high definition format, it revealed all the bad video effects. When they are in space scenes with the windows behind them, a yellow blur-blob appears around their heads which is quite distracting. Love the movie, lots of star power in this cheesy 80's movie, but the DVD would probably better because the average special effects would be hidden behind the lower resolution copy. It doesn't help that NASA has been proven false by faking moon missions and wires on the ISS, so this is more fantasy than I originally thought.",1522800000,,1037,4.666666666666667

In the movie there is a kid who wants to go to space but of course being a kid can't. There also is a robot/AI that befriends the kid and devices a way for the kid to get into space and once there the characters go thru drama trying to get back home.

They where not lighted properly giving a low contrast setting and you could see the special effect optics that where used that ties in the different items in space (which appears as a transparent cut out around each image) and lastly space itself was not black but sadly dark grey at best with bleeding on the left and right edges. There is also some graininess in some of the faster moving scenes of the movie.

If you have the DVD of this movie, do not waste your money on the Blu-ray version.

1973012,4,B00015HVM4,"**MOVIE**

As a movie, it's solid. the teen characters are fun and distinct without being cartoonish or flat. They each have their own thoughts and perspectives and, while none of them are given much chance to be particularly deep or nuanced, they come off as real people at all times. Perhaps more important than that, they're very likable characters who are extremely easy to root for. Leading the teen cast are Lea Thompson and Kelly Preston, both excellent, and a very young Joaquin Phoenix (back when he was still going by his birth name, Leaf); Larry B. Scott and Tate Donovan round out the main set of teens. Every one of them is fun to watch and really brings their character to life with a ton of charm. Seeing a great group of characters who are all intelligent and *proud of it* is such a rare thing in cinema, especially from the Eighties. The characters are never once in the movie mocked for their intelligence, played as nerds, misfits or losers. That alone gives me a tremendous love for the movie. The adult cast, led by Kate Capshaw and Tom Skerritt, is solid. Capshaw is very broad as Andie, often coming off too heavy, but Skerritt is, as always, perfect. His delivery of ""my God...we have liftoff"" is honestly one of my favorite line readings in all of cinema because he just *nails* every bit of the numerous divergent emotions his character feels in that moment and makes it all seem as effortless as breathing.

The movie moves at a solid pace, introducing its characters, letting them mingle briefly, throwing in some minor conflicts (later resolved, of course), then moving swiftly to the crisis that kicks off the major drama of the movie. The plot mechanics that make the crisis happen are absolutely contrived as heck and require significant suspension of disbelief (for the record, Thermal Curtain Failure, is an actual potential danger of solid rocket boosters exactly as described in the film), but if you can get past that part there's a great fun movie that happens afterwards. The weightless effects in the movie are solid and believable enough, and there was significant NASA participation in the making of the film, so the Production Design is top-notch. You believe 100% they are inside a space shuttle. The film is 100% CGI-free as far as I can tell (and in 1986, CGI was pretty obvious), so there are some optical artifacts like matte boxes, but you don't watch a Sci-Fi movie from the Eighties without an understanding that not all of the effects will work 100%. In this case, the ambitiousness of the film and many of the shots makes up for any unavoidable flaws in the visuals. The launch sequence is perfectly directed, seamlessly combining NASA footage with the actors, and is truly thrilling even after a hundred viewings.

**BLU-RAY**

I honestly never though this movie would get any sort of HD treatment - it never got more than a non-anamorphic letterboxed release on DVD. This was one of my favorite movies as a child, and deserved a lot more love than it ever got. It had the extraordinary misfortune of being made just before the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and being released just four months afterwards. A movie that features an accident involving a Shuttle could not possibly have done well so soon after America and the world saw one destroyed on live TV.

So just for it existing, I was willing to throw down a few dollars to get this disc. I am happy with it, but it's definitely not a reference-quality release and honestly could have been significantly better with a bit more effort. The video transfer is solid, but unexceptional, with a bit more digital noise reduction than I'd like (ideally: zero), but not so much that it's distracting. It's an Eighties film, so it has a soft quality to the picture no matter what. The sound mix is the really disappointing area of the film, being just 2.0. This is especially disappointing during the otherwise-perfect launch sequence. The extras are also practically non-existent: two interviews, one with Lea Thompson and one with the director, Harry Winer. I have not had a chance to watch those yet, so I can't speak to their length or when they're from. I really would have hoped for at least a commentary track and 5.1 surround.

4.5 stars for the movie - great delivery of a contrived set of events, with good writing otherwise, excellent characters, solid acting, good dialogue and fantastic production design.

3.5 stars for the actual release, which is workmanlike in the video and sub-standard elsewhere.",1506556800,4,4522,4.78974358974359
1973013,3,B00015HVM4,"Ok blu ray and great movie, 3 stars because this was not remastered or even taken from a new source, looks like the same source as the DVD was, lots of grain, should have truly cleaned up and not just up-converted to 1080p",1506556800,5,222,4.186046511627907

1973015,5,B00015HVM4,"VERY underrated movie (Just like Howard The Duck is)!! Just because a lot of people don't go to the theater to see something, that doesn't mean it's bad. Sometimes movies go up against bigger budgeted movies or more anticipated movies of which sucks patrons wallets dry .. in this case, the challenger explosion derailed this movie as being distasteful at the time (though it was made before the explosion but they had to delay the release date because of it), but us kids loved it off of HBO at the the time.",1503446400,,509,4.543478260869565
1973016,2,B00015HVM4,"The robot kills this thing for me.  I guess when I was younger I was a pretty sophisticated sci-fi fan, and when I saw the robot act like a cutesy robot all I could do was chagrin.  No, I didn't roll my eyes ... though maybe I should have.  Then when ""big moments"" comes, and the robot makes his emotional heartfelt statement, I think mentally I did a massive eye roll.

Okay, it's a kids' film.  I understand this, really I do, I do understand the the need to make the plot something kids can understand.  Now, having said all that, I think kids are a bit smarter than a lot of adults give them credit for, though not always sophistcated.

The truth is it's a child's fantasy, but even so the film bills itself as being sort of semi-plausible in a kids' science fiction sort of way.  That, and it is another product of Hollywood, the same people who bring you some pretty cool gems, but also give you some stinkers as well.  This film lies in a strange shade of grey.

Truth be told this thing needed a different script, and maybe set a few years in the future to round out the plausibility aspect.

Otherwise, as a kids' film, I guess it's okay, but only just.  Like I say, I was probably a bit too old to be watching this thing, but I think even my inner five year old was thumbing his nose at this thing.

If nothing else it'll kill a Sunday afternoon.

1973057,4,B00015HVM4,"I remember as a kid, desperately wanting to get on the game show ""Double Dare"" because one of the coveted grand prizes for completing the obstacle course from time to time was a trip to ""Space Camp""! Of course, I wanted to go on ""Double Dare"" anyway, whether the trip to SC was included or not, but that's beyond they point. The fact of the matter is that, logistically, Space Camp was not a financial possibility for many families who had kids with dreams of working at NASA or going into outer space someday, and winning a trip there was the only chance a kid from a lower middle class family like I was had to go.

I remember the first time I saw this movie. It was early 1987 and we had made our weekly trip to the video store to pick up some tapes to watch that week and I stumbled across this gem. It was just over a year since the Challenger Disaster had happened and there was a lot of speculation at the time that NASA wouldn't survive the fallout from the catastrophe, so I think the idea of a lighthearted family film about a Space Shuttle malfunction might not have been the best idea in hindsight, but regardless, I read the description on the back of the VHS and I was compelled to rent it. The movie was great. I watched it several more times that week before we had to return it. Although there were many inaccuracies in the film and a lot of stuff that would NEVER have happened at the real Space Camp, I was still very entertained and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

Many years would pass before I would see it again. In fact, I think about 25 to be exact. I just happened across the movie on HDNet Movies one night and decided to DVR it. I planned a movie night with the kids to watch it and, low and behold, not only did they love it (I wasn't surprised), but I still loved it (that was a surprise). It still ignited that childlike wonderment in me that I thought had disappeared long ago. It is still a ridiculous premise that a bunch of kids and one adult could accidentally be launched into space and still successfully navigate the orbiter back to earth (there are seasoned astronauts and pilots who had trouble doing it and they knew what they were doing). That being said, I believe that they captured the actual experience of attending Space Camp back in the mid-eighties perfectly (at least what I imagined it would be like) and thats all that really matters right? It's a fun family film that has a pretty solid cast with Kate Capshaw (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) and Tom Skerrit (Alien, Top Gun) rounding out the major adult cast and Lea Thompson (Back to the Future), Tate Donovan (Memphis Belle, Argo), Larry B. Scott (Revenge of the Nerds), Kelly Preston (Twins), and Joaquin Phoenix (Walk the Line, Gladiator) rounding out the youths in the film.

The plot is simple, a trained astronaut, who is is frustrated that she has not been assigned to a shuttle mission yet, and acting as an instructor at the Kennedy Space Center Space Camp in Cape Canaveral, takes a group of teenagers and a 12 year old onto the Space Shuttle Atlantis to let them experience a test of the SRB (solid rocket boosters). A camp robot, who has befriended the 12 year old and has overheard his desire to go into space, sneaks into the command center and triggers a malfunction that forces mission control to launch the shuttle to prevent the shuttle from blowing up on the launch pad and killing all on board. The shuttle, ill-equipped for space flight (it doesn't have enough oxygen or even a long range radio on board yet) is basically a floating tomb for the 6 would-be astronauts. The team needs to use their skills, think quickly under pressure, and utilize a still under construction space station if they have any hope of returning home.

Although the chain of events that leads to Mission Control being forced into launching the shuttle into space are about as far fetched and improbable as it gets, the idea behind using telemetry to contact NASA and having to use real orbiter re-entry procedures helps give the movie a bit of authenticity and also helps propel the exciting climax of the film.

I may never have gotten to go to Space Camp, but I kind of got to go in spirit thanks to this movie and that is good enough for me.",1454025600,,4253,4.440460947503201

1973102,5,B00015HVM4,"The movie didn't do a big box office draw for two major reasons 1. The release of the ""Karate Kid2"" & ""Top Gun"", 2. The release was too soon after the tragedy of the Space shuttle ""Challenger"" .Grant you the plot was not plausible however it brought together  several personalities to work and achieve as one when the chips were down. Most memorable was young Leah Phoenix's role as the child genius Max who bonded with the 'driod ""Jinx"". It is because of Jinx's desire to help Max he causes a catastrophe forcing NASA to launch  the rocket in order to prevent it from blowing up.. When the only experienced pilot played wonderfully by Cate Capshaw  (a far different role from her 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom role"", Andie (played by the great character actress Leah Thompson) decided she is the only one fit to take the command due to her knowledge of the program until her error almost cost the team their lives. Tate Donovan's character as the slacker who comes through at a critical time, Kelly Preston performance shows her gifts as an fine actress.

Some of the scenes are very improbable if anyone is familiar with shuttle flights, but the story is good and the scenes of space are awesome to view. This movie came out apparently before the Challenger disaster and before modifications were made to ascent suits but it is good entertainment, with some unfortunate bad language that I wouldn't want my children hearing, so I would only give it three stars. JINX is a robot that becomes friends with Max and so ""helps"" put Max in space without adequate preparation of the shuttle. He cares about Max and wants him to have what he thinks is Max's wish.

1973152,4,B00015HVM4,"My first impression on seeing this film the first time in 1986 was that it was going to be just another one of those teenager comedy movies and after watching the whole film from beginning to end I turned out to be wrong. The first half is some of the usual teenager antics that you would expect and by the middle it takes a very serious turn. For anyone interested in our space program which probably has more to it now than in  the mid 1980's, the second portion offers a very good idea of what it would be like to take off in a shuttle and what it would be like being in space with the dangers that could take place. The space scenes and photography are very,very good. When playing this film audio wise play it on 5.1 surround. It will almost make you feel you are on board.  You have some teenagers training at summer Space Camp, and when they get the chance to actually go on board a shuttle to experience what it would be like with the engines running, that was where it was supposed to be it. Due to an unforseeable circumstance which I'am not going to say so I don't spoil the film, the shuttle unexpectedly has to be launched or the 5 teenagers and female pilot trainer on board all will die.  Once in space, they discover that the shuttle was not flight ready and communications with NASA are cut off. Added complication their air supply is running out. I will say that this film ends great with unexpected turns .  When you see it, never say you could never do it.  This is a very good enjoyable movie worth watching again and again. Very clean and good for the whole family.  Very good cast :  Tom Skerritt from PICKET FENCES and many guest appearances in many favorite tv shows and movies, a fantastic actor. Kate Capshaw famous for her role in INDIANA  JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (she was blonde haired in that picture, and she is dark-haired in this one) another fine actress, also Terry O'Quinn, Lea Thompson, Kelly Preston and others. I know this picture is 27 years old now, but it's still very good.  Adults, teenagers, family members should enjoy it.  Runs 1 hour and 47 minutes",1359849600,3,2101,4.364102564102564

1973172,4,B00015HVM4,"I was really enthusiastic about space as a kid, and I rented this movie a dozen times or so on VHS.  It's a great kids adventure type movie.  I had always believed the movie had come out after Challenger to re-energize interest in the space program.  That aside, it's a great way to reminisce a bit about the space program as it was, as well as the youth astronauts program.

The film is standard 80's fare, gives you a mold of who the characters are and allows them to develop as the story moves along.  Some people criticize that style of film making, but there is something satisfying about it as the film reaches its resolution.  The (future) star power of the cast is big, as most went on to significant careers over the next decade or so.

The biggest weakness (which I never realized as a kid) was the ""12 hour"" issue.  As they achieve orbit, the characters discover they have 12 hours of oxygen left, then as they're reaching the space station, suddenly there's only an hour.  Some sort of discussion by the characters explaining that (i.e., ""It will take about 12 hours to reach the station"") would have made the story stronger.  True, the plot is not award-winning to begin with, but for what it is, that added element would have strengthened the story.  Then the kid characters have to come through, and they do.  Again, it's expected, but there's a satisfying element to it for an 80's film.

Overall, not award winning, but if you're a space enthusiast as I was as a kid (and still am), it's a great way to spend an hour and a half or so.

The only disappointment--I hoped on the DVD to find ""extra features,"" i.e. ""making of,"" or features about the Shuttle program, Challenger, or the issues of the film coming out in the wake of Challenger, but there was not.  The movie itself is a fun way for space enthusiasts to spend an hour and 40 minutes.",1331596800,,1860,4.445427728613569

1973178,4,B00015HVM4,"I can't find a more fitting time to review this movie then on the day of the ""final"" space shuttle launch.  I must say that I am rather dubious if this is really going to be the final launch, manly because in the realm of politics, economics and American government things are seldom absolute.

Switching gears, this movie, ""Space Camp"" has an interesting story about when it was released.  This film was released only five months after the Challenger tragedy. I remember that day so clearly, January 28, 1986, I was eight years old and living in New Jersey.  My mother had a bad cold and I made her a PB & J sandwich.  I also made my first batch of tuna fish salad, watching something on TV I just didn't understand.

I digress, when this movie was finally released, I don't think the public was ready to embrace the idea of a disaster and/or mishap adventures in outer space.  Now I just watched this movie for the first time last week.  I must say that it was an interesting watch, because I was laughing so hard I couldn't stand it.  I realize many people found charm and nostalgia in this film; I just found it totally harebrained, even by 1980s standards. First and foremost the fact that boys and girls in their late teens and early twenties being that stoked about space camp didn't seem very believable.

Lea Thompson plays a girl who is hell bent on going into outer space.  No dreams of college, GRE/SAT scores, dating a cute boy or finding a job.  She wants to go into outer space, yeah that is the norm.

Kelly Preston plays a Madonna/Debbie Gibson stunt double.  She really demonstrates some dualism, being both daft and brilliant.  For instance, she is an air head in social situations but can dissect aspects of space technology.

Tate Donovan plays a guy whose father bought him a jeep; he can keep it as long as he completes space camp. Huh?

 Larry B. Scott plays a guy who wants to have fast food joints in space.

Finally we have the character Max, played annoyingly by a young Joaquin Phoenix, is a twelve year old kid who is obsessed with Star Wars and is making references to it constantly. I love SW but became bored of all the alluding.  I began to wonder if George Lucas was paid permission for all the citations from the SW films.

 Kate Capshaw plays the teacher, who takes her job as a space camp instructor a bit too seriously.  Tom Skerritt, who has been in every movie, plays Capshaw's husband.

Let's provide some lucid reasons why I found this movie to be an unintentional comedy.

* In space camp it is wrong for an adolescent girl and boy to sneak off site to talk and neck.  Yet it is totally acceptable for Max to hide a 68 million dollar robot in his closet.

* This same robot, name Jinx talks to NASA to send these kids into space.

* This team of kids fail their flight simulation, resulting in death, but then is give the honor of sitting in a real space shuttle.

* Space Camp students are put in a real space shuttle that is ready for launch.

* When the shuttle takes off a random seagull flies across the screen.  Loved this part.

* NASA is able to keep this rogue shuttle launch secret from the President of the United States.

* The portrayal of how inept NASA is.

* Kelly Preston performing the Morris Code for eleven hours.

* Joaquin Phoenix floating in space.

* Kate Capshaw being accosted by an oxygen tank.

I could go on, but there is no point.  Overall I found this movie very enjoyable, not because it was a family film or a good film for that matter.  I found nostalgia in it, being that it was a film from the 1980s and it was so asinine it was a hoot.  My rating is strictly based off the B movie factor.  This movie is a total sign of the times, the Regan Era, the end of the cold war, the Space Program and sadly the Challenger.

This film, believe it or not has some historical reference of an era that is long gone.  Under the assumption you have a twisted sense of humor, like me you will love this movie.  If you are looking for a low violence film to show the kiddies, this might be your cup of tea.  The DVD is bare bone, no special features.  So saddle up, grab your space suit, because in space camp you are going up!!!",1310083200,3,4194,4.312419974391806

1973191,4,B00015HVM4,"""This one time at space camp...."" Ahahaha...ahem...oh well. Down to business. Participants in NASA's real life Space Camp can undergo a limited version of real astronaut training. Well for a few of them the training gets a little too real. Lea Thompson, Kelly Preston, and some teen age punks are accidently blasted into space, along with astronaut Kate Capshaw. You'd think being stuck in space with those three ladies would be a fantastic weekend, even with Joaquin Phoenix along as a whiny brat. Well it is, until the oxygen starts to run out. Whu-Oh! Luckily Tom Skerrit is on the ground to help out.

  This is a fun little movie meant simply as family entertainment. Of course it has technical inaccuracies, it's a movie about kids being launched into space. I just don't understand people who rag on it because some aspects aren't technically correct. This isn't a NASA training film, it's just an exciting little movie that a family can watch together. It also stars Larry B. Scott, who played Lamar in Revenge of the Nerds, and Terry O'Quinn, who played Locke in Lost.",1295568000,4,1077,4.8108108108108105

1973198,3,B00015HVM4,"I loved Space Camp the movie when it first came out.  It was mainly filmed in my home town of Huntsville, AL about the same time that I went to Space Camp. At the time, a lot of the stuff you see in the movie really happened at camp (leaving out the poet license and plot devices of course!).  What I didn't remember is ALL THE LANGUAGE that's in this movie!  My oldest son went to Space Camp for the 1st time this summer (which is even more incredible now than it was then & I worked there in college too).  I got the movie (faster than Amazon estimated) after he came back.  He invited his best friend to come over and together with the rest of my kids watched this movie.  My eyes were about to pop out of my head at all the foul language!  Still like the movie but as a parent, really hate the language and would never have bought it for him had a known!  I'd prefer to give it 2.5 stars but will round up for nostalgia's sake).",1252800000,,932,4.0271739130434785
1973199,4,B00015HVM4,"I've always had a soft spot for this 80's family movie.  It's perhaps even more enjoyable today, simply to see the younger Kelly Preston, Joaquin Phoenix and Lea Thompson playing hapless spacecamp kids trying to find their way home after a routine excursion accidentally catapults them into orbit!

In SPACECAMP, Kate Capshaw stars as Andie, still nursing a bruised ego in her failure to land a spot in the space programme, and less than thrilled about spending her summer ""babysitting"" at SpaceCamp.  When Andie and her motley gang of students (Tate Donovan, Kelly Preston, Joaquin 'Leaf' Phoenix, Lea Thompson and Larry B. Scott) are forced to actually launch the spaceship in which they are touring because of an overheat malfunction, they band together in their quest to return home.

 It's a really fun movie.  Wish there was some kind of reunion audio commentary included (like on ""The Goonies"" DVD), but I doubt this film has enjoyed the same kind of combined popular and cult following.",1249171200,4,994,4.993939393939394

1973213,2,B00015HVM4,"This was one of those movies I remember as a child, unfortunately I must remember the good adventure and not the filthy mouths of the actors.  I watched it again recently, and was in shock with the amount of profanity used in the movie.  This is a kids movie, right?  I just don't understand how using ""s***"", ""a**"", and ""d***"" adds anything to the movie.  There were at least 10-15 uses of these words during the movie, and I cringed to the point of turning it off.

I can't recommend this movie at all!  If you, like me, care what comes out of your child's mouth, stay far far away from this movie.  If you care about what comes out of your own mouth, then you don't need the reminders in this movie!",1234051200,6,702,4.2330827067669174

It, unfortunately, had the bad timing of being released shortly after the 1986 Challenger accident.  Had it been released earlier I think it would have found an audience and done pretty well.  I recently showed this movie to my nieces and nephews and they really enjoyed it, espcially Jinx, the ""handyman"" robot in the movie.  It's a good movie for everyone in the family.  It has Steven Spielberg's wife Kate Capshaw, Lea Thompson from Caroline in the City, Joaquin Phoenix (although he's listed as Leif Phoenix in the creidts) and Kelly Preston, John Travolta's wife.

This is an excellent family picture.  It shows how people can step up to meet challenges.  Of course, watch this movie with your children.  Then, you can use it as a tool to encourage them!

I all of a sudden remembered this movie and instantly had a strong desire to watch it again, with my daughter.

Yes, the plot is unbelievable, corny, campy, whatever.  But it is a fun movie that your kids (10 and under) will love.  It's one of those movies that's great to fall asleep to on a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1140048000,3,588,4.290909090909091

This movie is about a group of teens enrolled at Space Camp and found themselves in orbit. Throughout the film, they encountered a lot of life and death situations which miraculously brought back to Earth safe and sound with team effort with the entire team. Watching this film brings a lot of memories since I'm still a space enthusiast. The DVD makes the film looks even better since the quality of the picture and sound its better. To bad it needs extras like the making of the movie, a music video or a promotion about Space CAmp, but i'm still giving a five star. MAD PROPS!!!!",1112486400,2,742,4.423357664233577

When they get the chance to actually sit in a Shuttle whilst tests are made they think that is the ultimate adventure. Unfortunately a robot called JINX who has befriended Max (a very young Joaquin Phoenix), decided to help Max get into space for real and ensures the Shuttle is actually launched. This is where the group realise what adventure really is!

Formulaic movie with no real surprises but still quite a good film to watch, particularly for the youngsters. There are no extras (not even subtitles for the deaf) but it's a low enough price to forgive that.",1110499200,6,830,4.838028169014085

Certainly, there are tons of things wrong about the movie that would never happen at Space Camp or in real life, but that's hollywood and that's what makes it fun.  And when this was made, Space Camp itself was a pipe dream for many kids and the lucky few who got to attend as youngsters were treated like Gods, and are still revered today, so this movie was a way for us poor folks to go to camp without forking out the bucks.  Therefore to those of us who actually grew up in the 80's and remember seeing this move in the theater and the excitement of a space shuttle launch and still have dreams of being an astronaut, and for those of us who have worked at Space Camp its' definately a priceless jewel in the DVD treasure chest.",1080864000,14,1031,4.5675675675675675
