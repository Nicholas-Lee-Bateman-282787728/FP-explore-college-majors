2816398,4,B000PDZ9SU,"Having bought this hasn't changed my life but it has definately given me a different perspective to my daughter's different cries. For the most part I am able to tell what she wants but it is still sometimes difficult to distinguish between the cries -even after reviewing the DVD. It is a great DVD and aside from distinguishing what the cries mean, Dunstan does a wonderful job offering different techniques to help solve what is bothering your baby - from different burping methods to various feeding positions. This is very helpful and overall I do recommend the DVD!",1181433600,14,571,4.836734693877551
2816399,5,B000PDZ9SU,I bought this as a gift for my sister before her first baby but I have found it also helps me with my babysitting duties. I don't have kids of my own and was worried that my lack of experience might mean that I didn't feel confident enough to play a large part in this baby's life. Thanks to this I don't feel like I am getting it all wrong. I would recommend the system not only to new mothers but to extended family as well.,1181088000,22,426,3.9651162790697674
2816400,3,B000PDZ9SU,"I saw a TV broadcast and thought, ""Gotta have it."" My wife and I just had our first, so I thought it would be a good idea. It seems to be useful so far, and Dunstan is good at what she does. However,I was rather disappointed to find a combined content total (lessons 1&2) of barely 30 minutes (on two DVD's! wasteful), covering only five 'words'.

These 15 minute lessons are followed by extensive praise in the form of testimonials, so called 'Bonus Features'. These run longer than the lessons. I don't understand, if I'm at home watching the DVD I've already bought the item, so why sell it to me?

The content is quality - the item is 20% overpriced.",1181001600,21,654,4.396694214876033
2816401,5,B000PDZ9SU,"The Dunstan Baby Language is excellent. My wife and I thought we were coping (as this was our second child), but were finding being parents of a newborn again very stressful. We watched the DVD's and straight away started to hear the different cries of our baby. It is now week 8 and James is a settled and relaxed little bub because we know what he needs. The supporting info helps and there are some good settling techniques. Much less stress and we get a lot more sleep.",1178841600,54,473,4.386363636363637
2816421,5,B000PDZ9SU,"I saw the Instructor on Oprah a few years ago and ever since I've recommended it. Now, that i gave birth i had to get it for myself and I have to say it was sooooo.. helpful! I highly recommended for new mommies. It really helped me understand my baby's cries. It was so important for me to understand her cry and not be like, ""What's wrong with her?"" every time she cried..... I knew exactly what was wrong... whether it was a burp, her being wet, or hungry was a big one for me because I'm breastfeeding her.  The ""Neh"" sound was my cue...lol.. I actually looked forward to her cry and discovering her needs and It made me feel so confident as a mom that I was able to understand my little one.  Get it! by the time she 4 months old you'll be a pro at knowing and discovering her needs.  I don't care what anyone else has to say. It's a must. Get it. Lots of Love.

A few years later (dec 2016) I had our baby girl and used it the very first night she came home. This has made my first week as a first time mom unbelievably easier. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants to understand the sounds their baby makes. You can definitely tell the different sounds they make and figure out what they need. This has saved me so much this first week. I can't rave about this enough!!!,1483142400,4,514,4.15

2816442,5,B000PDZ9SU,"My husband and I just watched disk one, the lesson was between 15 and 30 minutes long honestly I wasn't keeping track. It seemed to give plenty of information without feeling overwhelming or rushed or too drawn out.

I too saw the overview of this on Oprah, however I disagree with some of the other people that the Oprah episode was enough for them to learn it all. I think the disk gives a wider variety of babies making the sounds so I can definitely recognize the sounds more readily after listening to the DVD lesson, as where after finishing the Oprah episode I knew the words but couldn't really recognize them being made by a baby.

With that said, I got my set of the DVDs  (two come in one case for those of you who are wondering) used from a library on here so it was only $4.99 plus shipping.

If I couldn't have found it used on here, I would've looked somewhere else to buy them just because $30+/- is kind of a lot even though I think this information is very valuable!",1459728000,4,984,4.274193548387097

2816487,3,B000PDZ9SU,This made us feel better about interpreting our baby's cries (we're new parents).  Sometimes it's still a little hard to determine what is wrong (unless he's hungry - that cry is usually pretty obvious).  it really doesn't take that long to go through all of the information - certainly not two discs worth.

We're now expecting our fourth and I'm tired of checking it out from the library, so I'm finally making the purchase. We credit this program and the Happiest Baby program with how ""easy going"" all of our babies have been.

As for those who say that ""my baby don't speak that language"", well...I used to work in a big box store after my first was born. I would hear babies almost daily making these exact same sounds. Whenever I heard the sounds I'd wander over and help the parents, tell them our story, and suggest the DVD. Maybe some people just don't have the ear for the sounds, but I hear them whenever I'm around newborns.

In my opinion, the information is worth every penny, especially to first time parents. That first three months is the hardest you'll ever work and you deserve the confidence this program will give you!",1417478400,2,983,4.425414364640884

2816493,5,B000PDZ9SU,"I'll admit I didn't order this specific product but I read the Dunstan book and saw the videos on youtube. I just cannot stress enough how awesome and helpful this is. I've been able to hear when my baby was hungry from day one, then on to gassy, colicky, uncomfortable etc. He's a very happy baby and comfortable in knowing that I understand him (at least that's what I think, maybe he's just naturally comfortable ;-)). He doesn't cry a lot, sometimes you'd forget that there's a baby in the house.
Dunstan baby language is my number 1 tip for any mom. You can also order tickets on her website that give you access to the videos for 1 day, 15 days or 3 months. I really needed only one day watching the youtube videos but they've since been taken down. Some people can't really hear the difference between the crying, my husband, for instance, wasn't very good at it at first but stick with it, keep your ears open and you'll figure it out.

(I first learned the Dunstan Baby language, then gently implemented Baby Wise and also learned about Wonder Weeks. This is the Perfect combination in my opinion)",1416441600,,1106,4.502487562189055

I have never taken information and applied it so quickly to a real-life situation.  Dunstan's theory proved true with these little ladies.  It was especially helpful to see and hear other babies making the same sounds on the DVD.  We all have our own voice -- and so does each baby, so these examples helped my niece discern the cries of all three of her beautiful daughters.  It made feeding time much less stressful, since we understood what they were trying to tell us.  I recommend this DVD to anyone caring for a baby!

Not only did it help me understand him and meet his needs quickly, I think it helped him trust me and get a jump on understanding communication. He said his first word when he was still an infant (""tickle"") and was reading a small amount by age 2. He is six now and ahead of his peers in language, reading, etc and we have a very tight bond. He knows that I will ""understand him"" when we talk. Now, when I see a Mom struggling to understand what her baby needs, I recommend this system to her.

2816544,4,B000PDZ9SU,"Our first baby cried constantly. I could tell it wasn't colic, but I just frantically did everything to cope. It was terribly distressing and I never had success--not even other experienced mothers could help me.

When I was expecting the second baby, I saw this at a thrift store and bought it. When I heard the Eairh sound that Mrs. Dunstan says you should avoid at all costs, both hubby and I were like ""that's exactly the cry she made ALL THE TIME.""

So when the second baby came, we caught the ""eh"" sound right away and sometimes it took forever to get rid of it. Whereas I would have given up and tried some other soothing technique with Baby #1, with Baby #2, I kept at trying to get rid of the ""eh"" sound until I did. Success. In his first 3 months, he only once said the ""Eairh"" sound that we basically forced on our daughter out of our inability to figure out why she was crying.

And my hubby felt so much more empowered. He'd recognize the cry and know if he was hungry and therefore handed him over to me, or if it was something else, he promptly helped. Unlike with baby #1 where he just handed her over because he couldn't settle her right away, he helped out a ton more.

For my boy, he said the ""heh"" sound for wet diapers. One time he said it but wasn't wet and stumped me for a bit, but then I remembered it could mean hot or cold. I took off his blanket and VIOLA, he was happy.

The package is overpriced if you think solely in ""there's 2 DVDs of less than an hour of information"" but TRULY, listening to the wide varieties of how different babies make the sounds is the real value of these DVDs. I can tell you ""neh"" but listening to 20 different babies say it is helpful, because your baby will not sound like another baby, so learning to decipher each of the DVDs babies noises helped us figure out ours. Ours combined Neh and Owh for sleepy because he wanted to nurse to sleep, and I wouldn't have picked that up without this DVD. It does take some time and lots of listening, but you are so much further ahead watching the DVD examples several times over.

Truly $30 might feel expensive, but the woman has to make money and how many people wouldn't bat an eyelash on that for a steak dinner? If it makes 3 months of a newborn's care easier to handle and him/her happier, than it's worth it's weight in gold.

The reason I'm reviewing now is because Baby #3 is on his way this week and I pulled it back out to watch again. So happy I have it to review.

Update: This is definitely newborn only, pick up before you have the baby and be prepared, my baby is 3 months now and it's been awhile since he's used these words to talk. But he did use them. After 17 hours of labor the doctor held him up and the first thing my son told me was he was tired. (Me too, buddy!) Promptly nursed him and he went to sleep. When the nurses took him to bathe and brought him back my visitor thought he was making the cutest noises (he was) but I listened closer and realized the underlying sound was uncomfortable and noticed the nurses had double swaddled him and my room was rather warm. Took off his second blanket and viola! He settled. So empowering to know what your baby is saying from the get-go.",1378512000,,3212,4.211382113821138

My first impression after watching the DVD is that it's quite overpriced for what you are getting.  It's 2 DVDs, but each only has about 15-20 minutes of content, most of which is watching examples of babies making the sounds.  I think this DVD should be at least half the price and consolidated onto 1 DVD.  The DVD also comes with a nice, big fold-out pamphlet with the reminders of the sounds and what they mean.  I think this will come in very handy instead of watching the DVD all over again.

However, whoever produced this DVD set is a bit too greedy for the money. They put the first 3 baby words on the first DVD and the remaining 2 baby words on the second DVD. Each DVD duration is very short. After Priscilla taught the baby words lesson, she explained very trivial ways to how to sooth the baby's particular needs: it is too trivial it is just common sense. For example, if your baby expresses this word, she wants to be burped and here are some ways to burp your baby. It is too trivial that it feels like that entire section of how to sooth your baby is a filler for the DVD duration.

I wouldn't mind if they put all 5 words onto the same DVD. But stretching out the already thin material onto 2 separate DVDs and then asking for $26 for the DVD set, it is too greedy.

I tried listening in for similar noises. The only one that matched the page was 'neh'.
I thought it was quite cool that baby has different sounds for their needs. We didn't follow the sounds religiously as we discovered that baby had his own tones that we started to understand. Now that hes over the 3 months Ive noticed some changes in his sounds & learning all over again what they mean.

The information itself is useful, but the value and clarity of her message gets lost in her delivery.  :(  The delivery contains no dialogue...just one person narrating and a lot of babies crying.

Let's face it - parenting infants is stressful.  A little humor could go a long way in the deliver of this information and there certainly is a great deal of humorous material to make fun of...only this dvd didn't make it so fun.

Patricia Dunstan is amazing.  Her work is featured on an episode of Oprah years ago. I must say Oprah did a far better job of encapsulating this information in a  25 minute segment, and made it far more palatable.

Sure, I would've figured it out eventually, but it was so nice to have a shred of a clue in those first days and weeks when my whole life was turned upside-down and all I wanted was to help my baby stop crying!

When I watched the video, my baby was 2 months old, and I felt like I already knew my baby's basic cries, just as I suspect any parent would. Furthermore, the video includes ""solutions"" to address the various cries, but the ""solutions"" are ridiculously obvious.

2816604,4,B000PDZ9SU,"As a neonatal and postpartum nurse, I can attest that these sounds are universal, and that because they are related to reflexes, they are consistent and correspond with what Ms. Dunstan claims in her program.  In fact, I think most people that work with infants can tell what each cry means, but perhaps those, like me, didn't know the particulars of HOW they knew.  Basically, we know from just being around a lot of babies. And, every baby sounds slightly different.  So, while I have to learn a lot of babies each day, the good news is you will only have to learn YOUR baby, and his/her particular nuanced sounds.  This makes the program that much easier.

Okay, bad parts right up front:
1. The program could have fit on 1 DVD and it is OBSCENELY priced.
2. There are far too many testimonials on the disks. (Yes, testimonials are great, but shouldn't be 1/2 of the content.)
3. Not all the sounds are easy to pick up.  I still have trouble distinguishing upper wind and lower wind sounds (however infant body language helps).
4. Why wait to hear the ""Neh"" cry to know your infant is hungry, when if you watch body language such as a more alert state, turning of the head, sticking tongue out repeatedly, a sucking sound, etc. you will already know?  Those are the signs that your baby is hungry, long before a cry every comes out.

Now, the good parts:
1. The program actually works.
2. Parents have more confidence in themselves and the first several weeks after learning how to discern cries (They become THEIR BABY's expert).
3. Infants that have their needs met, cry less and have a happier overall disposition.
4. Parents get A LITTLE MORE sleep.
5. Ms. Dunstan gives a variety of effective solutions to the common needs related to the 5 cries.

Taking a new baby home can be stressful for a new parent.  It's even stressful for ""repeat"" parents.  Many parents are amazed at how much they have forgotten from their first to second babies, even in just a couple of years.) While the only REAL drawback of this program is price, it is a valuable tool to know your baby's communication, and be able to respond with confidence and appropriate action.

Whether you buy this program or wing-it on your own without this program, in a few short weeks, YOU will be the expert on your infant.  Yes, docs, nurses, grandparents may be baby experts, but YOU will be the expert regarding YOUR baby.  Since this program allows parents to get a leg-up on the process of discerning what their infants needs (and gives easy solutions to those needs), I can't imagine why parents wouldn't want to know all they can, right away, for a great start in parenting. (I also recommend this for grandparents, babysitters/nannies, aunties and uncles, and anyone else that will be interacting regularly with your infant.)",1320364800,6,2802,4.645748987854251

My third child (4 months) has almost never had to cry for a need -I know exaclty what he's saying and give him what he's asking for: be it food, pats on the back, or just a nap.

Then my son was born and I was desperate for anything to understand the crying, what I could do to help him. My son made the exact noises on the video and we learned to better read him. I lent the dvds out to a few friends in the years since and each one thought I was crazy (more their husbands) but each and every one returned the dvds with a hugely positive review stating they can better understand their child. Here's my interpretation of it- in the days/weeks/months following giving birth, anything that makes you more confident as a parent and a new caretaker is worth it! I believe that these dvds made me a more confident parent and as a result, my child became more relaxed since I was. I felt like I had some control over the chaos of newborn life, thanks entirely to these dvds. Yes they are pricey, yes you will have the ppl who don't want to believe.

Our baby's hunger cry didn't sound anything like ""Neh"" in the video, but we already knew how to recognize that.  The part of the DVD that helped us was the ""Eh"" and ""Eaire"" cries for upper and lower gas, respectively.  We have a very ""windy"" (gassy) baby so that has helped us to know when to burp him.

The testimonials aren't necessary. I payed for the instructions, not what other people may think about the product...
The information is good but I wish there were WAY MORE examples of the different sounds.
Our grand-baby never fusses much thus so far nobody really used the Dunstan tape.
By the time you need it you forgot what it was all about. I posted the card on the wall but honestly, I can't hear the difference between the cries...
We must be ""hearing dyslexic"" in our family.

If you can borrow this tape, borrow it. I was thinking to lend it to my church sisters.
I am sure many other families benefit from this but so far it hasn't done much for us.
If things change I will update this review.

Update: baby is 11 months old now. Daughter never used the tape, listened to it but I guess her baby was a super good baby to begin with and really didn't benefit from the d.v.d",1281398400,,957,4.340782122905028

experience at having decoded sounds babies make,
from birth to three-months-of-age, she explains the
logic behind the distribution of sounds.  We learn
how to make sense of which sound caregivers need
to identify - to correctly interpret the right
message that babies produce instinctively.

2816622,4,B000PDZ9SU,"The video is to the point.  5 different baby ""words"", what they are, and once you figure out what it is your baby is saying, then they go through various techniques on solving the problem.  Most of the problem solving baby ""holds"" are obvious... if the baby is hungry then feed it, and they show about 3 ways to hold a baby for feeding.  If baby is ""uncomfortable"" then check it's diaper or seatbelt straps or change it's position, etc etc.

I didn't want to give this a full 5 stars for 2 reasons... the video I got has 2 DVDs, and really, there's so little information that I can't see why they didn't just make it on one DVD.  Second, it's really hard to tell what ""word"" my baby is crying out.  They all sound the same, especially ""eh"" and ""eairh"" which is ""I'm gassy or about to spit up"" and ""I'm about to poop and I don't like it"".  There's a 5 second moment before a cry gets going when it's easiest to tell what it is, but you have to be really alert all the time to catch it, which is tiring.  It's nice that the DVD has so many examples of each baby cry, but it seems like with a 2nd DVD, the should have just made an interactive game of ""name that cry"" to help train the ear.

We had really very limited crying in the first four or five months thanks to this DVD and being on a strict schedule. My babies didn't need to cry because we were either meeting their needs before they knew they had them with the schedule, or addressing it promptly when they began to fuss by deciphering their cries.

For learning the difference between when he's hungry and when he's sleepy, this DVD was worth it. I think there's no need for 2 DVDs, all the content could be easily fit on 1 DVD.

Knowing what my newborn's cries mean right off the bat not only meant my little guy has never had to cry for more than 2 minutes (except for a few gassy episodes where it took a while to burp him), but it has given me wonderful confidence as a new mom!

The first time I heard his ""hungry cry"" I was amazed it was so clear to me. If I didn't know what his hungry cry sounded like, both he and I would have had some very frustrating times, since some days he is simply extra hungry (growth spurt maybe) and the last thing I would have thought he needed was to eat again so soon. But his hungry cry let me know thats what he wanted!

Sure, there's a particular sound the baby makes due to tongue position, etc, but what about if she's got her back arched, or if he's got his hands in his face?

All you really need to know are the basics -- there are different cries, they mean this, and here are examples (actually the examples of real babies was the most helpful part).  Her tips for meeting the needs of each cry were, honestly, laughable to us.  (""This is how you can feed your baby"" -- duh!)

It was the single best gift we have ever received, and we have since bought it for every one of our pregnant friends.  The DVDs are brilliant.  And this language exists.  Don't let anyone tell you it doesn't.  It does.  My baby (and all of the other babies in my mommy group) says every one of the five words, and each word means exactly what Dunstan says it does.

  We couldn't figure out why our baby was spitting up so much.  She would cry, and I would feed her (because I just thought she was still hungry - after all, I'd already fed her, burped her, and changed her diaper - maybe she was hungry again).  After watching the video, I realized she was saying ""Eh"" (burp me).  I kept thinking, but I DO burp her.  So the next time she did it, I burped her until she stopped saying ""Eh"" (20 minutes until I got all the burps out) and she was able to calm down, and I was able to feed her again without her spitting up.  I still use this language EVERY day, and she's 8 months old.

  This language is the real deal.  I agree that the DVDs could be condensed to one, and it could be sold for cheaper, but I would literally pay a hundred dollars for a video that teaches me what my baby's cries mean if I knew it were going to work, wouldn't you?

  Don't let the people who couldn't hear the difference in the words dissuade you from buying this video.  Just because you can't hear something doesn't mean it's not being said.

2816655,1,B000PDZ9SU,"The information on these DVDs can be summarized in about five minutes.  All they teach are five ""words"" that Ms. Dunstan has figured out supposedly correspond to a baby's needs.  Actually, the 2 ""words"" on the second DVD are just variations of some of the other ""words"", apparently invented so that they have a reason to make a second DVD and charge more money.  Most of the DVD is self-congratulatory material and testimonials in favor of Ms. Dunstan.

  This woman is a total quack.  The ""words"" are simply sounds produced as a by-product of a baby's physical state when he or she is hungry or gaseous.  Simply observing your baby's physical cues is far more accurate.  Our baby only produces one of these ""words"".  Parents, babies are pretty simple creatures.  When your baby is crying, they are only a few things he or she wants- feed them, burp them, change their diapers, or rock them to sleep.  Your baby is bound to make many sounds when he or she wants any of these.  Some of them may sound something like the ""words"" presented in this video.  It's like looking at clouds or ink blots and seeing all kinds of things in them that aren't really there.  The Dunstan Baby Language is a total load of rubbish.",1229126400,9,1213,4.550925925925926

She still had her fussy moments, but not nearly as bad as those first couple months...and she's really a good, happy baby overall. We recognized her cries for about a week or two, then either it was hard to tell or maybe we just got lazy about it. Now, at 6 months, her signals are more whines than anything.

It really works and allows you to easily communicate with your newborn baby. You can hear the sound of their cry and know whether they are hungry (nah sound), need to be burped (eh sound), etc. It was and still is (they keep saying the same words after three months if you reinforce them) a life saver for us because we know exactly what our baby needs.

2816674,5,B000PDZ9SU,"We received this video as a baby-shower gift a few months ago. We were very skeptical thinking this was another ""new age"" crock-pot, this time from Australia. We watched it laughing about it, but told ourselves that once the baby comes we'll see if we can differentiate the sounds - just to be cheeky about it.

First night in the hospital, the ""Neh"" of a hungry baby was pretty clear and obvious. But then we noticed that indeed other sounds could be distinguished. Over the next few nights we listened for them and the baby sounds Dunstan talks about are on the money. As brand new parents of a baby girl, our first night at home was a bit unnerving. In the middle of the night our girl started wailing - and of course we had no idea why. We listened a bit more carefully and it sounded, based on the sample sounds we heard on this video, almost identical to what other babies screamed when they needed to be burped. So we tried to burp the baby - in less than 30 seconds she let out a belch and stopped crying.
Since that night - and it only has been a few nights - the sounds the baby is making are clearly distinguishable from one another and follow the pattern outlined in the Dunstan Baby Language video. Plus it's kind of fun to try to figure out what she wants - we've made it into a game of who guesses first.

So is this a review of the DVD or the idea behind it. Well, what's more important? Sure, the DVD is short - but it doesn't need to be any longer for you to get the idea of what it is presenting. The examples of cries in the DVD are very helpful. Sure the production is banal and the 'suggestions' on how to comfort the baby simplistic, but the idea behind the video is priceless.
We have been able to be much more responsive to our baby's needs and have benefited not only from much better sleep, but also a much happier baby girl.",1214524800,7,1852,4.199438202247191

Obviously they give you 2 DVDs just because they want to charge you more.  The DVDs do not teach me anything more than what I've learnt from the TV show.  And the most important of all, that 5 crying sounds just simply doesn't work on my baby!

Here are my advices:
1. If you have spare money and want to buy this DVD set to someone as a gift, go ahead, after all, it is something different from just clothes, you know.
2. However, if you plan to buy it for yourself, I'd say don't waste your money.
3. Try to spend more time with your baby the first few weeks, and observe more.  Also, try to have a routine on your baby as soon as possible (e.g. sleep, eat, play, sleep, eat, play...).

His wife said it was just the thing for new mums and although my brother was skeptical he soon was telling me how amazing it was to actually understand what Oscar was crying for and how to handle things. Now that my wife and I are expecting we've got our own copy. The amazing thing is how simple it is to learn. And while the 2 disc system might upset some, I think it makes sense as the lady says to learn the first few words and master them before trying to learn the others. I've seen it work for my brother and his wife and am so happy that I will be able to help my baby from day one and better meet their needs.",1188864000,7,760,3.9415584415584415
2816706,5,B000PDZ9SU,"My husband and I purchased the Dunstan Baby Language DVD after watching it on Oprah.  It helped us through her first 3 months of life and gave us a calm baby that slept through the night since day one.  We owe it all to this program and knowing what our daughter needed the minute she asked for it.
I do not think it was overpriced at all.  I just saw it as paying a little less than $20 a month for three months.  It really was a great deal for our sanity!",1188345600,11,457,3.9347826086956523
2816707,4,B000PDZ9SU,"We watched this video before and just after our little baby was born.  It really helped.  Some of the tips (she calls them ""solutions"") are pretty self-explanatory (eg if your baby says ""neh"", the word for hunger, feed him)  Baby is now 7 weeks old, and I just watched again last night and really recognized the different cries.  They were definitely familiar.  It was fun to watch with my mom and see her enjoy learning to listen to him.",1187827200,14,438,4.493670886075949

When my son came it was such a relief to know what he was crying about! My husband loved it too, and could even help to settle him. WOW! I couldn't recommend this more highly. Worth the money.",1187568000,9,354,4.144927536231884

2816710,5,B000PDZ9SU,"I was at my wits end with a colicky 3 week old!  The sleepless nights and all day crying were more than I could bare.  Once my husband and I discovered and began to use the Dunstan Baby Language we immediately began to recongize the ""words"" our daughter was using. Eventually we were able to soothe and respond to our daughters needs in a timely mannor the result was she was less fustrated and cried less.  By the time she was 2 months old I was able to tell what exactly her cries meant to the point that she rarely ever even cried.  Today my 11 month old is the happiest baby ever!!! We are now signing to her and have found a way to continue our communication with our baby.  In a word this product is a miracle!",1186617600,17,716,4.122302158273381
2816711,1,B000PDZ9SU,"Priscilla Dunstan is so self-congratulating that the DVDs devote more time on how she developed the program.  It would have been more useful had she used more footage of the workshop with new moms and their babies at the end of each of the six lessons.

After all the money spent on the DVD and time to review the lessons there are no guarantees your baby will utter any or all of the claimed six newborn words. Save your money for diapers.",1186444800,22,440,4.353658536585366
2816712,4,B000PDZ9SU,"I Bought the DVD a month after I had our beautiful baby girl Larissa.
I must say it was an act of desperation. She just cried and cried and cried.
I received the DVD on a Friday afternoon and by Monday the relief was
intense. I got it! A week later now and I hear her cry and instantly know
what she wants. I'm not saying she doesn't cry at all anymore, I can just
figure out why a lot quicker and calm her so much faster so that she doesn't become wrought with distress. There are so many world shattering smiles now.
The DVD was simple, laid out in plain language. I found it got better after a couple of watches to really get my ear in tune. I recommend it for EVERY new parent.",1186358400,21,681,4.014705882352941
2816713,5,B000PDZ9SU,"So I was a bit skeptical, and when i heard people saying there wasn't a lot of content I was even more skeptical.  But i thought for $40 it is worth the risk if it can help my wife and I have just one good night sleep.  Let me tell you - we've now had so many good days and nights I'd pay $4 million for the knowledge I learned.  This is our second baby and lets just say the first one was a very different experience.  We now know exactly what our baby needs and can respond fast - no guessing, no drama.  And as a Dad i just love being able to help my wife and our life and home is just a happy place.  The content is short but every second is gold.",1185926400,21,651,3.75
2816714,1,B000PDZ9SU,"We received this set as a gift, and am glad we did not pay for it ourselves.  I agree with another reviewer that the amount of original material was limited to 5-10 minutes per DVD, and was overstuffed with filler material that is either useless or available in far greater detail in scores of other books (for example, burping a baby).  The 3 words on the first DVD and 2 on the second could have been easily been covered in 10-15 minutes total.

I also did not feel it was useful to present the material with no reference to any variation.  I have not found that our child follows the Dunstan rules for speaking.  Claiming that there are no exceptions to the rules (i.e. all babies do this exactly as presented) is not only false, but not helpful for anyone who has a baby that is aparently not like any other baby on the planet.

In my opinion, any parent who actually pays attention to their own childs cries and behaviors during the cries can figure out what their baby wants as well as the Dunstan method.  If your child is realy difficult to decipher, I doubt Dunstan will be of much help.

Though I believe Ms. Dunstan is a talented individual that was able to categorize some babies cries, I would not recommend anyone purchase these DVDs if you really need help.  Your pediatrician can provide much more information that is actually specialized to your baby and situation.  If you are very curious about the techniques presented in the DVDs, I would recommend borrowing not buying.",1185926400,17,1491,4.550561797752809
2816715,1,B000PDZ9SU,"While a small percentage of the information contained in the DVDs is interesting and useful, I thought it was incredibly tacky the way these DVDs are marketed. First of all, each DVD is only 30 minutes long, and includes 15 minutes of testimonials on each DVD.  Within the remaining 15 minutes per DVD, you learn 3 words apiece, followed by basic baby care techniques that aren't particularly well presented.  There's absolutely NO reason for the package to come in 2 DVDs, except so they can charge more for it.  There's only about 15 minutes of original material here. I would borrow but NOT buy this particular item.",1185580800,142,619,4.766355140186916
2816716,2,B000PDZ9SU,"I am a first time mother and have little to no experience around any children or babies as the youngest in my family is 20something years old. I had purchased the DVD to help guide me as I felt like i was just flying by the seat of my pants and that any little advice would help.

What I found, however, is that by the time this product arrived at my house I had allready begun to understand my baby's own language. I was completely confident that I understood her needs and I didn't needs someone else telling me how to react to her different cries.

After watching the DVD and taking it as seriously as possible I started to second guess everything I thought I already knew. After a week of attempting to react on the sounds rather than on my instinct, I became frustrated and even more confused than before. My baby doesn't sound like the babies on the DVD and to this day i haven't heard her express two of the five sounds mentioned on the video. So needless to say I wenb back to the 'mom knows best' way of doing things and that has worked very well for both of us. She is now a happy healthy 3 month old baby who I completely understand no thanks to Dunstan Baby Language.

My advice is that if you're a new parent DON""T PANIC! Give it some time and you will understand you child better than anyone else and you will find you do not need a DVD to help you.",1185494400,13,1363,4.15530303030303

2816720,5,B000PDZ9SU,"I am an experienced Mom and offered to babysit my niece.  I thought I knew everything until 3 week old baby Stella would not settle.  After watching the Dunstan Baby Language system it taught me how to listen for different cries a baby makes. I watched with delight as the sample of cries together with the simple settling techniques were outlined.

I was suddenly able to understand that Stella needed to be burped.  Suddenly there was silence, a settled baby and a happy, confident aunt.

I would recommend any parent, grandparent, babysitter or anyone who may be looking after a baby, get this product NOW!!  It is incredible. I wish it was available when I had my children all those years ago.",1183939200,15,697,4.672131147540983

You can quite literally understand exactly what your newborn is asking you for - no more guessing games at 3am when he is hysterical, (and so are mum and dad). It teaches you how to listen for the sounds your bub will make when they are asking for their very basic needs (need to burp etc). Who knew?!

Otherwise I would probably be tearing my hair out trying to figure out that he needed to eat yet again after just finishing a meal.

I was able to steel away more moments for myself because he could understand the babys needs!!!
Now, here we are with surprise baby number four arriving any day and almost six years out of practice. I still remember the sounds but requested the DVD from the library again to refresh my memory.
