8392278,5,B0039UAA8A,"This anime may be older but, it still holds it's weight in adventure. I is really deserving to be right next to the titles like code geass.  The anime series has to do with dople gangers, which no one has been able to pull off an anime series like it. The series remains unique and a favorite for many people who are or are not fans of anime.  Give it a try the series are a good deal now.  Before you had to spend 30-35 dollars for the dvd now it is affordable.",1394409600,,462,3.946236559139785
8392279,4,B0039UAA8A,"This is another fine anime here. There are plenty of fights. There are comedy,drama in the series. Also there are some reuse of material like school,school kids,people with powers , contracts,death & so on.",1374969600,,206,5.088235294117647
8392280,4,B0039UAA8A,"One thing I like about Kurokami in general is, although some of the battles and plot twists can seem a little generic, they hit you. And hit you hard, anything is possible in this series and this is something that makes Kurokami worth watching for any anime lover out there.

Containing Episodes 7 - 12.
Contains English/Japanese Audio with English Subtitles.

Resolved to find out more about his mother Keita travels to Okinawa along with Kuro and his childhood friend to meet his Grandpa, with only a picture to go on Keita is looking for answers. But in Okinawa things are going on that no one could ever imagine.

Returning to Kurokami being hard hitting. Could you ever imagine your encountering your mother, who actually isn't your mother who wants to kill you? In Keitas case drain his terra? Could you imagine the effect it would have on you emotionally?

Kuro isn't the only one with hard hitting battles. Lots of emotion and hard hitting action as its terra guardian vs terra guardian. Some sad but tragic deaths, and more importantly more information as to what the bad guys are doing and what their goals actually are.

The final episode on this boxset in my eyes is the climax of the series and really sets everything into motion. It's the kind of episode you'l be sat glued to your TV watching from start to end as it shapes the future episodes to come.

I love Kurokami, even if these boxsets only contain 6 episodes. They're fun, enjoyable and different.
I would say this series appeals to any age. Old or young, there's something here for everyone.",1288396800,,1565,4.6521739130434785
