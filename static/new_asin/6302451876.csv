There is somewhere a filmed stage version of a New York City Opera production that is much much MUCH better. I was bored with the movie, and sometimes I wondered why I was even bothering to watch it. It is terrible.",1077408000,9,371,4.23943661971831
468031,5,6302451876,"No Sondheim fan should be without this video. I know the arrows have been sent Elizabeth Taylor's way for this performance (And Singing!) but she's good in this role. Her singing voice is not supposed to be great as the role was written for Glynis Johns [Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins] Maybe a little unbelievable but certainly not bad. All of the acting appears a little more ""stagey"" than most movies should be but you're seeing a lot of legendary performances. Diana Rigg is excellent as is Lesley-Anne Down [both at the top of the beauty curve in this film]... and to miss the greats like Hermione Gingold and several others from the original Broadway cast (including the original Sweeney Todd, Len Cariou) would be a sin! All of the music is written in variations of 3/4 time so if you love a waltz, you'll love this movie.
P.S. If the PBS version is ever released, get that too. It is the closest thing to the Broadway version so you can get an idea of what it's supposed to look like on stage. That particular version is a little heavier on singing ability than acting ability",1059091200,33,1079,4.510204081632653
468032,1,6302451876,"Based on Ingmar Bergman's great sex comedy, Smiles of a Summer Night, the stage version of A Little Night Music remains one of the greatest musicals ever written by the genius Stephen Sondheim.  The production broadcast live from Lincoln Center in the 80s starring Sally Ann Howes was lovely, if somewhat overwrought.  What everyone seems to forget about this, due largely to its beautifully lilting operetta score, is that the story is really about sex under the birch trees.
On film, the story is a complete disaster.  To begin with, the setting has been moved from Sweden, the land of the Midnight Sun, to Vienna to coincide with its operetta styling.
The whole theme, similar to Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, is negated.  The screenplay further cuts the role of the Grandmother, an aged coutesan wise in the ways of love, played so deliciously by Hermoine Gingold, to almost nothing, and takes away the card game which sets up so much of the background material.
A lot of talent is wasted in this film, and as lovely as Elizabeth Taylor is as Desiree Armfeldt, she should have been dubbed, because she positively ruins ""Send in the Clowns."" (Listen to Barbara Cook sing it on her Carnegie Hall album).  Because Harold Prince is so dreadful a filmmaker (in spite of his theatre and opera success) he destroys the final scene, in which the summer night smiles three times, the third time on Gingold as the old who knows too much.  A long shot takes away the visual sequence in which we learn that she's died.
What a pity that such a beautiful show should make so dreadful a movie musical.  Do yourself a favor: get the delightful Ingmar Bergman comedy instead!",1016928000,43,1671,4.7612456747404845

Had the film been a commercial success she might have received an Oscar  nomination.  Several songs are cut including the chorus' comments  throughout but I still find it fun.""A Weekend in the Country"" is  perfectly done and one wishes Hal Prince had directed the whole movie that  well.

468151,1,6302451876,"This movie is so awful, it's torture to watch.  I can see how it would have been charming on Broadway, but everything went wrong when they brought it to the big screen, starting with the cast:  Elizabeth Taylor stars as an aging actress in turn-of-the-century Austria.  She invites one of her paramours (and his family) for an elegant weekend in the country, and her other lover (and his wife) come, too.

Liz looks silly in too much black eye make-up and her little-girl voice butchers the only memorable song, ""Send In the Clowns.  Len Cariou has a very good voice, but his face is blank and dull and there's no chemistry with Taylor.  Diana Rigg is elegant as always and blows everyone else out of the water.

It's supposed to be a too-too funny sex and morality play with music but none of the characters are likable or sympathetic; I didn't care who ended up with whom, I just wanted it to end. The songs seemed out of place with the silly plot, and the opening and closing device of staging it as a play made me dislike it immediately.",1377820800,4,1041,4.447368421052632

How do you take a very talented, all-star cast that includes Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Rigg, Len Cariou, Lesley-Anne Down and others, add a musical score by Stephen Sondheim, including Send In The Clowns, and still wind up with, in my opinion, a horrendous, fuzzy-video, atrocious audio VHS tape.

The sense of period and locale has been admirably reconstructed by the art director, using European settings to fine effect.  Overall, the cast is very good, with Len Cariou and Hermione Gingold stand outs  in recreating their stage performances.  However, Elizabeth Taylor's 'Deiree Armfeldt'  is siappointing,  Her singing is less than adequate, even though the composer has stated that ""Send In The Clowns"", surely one of Sondheim's finest songs, requires a singing actress, rather than a fully fledged singer.

468154,3,6302451876,"The locale was changed form Sweden to Vienna probably because the movie was financed by Austrian interests.

468155,1,6302451876,"First of all, I love musicals and the music that come from them as well. I was interested in seeing this one because of the song 'Send in the Clowns' and found it confusing as to why the only screen version I could find was this dated VHS. Seeing the Elizabeth Taylor was in it, it thought that it was going to be pretty good and while I waited to receive it I could not imagine why it had not been put into a DVD format.
First of all Ms. Taylor was the only highlight of the film, I have nothing bad to say of her performance. The storyline itself would ,in fact, be alright for a musical so that was not the problem. It was the music that fails this musical.  The music droned on and on, it was lifeless, a truly a pathetic attempt by whoever it was that did this musical score.  Send in the Clowns and one other song that was sung of Ms. Taylor's charactor by the two gentlemen in the Billards room were the only two listenable songs.  I was watching this with two other individuals, one male and one female that both ended up leaving the room and going to watch something else in another part of the house.
I understand now why this has never been put into any other format. Unless someone totally redid the musical score (accepting for the two previously mentioned songs) this thing should continue to be buried by the march of time.",1364169600,3,1338,4.23921568627451

468189,4,6302451876,"As a pastiche of time and place, it has no equal. Although the locale has changed from Sweden to Austria, there's no loss and, in fact, some gain. The era and place suits itself nicely for a tale of infidelity combined with lush settings and characters. Yes, the plot has changed substantially and, yes, Elizabeth Taylor is not especialy proficient as a singer but we must be grateful that this exists at all; Other than in snippets, no Sondheim work has every been transferred to the screen with most, if not all, of the score in tact.

On the plus side there are great performances, especially by Dame Diana Rigg, Len Cariou and Hermione Gingold. Even young Chloe Franks makes an amusing daughter to Miss Taylor's Desiree. And, as it's been restructured, the burden of the plot does not fall heavily on Miss Taylor. She gives a capable performance if not brilliant but then her character does not call for brilliance but really an understanding of the role, given that, she performs very well. But it is Diana Rigg who's command of the screen holds your attention. Unfortunately, Dame Diana has been too little noticed over the years but when she has appeared, she commands the screen. (Only Maggie Smith in ""Evil Under The Sun"" could hold her own against her.)

Len Cariou and Laurence Guittard repeat performances they the gave in the Broadway Stage version and it's easy to understand why they were not replaced with more bankable if less skilled perfomers. Hermione Gingold who would eventually play Madam Armfeldt on the stage gives the perfect reading of a modest if integral role.

But the triumphant ""performance"" isn't given by any actor but rather by designer Florence Klotz who's costumes capture the grandeur and exxagerations of the time to perfections. The opening and the closing with all the performers in white could have looked washed out, bland but in her stylings are important and meaningful.

While not for the taste of everyone, this is a ""must own"" for anyone who enjoys the musical theatre as, time has shown, very few of that genre are now given further life on the screen.",1343260800,2,2101,4.795580110497237

For me, the film works even with its faults. Yeah, the quality of the disc is mediocre, and much of the complex music of the stage version is omitted, BUT this is an interesting watch. If you're into theatre, this is a fantastic learning tool. By now, everyone's heard the ""Elizabeth can't sing a note if it were duct-taped to her"" story, but I loved what she did with the role of Desiree! The casting was brilliant, with several leads from the Broadway cast reprising their roles.

468191,1,6302451876,"1. Travesty. One cannot belabor enough the destruction of Sondheim's musical, perhaps the second best in American musical theatre. In a long series of marvelous musicals shattered by film versions--Fanny, Camelot, Man of La Mancha, et al--the combination of Hollywood arrogance and Broadway ignorance has left America with no idea of the value of what they've lost. This is OUR art form. After a history of great musicals, ending in Rodgers and Hammerstein's excellent films--Oklahoma, Carousel, The King and I, The Sound of Music (South Pacific was also annihilated by Broadway folks going west), 'genius' took over. Every musical had to be made new. And they were destroyed.

(The old fashion of making Broadway musicals new for film by substituting one new song for a Broadway number, almost always dull as saltines, was bad enough.)

It is Sondheim's music and lyrics that carry this play to perfection. Someone decided to make it a drama. The score was savaged. Some numbers were all right, but balanced atrociously by cutting other excellent songs, and then sending in the clowns in still others. The play cannot carry the music. There is not enough of it, and it is not Bergman's filmmaking. Again, some of the filming was aesthetically lovely, and some of it 1950 technicolor death. The performances were all similarly half and half--half fine acting followed by walking through the paces. The most you got were good one-liners. Changes to the lyrics sometimes showed Sondheim's cleverness, sometimes total lack of consistency and wit.

Elizabeth Taylor was perhaps right for the roll (pun intended), had she acted well for two hours, and stayed the same weight (and let's leave the voice alone for now). Len Cariou was one minute Egermann, one minute one minute Pa Kettle. Guittard's acting was at least consistent. (But both Cariou's and Guittard's voices had none of the power of the Broadway production). Diana Rigg was overdone, underdone, as though directed by someone, Hal Prince, who like Hamlet could not make up his mind as to what he was doing. Hermione Gingold seemed almost angry at what she must have known was happening to Madam Armfeldt. Erik, nee Henrik (what was that about?), was just silly.

Songs. It was a sacrilege to leave out Hermione Gingold's 'Liaisons.' -And the choral songs--'Remember?' and the sun numbers! -And Petya's great thigh-rubbing under the table' song, The Miller's Son!' Elizabeth Taylor sounded like Lina Lamont. Actually, David Horiuchi's last clause sums it perfectly ""all in all, A Little Night Music is one of the most dismal Broadway-to-movie adaptations ever made.""

2. Klutzy comedy. If you had no idea of the masterpiece herein destroyed, you might have enjoyed the show. -Some nice musical numbers, a little irreverent social comedy, some great lines.",1320624000,4,2811,5.1154684095860565

However, when played through two systems that do not have surround sound systems, the terrible bass sound is not present.  Both these systems use Dolby decoders as well, but have not separate bass spreaker, so that the bass is not enhanced.

The DVD transfer is acceptable quality but obviously not from a mint print - the ratio is also incorrect, with information missing from either sides of the frame.

468266,2,6302451876,"Witty, moody, poignant, and ironic, SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT launched Ingmar Berman to international fame in 1957--and has inspired others for half a century.  In the 1970s it inspired composer Stephen Sondheim, who with writer Hugh Wheeler adapted its complex tale of several misguided lovers to the musical stage.  Opening on Broadway in 1973, A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC was a great critical success, and although it did not have a spectacularly long run it has proven remarkably durable, enjoying many notable revivals in The United States, England, and Europe.

The 1978 film is quite a different matter.  Directed by Hal Prince, who directed the original stage version, and starring several of the original stage performers, it was a critical and popular disaster of legendary proportions.  This was partly due to the backers, who insisted on certain changes and cuts, and partly due to the cast, which was not always ideal; in an overall sense, however, it was due to Prince's utter inability to translate the humor of the piece to film, and what was quick and sharp and clever on stage became plodding and uninspired on the screen.

This aside, the great disaster of the film is Elizabeth Taylor in the central role of Desiree, an aging actress who determines to shed an unwanted and passing lover in favor of an old flame.  Some sources state that Taylor sang her vocals; other sources state that she was dubbed.  It doesn't really matter because whoever sang did so very, very badly; indeed, ""Send In The Clowns"" is so badly done that it is downright embarassing.  And perversely for one so well known for her beauty, Taylor actually looks bad in the film.  It would seem that cinematographer Arthur Ibbetson went out of his way to light and photograph her in the most unflattering ways possible, and her face often has a strangely mannish quality in close-up.

This might be forgiven if Taylor actually gave a good performance, but she doesn't.  She phones it in as slightly over-ripe melodrama and without the sense of cleverness or style that the piece requires, and since the role is central to everything it essentially contaminates the entire tone of the film.  There are indeed a few delightful performances here, with Diana Rigg a knock-out as the embittered Charlotte, but Taylor is so dire that it is hard to look beyond her to see them--and when combined with the overall plodding quality of the film it all adds up to a fairly poisonous package.

The DVD itself is a mediocre transfer of bad elements; I would not say that it is unwatchable, but it certainly isn't anything to write home about.  There are no bonuses of any kind to leven the film itself.  If you are a diehard Sondheim fan curious to see how this stage masterpeice was translated (no matter how poorly) to the screen, or if you think you can get past the directorial awkwardness and Taylor's dire performance to enjoy the work of Riggs, Guittar, and Cariou--give it a shot and good luck to you.  But don't say I didn't warn you.

She's perfectly cast and does a nice job singing ""Send in the Clowns"" which is undoubtedly Sondheim's best known song. Why did Hal Prince feel that he had to play an intense key light on her face every time she had a close-up. We all know how old she is and how old she was when she made this movie. She was still beautiful here. Of all the music that was dropped, I miss Hermione Gingold's LIAISONS most of all. The sets, costumes and locations are breathtakingly beautiful but Hal Prince's direction is clumsy.  What a shame the transfer is so poor. I too would prefer to have the PBS version with Sally Ann Howes but the version we have here would still be a must have collector's item for all the Sondheim fans. However, this is for die-hard Sondheim Fans only. Caveat Emptor! Three Stars for Liz, Diana and the source material.

468290,2,6302451876,"I've been curious to see this film for a long time, being a devotee of Mr. Sondheim's, as well as a huge fan of the stage show, so when this DVD was finally released, I jumped at the opportunity to purchase it. When it came to me in the mail, I popped it straight into my player and prepared myself to be at least amused, I hoped. Unfortunately, it was not to be. First of all, this film is just as bad as you've heard. And not even in any sort of ""so bad it's good"" way. It's just bad. It's tedious, and plodding, and filled to the brim with boring, dull performances. The one saving grace of the film is the glorious reworking of ""The Glamorous Life"", which, however, gains nothing from being seen on screen, and could just as easily be enjoyed on the soundtrack recording. On the whole, I'd recommend seeing Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night"", which, among other things, is set in the correct country, has sterling performances, and features some of the greatest dialogue recorded on film, between Fritz and Petra, characters who here (and in the stage version) have been reduced basically to extras. Secondly, the DVD itself is horrendous. The transfer is incredibly ugly- it looks like it was taped off of television in the late eighties. Not to mention, my personal copy started to skip uncontrollably during the song ""You Must Meet My Wife"", and continued to do so until the middle of the next scene. When I took it out to discover what was wrong with it, I discovered a large splotch of something on the playing side that ominously resembled dried blood, but which I'm going to assume was paint. And this is right out of the shrink wrapped package! Of course, I returned it, and I will say this: it was the very first time I've had to return something purchased on Amazon, and it was handled beautifully, so that system is running just fine.
Anyway, I gave the product two stars because I finally had the opportunity to see a film which I've been wanting to see since I first discovered Sondheim in my early teens. That said, I'm glad I had an excuse to return it.",1189036800,5,2074,4.4605263157894735

despite this, the sound quality is excellent. especially during Everyday A Little Death. This film, while heavily criticized in 1978 on its release, is a charming film. The songs are enjoyable and the actors do their best. Worthy of the Oscars it recieved, Diana Rigg somehow missed out. But the duelling between her and Elizabeth Taylor are worth it.

This musical takes an intelligent and humorous look at love. The wit and musical genius of Stephen Sondheim. Those who criticize Liz Taylor being to fat for the role, this is a period piece and for the year that the piece takes place in, Liz would not have been considered fat at all. She would have been thought of as a type of Mae West.  It wasn't a time of thin boyish types that didn't happen till the 20's.

468296,3,6302451876,"Well, there isn't a lot to say about this film that isn't covered elsewhere. So I'll ask if someone will issue instead the PBS film of the City Opera production with Sally Ann Howes, which is superior even if it's a taped stage production (the production values and talent were high). George Lee Andrews (who understudied Cariou and did the national tour) had grown old enough and into the part by then and Howes was very good. Too bad there isn't film of the best Desirees from many productions, Sian Phillips, Judi Dench and Glynis Johns (who someone mistook Howes for in another review). There is a clip of Johns and Cariou doing a scene for a Broadway benefit on an issued video and it's stunning. Taylor isn't all bad but Rigg would have been better in the lead, she's somewhat wasted. Taylor looks bored in some sections and over-directed in others.

Prince's other film, the unissued on DVD ""Something for Everyone"", is in a similar state or worse apparently, but within the vessel are a great comic performance by Angela Lansbury, supported by Michael York and a wonderful cast and a very dark comic story, as if Charles Addams and Brecht collaborated on an operetta and cut the music. If Hen's Tooth is the only label that will put that out as well, so be it.

Like so many other Sondheim fans, I'd been looking forward to this release because the 1978 film is--for better or worse--a rare record of one of my favorite Broadway shows. But, the film itself aside, this DVD is a problem. It is not professionally done. It's supposed to be a new, widescreen print in Dolby stereo, but it isn't. It's a terrible, scratchy old print, and the ""widescreen"" is apparently stretched out from a fullscreen TV print. The framing is so bad that the opening titles are all cut off, like on an old TV print. And the soundtrack is mono--not even very clear mono. There are more glitches and scratches and sudden jumps (indicating reel changes on old movie theater equipment) than you can count.

I swear, this looks and sounds like it was taken from a TV broadcast with second-rate equipment. Try pausing the picture, and you'll see the horizontal lines that indicate a broadcast on an obsolete TV. And there's a vertical slash down the entire center of the picture for much of the running time, projector damage from long ago. They didn't use the laser disc or VHF recordings, both of which are in much better shape, to make this DVD. Is this legal? Who is ""Hen's Tooth Video,"" anyway?

I don't know what we can do about this, but you really want to think twice before ordering this title. I'm furious, and you will be, too. What a rip-off!",1181174400,119,1401,4.6
468362,4,6302451876,"Like Sweet Charity almost a decade before, A Little Night Music was a musical adaptation of a foriegn language film, Ingmar Bergmans' classic Smiles of a Summer Night.

The Broadway musical was set in Stockholm but for the film they moved the action to Vienna and the beautiful Vienna Woods.  But the story remains the same.

Lawyer Frederick Eggerman had a torrid affair with actress Desiree Armfeld but is now married to the virtuous Anne.  Anne's best friend is the world wise Charlotte.  Charlotte's husband, Count Carl Magnus is Desiree's current lover.

When Desiree returns to town, a series of events are set in motion and no one's life will be the same.

Elizabeth Taylor takes over the role of Desiree (originated by Glyniss Johns). While she tries her hardest, this is a complex score and even the simplist of songs needs a trained voice.  Liz gives the best performance performance but her singing lets her down.

On the other hand, Diana Rigg takes over the role of Charlotte with flair.  Her Charolette becomes the center of the film.

Three original cast members reprise their roles.  Len Cariou, as Frederick, has the least demanding acting role but the most complex singing role.  And Cariou has the voice to carry it off (well he was the original Sweeney Todd).  Laurence Guittiard, as Carl-Magnus, has the comedy relief role and also the most complex song, In Praise of Women.  And finally the incomperable Hermionie Gingold as Madame Armfeldt, Desiree's courtesean mother.  She has not lost any of here grace or beauty.  This role is almost a reprise of her role in Gigi but 20 years later!

Also back is the creative team, director Harold Prince and writer Hugh Wheeler.  This is probably the biggest misstep of the movie.  Prince is a great theatrical director but does not have a lot of movie experience and does not take full advantage of the medium.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design (Florence Klotz who also won the Tony for the same.)

468367,5,6302451876,"Don't be fooled by all the outcry on the quality of this wonderful DVD. Anyone who has seen A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC in its previous video releases knows that this DVD release is magnificent in almost EVERY way.

The original Embassy VHS release was fuzzy and washed out - but at least there was some hint of color. The later Nelson VHS and Laser Disc release was fuzzy, washed out and drained the color out of the film completely. In both cases it was in full screen, the picture was compressed so that the actors faces were thin and angular and the sound was merely adequate.
Now Henstooth presents this long-lost film in the best version we have ever seen  since its original theatrical release. The colors are bright and warm. The picture is restored to its original size and the sound is crisp and clear. (All of this is rather remarkable considering that the word is that the original negatives for this film have all but been destoyed and is in need of a major restoration.) I didn't have much hope for this release when announced but having seen it, it took my breath away.

Now the film --

Based on Ingmar Bergman's film SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT, this musical film adapted by its Broadway creators Hugh Wheeler (screenplay), Stephen Sondheim (Music and Lyrics) and Harold Prince (director), concerns three mismatched couples.

Actress Desiree Armfeldt (Elizabeth Taylor), is seeing Count Mittelheim (Laurence Guittard) who is married to Charlotte Mittelheim (a delicious scene stealing performance from Diana Rigg). Frederick Egerman (Len Cariou), Deseiree's past lover, is married to the still-virginal Anne (Lesley-Anne Down), who is half his age. Frederick's son Erick (Christopher Guard) is hopelessly in love with his stepmother Anne (who is actually only a year younger than he.)

Petra (Lesley Dunlop); Frederick and Anne's maid, Madame Armfeldt (Hermione Gingold); Desiree's mother, and Frederika (Chloe Franks); Desiree's daughter - round out the action which occurs in town and culminates during a hectic ""Weekend in the Country"" at Madame Armfeldt's sprawling manor.

Forget what you've heard or read about the film. Yes, it is flawed in context to the Broadway original, but considering it was made when film musicals were all but dead in Hollywood, it is amazing that it even exists. The score is still just as witty and romantic and features a wonderful new version of THE GLAMOROUS LIFE written specifically for the film. The cast, many of them reprising their original stage roles, is uniformly superb! And despite all the nasty comments, Elizabeth Taylor is quite charming as Desiree (especially in the duet YOU MUST MEET MY WIFE with Cariou.) Sondheim even added a new verse or two for the marvelous song EVERY DAY A LITTLE DEATH.

If you get a chance - see this film in its new DVD transfer (The best it has ever looked or sounded on home video!) It just may steal your heart.",1133913600,4,2901,4.882113821138211
