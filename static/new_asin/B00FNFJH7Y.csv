6015424,3,B00FNFJH7Y,"There are a number of sports heroes today that are unlike any others from the past. These are heroes that aren't involved in the every day sports that most of us grew up with or participated in. These are the heroes involved in the X games and sports of that nature. While the line up of newcomers is vast, there are a few names that resound time and again. Such was the case with Shane McConkey.

With a father who was a ski pro and a mother who was tolerant of his desire to do different things, Shane was set to become the next up and coming ski pro on the Olympic team. But things took a turn in his life and he ended up uninterested in participating in that arena. A lack of interest in scholastics led to his leaving college and pursuing the dream of finding that next big rush. While this did little to inflate his bank account, it did lead to his becoming a celebrity of sorts which he later parlayed into a lucrative career.

Shane's beginnings of notoriety started with his skiing abilities and his choice to ski difficult or near impossible runs that no one else dared to. Skiing off of cliff faces down into slender runs that offered little space to ski was his claim to fame. The other was his willingness to make it all seem silly by doing things like skiing naked down a slope.

But that wasn't enough for Shane McConkey. The thrill, the rush, wasn't quite big enough. That's when he discovered bungee jumping which led into base jumping. For those who don't know what that is, base jumping is repelling off of a tall location like a bridge, electric tower or building and then releasing a parachute at the last minute possible. Yes, it is illegal and not recommended, but there are those who love it. Shane was one of those people.

When that too became too mundane he combined the things that interested him the most into a new sport. Climbing a mountain to get to the highest peak, Shane would ski down the slopes (what little there was of them) towards a cliff and then fly out over the edge. Releasing his skis, he would soar, flying if you will, until he hit that point where he would pull the cord and parachute the rest of the way.

This item alone would make an interesting film. But we also get the story of the man behind the thrills. We see Shane meet and marry the love of his life. We see the child that he adored. We get to hear from friends and family what a wonderful person he is. But the fact that we also don't get to see much in the way of interviews with Shane himself should let you know up front what to expect at the end. For those who are aware of Shane already it won't come as a surprise. It won't if you're an astute viewer of documentaries lacking the star either.

Through it all there is some magnificent footage of skiing, base jumping and parachuting in various forms that will captivate you and make you long to be able to do the same. For those of us unwilling to take the leap and put ourselves in mortal jeopardy it gives us the chance to see what it would be like via standard footage and helmet cams that capture everything from the world of flight to the crash landings that do bodily harm.

Some will see this as a confirmation of life, of the story of a young man with a dream who pursued it in every aspect of his life. Some will see it as the sad tale of a man who was willing to lose his life in search of a thrill. Depending on how you view the choices made on a personal level will determine what you think of Shane McConkey. In the end one is left feeling that he did indeed get the most out of his life, he did pursue his dreams no matter where they led him. At the same time we also regret that he didn't stay with us longer. If nothing else the movie will give you the chance to learn of and live the life of Shane McConkey if only for the running time of the movie.",1393372800,,3833,4.199728260869565

6015429,5,B00FNFJH7Y,"Excellent DVD! Shane Mcconkey lived a funfilled and exciting life and this film captures it in breathtaking images. Much more than a ski film, it is a celebration and remembrance of an individual like we won't see again. Incredible athlete, wonderful film.",1389484800,,256,5.119047619047619
6015430,5,B00FNFJH7Y,"Shane McConkey was a primal force in Big Mountain and Extreme skiing.  Behind his daredevil achievements and major innovations lay the soul of a highly intelligent, thoughtful, and generous person.  He is and will be missed.

6015431,5,B00FNFJH7Y,Awesome tribute to a great skier. Really worth the money- and awesome cinematography. I would recommend to anyone that like McConkey.,1389139200,,133,5.380952380952381
8617140,3,B00FNFJH7Y,"Would have fully enjoyed this story especially knowing the profits go to a trust in McConkey's name and  would
have given five stars to it no problem.................EXCEPT !!!
IT IS SUBTITLED IN EVERY LANGUAGE EXCEPT ENGLISH !! Don't know what distributor was thinking...every other
language EXCEPT THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. If one is hearing impaired as I am it really means
a lot to be able to watcha program such as this and understand all of the dialogue.
With this as the only glitch it is a  great story, wonderfully photographed and presented to the viewer. I would
highly recommend it to any person with normal hearing.",1487548800,,634,4.861111111111111

8617142,5,B00FNFJH7Y,McConkey Ski DVD is gnarly!,1448755200,,27,4.6
8617143,4,B00FNFJH7Y,From a movie perspective its a great movie if you love skiing. Shane was an amazing skier that did bring lots of energy and innovation to the sport. My feeling after watching the movie was that even with all his accomplishments. He was taking a lot of unnecessary risks for a guy that had become a father. I don't think he was being reckless per se. But he should have known when to say when. kind of seemed to me that he was afraid of growing up and being a real adult. All for his thinking outside the box... but being that afraid of an office job is a silly reason to keep jumping off mountains when you are a father.,1434326400,,620,4.132231404958677
8617144,5,B00FNFJH7Y,Great documentary on his life. A huge variety of footage from his youth till his death. What a risk taker!! Most of the footage is excellent photography.,1428364800,,153,4.703703703703703
8617145,5,B00FNFJH7Y,"Once you start watching this you will be mesmerized ------ even if you are not into skiing. Even if you are not REMOTELY INTO SKIING or winter sports. You're in for the ride of your life.  My thinking while watching this ""where did this guy come from"" ------- "" an alien from another planet""?  Shane McConkey is nothing short of SUPER HUMAN. Where does this kind of motivation and energy come from? I have no idea because ""it ain't in me"". I would give anything to have an ounce of his enthusiasm, energy, and motivation. Just watching Shane McConkey literally FLY  ------- through this video is --------- JUST WATCH IT!  YOU WON'T BE SORRY.  ( and you will want to watch it again ---- and again.",1424476800,,696,4.492063492063492
8617146,5,B00FNFJH7Y,"Easily the best and most inspiring DVD I have ever purchsed.  Saw the move at the Flagstaff Film Festival and had to buy it.

8617149,5,B00FNFJH7Y,"It's a shame that stars of this caliber have to burn out so quickly.  Shane was a credit to his sport.  I've followed his carrier over the years and he has always been one of my favorites to watch.  although a bit sad, I would recommend this movie to anyone that craves a periodic adrenalin rush.  We miss you Shane!",1402963200,,316,4.216666666666667
