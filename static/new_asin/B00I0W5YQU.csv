8638137,3,B00I0W5YQU,"Given the talent involved-- several seriously major actors-- I was surprised at the over all mediocrity of the movies. There is not one that I'd care to see again.  On a positive note the print quality of each movie is quite good and the sound is clear; however I could detect no stereo beyond an occasional hint.  Also I suspect that The Circuit was edited for television: there are a couple of scenes that end without resolution (one a beginning nudity scene, the other a death scene that begins but ends before the actual killing-- rather coy for an action movie).  Also there are short ""fade to blacks"" which suggest commercial breaks.

I bought the set at a dollar store.  I don't feel cheated but I wouldn't pay Amazon's current $12 price.",1509580800,,745,4.613636363636363
