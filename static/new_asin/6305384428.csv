Sadly but understandably, this kind of premium content has all but disappeared from YouTube and YouTube Kids leaving children only mind-numbing content like Eastern European webjunk versions of Wheels on the bus and videos of people spending 10 hours opening Pokemon card packs as studios have realized that YouTubers rather than themselves have been monetizing their premium conent all these years.

There needs to be a low-cost digital-only solution for videos like this. They're not going to be remastered and re-released umpteen-zillion times like Disney's Cinderella but children love this kind of stuff anyways. Little hands scratch DVD's to death so they only work for a little while and VCR's stopped being manufactured last year so VHS isn't viable.  The downloaded YouTube video of an uploaded digitized VHS copy of this title, on the other hand, has entertained my six toddlers for eight years outlasting 3 desktop PC's since I backed up all their YouTube cartoons on external drives. I was very fortunate to get a Uebo M200 media player back then for $70 that plugs right in to the back of our flatscreen TV via HDMI so they've been able to watch all the old YouTube premium content offline on-demand for years. As a legally-blind stay-at-home dad on a very tight budget, not having to pay subscription fees to watch stuff like this (if it is ever even made available) has been a godsend.",1510185600,,1613,4.926470588235294

My 18 month old Evan loves the ""puppy"" and it is nice that it is in several 5 minute segments, in case you don't want your child to watch a whole half hour at a time.  Be  forwarned - your child may get addicted to ""puppy"".  Fast forward  through the previews...",945734400,6,293,4.0701754385964914
7888305,5,6305384428,"My 2-year-old daughter absolutely loves this video!  If we would let her, she would watch this nonstop all day.  It is an extremely well made video and is designed to help children learn about basics like kindness and  putting others first.  I highly recommend this to other parents.",943228800,10,283,4.833333333333333
