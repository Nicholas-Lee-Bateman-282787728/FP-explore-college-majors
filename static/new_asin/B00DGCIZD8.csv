5796099,1,B00DGCIZD8,"One review of this film on the web called it a ""guilty pleasure"" for HBO fans.  A guilty pleasure, indeed.

David Mamet has written some interesting screenplays (""The Untouchables"", ""Hoffa"") but I can't help but wonder just what he was up to here.  Phil Spector, producer of some great music, was obviously pretty disturbed throughout his whole life.  Joey Ramone once told Rolling Stone that Spector told him: ""I'm worried about going to Hell, because I'd be worse than the Devil.""  Ramone also told that same magazine that he had once put a gun to the singer's head, demanding a blowjob.  Actually he'd done this six or seven times throughout his life--mostly to women, though.  Spector was an angry recluse who could never stay close to anyone in his life because of his grievous mental illness, drug addictions, and huge ego.  The reason he killed Lana Clarkson is because she didn't recognize him when he went to the House of Blues and she was a waitress.  An actress who never quite made  it, she had bit roles in films like Scarface.  To Mamet, who has always espoused a philosophy of ""the free market"" and called none other than Thomas Sowell one of the ""greatest minds of our time"", this makes her irrelevant.  A musical genius can kill a less talented person because that less talented person just isn't as important, after all.

All we see in Mamet's ""film"" is a kindly eccentric who feels left behind by time.  I'm kinda surprised Pacino took this role, but the only thing more comical than this desperate grab for attention is the wig that hangs on his head.  (You see, Phil Spector wore that to his trial in order to imitate Jimi Hendrix and his protest of government surveillance.  So, who really cares if he shot a woman in the mouth?)

None other than mob lawyer scumbag Bruce Cutler is even given a friendly treatment in this movie, though I must say Jeffrey Tampor's bit performance as John Gotti's alter ego is better than Helen Mirren's, who is barely acting, really.  She's just there for screen time with Pacino.
Mamet engages in some speculative nonsense about how because Spector was three feet away from Clarkson, well, he couldn't have shot her according to the laws of physics.  That night he stumbled out of his house with Lana Clarkson's blood all over his shirt and told his driver, ""I think I just killed somebody.""  This guy is guiltier than Robert Blake.

I wouldn't be surprised if Mamet had Spector himself write some of this garbage from prison.  The true implication of the film is that Lana Clarkson doesn't matter, in the end.  All that matters is that the goof with the wig on was there when John Lennon wrote his song ""Imagine"".  This disgusted me, particularly considering the caliber of the actors and actresses involved.",1373414400,14,2765,4.700623700623701

Al Pacino definitely humanized Phil Spector for the big screen. It's obvious that Phil Spector is a musical genius, but a very troubled individual.

5796144,3,B00DGCIZD8,"Storyline never really grips the viewer. Pacino gives a good portrayal of the flawed, egomaniac Spector. Mirren performs ably as his attorney /confidante who comes to believe her client is innocent.  Best scenes are those in which Mirren reveals Spector to himself. Just not enough here to make a great movie from a sad story.",1468540800,,326,4.927272727272728
5796145,5,B00DGCIZD8,"Helen Mirren was in it, what more can I say?  No, really, it was a good production, very well played, though Helen out acted most, Pacino for sure, though he probably played the extremely odd phil Spector as well as anyone could possibly.  It was very watchable, no boring stretches.  It starts by showing a disclaimer that it's all a made up story not based on any facts (I paraphrase).  The story followed the facts I know about, with exception of the parts that aren't public information; private conversations, etc..  It's logical and believable, and offered me a scenario by which a smart attorney like Linda Kenney Baden could've possibly believed the deranged Phil Spector may not have been responsible for the death of Lana Clarkson, which I have wondered about.  I do recommend this movie, I liked it a lot..",1468540800,,817,4.75886524822695

5796174,4,B00DGCIZD8,"Some brilliant acting moments by Helen Mirren and Al Pacino along with some powerful philosophical insights into the nature of human behavior.  The film itself asks the viewer to see it as a fictional piece, yet somehow the viewer succumbs to the story, engaging in the ""who and what the story is based upon"".  Separating what is real and what is not real is as questionable as to whether the character is guilty of the crime he is accused, beyond a reasonable doubt.",1466726400,,467,4.614457831325301

Al Pacino and Helen Mirren gave outstanding performance in their roles. Although it wasn't a 'true' movie, it is definitely a great movie worth watching.

He made strange choices that were not in his best interest , stranger because of who he was and how he'd removed himself from the public. I can ony wonder the difference between the 1st and second trials. Did he get the brunt of a court system who set OJ Free and felt they had to make up for it to regain respect using Phil Spector? Helen Mirran Shines! He would have walked had she been well enough for the second trial.",1465257600,,567,4.514563106796117

5796272,5,B00DGCIZD8,"I have always been a huge David Mamet fan but, to be honest, his films of the last several years have left a bit to be desired. (The  dialogue and scripts were too choppy; the plots, a bit weak.) Here, though, we have a Mamet film that really has Mamet doing what he does best - creating really good, forward-moving dialogue around a really intriguing plot.

The plot centers around the first murder trial of Phil Spector, seen through the eyes of Spector's defense team. This intriguing angle is largely responsible for the film's uniqueness. Helen Mirren does a fantastic job as the lead defense lawyer who, at first, does not want to take the case, but gradually sympathizes with Spector and fears that without a good defense, a jury might convict him for his eccentricities alone. She and her defense team are determined not to see that happen, so they develop a defense not only based on (their interpretation of) the facts, but allowing the jury to learn about the human side of Spector. The question up until the very end of the film: put the unpredictable Phil Spector (played by an impeccable Al Pacino) on the stand?

I found the film quite riveting. Mamet creates a forceful forward motion with his rapid-fire dialogue punctuated by emotion-filled monologues (usually by Spector). The plot is both an interesting who-dunnit as well as a psychological exploration of Spector. All in all, a really good film that (at least to me) finds Mamet recapturing some of that ""Glengary Glenn Ross"" magic.",1395273600,7,1504,4.7992277992278
5796273,4,B00DGCIZD8,"Simple, low-budgety, but very realistic little docu-drama. Pacino really shines as Spector, and Helen Mirren is similarly good as defense attorney Linda Kelley Baden. Much of it consists of private conferences between Spector and Baden, as well as between Baden and her cohort attorneys. Though it shows nothing in the way of flashback to the alleged crime and little of the actual trial, PHIL SPECTOR is very revealing of the games and agendas that are so often involved in criminal prosecutions, especially when they are high in profile and/or involve celebrities. It's also a strong character study of a super-arrogant, often downright repellent man who possesses some nonetheless admirable qualities.",1394582400,,704,5.409090909090909

Thrilled with the film and it was simply marvelous.  The acting by Al Pacino (Phil Spector) and Mirren (attorney Linda Baden) were extremely convincing.  The writing is also excellent.",1392249600,10,493,4.903614457831325
5796276,4,B00DGCIZD8,"This movie is not what I expected.  I anticipated the usual depiction of the crime, trial and outcome.  Lana Clarkson is only a footnote in the movie.  The movie is really about Phil Spector and explaining why he is the way he is, how he came to murder this actress.  It is equally about Linda Kenney Baden the defense attorney who takes the case over from star attorney Bruce Cutler who got John Gotti off.  It wasn't what I expected. For the sliver of the case that is depicted, it is well done.  Overall it is excellent in what it portrays about the case. Al Pacino's portrayal of Phil Spector is flawless and inspiring. I really felt I got what the deal was with Phil Spector after watching it. The music is powerful and beautiful.

The outrageous personality of Phil Spector is certainly balanced by the understated but strong character of Ms. Mirren, whose life-threatening issues are subjugated by her professional responsibilities to her client.

5796282,5,B00DGCIZD8,WELL DONE. GREAT MATERIAL. FILLED IN THE BLANKS OF MOST LIKELY HAPPENED IN THAT STRANGE HOUSE.  STRANGE BUT INTERESTING STORY.,1383868800,,126,5.3
5796283,4,B00DGCIZD8,"David Mamet, the writer and director of this film, is not known for conventional work.  He has won the Pulitizer Prize in the past so he is a thinking person's crime director. His film is about Spector's elusive character and his defense counsel's attempt to come to know him so as to better defend him. Al Pacino and Helen Mirren play these characters very well. This is a very subtle work, especially for a murder case.

If a defense attorney is going to win a murder case, the number one factor is whether she has total control over her client.  If the client says to the defense attorney, Tell me what to do and say. I am putty in your hands,"" she or he is in the strongest position for winning.

Most show biz defendants have way too much ego to ever be able to say this. Thus they are wild cards for defense counsel to handle throughout the trial. Spector's ego thus becomes the third person in this drama. That ""third person"" is the most fascinating.

If you are looking for standard legal fare, this is not it. Mamet is once again interested in peeling back the lid of the criminal justice system and looking at the dark belly of the defendant and his lawyer. He did this with the real estate industry in GLEN GARY GLEN ROSS and with malpractice law when he wrote THE VERDICT (Sidney Lumet's film).

Did Mamet solve the case for the audience? No. You are still left guessing. He doesn't know and doesn't guess. If you are looking for answers, this isn't the movie for you and Mamet isn't the writer or director for you either.

5796286,3,B00DGCIZD8,"This movie starts with a disclaimer: ""This is a work of fiction. It's not 'based on a true story.' It is a drama inspired by actual persons in a trail, but it is neither an attempt to depict the actual persons, nor to comment upon the trail or it's outcome."" Having read this, and then watched the movie, I don't understand why the  ""true story"" and the ""actual persons"" were not deemed interesting enough to be the source. Why not just present the story as it was? Beyond that, the disclaimer seems contradictory. If it's not based on a true story, what is it based on?

Throughout the movie, the Spector character bemoans the fact that he is being singled out because he was successful; that past great personalities were similarly persecuted because they were ""too big for their britches.""  In addition, his character proposes that there is no reportable news unless a person of character is perceived to deviate from their ""normal"" behavior. Whether or not the real Spector said this, the movie just proves this point; apparently, all of Spector's previous accomplishments were not enough to warrant a bio-pic, but the ""crash and burn"" moment of a successful--albeit eccentric--man, were.

Motivation and necessity of this movie aside, I was somewhat surprised of the caliber of casting. Helen Mirren does a fine job of portraying Spector's attorney--though we may never really know what the real attorney's feelings and contributions were, as this film was a ""drama inspired by actual persons.""  Al Pacino (!) plays Spector. He does a good job of portraying an eccentric character, but I never got past that this was Al Pacino in essentially a made-for-TV movie.

There's no suspense in this movie. It ends rather abruptly and then includes summative sentences to explain what happens after the events portrayed in the movie. This film did nothing to move me emotionally regarding Spector or Lana Clarkson. If a film cannot add something to someone's legacy, evoke empathy, or stir conversation, then what's the point?",1380585600,,2023,4.970414201183432

5796288,3,B00DGCIZD8,"This was a story that mesmerized entertainment junkies several years ago, but I found it vaguely unsatisfying in a lot of respects. Pacino and Mirren were outstanding in their portrayals of the principals, but the program wasn't long enough or deep enough to really show how these people got to where they were. The dissection of Phil Spector's character was interesting, but who was Linda Kenney-Baden that she was sought out for her contribution to his defense? And who was Lana Clarkson and how did she end up dead in that mansion? Helen Mirren can do just about anything on stage or screen, including look frumpy and deathly ill without self-consciousness. I liked her performance, but it was basically limited to the immediacy of that investigation and trial, and I would've preferred more. That's not her fault -- or for that matter Pacino's, who can also inhabit any character -- but maybe a longer, deeper production would've better suited my expectations. Nevertheless, I'm glad I watched it.",1379548800,8,1001,5.0
5796289,1,B00DGCIZD8,"Forget the subject matter of this film, which writer/ director David Mamet describes as mythological interpretation rather than facts about Phil Spector's first trial which ended in a mistrial.

 The bad thing about this movie is the acting!  This is the absolute worst performance I have ever seen from Helen Mirren and Al Pacino!

David Mamet should give all of his play-writing awards back after this fiasco!  Looks like he was directing it from under one of Phil Spector's wigs while wearing Spector's rose-colored glasses.  Too bad Spector didn't produce it, it probably would have been better!

 Mamet begins his film with the card, ""This is a work of fiction. It's not 'based on a true story.' It is a drama inspired by actual persons in a trial, but it is neither an attempt to depict the actual persons, nor to comment upon the trial or its outcome.""

He should have started the film with ""This is a piece of crap depicting some great actors in the worst performance of their lives, turn off your TV now!""

Save your money!",1378944000,4,1032,4.683333333333334
8592926,4,B00DGCIZD8,"""The truth is somewhere in the mix,"" indeed, but this difficult film asks a lot of questions without presenting much in the way of answers. In the end, though, so much about seminal producer Phil Spector's life is fascinating and could've been illuminated well by a long, detailed documentary-esque film featuring these talented stars. Instead, Helen Mirren and Al Pacino do their best presenting the little snippet of history after Spector was charged with murder but before the trial ended.

Both those two powerhouse performers as well as the many actors and actresses who play the smaller parts do a fantastic job. That's not the problem. The fundamental issue remains that Spector is a Spinx-like character with a lot of contradictory aspects to him, the man mixing talented ambition with horrific callousness, and all that the movie does is poke around at some of the edges. It's worth watching, in the end, but it's flawed in a way that's somewhat disappointing.",1525651200,,969,5.0186335403726705
