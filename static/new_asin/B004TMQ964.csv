8639211,5,B004TMQ964,"Who discusses Hell?  Aside from the authors of the Old and New Testament, and a few savvy Pastors - no one.  That's right, no one discusses Hell.  We must admit too that few of us read the Bible.  Therefore, we are indeed lucky that Pastor James MacDonald not only tackles this terrifying subject, but, through scripture, is able to make it easy to understand.
No matter how sophisticated, how relevant, how yawningly hip we think we are, we are all secretly terrified by death and Hell. Would it not be wonderful then if we found an answer to this question?  Better yet, if we discovered there is still hope for us - in the here and now - whether or not we are able to fully read or understand the Bible?

We thank God and Pastor James for this clear sermon.  If you are expecting to die, take a few minutes and watch, I'm glad I did.  The broad road leading to destruction is as true today as when it was first breathed by the Holy Spirit through the various prophets, tax-collectors, fishermen, kings, doctors and others who wrote the God-inspired books of the Old and New Testament.

God Loves You and wants you to hear His Word.  Please watch.",1356393600,,1148,4.423809523809524
