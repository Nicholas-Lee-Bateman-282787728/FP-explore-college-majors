3417633,5,B0018KVL5O,GREAT PRICE!  This was delivered on time and arrived in great shape.  I fiancee was very excited to unwrap it.  Thanks so much for a great product.  He's been watching these non-stop and isn't halfway through them.  We have already gone back to some as reference.  These will be great to review over the years.  And the price just couldn't be beat.,1231632000,4,348,4.516129032258065
3417634,5,B0018KVL5O,"Science, food, and fun.  Brown demystifies cooking as he explains why cooks do what they do.  It is hard to image a more enjoyable way to learn to cook.  On DVD you can pause and rewind to review the details that sometimes get lost as you enjoy the show.",1230336000,4,254,4.142857142857143

8269907,5,B0018KVL5O,"This isn't a review, as I don't have Season 2 yet.  My Mom got me Season 1 for Christmas 2011, and I was looking forward to picking up the rest of the series.  I don't want it piecemeal, by topic.  I really want it as a whole series.  I may also, at some point, buy it by topic for easier reference, but I really enjoy it as a show, as well as learning so much for it.

Now that the seasons are impossible to get, the price on Season 2 is out of control!  There's no way, I could ever afford it now!  :(

Please bring back ALL the seasons of Good Eats in the season formats!",1357344000,4,574,3.8461538461538463
8269908,5,B0018KVL5O,These videos are entertaining and practical.  We could even use them in our homeschool as they teach a lot about the science of things.,1267833600,,135,4.625
8269909,4,B0018KVL5O,"This is a great collection but not nearly complete... plus there are a couple of duplicate dvd's... Plus it's missing important collections like Thanksgiving and xmas... Alton Brown rocks and this set will definitely give you great insight, techniques and recipes... but the duplicates and omissions make me wonder if there is a better collection out there.",1259712000,,357,5.280701754385965

8269911,3,B0018KVL5O,"Edit:  OMG AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!  After e-mailing Barb @ purple turtle, she responded the next day and arranged to replace the duplicate DVD with the missing DVD from the set.  at no extra cost!  Seriously, who does that in this economy.  If I could edit my star ratings I would.  I would totally recommend buying from this vendor based on the speed and professional behavior I experienced.  I had that warm and fuzzy consumer experience!

Positives:
Holy moley, the best customer service I've experienced in a while.

The Holiday Treats DVD!  This is probably the most useful episode for Thanksgiving. We used this episode as a guide last year and had the juiciest turkey EVER.

Negatives:
 I received two copies of the ""Tossed Around"" DVD.  So I'm wondering what DVD I didn't receive since I still have a total of 24 DVD. (Edit: It was Veggie Eats #1)

If I could change one thing about this listing for future customers I would have had the DVD title listed rather than the individual episode titles in the product description.  (There are three episodes per DVD)

Overall, its a great deal for any Alton Brown fan.  There's value in getting 24 CD's rather than buying them individually, however the missing DVD leave me HUNGRY FOR MORE.  (Sorry I couldn't help myself.)

Edit:  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEFT ME SATISFIED! ha ha.",1252627200,2,1336,4.776315789473684

8269915,5,B0018KVL5O,"This DVD set is exactly as described -- plenty of Good Eats episodes on demand.  Each disk only contains three episodes (which run twenty minutes without commercials) but each episode also includes ten-fifteen minutes of Alton Brown addressing questions about that episode that have been sent in by viewers.  As an extra bonus, the DVD booklets include the recipes.",1235088000,13,365,5.169491525423729
