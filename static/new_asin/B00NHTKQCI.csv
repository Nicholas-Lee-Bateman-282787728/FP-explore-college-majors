8678295,5,B00NHTKQCI,"I have been a huge Saint Seiya fan since the original airing of the series in Japan, way before the series showed up in the US.  Besides Lost Canvas, Legend of Sanctuary is my most favorite.  I was excited to finally see this off of the computer and was beyond delighted when I viewed this on my HD TV.  The intensity of the colors and the CGI effects are breathtaking!  Though many still prefer the original designs of the Saints and the story line, Legend brings a new idea to the series and the characters.  In fact, Legend adds to the personality of the Saints, as well as the  expressions that a basic anime can often lack.  Though I wish Legend was extended to include more of the original Sanctuary series and interactions, I am beyond happy. :)",1439683200,11,752,4.405797101449275
