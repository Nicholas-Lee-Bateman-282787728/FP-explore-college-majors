2925185,3,B000UUCSLE,"I am interested in the possibility of their being other life ""out there""... But I always wonder, why with our great advances in technology can't we film or shoot a picture of pure clarity ? Even today, pictures, films, etc, always are blurry or distorted in some fashion ?",1379980800,,272,4.571428571428571

2925187,5,B000UUCSLE,This is probably the best video I've ever seen on UFO's. The DVD was brand new and came very well packaged and protected.,1366329600,,121,4.304347826086956
2925188,3,B000UUCSLE,I purchased it because I wanted it either for my self or a friend or a family member. I graded it with the number of stars I thought it deserved from my view point and that is all I'm willing to do.  You are wadting my time and yours asking for more than that.,1359590400,,260,3.814814814814815
2925189,4,B000UUCSLE,"There are a lot of legitimate criticisms leveled at this ABC program from 2005 hosted by Peter Jennings, such as the pat inclusion of the SETI folks who do a nice stand in for Philip Klass - smugly alluding that we untermensch are easily fooled by full moons, and that if there are any ET's then they will be the first to clue us in. And the standard recap of UFO history starting with Kenneth Arnold - yawn... But the fact that the producers did spend a fair amount of time on a couple of really solid cases makes this video important to have. In particular is their coverage of the Phoenix Lights and their witness interviews, the string of sightings by civilians and police just southeast of East St. Louis and those interviews, along with the most important case to have folks on the record for - the Minot AFB sighting. The Minot case is not a well known case. The weight of ABC clearly got these guys to come forward and talk about this on camera. It is fantastic to hear the accounts from these solid witnesses and see the CG recreations. The recreations - for all of the cases - are first rate. Another very tantalizing segment in the show is an interview montage with a half dozen or more airline pilots recounting their sightings. How wonderful it would have been if the DVD came with an ""extras"" package that let these pilot interviews play out in long form. A little more from these pilots and a little less of the UFO history and the debunkers would have been a nice trade off. So, in closing, there is a bunch of historical recap that is a bit redundant, and too much of the science community types giving the same old tired refutations, but...  For the priceless gems that I have mentioned, makes this DVD a must have and it stands as an important document in UFO history. Be aware that when ordering this DVD - that it is ""On Demand"" - that is to say, they burn the DVD when you order it. Mine had some video artifacts, but not enough to make me want to return it. Overall good quality.",1357171200,10,2002,4.352941176470588
2925190,5,B000UUCSLE,"I absolutely love this program. The interviews with the commercial and military pilots, who were all eyewitnesses to UFOs, make it well worth the price. I also love the section with the truck driver, group of cops, and the 911 tapes about a sighting in Illinois. The scientists come off the worst -- they have already defined everything and refuse to accept eyewitness accounts. SETI has searched for many years for an alien civilization broadcasting with radio technology -- what if the aliens have advanced beyond that??!! The best scientist is the physicist at the end who says most people slam the door on UFOs because they think space travel is not possible, and that any aliens would be just like us, only a few hundred years advanced -- he says open your mind, open your consciousness to the fact that an alien civilization might be a million years ahead of us. Love it. Peter Jennings did an outstanding job as the narrator.",1341792000,2,932,4.723926380368098
2925191,1,B000UUCSLE,"Mainstream media bias, that is. I find it absurd that NONE of the so-called skeptics interviewed brought up even just one challenging or unexplainable case. There are plenty of intriguing, unexplainable cases, but the skeptics featured in this program obviously could not be bothered with the facts because their minds had already been made up. The most laughable comments came from some of the so-called ""scientists"", one of whom related a story about how she thought the moon was an ufo at first! While listening to her, I was thinking: How dumb can she be to mistaken the moon for an ufo? How dumb must a person be to even think that such a ridiculous example is a competent analogy to any of the unexplained cases? I find it appalling that most of the ""scientists"" in this program lack the basic spirit of science. How could you even call yourself a person of science when your mind is kept wide shut?! What vein or lineage of the scientific tradition do you claim your association when you jump to judgment before investigating?

I used to have high respect for Peter Jennings, but a man is judged by his actions and the company he keeps. Having the poor judgment to give overwhelmingly skewed air time to buffoons masquerading as ""scientists"" and ""skeptics"", he just proved to me that he is definitely not an independent thinker.

This program should only be rated ""J"" for joke.",1327276800,3,1384,4.714876033057851
2925192,1,B000UUCSLE,"Hey folks. this sad, ignorant show is what happens when you get a highly paid talking head who does no research of his own, beamed into your living room. If you want to keep your head in the sand (or worse places) about UFO's and the Shadow Gov't coverup for 60+ years, then buy this and tell your friends. If you want the real gold, read ""Exempt From Disclosure"", any books by Timothy Goode, Dr. Steve Greer, Frank Edwards, Maj Donald Keyhoe, Richard Dolan. The ET's have been here for maybe 25,000 years, keeping us from destroying each other and Earth. Pass on Peter ""Give me another cigarette"" Jennings. I hope he's had a change of mind since he's on the Other Side. AMFAA",1188691200,4,676,4.459677419354839

2925194,4,B000UUCSLE,"So, you have scientists saying they don't believe in extraterrestrial craft because there's no proof. You have documentation (RADAR proof) and eyewitness accounts from professional military personnel. Then you have Project Blue Book saying that all these 16 professional military men saw was stars...RADAR evidence be damned. Just trying to get the facts down here folks.",1408492800,,371,5.642857142857143

8214817,1,B000UUCSLE,"As a swan song for Jennings, this is a major disappointment. Instead of interviewing those who have spent years meticulously researching this subject, they bring on a variety of the tin foil hat brigade. It was embarrassing.
One got the feeling that Jennings' hands were tied on this one.",1431388800,,288,4.8979591836734695

8214819,3,B000UUCSLE,"Pretty good show.

Didn't extrapolate the extensive USAF cover up with Major Jesse Marcell (-1sp), beyond the obvious. Would've been interesting to see a time-line documentation of facts vs lies (subsequently spewed by USAF generals), indicating at what point & who was responsible for each cover up. They mentioned a few names, but it didn't emphasize the breaking point(s).

But an enjoyable viewing.

Always liked Peter Jennings.",1413158400,,432,5.417910447761194
