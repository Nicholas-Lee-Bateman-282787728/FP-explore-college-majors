So many memories that I had forgotten.  Yeah, friendship meant more back then. Great acting by casts.",1375315200,,280,4.957446808510638

5371081,5,B009XICRUG,"I am a Korean born in the U.S. I'm not used to Korean movies. But I've watched a handful and I enjoyed watching them.  Most of the Korean movies I saw had Jang Dong Gun as the star- such as Friend.  Korean movies are low budget in comparison to American movies.  And they have a dramatization that may seem cheesy or overly romanticized.  But, I get it.  Koreans in Korea are more open than Americans, particularly when it comes to their ""boys.""  So, the kinship that you in movies reflect the closeness that men have with each other, that feels different than the strong American men relationship that us Americans are accustomed to.
Anyways, I enjoyed the movie.  I am Korean, so take that into consideration. I'd watch it again.",1365033600,12,731,4.576923076923077
5371082,5,B009XICRUG,"Friend follows four friends, with different personalities, from childhood to adulthood, as their friendships are tested- and they are tested constantly. Friend is an excellent story of friendship, loyalty, and betrayal.

The story in Friend goes over a large time span, from the 70s to 90s. It shows the strength of their relationship, during their happiest moments and their roughest times, and the decisions they make and how they affect each other. Their bond is tested even further when two of the friends become rival gang bosses. Themes of loyalty and betrayal are evident. The ending of the film is also compelling. The movie really succeeds in making the audience question the definition of ""Friend"". The film blends drama, some action, and some comedy to make a balanced experience; the pacing is also smooth and consistent. The acting is superb from the entire cast. The music is also excellent- it fit perfectly in many scenes. There are a few ideas and concepts it throws in but never fully tackles; however, I didn't see this as a major issue.

Overall, Friend is an amazing film about friendship that uses its drama, action, and light comedy to create an effective and unforgettable experience. As of 3/16/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, and a purchase is highly recommended.

Friend has strong violence and blood, and some nudity.",1363737600,14,1371,5.004385964912281

5371089,5,B009XICRUG,"I am of the older generation who enjoyed the movie series ""The Godfather"". That was a story of the Corleone family of their rise to power to become the Godfather the boss of bosses. It features the story of brothers, kinship, differences, strengths, weaknesses and betrayals. It was their story that mesmerized me. In this movie which has a sequel Friend 2, it is the story of friends, their relationships. their loyalties and weaknesses and betrayals. It is also set in an era of change where a land was just getting revived from the past devastation of war and division of North and south. As the young boys discussed the North were supplied by weapons by Russia and the South by the USA and a question SAYS WHO?? Considering the background and the timeline of the story, I thought this was a very well written and well portrayed story. It is an unfolding fo a part of history of that city of Busan. Highly recommend this movie.",1475971200,,930,4.574850299401198
5371090,5,B009XICRUG,"This movie was brilliant. I loved the way they showed their growing up together and how their choices etched their future in stone. Well made, acting was spot on, and the soundtrack wasn't half bad. Deserves five stars and then some.",1474675200,,233,4.7073170731707314

5371092,3,B009XICRUG,"I'm a big fan of Korean movies, as many have better story telling and acting, then most big budget Hollywood films. Although this move was well acted, and filmed well, I had some trouble connecting with the plot. I've seen many similar movies through the years of childhood friends that grow apart, non-family ""brotherhood"", or loyalty films. However, this movie didn't really work for me. Maybe it is purely a cultural ting (although I doubt it, since I connect with a lot of Korean movies). Or maybe the subtiles weren't accurate enough. I would rate this movie lower except for the acting. The plot/storytelling deserved a 1 star.",1470960000,,633,4.87037037037037

5371097,5,B009XICRUG,"Superb story about friendship and gangster life.

I watched this movie long time ago (almost ten years ago) and watched it again today. Before I glorified the friendship and men doing their thing to set their destinies. But now as I got more mature, I realize that this is a very sad story about poor education/ environment, crime, and corruption. The sad fact is that this vicious cycle still exists in this world.

In terms of acting and plot, the movie is A++. All the acting is well choreographed. I really like all the actors. The cinematography is exceptional, specially the death scene (no spoiler alert).

I highly recommend watching this movie. Even though you don't understand Korean or Korean culture, you will feel something and see the sadness.",1463529600,8,757,4.852713178294573

5371103,5,B009XICRUG,"The movie depicts brotherhood in a style probably unfamiliar to American viewers. The background - Korea's encountering of modernity - is complex enough to allow characters to have different life paths that may otherwise be implausible in the traditional society. Not only that, the movie raises questions about human nature and an essential aspect of Asian culture in general - humility and identity. This is a ""simple"" movie that leaves a lot of afterthoughts.",1451347200,2,462,5.256756756756757

5371123,4,B009XICRUG,I primarily watched this because I like actor Jang Dong Gun.  If he had not been cast in this part I wouldn't have watched it.  He was true to the gangster character.  I've only seen him in more current movies where he was not a killer.  It was good to see him as a man trying to survive the only way he knew how to in his limited and uneducated environment in which he had grown up.  He is a very great actor.,1400716800,2,410,3.891566265060241

5371125,3,B009XICRUG,"Although this movie is rated a classic in Korean film making ,I found it a little hard to watch at times.
It is rather violent. Very raw.
There are a lot of emotions and feelings involved .It was a very a different climate of time.
Poverty runs through the movie. Therefore, the decisions these young boys make for themselves.
It is an interesting movie from a social perspective.
Could any of these young boys have come to a different decision.
They all came out of the same environment.
At times it is rather slow,you have to have some patience.

5371132,5,B009XICRUG,"There isn't a person in Korea over 13 who hasn't seen this movie. This movie, to say the least, is generally considered a classic and perhaps the greatest movie Korea has ever produced. But I would be short-changing this movie by saying it is a great Korean cinema, it is really a great cinema by any standards.

The characters really captures your emotions. The friendships between the main characters really start to matter. The movie takes about 30 minutes to hit its stride, but once it does, it is hard to stop watching, even after watching the same scenes repeatedly.

This is not a romantic movie. It isn't a comedy. It isn't about the modern Korea and its ""gangnam style"" culture. If you want to know what is hip in current Korea, you will be disappointed.

To understand the complexity of this movie, it really helps to have some understanding of the Korean culture and how it has evolved since the 1970's.

There are lot of deletes scenes in the theatrical release which has been included in the Amazon ""prime"" version. That in itself makes this movie worth watching again.

I highly recommend this film.

Pros:
1)Widely considered a classic and one of the greatest cinema Korea has ever produced.
2)Deeply engaging. It can be emotionally difficult to watch.
3)Includes many deleted scenes which adds to an already engaging story.

Cons:
1)The quality of the picture in the ""prime"" version is not stellar. It is far below HDTV quality.",1377907200,4,1445,4.779116465863454
