3702953,5,B001MYIQKO,"I didn't actually get the DVD yet, considering it doesn't come out until 4 months. But I think that if you are interested into science, astronomy, and mind boggling ideas this would be great. This was one of the best science shows I have ever seen.",1228608000,,248,4.413043478260869

3702975,5,B001MYIQKO,"This video was shown on TV a few weeks ago and I knew I had to have it. Beautiful display of the planets and a great narration by Alec Baldwin.
This is a MUST SEE for anyone who wants to know whats out there!",1452124800,,208,3.75
3702976,5,B001MYIQKO,One of the best space documentaries around! Bought to help me fall asleep on trips.  Alec Baldwin has the perfect voice !,1452038400,,121,4.5
3702977,5,B001MYIQKO,"I first bought his new from Amazon.  It wouldn't work in my Blu-ray player.  Returned it for a refund.  Then bought it again ""used"" from goHastings
It now works just fine.",1449360000,,171,4.451612903225806
3702978,5,B001MYIQKO,The narration is well done and the length is nice. I like that it goes well beyond the solar system to the edges of the Universe.  The Universe; there are no words that explain how Magnificent it is.,1448323200,,199,4.2368421052631575
3702979,5,B001MYIQKO,Absolutely amazing. Makes you realise how small we are in the scheme of things. If it were only available in 3d......,1448150400,,117,4.619047619047619
3702980,5,B001MYIQKO,"Absolutely, without a doubt, captivating from beginning to end!  Alec Baldwin is supurbly cast in the role of narrator...",1440374400,,121,5.368421052631579
3702981,5,B001MYIQKO,One of the best blu rays to explore our universe with!  Also...the best 420 flick you can buy!  Play it with Dark Side!,1437782400,,119,4.130434782608695

3702994,5,B001MYIQKO,Interesting,1418688000,,11,11.0
3702995,5,B001MYIQKO,"Outstanding series!  Highly informative, but entertainingly and dynamically  transports the viewer throughout the Cosmos to study what we've learned, and the mysteries still being explored.",1417910400,,189,6.52
3702996,5,B001MYIQKO,"I love this show so i had to buy it, lowest price at amazon",1413072000,,59,3.2857142857142856
3702997,3,B001MYIQKO,"Not much to say - if you have seen the other reviews you may have figured out what I am about to say.  Too much fancy not enough fact.  Hey, it looks awesome.  And Alec Baldwin has a great voice and has narrated some great stuff.  But the lines they gave him made him sound more like a tour guide than a person teaching us about the universe.  And there also seemed to be a lot of dead time - when they just tried to let the visuals speak for themselves - and it just didn't work for me.  At 90 minutes it feel too long, with not enough real interesting information, and I came away without learning anything new.  Once again, I love Alec Baldwin, when he hosted one of the versions of Walking With Cavemen his lines were great.  And the effects on this DVD were wonderful. If watched on a huge TV screen or in a IMAX theater, this would knocked my socks off.  But not very educational.",1412553600,,886,4.1345029239766085
3702998,5,B001MYIQKO,i watch it every 6 months. the very best ever done on this subject.,1412467200,,67,3.857142857142857
3702999,1,B001MYIQKO,This dvd was the lowest of quality ... I tried to play it on my 39 inch tv and it was pixelated sooo bad... I must have been recorded with a potato... this is the 3rd item that I've gotten from amazon that was well just a piece of s***!!,1410739200,,237,3.76
3703000,5,B001MYIQKO,This is almost meditative.  Love it!,1410307200,,36,5.0

3703003,5,B001MYIQKO,Happy with product right on time,1406937600,,32,4.5
3703004,4,B001MYIQKO,This is a Cosmo cruise with very decent graphics and good narration....would be super-awesome in 3D.,1405900800,,100,5.3125
3703005,5,B001MYIQKO,I watched it over and over.  Very well done with great graphics.  None of the boring history of early astronomy.  Very engaging.,1399680000,,128,4.7272727272727275
3703006,4,B001MYIQKO,"I also enjoyed this DVD, with its wonderful graphics and explanations of astronomical phenomena. And it is hosted by Alec Baldwin!",1399075200,,130,5.238095238095238
3703007,4,B001MYIQKO,"I don't know that I agree with everything in this video, but the information about all the planets & stars makes me realize just how great God really is! All of this didn't just ""happen"". There was a force behind it & that force was God!",1398729600,,237,4.173913043478261
3703008,5,B001MYIQKO,"This is a Great Space exploration or journey DVD, The reason is because it is done very well. Alec Baldwin does a fine job in the Narration if you like him or not? put that aside. He takes us through a interesting journey to the Planets and other space objects in the Milky way and beyond. The animation graphics look very nice and add to the enjoyment watching of this documentary. This Space DVD is informative and interesting it makes you think with amazement about our universe and how miniscule we are here in this cosmic soup of planets and galaxies. This is just a wonderful fascinating DVD you can watch over and over to learn and even to relax to .",1397692800,2,657,4.39344262295082
3703009,5,B001MYIQKO,"Alec Baldwin takes us on a journey through space. We see Neil Armstrong's footprints on the moon. Then it is on to Venus, Mercury and the sun. To Mars and the search for extraterrestrial life. The gas giants and Pluto. Interstellar space. Alpha Centauri 25 trillion miles away. Gliese 581. Algol. The Pleiades. Betelgeuse. Orion Nebula. Star birth. White dwarf. Crab Nebula. Supernova. Pulsar spinning 30 times a second. Black hole. Hypernova. We are outside the Milky Way in intergalactic space. Dark matter. Andromeda Galaxy. We see patterns, order in the chaos. Quasar. Countless galaxies. Light. The Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. Baldwin ties mythology and science together with a sense of awe.",1391299200,,701,5.157894736842105
3703010,5,B001MYIQKO,We love National Graphic shows and this is one of our favorites!  Its amazing to see how the universe is out there.  It a very relaxing movie as well.  I say its one of the best Universe shows out there.,1391126400,,203,4.025
3703011,1,B001MYIQKO,The only thing going for this DVD is the quality of the images.  There is no coherent narration.  I hoped to be able to use it in presentations but it is not suitable.  I am disappointed that national Geographic would put their names to it.  I would be happy to send it back!,1387411200,,275,4.132075471698113
3703012,2,B001MYIQKO,"Contains hardley any useful information.  If you have completed elementary school then you already know what will be taught in this DVD.  Besides, Alec Baldwin is WAAAY too much.  Might be a good gag gift.",1384905600,,205,4.8
3703013,5,B001MYIQKO,This is an amazing movie. I will watch it again and again. Not a big Alex Baldwin fan but wow is the universe incredible,1382572800,,120,4.041666666666667
3703014,4,B001MYIQKO,National Geographic always goes above and beyond.  This is a very well done documentary on what is known and what some of the possibilities might be where we are unable to go.  It's fascinating.,1381795200,,194,4.676470588235294
3703015,5,B001MYIQKO,"Regardless of the scientists, etc, out there who know quite a lot more than this provides, to the general audience it is just a fantastic show.  It felt like a 2 hr Cosmos to me.  I thought Baldwin was almost as good as Sagan.  Well, half as good at least.  The pictures and explanations were eerie and easily understood, although as they said, if you think too long, your mind reels.  It was just a beautiful show on a big screen tv.  I went to look for the dvd immediately and ordered it.  One viewing is not enough to digest all of this.  You won't be sorry you took the time to watch it if you are a general audience viewer.",1372464000,,628,4.132231404958677
3703016,3,B001MYIQKO,"I read some good reviews for this one but it was a bit of a let down.  Baldwin's narrative becomes monotonous.  The speculation become dreary & the images predictable. It's ok & worth a watch but you don't walk away wondering & discussing it.  Its like a Chinese meal actually, only you don't want more after you've digested it.",1369526400,,328,4.52542372881356
3703017,5,B001MYIQKO,"I bought this DVD for my husband for his birthday & he was so intrigued, he couldn't stop watching it.  He is an artist & would pause the frame to take pictures.  He was inspired to paint some pics & won first place.  The images mesmerized him as well as educated him.  We enjoy watching it together.",1365552000,,300,4.2105263157894735
3703018,3,B001MYIQKO,"Although I'm a big fan of space, the Universe, etc., I found the narration to be so boring that I fell asleep several times during the presentation.",1364428800,,148,4.518518518518518
3703019,5,B001MYIQKO,"This DVD easily surpassed my wildest expectations.  It is a 90 minute, non-stop CG masterpiece beyond description.  Alec Baldwin does a stellar (pun intended) job of describing not only our known planets in our Milky Way galaxy, but goes much further beyond, literally explaining our very existence back to the known edge of the universe.  The audio sound track is mesmerizing.  This 90 minute video flew by so quickly, it seemed as though it was over in almost an instant.  An absolute MUST for anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in learning more about the universe.  10 stars out of 5!",1362268800,4,600,4.776699029126213
3703020,5,B001MYIQKO,"A great way to escape and see what's out there in our universe.

I recommend this for everyone to watch. It's a fantastic show!!!",1361577600,,129,4.375
3703021,4,B001MYIQKO,"Journey to the Edge of the Universe was very good and entertaining, and i will recommend it to all my friends. I will buy the complete series. It was great.",1359590400,,156,4.233333333333333
3703022,3,B001MYIQKO,"I have watched many documentaries about the universe.  Where the video is visually attractive, the narration and speed of the narration are dull.  My 7 and 5 year old sons sat and watched part of the video before bedtime.  They seemed interested in it, but not sure how long that would last.  The video is informative, but it doesn't reveal any information that I didn't already know.  I wish the narrating would have been faster.  There isn't a lot of science in this video.  It's more about what you might see on the journey to the edge of the universe.  Buy the video for the stunning visual candy and for a simple view of the universe on a kid's level.  Though, I'm uncertain if it would hold a child's attention with the dull narration.",1355184000,,741,4.470149253731344
3703023,5,B001MYIQKO,"My wife and some other reviews disliked this video. I differ. The visuals, music, and the factual information we know about our solar system are accurate as far as I've read. Venus, for example, is a hell hole we once thought might be like a jungle with life. This documentary goes ""as far as we know."" Reviewers and my wife looking for specific answers are out of luck; we have educated guesses, better than the Bible anyway. Black holes, edge of universe, and some kind of God who created it are all up in the air. Scientists including Hawkins are still puzzled and wonder if sending Voyager with directions to Earth might be a bad idea (as stated in the documentary).",1354060800,2,670,4.545454545454546
3703024,5,B001MYIQKO,I got this video as a meditative video and it is awesome!  I watch this and I leave behind this earth and travel far away to distant worlds.  It is truly thought provoking and helps me put things into context.  The visual effects are excellent and Alec Baldwin is a great narrator.,1347408000,,281,4.365384615384615
3703025,5,B001MYIQKO,"If you want a good picture of the universe, this video is for you.  Alec Baldwin is excellent as the narrator.  An enjoyable tour through the universe",1342742400,,150,4.518518518518518
3703026,5,B001MYIQKO,"This DVD has beautiful images of space.  It is very interesting, informative, and entertaining. I highly recommend it. It would be a wonderful gift for anyone that is interested in space.",1341878400,,187,5.032258064516129
3703027,5,B001MYIQKO,"I've seen my fair share of space documentaries and this one is by the far the BEST in terms of production.  If presentation is what they were going for, then they nailed it!  It's almost all CGI comprised yet everything looks real.  It also has great music.  If you own a Blu-ray player you NEED to see this!  I've read some the negative reviews about it and while there isn't a whole lot of ACTUAL science here or even any real pictures from outer space, that wasn't what I was looking for anyway.  I wanted a movie about space that was vivid and colorful.  I wanted a movie that would captivate my imagination and please the senses.  I wanted a movie that would hypothetically freeze time and take me on a voyage through the cosmos so I could see the heavens up close, and in hi-def! And of course, I wanted to hear those cheesy existential questions that make you think along the way!  It's called ""intrigue"" guys.

My only negative input is that it's narrated by Alec Baldwin- but it didn't bother me to the point that I couldn't enjoy the movie.  The visuals alone are what sell it, and personally I think the CG ranks up there with Avatar!  So if a typical made-for-TV space documentary that's more informative than captivating is what you're looking for (which there's nothing wrong with), then by all means pass on this one.  I for one wanted to indulge in the beauty of outer space. I want planets damnit!",1339545600,2,1414,4.455252918287938
3703028,2,B001MYIQKO,"Most thought this was great but I thought they completely dropped the ball on many of the graphics. So much more could have been done to make the cgi more technically accurate. Many planetary surfaces, that we know in great detail, were totally generic without realistic looking scenes. They did the classic mistake of showing the asteroid belt as being heavily littered with flying rocks. True, there are hundreds of thousands but they don't swarm together like a constant meteor shower as the film implied. Also, the scene showing Voyager Leaving the solar system--where particles are even more widely dispersed--showed Voyager basically dodging flying debris constantly. I'm really surprised they left such inaccuracy when the true nature of the scene is clearly and commonly known. I expected much more from the venerable National Geo...",1336694400,4,841,5.2835820895522385
3703029,5,B001MYIQKO,Awesome! have re-watched it dozens of times. incredible animation and Baldwin does a great job narrating. I would recommend this to anyone.,1331424000,,139,5.363636363636363
3703030,4,B001MYIQKO,"I enjoyed what I could view of the ""Journey"", but the picture kept breaking up as if it were scratched or something?  This is the first Blu-Ray title my Oppo BDP-93 could not play without issue; I tried 3 different copies!
Visuals were otherwise very nice as was Alec Baldwin's narration.  This journey is not intended as a fluff piece, but aimed to give you nonstop content along the way.",1326844800,,389,4.542857142857143
3703031,4,B001MYIQKO,"I really never had much of an opinion of Alec Baldwin one way or the other until watching Journey to the Edge of the Universe.  I for one really enjoy his narration in this program.  The program on DVD is very clean and crisp.  The graphics, and images are excellent.  Very quick breaks in DVD between ""scenes"" (where television commercials would be if watching it on National Geographic channel).  The only thing I kind of missed, or that was different on the DVD version than watching it on the National Geographic channel was that some of the music that plays out as each ""scene"" ends (going into each commercial), was pretty much omitted from the DVD.  On the television version, I had grown fond of that music and noticed its abscence from the DVD.  Still a great DVD.",1320796800,,773,4.557971014492754
3703032,2,B001MYIQKO,"OK, so let me start by saying, I was expecting to love this bluray after reading the comments. Boy was I wrong, the tone of the narration is like they are talking to preschoolers. And his voice just doesn't sound right to me. I know this should be minor, but since the voice over is so important to a movie, I just couldn't watch it. The overall image quality is great, but I found it unteachable.",1315440000,2,397,4.2368421052631575
3703033,1,B001MYIQKO,"I read a couple of the cautionary reviews about the dialogue for this ""video"" and I went ahead reluctantly and ordered this video and I am going to send it back asap. The dialogue is flat out the worst thing I have ever sat through. The speculation is on the level of, ""What if the rabbit ate the carrot before it had a chance to sprout its green leaves?"" and all the while is is said with a sence of utmost importance. The audio track is suspensful at those moments when it posits questions like, ""what if the sun dies? What if a comet hits the earth and we all follow the state of the dinosaurs?"", AND ""dun dun dun dahhhhh.... Quasars, the deadliest things in the universe.... what if we entered them and were energized into smithereens?""
Sorry. If you are expecting science, it is on a 2nd grade level. The graphics are just that. There is no photos from the hubble, this is all computer generated along the lines of star trek. (the tv series, not the movies which were up scale a bit)
To sum this up. I will return it. I found it to be the biggest disappointment to date from amazon, and I probably have orderd hundreds of items from Amazon. This isn't even on the level of so bad it is laughable. There is nothing here but monotomy in my opinion. Of course, that is all these reviews are, and some might find this thing entertaining or even ""spiritual"" in nature. In a way, I hope not. hahaha. National Geographic should take this one off the shelves to avoid all the embarassment in my opinion.",1310688000,9,1500,4.341637010676156
3703034,4,B001MYIQKO,"Thought this was pretty interesting. I don't believe it was ever meant for an educational setting but it is a very interesting, insightful (in plain english) dvd, with awesome narration. I got this and a morgan freeman universe type dvd just because of their narration abilities and they really do draw you in and put you in the movie. really really neat.",1310256000,,355,4.741935483870968
3703035,1,B001MYIQKO,"Clearly made to impress people with visual effects more than to educate and inspire, and I felt for the bait being a fan of other National Geographic series such as ""Ancient Megastructures"" thinking they can't go wrong here. Ultra obnoxious music and sound effects that makes you squirm through the whole duration, same was the narrator Pertwee who seems to try to scare you and at the sametime ramble and drone obnoxiously on and on for 90minutes nonstop. (There is a version with Alec Balwin instead.) Gives me a headache from the space travel effects which happens about every 20-30 seconds and the amount of craps the narrator are spewing out. ""If, may be, perhaps, what if"", these speculations makes up most of the film. If you must see beautiful images of the universe without the science, just use a search engine to get real images. This documentary made of almost entirely CGI which are outdated looking considering the funding available from an entity such as National Geographic. However if you like to experience a bad trip, watch this documentary.

Base on other reviewers recommendation I'll look up The Universe series instead.",1309996800,7,1142,4.947916666666667
3703036,5,B001MYIQKO,"This is a spectacular docu. 12 million Earth's inside the Sun? Did I hear that right? Wow, the things I don't know! This is beautiful - almost too beautiful. I actually got a little dizzy/motion sickness watching this. I'm not sure if it was a visual thing or a reaction to the information Alec Baldwin was conveying. Either way, it was a great thing and I recommend this for all ages.",1308268800,,385,4.436619718309859
3703037,5,B001MYIQKO,"Great documentary about our galaxy and far beyond. Although it isn't thoroughly informational as with BBC's The Planets, it is nonetheless very
awesome to watch. You experience it like a journey indeed, like the title says. This is as close as we can get to experience such a magnificent journey.
It reminded me of the wormhole scene in Contact with Jody Foster.
This one's for both the experts and non-experts.",1308182400,,411,4.885714285714286
3703038,3,B001MYIQKO,"I can't help but feel that I am not able to do this video justice as any words I choose come no where close to the awe inspiring experience it was to watch this video. The video graphics and production quality for this presentation are superb. The video takes you on a journey first from the earth to the Sun stopping at Mercury and Venus along the way, then from there you fly to the outer edge of the solar system stopping at the other planets and some of their moons before leaving the solar system and then our galaxy. You see stars born, stars die, travel through some of the most beautiful bodies in the heavens, and then to the beginning of time as we know it. The grand scale of the universe is incredible.

While the Amazon description of this video list Sean Pertwee as a narrator unfortunately he is nowhere to be found on this version. The USA version is narrated only by Alec Baldwin. I double-checked the audio options and there's only two audio tracks (Stereo and Surround). I personally found Sean Pertwee to be the better of the two narrators. Baldwin does an okay job, but Pertwee speaks as though he's actually experiencing the environments; he speaks as though he is reaching into the soul of these heavenly bodies and voicing their rage, their serenity, their destructiveness, their creativeness, their artistry, and their power.",1303344000,9,1350,4.648535564853557
3703039,4,B001MYIQKO,"I found the ""Journey to the Edge of the Universe"" very instructional and quite interesting.  My only caveat is it tried to cover too much information in only a short time frame.  It did peak my interest in learning more about our universe though and for that I give it a solid 5 stars. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the universe and it is well worth your money and time.  Alec Baldwin has a nice voice and narrates it quite well.",1302998400,,459,4.313953488372093
3703040,5,B001MYIQKO,"This Blu-Ray will give you a new perspective on life.  It is the greatest space documentary I have ever seen.

3703042,2,B001MYIQKO,"This DVD tries to overawe rather than educate. While scientists are over cautious this DVD has gone far too far in the other direction. There is very little attempt (I will not say none) the explain the objects, just to hype them up when no hype is actually required.

Some examples. Just as you pass the asteroid belt on the way out from the Sun, there is talk about looking back in time to the point of creation. A bit premature at this point? Venus is global warming gone wild! We might all be Martians (without any real evidence). Maybe squid are swimming under the ice on one of the planetary moons. Star formation is the birth of a new universe. Just too much speculation, and it becomes difficult to distinguish fact from fancy. In the end the credibility is lost.

I do not want my mind boggled; I want the facts placed into context. For me it just did not work at all. National Geographic are not up to their usual high standards. ""The Universe"" and ""Cosmic Voyage"" are far more entertaining and at the end you will come away with feel for how the universe works as well.",1293840000,27,1080,4.395

I have no idea what the script writers had in mind, or why the script was okayed; it describes cosmic processes in terms applicable to human dramas:  ""Scary,"" Evil,"" ""Wrong,"" Fearsome,"" If a black hole was there, you wouldn't know it until it was too late.""  If attempting to inspire ""shock and awe,"" it is pathetically misguided; the Universe shown on the film is majestic, awe-inspiring, and of a scale that puts human judgments and dramas in stark perspective.

Especialy my father 74 years old and said this documentary just shows you how seriouse human kind takes themself well not even our whole solare system is a speeck of dust in this univers.

3703051,1,B001MYIQKO,"I have 3 major disappointments.

1) Buyer beware: all footages are computer graphics generated CGI's.  Considering this day and age, we have numerous colorful awe inspiring Hubble picture, why didn't they throw in any of the real deal?
2) The entire program has only 1 narrator, Alec Baldwin.  We never see his face nor anyone else's, and his voice is fine, but I rather have a panel of distinguished Cal Tech PhD's verberate their thoughts.
3) This program is monotonously long drawn out, and all information presented is already in numerous other space/science dvd's.  Considering this is a newly released 2009 program, it contained neither new information nor latest findings in the field of astronomy in this decade.

I passed this one off to a collegue, who later passed it off in the trash.

A better buy most similar to this one, but will do a better job at dropping your jaw in awe at the grandeur of our universe is ""The Privileged Planet,"" please read my review there.  Also, other space videos I recommend include: The Elegant Universe (Brian Greene); Origins NOVA (Neil Degrasse); The Universe Seasons 1-4 (blu ray); Creation of the Universe (Timothy Ferris); and A Traveler's Guide to the Planets blu ray (watch the trailer clips on National Geographic website).",1271548800,26,1275,4.929906542056075

The main content narration is subpar when compared to the typical quantity of scientific information and insight provided in any of the BBC's Attenborough nature specials.  The CGI is also unimpressive and the blu-ray is only 1080i and even that might be a stretch.  I much prefered Stargaze HD on blu-ray, even though it lacked narration, for similar subject matter.

Instead, if you're like me and want to actually know what's happening out there and what the current theories of the day are all about, then I recommend The Universe series from the History Channel.  Much better and much more thorough investigations.

Hope that helps someone!

Blu Ray is still new to me but still the picture is awesome. Unlike others similar in genre, it has an interesting, if not quirky plot. Between the imagery and Alec's soothing voice I often put it on for a nap. If I had to rate it for napability, I'd rate it 5 of 5

3703060,4,B001MYIQKO,"I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers that the documentary is visually fantastic, which gets it 4-stars.  However, The script that Alec Baldwin is reading from is extremely tedious.  The facts presented are not terribly informative or thorough.  Writing the script from the perspective of a traveller, which some may like, did not particularly appeal to me.  ""Woah, what's that?"" doesn't really belong in a documentary.  The emphasis placed on an extraterrestrial source for life on earth is annoying and a distraction from the purpose of the documentary.

I agree with the criticisms offered by the last reviewer.

Visually, great.  So-so on being informative.  The narraration may have you pressing 'mute.'",1259539200,14,718,5.396396396396397
3703061,2,B001MYIQKO,"The disc is a collection of near-realistic computer graphics. The first half is solar system planets. The second half focuses on white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, with insufficient attention given to nebulae, globular clusters, and elliptical galaxies (all galaxies shown are either dwarf irregular or grand-design spirals).

The rather pleasant images are well rendered, but the text for the voice-over is worse than nothing. The discussion is juvenile, reaching for fake drama rather than context and information. The danger of getting close to the objects discussed is overdone, and the repeated theme of hesitancy to move on is tedious.

The film over-uses a ""warp drive"" effect to patch together vignettes. That effect is poorly rendered (not scientific enough), and much too long. Showing a good map would have been far better way to show travel. The images are good, but will be better when the voice-over is completely re-written and replaced.

When you arrive at the nearest star to our solar system you are informed that it would take the Space Shuttle over 150,000 years to get here.  You get the idea.

It's probably the best (Resolution) CGI filled disc on Blu-ray

I had fun learning while watching

What I didn't like:

Too much talk about humans coming from Mars (I don't disagree but it was overkill for me)
Felt very anti religious at times (Doesn't bother me too much but it will for others)
Would have liked more footage or facts of the planets visited
The warp speed animation was recycled too much

It should have been a spectacular production in line with most of National Geographic's work but the commentary by Alec Baldwin just completely ruins the production.

I kinda wished they had more 2 show us, I mean; don't know about the rest of you all but I really love space stuff wished more was added 2 this and blue ray makes things a bit better.  I just can't get over just how long it took just 2 leave the galaxy too bad we didn't visit Andromeda.

3703082,3,B001MYIQKO,The computer graphics were outstanding and made the HD images come alive however the disk was hampered by the dumbed down narrative which was directed toward someone with a fourth grade education.

Since nothing in space and time are static, a real voyage from Earth to the edge of the Universe would be nothing like the fantasy existence National Geographic is trying to sell in this video.

I've seen a thousand documentaries on our universe.  Nothing even comes close to this. I have spent many years contemplating our place in the universe both from religious and philosophical standpoints. I can honestly say that this documentary has played a pivotal role in shaking me out of my ""bubble"" on how I view nearly everything. After first seeing it on National Geographic, I spent months thinking about it.  When I look out at the Ocean now I am aware of who I am and where we really are.

When you finish this video, you will walk away from it with an awareness that you never had before, of the unseen astronomically massive universe that we float around on like a spec of dust in the ocean.  The most brilliant and awe inspiring thing about it, is that its all completely true.  This video takes you on a journey through the universe as if you are watching a Sci Fi adventure.  Yet you constantly have to remind yourself that what you're seeing is really out there.  This is all fact.

Someone else aptly described this video in better words than I can:

""it was as if time were standing still. The narrator takes you on an amazing journey from the face of the earth to the edge of the Universe (as we know it) in a stunning visual articulation of the cosmos. I have literally watched this almost everyday since first seeing it on TV. The graphics are top notch and extremely smooth. It feels as though you are right there, soaring thru the galaxies at home and way beyond.

The materials are not presented in a systematic way other than it's a journey from Earth - well at least I can't fault the title.  I will much rather have an overview of the solar system first before delving into individual planets, then repeated the same for the milky way etc.

The narration is boring, repetitive yet at (numerous) times over the top.  I know the universe is peaceful looking from a distance but dangerous and violent upclose, but I do not have to be reminded at every single stop. The melodrama tone and description are oddly out of place, with the writer and Alex Baldwin equally to blame.

For the record I am a star trek fan (btw the latest installment is the best) and I find reading Stephen Hawkings' books enjoyable.  The only thing the DVD did for me is reminding me how much I have forgot.

It was such a wild ride through the cosmos and I enjoyed every second of it. Sadly, I didn't know his name at the time. When I rushed in to buy the BD version, I was surprised by the different narrator.

Visually, it still is a sight to behold with some of the most amazing CG I have seen in a documentary about space. However, the overall experience seems lacking. It is nowhere as good with Baldwin's flat narration. I also wish it was 1080P instead of 1080i seeing how this is a new program with fast moving action. The BD also seems to be region-free as no region is specified on the cover.

I do have one minor gripe and one major gripe though. The minor one is that it doesn't spend enough time on certain things before moving on. There is plenty more they could've said about significant moons of planets, but many aren't even mentioned at all, and it comes off as a crash course of sorts.

The major gripe is the narration. Alec Baldwin does a fine job with the material he's given, the problem is the actual material often comes off as cheesy and pretentious. The big CGI rock I'm looking at isn't an ""orb of wonder"" and the section of space they're showing doesn't ""give me an eerie feeling"" like the exposition suggests. As is fairly common with US documentaries, it's a little too overwrought; BBC's ""The Planets"" did the descriptions far better, without holding my hand through it or telling me how I'm supposed to ""feel awe in gazing at the wonders"" of whatever.

It's worth a purchase and probably multiple viewings, but don't take the narration too seriously. It'd almost be better with your own background music just to watch the visuals, except then you'd miss all the information you actually do learn from watching it.",1240272000,5,1328,4.740259740259741
3703106,4,B001MYIQKO,"This Blu-ray has become one of my favorites. The video is among the sharpest I've seen yet on my 10 foot screen. I would love to see this redone in a 3D version! Except for acted out campfire scenes at the very begining and end of the program, the whole thing is very realistic-looking computer graffics. I doubt anyone could ever come up with something like this with entirely new information, so some new mixed with standard is fine. I gave it only four stars though and here's why: Way too many documentaries simple get overly carried away with unreal sound effects. Traveling by planets brings on the heavy rumbling sounds of thruster engines! Flying by probes, asteroids and even galaxies, you hear  'whushing' sound effects. These sounds are science fiction, not reality and distracts from the feel of the empty void of outer space. With the many audio options video discs provides, maybe some one will take advantage of them and at least give us the option to turn those annoying sounds off? This isn't a compliant, just a request! Still highly recomended.",1239062400,3,1063,4.7771739130434785
3703107,5,B001MYIQKO,"I have rarely seen a more fascinating, breathtaking production. I was completely mesmerized. National Geographic did an outstanding job putting this production together. The vastness and beauty of the universe truly inspires awe and in my opinion, demonstates evidence of intelligent design. I am grateful to National Geographic for consistently providing first rate programming that educates, entertains and gives me a most welcome alternative to the mindless drivel shown on so many TV shows. I am delighted that ""Journey To The Edge of The Universe"" will be available next month (March '09) and I am pre-ordering it right now! I can hardly wait to watch it again (and again). Thank you, National Geographic!",1234828800,2,710,5.292035398230088
3703108,5,B001MYIQKO,"This program will be marvelous when it can be watched uninterrupted by commercials. It is almost a meditation on the awesome splendor out there. Awesome is a word that has lost much of its value these days but this program invokes awe. I can't wait to put the headphones on and disappear into the interstellar spaces. After watching it I found it a real challenge to balance the depressing things going on down here with the billion year beauty out there. Splendid graphics, excellent narration, it weaves a spell. Thank you National Geographic I have waited years for a program like this. This is what computer graphics were made for.",1231027200,124,635,4.781818181818182
3703109,5,B001MYIQKO,I watched this last night and it's amazing!  The best program I've ever seen on the universe.  Alec Baldwin is fantastic as the narrator and really draws you in.  The pictures are amazing and give you such a feeling of being so small compared to all that is out there.  I can't wait to purchase this educational program for my family!,1229040000,5,334,4.426229508196721

One of the best programs on our known Universe I have ever seen, and I've seen them all. Alec Baldwin voiceover was a nice touch, but the visuals are simply amazing, and will give you goosebumps!",1228780800,,295,4.285714285714286

8322506,3,B001MYIQKO,"This was a good, one of a kind documentary movie touring to the edge of the Universe. The graphics and visuals were high quality, though a bit cheesy especially for how bright the milky way looked from our Solar System. The planets are crisp and clear and the exoplanets are good impressions of what they might look like up close. It has stunning visuals and a story which teaches you whether we're alone or not. It also teaches us that we live in the best known spot. The soundtrack especially is amazing, it reminded me of Avatar, and this and that were made in almost the same date, so I see the connection. I even get the genre. And speaking of soundtracks, when I saw this, I wondered if James Horner (who died in a plane crash in 2015) composed this score, but I found that disputed. Alpha Centauri was also shown in this, but there could've been a potential to have Polyphemus & Pandora on it(though unfortunately this was made a tad too early). And now that planets like Kepler's planets and Proxima Centauri b were discovered, this show needs a major update, plus the MESSENGER spacecraft and Cassini are over with, so... They added a bunch of events to entertain us and make it remarkable. The depth of this show makes us wonder how far can we look and the graphics make us think how could they make such a thing like that. Of course the black holes could use improvement, now that Interstellar showed us what a black hole really looks like up close. We got to see impressions of what the big bang theory was like, though I've seen many different impressions. Alec Baldwin was the perfect narrator for this movie, he does the U.S. version (this), whereas Sean Pertwee does the U.K. version (which I'm not from). If there were an updated version at 60 or 120 FPS, then it would be a top notch masterpiece and would be a classic movie. It gave us new perspectives of our known universe and depths that even telescopes could not achieve. It gives us ideas about our future. One day, we will all die, the world will end, and we'll be in our Sun's menu. But like Alec Baldwin said, we should rejoice and realize how important our matter is in the universe and how it's within us.",1520812800,,2184,4.448877805486284
