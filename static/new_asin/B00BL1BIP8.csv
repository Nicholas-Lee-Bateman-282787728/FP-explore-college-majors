5637732,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Four stars might be a stretch, but there were enough memorable characters and magical moments to just barely save the day. Then again it's pretty sad when the two best characters are a CGI china doll and a talking monkey in a suit. I loved both of them.

James Franco as Oz shines and fails from scene to scene. Mila Kunis as one of the three witches can't seem to shake her That 70's Show/Family Guy voice and it get really annoying, especially towards the end. The other two witches played by Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz thankfully fare much better.

The IMAX 3-D is done really well and is worth the extra money, though the film is way too CGI heavy. Beautiful, but hollow. I did like how the first 20 minutes was in 1:33:1 screen ratio and black and white. It gave the opening the right feel.

Danny Elfman usually works his musical magic with Tim Burton and often sounds like a broken record, but his Oz score fits the tone and visuals. Some of the pieces are quite beautiful.

As pure entertainment, I had a good time. Miles from the 1939 classic, but a trip to Oz is worth your time.

5637733,4,B00BL1BIP8,"This afternoon I went to see ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Hey---a new theatrical interpretation of Oz, how could I possibly resist?

I've noted previously that the 1939 Oz film had a tremendous impact on me as a child, and influenced me throughout my life. (For instance---I daresay the influence of the film is one of the reasons I've always been partial to the poppy flower. And in fact at this very moment I'm working on a stained glass lampshade featuring a poppy design---over four decades after I first saw this film.)

How does this new trip through Oz compare? Well, it doesn't---but I hardly expected it to be in the same league as the iconic 74-year-old film. However, while flawed I thought in the end it proves to be an entertaining entry on the list of Oz adaptations---not as good as some of the others, but far better than many of the lesser offerings.

I am not well acquainted with James Franco's body of work, so I had no expectations going in on how he would play the role. I'm afraid my primary impression of this actor was a negative one, based almost entirely on his bizarre and disastrous turn in hosting the Oscars a couple of years ago. (If he wasn't drunk or high on that job---then what on earth was he thinking?) But---I think he does a decent job here with the character. Oh, perhaps he could have used a bit more bluster and bravado---a dash of Robert Preston's Professor Hill from ""The Music Man."" But overall, his interpretation worked for me.

Unfortunately, one of the other primary casting choices was disastrous. Mila Kunis didn't work AT ALL for me as the Wicked Witch of the West; I just didn't buy it. Her transformation to this evil creature was underdeveloped, though this was primarily due to problems with the script, which shortchanged both the set-up and payoff. But I didn't find her voice, or physical appearance, or general demeanor convincing in the least. And this is such an iconic character, that the weak link is problematic for the film overall.

The script was okay but rather by-the-numbers; I thought the story dragged a bit in the central portion (the film clocks in at around 130 minutes), though things livened up considerably during the final half-hour as the battles between the witches got underway. I think the main problem with the film is that it's lovely to look at, and fairly imaginative, but it has no genuine heart or soul. The audience isn't really given any character to root for, to identify with, and as a result our emotional involvement and attachment to what is happening on-screen is muted at best.

I'm sorry to say that I didn't find the scoring to be particularly memorable, which is a shame because first-rate orchestrations could have greatly enhanced the viewing experience. And it was a real shame that no elements directly related to the 1939 film were included in this production. (Due to copyright restrictions, only Baum's original book series---now in public domain---were used for inspiration.) For instance, the presence of the ruby slippers could have provided some key plot points---I've already thought of interesting ways they could have been incorporated into the story. And frankly, I just don't see why the producers of this film didn't secure the rights to use some of the elements from the classic film, because such a thing has been done before in previous Oz adaptations. It makes no sense whatsoever to me.

All that said, I did enjoy the film---don't regret going to see it---and found it a pleasant diversion overall. It very well may be one I'll buy when the blu-ray becomes available. I don't think it will leave any lasting or particularly memorable impression in today's pop culture, but it's a respectable enough entry to the world of Oz. I'm hoping that this film performs well, because if it does turn a profit it will make the possibility of further Oz projects that much more likely. (Though it does have a job cut out for it---it will probably have to make over 400 million (USD) world-wide before it breaks even. I'm going to follow the box office most carefully and see how it does.)

Oh, an addendum---for those who are curious, I would say this film is moderately family-friendly. Now, I wouldn't take toddlers to see it or anything---too scary for the very young---but it was much less intense than I had been anticipating. I suppose I had been thinking that it would have a bit more ""mature"" content. In fact, this film is fairly light in comparison to 1985's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Oz/dp/B0000DZ3EN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Oz</a>, which has a much darker, more adult tone. Now, while that film was a failure at the box office, it is one of which I am very fond, and which does have a cult following to this day. If ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" puts you in an Ozian sort of mood, by all means don't forget to check out ""Return to Oz"" in turn!",1362787200,3,4939,4.809187279151944
5637734,4,B00BL1BIP8,"In ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" a prequel to the 1939 classic, Sam Raimi presents us with a visually striking wonder that boasts a talented cast and magic-filled story. The basis synopsis involves a traveling magician and confidence man named Oscar Diggs (nicknamed Oz and played by James Franco) who dreams of doing more than entertaining small audiences in small towns. His dreams include not only being a ""good man"", but a ""great one."" During a violent storm in Kansas in 1905, the magician is magically transported to the magical land of Oz, a realm in which his arrival indicates he's part of a grand prophecy that foretells his slaying of the Wicked Witch.

There's no doubt that Raimi is a master of the visual arts, as is seen on display here. The vibrant colors and sweeping, majestic landscapes are beautiful and a real treat to look at. Not to mention the incredible opening sequence that really set the visual tone for the rest of the film. I didn't see ""Oz"" 3D but I've heard from others the movie makes great use of the technology.

Unfortunately, in spite of the terrific art direction and special effects, there's something lacking in the story Raimi was trying to tell. Perhaps that's due to flaws in the script but there's definite inconsistencies in the tone and a couple gag-out-loud lines of dialogue that take away from the sense of wonderment in the film. At times the movie is a suspense-filled mystery, shrouded by dark overtones and shadowy characters that, frankly, I would be a little nervous to bring a little one to. At others, it's a fun-loving family film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Mix in a few overly long dialogue scenes and you get a very uneven story that doesn't quite know where to go.

On the positive side, while there may be problems with the overall story, there's nothing wrong with the cast. Say what you will about James Franco but the actor knows how succeed with what he's given; he smiles and charms in his role as the title magician and, in my opinion, was a great casting choice. Equally enjoyable are the witches that Oz encounters, namely Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams). Weisz in particular seems to enjoy her evil role and Williams is regal as ever as the good witch. The two standout members of the cast for me, however, belong to Zach Braff, who plays Oz's assistant in the prologue, and later on voices the flying monkey Finley, and Joey King who voices the delicate yet feisty China Girl. Both of these characters have some of the most memorable lines and interject a lot of the humor contained in the film. As a treat, there's also a cameo from Bruce Campbell that will make fans smile.

Though there's flaws in the overall story, this film is worth seeing for the sheer sense of wonder and awe. The talented cast and wonderful special effects make up for a lot of the misgivings of the movie, and make for an experience that fans of the original Oz film, as well as youngsters that have no idea who Dorothy even is, will enjoy.",1362787200,3,3045,4.6437847866419295
5637735,3,B00BL1BIP8,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a charming prequel to the 1939 classic ""The Wizard of Oz.""  It shares a number of themes and visuals with the older movie, including the nicely done black and white introduction that transitions into the stunningly colorful Land of Oz.

The story beings in 1905 Kansas with a small-time circus magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco), Oz for short.  Oz is a con man, a charlatan, and a cad, but he might also be a man who wants to be better.  A balloon ride into a tornado dumps Oz in the Land of Oz.  There, he meets the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis), and learns that he is the fulfillment of a prophesy that a wizard would come from the skies to save the Land of Oz from an evil witch.

Oz travels to the Emerald City, where he meets Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and is bribed into going after a third witch, the allegedly evil Glinda.  Along the way, he picks up as traveling companions the more or less helpful flying monkey Finley and a little girl made of china.  He will confront Glinda (Michelle Williams), only to find that he has been misled about the true state of affairs in Oz.  A reluctant Oz will be asked to help set things right.  Oz might not be the wizard they expected, but he might be the wizard they need.  The end is frightful and suspenseful, as Oz pits his illusions and misdirection against the real magic of the witches...

James Franco does a nice job as a guy who allows himself to be talked into doing the right thing.  Michelle Williams does an equally nice job as the witch who sees Oz as he is, yet believes in the person he could become.  Recommended.",1362787200,,1628,4.365448504983389
5637736,3,B00BL1BIP8,"It is hard to believe, with all the technology and resources that we have in the movie industry these days, that a movie released in 1939 still reigns supreme over others of the same vein or any that try to duplicate, but it is true. ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" was looking to change that. Disney originally had the rights to ""The Wizard of Oz"" but sold them to Samuel Goldwyn, who in turn sold it to Louis B. Mayer, who created the original film. Now, it has run full circle and Disney brings us ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"", a prequel that explains the origin of the man who became Oz.

Oscar Diggs, played by James Franco, is a circus magician in early 20th century Kansas. He's a shallow man. He's an arrogant man. He's a womanizer (they took a few liberties there). So when his time in the circus comes to an abrupt halt and his hot air balloon finds the heart of a Kansas tornado, he finds Oz, just the same way that Dorothy did. We go from black and white to vivid, 3D animation color. We've come a long way since 3-strip Technicolor.

The beauty and 3D of the entire film are exceptional. The best part of the film was the realization of the Land of Oz like we didn't get in the original. Sure, they traveled the yellow brick road for part of the film, but we also get to see places inside the Emerald City that we could only imagine before. We get to see off the beaten path places in the land of Oz. We get to meet a little China doll girl who was the only survivor of a China doll city that was destroyed by the witch's monkeys. The imagery of the film is top notch. The effects that bring the witches to life and Oscar's friends are none short of brilliant.

Bottom line though, if you're slapping 5-stars on this movie, your standards are way too low. We deserve better as paying customers. As I've seen a lot in recent months and years, the script doesn't match the visuals. The script is sluggish and dull, including the one pathetic attempt at tapping into the musical that the original was. ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" doesn't even come close to achieving the magic of the first. The movie is unrealized and hastily thrown together, a money making venture.

The writers and creators took a strange course that to me, proved very costly. Oscar a.k.a. Oz, is a ladies man. He woos nearly every woman he meets. The three women, Theodora,Evanora and Glenda are all smitten with him. Consequently, there's a lot of kissing. Not only is it hard to believe James Franco to be this person, it plays out like a television soap opera, cheapening and distracting the audience from what they truly came to see.

""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" is a so-so way to escape for a few hours. I especially like the characters that Oz meets along the way; the China Girl and Finley the flying bellhop monkey. Yet, too much time was wasted building up emotional relationships with three different women and that left the scenes with the witches doing their nasty evil, in the sparse category. You'd think with something like this, Hollywood would have taken more time to make sure it wasn't just a visual treat and would have left sexual attraction on the cutting room floor.",1362787200,3,3170,4.439862542955327

5637738,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Making a prequel for such an iconic fantasy and beloved film as the Wizard of Oz at first glance seems like just more grist for the Hollywood mill, but said assumption couldn't be farther from the truth.

Oz the Great and Powerful (aka Oscar Diggs) is a magician in a small, traveling circus who is good at fooling an audience, most of the time, and sweet-talking the local ladies.  The latter becomes a source of trouble as an angry boyfriend, who just happens to be the circus strong man, prompts Oscar's hasty departure from the troupe via a hot-air balloon and bad luck turns worse when it flies right into the path of a tornado.  By some twist of fate, or divine intervention, Oscar finds himself not only alive but in a strange and beautiful land where magic is more than sleight of hand and its local residents, including three lovely witches, mistake him for a heroic wizard and either a potential savior or threat, depending on the point of view.  Many people found in a similar situation would probably stumble around in denial and disbelief but Oscar is a performer of the first order and subsequently cons his way through just about every fantastic or difficult situation thrust upon him all the while struggling to suppress the true hero buried deep within.

James Franco in the lead role brings his usual intensity with a hint of gravitas, a healthy dose of light-heartedness and a smile that lights up the screen; he's utterly convincing and captivating as both con-artist and hero and I believe this role was perfect for him.  I thought the film seemed well-cast all around but let me just comment on another dual role I particulary enjoyed; that of Theodora/ Wicked Witch of the West (as portrayed by Mila Kunis) because this part was just so pivotal to the story and a remarkable performance really helped to buoy what at times edged towards a one man show.  Cinematically, the land of Oz is a feast for the eyes and even more striking when set against the B&W opening (used to full advantage as with the original), the creature FX were stunningly perfect including the terrifying flying baboons as well as Oz's newfound traveling friend Finley the flying monkey, the wizard duel towards the end was brief but visually exciting, the finale was so creative and it demonstrates the solid writing behind this film and I just gotta admit that little China Girl completely stole my heart.

I have no doubt that many professional critics will write this one off as light fare but for me it's films like Oz the Great and Powerful combined with exceptional actors like Franco and innovative and distinctive directors like Sam Raimi that help to restore my faith in the modern, American film industry.  In the end this movie just made me happy, I left the theater with a huge smile on my face... I really can't recommend it enough for people of all ages that enjoy a good fantasy-adventure or just great cinema.  :o)",1362700800,194,2925,4.684210526315789
5637739,4,B00BL1BIP8,"L. Frank Baums Oz stories will make a wonderful series of films. Theres so much adventure and depth in them. MGMs 1939 movie musical, THE WIZARD OF OZ was a hit at the time of its release and is a true classic piece of cinema. The public loves it to this day and the world of Oz has remained at the forefront of popular culture (just take a look at the success of the Broadway show WICKED, for example). However, the 1939 movie has such a strong hold on popular conscience that it makes it incredibly difficult to begin a new series by starting with Baums first book, THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ. Disney tried to circumvent this issue by making a sequel film to the book in the 1980s with RETURN TO OZ. Though that film has gained a cult following and respect, it was initially a box office failure that was mostly panned by critics. Twenty years later, Disney is trying to circumvent MGMs stronghold on the Oz series by returning to Oz again. However, this time its in the form of a prequel to Baums first book, entitled OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL.

The story begins in 1905 Kansas with a traveling con man magician with Baums Bros. Circus Co. named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) who performs under the moniker Oz the Great and Powerful (his real name is actually so long that most people just call him Oz for short anyway). Oscar spends his time seducing young women and duping audiences into believing hes something that he is not. However, despite his wily nature, there is goodness in him, as witnessed when hes unable to grant a young girls wish to heal her legs. Also, despite being a conman, Oscar yearns to do something great and change the world like his hero, Thomas Edison.

Its not too long before Oscar is swept away in a Kansas funnel cloud and transported to the magical land of Oz. Upon his arrival he is greeted by a beautiful woman named Theodora (Mila Kunis). She believes he is the great wizard mentioned in a prophecy who has arrived to set Oz free from the clutches of The Wicked Witch. Theodora is also a witch, but one that is good. She escorts Oscar to The Emerald City to meet with her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who is the steward of the city after the death of the King by hands of the Wicked Witch. Oscar soon gets thrown into the politically trouble in Oz. He befriends a small flying monkey name Finley (Zach Braff), heals a tiny China Girl (Joey King), and meets yet another witch named Glinda (Michelle Williams). Everyone in Oz believes Oscar to be The Wizard spoken of in prophecy and that he will overthrow the rule of the Wicked Witch. Everyone, but Oscar, that is.

The cinematography of the film is well done and the last action sequences of the piece (when Oz reveals his true form) are particular spectacular. The acting is done well, particularly by Mila Kunis and Zach Braff. The movie also does a great job of beginning a new story, yet nodding its head to the MGM 1939 movie (e.g. look in the background for horses of different colors and the Munchkins like to sing).

The movie does have a few flaws. The biggest is that James Franco just doesnt seem right for the part of Oz. Hes got the look of a con man about him, but he never has the feel of one. Whenever he cons someone, it just feels like a little kid dressed up in adult clothes who has no idea what hes doing and is just playing make believe. I realize thats part of the intent of the story. However, the character of Oz should be more forceful and Franco just doesnt give Oz the gravitas that he needs. Women will still like him because hes good looking and charming, but the emotional depth of the character just isn't there.

Also, there middle section of the film is rather uneven. The opening sequences and the finale fit together perfectly. However, the middle section of the movie doesnt transition very well from one moment to the next and the quick changing of sequences is sure not to sit well with some people (Why was that middle section so long, is sure to be heard).

Overall, I was pleased with OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL. As a fan of the Baums stories, the movie is about what I expected. Its not necessarily a great movie, but it is a good one and makes a good setup for some wonderful Oz stories yet to come.",1362700800,,4230,4.389030612244898
5637740,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Directed by Sam Raimi (Spider-Man, The Evil Dead), Oz: the Great and Powerful stars James Franco as Oscar Diggs (Oz), a mediocre circus magician that is swept up in a Kansas tornado and dropped in the Land of Oz.  After his arrival in Oz, Oscar is told by three different witches that hes the prophesized wizard thats meant to restore order to the Land of Oz and defeat The Wicked Witch of the West (Mila Kunis) and her evil sister, The Wicked Witch of the East (Rachel Weisz).  With the help of the Good Witch, Glinda (Michelle Williams), Oz must find a way to restore order and defeat the evil witches before they enslave the good people of Oz.  Zach Braff and Joey King lend their voices for the film, while Tony Cox and Bill Cobbs also serve in supporting roles.

Despite the fact this film relies too much on CGI (and we will get to that), not everything is bad about this new re-imagination of Oz.  In fact, its quite the enjoyable film  starting with the cast.  Now, hes no Judy Garland, but James Franco is a surprisingly good fit for the role of Oscar Diggs (The Wizard), with his sly charm and ulterior motives.  This is a character that hasn't found his way yet, but hes clearly searching to be something more than he is  a relatable trait for many of us.  As far as the rest of the cast goes, Michelle Williams has always done a tremendous job of playing the girl next door, so she fits in perfectly as the innocent, good witch.  On the other hand, both Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis made for two incredibly lackluster witches.  Kunis does her best Wicked Witch of the West impression, but falls so far short of the mark that you cant help but hope shes recast in the event of a sequel (which already has a green light, if the box office numbers are promising).

Casting aside, the visual effects were just downright disappointing and overused.  The colors were beautiful, but they just didn't flow properly with this fairy tale.  Perhaps, thats just the classic Wizard of Oz holding me back.  Yes, this film was a perfect candidate for 3D, with all of its wild flowers and flying monkeys, but having an abundance of CGI ALWAYS takes away from the story  not to mention its uncomfortable to see an actor (Franco) trying to imagine tiny CGI water fairies biting your leg.  Dont feel bad Mr. Franco, this is one of the biggest problems in film today.  In any event, the films beginning (20 minutes or so) was the most notable due to the throwback black and white 4:3 aspect ratio.  For a few minutes there, it actually felt like Kansas in 1905.

Even though this film is entertaining, the film itself currently stands for everything wrong in the land of movies.  By no means is this film an outstanding achievement of any kind, but it does manage to throw in a few references to the classic film.  Unfortunately, the film serves only one purpose:  to feed the money-hungry Hollywood beast by using the good name of The Wizard of Oz.  If nothing else, perhaps watching Oz: the Great and Powerful will inspire a new generation to watch one of the greatest films of all-time, the 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz.

5637741,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Set in Kansas in 1905, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" introduces Oscar Diggs (James Franco), also known as Oz, a traveling magician with Baum Bros Circus. Oscar is also a professional con artist, but doesn't give nearly enough credit to his loyal assistant Frank (Zach Braff). Oscar has always dreamt of being a great man, but his lack of ethics and morality and extremely greedy intentions have always held him back. He is accidentally thrown into the Land of Oz where he meets Theodora (Mila Kunis), her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), their rival Glinda (Michelle Williams), a living China Girl (Joey King), and a talking flying monkey in a bell hop suit named Finley (Zach Braff). The prophecy has foretold that a wizard who shares the name of the land will come to save everyone from the clutches of The Wicked Witch. Even though everyone in Oz believes him to be that wizard Oscar can't find the courage to tell everyone the truth.

""The Wizard of Oz"" is in dire need of a revisit. It was something that was seen at a very young age. Not much is remembered other than having a fear of flying monkeys and trying to get a glimpse of that urban myth of one of the munchkins hanging themselves on set and the sequence supposedly making it into the final print of the film. Judging ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as a stand-alone film was the only option since it had been so long.

You can go ahead and welcome Danny Elfman back to a Sam Raimi film. This is Elfman's first collaboration with Raimi in nearly nine years and it's Elfman's score that helps bring that circus theme to life. The opening credits are particularly eye-catching and immediately establish that carnival-like atmosphere. The fantasy adventure begins in black and white and is presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen). It opens with the Baum Bros traveling circus and you witness some of the tricks Oscar has up his sleeve. The tornado sequence is done really well as the debris flying around makes full use of the 3D effect and the organ that passes by is a little unsettling in a good way. Once Oscar makes it to Oz, the film transitions to color and the aspect ratio changes to 2.35:1 (widescreen). The moments when Oscar is witnessing the colorful and wondrous Oz for the first time may be the highlight of the film. Personally speaking, those particular moments are really influential; someone being taken out of their element and placed in a strange new world is just amazing and reminiscent of ""Alice in Wonderland"" in a way.

The film hits its peak once Oscar arrives in Oz. Oscar meets Theodora (Kunis) and saves Finley (Braff) who becomes Oscar's life servant because of it. After meeting Evanora (Weisz), Oscar sets out to the Dark Forest to break the staff of The Wicked Witch and become king. They meet a little China Girl (King) who decides to tag along after Oscar fixes her broken legs. Finley is the best character of the film. He's hilarious nearly every time he opens his mouth. The Dark Forest is also really creepy and the flying baboons are even more terrifying than their relatives.

Everything is progressing smoothly until Glinda (Williams) is introduced. Just because she's The Good Witch doesn't mean she has to be so lame and boring. All she really does is make fog and bubbles. The film suddenly takes a dive into really cheesy territory at this point, too. The special effects seem a bit too overzealous at times as witches probably shouldn't fly around and shoot fireballs or electricity from their hands as often as they do. Mila Kunis is kind of awkward as The Wicked Witch. She's believable as Theodora, but once she transforms it almost seems like she's trying too hard. Her constant squawking and bizarre and rigid hand movements make her seem more like a giant parrot than anything else. Rachel Weisz is mostly satisfying as Evanora until she starts shouting at everyone near the end of the film. Then her voice suddenly starts cracking more often than the Squeaky Voiced Teenager on ""The Simpsons.""

If you're planning on seeing this in theaters, the 3D is utilized quite well and used rather frequently so it's worth the money. Hats are thrown, a strong man bursts through a door, the debris in the tornado, snow, hummingbirds, water fairies, gold coins, and spears all jump out at you. It's certainly the best use of 3D so far this year, but it doesn't exactly have much competition just yet.

""Oz the Great and Powerful"" does stumble about halfway through and never really recovers from its trip into incredibly campy territory. Funny, charming, and imaginative, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a film that lingers on the cusp of greatness but has to settle for being nothing more than acceptable.",1362700800,5,4712,4.712378640776699

It's a little harder for a movie to do the 3D thing in 2:40:1 aspect ratio but they pulled it off perfectly especially the way they opened the movie. The movie starts with a small screen in black and white(Still 3D tho) and after maybe 15 minutes, the main character lands in a strange, outstandingly beautiful and colorful land and the screen slowly expands to the edges of the TV. This movie has great 3D depth thruout and many ""Gotcha"" moments where stuff leaves the screen and comes right out at ya.

5637917,3,B00BL1BIP8,I was one of those who thought this was going to be a out right remake of The Wizard Of Oz.  It's similar but different.  And it is a good movie on it's own.  But it will still be compared to The Wizard.  It starts off in black and white then goes into color when he is wisked over the rainbow.  But the circumstances are different.  Mila Kunis nails it as the young witch.  And is stunning.  And I was never that big of a fan of Michelle Williams but she is just as good also.  And Rachel Weisz is the true villain as she betray's Mila and then you end up rooting against both of them.  This will probably not be a classic.  But like Johnny Depp's Alice In Wonderland.  With all the color's and the combination of special effects.  Animation and acting.  It turns out to be a pretty good trip.,1492473600,,794,4.104575163398692

5637924,4,B00BL1BIP8,"James Franco is decidedly not my favorite actor: Too often his performances seem wooden to me.
That said, I thought he did well in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as a shady, second-rate carnival magician who suddenly finds himself in a fantastical situation. A little over-the-top when the situation calls for it, he also shows surprising depth in some scenes.
The movie itself was a curious blend of animation, CGI, and live-action performances. I'm a little conflicted about how that worked because some of the scenes seemed a little overwrought to me. Not terrible, you understand; it just seemed that the production team was trying too hard to ""make a classic"" in the Disney tradition instead of just telling the story.
The actors - Franco included - were first rate.in this film. There are some critics who have been less than delighted with the job Mila Kunis did after she transforms from a beautiful - if naive - young witch into the wicked sister but I thought she did very well in a challenging role.
Likewise, some people have criticized the screenplay because they have - wrongfully, in my opinion - tried to compare this story with the 1939 ""Wizard of Oz."" L. Frank Baum wrote an entire series of books about the wonderful land of Oz and they each tell a different - if related - story. Because of that, I believe it's unfair to compare one with the other.
In summary: A very nice film with some very good performances by the cast and - if a trifle long - an enjoyable viewing experience.",1491350400,3,1498,4.635338345864661

She did great as Theodora but when she became the Wicked Witch of the West, I couldn't help but feel like she wasn't the best for that role. I know it has to be the same person because she turns into her, but her portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West really lacked for me.

5638076,2,B00BL1BIP8,"Let's just say, as far as ""Oz"" sequels/prequels go, this one is the worst. Compared to a cult classic like ""Return to Oz,"" this movie is some terrible Hollywood sauce. And James Franco as the wizard had to be the worst idea anyone ever had. It's as if people in Hollywood think: ""He's great in those stoner movies with Seth Rogan... how about casting him in the lead role of a prequel to one of the greatest films ever made?"" Same goes for the other actors and actresses, including Mila Kunis. It's just a cast of actors that shouldn't be in a movie like this, but somehow are... because, well... it's Hollywood in the 2010s...",1479081600,2,627,4.460869565217391

5638078,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I loved this movie, from the beautiful stars to the gorgeous visuals, there's so much to love in this package. No, I don't feel the movie is a perfect match for the original, but considering the amount of time separating this movie with the first Wizard of Oz film, they've done a great job in giving you that same sense of Oz and it's strange environments.

I was really impressed with the shift in focus from Dorothy to the Wizard himself. Having grown up with the original movie, and only seeing it once a year or so when it came on public television, the Wizard of Oz was more of an event than it was a simple movie. It was in the same category of movies as Frosty the Snowman or Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer.

It's for this reason that I really enjoyed this movie. It was able to remind me of those years long ago spent in front of a small black and white television, yet impress me with the visuals coming from a 4K 3D TV.  Trust me, having experienced that amount of change really makes a huge impression on the viewer!  It's hard to explain it to someone that's never seen a black and white television, so I don't think I'll try. Just know, if your lucky enough to have only been around long enough to see Television on large 16x9 sets, your going to be a bit confused to just how impressive the visuals are in this movie.  It's only we older folk that remember what television was like so long ago.

I was a child of the seventies, and my television at the time was likely less than 20 inches, I'd venture closer to 13, so owning the new sets with 55+ inches of brilliant color and crystal clear images is breathtaking!  When you add in 3D, well, your in another world altogether!  This is that type of movie.  The story doesn't have to be Shakespearean, the visuals alone will keep you glued to the set, but thankfully, there is some good story in there.

Now, it's not all roses and butterflies. Personally, I feel James Franco didn't spend enough time trying to make the role feel authentic, spending far too much time playing around. Perhaps that was the intention, but I just felt that he went a tad overboard with certain aspects of his character. He was a bit too cruel to the poor monkey that saved him from his nightmare, and to see that flip to just how caring he was to his porcelain friend was a bit strange, but of course, when looking back at the original movie, the wizard was a bit strange there as well, so perhaps it's all simply in my own head.

I'll admit up front, i can't judge Mila Kunis fairly as she's so breathtakingly beautiful that she can do no wrong for me, so I won't even try:)  Rachael Weisz was great throughout, making me feel she genuinely cared about her role in the movie, so those two are cast perfectly for my taste in films.

If you liked the original film and always wanted to see more, but from a different perspective, give this movie a shot, you may come away surprised at what you find.",1478736000,7,2942,4.307971014492754
5638079,3,B00BL1BIP8,"There are two reasons to watch this movie: James Franco and the scenery. Otherwise, it resembles Spiderman 3 in a lot of ways: an excess of hero-worship and cheesy dialogue, with some occasional clever moments. One wonders, in both this movie and Spiderman 3, if people ever help themselves.

James Franco is great in this movie. He even makes this movie better than it actually is. The witches are somewhat diminished from what they were in the original Oz books. Glinda seems more helpless than the powerful, all-benevolent Glinda of the books and the 1939 movie. The Wicked Witch of the West, we are to believe, became what she was only out of an unrequited love for James Franco. Only Evanora, the future Wicked Witch of the East, is kind of cool. She is the main villain, and the prime mover of the story.",1478563200,,810,4.625
5638080,5,B00BL1BIP8,We were both nervous about this initially but wow!. The visuals are amazing. The sound is great and the 3d is a lot of fun too. The story works as filler and keeps a lot of the spirit of the original.,1478217600,2,200,3.902439024390244

Combine this with ""Wicked"" and you are good to go! I'm not a big James Franco fan, I think that lots of times he is unnecessarily goofy, but I actually liked the way he played his role in ""Oz"". If you haven't seen this movie in the theaters or grabbed it out of Redbox, it is definitely worth a buy at a decent price. I don't think you are missing too much by not buying the Blu-ray, as the DVD version will more than suffice.",1478044800,,552,4.027272727272727

Decided to buy this as a birthday gift to myself to watch again. I have watched several 3D movies at home, on REGULAR dvd players. But here I am, 3 weeks later and $60 poorer, and still have yet to see the movie. It will not play on the Xbox, stating no compatibility. I bought a specific 3D DVD player, and it is still stating non compatible. It should not be this difficult to watch a movie. I am disappointed with the Disney company that despite the fact that the technology is available to watch a 3D movie on a standard player, they chose to make this format so that only a select few that have every bell and whistle imaginable can enjoy it as well. Shame, Disney. I will think before I purchase a movie from you again. Your company, as well known and traditional as you are, should be there for the masses, not for $.",1475712000,,995,4.1875

James Franco may not have been the best choice for OZ, but he tries. As does Mila Kunis as Theodora. Michelle Williams is goodness personified as Glinda, but Rachel Weisz looks like she's having the best time playing the conniving Evanora. The mostly CGI Land of OZ is lush & oversaturated, the B/W opening sequence is a tip of the hat to the original film, and the score by Danny Elfman is memorable.

5638480,3,B00BL1BIP8,"So, I suppose you'll want me to start with the bad news first...

I can tell you right up front, as you begin reading this review, I am not
going to have many good things to say about the film, OZ THE GREAT
AND POWERFUL.  I think anytime a studio attempts to revisit a tremendously
popular classic like The Wizard Of Oz, it's only asking for trouble because
expectations generally run high from fans that hold the original so near and
dear to their hearts.

This was a problem for me when the studio first attempted to revisit the
classic with its 1985 film, Return To Oz, which felt more creepy and
disturbing than enchanting.  I am certain that the film absolutely worked
for audiences who were in the mood for an alternate take on the Oz universe,
and particularly those who had read the original L. Frank Baum books and
were more familiar with its characters.  For me, Return To Oz was a horrid
80s film that I believe Disney did everything it could (at the time) to disassociate
itself from.

I suppose enough time had passed that the studio felt it was safe enough to
revisit this sacred property once again.  If expectations again ran high that this
would be a tremendous comeback for OZ, it was only because of all the
pre-release hype Disney put into advance trailers that were shown months
ahead of release in theaters and on television.  I must admit, I was duped into
thinking that OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL was going to be something
absolutely amazing --- particularly for its promising special effects work.

Alas, once again Disney has proven that when it comes to OZ, you just
can't go back home again.

Let's begin with the most obvious problem of this film....it's so insanely miscast.
James Franco is the absolute kiss of death in this movie.  I understand that he
was not director Sam Raimi's first, nor second choice to play the lead.  Robert Downey
Jr. eventually dropped out of negotiations to star, and Johnny Depp was working
on another film.  If you thought watching Franco host the Academy Awards was
awkward, try sitting through 130 minutes of his swarmy performance.  In fact, it
can be extremely difficult sitting through the movie's dreary 20 minute opening alone,
which pretty much sets the pacing for rest of the film.

But Franco is not the only bad casting choice here as Mila Kunis completely drains
the film's of its color with her performance that goes from monotone to completely
laughable once she makes her Incredible Hulk transformation.  While I found
myself entranced by the gorgeous backgrounds and special effects that were
created for this revisit to OZ, it was apparent that most everyone within it was looking
at green screens and trying their best to imagine what we, the audience were
actually seeing.  This was obviously a group of actors that had difficulty using their
imagination and as thus, their reactions and dialogue delivery, are completely
unbelievable to the viewer.

I could go on and about how much I really disliked this film.  However, I do realize
that there are many HTF members that actually enjoyed OZ THE GREAT AND
POWERFUL, so I am going to turn and concentrate my efforts on talking about what
a phenomenal Blu-ray presentation lies in store for them....

There have been so many times that I have praised a particular Blu-ray transfer as
one of the very best I have ever seen.  Well, as far as new releases are concerned,
OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL is most definitely the most breathtaking visual
experience I have ever enjoyed on this format.  You'll have to wait about 20 minutes
to see all the splendor, as the film opens in a monochrome 1.33:1 window that expands
out to a colorful 2.40:1 once the lead lands in Oz.  The transformation has an equally
profound effect on audiences today as the original film did in 1939  -- and that's perhaps
the only credit that I can give to the filmmakers. The production is filled with immense
set designs that are larger than life.  Our first look at the land of Oz is nothing short of
eye-popping. It almost takes your breathe away. I have never seen vivid color saturation
like this before.  One would think there were steroids in the plant food.  None of this
spectacular imagery would be possible if not for the ultra-sharp transfer that this Blu-ray
presentation provides.  Everything looks exactly as you would expect it to look, with
perfect coloration, nice inky black levels, and complete absence of encoding artifacts.
In a word, the visual presentation is ""flawless.""

So, as much as I hated OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL as a movie, I must confess that
I was very impressed with its 3D presentation, which seems to be a bit more fun in the
film's windowboxed 1.33.1 presentation as effects often get thrown out of frame.  The
Tornado sequence is particularly effective in 3D as we watch wind-hurled objects lunge
towards us as debris quietly floats and protrudes out of screen.  One would immediately
surmise that if so much effort was put into providing projectile 3D effects so early in the
story that there would be lots more.  Unfortunately that's only true for the first few moments
we arrive in Oz as birds and river fairies dart outside of the viewing area. As the story
progresses forward, however,  there seems to be far less emphasis placed on having objects
project themselves forward.  In fact, most props that are seemingly propelled towards the
audience (such as a fireball or thrown coinage) simply hit the confines of the display without
exceeding its boundaries. At one moment, late in the film, there's a rather effective 3D shot of
soldiers slinging their spears forward. However, at that point it's rather clear that the
filmmakers wanted to tone down all the projected gimmickry.  It's a shame, as this is the
kind of movie that would have clearly benefited from it.

The 3D process really brings the awe-inspiring set pieces to life with its added dimensionality,
which comes as no surprise since the film was shot in native 3D.  You get a real feel for
distance and depth, and quite often I was surprised by foreground objects that suddenly
came into frame.  You can tell that the filmmakers put consideration into how they composed
their shots and as such, this is one of the very best 3D presentations on Blu-ray that money
can buy.

Equally immersive is one of the liveliest DTS-MA soundtracks in recent memory.  The
surround activity effectively enhances the story with some really cool effect panning
across all the channels.  Make no mistake about it, there are some real powerful sonic
moments to savor, particularly the tornado sequence where I felt my subwoofer was
reaching its level of capacity.  I was quite pleased with the dynamics of the audio
presentation.

Note: For some odd, ungodly reason, the Blu-ray defaults to Dolby 2.0.  I guarantee
everyone will get the same sudden warning as they are just about to delve into the
presentation.  I don't understand why Disney did this other than the fact that perhaps
there were complaints from those who listen to their audio through regular TV speakers --
but even then, wouldn't the audio just downcovert anyway?  This has got to be one
of the most unconventional things the studio has done one of their prime Blu-ray releases....

...well, not the only unconventional thing.  As many are already aware, Disney has
suddenly given up the practice of including a standard 2D Blu-ray with their 3D counterpart.
I could endlessly rant about this experiment gone wrong, but I am certain that by now,
the folks at Disney Home Entertainment are well aware of anger from consumers like us.

OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL arrives with a Blu-ray 3D and Digital Copy.  I found
the overall packaging to be lackluster.  It's not the design that bothers too much, but for
the price being charged (and its shortage of 2D Blu-ray), I would have hoped for lenticular
artwork.

Want to watch some extra features after the film?  You are out of luck, bud.  The 3D
Blu-ray comes with no extras whatsoever other than a trailer for Monsters University.
Carefully hidden in the included inserts is an offer for the 2D Blu-ray with added features
for $5.99 (and added shipping).  Hmmmph!

No argument, OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL is a visually stunning treat to watch in
3D.  It comes from Disney, who has a reputation of releasing the best 3D titles on the
market.  This will certainly be placed high on my list of best 3D titles available.

If you have kids in your home, owning this 3D release is a no-brainer.  That being said, I
can't quite recommend this as a blind purchase for adults.  This is most certainly a
tedious film to watch thanks to its slow pacing, awful deadpan delivery and green-screen
reactions --- and most of all --- the inclusion of James Franco and Mila Kunis in the
lead roles.

If buying blind, do so with extreme caution.",1453075200,,8831,4.739528795811518

5638515,2,B00BL1BIP8,"First, the reason this is 2 stars, not 1. ""Oz"" does a decent job offering a fun explanation for how that Wizard ended up behind that curtain in the first place. That's it, mostly. This movie has its moments -- maybe 3 or 4 of them. But it's 20 minutes too long, horribly acted, and even more horribly directed. And the direction must be behind it all, the con artist behind the curtain. Even if you don't like James Franco, Mila Kunis, or Rachel Weisz, they're better than this. And Michelle Williams is almost unrecognizably bad. (And Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams really can act. Maybe not so much James 'I'm overacting as well as I can!' Franco or Mila 'Look into my eyes' Kunis)

Every time he has a chance, Sam Raimi takes 3 minutes when 1 would have done. You almost feel like checking your watch.

Even some of the special effects look bad -- bad green screening, unconvincing acting opposite 'synthespians.' And the little flying monkey companion? Some of the worst 3D I've seen in a long time.

The rehash of the Wizard's spectacular 1939 appearance in fire and smoke? It looks _worse_ in Sam Raimi's 2013 render! How?!

But the worst of it all? Mila Kunis can't hold a candle to Margaret Hamilton. Kunis can't hold a candle of any kind. Of course, Hamilton was a whopping 37 years old when she played the witch. Maybe 30 year-old Kunis didn't have enough experience. It doesn't help that she is given a ""come-hither"" witch dress and terrible make-up.

But ultimately, Kunis can't sell the line. James Franco, playing a con artist, can't sell it either.

Rachel Weisz gives it all away. At times, you wonder whether the look of shock and dismay is at the awful film she's stuck in.",1448668800,,1695,4.577557755775578

I thought this film was tentative and weak.  As much as I criticize Mila Kunis, I thought James Franco/Oscar just as inadequate as the wizard.  His interaction with the China Girl/Joey King was maudlin and weak.

Oscar is a con man.  A tornado carries him to the Land of Oz, where he meets Theodora, who falls in love with him.  Theodora's evil sister, Evanora played so confidently by Rachel Weisz, manipulates her.

It's a prequel to the Wizard of Oz.  But despite improved technology, it didn't match the magnificence of the Wizard of Oz, and even without the Wizard of Oz as a reference, the film was mediocre.  The story wasn't compelling, and the main roles were not in the least bit convincing.",1436572800,,943,4.753086419753086

Overall, the movie is well filmed in the usual grand Hollywood style, it's very visually sumptuous, but it's not really a story for the kids and it's not very intelligent either. If you are looking for a good quality movie to watch with your children, then I would recommend the recent animation that's coming out of Ireland: the beautiful Secret of the Kells or the Song of the Sea.

There were some thing which they followed from the original Wizard of Oz which were a nice touch like the small, black and write opening becoming full color, and characters from the opening being seen in the movie later (the monkey Finley was assistant Frank, China Doll was the girl in the wheel chair he could not fix, etc).  If you have expectations this is a phenomenal, slick adult movie you will be disappointed, if you'd like to escape with your kids on a very good adventure with lessons about treating people well, the importance of honesty, friends and family this is a great movie to try.",1427068800,,831,4.671232876712328

5638877,3,B00BL1BIP8,"While I admire the concept of the story being told I have a hard time getting past all the shortcomings. It's a great idea telling the story of how the Wizard of Oz (the character himself) came to be. Don't get me wrong. I just can't help but feel the idea would have been pulled off in better hands. The acting is unconvincing, many of the special effects are over the top, there are times when it feels like certain plot elements are missing. Oz the Great and Powerful is ultimately an entertaining film, but not a great film. For some of you it may even not be considered a particularly good film. To me it's not bad so I don't mind recommending it under certain conditions.

Ever wonder how the old ""Wizard"" at the end of the classic film Wizard of Oz came to be? Who was he back in Kansas before swept away to the Land of Oz? How did he become the mighty wizard that rules the Emerald City? This movie answers these questions by chronicling the adventures of Oscar Diggs (James Franco) from a carnival magician/con-man to a revered hero of a fantasy kingdom. It also chronicles the evolution of the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) from a good witch to the Wicked Witch of the West we all know and loath. This is a good premise. A lot of the ideas they use on this premise are good ones like how Theodora has internally based fire powers (which help explain her weakness to water in the classic film) and how Oz's ingenuity and flair for parlor tricks also tie in to the Wizard of Oz film. Plot-wise the film is rather solid.

Still the script does need work (more on that later), and there are certain plot points that felt underdeveloped. For instance the way they handled Theodora's transformation to a wicked witch felt stunted, and without any engaging development. They started to make it interesting, but then threw in a quick way out to get her into her green nasty self sooner than plot development would allow. Can't blame them for picking up the pace, but it did hurt her story. Another thing that got me perplexed is they put a great amount of attention to developing the origins of Oz and the witches, but left out one of the biggest plot points of the classic Wizard of Oz: The ruby slippers. There is absolutely no mention of them or how they came to be. Not even a hint. It would have been great to see some development on that.

Another good thing about this film is the cinematography. They make a fitting tribute to the classic movie by following a familiar cinematic theme. The early scenes with Oscar in Kansas are in a muted sepia filtered look that's not quite black and white, but definitely a means to show a less colorful setting. Then when he arrives on Oz the screen is filled with bright and vibrant colors. Also the screen's aspect range changes from a letterboxed 1.33:1 to a full 2.40:1 ratio. While the effect isn't going to be quite a stunning as somebody seeing The Wizard of Oz in theaters for the first time much ti done to replicate the experience in a way that would impress today's movie-goer.

I did say the film wasn't great. While the plot and cinematic effects are indeed impressive there are lots of unimpressive things as well. First off the actors really don't feel right for the roles. All of them. It feels like the actors are from a modern time pretending to be from the previous century. The dialog all around isn't convincing for the era, and neither is James Franco's facial hair (guy in that day had trimmed features or none at all... Franco has a contemporary light beard). The only exception I make is when Mila Kunis is transformed into the wicket witch, which she really eats up that part. Before her transformation though she felt just as out of place as the others. The actual acting isn't bad, but the finer details to put you in the period weren't there. So the movie doesn't really earn any points for acting.

Then you have the special effects, which were a mixed bag. The scenery and computer generated backdrops are very pretty and look good on a big screen. Makeup effects are top notch and just have to be seen to believe. Practical effects are wonderful and the inclusion of a porcelain girl done almost entirely by marionette is a real treat to watch. However when the computer animation kicks in it's either obvious or over-the-top campy. The movie was released in 3D and there are lots of effects shots that were obviously made to capitalize on that; to the point of annoyance. It's like Director Sam Raimi is still convinced that 3D is still just there to have things fly out of the screen and surprise you. Granted if you have seen many of Raimi's films this is the kind of special effects guy he is. Over the top. Still I feel it hurts the film by making it look like just another effects-laden example Hollywood excess.

The Blu-Ray looks great; even better on a big screen where you can get the full immersion experience. Even without a 3D disc you can feel the depth perception in many scenes. Audio is 7.1 DTS nearfield surround. All this means is the audio is designed for smaller home theater environments rather than larger venues or massive home theaters. It's really here nor there in the end, but I appreciate the audio is calibrated for the 99% who do not have stadium seating sized home setups. The extras and featurettes are all in high definition and round out with a good coverage of behind the scenes content. They are short with all but one running at ten minutes or less. Here's the list:

Walt Disney and the Road to Oz - This chronicles Walt Disney's own interest in making a live action feature film based on the Wizard of Oz books. You get to see a few projects he tried, but ultimately canned, and see how the evolution of his efforts led to one of Walt's greatest films.

My Journey in Oz, by James Franco - This is the longest of the featurettes and runs at a little over twenty minutes. James Franco put together a video log of his day on the set that includes a fair amount of interviews from cast and crew as well as a behind the scenes look to various aspects of film production. It's a nice making of documentary that has a personal slant to it.

China Girl and the Suspension of Disbelief - The porcelain doll on this film is one of the more impressive things you will see in the film. This very short extra gives you plenty of reason to love those scenes by showing you how they brought her to life.

Before Your Very Eyes: From Kansas to Oz - From sets to computer rendered backdrops to costumes. This featurette focuses on the world building aesthetic to the movie.

Metamorphosis - Did I mention the makeup effects were top notch? Here is an extra focusing on Mila Kunis' makeup transformation, which is major feather on this film's cap.

The Magic of Oz the Great and Powerful - I never use this. It's one of those ""second screen experience"" features where you can open up additional content while watching the movie using your mobile device. I prefer my extra features to be separate from the film so this is a non-starter for me.

Bloopers - It's a short five minute montage of missed lines and cracked jokes. Much of it is your standard fare, but there are a few really funny moments, and a couple CGI created antics along the way.

Mr. Elfman's Musical Concoctions - Composer Danny Elfman goes over his creation of the film's music score.

Oz the Great and Powerful is a flawed film to be sure, but it's not a bad film. If you are picky with your films, but can set aside some pet peeves I think you will find some good things here. If you are just a popcorn film buff on the mindset not to take things too seriously then I think you will have a blast. Oz the Great and Powerful is a proper prequel to the classic Wizard of Oz film. If they took the time to better refine the movie it would be a modern classic. As it stands you have decent flick worthy of Oz fans.",1426809600,,7880,4.424827586206897

5638925,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Hmm... this could have been so much better.
It would be easier to list the things that my daughter and I enjoyed about this movie than the number of things that failed.
The best character was the fascinating China Girl. She was adorable and was animated in the most intriguing way. When Oz first encountered her (as opposed to the living girl that she represented), the scene was very moving.
Oz was a decent character. Franco portrayed him with charisma while amply displaying his very obvious shortcomings.
The actors in general were good to adequate. There were no poor performances. Somehow I feel the direction was wooden.
The black and white world in the beginning sequence echoed the original.

The problem with this film was with the plot, the poorly rendered Land of Oz (animation), and general themes of the film. I have no doubt this was expensive to produce, but other than the China Girl, I don't see much to show for that expense. The costuming was strange and bland.
The greatest disappointment was the concept of a woman's worth being displayed chiefly in her appearance. For instance, a beautiful woman turning into a horrible hag because of her disillusionment in a man. This theme was repeatedly used throughout the movie to a ridiculous extent.
There were other elements in the film that were uncomfortable to a modern audience.
Also, there was no ""awakening"" of Oz's character at the end. The fantasy was the final word. It made me wonder what he would do if someone ""hotter"" than Glinda showed up.
The characters never looked like they were actually ""there"" in the Land of Oz. The backgrounds were continually distracting (and not in a good way) and fake looking.
I am very glad I did not pay to see this in the cinema.",1424649600,,1741,4.7269736842105265

I thought Mila Kunis's portrayal of the bad witch was also pretty flat and bland at least until she gets evil.  Even then, evil Mila Kunis did not really have enough loose screws to be really scary.",1424476800,,368,4.367647058823529

However, Franco is probably at his worst.  Kunis wasn't great either.  The colors and imagination of Oz were nice but lost amongst poor acting/actor choice and a bit of a lack luster story line.  I still watched to the end and would say it probably got better as it went.  I was midly amused and I do love a new take on a classic tale so that gets it a 3 instead of 2.

5638942,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Oz The Great And Powerful was just a mediocre movie. You would not be too repulsed by it nor think it was the best movie ever in that genre.

The movie entertained me so thats all that mattered but it fell short in the acting department for me. Franco and Kunis were slightly less than impressive in playing their roles. The action wasn't bad at all and the overall script didn't seem to present anything that looked ""Great and Powerful"" if I can use that pun. The story unfolded well to bring the audience into the world of Oz and introducing you to some of the key characters that I found much more vibrant that Franco's character.

This movie did engage me enough not to put me to sleep and to see how the wicked witch became the wicked witch we know from the Judy Garland film was a bit of a treat. Watch this but don't expect anything timeless like The Wizard of Oz.",1424304000,,871,4.2727272727272725

5638944,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Very much liked seeing this long overdue addition to the Oz masterpiece.

 Rarely do I ever watch a rated G or PG film but this one I took an exception because it is done so remarkably well.  In this movie we have great special effects visuals, interesting new (& some unknownly old) characters in the fantasy Oz franchise created by author Frank Baum.

 For fans of the original classic with Judy Garland, we never really get an origin or full explanation as to who the Witch of the East was or what the Wizard's origins were either. In fact for thought provoking adult fans who love the film, some of us may have asked, ""Who is this Wizard?""

 We do recall a line in the original, ""I am a Kansas man myself.""  So from that very short line of information we have today this prequel where Oz is a Kansas circus hustler who accidentally finds himself in the magical land of Oz.

The film as all of the elements which we had so loved & admired before, the munchkin town, the yellow brick road, the Emerald City (in more detail), and the flying monkeys.  But unlike the Judy Garland epic, there are no musical bits to this movie.

 Oz is mistaken by the locals to be this all powerful wizard,  due to a prophecy that their land would be saved by him. Along the way the Wizard runs into a beautiful young Witch who he seduces, then he cons the people of the Emerald City until he finds many of his tricks and gags are about to be exposed when he actually has to perform miracles as a leader.

 The explanation & origin story of both Wicked Witches, with the addition of Glinda who Oz also finds attractive & tries to seduce, are played out in this fun film for most ages.  I very much enjoyed this movie, and hope to see more Oz films because the author did write many different stories about his famous subject.",1424131200,,1808,4.320474777448071

5638957,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Whats it about?

A tornado hurls a small-time huckster magician, Oscar (James Franco), into a Wonderland-esque land overseen by three witch sisters (Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz). And where there be witches, there be wickedness. Which witch is which? (Spoiler: green face, hooked schnoz, much cackling.) Oscar, mistaken for a powerful wizard and rightful ruler, befriends a few locals and tries to keep the joint safe. Just in case a scarecrow, tin man, lion and Judy Garland turn up, in a far superior film, made 70 years beforehand.

What did I think?

Well, were off to see the wizardry, the wonderful visual-effects wizardry of Oz. And we get it  in a Skittles explosion of rainbow-hued CG. We also get a gorgeous, crippled china doll who steals the film and cured this reviewer of his lifelong detestation for porcelain dolls. But Ozs other fantastical curiosities pale next to the 1939 original: winged monkeys are replaced with winged baboons; Munchkins are now the ethnically inclusive Midget Union of North America; and instead of an engaging, rogueish wizard, we get James Franco.",1423958400,,1105,5.122222222222222

5638979,5,B00BL1BIP8,"*Please note that I am reviewing the Blu-Ray edition with digital copy*
I really dig fairytales and so I'm having such a field day with these many live-action remakes/retellings that have been coming out these past few years.  Some of them have been disappointing.  Many I've liked only portions or aspects of it.  A few, have really stood out in my mind..  So it has been an interesting ride.  But by far, ""Oz The Great And Powerful"" is one of my favorites of these recent live-action re-adaptations...and my particular favorite of all the ones Disney has done up to this point.  With heartfelt acting, relatable characters, a wonderful blending of classic physical movie/stage design with modern digital techniques...and a very lush and magical musical score...there is so much to draw you in.

CONTENT ISSUES:
There isn't much to worry about.  But, I would like to note that this is a darker retelling, and meant for older audiences (come on, the lead actor starts out as a womanizer and con artist).  There is one or two uses of ""D---"" if I remember correctly.  Also, the costumes for the witches follows the classical Victorian style infused with fantastical qualities...so this does mean a little top bust does show.  This is a much more serious take than Dorothy's.

ABOUT THE MOVIEW (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):

Few people realize that ""The Wizard of Oz"" was not just a film, but also a piece of literature.  And what even more people (such as myself) don't realize was that the land of Oz wasn't just a single book, but a series of books.  And this is where ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" derives much of it's ideas and general premise from.  This prequel is an amazing retelling of this classic tale as well as a wonderful set-up for a planned sequel (or set of sequels) retelling the legacy of Oz.  One thing for clarification about the film though, this installment takes place 20 years before Dorothy's arrival to Oz.  In addition, they mentioned that they aren't planning slipping in Dorothy too soon...especially not the sequel to this since there's so much more material before she needs to arrive.  There is a lot to love about this film, but for the sake of time, I will limit it to a few major ones.

The Beginning-
One thing I love is how they set the whole thing up.  The main theme is pretty well laid out in the synopsis of the DVD: can this illusionist with dubious ethics rise to the task of unraveling the intrigue that is in Oz.  What isn't mentioned is that part of this is adventure is in his internal struggles about his idea of friendship, his ability to be honest with others, honest with himself, and a materialization of the greatness he longs for but can't seem to fathom.  Though I won't be specific, the movie is circular in that it introduces these questions at the beginning, progresses and develops it through the film,and finally circles it back at the end.  The very first set of characters you meet will be very important...so do pay attention to them.  I won't blow it for you...but in case you can't completely figure it out by the end of the film, take time to read the credits for some of the answers ;-)  And another theme that is especially strong in this film is how a seemingly small & careless choice (and waiting for ""the right time"" to make up with people) can change destiny...it doesn't excuse people from the actions they take, but it can cause much sorrow or much joy that will be remembered in the hearts of said people.

Homage to Tradition-
I love their sense of tradition and respect to the source material...and the classic musical that came before it back in 1939.  Though they wanted to create something brand new and thought provoking, they also desired to create something that was nostalgic and sentimental.  From their ""black & white"" introduction to the film, to many many set ups for key characters of the original (we find out hints about how the lion became a coward, or where the scarecrow might have come from, to even how Dorothy [way in the future] will be able to squash a powerful witch with her Kansas house, etc.).  In addition, it's no secret that the film relies heavily on Computer Graphics (CG).  But with that said, the director did not want to completely lose the classic ""Big Hollywood"" feel of large, intricate sets...so, they built massive and simply beautiful sets that the actors would act in...with CG being used to fill the gaps and make what was already physically grand even grander.  But as to the CG aspect of it...seriously some of the best CG I've seen...Finnly the flying monkey and the China Girl look so lively, personable, and just plain adorable at times...and their interaction with the live actors is spot on brilliant.

MAGIC:
A lot of films that try and become ""darker"" often go a grungier more ""real"" route.  The problem with this is that it often loses some of the sense of magic that made the original tale...well...magical and fantastic.  Somehow, even though this film is darker and heavier in it's tone and themes, they manage to keep a true sense of fantasy and wonder that leaves you feeling inspired and warm.  This is indeed Oz...not some weakened, post-apocalyptic city that happens to bear the name.

The Music-
This goes without out saying...it's so good and an active mood setter in the film.  This is the soundtrack that got me to respect Danny Elfman's work...up 'til now, he was just ""another film composer"" to me.  The tracks are varied, yet unified and help build the moments, too!  The ""China Town"" score and the ""Fireside Dance"" (which becomes a recurring theme that morphs as the film progresses) are especially powerful... the ""China Town"" one in particular is such a tear jerker when coupled with the scenes.

The Acting-
In my opinion, they owned it.  Such a fantastical film runs an easy risk of turning into absolute cheese and campiness.  This cast made me take them seriously...they made me believe in Oz.  And the CG-based characters?  They made them so real!  I'm speaking in terms of the voice acting, and the visual mannerisms.  Like my title said, I actually even felt teary-eyed for the porcelain doll character.  And what they did with the wicked witch!  Though, I still have no sympathy for her choices...I do feel some sorrow for her circumstances.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
The Blu-Ray is packed with some awesome special features.  Their are mini documentaries (generally 20 minutes to a half hour) covering a wide variety of topics  concerning the production process.  There's a general documentary/interview where James Franco interviews different folks from the actors/actresses up to the director.  There's another feature that discusses Walt Disney's ""obsession"" with Oz and trying to (but failing) to produce ""the work of his dreams""...and how this fulfills his wish.  There's another feature discussing Danny Elfman's process of film scoring.  And still another discussing the Puppet Masters role in the success of the creation of the ""China Girl"" character (he used a 21-string puppet!!!!).  And a few more features as well.

ALL IN ALL:
This is one of my favorite live-action adaptations of a Fairytale...and definitely my top favorite of those that Disney has produced up to this point.  It has so much heart and meaning.  And the more I watch it, the more connections and gems I pull from it.  And though it is a much darker film than Judy Garland's (which still deserves the title of ""Classic"" and ""Definitive"" in every way) it manages to remain hopeful and keep the magic alive.  I look forward to seeing the sequel (and hopefully sequels) to see how this illusionist truly earns the title of ""The Wizard of Oz"".",1422489600,,7662,4.758333333333334

The story of the ""wizard"" (played well by James Franco) and his encounters with the three witches (Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, and Michelle Williams) shows the evolution of a circus con-man into a caring wizard-man.

I am almost 60 years old and have seen the Wizard of Oz at every Christmas or Easter showing, depending on the year, while I grew up and it is still one of my favorites.  To have the guts to try and do a prequel that remained faithful to the original took a lot of guts and, by golly, it worked!

Mila Kunis deserved an oscar for her tribute to Margaret Hamilton.  That actress is one class act, Mila that is, and had she not played the character as she did, I think the entire movie would have been a flop.  Don't get me wrong, the acting from everyone was top notch and wonderful, but, Kunis made the movie another classic.

Don't want to critique the entire movie because, if you haven't seen it, I don't want to give anything away but I will say it incorporates some clever adult humor, as in the original, and jokes a little about the first being a musical.  Other than that, I will say nothing other than this is one of the few ""part two's"" that works and it works big time.  Love the flick.",1419897600,,1015,4.1692307692307695

5639104,1,B00BL1BIP8,"I got about 2/3rd's through this computer-generated mess and had to give up. This hardly feels like a prequel to the 'Wiaard of Oz', although there are labored elements that seem to try, and fail, to bridge the two (such as ripping off the black and white opening sequence and the inevitable segue into color, etc.) The effects looks fake, especially things such as the butterflies that seem more about showcasing 3D effects (that fall flat to those watching this in 2D) with very little genuine character development. James Franco just looks and feels like a third-rate Johnny Depp clone, and plays Oz, the protagonist of the story, and like so many Disney films lately he's a deceptive, manipulative yet handsome male character - a trend that Disney seems to churn out in everything they make these days (Frozen, anyone?) It's getting to the point of feeling like an ugly stereotype. The film meanders and is so saturated in computer generated effects it starts to feel like watching a Star Wars prequel, not a Wizard of Oz prequel. It gets tedius, and in the story the elements of magic are diminshed for a MacGyverish/A-team-ish final battle sequence was just too much. I gave up when the terrifying, not-kid-safe-monkeys started to fall asleep in the poppys. I felt the same sleepy exhaustion with this mess.",1416787200,,1313,4.866071428571429

5639140,3,B00BL1BIP8,"In the running commentary for ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" (a low-budget horror spoof -- and a good one), the writer/director remarks that ""You're taught in screenwriting school not to create reactive characters."" In other words, your protagonist should be actively attempting to reach a goal, rather than simply trying to avoid something. A reactive character lacks the motivation needed to keep the story going -- which can result in second-act collapse -- and is hard for the audience to identify with. I know this from experience, having written three treatments that fell apart in front of my eyes, before recognizing my mistake. Never again.

The screenwriters for ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" didn't fully appreciate this. Oscar Diggs is trying to escape Oz and avoid his prophesized responsibility to kill a wicked witch. Sure, he wants the gold in the King's vault, and he makes out with every pretty face that comes along, but frankly -- who cares? Almost every man wants wealth and women.

It doesn't help that Oscar is thoroughly unsympathetic. It's not that he's bad, it's that his behavior is wholly driven by self-interest. As he says to one of his intended conquests, ""I don't want to be good -- I want to be great!"" This is the issue at the center of the story -- are humans basically altruistic (""good""), or selfish (""bad"")? (It also applies to Theodora.)

The audience badly wants to see Oscar discover his innate goodness. * This is the story's goal, obliging the writers to create //dramatic// situations in which we //see// Oscar struggling with his selfishness, and gradually rising above it -- not experiencing the abrupt and weakly motivated conversion that occurs late in the film.

//Showing// a character's moral and intellectual progression is harder than everything else in screenwriting put together. McKee says ""Master storytellers never explain. They do the hard, painfully creative thing -- they dramatize. ... Dialogue, the natural talk of characters pursuing desire, is not a platform for the filmmaker's philosophy. ... A great story authenticates its ideas solely within the dynamics of its events; failure to express a view of life through the pure, honest consequences of human choice and action is a creative defeat no amount of clever language can salvage. ...the story's meaning, whether comic or tragic, must be dramatized in an emotionally expressive Story Climax without the aid of explanatory dialogue."" (""Story"", p114)

The writers have largely failed to do this -- which is why reviewers say the film ""lacks heart"", and why James Franco's performance is so often criticized.

Nevertheless, ""Oz"" is worth seeing once -- on Blu-ray, not DVD. It is one of the most spectacularly beautiful films I have ever seen. There's an attempt to give the //impression// of three-strip Technicolor, with intensely vivid -- but never garish -- hues. It's definitely a demo disk.

* This parallels Baum's original story, which posits that we all possess wisdom, love, and courage -- the things needed to get through life -- and need only express them.",1415318400,,3080,5.075098814229249

For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews. Just a quick review of this movie...

Oz The Great And Powerful (2013) is a prequel to The Wizard Of Oz (1939). This is just an ""OK"" movie. The acting is mediocre. The musical score is just run-of-the-mill, nothing spectacular. The CGI special effects are plentiful. TOO plentiful. And once again, like so many modern movies, the CGI looks so fake, like a video game. CGI was meant to make things look more real. Instead, it seems to be having the opposite effect. While there are quite a few well done scenes, this movie falls flat in its ability to grab this reviewer. The characters are just sort of ""there"" and I never really cared much for any of them. In contrast, in The Wizard Of Oz, the focus was on the well being of Dorothy and her friends in Oz. The Wizard Of Oz was character and story driven and that's what makes it have a powerful and lasting impact on so many people. The special effects used were state-of-the-art for the time period, but they were inserted to help tell the larger story. In contrast, the special effects in Oz The Great And Powerful seem to be inserted so they can be on display, something to look at and be dazzled by. That's the case with so many movies these days - I always notice that whenever a scene comes on that contains CGI special effects, it seems that there's a little pause while the effects are on the screen, as if to say, ""Hey audience, check out what we did with our computer. Aren't you impressed?"" This seems to be the case, rather than having a special effect on screen that naturally flows with the scene. I must say, however, that some of the atmosphere in this movie was well done, particularly scenes showing the Emerald City, sunlight, clouds, nighttime, etc. I didn't like the Wicked Witch Of The West in this movie. She seemed so different compared to Margaret Hamilton in the original movie and I couldn't visualize this woman fitting the image of the older Wicked Witch Of The West that we all know from The Wizard Of Oz. I also didn't like the wizard in this movie. He seemed so different compared to Frank Morgan, who is THE Wizard Of Oz. Michelle Williams was OK in her role, nothing great.

I remember seeing the preview for this movie in the movie theater a few years back and my first thought was that the makers of this movie are deliberately doing a PREQUEL to The Wizard Of Oz instead of a straight remake, because they're probably afraid (and rightfully so) to do a remake. Instead, they're doing a prequel, and if it does well at the box office and gets good reviews, then the makers of this movie will basically ask the general public if it's OK to go ahead and do a remake of The Wizard Of Oz. In other words, the makers of Oz The Great And Powerful are tip-toeing their way to making a remake of The Wizard Of Oz. Whether or not a remake is made remains to be seen. Based on the mediocre reviews this movie has gotten, I think a remake is unlikely, but you never know. I hope a remake never happens. There's only one The Wizard Of Oz.

I recommend seeing this movie once if you're curious.",1402704000,,3174,4.400340715502556
5639373,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Great visual effects, the film is nice to look at.  The story line was better than I expected while trying to stay true to the later story line.

5639386,3,B00BL1BIP8,It was ok. The graphics were appealing but I do agree with another reviewer that it looked like a Dr. Seuss set sometimes. I think it could've been written better and the actors did the best with what they had to work with. I do believe Johnny Depp would've made a great Wizard of Oz. All in all it just seemed to be lacking heart. I found myself not really rooting for anyone in particular and lost interest before the end.

5639428,4,B00BL1BIP8,"I always tell everyone that I grew up in a family of bookworms. Hence my name is from my Mom's favorite novel. But

What most don't know is that my childhood is also filled up with breat adventure movies - The Oddyssey, The Never

Ending Story, Land Before Time, Fern Gully, An American Tale, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonerland and my all-time

favorite The Wizard of Oz.

I know the story was based on a book by L. Frank Baum, although Ive never read one. And that 1939 movie with Judy

Garland is a timeless classic. And now when all things classic are being recycled, I wasn't suprised that Oz will

be one of them. So it is a prequel to the timeless Oz every child grew up watching. And I'm glad they did because

it wasn't murdered, butchered even like those old movies being re-vamped. It was given justice and it kinda shed

the light for everyone to meet the real Wizard, very much human but worked on to be 'great' and 'powerful'.

First time Ive seen it, I got entertained. Sam Raimi did a great great job with the special effects. I like the

idea that it was black-and-white in the real world and then, all cinemascope and colorful as soon as the Wizard

reaches Oz. The story is very simple. A carnival magician/ con-man/ heartbreaker had to leave the circus for

getting into trouble. The balloon he was riding got stuck in a hurricane. During the 'bumpy' ride, he promised to

change his ways, be a good man, blah blah. As if heard by the Heavens, his balloon safely touched down in Oz and

he was left unharmed. Thats when he started meeting witches, mystical animal, etc. And is bound to save a Kingdom

from an evil Wicked Witch.

The second time I watched it. I was not there to be entertained anymore. I put my thinking cap on. And refused to

be distracted by the breath taking view of Oz.

The characters in Oz were mere representations of Oscar Diggs' failed relationships in real life. The witches were

past lovers. Glinda the Good and the woman he left at the Circus were even played by Michelle Williams, how

obvious could that be. The bell-hop-clad monkey Finley is his carnival assistant Frank, 'who just wanted his

friendship' and little china girl was the same girl who asked the Magician to make her walk. And he did make her

walk. In Oz, if that counts.

Let's talk about the Wizard. I was a bit doubtful when I first heard that James Franco was to play the Wizard of

Oz. James Franco is obviously at the pinnacle of his career. The wizard being a ladies' man, not too serious about

life or even at his craft. After watching Franco in This is the End, the role fits him perfectly. Creepy.

Mila Kunis is a gem. I love, love, love the transformation of her character from the beautiful innocent witch

Theodora to the green wartsy broom-flying Wicked Witch. I was hoping she would sing Defying Gravity any moment.

She may not have sung but she delivered indeed. Her voice was sweet as a pretty witch but was so angry when she

turned green. So why green? Emerald City? The Wizard's favorite color? Green-eyed monster? Could be. Green because

it's the color of decay. And as her sister Evanora, the real Evil witch, said, ""That's your heart withering

away...""

There were twists - who's the real evil bitch I mean, witch among the three. There was also romance. And action -

the 'war' between Evanora's Army and the good citizens of Emerald City from tinkers, farmers to munchkins. But my

favorite part was when Oz took on his 'ethereal form' and fooled the enemies, his greatest trick ever. And I guess

that's where the heart of the movie is. The city believed in him. Glinda was able to see right through him but

nevertheless, still believed in him. And he delivered. Not by magic, or curse, or spells like a real wizard would

but he used what he knows best. And he drove the enemies away. At the end of the day, he still got the results

they wanted.

As this movie presents a pretty picture for the visual senses, but is poorly written, horribly acted and worst of all boring beyond belief.  Franco, who it have liked in other things, simply can't hold this mishmash of a story together.  He plays an inherently unlikable character, which I think might be part of the problem.  Franco's Oz is neither villainous enough to be a villain, nor likable enough to make you root for or care about him and his journey.

This movie basically is like a fulfilling modern portrayal to the original Wizard of OZ. This movie created the same sensational use of the tornado to start the story with a believable storm. It also goes beyond the original with the added computer generated effects entertaining the viewer from the beginning tornado to the creation of OZ's legacy and empire all based on smoke and mirrors.

Perfect acting all the way from the opening carnival to the final showdown between the Wicked Witches versus OZ, The Good Witch, and company. The perfect acting was supported by James Franco (Also in the movie Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Michelle Williams (Also in the movie Marilyn Monroe), Mila Kunis (Also in the movie Black Swan), and Rachel Weisz (Also in the The Bourne Legacy).",1397606400,2,903,4.708860759493671

5639478,4,B00BL1BIP8,"I'll admit to being hugely disappointed when I heard Robert Downey Jr. backed out of this picture, he was the main reason I *really really* wanted to see it.

That said, James Franco is an OK replacement at best. My biggest problem with Franco and his films is that he's either fantastic or seems like he's bored to tears with the material Most of the time, it's the latter. However, his performance in Oz is middle of the road. Through about the first half, he's hos typical stoic, wooden self, but then he picks it up around the middle and ends fairly strong, if not a little over the top, something that I think Downey is much more adept at pulling off than Franco, so yes, I wish Downey had stayed on.

The story is actually pretty solid. Remember that this isn't a re-make of the original Wizard of Oz, it's a prequel. Sure, it's not great and it certainly wouldn't win an Oscar for best screenplay, but it entertains and I personally found it to be very enjoyable..

SFX wise, it's a definite home run. Very colorful and lively. Perfect for the land of Oz.

The supporting cast is pretty good as well. I loved Zach Braff as Money and Joey King as China Girl Mila Kunis was all right as Theodora, but I preferred Rachel Weisz's Evanora by a longshot. Kunis seemed though she was forcing the wickedness out of herself, whereas, Weisz seemed to transition seamlessly from salty princess to wicked witch like it was nothing.

In the end, it's a rent-worthy movie, though I wouldn't buy it unless you really enjoyed it a lot. It's a fun time and if you just let it entertain you, you'll probably like it a lot more.",1396396800,,1616,4.427609427609427

5639480,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Repeatedly hearing that it's not very good, I put off watching this for quite a while. While it would be impossible to completely capture the ambiance of the original WIZARD OF OZ, I still found OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL to be an enjoyable prequel. Good props and special effects, but it's hard to recreate Munchkinland, the Emerald City, and all the rest without making them seem like mere parodies of their originals. OGP has a solid plot-line, but again, it just needs something more, and I'm not, alas, sure what that something is (more development and explanation of the whole mythos of OZ, with a few flashbacks, perhaps?) The makers of this film had a lot to pack into 130 minutes, and some of the scenes are a bit hurried. It may also have been a mistake to echo Dorothy's later plight so closely, with the Wizard following the road to true OZ, picking up cohorts along the way. {Still, the little china girl is quite endearing.}

As many have noted, Rachel Weisz truly steals the show as Evanora (the Wicked Witch of the East), who, interestingly enough, turns her sister Theodora (WW of the West, languidly played by Mila Kunis) green by giving her an apple of the same color reminiscent of the fatal fruit in Genesis. There are several other eccentricities of plot like this, and I would have welcomed a few more.

Thematically speaking, it's not completely baked, but there's nevertheless a lot  to ponder if you're into it: the mirrors and bubblegum hoakum of the ""Wizard"" contrasted with the varying yet authentic powers of the witches, good, evil, and how the knowledge of same can make them what they are, etc. I've noticed a number of complaints about the lack of a truly good central character, but this lack is one of the biggest reasons why I like it. Everyone (not the least of which are the two wicked witches) has attractive, sympathetic qualities, and everyone (most of all, perhaps, the ""Wizard,"" but even Glinda the good witch) has their own little selfish agendas. If these aspects of the film interest you, I recommend reading Gregory Maguire's excellent novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-The-Life-and-Times-of-the-Wicked-Witch-of-the-West-Wicked-Years/dp/0061350966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Wicked Years)</a>, if you haven't already.

Anyhoo, there are all sorts of reasons for liking and disliking this film, which is a good quality in itself. Although really young children may have some trouble following it, kids of all ages who aren't prone to ruthless over-analysis should  enjoy OGP pretty well just for the ride it gives.",1396310400,,2675,5.1402298850574715

5639483,2,B00BL1BIP8,"Let me start by saying Zach Braff stole the movie. I didn't even know he was in the film until he randomly showed up in the first scene. His acting and voice acting were nothing short of amazing.

The rest of the star studded cast fell greatly short, especially Mila Kunis. Throughout the first portion of the movie it seemed like the director told her to whisper throughout every scene so that the audience wouldn't know how bad of an actor she really is. Sidebar: Normally I like her, but she really seemed out of her element, especially in the beginning of the movie. As it progressed, she seemed to have a better grasp of things. None of the main actors were all that convincing and I found myself bored at several points of the story because of this.

Synopsis:
James Franco plays the shady wizard OZ, whose main goal is to trick his audience using all of his questionable techniques he has available. He is brought to the land of Oz in a tornado and expected to help settle the unrest that is happening. Not being a real wizard, he uses his bag of tricks (literally) to help him on his journey. He meets up with a ragtag group of friends along the way (much like Dorothy) and  uses their special skills to help him defeat the wicked witches.

The movie had a lot to live up to being associated with an incredible franchise. Unfortunately, it was simply another overhyped, CGI based flick that strayed way too far away from its roots. Many of the actors were clearly unfamiliar with CGI work as many scenes seemed strangely awkward. Hollywood needs to realize that a name will only take you so far, you need to have content to back it up. The makers of this movie should feel ashamed that they besmirched the greatness of Oz and its inhabitants, fiction though they may be.",1396051200,,1778,4.478395061728395

I was looking forward to downloading the MP4 file, then put it one of my external hard drives, then play it direct to my Samsung high def TV WITHOUT having to have an internet connection available, AND/OR either play it on my Apple computer (no thank you, the thunderbolt to display port connection creates snow with video on the Apple system), or my Windows computer through Apple Quicktime or stream it from Amazon (which I can do on a Chromebook).

I understand the concern for the overt level of piracy that is going on in this world, but as a purchaser of this movie, I should be able to download the MP4, and if there is a blackout of internet connectivity, play it direct from an external hard drive. Currently, if I want to watch this movie, I will pretty much restrict myself to playing the DVD or the Blu-ray exclusively. Ultimately, I really want to play the digital content direct off of an external hard drive, which is MUCH closer to my TV versus having to stream it online, which is really pointless since I already have it in DVD and Blu-ray formats.

5639525,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Directed by Sam Raimi and Produced by Joe Roth, starring James Franco as Oz, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams as the three witches. Released through Walt Disney Pictures worldwide. Based on the original Oz series of fantasy novels written by Frank Baum.

Storyline: Oscar Diggs (Oz) is a small time magician in a small circus entertaining people. One day he gets engulfed into a tornado that hits the circus and suddenly enters a mysterious beautiful land of fantasy land, the Oz. There he encounters two wicked witches Evanora and Theodora who rule the Emerald City, but trick Oz to believe a story that they are being threatened by another witch called Glinda, living in the dark forest. The entire township of Oz believe in a legend that a great wizard is going to arrive to save them from calamity and celebrate the arrival of Oz. Meanwhile Oz while encountering Glinda in her territory, discovers that the true wicked witch is Theodora and not Glinda. He falls in love with the beautiful Glinda and saves the people of Oz from the destruction of the other two wicked witches, through his intelligence of trick magic created through a projector and smoke device. Glinda ultimately gains the throne of Emarald City with the help of Oz, after banishing Theodora and Evanora permanently from the kingdom. Oz becomes a hero forever in that free kingdom.

Positives: The best thing about this movie is its exquisite graphics and screenplay. The rich colors used in the astonishing landscapes created graphically, simply leaves the audience awestruck. One would have a feeling of visiting such lands of Oz at least once in their dreams. The Art Director, Robert Stromberg should be specially applauded for his design of the sets. Great cinematography and music. Mila Kunis was too beautiful to be called as a Witch. James Francos performance can be treated as one of his best. One can enjoy this movie in 3D with family on a weekend and worth having it as a collection in their library for its lovely ethnic graphics.

Negatives: The movie somehow failed to take success path in countries other than United States due to lack of proper marketing. Many missed this beautiful movie in theatres thinking it to be a kids movie.

I found it to be an extremely well-done prequel that blended the classic film with modern visual effects and contemporary pacing.  I watched Great and Powerful back-to-back with ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Return to Oz"" and it honestly came off as the strongest of the three from my 2014 perspective.  That's a skewed viewpoint as the three cross copyright issues and decades and are all very different in their presentation but it does illustrate that Great and Powerful is a very solid film in its own right.

The 3D effects are top-notch with all the tracking and masking done right.  The shortfalls you see in a film like John Carter are gone.  Everything works and it works well.  The film also does its own tribute to the classic's presentation, not only shifting from black and white to color but also from 1930s movie screen standard to widescreen as we enter the magical land of Oz.  The visuals are well-thought out and tailored to match the matte painting look of the classic film.

Oz and Glenda are both remarkable.  Glenda is a grand portrayal of the character in the books and light-years ahead of the good witch we've seen before.  Oz is as good as the character in the classic film.

Like the classic, this tale also seems to be a dream as it directly connects to the ""real-life"" opening scenes.  What's lost here is that the China doll is the girl from the wheel chair.  That's unfortunate as one of the films great sub-plots is lost if you miss this point.  I only detected it through the credits at the end of the film.

The flying monkey is superb!  I can't imagine anyone not liking him.

The fall of the Wicked Witch of the West is the only uncertain part of the film.  Her backstory radically changes her character and makes her fairly sympathetic.  Its hard to completely hate her watching the classic knowing that she is also a victim.  Its hard not to view Oz in a somewhat negative light knowing his role in her demise.  I found this acceptable as the Oz character here is closer to the Frank Baum character than the one in the classic film.  Their interaction does give all the characters a lot more dimension.

In truth, there needs to be at least two more films to take us from Great and Powerful to the classic.  This is a great first step but the transition is incomplete.",1393027200,,2363,4.5165094339622645

It feels as low budget when they spent so much money.
The story of the animated cinderella 2 feels like an oscar script compared to this.
There is no way that it would appeal to a kid older than twelve.

I cant really write all the things i could have if i had my laptop.

5639559,2,B00BL1BIP8,"There are great film, good films, bad films, awful films, and then there's Oz The Great and Powerful which occupies some nether class of movie that is neither here nor there. The problems are many for this film: From the start, it is clear that this film is going to be played for laughs which made me wonder why the otherwise stellar cast agreed to sign on to something that was clearly intended to milk the Wizard of Oz's pedigree while at the same time having virtually nothing to do with it. (This is to say that to enjoy this movie on any level, one has to suspend a belief in any connection between the original and whatever this film is. If you don't, the problems are magnified.) Among the stellar cast, only Franco seems at home in his role while Williams, Weiss, and Kunis uncomfortably ham it up. Sure, you could expect Braff to ham it up since he's here, but this only served to further tarnish the original's good name. Over and over I could not fathom why they all agreed to do this film. As far as the SFX are concerned, this film boasts mediocre effects which harmed the film by being so widely utilized. It would have been better to use fewer effects and make them top-notch rather than blind us with color saturation from beginning to end. Of course, all the razzle is meant to distract us from the fact that there is no dazzle to the story. On a positive note, I will say that this is a proper Disney film in the sense it has a dark undertone which is oddly more reminiscent of Tim Burton than Sam Raimi.

This was no fun to watch. Except for the beginning of the opening scene at the circus, and the introduction of the flying monkey, this was boring. There was no charm (Disney should be ashamed!). It looked like the actors stood in front of a blue screen and read their lines. And that balloon crash was too long and boring. Same with the stupid flowers.
I did like the idea of filling in the Wizard's back story. There were some wonderful nods to the original Oz (the books, not the famous movie) -- Baum circus, friend's name is Frank, including the china girl and the Quadlings, the emerald glasses, etc --  but all in all, a horrible insult. It was trite (black and white at the beginning, really? And a tornado? Again? Green witch? Couldn't they have at least looked at the original artwork?).
The good points were too few to justify two stars for me, but it really was close to two stars. I won't say don't watch it. I will say don't buy it.

The Wizard of Oz is one of my all time favorite movies, so I didn't expect to enjoy this, but I might like this prequel even better than the original. I can't believe anyone would criticize this film. I wish Hollywood would put out more movies like this. I guess over 2000 reviews generating a 4.5 star rating says the majority feel the same way.

5639585,5,B00BL1BIP8,"As an extreme lover of the original movie (I own it in several media), I am extremely leary of any movie that has anything to do with The Wizard of Oz. So when I read they were making a movie about how the wizard becomes the wizard, I ranted & raged that they were going to ruin the story. Plus, how would a good looking James Franco ever become Frank Morgan's wizard? A lot of questions ran through my mind. I had many conversations with friends about how this movie would never compare to the original. What about the Munchkins (my personal favorite characters, after the wicked witch), how would they be created? And the witch? Who could possibly play the part of a Margaret Hamilton witch?
Well the movie came out. Of course I saw it in 3D. All my rantings left me. I was awed by the beauty of this movie. I fell in love with it! The writers did a great job in telling the wizard's story, but could've done better with the dialog. And it's also the witches' story. We learn how those 3 characters become who they are in the WOO. In a way, this movie has nothing to do with WOO because that was Dorothy's story.
But I still have issues with the new movie:
1. The costumes weren't as outrageous as they were in WOO, especially the Munchkins.  One of my favorites is the ""shoes"" the Munchkins wear, with the flower on the front bopping around. Where were those? Their costumes were plain, not colorful at all.
2.  I really enjoyed James Franco, but he's still too good looking to turn into Frank Morgan.
3.  Same goes for Mila Kunis. She was also much too pretty to become Margaret Hamilton's wicked witch, especially after she changed into the witch.
4.  Emerald City was nothing like it is in the original. Are we to assume that it was reconstructed later on?
5.  And what about the balloon Oz travels in to the land of Oz? In WOO, Oz still has his original balloon. In the new movie, it gets destroyed and the tinker builds him a new one. Bad continuity.
6.  The new movie shows that Oz might have been imagining the whole thing. Consider this: he lands in a world that happens to be his name, Glinda happens to be the woman he really loves (Annie), the China girl has broken legs like the girl at the festival whom he couldn't 'fix', his friend Frank is a monkey (he refers to Frank as a monkey during an argument). But the interesting thing is Annie when she tells Oz that she got a marriage proposal from a man whose last name is Gale, which is Dorothy's last name. So does she become Dorothy's mother? In making this reference, is this then an actual event (in the story) or is it still Oz's imagination?
As anyone who reads this can see, I am a fanatic when it comes to the Wizard of Oz. If you love the story, I believe you will love Oz, The Great and Powerful, even with all my comments and speculations. It's still an absolutely amazing, visually stunning movie.",1391212800,,2874,4.33271375464684

5639622,2,B00BL1BIP8,"Oz the Great and Powerful is the second in what seems to be a series of Mad Libs in which Disney takes a quirky director (Sam Rami), a quirky star (James Franco), and a public domain children's property (Oz), and provides an unnecessary  addition to the story. The first of these was 2010's Alice in Wonderland (Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Alice in Wonderland). Perhaps next will be Edgar Wright directing Joaquin Phoenix in the story of a grown up Pinocchio (just kidding (I hope)).

So James Franco plays the titular Oz, starting out as a sepia toned stage magician and huckster who makes really poor choices in philandering. After a couple of incidents to indicate that he does have a heart beneath his sleazy interior, he is off in a balloon into a tornado and off to the Magical Land of OZ. There he meets 3 witches and a variety of colorful characters that have what he needs to ultimately become the hero OZ needs.

On the whole I thought the movie was fairly predictable, with ""twists"" that only work if you were unfamiliar with OZ. James Franco was off putting as Oz and I didn't really buy his charm. Zach Braff manages to phone in 2 roles (not that they gave him much to do). Also, while pretty, there are times when the characters are experiencing the land of OZ that look less coherent than when Eddie Valiant went to Toontown.

On the positive side, the female cast is uniformly pretty good. My favorite was the China Girl voiced by young Joey King, although Michelle Williams' smarter than she looks Glinda was a close second. Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz are fine as a pair of witchy sisters (though Kunis gets a little hammy toward the end). There were also a few honest and unexpected laughs, but sadly too far between.

I feel the film suffers from trying to be related to the 1939 classic (while not actually being able to directly reference that film). It starts off with the same limited sepia toned beginning where you meet some characters who will be oddly familiar later, and later on it throws in a random Munchkin musical number that isn't really as funny as the movie thinks it is. Also, the movie was filmed for 3D and there were a lot of things flying toward the camera.

I couldn't really recommend this movie. It isn't that good on its own, and doesn't really add anything to the OZ mythos. If you want a good Sam Rami movie, watch the first two Spider-Man movies or Army of Darkness. If you need an OZ fix watch the original or read Wicked.",1389744000,,2473,4.484444444444445

5639649,5,B00BL1BIP8,"The imagineering digital animation makes this feature visually stimulating to watch.  I had to watch it several times to really synthesize what I'd just seen.  Up front, the wizard is sort of metaphorical for the cinemaship and illusionist genius of Disney himself.

While the whole world is familiar with Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, this movie attempts a sketch of how Oz came to have a wizard before Dorothy's arrival.  For all of the flash and bang, and the colors which are seemingly exploding off the screen, there's a very dark social caste system in the land of Oz.  Only those racially adept in magical arts are rulers.  (Not muggles, like the Wizard).

It is because these rulers don't all agree with one another that Oz has fallen upon dark times.  I'd watch this again, if only to behold the wondrous transformation of Theodora into the wicked Witch of the West.  How she revels in the discovery she's evil.  I think it rises to the level of epic tragedy how she's been monstrously used and doesn't even know who's behind it.

5639666,5,B00BL1BIP8,How can you equate any other movie to The Wizard of Oz. I was hopeful that this one would delve further into the Oz background and still be interesting to watch. This movie does both. I have liked Franco in the past and was happy to see him do a good job in this one. The storyline with the witches was very informative and the character of Oz was linked very well between movies. I watched it 4 times looking for connections to The Wizard Oz and was challenged every time.,1388793600,,473,4.208791208791209
5639667,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) was directed by Sam Raimi and stars James Franco, Michelle Williams, Rachel Weisz, and Mila Kunis.

What chance has a prequel in comparison to the most beloved film of all time? Director Raimi makes a valiant effort with Oz the Great and Powerful. The story of how the wizard originally journeyed to Oz and became an ally of good witch Glinda and an adversary of bad witch Theodora is fairly well done and the visual effects are delightful. But there's just no getting around James Franco's ham fisted performance. The rest of the cast does fine including my favorite character, the animated flying monkey, Finley. But let's face it, the characters and performances in the 1939 classic are heads and shoulders above what's offered in this film (with the exception of Michelle Williams' sweetly empathetic Glinda). Half-dollar-eyed Mila Kunis gives it her best shot as the green wicked witch but she doesn't stand a chance against Margaret Hamilton's iconic (and terrifying) performance. The very lovely Abigail Spencer has a small but enjoyable part. Franco is simply miscast. I've read that Robert Downey Jr. was Raimi's first choice for the wizard and there's no doubt he would have been a much better fit for the role.

Fifty years from now they'll still be talking about the 1939 classic but I imagine very few will remember Oz the Great and Powerful, which pretty much sums it all up.",1388793600,,1422,4.871900826446281

5639672,5,B00BL1BIP8,"It's a daunting task for any director to tackle the world of L. Frank Baum in light of the masterful 1939 version of ""The Wizard of Oz"".  With a few references to that film director Sam Raimi puts his own stamp on that place somewhere over the rainbow.  This film acts as a prequel of sorts with the story of how a charlatan magician named Oscar Diggs(James Franco) became the Great and Powerful in the time before Dorothy Gale's red ruby slippers trod the yellow brick road to the Emerald City.  The main plot concerns a power play between the forces of the Good Witch (Michelle Williams) and the not so good witches (Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis) for control of Oz and how they're using Oscar for their devices.  Good backstory and terrific characterization and performances.  The visuals are eye-popping but they don't overwhelm the narrative.

5639680,3,B00BL1BIP8,"It is clear that 3D was the draw for a lot of people to this film, as the writing and acting suffered the consequences of a cheap thrill ride over one that is involved and intricate.  The film starting in black and white is fine, but that little tiny square?  Come on now...that dragged on way too long and really, the black and white was not done properly at all.  It looked at if the color was just digitally removed and there were not really any plays on dark/light or good use of shadows.  Yeah, the clouds were black, but so what.  The rest was just abysmally gray monotone.  Then you get the color burst (and not too soon) and you're in Oz.

Overall, the story is an interesting adaptation as to how the wizard got to Oz in the first place and how the wicked witch really got that evil.  That said, it reminded me a bit of Darth Vader in how he turned so dark....in that it was whining and crying about petty things and an overreaction that turned a rather mild event into a devastating turn to the overly dark.  Sure...there was a spell, but then one would think that (according to Disney rules) that love would break the spell....and then the Wiz made a lame attempt at reconciliation in that she was welcomed if she found the good....what...no kiss? No ""I'm sorry?""  No ""but you are my queen and I love you"" bit? Really?  I was waiting....per the usual Disney fare that would have been par for the course.

The ending battle, if that's what you can call it, was the best part acting-wise and visually.  A little nod to the man behind the curtain...the Wizard room as to how it got made...that was interesting.  It was worth watching once.....though not everybody with me finished it as the visuals gave them a headache.  I just wish film makers would quit with the 3D and just write a decent script and have some decent actors.  Worth a ride once, but wouldn't pay full price, nor would I want to take another ride once done.",1388102400,2,1934,4.375350140056023

5639703,4,B00BL1BIP8,"When I first heard that Disney was doing a prequel to the Wizard of Oz, I was kind of annoyed. Then I remembered that they did a pretty decent job making a sequel to it, 25 years earlier. My hopes got even higher when I heard that James Franco would star in it. To me, he was such an interesting choice to play the wizard. Franco is a very versatile actor, but he's known more for action and comedy, not family films, but he brings a very interesting dynamic to the movie. Much like the Wizard of Oz and Return To Oz, this film is taken directly from the original Oz stories of L. Frank Baum. Once again, instead of just adapting a book, the screen writers picked and chose from several stories to create this one, and if I may say so, they did a very good job. Of course there is a bunch of Disneyizing to it, as seen with the spunky china girl and the talking monkey, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Franco is terrific and really carries the story. He combines his charms and looks with goofiness and ingenuity to make his character come alive in a way that L. Frank Baum would have loved. He's paired with Mila Kunis who is also really good and used to playing unlikable characters...Shut up Meg! What I especially liked about this film is how they played off the original. Starting in black & white, in an old box format, before opening up to the tradition high def. widescreen view was ingenious. I also loved how people from the black & white story had roles in Oz, just like the original. What was strange though is that they made Oz out to be a real place and discounted the whole dream aspect of the stories. In all of Baum's writings it was never known for a certainty weather or not Oz was a real place. The fact of the matter is that nothing in this genre will ever be as good as the original Wizard of Oz, but The Great & Powerful answers a lot of questions, is taken directly from the writings of the original author, has a great cast, and really does an impressive job of connecting to a film that was made 75 years earlier.",1387324800,,2054,4.2025316455696204

5639722,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I am a great fan of L. Frank Baums book THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ, and I loved the MGM version as well though many
changes were made to the story.  In the book, OZ is a real place, not a dream.  But the marvelous production by MGM was so good
a person cannot quibble over little changes.  Magical, surreal, beautifully filmed and acted, and a wonderful cast as well.  I thought
Bert Larr really stole the film; funny, loveable and yet heroic,  In my opinion this film, now owned by Warner Bros, was MGMs finest
hour (or should I say 2 hours).  Warners even talked about a remake with the original script.  I do not suggest that, but perhaps
added Oz tales from later books could be done.
 This new film is good, well photographed, good special effects and the cast was ok though I thought the witches were rather sexy.
But I only gave it three stars because first it suffers from what all pre-sequels suffer with and that is we already know what is going
to happen in the future.  There are no surprises in this one, though the settings of Oz are quite beautiful.  I know they were trying
to be faithful to the MGM version yet updating  the original with motion pictures new technologies.  That works ok, but I still think
there was not enough originality in the story.  We all know the Wizard was a charlatan (like Patrick Jane?) and then there were
the little Munchkins ready to sing and dance. enough with that!  I do think the film was kind of odd in some ways, but I think for
those who loved the original film and are young at heart, they should get this movie.  Like all my DVDs I get them from AMAZON.
  UPDATE: 7-12-15
  I just watched this film in its entirety on Sci Fi channel: Yes, I have the DVD that I got from Amazon some time back, but I never saw
it in the theater and watched the DVD on my computer that gets a great HD quality pic, but I wanted to see it in full screen HD on a big
set of mine, so I did.  As I have stated before, the quality of the production is superb, colors brilliant much like the original Techicolor 3 strip
process used on the MGM production.  But like many pre-sequels, this film has major flaws.  It is enjoyable though perhaps a bit long with
some dragging scenes, but I think it is worth watching if you are a Baum-a-holic as I was and still am ( I got all his and other authors writings
of OZ including TIN MAN) and the special effects are at times stupendous.  But there is little in the way of surprises; we all know how it will
end.  And some of the  characters are weak, such as Glinda, the good Witch of the South.  And peace never returned to Oz unlike they claim
in this film.  Lots of eye candy, but some goofy moments as to how the Witch of the West became green.  No match for Mrs. Coffee that's
for sure.  Admittedly I do not like the Disney Company, and I mean I DO NOT LIKE them.  I loved Walt but those who took over the company
nearly ran it into the ground.  Remember Isner who tried to pretend he was Disney.  They have turned the corner to the better recently with
fine efforts with ONCE UPON A TIME &  WONDERLAND and the new version of ALICE; we shall see.  Only 3 stars for this mixed bag.",1387065600,,3159,4.1840796019900495

5639757,4,B00BL1BIP8,"I have to be honest, I cant quite understand the vitriol that some people have harboured towards this film.  The idea of making another film in the world of Oz seems at first to be sacriligeous.. and yet as the movie rumbled on past the slightly overlong prologue in real world, I found myself quite enchanted.  For sure, it was more by the spectacle  the colours and definition really pop off the screen in this bluray edition.  But the story works, even if the lines the actors are given can be a bit clunky, and there is a genuine sense of wonder in seeing this world.  Its one of the most satisfying blend of special effects and cgi working seamlessly to make the story work Ive seen in a while.  Talking monkeys have never been so believable.
To give away anything about the plot would be a shame, sufficient to say it is about the origins of the Wizard of Oz, and his confrontation with the wicked witch.  Whats more important is that its a treat to have a movie transport you somewhere, and this movie does that, particularly from the moment the sepia toned opening to the widescreen visually spectacular world of Oz.  In that regard, Sam Raimi was just the man for this job, making a movie that stands on its own merit, with his Raimi touches giving it just the right amount of darkness, and yet with sufficient nods and homages to the original for the observant and imagination in abundance.  If the acting can be theatrical, its because this is a fable not kitchen sink drama.  The cast are more or less up to the task.. Franco is a slightly odd choice for the wizard, but it works, not least because of the support from Rachel Weisz in a fine performance.  Mila Kunis and Michelle Williams do an ok job of keeping up with Weiszs bad witch schtick, but Williams in particular seems to struggle a bit to give her character any dimension..  In short, its the sort of movie that is more likely to tell you about the characters feeling or direction through their makeup and wardrobe than the acting or script.
Nothing is likely to match the hold on peoples hearts the original has, but we could hardly expect a more satisfying blend of spectacle, drama and a little humour than this.  The sugar rush you get from the most lovingly and imaginatively created world zinging off the screen more than compensates for the lack of spice in the chemistry of the leads. (8/10)",1386374400,5,2373,4.4906976744186045
5639758,2,B00BL1BIP8,I expected it to be fresh and exciting  and was considerably let down.  James Franco is seriously over rated. The storyline was weak and unimaginative.,1386288000,,151,5.0
5639759,1,B00BL1BIP8,"When you sit back and think about it, making Oz the Great and Powerful was not only a really risky move, but a rather stupid one.  First of all, The Wizard of Oz is one of the most beloved films OF ALL TIME.  It is probably the most famous, popular and well known film ever made and has legions of fans of all ages.  It is reference possibly more than any other film, quoted more than any other film and immortalized throughout the years in the hearts and in the minds eye of many, many, many people.  Latching yourself to any resemblance of the film is cause for instant and unavoidable scrutiny.  But then you have another factor, the Wicked factor.  While The Wizard of Oz is beloved by film buffs, Wicked is beloved by the theater crowd, and the film buffs have been salivating at the mouth for YEARS waiting for Wicked to come to the big screen.  Cinephiles have pondered who would star in the film, how they could film it, who would get the big musical numbers, and quite frankly we can all agree that the story development in Wicked trumps The Wizard of Oz and so taking it on could result in something unforgettable.

Why on earth would you decide to make an Oz movie and NOT make that movie Wicked?

I was skeptical from the moment I saw James Franco was cast in this, since hes become one of those actors I have no time for anymore.  I love how he started his career as this degrading presence most film lovers tried to avoid only to have his status shift during the 2008-2010 years when he latched onto better directors and for a brief moment we thought we had a real talent on our hands, and now hes turned into this pretentious slab of annoying that we all wish would just go away.

And yes, I thought he was brilliant in Spring Breakers.

With Oz the Great and Powerful, I was ready for a disaster.  I think what makes this particular disaster so upsetting though is that the opening sequence is so magically perfect that I started to get my hopes up.  Sadly, the minute that the film gains color and thrusts us into Oz the film falls apart faster than the tickets sold to Justin Timberlakes last tour.  You could liken this to Burtons disastrous Alice in Wonderland, and the comparison would be obvious and understandable, but Im almost tempted to say that Alice was a better film.  I mean, Alice in Wonderland is already kind of a camp classic and one that lends itself to interpretation.  What Raimi and company do here though is completely desecrate a classic that shouldnt have been so poorly deconstructed.  Its almost offensive how much theyve twisted the original story and stomped all over what could have been perfect.

THIS STORY HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN!  WHY REWRITE IT?!?!

While I can fault it forever for NOT being Wicked, I should try and look at it for what it is, which is the story of the wizard himself.  But really, is it?  I mean, the film seems very uninterested with that particular character, making him nothing more than a self-centered and arrogant idiot who has a strange tinge of redemption in the finale (which felt ripped from Inglourious Basterds) and was made completely forgettable (and nearly loathsome) thanks to Francos ridiculous performance (which was all sorts of perfect theatrics in the opening sequence but lost all manipulative charm once the film actually started).  No, this is really the story of the witches, which is why I fault it for NOT being Wicked.  The main focus here is on a hammy Rachel Weisz, and out of her depth Mila Kunis and a dead behind the eyes Michelle Williams (I love Williams as an actress, but this was Razzy worthy).

This retelling of the story we already know has become a joke, and one that isn't fun to laugh at.

Like Alice in Wonderland before it, this is technically uneven as well.  Many of the special effects and production design elements are admirable and even really, really good and yet so many of them are also so overproduced that they appear inauthentic and ugly.  Emerald City is a dazzling delight, until you walk inside a building and that fake green color coats the walls and looks trashy.  That fog created by Glinda looks like clouds of milk and lets not even get started on the effects used on the Wicked Witch herself.  That transformation was such a mess.

And that brings me to the fact that this film is such a tacky and campy retelling of a story that doesnt need to, nor deserve to be, told in such a manner.

The story told here leaves no place for Ozma, at least not as the book series placed her and her lineage.  There's plenty of room for sequels before Dorothy makes her trip to Oz, and I'm looking forward to them.  I also feel the treatment and explanation for the Wicked Witches (East and West) to be superior to that done in Wicked, a subject that was never really addressed in Baum's books.

When Disney executives saw the finished product of 'Oz the Great and Powerful', a prequel to the erstwhile favorite, 'The Wizard of Oz', do you believe they began moaning at the thought of just how bad everything turned out? Or do you believe they were in denial about the weakness of the script, put on their happy faces, and declared that this was a masterpiece? I believe they weren't concerned with the answers to either of these questions. Disney executives are not stupid. They knew with some halfway decent digital effects and enough references to the 1939 classic, even an extremely mediocre script, would not sink them at the box office. And right they were! The new 'Oz' was a big success and they made gobs of cash.

The new Oz reboot starts out in black and white just like the original. That's where all comparisons end. You can tell right from this opening sequence, that the magic just isn't there. Instead of 'Dorothy' and Judy Garland, we end up with the traveling circus huckster, Oscar 'Oz' Diggs, played by a miscast James Franco. Whereas the original had a compelling story about a cold hearted spinster who, under the guise of legality, expropriates a dog belonging to a heartbroken child, here, the protagonist's flirtation with the wife of a circus strong man, propels the protagonist into the dark, second act, fantasy world. While depicting the wizard as a womanizer may not kill sympathy for the character, the way in which Oz treats his subordinate, certainly does. Instead of a charming rake, Franco's 'Oz' is both part bumbler and arrogant materialist.

Oscar's entrance into the world of Oz, incorporates the vehicle of the hot air balloon, so prominent in the denouement of the original. Here, in one of the many nods to the original Oz, Oscar is sucked into a tornado and ends up in a new 'Technicolor' universe. But it's way more than just the Technicolor of the original--director Rami's 'Oz' is an art deco wonderland, reminiscent of the digital effects in 'Avatar', featuring giant flowers and butterflies. Instead of a house landing on a wicked witch, Oscar's hot air balloon cascades down a waterfall, with Oscar miraculously surviving a near fatal plunge.

While the digital effects are pleasing to the eye, once we meet the first character in the Land of Oz, everything is downhill from there. In the original film, Glinda the Good Witch was pitted against her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West. In this version, there are three witches: Theodora (Mila Kunis), her evil sister, Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda the Good Witch, played by Michelle Williams. At the beginning of the second Act, Kunis walks around with Franco with a completely clueless look on her face, as if she has no idea how to play the character. Feminists are sure to be appalled, as both Theodora and Glinda are doe-eyed for Oscar throughout the narrative (Theodora mistaking him for a wizard and Glinda admitting that she knows he's not the Wizard, but still can help defeat the Wicked Witch).

Only later, when Evanora convinces her to take a bite of an apple, does Kunis morph into the more familiar evil, green-skinned wicked witch, and camps things up the rest of the way, battling Oscar and his minions (Weisz probably does the best acting of the three witches but her Evanora, is an unmemorable, undistinguished part). It might have been a better idea if Theodora and Evanora, were one character. Williams as Glinda is one-note throughout the film, echoing Theodora's earlier hero worship.

In place of the dynamic sidekicks, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion, Oscar must be content with two allies who miss the mark: Finley, a witless flying monkey and the China Girl, a porcelain figure who Oscar mends with a bottle of glue. Oscar's act of kindness in healing the China Girl, might be good for young kids but the 'glue' scene goes on interminably too long for adults. The porcelain girl bonds with Oscar on a childlike level and ends up helping Glinda free herself from the bad witches, after she's captured and put in chains in Emerald City. Glinda in turn, neutralizes Evanora, by destroying her emerald necklace, and reducing her to an old crone.

Unlike the original, where the Scarecrow, Lion and Tin Man, courageously attempt to save Dorothy by entering the Wicked Witch's lair and actually killing her, we now have the politically correct solution: Oscar assists the pacifist denizens of Oz, who don't believe in violence, by concocting a series of 'sleight of hand' magic tricks, to take back Emerald City (with an approaching World War, the 1939 scenarists apparently refused to view the world with rose-colored glasses). Evanora's army of flying baboons, are tricked into entering the poppy seed field where they fall asleep after being lured by mechanical scarecrows, constructed by Oz craftsmen (another nod in the long line of nods to the classic Oz). The powerful Theodora, proves not to be powerful at all--fleeing the city after being freaked out by Oscar's holographic projection of himself as a malevolent and powerful wizard.

Oscar's transformation from arrogant con man to humanitarian, is not explained very well. What's worse is the unconvincing way in which he defeats the two seemingly powerful wicked witches (they just can't seem to realize that there's no true force behind his bag of magic tricks). In the end, we never become invested in Oscar's journey as we are in Dorothy's. When Dorothy exclaims, ""I'm scared, Auntie Em, I'm scared"", we believe it! That's because the personification of the evil she faces (in the form of the Wicked Witch) appears real. Not so for Disney's two ineffectual wicked witches and the syrupy, sentimental allies, who assist Oscar, in his quest to restore the land of Oz, to a rightful, balanced equilibrium.",1383955200,5,5833,4.9147208121827415

it is a trip!  Those of us fortunate to have 7.1 sound get a

it is definitely cut from different cloth.  Great movie!",1383868800,,247,4.212765957446808

5639876,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Not often does a film, a reimagining, a prequel or a variation of a beloved classic actually come together and work.

Disney's Oz The Great and Powerful is just such a film. Not a small feat considering the HUGE shoes it's trying to fill. The Wizard of Oz is one of the most well known and beloved films of all time.

The story of how Oz came to be as we've know him all our lives is both a loving tribute to the original, but a refreshingly new take of the classic giving us all we could ask for, a new look at this magical land and a story that pleasingly fills in gaps in the original and breathes new life into the story.

The cast is pretty much perfect blending together new and old. Franco playing the title character as a fast talking con artist/magician a charlatan/shyster of sorts is well suited for the role and by the end of the film I was cheering him on. Kunis, Weisz and Williams play the three witches with both nods to the original characters and offering us some new insight on what they may have been like in their younger days.

I loved the way the film starts in full screen sepia tone and then goes to color like the original of course now the color sequence turns the film to grand widescreen presentation only making the change all the more dramatic. I'm a fan of the original(who isn't?) , but I must say this film will sit right along side of it and I may visit this prequel more often than the original ..especially since I've seen the original countless times.

I haven't seen the 3D version and wish now that I had gone to the theater to see it. The Blu Ray looks fabulous and the detail to the land of Oz looks breathtaking. The China Doll from China Town is a stand out as one of the characters from a place in the book that didn't make the original movie. I can't see how any fan of the original wouldn't like this film, it offers what all remakes or continuations of films should offer something new without taking away anything from the original!

My only gripe and reason for not giving this a 5 star rating is that the video release is filled with greed. To offer the DVD, Blu Ray and 3D Blu Ray on separate releases only is just ridiculous! If you want to recoup some sales in the home theater market then give consumers a reason to buy it! Put all three versions in one package...how much do blank discs cost anyway??? Very cheap trick Disney! ..but you're not fooling anyone!",1383782400,,2415,4.285087719298246
5639877,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Wonderful tale to start one of the most classic stories of American movie history. The actors/actresses picked to portray these characters were perfect to a tee (including Franco, who seems a bit ""prickly"" in real life and seems to have to confront that attitude as a younger Oz who is tasked with great challenges throughout the film.) This movie has one key element that makes movies great; replay value. Myself, wife, and even our daughter who will be 3 in Jan. love to watch this movie whenever one of us suggests it. The humor and vibrant colors are perfect for children of all ages.

If you like the new live action Alice in Wonderland, or anyother live action Disney movie of the last decade for that matter, you will enjoy Oz as well.",1383696000,,742,4.578947368421052

5639880,4,B00BL1BIP8,"This actually turned out better than I expected, but with only five stars to choose from, I had to go with four. It is actually closer to 3.75 as a rating goes, mostly because of the pacing. The story doesn't move particularly fast, but the performances are pretty good. Like the original Wizard of Oz, the story starts out on the small screen and monochrome. Then, once Oz landed in the land of Oz, it expanded out and became very colorful.

However, that's a tired mechanism and really didn't add to the enjoyment factor. There wasn't any kind of wow factor to the film, so it barely (rounded up) made it to four stars.",1383696000,,621,4.447368421052632

5639908,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Pay no attention to those people behind the curtain claiming that this film does an injustice to the work of L. Frank Baum.  They are of no consequence.

Great stories often tell of a personal transformation, and I loved the transition from Oz the scoundrel to Oz the leader.  Franco played the scoundrel Oz quite well, I thought, and I believed he was still the scoundrel right up to the point that he proved he wasn't.

I went into this movie with a great sense of trepidation caused by a legion of bad reviews, and one again I loved a thoroughly panned film.  I was able to sit through the entire sequence twice (once in 2D and once again in 3D) without once trying to figure out why this take on Baum's Oz was less effective than the 1939 one, which I also love dearly.  I did, however, greatly enjoy identifying the connections between this obvious prequel and the 1939 classic.

If you can go into this feature without preconceived notions of Oz that you insist it live up to, you may have an enjoyable experience, as I did.",1383177600,,1030,4.417989417989418

5639942,4,B00BL1BIP8,"This is a review intended for fans of the Oz books. There are plenty of reviews for everyone else but I can't find any geared towards book fans.
First of all, I do like this movie and bought it. I've seen it multiple times and think the effects are wonderful, especially with China Girl. Though I'm complaining a lot, that comes from the Oz fan boy in me and as you see I gave the movie four stars. (Since it's a good film, just not a great one.)

Is it worth watching? I'd say yes.
Is it everything an Oz fan could want? Hardly.
It's obvious from the start that the director and the others involved do NOT know Oz, and even if they did read a few Oz books here and there, they certainly didn't let the magic from Baum's stories carry over. In fact, I believe Sam Raimi said he didn't read the books until he was finished with the movie.
James Franco claims to have read the books since he was a kid, and maybe he did, he did a pretty good job and I can see his version of Oz growing up into the Oscar Diggs in the books.
The others not so much.
Glinda fell flat, though her actress did a good job with what was given her and though I think the Wicked Witches did a fine job at acting, I can't imagine the Wicked Witch of the West becoming the book's witch.
And that's the main problem with this new franchise Disney is working at.
They are leaning so heavily on the imagery and characters from the MGM musical I think they are seriously handicapping themselves for future Oz movies (which were pretty much confirmed).
As anyone who's read the books knows, the Wicked Witch of the West is not all that important, she's never described as green, doesn't seem able to fly and actually just seems like a very mean spirited old woman with some dirty magic tricks.
The one portrayed in Disney's film is supposed to be a younger version of Margaret Hamilton's witch, no question about it! She flies on a broomstick that leaves a trail behind her, has green skin, a black witchy costume and that cackle. I was so expecting her to do sky writing that I was surprised she didn't!
You see, WB holds the copyright to most of those things when it comes to Oz, as well as the famous Ruby Slippers, so Disney had to tread carefully...though they came close.
Giant Winkies? Check. Mini Munchkins? Check. Poppies growing right outside EC? Check. Horse of a different color and Glinda bubbles? check and check.
You see, those were all things not in the books and only seen in the MGM musical, which is why I believe Disney is ruining any further movies since they can't keep going this way and still claim it's original.

What was like the books:

As for fans of the books, there are a few nods to us included,
1. There is a map drawn by Professor Wogglebug (would he have even been alive during this time?) that shows Oz is divided into four countries like in the books...though they put the Munchkin's in the west and the Winkies in the East (explicitly shown on the compass rose).
This caused some major issues.
(Mainly the fact that when Dorothy arrives she lands on the Witch of the East...who in Disney's version will be living in the West and the WWW will be living in the East...)
2. The Wizard's full name is given as Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, like in the books,
3. Glinda is FINALLY stated to be the Witch of the South, just as she is in the books, and she is referred to as Glinda the Good.
4. There is the Dainty China Country, here called the China Town. (Though it's in the Munchkin Country instead of the Quadling Country.)
5. There were people called the Tinkers, which I suppose were a nod to Mr. Tinker.
6. If you look really closely you can see Baum's face on the coins in Emerald City and the circus the Wizard works at is ""Baum Bros.""
7. There are green tinted glasses shown near the end.

What was not like the books at all:

1. There is no reference made to Ozma or Mombi, or the Good Witch of the North, all of whom should be present I believe in this time line.
2. Instead, Glinda is the King of Oz's daughter. His name is not given as Pastoria and he was a Wizard.
3. Instead of being from Nebraska the Wizard is said to be a Kansas Man.
4. There is no color theme for each country present...While much of the movie is spent with Glinda in the Quadling Country everything seems more yellow and pastel shades than red (though the flowers seem predominantly red there)
5. The movie takes place in 1905...which is strange since the Wizard of Oz was written in 1899 and published a year later. By the time Dorothy arrived in Oz the Wizard had grown very old.
I guess that's another attempt to link it with MGM's movie.
6. Glinda is blonde...why was that even necessary?

What was obviously borrowed from the famous MGM movie:
1. Singing, very short Munchkins.
2. Evil red powder (like in the hour glass)
3. Horses of a Different Color
4. Glinda travels by bubble and acts a bit ditzy (probably in reference to Wicked's Galinda)
5. The strange costumes based on the MGM movie worn by the Munchkins and even the Quadlings.
6. Glinda seems to have a double in Kansas and China Girl and Finley are obvious references to people from Kansas too.

Other problems not reconcilable with either the books or the movie are there too. The poppy field is shown to be on the eastern side of the Emerald City, which would be fine if the Munchkins were in the East as they are in the books and the MGM movie. (They are so close to the city I wonder how they are not considered a hazard.)
Dorothy arrives from the eastern side in both versions, though the poppies are no where near the Emerald City in the book.

I enjoyed the movie, but it really slows down about half way in and it gets really boring before picking back up to a grand conclusion that I did have fun watching!
I honestly hope Disney makes more sequels as has been confirmed by the actresses, but I really hope they find their own identity and give us the real Oz fans of the books have been longing for.
I don't mind a twist and some Disney originality, but they need to stop being copycats. This just didn't feel like a Disney film to me.",1382313600,,6139,4.322916666666667

5639956,5,B00BL1BIP8,Great movie to show how OZ got to the Land of Oz.  Great new characters and it does lead up to how the Witches became who they were.  The only part I would complain about the movie is that there isn't any chemistry between Franco and Williams to make you believe they love each other.

5639961,1,B00BL1BIP8,"Despite all the criticism this movie received, having the name Oz and remembering what a great movie the original with Judy Garland was, I went ahead and purchased this film. Franco, Braff, Kunis, and Weisz were all actors whose performances I anticipated to be great. Their work in the series Spider-Man, Scrubs, Family Guy, and The Mummy convinced me this film would be one worth watching. Much to my disappointment, the opposite was true.

From the very beginning, Franco seemed like he was on some sort of low budget independent film and on the way to beginning his abysmal and short acting career. I could not understand it. The same went with Kunis. Every time they spoke, I was always puzzled with what exactly was going on. Kunis did horribly. What was supposed to be her sinister, wicked voice was amateur at best. The CGI and special effects were not even great. If you were perhaps still a child, then maybe there was hope that you would be able to enjoy this movie.  There were noticeable flaws in the animation. I wondered throughout the movie if there really was no one else who auditioned for the parts. Did none of the budget go towards properly casting this film? The writing wasn't that great, either. Much of it was predictable despite not following the storyline of the original. Disney should not have his name attached to this.

This movie is one of the worst movies I have watched, and I've watched Glitter. I think that movie was much better than this.",1382054400,,1476,4.6692307692307695

5639964,1,B00BL1BIP8,"You cannot even compare this movie to the original, which is my all time favorite. This movie doesn't deserve any part of the original title",1381795200,,140,4.64
5639965,3,B00BL1BIP8,"This movie has lots of good points, but when the lead actor just doesn't fit the role, it's difficult to call it a 5 star film.  I've seen James Franco in many films, and he is a good actor.  In ""Oz"", he appears to be trying too hard and not making it.  Mila Kunis is fantastic as the witch, Theodora!  She brings so much personality to her role.  Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams are also extremely good in their roles as witches.  This movie is a prequel to The Wizard of Oz and answers a lot of questions from that film.  Oz is a con artist from a carnival who is fleeing from the boyfriend or husband of one of the many women he has been wooing.  He leaves his black and white land in a hot air balloon and gets caught up in a tornado and flung to a land far, far away.  He lands in a colorful land and meets Theodora who is beautiful, sweet and sensitive.  She falls for his womanizing ways and thinks she is in love with him.  NO SPOILERS FROM ME!  I will say that the CGI in many places was pretty bad (such as backgrounds, for example).  It is an interesting story but takes a while to get to the good part...the original movie didn't have that problem.  I definitely recommend renting it, but I wouldn't buy it.",1381708800,,1222,4.14468085106383

5639977,1,B00BL1BIP8,Blu-Ray does not default to English as a language so you have to choose it.  Also it defaults to 2.0 audio instead of 5.1 or 7.1.  So you have to go back to the menu screen and choose your audio in the settings.  And if you stop the blu-ray and come back to it.  You get to jump through all those hoops all over again.

5639981,1,B00BL1BIP8,"Recently the once-imaginative Disney studios have been churning out big-budget eye candy, devoid of any original plotting, interesting characters, or compelling dialogue.  ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""John Carter"", ""The Lone Ranger"", the list goes on and on.  Millions are spent on bright colors, hyperkinetic camera moves, and gaudy CGI, with apparently no thought given to narrative drive or character development (do the writers and directors of this garbage not ""get it"" or do they simply not care?).  This ""Oz..."" story is just another in the seemingly endless series of garish, empty movies with no heart and no ""head"" (intelligent, thoughtful construction).

With such a disastrous script and so unimaginative an approach, it's no wonder that the acting is wooden at best (Weisz, Franco) and dreadful at worst (Mila Kunis, whose acting skills seem to have deteriorated from ""That 70s Show"").

I'm a fan of most things Oz - from the Baum books, to the Thompson (and others) sequels, and the legendary 1939 film; even Gregory McGuire's books (""Wicked"", et al) showed some imaginative flair and nicely-crafted writing.  All had their distinctive appeal.  This monstrosity adds nothing to the long line of imaginative ""Oziana"", and it's only value is to re-enforce how completely bereft of creativity the Disney studios have become.  Avoid at all costs.",1381536000,5,1351,5.309859154929577

Unlike Disney's Return to Oz, which made a few mistakes along the yellow brick road, Oz the Great & Powerful stands out with successful ideas of original story telling that work.  Everyone in the cast gave great performances.  Michelle Williams was the perfect Glinda--even better than Billie Burke's version.  James Franco was very believable as Oscar Diggs and had just the right amount of charisma to pull off the part of a younger Wizard.  There's no denying that nobody can top Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Even so, Mila Kunis did a remarkable job of trying.  This is a movie that deserves to be called a classic.  It's too bad it wasn't a musical like the Disney M-G-M version.  But musicals are a dying breed--except for animated films.  The bottom line is that Oz the Great & Powerful deserves a lot more credit than some have given it.",1381276800,,944,4.565476190476191

This tale comes from a cute idea, telling the tale of how the Wizard came to Oz in the first place, but it goes against many of the facts stated in the books and re-casts characters dramatically, making it far less compelling and hard to take seriously.  It might have worked if the plot and dialogue had been better, but alas, they weren't.  Basically it became a tale of a ne'er-do-well charlatan who finds his true purpose defending a land and a pretty princess from wicked witches.  Sappy.  And a lot of things left unexplained, like at the end, it seems like the Wizard is saying goodbye like he's going back to Kansas, but he's not, is he?  Confusing.  And if he's going to rule as the Wizard, what's going to happen to Glinda, who got made into the princess for some reason when everyone who knows Oz knows that the princess was Ozma and the Wizard conspired to hide her so that he could rule.

It's gorgeous to look at, and the story turns out to be a pretty clever take off on the story we all know so well.

James Franco - He does well enough in the lead role, but I did keep wishing Oz was at least something like the character so well known from the 1930's film.  There's virtually no relationship between the two, mostly due to the casting of Franco.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Sam Raimi's epic fantasy prequel conjures up a new benchmark for 3D Blu-ray. Given the reverence so many fans have for the legendary 1939 M-G-M musical, it's no surprise that some consider any plans to do a prequel to The Wizard of Oz to be completely sacrilegious.

But somehow writer David Lindsay-Abaire and Michael Kapner and director Sam Raimi have managed to magic up a dizzying and manically inventive fantasy film that feels like a natural part of the universe Frank L. Baum created. By exploring the origin of the Wizard, this blockbuster prequel feels fresh and unpredictable, whilst also delivering plenty of nods and winks for fans of the original film, especially the Frank L. Baum's books.

More delightful is the film's 3D presentation, which actually makes for a very entertaining experience. Though built on the backs of endless 3D gimmicks, there's a delirious energy to all the carnivorous plants, dive-bombing monkeys, surging rapids, toothy river fairies, jutting emerald crystals, and billowing fireballs to thoroughly demonstrate Sam Raimi's penchant for 3D showmanship. The camera leaps and swoops, glides and falls; the creatures of Oz charge and lunge, pounce and attack; cities and towns loom and extend into the distance, while endless fields of flowers, dark forests and sprawling mountain ranges disappear into the horizon. What Oz the Great and Powerful lacks in cohesion and inspiration, it tacks on with feverish, sometimes dizzying 3D, and it's clear that Sam Raimi's Oz was built to take full advantage of the format, from the ground up. The added assault on the senses even distracts from some of the film's bigger problems, making its 2D counterpart feel even flatter and less whimsical. Is the 3D version of the film the wonderful wizard Disney and the filmmakers hoped it would be? Perhaps in part, but it still falls short. It may take a sequel to prove Sam Raimi and company truly have something up their sleeves.

Buoyed by game performances from all the principals and Sam Raimi's energetic direction, Oz the Great and Powerful is a fun slice of fantastical whimsy wrapped up in dazzling layers of 3D eye-candy. So, even if it doesn't really measure up to the original, it's still a whole lot of magical and exciting fun.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Step aside AVATAR there is a new king of 3D Blu-ray. Disney's stunning awesome encoded stereoscopic presentation of Oz the Great and Powerful 3D not only sets a new technical benchmark for the format  the native 3D photography is so involving that it easily makes the film more enjoyable that the 'flat' version. The sheer depth of the image and the volume dimensions of everything is frankly totally awe-inspiring. Nothing about it feels forced, it just feels perfectly natural. Colour presentation is probably the most vibrant I have seen in a 3D presentation and fills the widescreen 2.40:1 at all times, at least it does from Chapter 8 when the action moves to Oz, prior to that it's 1.33:1 black-and-white. Oz the Great and Powerful 3D 1080p imagery is truly magical.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 3D presentations of the film are accompanied by what Disney is openly touting as a 'near-field' 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. This indicates that the mix has been optimised for 'smaller' environments  but don't worry, this is something that Disney has apparently done with a lot of its mixes in the past, albeit without the labelling and, as it happens, Oz the Great and Powerful 7.1 channel soundtrack is a match for the reference-quality visuals. Admittedly, things start in a rather subdued mode, with the audio accompanying the monochrome opening being deliberately wedded to the front stereo spread. However, once our hero is sucked up by the tornado in Chapter 7 the full 7.1 mix explodes into life. Front and rear speakers are employed aggressively and consistently from that point onwards, building layer upon layer of audio in the sound field to dynamic effect.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The 3D version contains no supplements whatsoever on the Blu-ray disc itself. Supplements can only can be accessed through the Digital Copy Plus version of the film.

Special Feature: Walt Disney and the Road to Oz [Digital Copy Plus] [10:00] The studio and Uncle Walt's history with Oz, which traces back to the 1930s (when Snow White hinted at the success of feature fantasy), Disney's acquisition of the rights to fourteen Oz books, an abandoned 1950s musical adaptation (The Rainbow Road to Oz), and other milestones on the long and winding road to Oz the Great and Powerful.

Special Feature: My Journey in Oz, by James Franco [Digital Copy Plus] [22:00] This sort of a-day-in-the-life video journal is more of a James Franco-hosted production documentary than anything else, and that's perfectly fine. James Franco does everything from discussing the film to interviewing Sam Raimi to going behind-the-scenes to reveal how practical and visual effects were used to realise Oz.

Special Feature: China Girl and the Suspension of Disbelief [Digital Copy Plus] [5:00] Oz's porcelain doll springs to life by way of on-set marionettes, computer wizardry and the voice performance of young actress Joey King.

Special Feature: Before Your Very Eyes: From Kansas to Oz [Digital Copy Plus] [11:00] The design, development and creation of the lands of Oz the Great and Powerful, from the film's visual aesthetic to its costumes, sets, environments, locations and grand vistas.

Special Feature: Metamorphosis [Digital Copy Plus] [8:00] Sam Raimi and company bring the Wicked Witch to sinister, cackling life with prosthetics that simultaneously accentuate, sharpen and mask the actress's facial features.

Special Feature: Mr. Elfman's Musical Concoctions [Digital Copy Plus] [7:00] Composer Danny Elfman and the film's score.

Special Feature: Bloopers [Digital Copy Plus] [5:00] Franco, Braff, Kunis and the rest of the cast ham it up.

Finally, Oz the Great and Powerful 3D never ascends to the heights of the original The Wizard of Oz, and unfortunately a lot of critics of this 3D Blu-ray say that is certainly won't ever be hailed as a timeless classic, but to me it is a beautiful modern day classic of the original masterpiece in cinema history. So it will be totally wrong to give this 2013 film comparison, is almost totally unfair, but sadly a lot of critics are all unfairly in precisely doing that comparison, which is totally out of order and makes me very angry and totally incensed, as it is a totally beautiful well-crafted film and especially in 3D, whereas the 2D looks totally flat, that is a must to view in 3D. Another thing that is making me so angry is the comments of critics of this marvellous film, saying that nothing quite clicks into place [rubbish] especially the script, the cast, the visual effects, which to my mind is a very harsh comment and have obviously been watching a different film to me. On top of all that I feel Sam Raimi eventually finds his footing with Oz the Great and Powerful 3D and hits a decent stride and finishes poised hopefully, for a sequel. The 3D version is even better and is a honestly a very exciting experience. Walt Disney's Blu-ray release is more consistent and satisfying experience of this film, and with an excellent video transfer, especially the terrific sumptuous 3D experience, and a very exciting strong 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track. The 3D edition's extras are only available by way of Disney's new Digital Copy Plus online service, so that's a rather irritating hassle, but at least the content is still available in one way or another. All told, Oz the Great and Powerful 3D is a great and powerful prequel it could be, but its the Blu-ray debut and 3D AV awesome presentation, unite to become a formidable powerhouse. Very Highly Recommended!

I was a bit upset in the beginning when the movie was black an white (which I expected as it was in the original), but mostly I was pissed at the screen size (3:4 format). But when Oz makes it out of the storm and everything turns color, the screen slowly widens.

Slow start to the movie but it picks up pace and turns out to be pretty entertaining. Some sketchy acting here and there and you have to do a little thinking to connect the director's interpretation of the connections to Wicked and The original Oz, but overall at the end, it was a cool movie to watch and visually entertaining.",1380412800,6,648,4.311475409836065

If you just accept as a given that no movie will ever be able to recreate the magic of a beloved classic like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" then you can have a pretty good time with ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" a lavish, visually dazzling prequel to both the 1939 movie and the L. Frank Baum novels that inspired it.

The movie, with screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire and direction by Sam Raimi, tells us what happened long before young Dorothy Gale from Kansas skipped along the Yellow Brick Road with her three companions - the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion - and her little dog Toto in tow. It shows how a second-rate carnival magician - a self-described con man and humbug - is carried away by a tornado from a black-and-white, turn-of-the-20th Century Kansas (a clear homage to the original film) to a magical, multi-colored land that just happens to bear his name, Oz (short for Oscar). There he encounters an assortment of strange, funny-looking people and creatures, along with three witches, one of whom, Glinda (Michelle Williams), is good, while the other two, sisters in fact (Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz), are evil. Oz also learns that the inhabitants of the land have been faithfully awaiting the arrival of a messianic ""wizard,"" whom it is prophesied, will free them all from bondage to the wicked witches. The movie not only shows how the wizard ultimately becomes the wizard but how the Wicked Witch of the West ultimately becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.

In many ways, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is really just a rehash of the original story, only with the magician in the role of Dorothy this time around. And while the movie could definitely use some trimming from its overlong 130-minute running time, it's worth seeing for its dazzling re-creation of the land of Oz alone. Its visual schema remains faithful to the original, matching the colors, costumes and art direction almost to perfection, and it is, of course, enhanced by all the marvels that modern CGI technology can provide. And as with the original, this new ""Oz"" has some of the actors doing double duty, appearing in both the black-and-white and color sequences in the film, and it nicely re-creates a number of key scenes from ""The Wizard of Oz."" In fact, the best thing to be said for this version is that its makers clearly revere the original as much as the rest of us do and they are careful not to violate either its look or its spirit.

In the final analysis, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" clearly lacks the emotional resonance, brilliant characterizations, great score, and enduring themes of the original (that would be a pretty tall order for any filmmakers to fulfill), but Franco makes such a disarming wizard and the whole thing looks just so darn spectacular that you may not mind so much that it doesn't achieve the impossible.",1379980800,,2863,4.731462925851703
5640072,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Really great movie. Visually stunning and had an awesome story line. Was cast quite well, i wasn't so sure about James Franco since the wizard was an old man. Wanted more references to the original, or more similar characters. Still good though, and worth it.",1379980800,,259,4.777777777777778
5640073,5,B00BL1BIP8,This is one of my favorite movies. James Franco was awesome. Very colorful movie and a nice lead up to the Wizard of Oz,1379980800,,119,4.0

5640075,4,B00BL1BIP8,"james franco slips up a few times in very subtle ways, so not much affect over all. the witch is totally not believable or scary (unless maybe one of her fireballs was streaking towards you for real) but over all it is a good movie and fun to watch",1379894400,,248,4.081632653061225

5640090,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Though the casting was really well done, the characters themselves left you empty. The wizard did not want to be a good guy, and never actually became one.

5640091,4,B00BL1BIP8,I liked what they did and did not do a redo of the original. I did not know that when i sat down to watch it. the other thing i really liked is that it was okay for the kids.  There is one marginally scary part when the monkeys fly in to attack but really it shows their scary face for MAYBE 5 seconds. Great family movie!,1379721600,,322,3.8059701492537314
5640092,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I love James Franco in a ""I want to be friends with him"" kind of way, but he was totally wrong for this movie. I didn't have high expectations for this movie, having heard all the terrible reviews before we watched it, so I wasn't expecting much. Like every other child of America, I grew up loving the Wizard of Oz. I'm not sure if the people who made this movie thought they wanted to change the dynamic of cinema forever like the original did, but I'm hoping they at least made it with good intentions. Whatever the case, they didn't quite hit the mark. It almost felt like they made a mockery of Oz, going beyond the dream world to a world of ridiculousness. I think kids will like this movie but as an adult who initially (before I heard the reviews after it came out) wanted to be able to experience the awesomeness that Wizard of Oz made me feel as a kid, instead I shook my head and sighed with disappointment.",1379721600,,918,4.281609195402299
5640093,3,B00BL1BIP8,Overall worth a watch but not a buy. Good special effects and James Franco was excellent but Milan Kunis was very difficult to watch as the movie progressed.,1379721600,2,157,4.642857142857143

5640122,4,B00BL1BIP8,With this  cast and director I really expected more. THe move is GORGEOUS but the story line tries to take on too much in too little time. Some of the reasoning and actions feel stretched and I love fantasy and am always forgiving.,1379548800,,231,4.372093023255814

The screenplay hit on most of the basic plot points, and offers an almost reasonable explanation of how the wizard got to Oz in the first place. What more could we ask? Well, maybe a bit more plot, some character development, and perhaps some more effective humor wouldn't have been out of place.
For the most part, it's an attractive film, fairly watchable, but the actors mostly tend to walk through it without offering much. I will say  that although I'm not especially a Mila Kunis fan, she brought more to her role than anyone else did to theirs; I'm thinking she practiced her cackle for hours...",1379462400,,714,4.622047244094488

Is it worth a view in 2D? Yes. However, it will seem a little over-long. The actors are fine, the story is fine, the visual effects are very good (but will seem ""over done""). One of the best sequences are the singing munchkins, which is cut off mid-song as a joke. Makes me think this movie would have been better served as an all-out musical...

As a James Franco fan, I really wanted to like the character he played, it just couldn't be so. His character is entirely unrelateable and dislikeable.

How could these two legendary movies ever compete. it was simply impossible and the likes will never happen again and still to this day they are two of the most cherished movies in history and will be for countless generations to come.. One for a heartbreaking kiss & walking out the door in the fog and rain & one for both children and adults alike to prove there is no limits to the imagination and incredible story telling taking viewers over the rainbow...... Which brings up to the age where  a studio would even dare to take on and  try to make a prequel to one of most beloved stories of all time... So now here is the OZ Great and powerful... does it is completely hit the mark...no.. but could any attempt really accomplish that?? yes there were parts what were a bit cheesy. But the Land of OZ is so very complicated on many different levels. First there was the story of the sisters in Oz and A con man who really tried to save the day. There was a really nice story line and the morals behind it truly could be felt. Oz did try to do well by Masterpiece but it did fall a bit short. The premise was certainly intriguing and certain things were incredibly sad on how things in OZ came to be...The story did try to send out a great message to all.. that acting was decent... the effects were over way done yet beautiful to behold... Yes this is a takeoff on Wicked and its gives a decent background in the land of OZ and how the ""true"" wicked witch came to be.. but will never ever be surpassed by the legendary performance of Margaret Hamilton. OZ was way over computerized with effects but it did try = way to hard. Did it have the best story line ..no.. but when you watch this film you cant help but smile in certain areas of this film. It tried to hard. But then again how in the hell can some one even try to top a movie in 1931 that set the standard for almost every movie that followed. OZ is a fun movie as times, and surprising on how the wicked became wicked but really didn't go far enough to justify how that all came about.. maybe this should have been broken up in to two movies because there is so much wealth of material and stories to tell and what was left out or didn't tie in to the classic...Oz tried do do right by the original but it tried way to hard and yet still didn't have enough time to tell the whole story. For fans of the story OZ will disappoint and excite at the same time... what could have been and should of. But in no means is this truly a bad film. It falls in the middle. Any one who loved the Wizard of OZ should see this. Will if fill all their expectations and tie everything in ...NO.. but the story as it tried to tell in a single movie is a decent tribute and an intriguing prequel to a masterpiece that was written and made in to a legendary, standard setting film before most of us were even born...  OZ is Worth renting or owning, there are some fine tributes and story lines to try to tie it in but in no way does it touch the classic. Yes  get the original for it is timeless. and deserves to be in every household for it touches the young old  a like and will never stop bringing viewers somewhere over the rainbow. OZ the great and powerful is a hit and miss at the same time but certainly deserves a viewing to those who wonder  and love the original and gives a tantalizing back drop of the land called OZ but could have been so much more.",1379116800,,3708,4.154596100278551

5640177,1,B00BL1BIP8,"I like Franco. I love happy ending movies. But I did not like this movie because:

1-Horrible CGI -They just got so lazy in this movie it was amazing this made it out to the theaters.

2-There was nothing likeable about the main character Oz. Not even when he ""redeemed"" himself.

3-They made the main character a womanizer.

4-The acting was pretty bad. They acted  and dressed like it was 2013 in contemporary U.S. Not another world, another time. This was a prequel right?

5-The monkey bell hop was creepy through the whole movie. I kept waiting for him to turn on Oz and he never did so I was disappointed.

BUT I have to say in one area they excelled and I loved was the little porcelain doll. Her character was spunky and cute and she was animated/rendered beautifully. That is what the one star is for the doll alone, otherwise this movie would have double goose eggs from me.",1379030400,6,884,4.453416149068323

You all have become so jaded, I guess, to the point of being overly critical. This movie held our interest, and wasn't predictable at all. Costumes, effects, and acting were all just perfect.

5640250,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Another reviewer said the China doll was the most interesting, empathetic character in this movie. I thought he was joking. Turns out, the reviewer was dead on. The China doll character is well animated and emotes more than the other characters combined.

The acting of the other characters brings this movie down. Unfortunately, I think a lot of the roles were miscast. For the Oz character, the movie really needed somebody with a lot of energy and confidence like Jack Black or Johnny Depp. James Franco just comes across as awkward. The witches aren't fully convincing, often coming across as bickering teens rather than larger-than-life characters.

This is also yet another movie where the CGI tends to hurt rather than harm the film. On its own, the CGI looks beautiful, but whenever a human is in the frame it only reinforces how fake it all seems. I could never actually believe that the humans were actually in Oz as opposed to in front of a green screen.

This isn't a horrible movie. The depiction of Oz is more wonderful than what we got with the original movie, so CGI worked in that respect. However, the problems with the acting and merging live actors with CGI makes me think any return to Oz should be a fully animated film rather than live action. Overall, 3.5 stars.",1378425600,9,1286,4.706666666666667

I can stream netflix all day in HD but amazon's app cant even make a clear picture. Lets face it, we didn't watch OZ for the superior plot, we watched it for the visuals.

5640293,4,B00BL1BIP8,"First, I need to say that I have loved Garland's Oz, and loving Wicked- well-this is the base from which I review this. I like the actor james franco. But not as Oz. He didn't seem to quite pull it off. It was as though he was doing an ""impression"" of Oz and not quite succeeding. It felt contrived. Also-owning all of the Wicked books and knowing the geography-the characters and their placements were-here's where I stop. A long time ago-when Jurassic Park movie came out-people who had read the book cried foul. Those like me-who read the book after-enjoyed it on its face value. I think that is the case here. If you have not read the wicked series-or don't have any feelings about Garland's Oz-then you will probably enjoy this interpretation. For the rest-you might find yourself as I did-picking it apart. i didn't not like it-but I can't help but wonder how marvelous it would have been if they could have incorporated some of the Wicked elements.",1378252800,,955,4.623529411764705
5640294,2,B00BL1BIP8,"I would rate it one star but it feels like that would be a disservice to say that I hate it.  I will simply say that what could have been an excellent re-imagining of the original ended up falling victim to pacing problems and character issues.  I'm a huge fan of Zach Braff, James Franco, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz.  It feels like the entire production seemed to want to force the story rather than let it develop on its own and the actors were forced to work with it, which didn't end well.  Zach Braff usually does some good comedy but here it felt very out of place with the rest of the events and James Franco unfortunately also felt very out of place.  Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz seemed well placed and their performances were alright, but with the disjointed production it didn't help alot.  Overall I wish the movie had been better as I had high hopes with the cast but was ultimately let down.",1378252800,,905,4.357142857142857

Well, I'm happy to say that the BluRay version is wonderful; all the color, sound and beauty of the original.  I don't miss any of the 3D effects at all because the cinematography and CGI in this film are top notch.  I also like the story and how well it touched upon themes in the original Wizard of OZ.

5640337,1,B00BL1BIP8,"As a life long fan of the Wizard of Oz, I will admit that I was extremely hesitant to even watch this ""prequel.""  However, the kids won out, so we rented the movie last night and I tried to give it a chance.  It was even worse than I imagined it would be.  I'm so offended by the film that I don't even know where to start in this review.  I'll start by saying that the female characters (Kunis, Weisz, and Williams) do the best they can with the material and are the only good points in the film.  James Franco, on the other hand, killed a little piece of my soul with his awkward, stilted, and BORING performance as the Wizard.  He just doesn't have the personality to pull off the role.  Not that it was written particularly well, but instead of making the most of it, he actually takes in the opposite direction.  His performance makes the lack of story and decent writing even more obvious.

The over-the-top CGI is distracting and not exactly ""breath-taking.""  It seems like a gimic and looks a lot more like a Dr. Suess landscape than what you imagine as the Land of Oz.  Two of the main characters are CGI...and look it.  There is no moral to the story.  There is no heart.  There is no moment where you feel like you've watched something that you would watch again.  And then have your children watch.  For over 70 years.  My five year-old son doesn't even want to watch it again.  And he will watch a movie 100 times if he likes it. But there is no magic in this film.  Just some bad writing, bad acting, bad computer graphics, and two hours of your life wasted.  Oh, but you do have a munchkin song.  After which you'll want to flush your ears.  Yes, it's that bad.

I have to go watch the real Wizard of Oz now to cleanse my palate and re-fill my soul.",1378080000,6,1764,4.231231231231231

5640339,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I'll skip the expected comparisons between this new film and the classic 1939 musical.  The greatness of ""The Wizard Of Oz"" casts a tall shadow over anyone that attempts to make a movie based on the popular L. Frank Baum books.  That said, director Sam Raimi has largely succeeded in turning an old, yet familiar, world into something relevant.  I'll be the first to say ""Oz, The Great And Powerful"" is a disjointed blockbuster; but doggone it, this picture acquits itself with a satisfying conclusion.  Actors Mila Kunis and Michelle Williams are out of place in the fantasy genre regrettably, while Rachel Weisz nails her part.  Overall, this is a great-looking film that works in the right places despite its warts.
  COMMENTS:  { SPOILER ALERT }  As Mila Kunis's character, Theodora, slips into darkness and jeolousy, one sees that her tears burn her face.  Not to be a complete wise guy here, but if the Wicked Witch melts when water is thrown on her, how does she take a bath?  Also, how dumb is Theodora anyway?  It is obvious that her sister, Evanora, spied on her using a crystal ball.  Wouldn't that make one suspicious?  I mean, couldn't the nave young sister ask one question before willingly eating a magic apple that disfigures her appearance?  Also, poor Kunis sounded like a bratty ten-year-old every time she raised her voice.  That was distracting.",1378080000,,1366,4.823275862068965

Yet this remake succeeded in presenting a new and fresh approach to the movie and its themes that answered some suggested and unanswered questions of the original work.  This was fun, refreshing, inspiring, and yet personal.  Keep this in our library for replay and keep the original in your heart as a keepsake and comparison of the newest springboard.",1377475200,,551,4.649484536082475
5640461,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I have to admit, I'm not one of those in my generation that thrives on the internet and other gadgets like tablets and  smart phones (though I do use a cell phone a lot), so maybe it's just part of my semi-old-fashioned take on some things that prevented me from fully appreciating the storm of special-effects used in this movie.  I liked the black and white start to the movie, and the sudden transition to color in Oz, but I believe the computerized effects were majorly over-used.  First, before I incur sneering from someone who is a fan and is in the tech world, I, too, am heavily involved in the tech world currently, including doing programming.  And I like special effectsespecially compared to some goofy costumes and other effects that were used back in the day.  But special effects have their limitover-used, just like a character in a movie who can throw in funny one-liners, can become just plain annoying.  Pretty soon I felt like I was watching a computer-animated movie, like A Bugs Life, but worse than that (I like computer animated movies, but I like live-action movies when thats what I expect), the computer effects actually managed to distract me from the plot line.  Its like an artist who is so enthralled with being able to do one kind of stroke, or paint one certain object (like a dog) well, that they focus too much on that and ruin the rest of the painting, or make all their paintings look too-alike for someone who wants a variety, yet likes the artists style.
*Spoiler alert here*  Second, aside from the background and scenery and sometimes computer-animated characters, I was a bit disappointed in character development, and sometimes what felt like a lack of reasoning for why a character acted the way they did, as well as it taking too long for the main character, Oz, to morph into a moral guy.  Now, I do believe that the directors/screenwriters/etc. did a good job for reasoning why the first witch that Oz meets eats the apple her sister provides.  But why is that first mean sister so mean in the first place?  And how does she manage to trick the other sister; though that sister is a bit nave, is she really dumb, too?  And besides that, I was actually depressed by the fact that the sister who becomes the wicked witch of the west went from a charming, happy, go-lucky, nave girl who quickly develops a crush on Oscar aka Oz, into a terribly wicked person who hates Oz and wants to destroy him and her own good sister, even to the shock of the first mean sister.  I guess Im the sort of person who always hopes that even the bad characters will show remorse at some point (such as Darth Vader in Star Wars).  I do like how the good sister, who remains good, really sees through Oz unlike her nave sister, yet still thinks he can be a good guy and help stop her mean sister.  And I would be lying if I said I didn't like the romance, more obvious at the end, between the good sister and Oz.
Overall, The Great and Powerful Oz is fun to watch and has a happy ending that includes the a few clever tie-ins to the beginning characters in Kansas (I recall something about a trained monkey), similar to the good old Wizard of Oz movie.  But it sometimes gets you lost in computer-effects and may disappoint you as wellI mean, gosh, shouldnt someone whos nave and only sees the best in people still be good at the end?  It stinks, in my opinion, that she is the one who seems to be the meanest at the end, with no hope of changing back in sight (unless the screenwriters for subsequent films intend to pull a Darth Vader moment at some point, unlike what is shown in The Wizard of Oz).  Perhaps I just feel sorry for her in this movie, unlike in The Wizard of Oz, because I saw how she was before.
Maybe the plot parts I don't like actually come from Frank Baum, the writer of the Oz books, and not the screenwriters, I don't know.
Anyway, this review is getting too long and could turn into a screenplay itself of how I would have liked the story to go, if I keep on going.  But since re-writes are not my thing, only writing new material, I must sign-off.",1377475200,,4098,4.411140583554377

5640470,3,B00BL1BIP8,"It's a shame that Sam Raimi felt the need to homage the 1939 celluloid tragedy that cast a near grown woman as a little girl and is so sugary, disgustingly dripping over-the-top that I have to side with the critics and audiences that originally made the film a flop.

That said, there's some good stuff here, and a full-on non-musical new version of the actually book ""Dorthy and the Wizard of Oz"" would look promising.

So first the bad: The film, especially the beginning, not only plays visual homage to the '39 film, but the dialogue as well. Stiff, stunted and unnatural sounding people like to blame Franco for his performance, but seriously, read his lines, mostly they're horrible. The real shocker though, and I didn't see this in 3D yet, is that for much of the early scenes in Oz it's so obvious they are on a green-screen it's not funny. It literally looks like they placed live actors in an animated film. Though scenes like the tornado and the final battle with the witch sisters are fantastic to look at, the simple shots of waking down the yellow-brick-road are jarringly bad.

The good: It's always fun to see what lead up to events, even the horrid Star Wars prequels proved we had to see it, at least once. I don't care what anyone says, Franco does an excellent job and I think he was perfect. The relationships with the characters mostly worked, considering his co-stars where a bell-hop winged monkey and a broken porcelain girl, they where the best GGI in the film. Mostly the film was well paced, well acted and entertaining if a bit of a clumsy and pointless throw-back.

The odd: Here is the synopsis, albeit scaled down, for both Army of Darkness and Oz The Great and Powerful: Trying to escape attack our hero, hapless and hopeless and a bit of a liar and show off is sucked into a spinning vortex and dropped into another world. There he is mistaken for, and accepts the role of, the one who will use his powers to save them, except he's a fraud. He falls in love with a local, but she is turned into an evil creature and joins the enemy. So he uses his knowledge of the modern world to win the battle with gizmos, tricks and machinery and at the end is redeemed and revered.",1377475200,,2204,4.475124378109452

I can't be glad I spent only 3.99 on the rental since it's not worth even that trivial amount.

Like many of the critics mentioned, the movie was long and terrible. The acting was poor and forced. I enjoyed the scene with the wizard making a show at the end, but too little too late. I was seriously considering not finishing the movie, something I've read in other reviews, and something not common for me.

In the end, too much time concentrating on the effects and visuals and too little time thinking about the story and how to honor the original 1930's film. I don't see how they could ever bundle these two movies together.

The China Girl is one of the most appealing synthesized characters I've ever run across--really quite novel.  I enjoyed the saturated artificial look of Oz and overall I found it quite an acceptable prequel to the classic from the 1930s.

What an excellent movie! It was true to the source material while telling a different story, as this was a prequel to The Wizard of Oz. James Franco was surprisingly excellent as the somewhat smarmy showman Oz, and the way things worked out wit the Wicked Witch of the West was very well done. You can't go wrong with this one.

5640536,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I have been a huge fan of the Wizard of Oz movies since I was a kid. I probably watched the wizard of oz nearly a thousand times over my 26 years because of its amazing staying power and magnificent story. That being said, I was skeptical of this new adventure into OZ and the review I had read did not help my skepticism. After watching this movie in 3D in my home, I can safely say that it was not as bad as others claim. The actors were chosen very well, the amazing detail and colors were vibrant and inspiring, and I loved the 3D effects. I believe that this lined up really well with the Wizard of OZ, but I actually hope they look at remaking the entire OZ chronicles. They have a great start with this movie and a would look forward to seeing future OZ adventures using today's technology. I am not going into as much detail simply because I don't want to spoil the fun of this movie. If I had to give one down side to this movie it was that I couldn't help but say ""Shut up Meg"" at different times. It was not Mila Kunis's fault, she did really well, but I have family guy embedded into my mind. Bottom line is this is a movie worth buying if you are an OZ fan, and the 3D really didn't feel like a gimmick as it does in other movies.",1377129600,,1243,4.036437246963563
5640537,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Maybe I like this because I was not such a huge fan of the original ""Wizard of OZ"". Also, I think seeing this film in 3D makes a huge difference. It is amazing how Sam Raimi makes use of the 3D effect to create depth and texture that makes the film pop off the screen.

If you take this film on it's own merit as a unique production seperate from the original, this is an immensely satisfying film. If you absolutely love the original and expect a prequel to that film, you will likely be disappointed. Warner Brothers took quite a bit of artistic license in the original film that they have copyright over. This presented a real challenge to Sam Raimi and the writers. If you pay close attention to the film there are a lot of hidden gems regarding characters identities linking back to the original film and within the new one.

Ultimately, just sit back and enjoy the story and the film. To paraphrase Glenda in the film...This may not be the Wizard we were waiting for, but it is the best Wizard we have, and I and my family really enjoyed it. The ultimate test is that both my wife and my 7yo son have watched it repeatedly.

That is the ultimate thumbs up!",1377129600,,1162,4.321100917431193

James Franco in the role of Oz simply does not carry the vaudevillian weight that Frank Morgan brought to the role in the 1939 original.  And it's hard to imagine Franco growing up to be Morgan.  Further, the writers let Franco down by not giving him much to work with to develop his character.

5640612,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Oz the Great and Powerful, in my opinion, is a fun and entertaining film, for the most part, and a worthy entry in the Oz series.  The world and characters of this film are fun and colorful, with some exceptions.  This film, however, has some flaws which bring the movie down for me.

The main cast is colorful and fun to have an adventure with.  Oz starts out a jerk, but I still liked him, because you can tell he has a good side.  By the end of the film he becomes a very likable character.  The side characters are also fun.  My favorite character of the film would be the little china girl.

However, the villains, I thought, were bland and non-engaging.  Mila Kunis, in my opinion, did a bad job as the wicked witch of the west.  She did not have the presence or the charisma that the original wicked witch had.  The other witch was fairly boring also.

The production values for this film are great.  This movie does a good job at creating a beautiful looking world immersing the audience in that world.  The design of the residents of Oz looked great too.

People are divided over this film.  Some like, while others do not.  This is most likely because people compare this to the original film, the Wizard of Oz.  I do agree somewhat.  While this film is a good, film, and in some ways superior to the original, this film I do not find as memorable as the original.  I still, however, find this to be a very competent and enjoyable film.",1376697600,,1446,4.324626865671642

5640658,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I tried to really like this movie, I did.

It's the only OZ movie we've gotten since, ""Return to OZ"" one of my all-time favorite childhood movies with Fairuza Balk for the first time ever. I tried to keep comparisons to the classic icon, the original Wizard of OZ to a minimum and to understand that nothing was going to live up to those expectations.

But even with those considerations I can't, in good conscience, give this movie anything more than 3 stars because for me it was simply a mediocre movie.

It felt like the magic and the life of OZ had been sucked out and in its place was a metric crap-ton of CGI. I really miss the practical effects of the old days. There's just something tactile, something tangible with practical effects that you just don't get with CGI.

The story basically fills in the gaps with information about how things came to be in the first movie; unfortunately it didn't give us anything new and I was kinda hoping for a little bit more. The story felt rushed both in the narrative of the story and it felt like maybe the writers were scrambling to get done and lacked a bit of depth. However it was interesting to learn the origin story and see the transformation of both the Wizard & the Wicked Witch.

In the end it was an entertaining movie and I did enjoy it, but I was let down. I feel like the source material is so rich and vibrant and this opportunity was a little bit squandered on a lowest common denominator, giant-douchey-corporation-approved film that will get mediocre responses from the widest range of audiences while being awesome to nobody.",1376438400,,1594,4.520833333333333

5640661,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I rented the movie first before I purchased it. Anytime you make a prequel (or sequel) you never know what you're going to get. I gave it a perfect rating for the following reasons.

Very good acting: You didn't have your typical ""A list"" movie stars, which I'm fine with. There were some recognizable faces such as Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis, and James Franco. Names you know but maybe not too well. Nobody over acted. You could tell it felt genuine which means they had some very good writers.

Historicity: Since L. Frank Baum did not write a prequel to ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" the script writers of this movie had their work cut out for them trying to cog together how each scene or scenario would have or could have happened leading up to the 1939 film. The tiniest mistake and anyone who know the ""Wizard of Oz"" by heart would have noticed. The historicity was magnificent.

Plot and story: The plot isn't a straight forward ""this is how it happened"". The writers and producers led you on a wild goose hunt while the story unfolded. Almost like a great mystery novel ""who done it"". They did it in a good way though. If you haven't seen it then you don't know what I mean. If you have then you know what I'm talking about (SPOILER: Wicked Witch).

Overall: Great family movie. It's as clean as the 1939 film. Cinematography was good and the CGI wasn't real cheesy. I think this movie goes so well with the original plot that you could watch this movie and ""The Wizard of Oz"" back to back and it would be near flawless in the storyline.",1376438400,,1548,4.440140845070423
5640662,1,B00BL1BIP8,"This movie was very disappointing. The acting was terrible, the plot was horrendous. The visuals, however, were fantastic.

5640677,3,B00BL1BIP8,"When I saw trailers for this movie, I admit to being extremely hesitant about watching it.  There were a number of reasons for this, the first and foremost being that sequels/prequels/remakes of any movie are always a crapshoot, and trying to update or add to a classic film such as ""Wizard of Oz"" is even riskier.  And despite ""Wizard of Oz"" having its own set of flaws (it's admittedly trippy and corny, and the special effects, while phenomenal for their time, show signs of age), it's still a beloved classic by many, so any attempts at a re-imagining or addition to the tale would be met with skepticism and scrutiny.  The fact that I'm a huge fan of the ""Wicked"" musical, which has it's own take on the land of Oz and the backstories of some of the classic characters, didn't help either.  But I decided to give the film a chance anyhow.

The verdict?  This film looks gorgeous and acting is decent, but a bad script bogs everything down and is bound to give many viewers headaches.

""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" follows Oscar Diggs, a sleight-of-hand magician traveling with a second-rate circus through rural Kansas.  Something of a womanizer and egomaniac, he dreams of doing great things... but even he isn't prepared for destiny to come crashing down on him when a tornado sucks him into the fantastic land of Oz, where two witches immediately declare him the king of their world.  At first Oscar is thrilled, but the witches tell him his newfound throne comes with a price -- to rule Oz he must fulfill a prophecy and destroy the Wicked Witch who killed the previous king, and thus save Oz.  Armed with only his wits and parlor-magic tricks, and with the aid of a sour-tempered Munchkin and a wisecracking flying monkey, Oscar sets out to defeat the witch... only to find out that who's wicked and who's on his side isn't clear, and that he may end up becoming a pawn of more malevolent forces.

Perhaps this film's greatest strength is in its appearance.  The visuals are GORGEOUS, with vibrant colors, imaginative creatures and scenery, good special effects, and beautifully rendered costumes.  Oz looks every bit the marvelous land I imagined from the books, with its own surprises and its own dangers, but it also pays visual homage to its predecessor in many ways.  And in a few areas it even manages to improve on the old film -- the evil flying monkeys (more like bat-winged baboons in this incarnation) are obviously CGI, but they're genuinely terrifying in this film, instead of being people in goofy costumes.

The acting in this film is decent as well, and the actors do the best they can with the script they've been given.  James Franco does a superb job at playing Oscar Diggs, and his performance somehow reminds me of Robert Downey Jr.'s rendition of Tony Stark in Ironman -- an arrogant playboy who gradually develops a heart and a sense of honor as the film progresses, and something of a gadgeteer genius.  Rachel Weisz is obviously having too much fun as the villainess, and Mila Kunis is genuinely heartbreaking, creating a sympathetic character even in her most over-the-top moments.  Michelle Williams is incredibly bland in comparison, but then, she isn't given much to work with in this rendition of Glinda the Good.  And the supporting cast has some great moments, most notably Joey King as a China Girl (no, not a stereotypical Chinese girl, an actual girl made of china -- it makes sense in context).

But the script is what brings this movie down.  The actors do their dogged best to bring the characters to life, but they're given very little to work with.  James Franco plays an excellent copy of Tony Stark, but that's just what it feels like -- a copy of something we've already seen before.  The ""trickster becomes a hero"" plot has been done before, and while old plots can be given a fresh twist and done again, it felt like this movie didn't bring anything new to the table.  And it becomes difficult to root for Franco when he womanizes everything in a skirt, treats his friends like dirt, and does precious little to redeem himself by film's end.

The three witches suffer the most, however -- they're all cardboard cutouts instead of interesting characters, and while it's interesting to see the two wicked witches play Oscar as a pawn in their game of power, it becomes tiring when said games descent into a love triangle.  Mila Kunis does manage to bring some pathos to her role, and was on the verge of becoming a decent character... but the filmmakers decide to throw all that out the window and use a combination of magic and ""jilted lover"" clich&eacute;s to abruptly turn her into a villain.  And after seeing a far more realistic and heartbreaking fall to darkness for this villainess in ""Wicked,"" her turn to evil in this movie felt like a bad joke.

This movie feels like a fantasy version of ""Avatar"" in my mind -- gorgeous to look at and with some interesting ideas, but with a tired plot and uninteresting characters to go along with it.  I'd watch this film again, but only because of the visuals and the valiant efforts of the actors to salvage something from the script.  In the meantime, I prefer ""Wicked"" as my ""Wizard of Oz"" prequel of choice, thank you...",1376438400,,5225,4.6663031624863684

The flying monkeys in this pic are much more frightening, the world of OZ is more in depth with new characters of equally fantastic backgrounds to meet and that does a certain service to the imagination of Frank L. Baum who wrote the books of OZ to delight his generation's children. However the stylized story and music that made the 1939 such an enduring hit are not here and we are awash instead with CGI and mediocre humor. (Note to Disney...give up trying to make money on properties of books you own that date back to 1906...kids today are not that well educated so the soaring adventures of  John Carter, the Lone Ranger, citizens of OZ and so forth do not stike a cord with the youth of today.)

James Franco's Oz, though, was always kind of smarmy and really never changed, which made viewers want to dislike the main character throughout the entire movie.  It was also too long (2 hours 11 minutes) for no good reason. If editing had been tighter I would have rated it a little higher.  And if Oz had been likeable, it could have come close to a 5.  It's still worth seeing, but... it's not worth much. Rent it for cheap or borrow it from the library.",1376179200,,546,4.44

The whole thing is ridiculously over-colored and the in-your-face 3D effects are really annoying. Zach Braff's voice is good as the monkey though.,1376179200,,291,4.84

5640733,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I had heard a lot of great things about this movie before watching it. And maybe that was the problem. I went into the movie with preconceived notions of how great it would be, but after watching it, I honestly didn't know how to feel about it. It wasn't that I hated the movie, but I also wasn't ecstatic over it.

""Oz The Great and Powerful"" provides a great backstory to the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie. Most of the acting was superb! Rachel Weisz, Mila Kunis, and Michelle Williams all did wonderful jobs portraying the good and wicked witches. James Franco - who I normally find to be a fine actor - only did an okay job in his role as Oscar Diggs/Wizard of Oz; for a good chunk of the movie, he seemed to be phoning in his performance. Visually, the movie was absolutely beautiful. And the connections to the original ""Wizard of Oz"" added a nice touch to the movie (for example, ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" starts out in black and white and transitions into color when Oscar Diggs arrives in Oz, much like how the original was in black and white and Dorothy landed in Oz).

This movie is definitely worth watching at least once!",1376179200,,1136,4.404761904761905

It wouldn't have made a difference to me which way they decided to take it, but they couldn't make the decision and that lowered the quality of the movie immensely.",1376092800,,422,4.3544303797468356

This film seemed to hit all the right ideas about what would happen in the storyline for a prequel.  The movie had a good flow to it and the land of OZ was beautiful to see on HD!

  I did enjoy the discovery of why the wicked witch is green.

If it hadn't been for my 2 year old daughter, well, I wouldn't have revisited it (somehow her mother is to blame BUT a happy wife is a happy life or so some would say) That being typed, loved Sam's version. This isn't a remake or retooling with all the singin and dancin, it's Sam Raimi with his up close camera now back now sideways now front camera angles. It's Evil Dead w/o the ""I'll swallow your soulllllllll."" Don't feel cheated or slighted because extras and a 2D version weren't included. Was glad to read a sequel was in order although Sam may not be associated with it. Oh please don't let there be any singing... I could have easily set out on a course to describe in boring and yawning detail about the 3D but it's something some folks should experience in the home for themselves. Some are subtle and some are ""oh neat that was cool"" specifically the plant like thingy's. For me it's way up there on the 3D must see movies.

The witches in the movie are excellent and the story line behind their goodness and wickedness keeps you interested.  The whole premise behind how/why The Wizard comes to be is pretty creative as well.  The only part I thought went on a little too long was the beginning.

Pros:
- Great story
- Amazing special effects
- Great resemblence to Wizard of Oz (I bet they would have had as much color in the Wizard of Oz as well.)
- Humorous at times
- Just like in the Wizard of Oz, people in Kansas represented people in Oz.
- An overall fun movie to watch

Cons:
- I didn't like how Oz was portrayed in this movie as a show-off and player.
- Definitely not a movie to take little kids too. I jumped in my seat a couple of times.
- The ending feels a bit empty at first but it warms up to you.

Disappointed with the decision that Disney made about the packaging options.  No *COMBO PACK* available.  EVERY other 3D movie I own, there is a BLU RAY disk included which allows me to watch it in other players in the house, not JUST the 3D player in the living room.

The acting is also decent. I didn't feel that anyone was particularly bad...or exceptionally good, either. James Franco comes across as indifferent on occasion, but I feel that that was the nature of the character.

It looks very good in HD.

Danny Elfman, as usual, puts together a fantastic soundtrack that is appropriate and powerful.

I would give this film 4 (possibly 5) stars if not for:
1) 130 minutes is too long in this case. The 'decent' acting would be immediately upgraded to 'well done' with  15-20 minutes trimmed (at least, that's how the audience would feel). Every few minutes throughout the first 45 of the film, I was looking at my watch. I even considered turning this off so I could watch 'Ghost Rider 2.' Not because GR2 is better, but because it would waste less time.
2) The obvious 3D cinematography. I can't overstate how annoying this is in any film. If I want to feel like I'm ""in the movie,"" I'll go to the Disneyland ride, based on the film.

Unfortunately, these two massive flaws killed it, which is really the most frustrating part of watching OZ: after it's over, you know that there is a great film hiding in there and find yourself disappointed by what could have been.",1375574400,,1272,4.581497797356828

5640883,4,B00BL1BIP8,"It takes a lot of hubris to make a sequel to a beloved classic. It takes even more skill to craft something remotely worthy of such a classic. I think of the novels Scarlett, a sequel to Gone With the Wind, and Cosette, a sequel to Les Miserables, and shudder. The news of a film prequel to The Wizard of Oz struck me as a blow to fond memories of a childhood classic. I was completely uninterested and ready to write it off until I found out the director's name--Sam Raimi.

Raimi is famous for directing the Tobey Maguire Spider-man movies, though he has had a long history of horror, fantasy, drama, and comedy film making. Often, all in the same film. He has a distinctive and imaginative style. If anyone could pull off another Oz movie, it would be him....or Stephen Spielberg.

Oz the Great and Powerful tells how Oscar Diggs came from a traveling circus in Kansas to the land of Oz. He runs a magic show for the carnival and wants to be a great flimflam artist but he can't make it to the big time. He tells a girl in Kansas who wants to marry him that he doesn't want to be a good man, he wants to be a great man. She wants a good man but he's not interested in small town life. After his fateful balloon ride, Diggs is mistaken for the prophesied wizard who will defeat the wicked witch and become the just and benevolent ruler of the land of Oz. Diggs is, of course, no wizard, but he is a man of great ambition, and the fabulous wealth of Oz is a great temptation to him.

The story follows a rather predictable arc, especially for anyone who has seen the original film. Nevertheless, the movie is full of invention and visual splendor, perfectly suited to Raimi's cinematic style. The actors are fairly good, though James Franco as Oz gives only an adequate performance in what should be a star-making larger-than-life role. It is a devilish hard mark to hit and I don't know who would have done a better job blending the ambition and the heart that are required for the role.

Overall, the movie is a joy to watch and I am sad that I didn't see it in the theater in its full glory. I watched it on a plane and want to watch it again on a bigger screen with better sound. It's not a classic but it is fun and might grow more charming with repeat viewings.",1375488000,,2268,4.267441860465116

And the bad witch/sister turns her good sister into a bad witch worse than herself? And the good sister didn't know her own sister was evil? Please.

5640904,2,B00BL1BIP8,"And people thought ""The Hobbit"" was an overly-delayed prequel. It has nothing on the prequel to the classic movie ""The Wizard of Oz,"" which came out almost 75 years after the original.

Unfortunately, it's easy to see why ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" turned out to be a massive disappointment. It tries to coast on all the recognizable people and things from the original ""Wizard of Oz,"" in the hopes that you won't notice the tacky CGI, the lackluster acting and the plot composed almost entirely of cliches. In other words... pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

While escaping an angry husband, stage magician/con-man Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (James Franco) escapes in a hot-air balloon and is sucked into a tornado. Of course, he arrives in the widescreen, Technicolor paradise of Oz.

He is is quickly hailed by the witch sisters Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz) as the legendary wizard who will save them all by killing the Wicked Witch. Oz is more than happy to oblige, since success means he will become king of the Emerald City AND get a Scrooge McDuck vault filled with treasure. So he sets off to kill the Wicked Witch.

Turns out Evanora is the true Wicked Witch, and the witch he's pursuing is the Good Witch Glinda (Michelle Williams). And with Evanora -- along with the newly-transformed, very angry Theodora -- preparing to assault Glinda's domain, Oz has to come up with a plan to defeat a pair of powerful witches, with an army of Tinkers, Munchkins and Quadlings. Can a wizard triumph without any magic?

When you peel away the pyrotechnics and CGI, ""Oz The Great And Powerful"" doesn't have a lot of substance. It's yet another story about a con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in Hollywood?) who is called upon to become a hero and reform himself. Every single aspect of this story is painfully predictable -- you can guess exactly what will happen all the time.

In short, ""Oz"" feels sort of like a marshmallow peep: sweet and brightly colored, but empty of actual substance. And after consuming it for awhile, you start to feel a little queasy.

It doesn't help that Sam Raimi's signature style is nowhere to be found -- it's smothered in a vast sea of giant CGI flowers and glossy, fake-looking panoramas. The movie is crammed full of unnecessary CGI (why do the evil witches FLY everywhere?) and references to things from the original movie... and yet, strangely, no ""ruby slippers"" origin story. There are also a couple of comic-relief sidekicks (a china girl and a talking monkey) who are inserted just for the comic relief -- and instead they make this rambling movie feel about twice as long as it actually is.

But there are a few saving graces -- mostly James Franco and Rachel Weisz. Franco is oddly convincing (if a bit hammy) as a white-smiling wastrel who aspires to ""greatness,"" but who isn't such a bad guy after all. And while Weisz's character is OBVIOUSLY evil right from the start, she brings a brittle, charming energy to her character's outright evilness.

On the other hand, Kunis is relentlessly awful. At first she's a simpering, prancing little girl just experiencing her first crush. But after her transformation, she shows her evilness by glaring at people and making your ears bleed with her screeching. Leave the screeching, posing and scenery-chewing to Margaret Hamilton.

Williams is almost as bad. She plays the connivingly saccharine Glinda as a doe-eyed, sentimental damsel who seems pathetically weak and stupid compared to the powerful Wicked sisters. Seriously, she even gets captured by a pair of flying monkeys WHILE HOLDING HER WAND. Even Oz seems more magical than she does.

""Oz The Great and Powerful"" tries to dazzle you with CGI and charm you with comic relief, but it doesn't flesh out a pitifully underdeveloped plot.",1375488000,,3823,4.866153846153846

Why did you take OZ and turn him into a guy whose sole purpose in life is to get every woman he meets into bed?

Why did you take a character who spoke some of the best and most complex prose the movies have ever seen and give him the same IQ level as a high school dropout?

How could you take a world and a storyline so simple in focus and so complex in process and turn it into just another damn episode of `Friends?`

Shame disappeared a long time ago.  It`s too bad.  We miss it.  A lot of people miss it.  At this particular point of time, I miss the quality of the movies it used to produce.

I especially liked the Kitschiness of the scenes. It was reminiscent of the original Wizard of Oz. The scenes were fantastical and cheesy and very entertaining. The story followed the principles of the original film and offered nice, but not overtly, modern elements.
I can't give it 5 stars because it wasn't the blockbuster I wanted it to be, but it was still a worthy and satisfying prequel.",1375228800,,808,4.905109489051095

Many decades later (and after The Wiz) I really loved the Broadway musical ""Wicked"" because it captured what I had come to understand about the story for more than 40 years: the enduring importance of women's relationships to each other and women's inherent power, both of the young and old.

All the actors were way to stiff, fake and unlikeable. Normally Mila Kunis, James Franco, and Michelle Williams are superb actors, but I think the combination of bad directing and bad writing did them no favors. Not even their talent could save the film. The art direction dragged the film even further down.

The special effects felt way too dated and flat, for some reason. The colors were way too artificial, and way too neon. There is color that pops off the screen and then there was this. I could see what they were trying to do with the film; trying to mimic the experience of the original Wizard of Oz. I would respect the homage more if it were done well.

Overall I would say the directing and writing really killed this film. The special effects and art direction didn't help it any either. One saving grace of the entire film was seeing the emerald city as it was originally designed in the Wizard of Oz. You get a sense of how massive the city is in the film from the 1930s, but never really get to see it as well defined as it is here.

5641053,2,B00BL1BIP8,"I looked forward to watching this movie because I thought an explanation of what preceded The Wizard Of Oz would tell the whole story.  In some respect Oz did do just that.  My problem with the movie was it could have been so much better.  If only Steven Spielberg had done it and not Disney.  Spielberg did such a good job with Hook.  Oz had way too much fluff among the plot.  It couldn't decide if it wanted to be a children's movie or adult's.  It was embarrassing to see the way the Munchkins were introduced.  If only the brief musical numbers had been of the same quality as those in The Wizard Of Oz.  Much of this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor.

The idea of the piranha like Water Fairies was the first hint that Oz was going in the wrong direction.  James Franco,the actor who played the Wizard, reminded me too much of Jeremy Piven who played Mr Selfridge in that he as was whinny and annoying.  When the flying monkey first dealt with Oz's carpet bag, it was so heavy that he could only drag it, but minutes later, he had it flung over his back and was walking at a good pace.  Later it became light enough that he could fly carrying it.

A nice touch was a Mr Gale was mentioned over a loudspeaker during the sideshow sequence before Oscar took off in the hot air balloon: This gave a connection to Dorthy.  I did like the setting up of Glenda the Good and the Wizard but it was unclear which of the evil witches was the one which Dorthy Gale would vanquish in The Wizard Of Oz.  I suppose that it was the one who turned green and the other was the one under the house.

3) Cheesy 3D effects, wow here is a place we can put a object going towards the audience it takes away from the story but who cares. Hey we have 3d in this film, you know what was invented in the 1960's. If you didn't, we will push it down your throat.

5641171,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Oz the Great and Powerful(released Feb/13)stars,among others,James Franco,Mila Kunis,Rachel Weisz,Michelle Williams,Zach Braff,and Bill Cobbs. Walt Disney once again takes a crack at the Oz franchise and once again comes up short. It has a weak and meandering plot and an even weaker leading man.
The story finds our wizard as a side show entertainer in a circus,who longs to be more than he is. He is a magician whose bag of tricks are getting very old,very fast. He is good with the ladies but does not want to be pinned down by any one in particular,even one who would like to marry him. One day the circus strongman comes after him and he hops aboard the circus balloon to save himself. However this results in his balloon getting sucked into a passing tornado.
When he lands on the other side he is in the land of Oz. The first person he is greeted by is a good witch named Theadora. The two hit it off,as the wizard turns on the charm,and the two end up practically engaged;at least in Theadora's mind. When they reach the Emerald City,Theodora's sister Evanora is there waiting their arrival. His presence has alerted the entire kingdom and the prophecy of the returning wizard,they think,is apparently being fulfilled. Evanora tells him the kingdom is his to rule when he destroys the wicked witch who resides in the dark forest.
The wizard leaves for the dark forest with a flying monkey called Finlay he met on the way to Oz,and along the way he picks up another traveling companion,a cute little china doll. When they reach their destination they find their quarry and plan to just steal her wand and break it. Their plans go awry and they come face to face with her. As it turns out it is Glinda,the good witch of the south.
Evanora has tricked both the wizard and her own sister Theodora. Evannora,to retain an ally,shows her sister the goings on with Glinda through her crystal ball. It makes Theodora enraged. She gets so mad she takes a bite of an apple Evanora gives her,which turns her into a hideous green skinned evil witch.
The wizard meanwhile has been introduced to a  variety of Oz inhabitants by Glinda,including Quadlings,Tinkerers and Munchkins. The wizard and Glinda concoct a plan to attack the Emerald City. The first attack is by robotic scarecrows through the poppy field. Glinda lays a low""fog""over the poppies to hide them and as the flying monkeys descend down to field level,they almost all fall asleep. However two grab and whisk away Glinda. The wizard now has to hatche a further plan to get Glinda back. He has a balloon float seemingly away from the city with the him aboard. The balloon is destroyed by Theodora,and the bait is taken. The wizard reappears courtesy of a holographic like projector with smoke,which he uses to intimidate the two witches. Theordora flies off on her broom,while Evanora flees into her castle. There she and Glinda have it out and Glinda defeats her,but Evanora is taken away by two flying monkeys.
The film comes to its conclusion as the wizard presents his friends with gifts for their support and he takes Glinda behind his curtain for a romantic kiss.
The leading character in a film like this, would have to have been played by someone with good acting skills,and with charisma and panache,as that is who this movie revolves around when all is said and done. Franco was terribly miscast. His acting is weak and he looks terribly uncomfortable in his role. This undermined,for me,the entire movie,despite all the good special effects this movie spewed forth. Any moment of pathos,drama or comedy were severally weakened by his inability to ""bring it"".He couldn't even come up to the level of his fellow players,and as a result dragged many of them down with him.
As with many a Sam""Evil Dead""Raimi film,the director once again cast his old friend Bruce Campbell in a small supporting role. He is the guard at the gates of the Emerald City who gets hit on the head by Finlay(Mr. Campbell I'm sure could make much out of that!).I bring Bruce's appearance up for one reason:THAT is who should have been cast in the lead role. Bruce Campbell could have given that character exactly what the role called for;a depth and humour Franco couldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.
This film is kind of a prequel to the Oz books themselves,but it does mention characters like Quadlings,Winkies,and others that appear in the original books but have never been mentioned on film before. The film also has the odd salute to the /39 film.
Watch as the wizard leaves the Emerald City. In the background in a field,is the""horse of a different colour"".The best part of the film,I found,was the china doll character;CGI created at that.
Technically speaking the film starts out in black and white,in a square box,center screen. Then when the wizard reaches Oz,the screen expands to a 2:40:1 a/r and colour. The picture was clear and crisp. As with many Disney one disc DVDs,there are no extras.
All in all with a weak plot and an even weaker leading man,this film was doomed to fail. I couldn't get behind or believe Franco's role for one second. The special effects are good but it is not enough to make up for its other shortcomings. Barely three stars.",1374451200,,5205,4.73869900771775

Watching this on a 240hz, 1080p, 60"" HDTV... was freakin' awesome.  Wow.  Sam Raimi did an amazing job and the casting was good too.  Even went as far as paying tribute to the original by filming Kansas in Black and White, in the old style box tv screen as well.  So, don't adjust your screen settings when the movie starts...

5641181,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I have many,many,found memories of watching the original Wizard Of Oz growing up at my grandmothers house. I loved the music,wanted to be the Tin Man,and was terrified of the Wicked Witch. When I first heard the news a prequel to the original Oz movie was coming I was actually in the process of doodling a picture of the scarecrow!
coincidence?

The last real Oz movie we had seen was Return To Oz which wasn't bad in its own way but it certainly didn't compare to the 1939 film.
So how does Oz the Great And Powerful standup to the original?

First and foremost their,at least to me can only be one Wizard Of Oz. It was a product of its time and it can't be recreated,but wow,just simply wow. Sam Raimi and company really found the right balance here. This film pays a great amount of homage to the original but makes it ""modern"" enough for a new audience as well. It doesn't ever compete with the original,it instead builds from it. The characters are all great as well,my favorite being China Girl.
My only real gripe with the film is that I felt it started to drag a little towards its conclusion. I  simply felt their was no real buildup to the finale. This isn't a knock at the finale itself (which was great).

3D: Simply stunning. Not just the 3D either. The visuals as a whole are,for lack of a better word,gushing. From colorfully bright flowers and birds popping out of the screen,to graveyards covered in creeping fog,to small town black and white Kansas, Oz has many amazing sights to behold and they're all sure to knock you out with the biggest grin you'll ever have on your face. Oz doesn't just focus on the major details either. Their was small attention to detail that just amazed me as well. Something as simple as a waterfall flowing in the background. This will without a doubt,be a keeper in your 3D collection.

In conclusion, Oz The Great & Powerful is as visually stunning as Avatar on all fronts with enough heart to really make it a great movie. Just like the Wizard himself this film is charming and perhaps at times not sure of itself but that's just part of the Wizards grand and epic show.",1374451200,,2122,4.458762886597938

Think of the Godfather 2, despite Francis' recent statements, and how Robert De Niro was cast into the culture not just a film.  Sequels can be as good if not better than the first efforts as with Wrath of Khan and other examples.  This is not that.  Don't buy this, rent it if you must.  James Franco knew this wasn't working as he did it.  He knew the money was good and no one else would have promoted him this high so he went along with it and the trouble is it shows.

They tried to bring in memories from the 1939 movie and that was pointless. They did nothing for this ""story-less"" story- except remind you of the wonderful classic and how awful this one was.

For a sequel see the 1985 Disney movie ""Return To Oz"". It was a wonderful movie, with a great feel for the stories of OZ. The special effects, costuming and story were outstanding - there was true MAGIC in that version. In this one I felt nothing, nothing for the characters and nothing for OZ itself. Too much of it was CG, which made it cold and impersonal.

James Franco has charm but their having failed to book their first choice Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Oz leaves the film a weaker one . Downey would have surely brought so much more to the character and simple charm is not enough to lift this work to being a laudable one. It's a nice blu-ray of an extremely rich artistic vision but not so fulfilling on the story or casting end of things.

The story was predictable and not fully developed with dialogue revealing the holes in the plot.  Acting not so great. Visuals pretty good except for a few sound stage shots that looked dated (perhaps to pay homage to The Wizard of Oz movie?)

Wicked on Broadway is such a clever take on the origins of the wicked witch.  If someone was going to make a prequel, I would think they could be more creative than this film was.

Talented directors and actors have for decades taken stories from OZ and brought them to us in that attempt. Most of the time the story is warm and enjoyable (as is this one), but cannot touch the classic.
There are enough interesting scenes in this movie to make it watchable. There has obviously been some heart put into it. I, sadly found the acting a bit 'off' and never could accept any of the actors in their roles.
I can only say the movie is watchable and maybe if they had attempted to film it the old fashioned way with no CGI, it would have given it more of a prequel feeling of the classic.
Anyone notice that they DID leave a story untold for a sequel? They still must tell us the tale of the Ruby slippers...........",1374192000,,815,4.230769230769231

The characters and story plotting were surprisingly well done even if not perfect. Starring James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, Bruce Williams, Tony Cox and Michelle Williams.

But as in way too many corporate(Hollywood) films today, the story is too predictable, the dialogue is generic, and I found the characters for the most part absolutely uninteresting (the monkey sidekick is a little appealing). Mostly this was a sad experience for me. This is disservice to art and to the artists involved. This is what can happen when you take great talent and squeeze it through the corporate homogenization machine. It is painfully obvious that for example, Sam Raimi, is being restrained at most every turn here. The distinct unique spirit and expansive imagination of his early Evil Dead films is only glimpsed occasionally, usually briefly, leaving one with the feeling he had to sneak it in. And Rachel Weisz seems particularly wasted. Compare the lifeless flat character she plays here to the endearing vivid relief into which she modeled her Mummy heroine(yes, sometimes good artful movies slip through the corporate grinder).

The ""Wizard"" is a bastard, who the movie makes out to be a redeemed hero. Well, what about how quickly he turned against Theodora? I actually feel quite sorry, and it's amazing how no one tries to rescue Theodora from the curse. Once Theodora turns evil, that's it, she must be destroyed? What? No, ""oh she was really nice, there must be something nice still left"", just instant, unquestioning, ""now she is the enemy"" crap? A crappy film.",1373846400,,607,4.4774774774774775

The main issue is the movie itself and its lackluster story, characters and over-stretched length.  The plot begins charming enough, but quickly spirals into Oz's encounters with the hot witches and a kinda creepy looking doll.  The movie clocks in well over 2 hours which is much too long for kids and adults will get bored.  The ending looks pretty neat & provides nice visuals.

I like the 2D Blu-ray for my guests who have trouble viewing 3D. I like the standard DVDs to loan to my adult children as neither owns a Blu-ray player. I couldn't care less about the digital or ultraviolet copies as I use neither. The 3D release of this movie only comes with a digital copy. I can still play it in 2D, should I choose to, but I have no standard copy to loan to my kids.
I buy my movies on the day of their release to get a discount price, but neither Target nor WalMart received any copies in 3D. The 2D versions appeared to be available in several different configurations, including one with a slightly 3D-looking slip cover but wasn't 3D.
As for the movie, I liked it. I thought the storyline was good and nicely explained the origin of Oz as he first appears in the original ""Wizard of Oz"". Franco's acting came across as a bit stiff, but it's tough standing in a big green room and interacting with ""nothing"".",1373846400,,1062,4.315
5641347,4,B00BL1BIP8,"After the movie ended I wasn't really sure if I liked this movie or not. As you see I have given it 4 stars, so I eventually came to realize I did like it. I'd have given it a 3.5 if I could, because the cast was weak, all talented and all did well, but it was almost like they were the B team, like everyone Sam Raimi really wanted was out shooting another movie. James Franco did a great job with his part, he made the wizard a believable charlatan and fake put in an awkward position, you believed that he was shady and not totally on the level with everything he did. On the Oz side, of the witches only Michelle Williams as Glinda seemed to fit the character, where Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz seemed odd cast choices.
In the end they all worked well together on screen, the story was fun, the graphics were beautiful. When I think Sam Raimi my first thoughts are to Evil Dead, and this was the absolute opposite to a cabin in the woods. The colors and set pieces were brilliant. it was Oz come alive. And let me say I am not a fan of The Wizard Of Oz film, I respect it for what it was and the time, but as a musical it keeps me at arms length. And in this film when the munchkins begin to sing and the wizard waves them off and stops them, that immedately gave this movie another star. I want my fantasy to fantastic, leave the singing for the drama club.

I was a little confused by the digital copy... since I think it is a download, not a disc... but I typically don't use those anyway. If they are like the original digital copies, they last one year ( can you say ripoff?) and it is more of a lost leader like grocery stores used to used and still do in some cases. Sure, there is piracy out there, but I'm guessing if you pirate, you've already figured out the way around this... so only the regular consumer suffers. and now back to the movie:

It is filmed for 3D effects, but the colors are great, Mila Kunis is beautiful through most of the movie, Zach Braff continues to be hilarious, and it is very enjoyable. The flying monkeys are more aggressive than in the original, but again, maybe that is what today's audience is needing.

5641408,2,B00BL1BIP8,"First, it was my fault for buying this. It was an impulse purchase and I didn't read the details carefully ahead of time. But, this is a Disney product, I believe their brand stands for high quality and good value. This Movie and especially this edition of the Blu-ray do not meet my Disney level expectations.

3d Edition:
This edition ONLY has the 3d version on disc. Most Disney movies come in a graduated dvd, dvd+digital, dvd/blu-ray/digital, blu-ray/3d/digital configuration. Without thinking, I was expecting more.

There are NO special features on the 3d disc. There are apparently some extras on the digital download, but that will be another few hours to download on my slow DSL connection. This is why I buy movies vs. rent. I want to watch the extras, I am fascinated by how movies are made and how stories are told.

Also strangely, this edition decided that 2.0 stereo was the mix it would pick. It even warned me it was picking this; I had to stop the movie and switch audio tracks (I have a nice home theater setup. The DTS audio was no problem; and almost every blu-ray I've put in picks out DTS by default).

If anyone from Disney reads this, let me be clear. I will not make the same mistake next time. If you try to pass off a full price (nearly $30) version of this movie with discount bin features (no extras, no additional versions of the movie) I won't buy it - even if it is a movie I really want to see. That is what RedBox is for (Hey Amazon, discourage Disney from putting out low rent editions, I am willing to pay for commentaries, extras and special features).

The Movie:
Wasn't so good. But then taste is a fickle thing. Gave some back story to the classic Wizard of Oz; was only OK in execution. Didn't hold my attention (the 3d filming on this was strange, angles, gimmicks and distracting). Nor did it hold my 6 and 10 year olds' attention; they decided to go off and play with Lego instead.

5641455,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I love The Wizard of Oz and I have read all the books and watched all the movies. Yes, there are lots of books by L. Frank Baum. And while this is a pretty sincere attempt to pay homage to the original movie and borrow from the books, it seems too predictable. The performances of the witches are powerful and pretty great. James Franco, as Oz, has to work his way into the role as does Oz as the savior of Oz.

The movie is heavy with cgi which is great because the world of Oz is brought to life, but it's also sad because the original movie didn't rely so heavily on special effects. And the familiar Disney sidekick is used throughout the movie which can get annoying since it's a tried and true method to introduce comic relief for the company's movies as well as allow the main character to voice his/her thoughts. Here the sidekick is actually more interesting than Oz at times although he isn't as annoying or cloying like Jar Jar Binks.

The movie is a nice intro to a series of movies on the world of Oz and the various fantastical creatures there, but is that the intent here? My hope is that they continue to pay homage to not only the original movie, but also to the series of books.

Actually, once they arrived in Oz and the color came to life, I was done, but I continued to watch, TRYING to give it a chance via the story.  I probably didn't watch half of it before I left the children to it and walked away.

I suppose I'm so disappointed because The Wizard of Oz is one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of all time, if not THE greatest.  And without CG.  It was amazing, beautiful, and realistic.  Maybe I have Disney to blame for that because the minute he arrived in the land of Oz, I felt like I was watching Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Or The Incredible Mr. Limpet.  Only without as much realism.  The colors are TOO bright and bold.  The animation is TOO cartoon-like.  There is no way to pretend it's not entirely computer generated.  Maybe had James Cameron made it, it would have been awesome.  Maybe I'm spoiled by good movies.

The actors are great actors.  However, they had so little to work with, I felt like I was watching a Syfy original acid trip.  Franco as Oz was unbelievable.  Kunis was not at all appropriate for the role given.  Just disappointed.

5641545,3,B00BL1BIP8,"This movie looked wonderful in the trailers and I had been looking forward to watching it with my family at home on DVD, since I rarely go to the movie theaters anymore.  I was surprised that the movie did not do very well in the theaters, but decided to watch it anyway.  I finally saw it, and I think I understand why this movie was not well received.

The movie has nice special effects that still have a sort of classic film look to it.  This was as intended by the makers of the movie.  The result is that it does not look as ""high-tech"" or realistic as other movies made nowadays, but still manages to feel magical in an old-fashioned way.  The story was original, based on the books by L. Frank Baum.  I was particularly moved by the character of Theodora (Mila Kunis).  I felt that the development of this character was very well done.  The cast did a good job generally speaking, and they were well cast.

The real problem with this story, in my opinion, was the character of Oz.  James Franco did an excellent job as Oz, however his character was just not likable.  It's hard to root for a main character when he is a coward, selfish, a womanizer, a liar, and has generally no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Moreover, there is no real character development until the very end when he has some sort of epiphany and seemingly changes his ways.  The truth is that at this point of the movie, it's not realistic and is too little too late.  With the exception of his interactions with China Girl, he spends most of the movie demonstrating his low quality as a person.  The romance he has with the good witch was rushed and not believable.  In my opinion, if a romance is not developed correctly, the movie is probably better off without it.  The end result is that rooting for Oz is nearly impossible.  I found myself rooting for Theodora over Oz towards the end of the movie.  Considering Oz is the main character and Theodora is a wicked witch that is a bad thing.

Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but not as good as it could have been.  If they ever make another Oz movie focusing on these characters, they should really stay away from Oz as a main character and perhaps focus more on Theodora.  She is a tortured soul and, while tragic, is potentially much more interesting than the ""not-so great or powerful"" Oz.",1373328000,,2327,4.449172576832152

5641573,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Not a terribly daring or deep execution of this classic fiction. Somehow the actors never transcend beyond their more common methods of portrayal and I often found myself thinking more about the actors' personality than the personality of the character. I could just not get into James Franco's version of OZ. He did not play a very convincing period vaudevillian magician as he simply just did not exude that type of demeanor. An unfortunate aspect as this film must hinge on him as the leading man and his personal journey and discoveries through the fantasy kingdom. As a result of his underwhelming delivery I found myself kind of bored by him at the beginning, but I started to care more about him towards the end, even though his Oz was a jerk. Much of the same befell the lovely Mila Kunis' character as well though she did at times display a fieriness that sort of jolts you back into the film. The other actors did fair for what they were given.
This film may delight young children as the action is frenetic, the colors are vivid, the sounds are booming, and the chills are at times genuine. But the plainly obvious reality is that this film was made as another cash grab vehicle that fits in the bombastically colorful and spectacularly lavish visual effects package that Hollywood has been content at churning out for a couple of decades now. Its really everything you'd expect from films like these nowadays. All the money is up on the screen eager to delight and assault your senses; and all this with little of the charm that is present in older films about the wonderful world of Oz. But who needs charm nowadays when you have 3D glasses! Recommend only on a lazy afternoon when you and the family have exhausted the Pixar library.
P.S. I was delighted to find out that Bruce Campbell was in this film and eagerly awaited to see which character he would portray and hopefully lift up this, at times, dullard film. But sadly his part is so ""bit"" that he never gets a chance to chew up some scenery with his classic wink and nod wit! What a let down.",1373241600,,2064,4.551075268817204

The ""special"" effects were so poorly done they took us out of the movie. It seemed like most of the actors (I'm looking at you James Franco, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz) were phoning it in for the whole movie. Honestly Zach Braff as the flying monkey had the most emotion and realism to his role (if his animated body was only better). The best thing I can say about this movie is that, for the most part, it sets up ""The Wizard of Oz"" pretty well.

The story was about as original as a 4th grader's ""how I spent my summer vacation"".  Fortunately the $5 it cost me is no big deal, but I still feel ripped-off.

Sadly, after probably 40+ viewings, the original movie lost a bit of charm and quite a bit of ""excitement"" -- probably because we had an over-dose of exposure.

Disney has a masterful prequel to the original -- it brings to our attention aspects of the tale that I, for one, never ever considered.  Things like ""where did the wizard come from"" and ""how did he get his particular powers""?  And this fantastic film answers all these things and many more!

The filming, sets, colors, music, and characters are amazing.  Watch this and, IMHO, you and yours will probably watch it at least annually -- and probably follow this new feature with another run of the original.  It's a blast!",1373241600,,876,4.57051282051282

Unfortunately, this movie just doesn't deliver. My biggest problem with it is the uneven tone throughout. At times it seems like it was going for majestic dramatic sequences (which is more the impression I got from the previews), and at other times it relies on pure slapstick humor. The dialogue between Oz (Franco) and the monkey companion he acquires when he gets to the land of Oz is pretty corny and honestly unnecessary. Other important elements of the plot (like the relationship between the wicked witch and her sister) seemed underdeveloped to me, and it just seems like the makers of the film missed a chance to really focus on the deeper message at the heart of the original movie. All in all, there are a number of impressive visuals in the movie that are worth checking out, but I wouldn't recommend spending any money to see them.

5641686,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Overall, this IS a good film. But if you're expecting something that follows the original to the letter, you're gonna be disappointed, or pleasantly surprised, depending on your expectations. It's not the complete book adaptation that Return to Oz was. But it's not the happy musical either.

First, I'd like to explain why I only gave it four stars.

James Franco as the Wizard - In the beginning, he seems to be ok in the role. But much like Judy Garland's performance. It seemed that the script was perhaps written for someone else. In the original film, the script was written for Shirley Temple but her studio wouldn't allow her to do the movie. While Garland's performance is iconic to the original and she brought a kind of melancholy yearning to the role that the more 'cutesy' Temple never could have, it was clear that the role had been written for another actress, a younger one. In the case of Franco, he has a sort of Old Hollywood, pretty boy look, especially when made up for the Wizard. No doubt the reason that he was chosen. But some of his facial expressions seem forced, as if he had been told, 'look more like (insert name of actor really wanted)'. This is not so obvious in the black and white portion of the film, where I thought that maybe Disney did it intentionally, but there are times that it seems a little bit too 'forced'. But it's very obvious in the color portion. There are times when he tries to give that smile that is reminiscent of Johnny Depp in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or his kind of disgusted look from Sleepy Hollow. The projection of Franco's voice seems a bit forced as well, and he has a kind of 'modern' quality that I don't believe was intentional.

Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch - She has a kind of grotesque beauty, the same that Margret Hamilton had as the witch. While she doesn't have Hamilton's 'plain jane' type look. She has a more obvious, dark beauty. In the witch makeup, she does look believable. However...her hysterical shrieking, gets old. The first time, it's warranted. Then after that, it's like 'oh she's shrieking again...' I feel that a more quiet approach would have suited some of the instances better. Such as when the Wizard tells her that she may return to the Emerald City should she find goodness again, if she'd looked back and stoically said 'Never' perhaps with a little shake of her head and then laughed. It would have been more believable. But instead she shrieks it and flies off. It's also obvious that she's the voice of Meg in Family Guy. She has that same sarcasm in both Family Guy and That 70s Show, which detracts from her portrayal as the witch. Her costume doesn't fit her character. It's a more modern design, while her character suggests a more traditional or perhaps totally different design. Again, like with Franco's entire character. The witch's costume looks as though it were designed for someone else.

The clash of accents - There's a lack of congruity with the accents. First, there's the English accent of Rachel Weisz, while her portrayal of Evanora was very good. She was one of the few completely believable characters that was consistent throughout the film and seemed to be comfortable in her role. The more 'california or modern' accent of her sister seems out of place. As does the lack of the ethereal voice of Glinda. She has a quietness about her, but not the more 'angelic' voice. James Franco has a kind of flat tone to his voice, so he doesn't sound as though he's from Kansas nor does he have the rolling r's or the grand quality that the actor in the original had. Had he put that 'grandness' in his voice during the black and white portion, I feel it would have at least added something.

A childlike quality- This film is rated PG and some of it seems overly childish. No doubt because it is Disney and it was taken into consideration that a stronger rating would no doubt have hurt ticket sales since parents would have wanted to bring children. However, I feel that the overly brightness of the flowers and some of the sets in the initial arrival in OZ are a bit over the top. While the flying monkies of the witch have been turned into flying baboons that rip people to shreds. Then you have the cute little china doll running around, but she has a miniature knife in one part. It's an imbalance of the darkness and light. One thing seems overly childish while another seems overly dark.

A very suspicious Tim Burton quality - This movie has a very Burtonesque quality. Which at first made me smile. But as the film progresses, it's more forced. As if it were done by a fan or someone that was trying to give it a Tim Burton look. I think that maybe that was the problem. Danny Elfman does the music which is very suspicious since he does the music for nearly all of Tim Burton's films. There are certain suspect set designs and the opening sequence made me expect to see Burton's name SOMEWHERE on this film. However, it's not. In watching the film a second time, the Oz character as well as Theodora almost seem as though they might have been written for Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. The wicked witch's costume looks as though it were designed with Carter in mind, not Kunis. Which to me is very suspect.

Now that the cons are out of the way, here are the pros

Welcome deviations from the original - Normally when a film like this one comes along, it's either a welcome new film or a sad knockoff. I feel this one is the former. Because instead of making blatant references to the original and having a bunch of knock off music or characters, this film does stand alone. In the fact that there are parallel characters in the black and white sequence that are in the color sequence as well. But these character's names and look is different. For example a reference is made to a 'John Gale' not Henry. And all of the main characters in Oz are not showcased in the black and white sequence. Noticeably missing from the black and white portion, are Evanora, Theodora, Knuk and the master Tinker. Which to me suggests that this is not a 'dream' as was the case with Dorothy's trip to Oz. The only characters that are from the black and white portion are Glinda who plays a woman named Annie that is obviously in love with Oz and he returns that love but is unwilling to admit it or settle down. His assistant Frank, who's Oz counterpart is a talking, flying monkey named Finlay. And the little china girl who is obviously the girl in the wheelchair at his show. He couldn't help the girl in the wheelchair walk. But he fixed the china girl's legs. Symbolic of something he couldn't do in the 'real world'. Glinda is Glinda the Good from the SOUTH, not north. At times, there are musical portions that almost sound like Somewhere Over the Rainbow, but not quite and almost sound like portions of the original score, but not quite.

Absence of cheesy costumes - For 1939, the costumes were very appropriate in the original. But if they'd been referenced in this one it would have been a disaster. For example, having a kind of ball gown pink dress for Glinda or the large wand with a star at the end would have seemed childish. As would the over use of green in the costumes of the Emerald City Denizens. There is a use of deep green tones in the Emerald City clothing. But not the bright green over the top costumes. There's a kind of steampunk quality instead, that makes it very visually appealing.

No song and dance numbers - There's really only one song sung in the entire film. And it's cut short. Another welcome deviation from the original.

The absence of the original title characters - There is a lion, there are scarecrows and there are munchkins. But there's no Tin Man. No dancing scarecrow, no Lollipop Guild or Lullaby League. Which was very refreshing in my eyes.",1373155200,2,7823,4.529370134465676

Kunis, and Franco, were both wrong for their parts. Kunis cannot play either ""nice and innocence"", nor ""wicked and cruel"". Her brown eyed, sultry beauty just can't do that roll. No matter how much witch's makeup they use. Franco's smart ass grin, and mannerisms just didn't seem right on a wizard, either. Michelle Williams, was an awesome, and beautiful Glinda, however.

5641707,2,B00BL1BIP8,"DVD review for ""Oz The Great and Powerful""

""Oz The Not So Great and Unpleasant""

I watched this DVD wanting to get some inside information on the development of the characters. That was sorely missing, replaced by a world of special effects technology.  This was a prequel, yet the comparisons are going to be made with the 1939 very popular original classic ""The Wizard of Oz""
James Franco the actor who plays the Wizard of Oz in the recent released DVD, has taken heat as being miscast. The problem with the film does not lie on Franco's shoulders as an actor. It is the result of inept screenplay writing.  The writers here give us an unlikable con-artist, hustling character that the audience cannot have sympathy for when he (Oz) gets into trouble. With Dorothy of the original film, she captured your heart and you cared for her in the film.

Another problem with the film is that the land of Oz, was a figment of Dorothy's imaginative dream. Here in the latest film, Franco's character experiences almost the same scenario that Dorothy did in her dream in the original film. And like the original 1939 film, we have the same early black and white scenes and the same approaching tornado that quickly swoops up Franco's character the magician from Kansas to the land of Dorothy's imagination and dream. That's just it!  It was a dream not reality. Yet here director Sam Raimi tries to have us believe that both Kansas and Oz are both real.  Couldn't happen! How could a young Oz be in the same dream world Dorothy had some sixty years before she was born?

All the people that Dorothy knew in real life, were recreated as different characters in her dream. Including the old magician that she met in Kansas, and who she later dreamt as The Wizard of Oz. The magician character and OZ are two very separate entities, the magician in Kansas and later the Wizard of Oz.  Yet here in the latest film the magician and Oz are portrayed as one person, he does not wake up and all is  dream, no Raimi here makes the mistake of making the land of Oz real, Oz never leaves Oz.

Now, if this a faithful prequel history before Dorothy. How is she going to meet the old magician in Kansas who became the Wizard of Oz in her fantasy dream? She can't because director Raimi left him stuck in Oz.  So Raimi is trying to make us believe that both Kansas and Oz are equally real. That cannot be possible!

Another big problem is that two sister witches played by Mila Kunis and Rachael Weisz are wasted. All they do is bicker back and forth, and do an unnecessary battle with Glinda (played by Michelle Williams as the good witch) that came across as phony looking. Raimi should have delved more in depth into letting us know who these characters are the how they became the powerful witches they are, who they later became the witch sisters from the East and West.  Mila Kunis with green face makeup is not a micro-fraction as frightening as the original wicked witch of the West played magnificently by Margaret Hamilton. Kunis looks too cartoonish as the green witch and does not have the evil persona that Hamilton possessed for that role.
And those ruby red slippers? ""A huge part of ""The Wizard of Oz"" Come on you know they're going to remake it! Raimi had the chance to let us know all the backstory which is what a prequel is supposed to do. Here it does not succeed.  The latest Oz edition has strong special effects yet a very very weak story.

5641708,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I liked this enough to buy it but understand those who think otherwise.

Visually this movie is stunning. However the plot, character development and the actors performances left much that could have seen improvement. I didn't care all that much for either of the 'evil' witches. Their acting was at best ok. And I was disappointed in James Franco's performance - I've seen him do much better than this and that's the real problem - this movie NEEDED his best and didn't get it.

The plot was uneven and the character development needed - well - development. The scene with the porcelain girl was great but the real problem was that was about it.

I guess what is missing is a clearer vision of what they were trying to do. I was never sure what this movie was really about.

It's a real shame as this movie had the potential to be a true classic. The start wasn't bad and the porcelain girl scene was great - the ending was ok as well - but the rest was just kind of there.

If I could I would give this 3.25 out of 5 on Amazaon's scale

5641716,2,B00BL1BIP8,"Disney produced a ""Wizard Of Oz"" related movie decades ago that, while relatively imaginative, was not well received by the critics or the public alike. One would think Disney would have learned something from that experience.
Now, ""Oz, The Great And Powerful"" is out, also by Disney, and this new movie also misses the mark. Visuals and computer imagery are generally well done, but the movie suffers significantly from script and casting issues. There is also an attempt in the script to make the new movie more contemporary, but the effort misfires. Any ""magic"" associated with the original ""Wizard Of Oz"" movie starring Judy Garland is clearly missing from this movie. This might be an okay movie for kids, but we are nowhere near ""Movie Classic"" territory here!

Keeping with certain themes and departing in others, I enjoyed the contrasts and similarities between the original and this movie.
Michelle Williams was captivating and embodied Glinda so well.
Mila was amazing as well!  Oh - so scary once she turned!
Zach Braff's character wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be and I really enjoyed him in this film when I've never been a fan before.

5641719,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Spoiler alert: If you haven't watched it already, I might spoil some of it for you with what I'm about to say.

I could barely get through the first half hour, and I did so griping and swearing because it seemed so bad, and I had just spent $5 renting the HD version. I thought about walking out of the theater, marching up to the ticket counter, and demanding my money back, only the theater was my living room, and I couldn't bring myself to write Amazon such an email. I went to bed picking apart what I had seen and finding all the problems with bad acting, terrible dialogue, and weak story.

The next day, I forced myself to sit down and finish it for no other reason than the money I had spent. I sat there with my arms crossed and a pouty look on my face thinking the next hour and a half would be torture, but before I knew it, I was laughing, and I even ended up shedding a few tears. I should add to this that it was the 4th of July, and I am relatively patriotic, and this movie has a patriotic theme with the land of Oz fighting for independence from the rule of the witches. And it is entirely possible that I might have been slightly intoxicated (I'm going to watch it again soberly today to see if I have the same feelings :-)

I like Zach Braff, but I think of him as a television guy, and while I enjoyed Garden State, I don't think he has learned how to think like a movie actor yet. It was partly his lines in the first thirty minutes of this movie that made me hate the movie so much. The dialogue just seemed so badly written. But it was Braff who rescued the movie for me when I started watching on the second day, and his character of Finley the monkey got me to laugh. Then the China Girl entered, probably my favorite character in the movie. What really saved the story for me was Glinda, and this is what gets to the heart of my problem with the story.

I guess Oz is supposed to be a shady guy with a good heart at his core, and my life has taught me more and more not to trust shady guys, even when I believe they are good at their core. Knowing they are good deep down does not redeem them for me, and as long as they keep lying, tricking, manipulating, and pranking, I do not want them anywhere near me, and I will respond with anger if they try to trick me. But then, I was raised by a US Marine who had absolutely no patience for BS. My sister idolized Judy Garland, and has a collection of Wizard of Oz memorabilia, so I am pretty familiar with that movie, and I know that Oz is revealed to be somewhat of a s****** in the end, and that is apparently where the character is supposed to find its core of meaning and arc. So as I'm watching them delve further into Oz's character, I'm waiting for it to redeem itself, and in the end, he doesn't end up revealing greatness, just goodness, but what I wanted was greatness, at least if he is to become king (err, rather, wizard). If he is at best just a good guy, then fine, he should take the role of a secondary character, but if he is to become king, he's going to have to impress me on a whole nuther level beyond magic tricks. Can you imagine if Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings ascended to the throne of Middle Earth by means of double talk and slight of hand?

My other problem again centers around the character of Oz, or rather, the person they chose to play him. I guess I just do not like James Franco, or I have yet to see him play a role that I like. I kept hoping they would just focus the camera on one of the beautiful actresses and leave him out of the shot because his appearance just rubs me the wrong way. They apparently asked Robert Downey Jr. to play the role, and I wonder if I would have liked it more with him, but I suspect the weak character would prevent me from enjoying it played by any actor.

When Glinda entered the story, I breathed a sigh of relief that we had finally found a strong character. I read the following quote from producer Joe Roth on Wikipedia:

""...during the years that I spent running Walt Disney Studios -- I learned about how hard it was to find a fairy tale with a good strong male protagonist. You've got your Sleeping Beauties, your Cinderellas and your Alices. But a fairy tale with a male protagonist is very hard to come by. But with the origin story of the Wizard of Oz, here was a fairy tale story with a natural male protagonist. Which is why I knew that this was an idea for a movie that was genuinely worth pursuing.""

Does he really think Oz is a strong male protagonist? A strong man walks around lying, cheating, and tricking people? A strong man becomes king only through dumb luck, and despite his own cowardice? There are two strong characters in this entire story, and they are Glinda and the China Girl. The China Girl proves herself to be a bad ass in spite of how fragile she is. Glinda amazes me with her patience with Oz, and the ability to bring out the best in him, however pathetic his best is. That she believes in him causes me to wonder if I should be more patient with and forgiving of the s****** in my life, and that is where the story redeems itself for me.

I'm giving it five stars because of Glinda, the China Girl, the visuals, and the character of Theadora - while I couldn't be more bummed that they made Mila Kunis so ugly, I can't keep from hoping that she will some day find her goodness and beauty again, even though I know full well how her story ends. I was worried about Mila early on in the story because her dialogue seemed to bad, but I thought she did well with the role once she turned green. And I got over my gripes about terrible dialogue when I realized it was probably necessary for this type of fairy tale, although I can't help but wonder if it could have been just slightly better written.

One last thing, I don't appreciate Sam Raimi making me jump out of my skin with all of his sudden scares. I am a sensitive person, and tend to be high strung, and I have never been a fan of horror movies, although I did think Army of Darkness was pretty cool. He lulls you into a sense of peace and quiet and then surprises you by suddenly throwing a loud and scary monster in your face, and I just don't appreciate that.",1372982400,4,6207,4.156405990016639
5641720,5,B00BL1BIP8,"While this story could have been somewhat better, there was quite a bit that was great. Oscar Diggs is a con artist and a magician for a small circus,he does have big plans as one day he hopes to be truly great. Unfortunately, his act is good enough that it causes a little girl to plead with him to make her walk again and his act fails on the stage when he reveals that it isn't possible. He leaves back to his wagon and meets with the true love of his life, only to discover she is to marry another. While their parting is amicable, it is hurried because the circus strong man is after him in a jealous rage and he makes for a balloon and manages to escape by the proverbial skin of his teeth and a cut rope--into the grasp of a Kansas Twister. He manages to survive and finds himself in Oz where he meets Theodora. While there he discovers he is the subject of a prophecy, that he is to face the Wicked Witch and ultimately rule Oz as the King. What he doesn't know, is that one of his greeters, Evanora is the Wicked Witch, and while the gold offered is extremely tempting, he isn't sure he can do what they think he can. He finally meets Glinda, thinking her the Wicked Witch only to discover the truth about the Witch -and he and his allies must find a way to defeat her,when the threat becomes double when Theodora finds her heart broken and become Wicked.

5641723,1,B00BL1BIP8,"This entire movie was a Tim Burton-style (yes, that's a bad thing!) showcase for special effects.  What we get is a barrage of color-popping highly dynamic scenes with little bits of plot thrown in to get us to the next effects-laden high-speed chase/swim/float/baloon ride/fall through the admittedly lush, pretty and color-laden landscape.  But below the shiny veneer is... nothing.  And maybe the entire film was a meditation on and symbol for the nature of the Land of Oz itself:  much as (in the original) the Wizard behind the curtain ins't really there (or at least, he isn't a wizard), the same can be said about this film.  To quote Gertrude Stein:  there's no ""there"" there.  Pull away the color overlay and you've got decay.

I expected more from Sam Raimi, though I'm not sure why; since Spiderman (the first), everything he's done has been pretty craptacular (""Drag Me To Hell"" being the notable exception), and this was no different.",1372982400,,947,4.911949685534591

James Franco sells the young, sly, not very wise, Carny Magician, and Mila Kunis masterly plays the witch who becomes the wicked witch of the west. Michelle Williams is very believable as the Good Witch Glinda. She doesn't get the praise she deserves, probably because everybody loves to hate the villains and they do steal the show a bit.

5641781,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Since the 1930s, Walt Disney had wanted to make a film inspired by the 1900 American novel ""The Wizard of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum.

Unfortunately for Disney, with the success of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", it gave Samuel Goldwyn the idea that films about fantasy would do well in the U.S. and thus he acquired the rights and re-sold it to Louis B. Mayer in 1938.  And this would result in MGM developing the musical adaptation ""Wizard of Oz"" in 1939.

Walt Disney would later revisit Oz with an idea to create a musical during the 1950s with the Mickey Mouse Club titled ""The Road to Oz"" but the plan was dropped.  Another Disney opportunity to revisit Oz as a live-action film did happen in 1985 titled ""Rainbow Road to Oz"", but at that time, Disney films were not doing that well in the box office.  Disney would lose the film rights to the OZ books and the books were reverted to public domain.

But for screenwriter Mitchel Kapner, having read the sixth novel in the series ""The Emerald City of Oz"", Kapner wanted to explore the origins of the Wizard of Oz and so, Kapner tried to present it to other studios but to no avail.  But Walt Disney Pictures decided to give a film adaptation a chance and Sam Raimi (""Spider-Man"" films, ""Darkman"", ""Army of Darkness"") was hired to direct ""Oz the Great and Powerful"".

The film would star James Franco (""127 Hours"", ""Spider-Man"" films), Mila Kunis (""Black Swan"", ""That 70s Show"", ""Family Guy""), Rachel Weisz (""The Mummy"" films, ""The Fountain"", ""Constantine""), Michelle Williams (""Shutter Island"", ""My Week with Marilyn"", ""Dawson's Creek"") and Zach Braff (""Scrubs"", ""Garden State"", ""Chicken Little"").

The film would become a box office success, earning over $490 million.  And now ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray + DVD+Digital Copy, Blu-ray + Digital Copy and DVD + Digital Copy courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in June 2013.

VIDEO:

""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio, 1:33:1 at the beginning of the film).  I can honestly say that ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is one of the best looking Blu-rays I have seen in 2013.  Colors are vibrant, skin tones are natural, CG elements manages to look convincingly real and world of Oz with its lush green mountains, colorful flowers, clouds, high above Oz and seeing the environments during the day and even the look of the city during night with fireworks, flames, etc.  This film looks amazing!

There is so much to be impressed about with this film.  Close-ups of the characters show great clarity and detail, CG clouds to characters like Finley and even China Girl look fantastic close up!  Even the make up design on Mila Kunis as the wicked witch is impressive!  The mouth movements are perfectly aligned with what the character is saying and the film including production and costume design (as well as makeup design) are wonderful highlights to this film.

During my viewing, I saw no artifacts or banding, no crush and nothing negative when it comes to picture quality.  If anything, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!

AUDIO:

""Oz the Great and Powerful"" won me over with picture quality but how is the lossless soundtrack?  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HDMA, English .1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, this film is immersive.  The soundtrack for its many action sequences along with Danny Elfman's music makes the soundscape so immersive with audio well utilized, LFE happening during the action sequences and I was impressed! From the scene where Oz arrives in Oz during the beginning of the film sounds amazing but once you get to the chase scene, soldier marching or even the plan enacted by Oz, audiophiles should be pleased by this active, immersive lossless soundtrack!

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Like many people who have watched the classic ""Wizard of Oz"", anything made after this film based on ""Oz"", many would like to dismiss it.

But for fans of the 1985 film ""Return to Oz"", despite it not doing well in the box office, fans of the L. Frank Baum books were supportive of the Disney live-action film because it was a faithful adaptation of the novel.

Since 1985, so much has changed when it comes to technology and recreating worlds.  And with the 2013 Disney film, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", it gave director Sam Raimi and writers Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire to create a film, with a skillful and talented crew to recreate the world of Oz and give us a visual feast but also a storyline that the young and old can easily be entertained.  But I felt the film captured the fantasy and its efficacy lies in the fact that the world of Oz can look so gorgeous in the film, even though it may have been created via CG and the talent were acting around a blue screen.

From the visual appearance of Finley, the flying monkey or China Doll, just the smallest details when it came to textures and detail, I was in awe by what was created.  Production design, costumes were magnificent and sure, the talents were superimposed on CG backdrops but it was well-done. It was convincing and it looks so amazing on Blu-ray!

James Franco managed to play Oz...the magician, conman and womanizer with brashness, humor but also bringing dignity to the character.  Mila Kunis did a wonderful job of portraying the wicked witch Theodora, but I would have loved to see the character of Theodora in much more pain before her transformation into the vile, green witch...which would be known as the Wicked Witch of the West.

As for Evanora, Rachel Weisz has done a wonderful job of playing an antagonist with amoral affection to her sisters but I was waiting to see if the film would make a correlation to the magic shoes which would become part of the Wizard of Oz.

And Michelle Williams as Glinda, also known as the Good Witch of the South in the novel.  The moralistic and caring character played with gentleness similar to her glistening and radiant version portrayed in the Wizard of Oz.  Primary difference is that Glinda was accused of crimes she did not commit and is a bit unsure of herself, while the later version of herself is calm and self-assured.

This leads me to wonder if Disney plans on making a trilogy or more films based on L. Frank Baum's novels especially with ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"", the second book.  One that introduces the scarecrow and tin man but features a new protagonist named Tip and the witch of the North, Mombi.  It would be a great tie-in to the films of showing how the scarecrow and tin man came to be and possibly introducing the character known as Ozma.

With the box office success of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", I would only hope that Disney does continue the story of Oz, as it would provide a very good connection to ""The Wizard of Oz"".

As for ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", I was hooked by the film's visuals but the storyline was fascinating and I was entertained but also wanted to see the origin of the witches and Glinda the Good and of course, Oz.

For parents, personally I think the original ""Wizard of Oz"" had more frightening elements than ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" but I can see some younger children being spooked by seeing how the Wicked Witch came to be or perhaps the scary look of the evil flying monkeys.  But ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a wonderful family film that both young and old can equally be entertained.

The Blu-ray release was magnificent as colors were vibrant, detailed and I saw no hint of any artifacts or banding, the picture quality was perfect.  The lossless audio was immersive and will no doubt make audiophiles happy.  And as for special features, you do get a good number of them included on this Blu-ray release.  I have been spoiled by magnificent Disney releases on Blu-ray that  I was hoping to see more when it comes to special features.  Especially with audio commentary tracks or just lengthier featurettes, so I felt the Blu-ray release could have had more special features included.

I know there are people who have issues with the Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy being released separately.  While some companies choose to include their Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray 2D films together, Disney chooses to keep them separate but that's their decision and perhaps for future releases, they may consider people's pleas of releasing one release versus two separate releases.

Overall, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a gorgeous, thrilling and captivating film that has potential for even more sequels within the world of Oz.  I'm confident to say that ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is one of the most beautiful films I have seen on Blu-ray for 2013 and also to have a complimenting lossless soundtrack that is immersive.

""Oz the Great and Powerful: Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy"" is highly recommended!",1372896000,,10620,4.747001090512541

5641867,1,B00BL1BIP8,"Another true example of when special effects don't save the day...

This was one of the worst prequels I have ever seen...and I've seen Star Wars episodes I, II and III. Where to begin...

The Acting:

The acting was so poor that I looked to the monkey for any kind of dramatic emotion. The acting by James Franco, Mila Kunis and Zach Braff was lazy, unmoving and quite frankly pitiful. I would have rather seen Mark Wahlberg play the monkey and just glue fur all over him. I felt little to NO connection between Franco and Kunis and felt they could have built the characters more instead of focusing on the grand visual effects. Franko's lack of expression or enthusiasm in his Oz character was a huge turn off and did not allow for the audience to suspend their disbelief. None of the actors sold their roles. Dissapointment all around.

Special Effects:

You can tell the art department really did a fantastic job building the digital sets and expanding the scene beyond anything the original Wizard of Oz could have done. Had a very reminiscent Alice In Wonderland feel to it. But the visuals alone do not carry the weight of the film and shouldn't be relied upon to make a movie great. Great job in this department.

The Musical Score:

The score was decent but I felt they just kept replaying the same thing throughout the entire movie and didn't have me gasping or fill me with emotion like other masterpieces have.

Overall Score:

0.2/10  Worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. This deserves no awards, no recognition and no publicity. I hope the actors are ashamed of themselves and this is a true reflection of what Hollywood has become; complete crap. Why do people pay movie prices to see this garbage?

If there are problems with the film, it may be that James Franco plays a bad actor, so he is often acting obviously bad on purpose.

5641896,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

The story of of Dorothy and friends traversing through the land of Oz is one that has stood the test of time. Whether you are young or old, a movie enthusiasts or not, The Wizard of Oz is a tale that you are likely to have seen. But what happened before Dorothy landed in this strange world and set out to take down the evil Wicked With of the West? Was she always so wicked? And what about Oz? Where did he come from? These are all the questions that Oz the Great and Powerful attempts to answer and it does so pretty successfully. Through vibrant colors and a new group of likable characters, Oz the Great and Powerful reopens this world that captured the hearts of many in hopes of providing some backstory while at the same time appealing to people of all ages.

After the disastrous attempt at recreating the world of Wonderland back in 2010, I found that I was very skeptical going into Oz the Great and Powerful. To say that I was pleasantly surprised with the end result would be a bit of an understatement. Once the film starts the viewer is greeted with a tiny box in the middle of the screen sporting some beautiful black and white visuals. This throwback lasts for about 20 minutes as we meet Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (James Franco) and learn a bit of his backstory and who he is as a person. This black and white segment ends with Oz getting sucked up into a twister (I smiled) and finding himself in the land of Oz. Upon meeting Theodora (Mila Kunis), Oz is sent to take down Glinda (Michelle Williams); who he's told is the wicked witch.

Oz quickly finds out the truth about Glinda as she tells him who she is and what her place is in the land of Oz. Along with Finley (Zach Braff) and China Girl (Joey King), Oz sets out to find the truth about this mystical land and attempts to help these people through lies and deceit - they believe him to be ""the great wizard"". The story progresses and we see how the Wicked Witch of the West came about and we also get to see the third sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), the Wicked Witch of the East. Filled with heartfelt moments and a handful of references to the 1939 film, there's a lot to love about this origin story. However, the end result is far from perfect.

My biggest problem with Oz the Great and Powerful is that everything seems a little premature. The story, the visuals, the script; none of it feels completely polished. While the film is filled with beautiful environments and bright colors, nothing seems real. Now I know that sounds weird when addressing a film about a mystical land full of witches and munchkins, but it's true. From the moment Oz found himself in this world I suddenly felt disconnected. No longer did I feel as engaged as I was moments earlier because the entire thing is one obvious green screen. There was clearly a lot of time and effort put into making this world come alive; I just wish the same effort could have been put into making it feel like something I could physically inhabit.

While both the story and script have their fair share of surprises, they too could have used a little more time to develop into something truly spectacular. At times I found that the characters became predictable, as did the dialogue and some of the scenarios we found ourselves in. You have the selfish Oz who gains a heart by the end of the film, the obviously evil Evanora who turns out to be the real antagonist, and many other obvious character outcomes. The dialogue, while strong for majority of the film, gets pretty corny in some areas. Most of it comes from either Theodora or Oz himself, but none of the characters are exempt from saying something stupid at one point or another.

With that said, Oz works so well because it has charm. You meet Finley and China Girl - I found it weird that she wasn't given an actual name - pretty early in the adventure and they were honestly my two favorite characters. Finley was probably there more for comedic effect for the younger viewers, but he really helped balance out the obnoxious personality of Oz. While his reasons for assisting Oz were a bit cliched, his presence was appreciated as he helped add a little heart to a situation when Oz became a bit too much for me to handle. China Girl was just an adorable character in general and hearing her little feet clacking when she walked made my heart melt. Also, the animations for both of these characters was very well done, as was the make-up for the Wicked Witch of the West.

Performance wise the cast was kind of mixed. James Franco gave another Franco performance, but I think it was the character of Oz and his dialogue that really turned me off. Mila Kunis gave another one of her inconsistent performances that ranges from really good to just plain awful. Rachel Weisz was ok, but nothing breathtaking or extremely memorable. If anyone really delivered it would be Michelle Williams. She was the perfect Glinda and she was probably given one of the strongest roles in the film. Just an all around great performance from her.

Overall Score: 7.5/10 - In short, Oz the Great and Powerful is solid. It's gorgeous to look at, borrows from some of the same elements found in the original, and once again we're given a nice, diverse cast of characters. However, as a whole the movie is inconsistent with itself. It never really reaches its stride because majority of the time it seems unable to find its footing. It constantly stumbles and it would have greatly benefited from some more time and polish. Still, it's a nice experience and one I would recommend to any family or fan of the original.",1372636800,,5636,4.507827788649706

The film moves at a very odd pace -- sometimes it just drags on and you almost lose interest and then it zips through important plot points.  Oz, at most times, is an unlikeable character that was hard to root for and most of the relationships between the characters felt forced and uncomfortable.",1372636800,,387,4.361111111111111
5641907,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Had this been a standalone movie, with no mention of Oz, it would've fallen in line with a summer popcorn flick, like Pirates of the Caribbean (although I like Pirates better). As a prequel, this movie shouldn't exist (kind of like The Matrix, parts 2 & 3). There are so many reasons why The Wizard of Oz stands on its own, and doesn't need a back story. However, being that they chose to go there, here are a few reasons why this film falls short.
For starters, Raimi attempted to replicate the feel of the original film's flow (black and white to color, Kansas characters showing up as Oz characters), and did so poorly--it felt more like copy catting, than an homage. Then there was the land of Oz. Here Raimi failed to capture the quaint fairytale environment of Oz, and instead decided to make it look like epic Whoville, from Ron Howard's horrible re-telling of How The Grinch Stole Christmas. The environments are extremely CG, with no organic texture, just a lot of bright colors and ""3D.""
And the Wicked Witch--ugh, what a disappointment. First of all, I don't recall Margaret Hamilton wearing a bustier in the original, but maybe she ditched the Playboy Bunny look, when she realized she had no chance with the Wizard. I don't have a problem with the idea of the witch starting out as a befuddled, attractive young girl, who gets duped into the ""dark arts"" by her psychotic sister, but if you're going to go that route, casting an actress who can actually act wicked is a good place to start (Mila Kunis can't act AT ALL, so that should've been a red flag from the outset).
There are a lot of little things I'll forgo mentioning, because I really don't have time to pick the movie apart, and I actually don't hate this film, it's just not memorable. The bottom line is this: there are certain classic, landmark films which SHOULD NEVER be re-made, re-booted, or expounded upon, and The Wizard of Oz is one of those films. But, if you just HAVE to see this movie, then go in expecting it to not live up to the 1939 original, and you might not be let down by such a large degree.",1372636800,,2087,4.480314960629921

The acting is fairly good from everyone, Franco is great and the voice acting is great also especially the monkey, Finley, who never comes off as Jar Jar Binks and is a fun character in the movie.

5642008,3,B00BL1BIP8,"James Franco is an actor that hits you as either spell-binding or over-reaching in his performance.  I genuinely cringed during some of those moments in 127 Hours.  And he portrayed a genuinely interesting friend-turned-bad-guy in the Spiderman series.  Now, this seemed a bit of an odd role for him if you are stuck in his Pineapple Express, pot-smoking days as a thespian.  So, step outside of your comfort zone.  It is an interesting take on the set of Oz stories.  A bit campy at times (thanks to Zach Braff who will never shed his cheeky ways) and a bit odd when you throw Rachel Weisz into a role that she seems unaccustomed to... or perhaps I haven't seen enough of her film work.  You might wonder why it merits only three stars in my opinion.  In a word... Disney.  The film is good, not great.  It's slightly above average, and certainly not part of the common swill that Hollywood is generating.  That being said, Disney tacks on their ""we are better than everyone else price"" and all films they produce automatically get a -1 star rating from me.  Go check it out at your favorite retailer.

5642080,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I went to see this ""free showing"" at my local college and really did not have much expectation for it. A Disney film, eh, that's for children and I am 61 years old. James Franco, a lead actor. Yeh, he is good as a no. 2 actor in a movie,  but I doubt he could be a lead. 0h, well it is better than watching the boob tube at home.
After watching this 2 hr. 15 min. long film, I can honestly say that Man, I was 100 percent wrong.
This movie floored me.
This is the best Disney film ever made. May not be the best movie ever, but certainly Disney's best.
And not only James Franco is great as a lead, but I can say, he is as good as Robert Downey. I was not a Franco booster before but I am now.  Kunis is very, very good but everyone else was good too as actors.
First, this movie is a prequel to the Wizard of Oz, and it explains how The Wizard of Oz gets to Oz 40 years before Dorothy. What is unbelievable is that this intelligent younger Oz becomes the blow hard Oz in the first Wizard of Oz movie. But that is not Franco's fault.
Second, this movie is about personal transformation for two leading characters, interthwined with a love story. Redemption for one and hell for the other. I won't say more about that because it will ruin it for those who have not seen it. I will say, don't let your anger define you, it may lead you to something that you will regret for the rest of your existence. Just ask, Darth Vader.
Third, it is about triumph for those who believe and who are brave enough to act when everything points to defeat and death.  Heck, 100 percent of the gambling money would have been that evil wins in the middle of this film. But not at the end.
Does this sound a bit hokey? Guess what, what do you think the messages were in the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie? It was not just about Judy Garland singing. Welcome to the land of Oz. Except, this movie becomes more intense and hits your emotional buttons in the middle and especially at the end of the movie. If I wasn't repressed, I might have cried at the end.
This movie sent me to the Land of Oz, physically and emotionally.

No sex, no graphic violence and no four letter words, although there are a couple of scenes that may scare young children.
This is a Disney film mostly geared to adults and teens.

Special effects are great, music is too, and the acting by all is fine. This is not a musical.
The first 15 minutes are in black and white and a bit slow, but ride this pony and watch the rest of it. You won't be disappointed. Franco plays a POS character in that beginning, but he gets so much better later.
Buy the Dvd, and see it at home with a loved one. Make sure you have your popcorn and drinks before starting this film, cause you don't want to pause it. You will feel warm, positive and fuzzy afterward. It will change you in believing that there is good in all human beings. That there is love in all.
When your spirits are low and your faith in your fellow human being is lower still, watch this DVD again. It will do better than any alcohol or medication or weed.
Show the film when you have friends over and they have nothing to do. They will not have heard of the film before but afterwards, they will marvel at your film knowledge wizardry and probably go out and buy it themselves. They may not admit that to you. It is a Disney fil,. For adults?
This film is a keeper. I will go further. This is a film that I am going to give someone in my will. It might explain to them what you are all about. It will melt anyone, even the ones with the coldest of hearts. This film can transform you and them. But maybe not the film critics. They have no hearts. In the film, having no heart was the pre-requisite in becoming the ""Wicked Witch"".
P.S. I know that there seems to be many negative reviews here, but it is interesting to note that the ""Wizard of Oz"" did not become an iconic film until years later after its release, when it was first shown on television in the mid fifties, when many more viewers first saw it. Maybe this will have to be the case for this movie as well. I have faith in the better nature of humanity, now.",1372550400,,4122,4.14107365792759

Whoever thought it would be a good idea to have James Franco anchor this film should be made to go back to casting 101. He was neither great nor powerful as the womanizing con man or the reformed Wizard.  Oz the vapid and inept was more like it. He had two basic facial expressions, grinning like a crazed monkey and constipated. He alternated between over-acting and just phoning it in but I never got the feeling that he was ever actually in character. I've seen grade school plays with better performances.

The three witches were not mucn better and the worst if them was Mila Kunis' Theodora.  Kunis does petulant and spiteful really well (i.e. Jackie in That 70's show) but ""magnificently evil"" is way beyond her skill set.  And when she morphs into the Wicked Witch of the West the green make up actually emphasizes her chipmunk cheeks and instead of looking like she would eat kittens and small children - as a proper wicked witch should - she looked like a 7th grader in a Halloween costume! I kept looking for her plastic pumpkin to see if she had collected any candy. The great Margaret Hamilton, who WAS magnificently evil as Miss Gulch/WWW, must have been spinning in her grave.

The movie was too long, too boring, and while I was glad I rented it on PPV instead of paying to see it in the theater, it was definitely not worth the 5 bucks I spent on it.  Unfortunately, it apparently made enough money that they will probably film a sequel.",1372464000,,1645,4.409240924092409

5642099,4,B00BL1BIP8,"It was brave of Disney to make Oz the Great and Powerful given the fame and great respect given
to The Wizard of Oz (1939).  I was surprised Oz the Great and Powerful was as good as it is.
Much of its success is a result of some very impressive and beautiful CGI effects.

There was a lot of disappointment, and even anger, as shown in many of the reviews here,
about this movie.  I don't know what people expected but I found myself fairly satisfied
with most of the aspects of it.

The script is the weakest aspect, using terminology that did not exist in 1905, the time this
movie is set within.  People just didn't say 'WOW' and things like that, at least I don't recall
seeing that word in any literature from that era.  Little anachronisms like that pop up with
regularity and stand out like pimples on an otherwise lovely complexion.

I didn't have a problem with any of the cast.  James Franco is very good as the charlatan
carnival side-show magician.  His transition to the Wizard of Oz flows naturally out of the
background of his character's life, and the tie-in with his Kansas life and that of his Oz life
is thought-provoking and touching.

Seeing this movie made me wonder if Oz hadn't really died in the tornado and what we are
viewing IS his experience of heaven.

Nods to The Wizard of Oz are frequent and apt.  The blonde woman who truly loves Oz
in Kansas turns out to be Auntie Em, as she tells him she has been asked by John Gale,
Auntie Em's husband in The Wizard of Oz, to marry him.

Then Oz is blown away by the twister and finds Auntie Em as Glinda the Good Witch of
the South.  At least that is my take on it.  It's there in the script.

The three witches are all very good as well.  Rachel Weisz is wonderful as Evanora, who
I think is probably the witch in the stripy stockings in The Wizard of Oz who has been
killed by Dorothy's falling house.

Mila Kunis, aside from her occasional Bronx accent, is a beguiling Theodora.  Her broken-
heart, caused by the callous Oz, and her transformation into the
green-fleshed, as in poisoned by jealousy, Wicked Witch of the West, is entirely believable.

Michelle Williams could easily have been a saccharin Disney Princess type, she looks it, but
she is given most of the funniest lines and she delivers them with a pretty poker face and
slight twitches of her mouth.  Of the three witches hers could have been the biggest flop
at a characterization but her Glinda is one of the big acting successes here.

The supporting cast is by turns funny and endearing in the Disney manner.  Perhaps that
annoyed people, but the Quidlings, Munchkins and Dinkies are not any more cloying and
annoying than their 1939 counterparts.

The China Girl, surprisingly, is not twee or irritating either, as child actors can often be,
especially in a Disney flick.

Danny Elfman was the obvious choice to score this movie.  It isn't his most memorable
music but it is never becomes banal bombast in the action scenes, and there are plenty
of catchy tunes that linger in the mind but are quickly forgotten once the movie ends.
Unlike his best musical scores like the Batman movies, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks! and
Pee Wee's Big Adventure.  I think there was a missed opportunity as Theodora and Oz
come over the hill and encounter the Emerald City for the first time in the movie.
The music does not rise to occasion in my opinion.  It is not the awesome moment
it could have been.

So I give this excellent DISNEY movie four stars.  It would have been top-drawer had the
script been more carefully worked out.",1372464000,,3561,4.493001555209953

Special effects were of course fantastic as were the sets and costumes.  It really felt like the land of Oz and Sam Raimi did his usual great job in bringing humor and light-heartedness to the story.  The story definitely had a great message and was entertaining throughout.  One minor drawback was Mila Kunis once she became evil.  She just came off as a bit cartoony and wasn't really scary enough in my opinion.  Still the plot was fluid and kept you moving at a good pace.

The CGI and sets were done pretty good, and if you review the extras you will see
basically how they put this movie together.

Looks like they tried to make a movie for KIDS AND ADULTS...instead of for kids
and bigger kids.

Wont compare the classic to this one cause, nothing beats classic. This one had
some new ideas...some good one ...some bad ones.

Here is what i was thinking after the movie: (warning..some spoilers)

1. I rather have flying monkeys that flying baboons.
2. I would have never choosen Mila Kunis for the bad witch part...come on get
  someone not as pretty and a bit older ..
3. Lots of time spent with the witches..and that phoney little scam from Franco
  to get the girl...and Mila Kunis turns evil because of this...hummm
3. James Franco was better near the end...but not as good at the beginning..
  not the right choice for the wizard.
4. The wonderfull people of OZ...costumes and looks were great..but they
  could have added some short songs and musical numbers.
  The little people started a song and dance routine..but was cut short..
  Come on...where's the magic.
5. The witches soldiers could have kept the Original ooo umm ooo song as
  marched, but they improved that sound only to make it sound like the
  soldiers in Lord of the Ring movies....
  So the sound went from scary for kids ...to threatening...hummmm

bottom line...i like this movie...i will eventually get a (cheaper) copy and
i really hope another OZ movie will be made.......there is still room
And working with Blue Screens is wonderfull for CGI but takes a bit of life
from the actors/actresses ...so they do have to work and imagine even harder
than before. The ones that dont....points to a films that won't work as good.",1372377600,,1815,4.674050632911392

At least the Wicked Witch floated around on wires.

Raimi, Raimi, Raimi. You've mastered horror, westerns, and superhero movies, but your Oz does not hold up to your fine resume. It's no more then a children's film; a fun, lush, beautiful, well-acted, respectful (trite, hollow, Disney-fied, special effects-stuffed) children's film.

This movie is clean and perfect for the whole family. It is a nice take on the Wizard of Oz story.

5642147,3,B00BL1BIP8,"When I first heard about ""Oz The Great And Powerful"", I was admittedly not that enthused about it. However, as the release date for the film drew closer I was persuaded to go and check it out.

Admittedly, this is a darker Oz than perhaps what we are used to from our childhoods and the ""Wizard of Oz"" film/books and more in tone with ""Return To Oz"" and the ""Wicked"" series of books. While not a bad story overall the darker or more serious aesthetic may turn off a lot of people looking for a lighter film. That is not to say that this film is not suitable for children, while there are a few scenes that may frighten **Spoiler Alert** (*Most Notably, Theodora transforming into The Wicked Witch of the West)** it is perhaps not as ""disturbing"" for lack of a better word as some of the events/themes touched upon in the Harry Potter series.

The acting in the film runs the gamut from spectacular to lackluster, with no one really being horrible in their respective roles, they just lack panache or the ability to convey their characters as well as they could have been. But I will touch more on that later on in my opinion on this film.

The film opens in Kansas, circa 1905 with Oscar Diggs, known as Oz to his friends. Is performing in the Baum Brothers Traveling Circus as a magician. He does the normal run of the mill magic acts one would expect to come with a traveling circus or carnival magician. But he feels that his talents are wasted, or that he could achieve a great deal more if only afforded the opportunity, stating himself that he wishes he could be like Thomas Edison. We meet a woman from Oscar's past, Annie, someone with whom he was either friends or romantically involved we are not told. However we do learn and it is implied that Oscar has not been keeping his heart to himself as he has been leading several woman along with a cache of cheap music boxes, and a story about a deceased grandmother. (This ultimately being what gets him into trouble.) Oscar flees the circus upon a liaison with another performer's wife/girlfriend comes to light and he must make good an exit. Hopping aboard a hot air balloon the circus uses for advertising/controlled ascents he lifts off and away from his captors only to be dragged into the Land of Oz by an oncoming cyclone.

Oscar lands in Oz, where he meets three witches: Evanora ""The Good Witch of the East"", Theodora ""The Good Witch of the West"" and lastly, Glinda ""The Good Witch of the South"" and daughter of Oz's former King. I'd go into further detail about the plot, but I feel that would ruin the story.

I do think that this is a movie people should see, however, as far as owning goes...that is a more complicated matter. I saw this movie in theaters and at that point, I had resolved that when it came out I would purchase it. After purchasing it, I believe that it is a movie, that at least in my collection will only be viewed occasionally, not b/c I feel it is a bad film, I just feel that it is a film that I will not be drawn to watching multiple times in quick succession. So you may want to purchase it, if you feel that you're getting it for a reasonable price, or you may want to wait til it becomes available on Netflix etc and watch it then.

Now, back to what I said earlier in regards to the acting. There are people in this film that I think are acted well, Theodora, Evanora and Glinda I think are all portrayed very well and the actresses bring each of their characters a weight to them. Other characters, like Finley who serve as comic relief as also portrayed well as is the China Doll. However if I had to list any singular complaint as far as the acting went, I would have to place that with James Franco as Oz. It just seems that he can neither do the ""Oz the con man"" or ""Oz the sympathetic"" character very well. He sort of waxes and wanes and in my opinion at least really only comes into his own towards the end of the movie.

Overall, a movie definitely worth seeing with some good acting, decent story, good visual effects and very well done soundtrack. As far as owning goes, if you like it after seeing it and can get it for a reasonable price, the certainly b/c I think you can do far worse than ""Oz the Great and Powerful"". But keep in mind, in my own opinion this is NOT a movie you will be drawn to watch numerous times in succession with friends and family and will in all likelihood end up being on a shelf a good amount of the time.",1372291200,,4443,4.307416267942584
5642148,1,B00BL1BIP8,That was one of the most terrible movies I have seen in a long time. The special affects made Flash Gordon look like an Oscar. James Franco needs to stick to making spider-man movies and Mila Kunis should never ever attempt to play anything evil. She is way too valley girl.

Obviously someone at Disney was touched by the good idea fairy and decided that this would be a good movie to make...that person needs to be kicked in the ball sack.,1372291200,,584,4.4672897196261685

5642152,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I used to live in the Emerald City.  But there were just too many witches there, and it just rained too much.  So I decided to move south from Washington State to the sunshine in California.  There may not be a Yellow Brick Road in the city in which I now live -- I haven't checked on Google Maps yet, however -- but at least it's sunny about 300 days a year.  That's surely better than raining 300 days a year.

My ""new"" house was built in 1938, or probably the same year that ""The Wizard of Oz"" was being filmed.  The bad things about an older house:  it's creaky and it constantly needs work.  The good things:  it has charm and it was built to last, unlike the houses built today.  And this is about exactly how I'd compare the original ""Wizard of Oz"" with ""Oz:  the Great and Powerful.""  The latter just doesn't have much charm, while the former was overflowing with it.  And this prequel will most likely be almost forgotten in only a few years, while people will be talking about the original through the next century.

Oh, I did really like Michelle Williams, of course.  She's always good.  The only problem that I usually have with her in a movie:  I actually think about Heath Ledger the whole time.  I'll bet the same might go for her.  He definitely died before his time, and he had several roles where he was terrific.  And I really liked the little porcelain doll here as well; she seemed to have more humanity than almost any of the other humans in this picture.

But while watching, I started thinking about the potential that this film had, and I thought about how much this film owed to the original ""Oz"" to be good.  I would argue that ""The Wizard of Oz,"" while surely not being perfect -- no film ever is or will be perfect -- was probably a masterpiece.  And I started thinking about how the producers could have almost guaranteed that this film would have been great.  So let's go back in time and remake this film right this time . . . .

1.  Make Tim Burton the director.  This film either needed to be lighter or darker, and I think that Mr. Burton would have gone the latter route but simultaneously given it more humanity, as he always does.  2.  Put Johnny Depp in the main role.  You can put him in almost any lead male role and it'll be better.  3.  Keep Michelle Williams in it.  She's always good to great.  4.  Beg Charlize Theron to play the Wicked Witch.  Pay her whatever she wants.  She was terrific in, well, every role she plays.  But she was doubly terrific in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" as the Meanest Person Ever.  5.  Make Patton Oswalt the monkey.  6.  Finally, producers, just get the hell outta Mr. Burton's way and let him make the picture!

But unfortunately, we don't have a time machine so we will be ""stuck"" with this, although it has a few moments here and there.  It seemed to be influenced by ""Willy Wonka"" (the original) and ""Mary Poppins.""  And I somewhat liked the themes:  Deception, Greed and Redemption.  Oh, and ""Dance with the One Who Brung Ya'.""

How many times are we going to see the poisoned apple routine in a Disney film? The CGI effects were terrible and cringe-worthy. The movie was all about putting one over on people, lying and misrepresenting yourself for the greater good. The same old story of a handful of people thinking they know what's best for the masses. The public at large are sheeple who need a hero and all that garbage.

Not a great message for kids.",1372291200,,567,4.495145631067961

I had heard it was a bit dark, and so was concerned my 8 and 6 year olds would find it too scary, but it was fine for them. It is basically a `prequel' to the Wizard of Oz, although you (or your kids) don't need to have seen that to follow this.  James Franco plays a traveling magician who is swept up into a tornado (or dream, depending on your interpretation) and lands in Oz, where through a circuitous series of events, he ends up as the Wizard. Dorothy and gang don't figure in this story, though both the wicked witch (Mila Kunis) and the good witch (Michelle Wiliams) do. The special effects are great, and the story, although not terribly inventive, carries along well enough. Overall, it's a good family film - perhaps a bit too dark for the preschool set, but elementary age and up should enjoy it. Let go of your attachments to the original Wizard of Oz, and just enjoy this for the performances and special effects, as an entertaining family film.",1372291200,,1019,4.391534391534392

To this day I still love it as a classic, at least for my generation. What also made me wonder about this particular film were the mixed reviews it was getting by the media. I always try to avoid reading movie reviews so I don't have any preconceived opinions.

I was enthralled from the start! Was happy to see some references to my Wizard of Oz movie. The opening shown in black and white until he lands in Oz. The emerald city looking very much as it did in MGM's version. James Franco gave a good performance as the Wizard, the flying monkey's still as ""scary"" as they were. Michelle, Mila and Rachel as the Witches very well done.

The overall feel of this movie seems to stay fairly true to the original L. Frank Baums Oz Books, which were a bit darker then the MGM Classic.

I am a Grandmother now and I see this movie becoming one of my granddaughters favorites when they get a bit older tyo enjoy a film like this. A new classic for a new generation!",1372291200,,1129,4.193548387096774

5642175,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Digital Special Effects are so commonplace in movies and TV that I find I just expect them in a movie.  I am now wowed by movies that are special but with much smaller armies listed in the credits and with subtle special effects.  This movie has lots of digital sequences, and has several armies in the credits.  I have to say they are well executed.  They are not surprising, but they are fun.  The movie is enjoyable.

I have struggled to determine what I consider to be missing.  I think it is that, ultimately, this is a story based on the imagination of L. Frank Baum.  It certainly captures Baum's imagery and story, and it does so with Baum's evident desire to ""soften"" violence.  That it does this by softening any moral is the problem.  What does the Wizard really learn?  What about the witches?  What does any of the characters learn?  There are probably as many opinions as there are viewers.

So, viewing the movie is fun, enjoyable, and in keeping with what modern critics of L. Frank Baum think.

But, critics have never understood Mr. Baum.  I will say this: he could deliver dead-on sarcastic wit with such kindness and in so few words, most people miss his point entirely.  Well, the makers of this movie did too.",1372204800,,1231,4.5227272727272725

The FX were cool but sometimes (honestly) looked kinda cheesy.  I half wonder if this was purposeful considering what it is (and considering the original movie was a musical).

In the end, the movie was enjoyable.  There were a few parts that had my 5 and 8 year olds jumping out of their seats and the ending was straight up fist pumping, hell yeah, exciting.

I hope they continue adapting the story in the series in this new format.  I'd definitely throw good money at more of these.",1372204800,,690,4.3515625

1. Finley was a good flying monkey. I noticed he wore the same clothes as the evil monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. So, after most of the evil monkeys were put to sleep in the poppy fields, did Finley go bad, and  go over to the Witch's side? Speaking of Finley, where were all the other Finleys?
2. When Dorothy, and the others were walking through the poppy fields, would they have not seen the flying monkeys sleeping? or, at least some remnant of them being stopped there?
This movie was so loosely based on the Wizard of Oz that it should NOT have had any reference to it at all.

Now Disney takes a fresh approach to the origins of the wizard, carefully avoiding any legal issues while blending this with the original MGM Wizard of Oz very neatly.
The carefully crafted ""Aha!"" moments work well. The movie's 3D effects seem to me to be well done, if just a little intrusive.
Its success will surely lead to more exploits of this newly-discovered wizard and the magical world he inhabits.

As an actor his range is limited to  contemporary stuff and he is out of his league for this character. Mila Kunis really nails the evil witch. I have heard criticism of her performance here which is really not justified. She is playing the beats of a well known character and I think any one dimensionality is part and parcel to that character. I don't think you watch a story like this for method acting, it's really about moving the narrative along and the emotional through line so enjoy it for what it is.

C'mon people, I mean these actors were using language that you hear every day of your life in this time. This is a fantasy film. Put some flare into your character! The actor voicing the monkey for example, Speak with an interesting accent or something. Don't talk to me like 2013. Make your character colorful and interesting. Watch some the older Disney films and that should enhance my point. These actors could have better than this. The character acting was Terrible. Go ahead and watch the wicked witch when she appears for the first time in the original film, and then play the similar scene in this film. Do I have to say anything more to make my point.

It seemed like one of those movies where the studio and the creative team wanted different things so the movie wound up somewhere in between filled with compromises instead of artistic vision. Most of the actors seemed to struggle with all the green screen - especially a hammy James Franco - and the script didn't fully work.

This pretty much sums up that whoever has those rights wasn't very confident in the script to warrant a thumbs-up.

James Franco plays a sleezy snake oil salesman style phony ""magician"" in the beginning sequence which is in black and white (somehow I think he was playing himself more than he might care to admit).  Not to toss spoilers, so let's just say through familiar means he winds up in OZ and is deemed a savior of sorts and is expected to free them from the evil witch who now controls the Emerald City along with her Sister, who starts off nice but, well....

The acting is what you'd expect for a movie such as this, and the special effects borderline on Disney animation at times, but along the sometimes drawn-out long way, you do pick up a few bits and pieces that explain a little of the background of some of the characters that were never explored in the original movie.  Kids can sit through a lot... adults will wish about 15 minutes of this movie were cut out.

Overall a ""decent"" movie.  If you're stuck at home with the kids for a rainy weekend I could see making this the first of a double play, showing the original after this one, to piece things together for them.",1372118400,,1497,4.457875457875458

Oz the Great and Powerful, is amusing and witty, but seemingly aimed at a more juvenile audience but was none the less enjoyable to watch. I did think it was a bit heavy on CGI for the back grounds/ scenery, though beautifully done.

I had no issues with streaming the video using a Sony set top media center, we paused to make popcorn in the middle and had no issues resuming the movie. Though I will say trying to rent a movie from my Android tablet is a bit frustrating, if I purchase the rental from the STB, it works smoothly",1372118400,,753,4.1506849315068495

5642279,1,B00BL1BIP8,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie. I am a big fan of the Oz series of books and the Maguire series as well. This story was as predictable as it was boring. And the acting is some of the worst I've seen. I don't know why anyone casts James Franco any more and Mila Kunis has done much better work. I'm also a little disturbed by the borderline racist tone of parts of the show. All in all, one to give a wide berth.",1372118400,,423,3.988235294117647
5642290,1,B00BL1BIP8,"Oz The Great and Powerful is written in a very over the top way where the characters outright declare major plot points and motivations.  The dialog floats somewhere between being incredibly earnest and a parody of fairytale storytelling.  But aside from Rachel Weis, who is kind of decent, the actors lack the gusto to sell such precious presentation.  Mila Kunis in particular sounds out of place with her husky voiced faux New Yorker affect.  Here she's expected to portray a quintessentially naive girl turning into the epically evil Wicked Witch, and as you might expect she fails at both.  Aside from those human performances, the film has several highly annoying CGI characters who look and sound like the rejects from some straight to video Shrek sequel.  In general this is a very messy production.  There's no clear tone to it, the comedy is awful, and there's not even much of a story arc.",1372032000,,900,4.8431372549019605
5642291,3,B00BL1BIP8,"While this was not a terrible movie, it really wasn't all that good either. I think there was a lot of potential here that just never really materialized. When making a movie that is supposed to be a prequel to one of the greatest classics of all time the bar should be set pretty high. Overall, I feel like that just put something together to cash in on The Wizard of Oz's legend instead of really building anything upon it.

The visual effects were spectacular and in that department I have no complaints. Most of the acting was good, though I think Franco probably wasn't the best choice for Oz and at times he seemed a little wooden. The writing is another place where this movie lagged behind. It certainly has its moments and parts of it were rather enjoyable, but at times it felt somewhat disconnected. There were parts of the movie it felt like they just ""forced"" things into the story to keep things moving, but it just lacked creativity or believability...well, as much as a story about flying to a magical land through a tornado can be believable :). I did feel it got better toward the end, but unfortunately by that point you've had to deal with everything up to that point. Overall, I would just recommend waiting until this comes to TV instead of buying or even renting it.",1372032000,,1289,4.5085470085470085
5642292,4,B00BL1BIP8,I really liked how they set up Wizard of Oz by giving us the background of all the characters. The imagery was excellent and the story was very good. The only thing I cannot get past is the innuendo (it was actually a bit more obvious than this) of Oz sleeping with all these women. This is supposed to be a story for kids but this threw me.,1372032000,,341,4.029411764705882

5642294,1,B00BL1BIP8,"Where to start?

First of all - the poor cast. James Franco, Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis etc. All fabulous actors made to look like amateur b movie actors with the lack of direction and poor script.

The story was awful and I felt that they thought they could get by with CGI fanciness. I just wanted to slap them all until they shut up and I had to take two breaks while watching it because it was basically obnoxious.",1372032000,3,421,4.3164556962025316
5642295,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Imagine my surprise, when I sat down to watch this movie with no notion of what it was about (prequel, reboot, sequel, remake?), only to find a delightgfully funny precursor to the events of the classic ""Wizard of Oz"". But what's far more surprising is that Raimi has taken this golden opportunity and done something that simply boggles the mind- he has created a companion piece to 1993's low budget cult classic (and Bruce Campbell's most famous movie), ""Army of Darkness"". This is utterly hilarious for so many reasons, I don't even know where to begin or how to properly describe the majesty of this elaborate joke.

(MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW)
Raimi duplicates several iconic scenes, which shall not be mentioned here, for fear of major spoilers, though I can safely reveal that some of these involve gunpowder and winged creatures. He even goes so far as to throw in some of the old AOD lines, such as ""Hold... hold...!"" during another scene which I cannot detail any further, again for fear of spoilers. Additionally, the stories are remarkably similar, insofar as we have a displaced outsider arriving in a strange land, being hailed as a savior, exposed as a fraud, and then relying on his wits and resourcefulness to lead a ragtag force against an army of overwhelming strength and evil... an army of ""darkness"", one might even say. Heck, he even gets Danny Elfman to compose the original score for Oz (the same musician who wrote AOD's brilliant soundtrack), and he sneaks Bruce Campbell into the movie, as a final nod to his old school fans.

However, Raimi by no means shorted the Oz fans or its enormous legacy (in my humble opinion, anyway). He did fine justice to the Oz legacy, paying homage to that immortal source, while modernizing it and adding his own, humorous flair. James Franco is perfect as the young, irreverent, charming, and highly flawed Oz, bringing this story to life in a way that is nothing short of magical. Diehard fans of the classic may be disappointed (which is inevitable when tackling such an old, revered piece), but I honestly feel that if you go into this movie with an open mind, an open heart, and a willingness to laugh at all things silly, you will have a wonderful time.",1372032000,,2216,4.738341968911917

Phooey.  Too old for kids' fun.  Moved slowly for no reason.  The special effects were cheap and poor at best.

Even with the template of a great movie and great available content, the movie didn't hit the Oz mark.  The movie didn't develop loveable characters or ones that you could care about.  This movie didn't develop individual characters like the original, it developed a society of subservient, pacifist, socialist idealism.

Why did the witches have suggestive lines that described holding bodies close in a kids' movie?  And, why was the witch written as a needy girl with no intelligence?  Was it necessary to go from one extreme to another?

Even after adding characters, the porcelain girl, I still found the other characters boring and cliche.

The political overtones were just as bad (Pacifist Unions and ""the People"" under the reign of a dictator who just had to make them believe to overcome evil).  The People were set as dumb and needed to be controlled with mind games and secrets.  There were no merchants in this movie.

I was hoping for a great movie but, I ended up trying to give my copy away the next day.  That was more difficult than I thought.",1371945600,2,1175,4.6911764705882355

About 30 minutes in I was SO bored! I would have just turned it off if I had been the only one watching it. The acting was so cheesy, the story line was lacking, the effects were poor, there were a ton of ""3D"" effects that were waaay over the top (we did not watch it in 3D--because we hate 3D--so it was even worse because of that).

At first I wasn't sure where it was going, and the acting seemed over-wrought. Thing is, this is not a retelling of The Wizard of Oz. It's more like a prequel, and it's a fantastic, whimsical, technicolor CGI adventure. The strained acting was part of the huckster carney act - completely intentional -- and it was wonderful to watch the character transform as the story evolvesd. The message at the end is intimate, profound, and something most of us can benefit from. It is, in some ways, an unlikely hero's odyssey. Let go of your expectations, turn off your inner nagging critic, and just go for the ride. I will watch this movie a second time; something I almost never do.",1371859200,,792,4.506944444444445

If you are expecting Dorthy, Totto and the wicked witch under the house then you may be a little upset. Still, if you watch the movie for the suspense and blot out the old movie you can enjoy it.

Reading the package here on Amazon, i wanted the 3D blu-ray version. For some strange reason i thought it would include two disks, one for the 3D feature and one for the Normal version.

Instead i got one 3D blu-ray disk and the digital rights to download it to my computer to watch it in other than a 3D format on only one device.

Disney home video has struck again. If you want me to ever give you five stars on here, in eligible letters specify it is only one disk and join ultra violet like the rest of the studios.

As for the movie i think it had stunning special effects and well cast. The 3D was by far the best way to see it. It is a great beginning to an old favorite, The wizard of Oz.",1371859200,,760,3.9802631578947367

Disney would be my last choice to make a sequel to a film as good as The Wizard of Oz... Disney has produced a film for children pulling liberally from their catalog of boring talking animals in an attempt to hold the viewers focus while the story itself sinks into nothingness. The colors were nice and the acting poor. If you dislike the formulaic insults that are Disney movies stay away but if you like Disney by all means see this movie.",1371859200,,539,4.336633663366337
5642495,1,B00BL1BIP8,"I had really been looking forward to seeing this movie. I was disappointed to not see it in the theater, and it was the first movie on my list to see when I had a chance.

This is possibly one of the three worst movies ever made. I think the main problem is the actor cast as Oz--I don't watch TV but I think he's in a popular television show. In this movie, it was as though he bothered to show up on set and say his lines, but there was nothing at all behind the character.  Very two-dimensional.  As a matter of fact, all but one of the cast seemed to be like snotty kids in a school play--the ones who think they're good enough to be on stage but really aren't.

I think there might have been a story line behind this that could have been salvaged.  I'd heard of many of the actors/actresses in the film and expected that it would be pretty good, but my sense in watching it was that they filmed it over the course of a couple of weeks and used the rehearsals in the final cut.

My 9-year old daughter claims to have liked the movie, but...probably only because I said I didn't :)

It's particularly disappointing that this is associated with one of the greatest film classics of all time. But if it weren't, I'm sure no one would ever bother watching it all the way through.",1371859200,7,1279,4.17479674796748

5642533,4,B00BL1BIP8,"I wanted to hate this movie. Not that I'm in love with the ""original"" (Judy Garland and company) or even all that enamored of the whole Oz concept.

I watched it with the same attitude as when I sat down to watch ""Battleship"". I knew it wouldn't be exactly my cup of tea, but was certain to have a considerable amount of spectacle and flash and I would be happy with that. (By the way, ""Battleship"" delivered exactly what I expected, no more, no less and if you like explosive combat scenes, it's fully satisfying).

But this one... I expected to have to wade through a lot of stuff about the characters and plot exposition (and I most certainly did), but once we arrive in Oz... it got me. It was like one of the flying monkeys reached into my chest and pulled out my heart... slowly... while grinning.

It was funny, exciting, had a few lovely twists to the story and the China Girl absolutely broke my heart. By the time the Wizard did his final show and won the day, I was on board, laughing and cheering (which was a little unnerving as I was sitting alone in my apartment at the time).

So don't go into this one expecting a seamless mesh with the Judy Garland classic. Just let go of your preconceptions and enjoy the ride. In fact, I'm going home and watch it again. I need a good cry and a great laugh... and maybe a cheer or two.",1371772800,,1339,4.25984251968504

Certainly the nice transition from a squarish, black and white opening sequence to the CGI-laden color and wide-screen spectacular gets the audience enthused for more.

James Franco stars as Oscar Diggs, known as Oz, a magician and con man aligned with a travelling circus.  During an escape from the husband/strongman of a girl Oz was attempting to romance, he jumps into a hot air balloon.  A violent tornado - the first of many connections to the original film - dumps Oz in to the fantasy Land of...you guessed it...Oz.  Oz is greeted by Theodora the witch (Mila Kunis) who believes him to be the expected great Wizard/King of Oz.  Using a few tricks from his bag, he goes along with the hoax when he finds out that the job comes with a warehouse full of gold.

Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) is secretly hoping to take over the royal role by default.  Along the way, Oz saves a ceramic doll (Joey King) and Finley the monkey (Zach Braff) and falls in love with Glinda the witch (Michelle Williams).  All three characters appear in the opening sequence under different guises, so pay attention.  While all the razzle-dazzle of the visual effects are indeed eye popping, the story falters at times and slows down too often.

I had a hard time really caring much about any of the characters.  As Oz begins to be less selfish in his actions, Franco doesn't really pull it off with his words.  I suspect much of the problem is with a less than great script.  The best thing about the film are the witches, especially Weisz and Kunis's pairing.  In any case, the movie certainly has an audience, even with its 130 minute length.  It is colorful eye candy, but it lacks the music and the emotion of the 1939 classic.

I watched this film on a Blu ray 2-D version.  It has of course, 1080p video resolution and 2.40:1 aspect ratio once the film makes the jump from the opening 1.33:1 window-boxed black and white opening sequence.  As noted earlier, the film color really pops and the filmmakers use every color in and over the rainbow (sorry).  In some of the darker scenes, the blacks are appropriately black.  The audio is top notch as well.  It even has a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 option.  The film is full of audio effects and the engineering is excellent in the home theater.  Here are the special features:

*The Magic of Oz the Great and Powerful (HD): an interactive behind-the-scenes track.

*Walt Disney and the Road to Oz (HD, 10 minutes)

*My Journey in Oz, by James Franco (HD, 22 minutes): A day in the life of Franco.

5642571,1,B00BL1BIP8,"I was hoping that, despite the overwhelming negative reviews, I would find this movie to be at least mildly entertaining. I was wrong. I have many disappointments:

1) The characters have absolutely no depth whatsoever. Judge all the books by their covers.
2) The actors were clich and displayed wonderful overkill at best.
3) This movie is too graphic for small children, yet horridly boring for anyone I would deem old enough.

I could go on and on, but other reviews will surely give a more thorough critique, Im sure. I will say this though: the graphics were well done. Beautiful background scenery! Now, that doesn't make much of a movie, but",1371772800,2,648,4.776785714285714
5642572,2,B00BL1BIP8,"Hello All!

Like everyone else I was excited to hear their would be a new OZ movie! No surprise it is a prequel as these type of stories have become very popular. However I couldn't wait to get back to the land of OZ. I grew up watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Return to OZ"". The fantasy genre has stuck with me into adulthood thanks to movies like these! I'm a Disney child at heart.

With that being said, I gave this movie a real shot! I have to say, just like after watching Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton, I am very disappointed in Disney! What happened to putting good story telling first! First and foremost a movie is just another medium to tell a story and nothing more. As technology as grown and come alive over the decades, film studios have come to think only about the visuals rather than letting the writers do their job!

The visuals in this movie are wonderful and really bring OZ to life. However, the elements I have to say I enjoyed most where the scenes without any CGI at all! This movie felt to much like a video game.

On that note, I have to agree with another reviewer, the acting was severely lacking. I have been a big fan of James Franco's for a long time. I have really enjoyed most of the movies I have seen him in, but this was just not the movie to get him nominated for an Oscar. I will say this may not be entirely his fault as the Character of OZ is written as a ""Playboy"" who turns his life around. This is seen coming from the very first time you meet his character. Zach Braff, I love that he was in this movie because of all the references on ""Scrubs"", but in the beginning scenes, I could not help but to see JD. I think he was kinda type cast. Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams, and especially Rachel Weiss I think were the real people who held this whole thing together! The story was really about the witches.

I would really like to thank Disney for making this film as the story really did answer a few questions as a preguel should. The next question to Disney is ""will their be a second prequel to answer the last question of 'how the wicked witch of the east got the Silver Shoes"" If no one got the whole Silver Shoes reference at the end, then I think you need to go and read the books as MGM only made the Ruby Slippers red because it was the first film to be seen in color and red is far more eye catching than silver.

All in all, I give this movie 2 stars. This was definitely not what I was expecting, but at the same time, I was hoping for something a little more original in character development and plot. We are not all Sheep you know!",1371772800,,2606,4.150495049504951
5642573,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I love this movie. It is funny as well as dramatic and heartwarming at times. I have read several reviews which criticize the acting. I think the casting of characters was perfect. I could go into detail about each actor and why he/she fits the part, but I don't want to spoil the storyline for anyone who has not yet viewed the movie.

I truly enjoyed watching the story unfold and then fitting the pieces of the puzzle together as they relate to the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie. I've watched it twice and look forward to watching it again.

My children are 11,9, and 7. There were some intense scenes with the witch's baboons and the witches, but when I paused the movie and asked if anyone wanted to stop watching, the answer was a resounding ""No!""

The only negative comment I will make is concerning language. I realize that most people are not offended by the word dam*, but it is used in the beginning of the movie and is quite unnecessary. We enjoy family friendly movies and I never understand the need to add at least one expletive in a movie that can do without it.

I would not recommend this movie for young children unless you view it first and determine your child will not be afraid. My children who are a little older, thought it was great.

I love the classic storyline of good versus evil. Sleeping Beauty is one of my favorites. If you enjoy a little humor and romance mixed with a lot of action, then this movie is for you. Enjoy!",1371686400,,1453,4.386617100371748
5642574,1,B00BL1BIP8,"I haven't even finished watching it. My wife has fallen asleep. The acting is severely overdone. I feel like I am watching a high school musical and the popular kids are trying to see how much they can stress the words in the play and overplay their own importance. Delete the part about the musical, though. Thankfully I haven't heard any singing yet.

The effects in the movie look like a 3-year old with neon crayons going crazy on a green screen. Even the depth doesn't feel all that real.

This is easily one of James Franco's worst performances and, to be completely honest, he has had many.

Mila Kunis has yet do anything to impress me as well and I generally like her.

Actually, I am so bored with this movie (as if you couldn't tell from my writing a review of it while I watch it) that I am going to just stop it now. I've had enough.",1371686400,20,846,4.26875

The characters felt very hollow, one-dimensional, shallow. It felt, as I watched, that the actors expected their pay simply for SHOWING UP, not caring about their performance. In fact, the most entertaining personality in this movie would have to be the bellhop monkey. If you don't expect much out of this, give it a shot.

5642577,4,B00BL1BIP8,"I'm not a critique, I just like some things and not others. The story was well structured and retained the elements of the ""Wizard of Oz"" movie, while creating a believable Oz character, con man, conniver, carnival hustler. The chain of events was fun to view. The story before the tornado was, of course, printed in gray scale (i.e. previously called, black and white) like the original movie, switching to full color at the appropriate time. The flying monkeys, the marching witch's guards, all continued with costumes and grunts like in the 1937 movie. A nice blend of elements from the original movie with this back story.

Overall, the witches were grand character studies, fulfilling expectations. The alter ego of Oz was technically feasible, rather than magic. I enjoyed watching the movie. It didn't drag, and was filled with unexpected directions, with a satisfactory ending -- evil destroyed and the innocent prevailed.",1371686400,,930,5.118421052631579

What you think you know or have figured out in the beginning takes a nice twist and plays out well to the end of the movie.  I don't think there could have been a finer cast choice since each one seemed to ""BE"" their part and make the character really come to life!

I watched this with my grown daughter and son-in-law, but we didn't feel let down by the family nature and truly enjoyed it.  I agree with some earlier critics of the movie when it came out in theaters that you probably shouldn't let a very young audience (say, less than 10?) view this since it is ""scary"" in parts, but overall, a wholesome, wonderful Wizard of Oz movie!",1371686400,,947,4.3522727272727275

5642740,2,B00BL1BIP8,"Only ONE disc is included in the package. Movie only. No other extras of any kind.

The 3D quality was lackluster. A few shots within a scene would have good 3D depth but other shots seemed flat. If I paused the movie, the frame lost its 3D appearance. I have never had that happen with another video. The first views of the Emerald City looked like it was painted on a large canvas. No 3D depth at all. Mila Kunis' character seemed unemotional even when saying ""the prophecy is true"". She did improve later on in the film. There were many blatant violations of the Laws of Physics. I do not mean things like flying critters and such. I do not want to spoil the plot but several things happen that would require people to be visible to the ""enemy"" prior to them ""surprising the enemy"". Also, a projected image on a screen/cloud cannot ""see"" someone moving in front of them. So the projected person looking down to their left would not be able to see the movement, yet the character interacts as if they ARE seeing what is happening in front of their face. This is commonly done on TV shows with a person on a laptop screen seemingly ""looking"" at people to one side of the computer as if the they could see them. They can only see where the camera is aimed. In this occurance, people standing all around the cloud screen are seeing exactly the same image no matter where they are relative to the projector. That can't even happen with a hologram much less traditional movie projection.

There was a lot of talk of killing as if it was no big deal. Characters eagerly joined up without understanding why the intended victim SHOULD be killed. There were a couple of funny moments but the major theme was of impending doom and annihilation. I never understood what caused the feud between the Main characters in the first place. But obviously killed people was the ONLY solution. As in the Batman Movies, OZ the Great and Powerful is starkly different  from the original Wizard of OZ. The original Batman TV show and Wizard of Oz were fun, happy and comical. Their Movie incarnations are dark, dreary and full of evil. I long for the days of happy characters having fun and adventures on the big screen. Positive role models. Children that actually learned life lessons from their parents and other adults. I may sell this one back to Amazon. I have no desire to see it ever again. This is a first. I have over 70 3D titles and commonly watch them again and again.",1371600000,,2460,4.486607142857143
5642741,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Boy am I late to the party! As you probably know, Amazon groups ALL reviews of a film together, whether it is DVD, Bluray, 3D or the theater version. So, even though the home video version wasn't released until June 11th, there are already 527 reviews here before this one! I'm sure you don't have time in your life to read them all and I'll try to make mine productive. As I remind those who read my reviews, it is often best to sort by date (choose ""most recent"") to separate a home video review from a theater version. And you can see which version of the home video the reviewer is referring to. This is of the BD/DVD combo pack.

As for the film, I have to say I ""liked"" it but didn't love it. As you will learn from the best ""Bonus feature"" - ""Walt Disney and the Road to Oz"", a new 10-minute documentary- which DOES appear on the single DVD version as well as the Blu-ray, Disney wanted make a film music of the Oz books since the 1930s and even bought the rights to some of them. He was fascinated with the idea. (I won't tell you more - it would spoil the fun). The new folks at Disney went way too far with CGI effects for me and you can easily see the scenes they included for the 3D effect in that version.
Like the Broadway musical ""Wicked"" - which I'll be seeing on stage next week for the third time! - OTG&P is a prequel to the famous 1939 Judy Garland vehicle. And it drops hints of what is to come. And like most Disney films, the main character, Oz (James Franco) has an animal companion (a monkey this time) who cracks jokes. This is not a kids' picture per se though they will like the color and special effects. I think it's worth watching but it won't be a Disney ""Classic"".
Now for the bonuses:

The DVD has the aforementioned ""Walt Disney and..."" plus five minutes of bloopers
The BD has the above plus a 21 minute ""My Journey in Oz"" film which Franco filmed, directed and narrates. (It's more of a vanity project IMHO)

There a 5 minute feature on the ""china Girl"", 11 minutes on design and effects, 7-minutes on makeup design, and 7 minutes about the music score from Danny Elfman.
So, lots of bonuses for those who want the story behind the ""magic"" on the screen.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5642758,4,B00BL1BIP8,"One of the most cherished films for nearly everyone who's ever seen a movie is THE WIZARD OF OZ. Made in 1939 this movie still captivates viewers to this day, young and old alike. Sequels have been made over the years but none have captured the magic that the original film did. But the recent release OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL comes pretty darn close.

The film opens like the original, in black and white and in Kansas, where a traveling circus plays to the farmers nearby. Magician Oscar Diggs, known as Oz (James Franco) has brought on a new assistant, just like he does in every new town, by romancing her. The one possible love of his life, Annie (Michelle Williams), has shown up to let him know she's considering a proposal from a local man. Unable to take care of her he does the right thing and encourages her to do so. At about this time the circus strong man, whose wife Diggs romanced as well, heads for his wagon with intent to kill. A quick escape in a hot air balloon would help if it weren't for the tornado heading Digg's way.

Swept up in the middle of the tornado, Diggs begs for the chance to redeem himself. That chance is granted and he lands in an odd little place called Oz. With the help of a beautiful young witch named Theodora (Mila Kunis), the head to the great Emerald City. Along the way she tells him the story of Oz, how a young witch killed her own father the King to take over and how he had foretold them all that a wizard of great power would come to save them. Oz/Diggs the con man knows better but Theodora and everyone they meet consider him their saving grace. Theodora also decides that the two of them will marry, something that comes back to haunt her later.

They arrive at the city and are greeted by Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who doubts Oz' abilities or claim to being a wizard. She too falls under his spell though and sends him on a mission. That mission is to retrieve the wand of the witch whose father was killed and break it, ending her power.

Diggs sets out and along the way makes some friends who accompany him, one of which he came across earlier. They find the witch, Glinda (also played by Michelle Williams) but also discover something else. Just what that is I won't reveal as it twists the story being told. Just know that things aren't always what they seem. The story takes an odd turn here and changes just about everything and everyone in the process. Just how Diggs and his friends will survive makes for an interesting and delightful movie.

At the heart of this film, as with the original, there is a story of change and of finding oneself. The original had four characters who thought they didn't have the things they needed but discovering that they had them inside all along. This film offers a similar concept with Diggs/Oz discovering that perhaps he's not the scoundrel we witnessed at the beginning of the film nor the complete waste of humanity that he thinks he is. Finding out just who he really is and what he is capable of rounds out the tale being told.

The acting on screen is well done to the point where some characters that could have been played over the top are made real by the performances seen. This would be especially difficult considering most of the film is shot on green screen for special effects. But the entire cast does a remarkable job.

Director Sam Raimi (the original EVIL DEAD and SPIDER-MAN 1, 2 & 3) does a fantastic job of combining eye catching visual effects that make the land of Oz believable while at the same time getting these actors to turn in great performances. He also brings to life characters that we've never met before like China Girl and has us caring about what happens to them. As with the original you'll find many touching moments here captured right beside the adventure being told.

Set before the events of the earlier film, this one could leave the door open for numerous sequels and indeed author L. Frank Baum did write numerous books that took place in Oz. Many of these are free to download for e-book readers online at sites like manybooks.net. If Raimi has intentions of using those stories to build from this one, I for one look forward to them. This movie was one to not only watch but to watch again and again, shared with children old and young alike.",1371600000,,4311,4.455006337135615
5642759,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I enjoyed the movie and the 3D. Nothing special here.

I do want to comment on all the negative reviews and boycotts due to the lack of a standard Blu-Ray with the 3D disc.

The 3D market is minuscule. In fact, statistically it's nonexistent. Nothing we do, as 3D enthusiasts is going to convince Disney to be more generous with their future 3D releases. On the contrary, they might just decide that, for the few dollars they make off of us, they really don't need to deal with this headache anymore. Disney may just choose not to release 3D Blu-Rays anymore. It's certainly not cost effective and if the 3D consumer doesn't appreciate the time and expense it takes to release such a limited quantity of product, why bother?

People are crying and moaning about breaking precedent. Really? How old is the format, less than three years? Not really enough time for a precedent to be set. The 3D market is still feeling its way around.

There is a dearth of 3D titles available. It's a niche market of a niche market. I don't think it's wise to be slinging mud at a major studio who is just looking at financially feasible ways to support the format.

This is a precarious time for 3D. Instead of b*tching we should be buying.",1371513600,,1223,4.515837104072398
5642760,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Ever wonder what the 1939 ""Wizard of Oz"" would have been like if first choices W.C. Fields (as the Wizard) and an 11-year-old Shirley Temple (as Dorothy) were cast? Now we have some idea with ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" the 2013 prequel. No, we don't have Dorothy. But even she might have been upstaged in a 1939 version centered on W.C. Fields. Instead, we have been spoiled by a mature-voiced Judy Garland singing her iconic ""Over the Rainbow,"" along with the less-intrusive Frank Morgan as the Wizard. Had the 1939 film not been so good, I think more reviewers might have enjoyed this prequel for what it is.

James Franco, like Fields would have been, is a sleazy operator as the Wizard. He does improve as the going gets tough, but even his friends still think he will fly the coop rather than risk his life in a showdown with two wicked witches. To his credit, he uses early 20th century technology to put on a dazzling performance that wins the day for the people of Oz. Other, more endearing characters include the china girl, the flying monkey, and the chief tinker. The three witches are well played and help set up the coming remake of the ""Wizard of Oz.""

5642762,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Despite what many reviewers have said about it being boring for kids, my young children loved this movie and it held their attention through to the end.
Here's what I liked:
  A great prequel with lots if set ups in the story line and explanations for things in The Wizard of Oz
  The backstory for the witches was really well thought out
  Not too many scary scenes (the flying baboons were a little frightening, but made minimum appearances)
  The transition from black and white to color was done really well, and was a fun throw back to the original
  The Wizard's small moment of redemption in China Town was a nice little sidestep
  A good ending that wrapped up nicely and was a good lead in to the original
  Loved Zach Braff as the voice of Finley
  Not too many love scenes (although there is a bit of innuendo in the beginning, and the wizard is obviously a player)
  No vulgar language
  No ""gross out"" humor
Here's what I wasn't crazy about:
  James Franco, while likable and human most of the time,  suffered moments of serious overacting and delivered
  a lot of his lines with a stiff kind of irony that almost came across as if he didn't want to say them
  Mila Kunis just felt like a weird choice for the wicked witch, and didn't really come across as scary or threatening

Spoiler Alert (though it is no real spoiler) that Oz the Great and Powerful was not a wizard as professed,
but through years of trickery as a circus magician, Oz manages to change the land of Oz for the better
even though he is wildly outclassed by very real magic.

There's also some backstory on the 3 witches (East, West, Glenda the Good).
I'm not the kind to watch this kind of movie normally, but like I said it was on the plane & I had insomnia.

also has the girl from The Mummy in it. All actors do an excellent job and work together well.

5642766,4,B00BL1BIP8,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" arrived in theaters to mixed reviews from critics and a B+ Cinemascore from audiences. It managed to more than make back its production cost and will be followed up by the inevitable sequel. Sam Raimi's prequel to the 1939 classic now hits Blu-ray and DVD, giving audiences either another chance to see it for the first time or give it a second look in the comfort of their own homes.

In ""Oz: The Great and Powerful,"" a crooked circus magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is swept away to a magical land. Upon arriving, he is mistaken as the mystical wizard who is foretold to be the deliverer of its people from the grasp of an evil witch (Rachel Weisz). In order to free them from her clutches, he must steal her magic wand. Oscar embarks on a dangerous journey to find the witch. He's accompanied by a flying monkey (Zach Braff) and a china doll (Joey King) on his adventures through the whimsical and dangerous land.

As I said in my earlier theatrical review, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" uses every aspect of the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie it can legally get away with. You don't see any ruby slippers and the Wicked Witch's skin is a different tone of green, but believes me that's about all that's missing. The Wizard's Throne Room and even his fiery appearance to others will remind you of the 1939 film.

It's obvious from the beginning of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" that Director Sam Raimi has one goal in mind. He wants to create something new out of the framework of the original film. Raimi wants his movie to be looked at as the ""official"" prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz."" Although it's technically ""unofficial,"" the filmmaker was successful in his attempt.

The cast of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" deliver energetic performances. Some critics have shared their unhappiness with James Franco and Mila Kunis in their respective roles, but I found both of them to be taking their characters seriously. Everyone in the film seems intent on helping Raimi bring his vision of Oz to life as an homage and worthy follow-up to the 1939 classic.

The CGI for ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" could be better. Much of it looks artificial and animated. At the same time, this could be the intent of Raimi to possibly give it a dreamlike or unrealistic look. The colors used throughout the film are vibrant and lend a sort of cheerful air to the film.

""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is presented in 1080p High Definition Widescreen (2.40:1). However, the beginning plays in 1.33:1 and black and white to mimic how the 1939 film started and then turned to color. The picture is clean and shines brightly with all the lush greenery Oz travels through and shiny gold he's inherited as the Wizard. There are plenty of great sound effects and a musical score by Danny Elfman to enjoy courtesy of a 7.1 surround mix.

I would recommend ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" to all those looking to return to the magical land we haven't revisited since 1986's ""Return to Oz."" It presents some old familiar characters and allows the viewer to make some new friends as they travel down the Yellow Brick Road. Although not perfect, it's fun the whole family can enjoy together.",1371513600,,3188,4.6119929453262785

5642778,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I must say that this movie was visually stunning, but the plot could have used another polish or two.  Of course, this movie is attempting to follow in some big shoes, as it is difficult to compete with the orginal classic that so many of us have grown up with and loved over the years.  Still, it is fascinating to return again to the Land of Oz and see more of it than ever before.

Oz (his stage name) is, of course, the magician who will eventually become the famed Wizard of Oz.  The beginning of the movie gives some of his background and plays off the ""Wizard of Oz"" by being in smaller-frame and black and white.  Once we get to Oz, however, the screen expands and the colors are fabulous...all you could expect.  There are also shades of people he knows back in Kansas as Oz picks up companions along the way, and makes a few nasty enemies, including our favorite green-skinned Wicked Witch.

Loved the tornado scene, even though this is one of the changes made from the original story.  Despite these changes, Oz does pay homage to a certain extent to the original, and offers some insights into how things got to where they are (there are hints of the scarecrow and a potential clue about the cowardly lion), but some of the plot was a shade too simplistic and predictible.

As a lover of Oz, this movie is a plus all the same...and I wouldn't be without it.  But as a stand-alone movie it doesn't work as well.  Perhaps, the choice in actor for the lead character might have been better, because I must admit that he didn't seem capable of carrying this movie in light of the special effects and the far more dramatic characters of the Witches and the land of Oz itself.

Could have been a great movie if the characters had been given as much work as the special effects.  Wish it had been.  Will keep it, but I doubt it will ever be a classic.",1371513600,,1856,4.3420289855072465

Then comes a Tornado (it seems this is the only entrance into the land of Oz). From here on, the real story begins. Bright colors, bigger than life world, where life is simplistic and funny and dangerous all at the same time. The one question that I kept asking myself was... ""How does this amateur magician turn into this great and so powerful Oz?"" The answer is quite clear in the movie and it is very believable. A great film for all ages.

Too much skin-tight leather pants a leather bosom corsets. James Franco plays the part of the Great and Powerful Oz but his character is never warm, never wise and always sleezy.

5642827,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Overall this was a very good movie, with numerous attempts to explain scenes from the original Oz movie. Some of these are obvious and some subtle. You need to be attentive to catch them all (and I am sure I did not).

First, the music in the original ""Wizard of Oz"" was one of the best parts of the film, with many memorable tunes and songs that live quite well outside the film. However, the music in this film, even if by the famed Danny Elfman, is not in the slightest memorable.

Second, the transformation of the wicked witch jsut doesn't quite work for me. This is largely because I am so familiar with the original. The new ""wicked witch"" looks at bit like she has the mumps, and I find that distracting.

Third, and I may simply have missed this, but I did not see the set up to the ruby slippers with the wicked witch's sister (thant is,t he one Dorothy lands on and kills in the original Wizard movie. Not that this really affects the new movie, but it seems a missed opportunity.

I would recommend it but there are a few things that I found.... slightly distracting.",1371427200,,1079,4.353233830845771

5642849,4,B00BL1BIP8,"I was impressed by the stunning visuals and storyline of Oz.  Raimi, the director, has created a fitting prequel that really does help set up the original.  I didn't think the sidekicks -- Finley and China Girl (Bowie fans, start singing) -- would work but they are key elements to the plot and Michelle Williams is delightful as Glinda and Weisz and Kunis are deliciously dark.  The movie also does a great job of showing a somewhat parallel structure the original -- starts off in B&W and characters from the ""reality"" show up in the ""fantasy"" world.

On the flip side, There are many dark and scary moments that might give kids nightmares:  the witch is quite scary, the trip through the tornado is frightening, the flying monkeys and the dark forest and definitely nightmarish.  My kids didn't get really react negatively towards them but I can see where other kids may.

It's really hard to believe that Raimi started off his career directing the Evil Dead series.  Quite ironic that he's now doing movies aimed at children.

Anyway, this is one of those films that kids will keep watching over and over, so I recommend downloading.  And, don't worry, that box that the film starts off in, widens to normal view when the reach Oz.",1371427200,,1235,4.675925925925926

5642872,2,B00BL1BIP8,"This greatly anticipated movie falls very far from the hype that was originally presented to the public.  As a whole the actors try their best to sustain some very chopped up writing.  The story is understandable however I found that it was boring in places with much ado about nothing in other places.  In spots there are nods to the 1939 version however even those a few and several are missed completely.  The bad witches are ok with bit more evil intensions would have been better for the wicked witch.  The Glinda character is way to wishy-washy and sugary.  The 1939 version, Glinda, was a gentle person who would kick arse if needed.  This version is the poor beat upon who cares character.
All in all I found this movie missing in many places Giving me the feeling that many interlocking scenes were left on the cutting room floor.  In my opinion if a movie like Harry Potter can run for nearly 4 hours and not be destroyed by cutting then this movie could have run another 20 min. and left in connecting scenes.

5642898,3,B00BL1BIP8,"While the effects are top notch, the whimsy or magic of ""Oz"" is not there. I know it is unfair to compare it to the original, but if you are going to make a prequel to the ""wizard of oz"" about the wizard, it needs to at least have the same fun into transporting you to the another land. James Franco does a good job as the man behind the curtain, but he seems to be too laid back to be a good enough con artist/show man. His lack of wonder at being in a completely magical land and the lack of growth he displays from being a flim-flam man to becoming the great and powerful oz seems rushed. Michelle Williams, who plays Glenda - the good witch, seems to be the only one who had fun with her role. I thought her playing good witch would be a one note as we all know the bad guys are more interesting. But as the good witch, she is at once naive and wise, showing that while Oz is not what she wanted, he is what she has to work with and sees the good in him. Conversely, Rachel Wiesz and Mila Kunis as the wicked witches would have more opportunity to expand and play up their roles, but their performances were uninspired, lacking any real threat just part of the explanation of how the wizard and they came to be. It seems the best lines/heart were left to Zach Braff as his assistant in both lands and the little china girl. Their scenes along with Michelle Williams' were the only ones that pulled you into the movie. Also, the other citizens of Oz were also there as scenery and to move the plot, Rami did not take to opportunity to introduce us to a another wondrous group like the munchkins.

Do the people making these movies just figure if they make it big, bright & pretty that the rest doesn't matter since they're targeting kids? That's the bar for spending hundreds of millions of dollars to tell a story based on ""the words"" of a classic? Are audiences so starved for a big, fun family flick that they'll put up with Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch of the West? Really?

5642920,2,B00BL1BIP8,"First of all the acting stunk to high heaven, and the costumes were ridiculous. However, there was a lot of potential concerning the story. Disney had combined the MGM 1939 movie version, the original story, and their own twist to this updated OZ film. In the original story (WHAT I remember) Dorothy and her friends came across a town made of porcellin/china. One china lady was worried about Dorothy and her friends causing her to fall/crack. In this movie version Disney had added the china town into the story.
Also, in the 1939 OZ movie, and in the original story book, the man known as Oz was in fact a sneaky manipulative person, and his personality remained the same in this updated film. For example, in the original story Oz forced people to wear green colored glass before entering the emerald city...the glasses made the city look green.
Disney also created sets/background that resembled the 1939 MGM oz movie. Watch the original movie, and this remake...pay close attention during the Oz chamber scenes, the haunted forest, and the costumes on the munchkins. You can tell that Disney spoofed/paid tribute to the original film's style/flavor.
 Even the wicked witch's costume(in this movie version) resembled one of the earlier costume designs in the 1939 oz movie. Originally, MGM was going to make the wicked witch sexy(MGM originally planned to mimic ""Snow White's"" Wicked Queen's attire) and they had created a tight fitting black dress, hat, and hood that looks very similar to the witch in this movie version. Also, how the witch couldn't touch water was from the original story, MGM's movie version, and it was in this movie version as well (when the witch cried the tears dissolved parts of her face).
The blending of the original story, MGM's movie version, and Disney's story telling for their OZ movie really paid off well. However, what killed the movie was the acting, costumes, and the strange reactions/dialog in different scenes.
The worst part about the film was the beginning...it felt as if I were watching a high school play with too long of scenes, dialog, and bad acting.
I was never a big fan of the original 1939 oz movie, and I'm certainly not a fan of this one. However, if you want your children entertained for two hours while you do other things, then this movie should work... I wish Tim Burton would have directed this movie...Disney would have had a classic on their hands right now.",1371427200,3,2428,4.836538461538462
5642921,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Oscar Diggs is a turn-of-the-century circus magician, conman and ladies' man with dreams of doing great things like his hero, Thomas Edison, but a feeling that he might not be a good enough person to achieve such greatness. When a stop in Kansas results in Oscar being transported, via a twister (presumably several years prior to Dorothy's), to the magical land of Oz, his fortune changes immediately. He first meets  the good witch Theadora, a nave and emotional young woman who believes Oscar to be the prophesized wizard who would come to save their land from the evil witch plaguing it. As they travel towards the Emerald City, where Oscar will be made the new king and receive a treasure room overflowing with gold, Theadora's obsession with the prophesy and Oscar's charms lead her to fall in love with him, or infatuation at least. They also pick up a new companion along the way, a winged monkey named Finley who swears a life debt to Oscar after he saves the little monkey from a seemingly fierce lion. Through the means of his parlor tricks, Oscar manages to keep his new friends mesmerized until they reach the palace and encounter the distrusting Evanora. Here Oscar learns that in order to take the throne, he first must rid the land of the wicked witch, so Oscar sets out to attempt just that, meeting even more new friends along the way, and ultimately having to prove himself a truly great wizard to have any hope of beating the challenges he is soon to face.

Taking on the job of making an original prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" would be a challenging task for anyone, and director Sam Raimi (of the Spider-Man and Evil Dead trilogies) seems as good a man for the job as any. Amazingly, he pulled it off with great success! Financial success, at least. To Disney, the company who produced this project, that must mean a lot, since their 1985 attempt at an Oz sequel, ""Return to Oz"" (arguably a better film in many ways) was a financial failure and often panned for being too dark for its target audience (even though a huge amount of 80's kids love that movie to this day, making it a cult classic at this point).

Of course, there's more to a film than money, so, despite the fact that ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" earned back more than twice its HUGE budget, is it really a good movie? Well, honestly, it is not perfect, and some of the flaws are pretty huge, but it IS a really enjoyable experience, at least to this huge fan of the 1939 Oz film as well as Return to Oz and various other adaptations.

The problems that the movie has are as follows (spoilers ahead, though you probably know this much already): Most significantly, Mila Kunis, cast in role of Theadora, also becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Now, one of the things I love about this film is that it tries to be very true to the MGM classic as much as possible, though not always, but more on that later. However, whether they were trying to do that or not, if you are going to include the Wicked Witch of the West in your Oz movie, you need to try to capture Margaret Hamilton as closely as you can. Let's face it, Mayim Bialik would have made far more sense in this role than Mila Kunis, a young actress best known for her beauty. Mila has some good comedic chops in That 70's Show, and I've liked her in a few other things, and she definitely gives this role her all, even though a lot of the acting in this film is just okay (another issue one might have with it), but, even with an elaborate makeup job, it is... difficult to get into this version of the Wicked Witch. Mila's voice is just too distinctive, and I'd say that is the main problem. Her voice simply does not work as the Wicked Witch of the West. And, speaking of that makeup job... This is a bit sad to say, but here's another place where Raimi just made a bad decision. He likes a lot of makeup on his witches, but this would have worked a lot better with the first concept, a prosthetic nose and chin, and green makeup. Basically putting an entire mask on Mila just didn't look good. She looked like the sister of Jim Carrey IN ""The Mask"". So, basically, despite some very cool qualities to match it up with the classic movie, which is what every Oz film is held up to, the biggest problem with this one is the Wicked Witch of the West, particularly her voice and her makeup. Besides that, I mentioned the acting a bit. It was serviceable, and the performers have a certain level of charm that you, as a viewer, may be willing to make allowances for. However, I hope you can do that for another character too. There is a character called ""China Girl"" who is basically a living porcelain doll. Sounds creepy, but she is actually very beautiful and sweet, and one of the most sympathetic characters you'll ever see. Yet, shortly after a powerful scene, she is, if briefly, turned into a typically annoying, sassy kid sidekick character. The annoying part doesn't last long, but why do that at all? There were some instances like that, where the modern sensibilities, especially in regards to kid-movie humor, took the film down a notch when it otherwise could have been deemed quite timeless.

Still, that's about all I can say that is noteworthy on the subject of flaws. And, even when discussing the acting, especially choosing James Franco to star in the film as Oscar Diggs, well, though Robert Downey Jr. is rumored to have been desired for the role, I'm kinda glad this went to someone like Franco. I love Downey, but I think he could have been too much for this film. I think there is a lot to enjoy in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", and even if I didn't love the casting of Kunis, I think the other characters are part of that (Rachel Weisz really steals the show as Evanora), and, it is hard to explain, but I feel like Downey's personality is so big that it would have taken away too much from everything and everyone else in this picture. Anyway, can you imagine Downey becoming the bumbling, embarrassed ""man behind the curtain"" of the classic MGM film? I can't, but I can see that character coming from Franco's less enormous personality. So, I'm good with that.

Now, as for what's awesome about this movie, where do I start? I mean, visually, it's amazing, but yes, it's a lot of CGI. It kinda works here though. I mean, this film is heavily influenced by the MGM classic, it makes no attempt at hiding that, and that is really what I love most about this movie. And, how did they do the sets in the MGM film? They were clearly right there on a set. They were often performing in front of painted backgrounds. There was just something so beautiful about it that you didn't even notice it much as a kid, or it didn't bother you. And, in some scenes in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", it almost seems like they are on the same sets! Some of the Yellow Brick Road scenes, for example, and some of the Emerald City scenes. For fans of the classic film, this SHOULD be quite pleasing. It is nothing like Return to Oz, which was fantastic in its own way, intending to be much closer to the books, and much darker. Like the `39 film, this movie is bright, and colorful, and only a few times can you tell that either they had to change something for legal reasons or they wanted to be truer to the book (probably the first one), such as with Glinda being the Good Witch of the South here instead of the North, and Oscar not coming from the Omaha State Fair here, but in an unmarked balloon from a traveling circus. One can assume that if the famous slippers are mentioned in any sequels, they will probably be silver, like in the book (which would be disappointing; they shelled out a lot of dough to make them ruby slippers in Return to Oz, and that movie wasn't anything like the MGM movie that invented the ruby versions). This movie is FULL of references to the `39 film, and most are quite beautifully and loyally done. As I said, this is a great highlight of the movie! it's why this movie is great! But what really sealed the deal for me was the third act. Remember how amazing the third act of Star Wars Episode 3 was? It set everything up for the classic film we know and love. It was the closest the Star Wars prequels got to the original classics. Well, the third act of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is that same kind of amazing. We get to see a fantastically written setup, if very Army of Darkness-like, of how Oscar Diggs became the Wizard of Oz in the way we best knew him from the `39 ""Wizard of Oz"" film. It's fantastic, even with the awkwardness of Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch. Also, as I mentioned before, Rachel Weisz is just amazing in this. No matter what I might be able to think of to complain about in this film, that final act would make nearly anything worth sitting through. I LOVED that part of this film. But, I liked a lot about the rest of it.

Now, before I wrap this up, I don't want to forget to address something. I've seen some of the online reviews. There are those on some video review sites I quite enjoy, who have ranted about how terrible one aspect of this film is, and that's the section, kind of something carried through the film as a plot point, in which Theadora falls in love with Oscar. I've heard ranting about how ridiculous this was, because it happened so fast. These two had just met, and she was immediately in love with him. I'm a bit baffled that net critics I respect would see it this way. It is quite clear, to me anyway, that Theodora was infatuated with Oscar. She believed she was in love with him, but what she loved was the idea of him and the idea of being with him, as he was the man from the prophecy she'd grown up waiting for. She was probably in love with him long before he ever showed up in Oz. She clearly wasn't truly in love with him, anyway, as she quickly turned to hating him. Yes, this was partly due to a curse that destroyed her heart, but it was also because her feelings for him were never truly real. She was like a girl who falls in love with The Beatles or Justin Beiber. She was innocent and not to bright, and she had a great potential for wickedness in her. She was actually very much like Anakin Skywalker, the more I think about it. They're a couple of idiots, really.

Anyway, that's the movie, and overall, I really love this one, even with its flaws. All I really wish is that someone else had been cast as the Wicked Witch of the West, or at the very least, that they didn't use full-on face prosthetics. Nevertheless, I recommend this movie very highly.

Now, as for the Blu-Ray release, I own the combo pack with DVD and digital copy, and though it stinks when something like this doesn't come with a commentary, I do love the extras that are included. We get fun bloopers, we get a James Franco helmed featurette of interviews with the cast and even director Raimi, and we get a fantastic collection of behind the scenes featurettes. Besides that, we get the great ""Walt Disney and the Road to Oz"", which gives us a look at Walt and his company's history with the Oz books and the attempts to turn them into movies. I'm glad they didn't do it in the style of ""Babes in Toyland"", as originally planned, though I do wish they'd done an Oz film in the Mary Poppins style, as probably would have happened if Wald hadn't passed away not long after. Another bonus feature is Disney's Second Screen, which I nearly forgot to mention, probably because I have no use for this. It's kinda like making DVD-Rom only extras. I'm just not going to bother with them.

And, that's about it! Oz the Great and Powerful, it's got issues, but it's a really great film! I'm so happy to finally own my own copy to watch again and again, and I look forward to the sequels. All the merits of this film make dealing with Kunis as the Wicked Witch of the West worthwhile. Take a look at this one if you can, and if you like it, be sure to also see the original classic, not to mention ""Return to Oz"" and the animated ""Journey Back to Oz"" and ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"". And, you also might want to catch James Franco in ""This Is the End,"" currently in theaters (though it's NOT a family film like this one). Now, I just wish the ABC Saturday Morning Wizard of Oz cartoon, based specifically on the `39 film, would get a DVD release soon too! I loved that one!",1371340800,2,12305,4.3577342047930285
5642922,1,B00BL1BIP8,"It's creeping up on a 3/4 of a century since the venerable Wizard of Oz hit the big screen.  In this film outing, Disney has revamped the franchise and created a prequel setting up how the Wizard ended up in Oz.  The movie is a mess.

I honestly have not witnessed such poor acting in a big budget film, it is painful.  I can only assume they were coached in some odd way to present that comes across as stiff and unnatural.  Marco and Kunis in particular or just awful.  Mila Kunis gets a little better after her ""transition"" but all around poor performances.

The film plods around with some dizzying special effects making for nice eye candy.  Typical of every Disney film, there is a ten minute segment which seems like an amusement ride (balloon crash).

They plot line is so hacked that it feels like an endless montage of movies that have been done before.  Guy looking to find himself, gets thrust into overwhelming situation - check.  Helpless people waiting for ""special person"" to come save their sorry butts - check.  Super evil has overwhelming hordes of troops - check.  Witless hero rallies unlikely army and launches assault into certain doom - check.  Braveheart style troop speech - check and check.  Attack falls into disarray and everyone loses faith - check.  Hero pulls it out and saves day - check.  Refund please.

In the end, my worst beef is that the movie just isn't any fun.  It is too dark for youngsters and I think would bore anyone who is over 12.  Not much of an audience left.  The one bright part of the entire movie is the China Town/China Girl.  An endearing moment in an otherwise rancid movie.

Hollywood has become the disappointment factory in recent years and I cannot honestly understand why $200 million doesn't buy a decent writer or director.

Yes, there was a lot of CGI, but it was well done.  Was the wizard lovable from the beginning?  No, but it's not from bad acting.  I don't think we were supposed to like him at first.

5642927,2,B00BL1BIP8,"The CGI effects are great, and the movie is beautiful, which is expected from Disney. However, the dialog is so horrible, I'd hate to see what was left on the cutting-room floor if the final product was the best. More than once I found myself cringing because of the dialog, which is bland, choppy and trite, far more so than usual for a Disney film, which made it difficult to sit through the entire movie in one sitting. I turned it off about halfway through the night I rented it (I rented this via Amazon Instant Video) because the movie was too torturous to continue watching. I don't blame the actors-- the acting was good as well as the casting, costuming, make-up and special effects--it's just the script sucked so badly it put the tornado to shame. I was actually embarrassed FOR the actors for having to say the lines they were given. It was only out of sheer curiosity about the ending that I finished watching it the next night, and was pleasantly surprised that the final battle between the Wizard Oz and the Wicked Witch Sisters was not half as bad as the story leading up to that point. That Evanora and Theodora, the Wicked Witches of West and East, were written to be vamps seemed inappropriate for these characters and the nature of the film. I never read the original books, so I may be wrong about this.

I gave this film 2 stars for the effects and the final battle.

5642954,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Lots of the 1 star reviews of this product seem to focus on the Disney's decision about how to market the home version.  I may return to that topic if characters remain, but in main this will be a review of what IS in the box, and of the movie itself.

First off, it's beautiful.  The 3D SFX were nicely done in IMAX and the Blu-ray transfer looks good.  Oz is colorful as ever you'd wish, and even on the main menu screen, things come out of the screen in a quite satisfactory way.  There is a bit of ghosting in some of the bright against dark scenes, but probably less than in the average transfer.

So, on to the story (no spoilers if you've seen all the trailers).  We have to face it - Gregory Maguire owns this space, and if you've visited the Wickedverse part of your mind will be expecting Theodora and Evanora to be Elphaba and Nessarose and, well, they're not.  Nor could they be.  Maguire's sex and politics take on Oz is fascinating, but hardly good family entertainment.  I think Disney have done a very credible job of respinning this story to make it interesting for grownups and for kids.  It's not great art, but the plot should make the two hours move right along.

Especially given the likes of Mesdames Kunis, Weisz and Williams as our three favorite witches.  Kunis is great, Weisz does just fine with a smaller role that would tempt anyone else over the line into parody. Williams makes the most of what is, inevitably, a bit of a saccharine part. Let's face it, Glinda's not Marilyn.

But, to me, James Franco just didn't carry the Oz role.  I truly expect to get beat up by the Francophiles but really, even tho' he used all three of his facial expressions, he didn't sell me.  Okay, they spent their money on SFX, so let's not expect Depp or Damon.  But I kept thinking: what if they got somebody good from TV like Dylan Bruce, or Tony Starr, or (be still my beating heart) Alexander Skarsgard to do this?

All in all, I do think the ladies carry the day, and the film, and make it well worth the coin.

Now, as to Disney's ""failure"" to provide a 2D Blu-ray or DVD in the box.... I didn't need it, and if you have a smart tv with Amazon or Hulu plus, or an Apple TV hooked to your TV, you don't either.  Redeeming the download via iTunes yielded not only a really nice 1080p transfer suitable for TV or tablet viewing, but also some bonus materials. When is this a problem?  If you spent the extra $800 to get a disc player in the back of the mini van instead of springing for the iPad or Kindle Fire to entertain the kids.  In which case, yes, you can be upset you did not get your DVD or 2D Blu-ray.  But instead of plunking down $20 for those 2D copies now, do consider saving up for a next gen tablet.  It will be worth it.  And, let's face it, unless there is a special incentive like 3D, the days of inserting a chunk of media in a player are numbered.",1371340800,,2884,4.238095238095238

5642974,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I should start out by saying I am an adult and I grew up with the 1939 movie ""Wizard of Oz.""

This movie is obviously a prequel and ""re imagining"" to the famous ""Wizard of Oz"" of 1939. However, while it owes recognition factor to the earlier classic, it is a movie that stands on its own, I thought it was very entertaining and I enjoyed some of the very clever homages in this movie to the 1939 film.

However I could not help but think that this movie might not appeal to everyone, especially those who are seeking more rough and tumble, destructive and violent action (i.e. ""Transformers"", ""Iron Man"", ""Dark Knight"", etc.). This is a Disney film, after all, and so it is gentler than some of the competition. It must have been tough for them to manage. They have to give the audience what it wants, yet they have to stay true to their core values. Not an easy balance, but I think this film did manage to do it to some extent substituting spectacular cleverness for violence. It worked for me, and I applaud Disney.

Possible Spoiler Alert - I won't give away the plot, but I do have to mention some characters to explain my opinion of the film.

The film opens, like the 1939 film, in black and white, and tells the 'back story"" of the main character, OZ, the guy who is to become the Wizard. It's a clever update of a filming trick used by the earlier film by using not only a change to color when we finally get to OZ, but also an aspect ratio change from square screen to super wide screen.

The makers of the film were obviously paying homage to the 1939 movie technique and adapting it to a modern audience. I thought it was clever. For me it worked and I admired it.

The images of OZ are in super color, as we would expect, and much of it does look magical enough. It's very floral. Emerald City looks suitably futuristic and the green colors and gold accents sometimes really pop. I enjoyed the throne room with its ""organ pipes"" shaped green curtains, an homage again to throne room in the 1939 movie. (At that time, Theater Pipe Organs were very much in vogue).

We also have some familiar characters (Glinda, the Wicked Witch, OZ, the Munchkins) but we get some new and unexpected characters who are quite charming.
New Characters Add Charm:

We very quickly meet Finley, a flying monkey dressed in a bell hop's uniform. This is of course, an homage to the 1939 film's flying monkeys, with a twist. Finley is a good guy and a bit of comic relief. He's a well rendered CGI character, very expressive, that OZ plays well with. OZ does not treat him as well as he could, and although he's supposed to be a type of 'side kick' he's treated more as a 'side kickED' by OZ who takes advantage of his good nature. But then again, OZ is a flawed wizard who must learn to be a good guy instead of a selfish con man.

We meet a new character that was not referenced in the 1939 film, but appears in the books, the China Doll. Of course, she's another CGI character, and is also a child. The animation and artwork here are excellent and she is a believable and fragile character. I liked her the best. OZ interacts well with her, and she brings out a sense of tenderness and nurturing in OZ that tells us, he might not be such a scoundrel after all.

Glinda is as expected, blonde and magical, but not nearly as syrupy as the actress Billie Burke was in the 1939 film. She seems naive at first, but we soon learn that she's practical, got a brain, and figures out OZ's con job -- something not everyone in Emerald City figures out until it is too late.

OZ himself is a likable but flawed man, one who hopes for glory, but falls short of being worthy of it until the end. As expected, he starts out selfish, conniving and arrogant, and by the end redeems himself through application of wit and wisdom, with a bit of admiration for Thomas Edison (who was not the nicest guy in the world either, nor a good role model!)

Since this is a prequel, the Tin Man isn't here, but there is a slight homage to the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow of the 1939 film cleverly worked into the plot, there's even a ""Gale"" reference worked in.

So the film writing has some clever moments, but you've got to pay attention to get them!

Action and Pacing:

Some of the action is quite good and exciting, there are times when the wicked witches are downright scary. That is aided by a bombastic soundtrack which unfortunately is a bit uneven. When the characters are talking I had to turn up the volume. When a special effect is happening I had to dive for the volume control to turn it down.

Overall the special effects (especially the flying bubbles scene) are well done and sometimes thrilling. There is a large cast of characters and the 'grand battle' that is such a staple of current films (i.e. ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Hobbit"", ""Transformers"", etc.), threatens yet another 'us against them' bloodbath of fire and destruction. However, the film makers pull another twist. No one gets hurt, and nothing much gets destroyed, yet there are plenty of fireworks and yelling and crowd scenes. I enjoyed that this movie found an alternative to the popular wave of violent battles.

The lesson here is that you can win a war without firing a shot, if you use imagination and ingenuity (and special effects). Not everyone may be satisfied with that, but this is a movie aimed at the family crowd.

The pacing, however, is where the film may fall down for some viewers.

The back story in Kansas is a bit long for those viewers who want to get to OZ and enjoy its wonders. I am thinking of younger children who are expecting to be awed right away. I can imagine them getting bored and wondering why everything is taking so long to get going.

It also turns out that OZ is apparently a womanizer, love 'em and leave 'em kind of guy -- a character flaw that he must overcome (it is an important part of how he gets into trouble with the Wicked Witch). Judging by the final scene with him and Glinda, he doesn't get it, and she should know better.

Conclusion:

I found this film very entertaining and a good rendition of OZ before the arrival of Dorothy.

The color and scenery are good, there are plenty of fantastic things to look at. The new characters are quite charming, the film stays true to the message of 'good is better than evil' and there is good action, and no real violence.

I think however, it is a bit sophisticated for the 'kid' crowd who might want more magic, action, and less thoughtfulness.

It is a very fine effort, very enjoyable, but it doesn't have the stuff of a classic either from MGM in 1939 or from Disney.

For that, I'd recommend ""Beauty and the Beast"".",1371340800,,6664,4.393176279447603

5643003,1,B00BL1BIP8,"If there ever was an OZ fan its me, but I just knew before I even ""tried"" to watch this I would be disappointed.  Ive always loved the original story by Baum, and the 1939 MGM production.  Never much cared for the versions produced before the '39 film, nor the Baum stories he wrote after the 1900 original.

I guess its just something that cant be replicated-Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion.  Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the Tornado of course snaking its way towards the Gale farmhouse is imprinted in all our minds when we think of OZ.

The OZ munchkins, Glenda the good, the Wicked witch of the West, and the Wizard himself all are part of our American dream.  The MGM production was a nightmare to produce, took three directors, several rewrites, injuries on set, and so much more money than anyone thought possible at the time.

This new film was nice to look at, and I really did like James Franco, and Michelle Williams even though I thought they were forcing themselves to make this disaster of a film work.  It didnt.  All the other actors, including both witches were so miscast its pathetic.  They both seemed bored with their characters, and not at all believable.

Its sad that so much work went into this new OZ, but it was all a wasted effort.  I doubt anyone will remember it in a few years.  After 75 years the MGM production is still being watched and loved by millions.",1371340800,7,1397,4.496031746031746
5643004,5,B00BL1BIP8,"First let me say that I am a big fan of the Land of Oz book series and I was a bit apprehensive. But I have to say despite taking a few liberties with the Wizard. ( Who by the way is always an old man in the series.} This movie was pretty darn true to the Oz story concept. One of my favorite parts in the wizard of oz book is the china kingdom, where all the people are living china ( like the dishes ) And Dorthy spots a china doll and starts chasing after her, the whole time the china doll is yelling don't "" don't chase me ""dont chase me. ( also if you did not know Dorthy is just a little girl in the series ) For me to see the China kingdom come to life was pretty darn cool. As to the acting and special effects. It was very well done I did not watch this in 3d I just streamed it to my old tv. But I thought it was beautiful. I think the wizard was spot on, I think that is just how he would have been if he was younger. And considering that this story is based on the story the wizard tells Dorthy about his first arrival in Oz ( which is just a short narrative ) I have to say the liberties taken with The witches and Glenda are pretty acceptable. And Frank L Baum never does go into much detail about where the witches come from or who they were before they became wicked so its open to interpretation. So if you judge this movie in correlation with the book series, I would have to say that every actor and actress in the show captured the characters very well. So five stars from me! This was what an Oz story should be like! Now if they would only make the patch work girl of oz into a movie! Now that would be awesome.",1371340800,,1634,3.8805970149253732

5643006,3,B00BL1BIP8,"If you are a Wizard of Oz fan, you will probably enjoy Oz The Great and Powerful. It opens in black and white the same way that TWOO does and goes to color once in Oz. The characters from the first one are tied to those in the second. The plot is a good preview of what came before TWOO. The outline of picking up three creatures on the adventure parallels TWOO. The thing that I don't particularly like plotwise is that it makes a hero out of a con man. It might be a good role model if he changed his ways, but it looks like he continues to be a con man.

The acting is okay. The mean witches both did respectable jobs. Glinda the good witch was sort of flat for my taste. I think Oz (Franco) was theatrical, but the part called for it so that was okay. The supporting cast was great. The monkey and doll were cute. :)

Anyway, the colors are eye popping. Imagination runs wild. It's a little bit violent for kiddies, but so is TWOO. I found it a bit too childlike for my adult tastes and probably wouldn't watch it again, but I'd recommend it for kids.",1371340800,,1055,4.091787439613527

5643021,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I don't know too much about the Frank L. Baum original stories except what was covered in the 1939 movie.  I don't know if this followed the ""origin"" story of the Wizard that was in the books but I had no real problem with it.  The ""twist"" involving the three witches was actually intriguing to me as unfamiliar as I am to the original material... if it had anything to do with the original material.  The witches' story is easily the most interesting part of the plot and had the best execution.

Unfortunately the weakest part of the film was the casting of James Franco.  He seemed supremely uncomfortable with whatever he was trying to project.  It was hard for me to suspend my belief that cameras and a lighting crew were surrounding him.  It's difficult to root for his transformation, supposedly the core of the plot, because you can't really figure out when it's happening.  Someone Matthew McConaughey-esque, who can play a flawed but deep rogue, would have been much better.

I like Danny Elfman but his musical themes have a very identifiable signature.  From the first few notes to the ending all I kept thinking was ""Corpse Bride"".  Another minor gripe of mine was Mila Kunis.  I think she did fine for acting but she might have used some voice coaching to temporarily get rid of her accent (originally Ukrainian but kind of reminds me of Northeast I-95 corridor... somewhere).

Again a CGI character brought in one of the most endearing performances.  As a character the China Girl was pivotal as a means to an end for a couple plot threads, or getting the other characters ""where they needed to be"".  As CGI develops I think live actors need to be a little worried.",1371340800,,1681,4.631756756756757

5643039,3,B00BL1BIP8,"...which is why I'm glad I waited to see this at home and didn't pay to see this at the movie theater. Hollywood should know by now to just leave Frank L. Baum's other work alone. Nothing will ever touch the classic that Wizard of Oz is or partner up to it, so just stop trying. If anything, someone should make Gregory Maguire's Wicked into a movie already.

They should have also known better because of Warner Bros. tight hold on the 1939 classic which prevented this movie from using certain elements and characters. They had to make the wicked witch's green skin a different shade and could not give her the trademark wart on the chin. That's too bad because a certain house falling from the sky into munchkin land would have made a nice ending and lead into the ""sequel.""

I wanted to like this movie. I really did. After all, it is Disney. And like everyone else who flocked to see it, I've been a lifelong fan of the Judy Garland classic. I just could not admire James Franco as the wizard no matter how much I tried, but I haven't really enjoyed him in anything since Spiderman. The box office would have loved Johnny Depp in the roll, but I would have preferred someone like Lee Pace.

Another problem is identity. The younger generation probably won't know right away who the wicked witches are, not until Theodora turns green anyway. It would have also been nice to see who China Girl and Finley were from the wizard's previous life. Other than their voices, there is no obvious clue.

There's also too much time spent building up to the climax where's there just isn't much going on.  The climax of the movie is well worth it, but I think part of that was because I knew it was almost over. If anything, the movie made me want to go back and read the classics of Baum. I haven't read them all, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who had this feeling. So any movie who can spark reading in us has some worth.

Taking into an account that this movie is for kids, the characters were OK. There is a bridge, actors emulating to a certain level the old Wizard of Oz without becoming overly cheesy. Some dialogues and relationships should have been developed more, as it feels a bit naive and rushed, some a bit questionable - dancing next to the fire, and then what exactly follows and is left to our imagination(?) Again it is for kids I guess...

It is interesting to observe from a historical stand point how the supporting cast is more ethnically diverse in comparison to the original. Speaking of history I found that line about Thomas Edison being the greatest man, a bit funny - looking back from this time distance, and knowing how Edison swindled several greater scientists than himself for his own profit ( Nikola Tesla comes to mind) I found it very ironic as the praise comes from a ""magician"" who is to take the turn for better.

Apart from this little irk of mine, the movie was enjoyable, for those who did not read the book(s) it creates a more solid backdrop and explanation about the characters and the world of Oz, and naturally preps for Dorothy to take center stage.

I grew up with them, watched them with my kids, and now my grandkids. This is the the only one I feel I wasted my money on. Boring begining that does not develope any likability in James Franco. Low acting quality by all actors probably based on a poor script. Some nice color shots but a lot of the CGI appears poorly thought out. Save your money - rent it if you must - but you probably won't watch it more than once. Even though it is Disney look for the price to drop.",1371254400,2,586,4.104347826086957

Yeah, six dollars more but I'm tired of all the BS and whining on these reviews instead of the movie!!!

THE MOVIE ITSELF... Maybe it's different from what you'd think if you'd read the books or totally inaccurate to them, but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie. Disney has its own takes on every story you know. As a movie it was beautiful and I loved it. I see this movie as a guy on a quest in a strange and unknown land (neither of us know anything about it), we get to go with him on his adventures and see OZ before the movie we all know and love.

And as much as I like James Franco, this is not the right part for him. Also, I don't like the main character at all--he's nothing but a womanizing, fake jerk.

I guess if you're not willing to join nor pay over $31.34,( plus tax if bought outside of amazon), plus %5.99 you are on your own. I was astounded! Also the digital copy is restricted to one retailer Amazon, Vudu or Itunes, not two as is normal for $29.99 or less 3d, blu ray, dvd and ultraviolet plus digital copy dvds. I am so thankful to Amazon. I returned that sucker no questions asked. Out of order. other retailers you would have been stuck. In what world?! On top of that the offer for $8.00 off your overpriced theater ticket of Lone Ranger 3d or 2d on Disney Rewards is limited to a measly $8.00 not the usual $10.00 or more AND RESTRICTED TO THE BLU RAY DVD COMBO VERSION NOT THE 3D VERSION. THE $5.00 Coupon they had for preorders I noticed was also only on the blu ray version not the 3d version. I forgoed that to buy the 3d version and that is what I get? On Disney.com as far as I know, and at brick and mortar and other online retailers its $34.99 plus tax and this is what you get? This is an outrage! I could have bought the blu ray version and converted it to 3D ON MY 3D BLU RAY PLAYERS. This is an outrage! I highly doubt I will be doing that.

The opening sequence filmed in a small format 4:3 aspect ratio only highlighted a poor beginning. It quickly turned off the kids and unfortunately the slow start continued to drag along throughout the length of the movie.

I found that even though some of the visual effects and especially some of the scenery was visually stunning it did nothing to carry a slow and often boring movie.

The end was ok at best. The original was something special. And this is coming from someone who does not like old shows or movies. The original had a beat to it, it moved on and kept you intrigued. This one seemed more to tow you along lifelessly hoping for something worthwhile to happen.

As soon as he enters the world of Oz, we get blasted in the face with a brilliant colorgasm of CGI. It almost hurts. I kind of wished the whole movie were desaturated at some parts. The world is crazy colorful and naturific in an Avatar way, but that nature doesn't really play any part other than to bite Oz twice in the beginning (you'll see what I'm talking about). All this work done - all 9 trillion polygons of it - on the ridiculous environment and it barely plays a part at all. I expected a little more involvement, but I guess they wanted to save time.

The plot is decent, and has a nice twist, as stated in every review on this movie. Not as crazy as Departed, but it's a twist. I kind of wanted him to meet some more prominent friends, but the glass girl I guess just hit a wall in their creativity.

Still an enjoyable movie, and definitely worth watching! I feel like it was limited by the more family-oriented rating they were looking for, and that as an R movie it could have really been something insane, but that's just me...

James Franco avoids the Depp/Downey approach and offers a less ostentatious Oz that I found refreshing.  Michelle Williams is a glowing Glenda, a sharp contrast to the wicked pair of Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis, who are delightfully evil.

And watching it in 3D requires everyone in the room to have glasses.

The other thing that ticks me off is that when Blu Rays were first introduced they tried to encourage us to by them not only because of the superior picture but also because Blu Rays will contain more extra features.  THIS 3D BLU RAY HAS ZERO EXTRA FEATURES - ZERO!  Why is it the 2D version or DVD that have all the extra features?

5643118,2,B00BL1BIP8,"Let me get this much straight: I absolutely looove blu-ray 3D films and am totally for getting as much of it as my wallet affords.

Here's what I just don't get (and the reason for 2 stars--""I don't like it""--on this PRODUCT, as well as the reason for not purchasing): I'm an amazon customer living in Mexico who just hates what Disney does over here, which is to sell a bare-bones 1-disc 3D version of a movie (rarely it'll also include the digital copy disc) for a waaayyy much more expensive price than a 2D blu-ray + DVD + digital copy bundle! PLUS, being Disney, it's usually more expensive than other studio blu-rays and prices hardly ever drop--even after years of release dates! As an example, ""Oz El Poderoso 3D"" (Spanish title) is available on a popular Mexican site in a 1-disc Blu-ray 3D presentation (and NO digital copy stated in the picture) for a ""pre-sale"" bargain (LOL!) price of 445 pesos (Mexican currency)--roughly 34 or 35 US bucks--, while the 2-disc 2D blu-ray + DVD (again, NO digital copy seemingly included) ""bundle"" is (also ""low pre-sale"" price) 326 pesos--about US$25 or US$26. There's no other way to get the complete set (3D+2D+DVD+or-DC) than buying both of these separately MEANING 771 PESOS OR 60 DOLLARS!!! NO WAY, JOSE!!! What can a man like me--faaar from wealthy, sorry to admit!--do but order from amazon and pay international shipping (and wait longer than US residents etc) simply because A) the bundles are (better said, ""were"") complete, and B) oftentimes cheaper than their Mexican counterparts even with shipping. I'd bet it's happening in many other parts of the world, as well! JEEEE-ZUS! On a side note, I just looked at Alice In Wonderland 3D single-disc Mexican version and it's 495 pesos--that's 39 US!!! What a joke!

So, it all boils down to Disney spreading the greed disease to the US. My having written this is with the intention that, now that you American residents can feel what many others around the globe (or at least some miles south) are suffering from, you will then add your voices to make this expensive-single-3D-disc trend change for the better. Heck, by now one would think 3D was a given addition to ANY blu-ray package just in case people wanted it, AND CHEAPLY IF NOT FREELY!

Had to get that off my chest. Hope people react--especially you, Disney suits! 3D is now becoming very well crafted and there should be no reason for marketing to end up killing the format, as more and more customers will in the end be forced to turn away from it...

There are a couple twists and turns in the plot that kept it refreshing. The special effects were amazing; I might buy it if it comes out in 3D. The only think I would have done differently would be to have it end with Dorothy's house falling on the witch, well that's my creative prerogative!

I've also seen some complaints about character development.  It's basically a children's story and it is barely 2 hours long (without opening/closing credits).  Again - live with it.

For the story itself.  I thought it was very good.  The points added to make the witch match the description and look we all know from the classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" was very well done.

It's cute and bright and colorful.  That's what you want from a Disney movie.  The story may not be the greatest but it has the typical definite good guys and bad guys with a Disney movie and works with the original movie very well.

I enjoyed it completely.  I had not seen it and was unbiased.  I found the story cute and the changes in Oz touching.  I think it works very well as a prequel to the classic story.

In general -- the movie was just fun to watch.  That's why I buy a movie.  To relax and enjoy myself - not look for errors and reasons to tear it down.

I did have a few problems with the ""digital copy"".  Disney's code for Amazon Unbox did not show the whole code with Firefox and so failed.  I used IE to get the whole code.  Then, even though the Disney site told me that Unbox was ONLY the standard version, it tried to make me take the HD version and then wouldn't let me have that.  A few calls to Amazon's Unbox Customer Service and a bit of a wait resolved all issues and I do have my digital copy (that plays with Windows Media Player)",1371081600,,1680,4.18125

I'm sitting at home, excited to play the special features but they are not on my copy even though I paid for the most premium copy of this home release.

Full disclosure: If I had read the description enough, I would have known; this is totally my fault. But it's clear that Disney was counting on customers not reading the description (guilty) and just ordering.

I found this to be an interesting story that added to the classic Wizard of Oz without messing with the original.  Colorful special effects although at times they seemed a bit to cartoony and green screen-ish.  The story line was good although I thought a bit slow especially at the beginning.

Although James Franco does an ok job as the wizard but is it just me or do you think like I do that Johnny Depp, who is known for playing quirky characters, would have brought more to the role and been a better fit?  As I watched the movie, I just wondered what could have been if Depp had played the character in his own whimsical way.  Maybe Disney thought he was in too many of their movies or something but imagine what it could have been.  No matter how hard the wizard tried to make me believe in him, I just couldn't without seeing Depp in the role.

Ignore all the folks who gave this movie less than 5 stars.  Makes the Wizard of OZ look like a cheap 1 cent gumball. Notice most negatives are from those on laptops. Who watches a work of art on a laptop?  Cheesy! Just because you cannot afford to view the movie the way it was meant to be viewed does not mean it should be downgraded.

It kept me guessing and by the point where Oz met Evanora I had to break out my phone and look up who was going to be evil, because I couldn't wait.  Fantastic!  Also, loved the throwbacks to the original movie, from the horses of a different color (in the field just after Oz fixes China Girl's leg) to the Tinkers (who in the books created Tin Man and Tick-Tok) and the scarecrows!

For kids, this movie has everything, animals, dolls, pretty costumes, action and adventure, romance, and fireworks!  It's pretty epic, in this watcher's opinion.",1370995200,,799,4.746376811594203
5643155,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I almost bypassed this movie until I read that it was directed by Sam Raimi. I am a big fan of Raimi's work and this time he has created a cinamatic masterpiece. I cannot believe I have never heard of this movie before today. I rented and watched on a projector at 720p.

The black and white intro: For those viewing on a small screen, I can imagine your frustration. I agree with the other posters and do your best to get past the intro, the rest of the movie is well worth it. I don't mean to suggest the intro is not worth watching, I was just addressing the people with small screens. The black and white is detail rich, and equally balances with tone, texture and visual appeal. The stark contrast from black and white to color gives even more emphasis to the color once it begins.

The actors: The cast is well chosen. James Franco, the Oz, is suppose to an annoying con-man with little redeeming quality and I found Franco fits this role perfectly. Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis were great as the three witches, with Mila Kunis giving a great preformance. Honestly, I didn't think she had it in her.

The storyline: The story is about how the Great Oz became the Great Oz and how the Wicked Witch Of The West became wicked. The background of all three witches are presented in a basic way. Done as a prequel, the story blends both old and new well.

Cinematography: This is where the movie shines, or more appropriately, glows. When the black and white part ends and the color starts, each scene is like a work of art. I felt like a little kid watching the screen. All that color. I think Raimi's intent was to mirror what those viewers of the first techicolor movie must have experienced. This movie is meant for high definition and the big screen but even at 720p, my viewing experience was amazing. I wish I could view it in a theater.

There is no bad language, no nekkid people, a couple of fight scenes (actors land very hard after being hit by magic) and a few scary, flying monkies. There is a big tornado scene. The Wicked Witch does threaten to eliminate all the good people. However, the good vs evil is well balanced with good triumphing in the end.

If you are one of those people that could care less about nostalgia and just want to see a high action movie with a lot of special graphics, this movie is not for you. This movie is meant to reflect the original, almost a period piece with some enhanced graphics. I feel many teenagers and some of the 20-30/something crowd will not appreciate it.

It seems most of the bad reviews are from people who want all of the DVD formats when buying this film on DVD.  Perhaps Amazon needs to have separate review areas, one for people who want to review the actual movie and one for those who want to complain about packaging and price of DVD's.

5643161,2,B00BL1BIP8,"Walt Disney had a fascination with the ""Oz"" books even prior to the 1939 MGM classic.  He later bought the rights to 11 ""Oz"" books, but passed away before a worthwhile production was developed.  His vision was to follow the original format as a musical.  In fact scrapped ""Oz"" productions(some featuring the original Mouseketeers)were partly responsible for creating the hits ""Babes in Toyland"" and ""Mary Poppins"".  So isn't there anyone alive today who could have come up with a few snappy songs, to complement the original?  Where's Elton John when you need him?  Instead we get just another SFX ladden CGI spectacle with little of the warmth and wonder of the ""Wizard of Oz"".  It's plot is to satisfy our curiosity on how the wizard became the wizard.  James Franco is likable as the fraudulent carnival magician, that ulimately inherits the crown of the Emerald City.  Any number of actresses could have qualified to play the witches.  Franco's cohorts, a porcelain doll and a flying bellhop monkey contribute a laugh or two.  The big payoff battle at the films conclusion pays homage to Thomas Edison and early 20th Century technology, used cleverly to defeat the evil witches sorcery.  Like the even more inferior 1985 ""Return to Oz"", this film lacks the charm that made the original a memorable classic.

5643163,4,B00BL1BIP8,"The 1939 movie, ""The Wizard of Oz"" has developed a life of its own and a huge following of loyal fans. To try and produce a movie tied in with that classic would be a formidable challenge for anyone. As fans will do they start filling in the story gaps left by the movie in their imaginations and creating their own versions of the unexplained parts of the story.

Any movie that comes out will be compared to countless personal versions of Oz and either applauded of condemned based on the extent to which it either measures up or fails to measure up to each personal standard. On first viewing of this movie I left it with serious questions unanswered as to whether I liked it or not. As I reflected on the movie I later came to feel it was better than I was initially willing to give it credit for and began to feel it had merit on its own.

I believe once one is over the initial adjustment period with the movie that it will wear reasonably well; I'm actually looking forward to watching it again since I've had some time now to digest what it was trying to say. Being a collector I'm glad I've added it to my collection and hope to come to terms with what it is trying to say to the viewer.

While it is not what I expected I would be hard put to accurately define what exactly it was that I did expect. If you're a fan of Oz I recommend you give it a chance and see it its message strikes any resonant chords in your expectations.",1370995200,7,1437,4.161870503597123

After you void the warrenty by opening it you get a coupon to buy the 2d version for an additional $5.99.

The reason this is a scam is:

If you you bought the 2d/dvd/digital combo you also get the $5.99 deal but for the 3d. However the 2d/dvd/digital pack is only $22.99 so you will only spend $29 and you will have the dvd as well.

If you are a cump like me and wanted the 3d version you pay $34 as a base. Then you add $5.99 for just the ability to play a 2d version in bluray but still get no dvd. Instead you have just spent $40 to have less product and an uglier case.

Then there are those who are comparing it to the classic 1939 movie ""The Wizard of Oz"", sure to be on everyone's favorite list who watched it, growing up in the 60's and 70's. Fine. But this is a modern take on the Oz legend, different to be sure, but if judged solely on it's own merits is a worthy blockbuster of an Oz movie.

Some are quibbling about the casting and the name of Robert Downey Jr., who was being courted for the role of Wizard, comes up. But really this is James Franco's moment to shine...after all, he wanted to do the movie. Downey did not. The rest of the cast fill their roles admirably. Mila Kunis is given the unenviable task of recreating the role made famous by Margaret Hamilton...but while there is a certain homage to that characterization, Kunis is also branching out into uncharted territory. It may take a few viewings to get used to, but clearly she is having fun and so will anyone with an open mind.

The look of this movie is really like no other movie in recent times. They really could have remade the '39 classic with the careful approach to detail on display here. Kids will get a real jolt out of the story, action, and pyrotechnics. Adults who are not jaded by so many ""event"" movies like this one clearly is, will find it worth watching again.

It wasn't turned into to a psycho thriller, but was a feel-good family movie where the character grows and learns a life lesson in the end.

5643190,1,B00BL1BIP8,"STUPID! And that's what The Beast would say about this film. When I was little, I saw the Wizard of Oz, and I was so awestruck by the Wicked Witch that I made up an imaginary friend, who was also a green Wicked Witch, after her. I am an aspiring writer because of the original film. There are people who go to movies to be entertained (like those who gave this movie 5 stars...) and there are those who go to be inspired by the story and relatable characters (those who gave this film 3,2, and 1 star). If Disney does a sequel, hopefully they will take the criticism they received from audience and critics seriously and fix the things that were terribly wrong.

Here are my problems with the film:

1. Anyone who has seen the musical 'Wicked' knows that the 'womanizing wizard' plot was stolen directly from that musical. I would have appreciated it if Disney had tried something else to make him a 'humbug' than that, considering that it's not that appropriate for children, and also that it's been done before.

2. People act like Oscar is the only Disney male to transform from 'not very nice' to 'good guy' when in reality he is one of many, and the least convincing one at that. What about their first 'fraud' wizard Emelius Browne, The Beast, Cuzco, or all of their other male characters who had to change something about themselves in order to become better people? Their changes were truly heartfelt,gradually took place throughout the course of the film, and they had to face the people they harmed and show that they were sorry. None of which happens in the Oz film. Oz doesn't care that he treated Theodora and Evanora like garbage, and he never admits to the Oz people that he had a part in turning them totally wicked. A mark of a truly changed person would be if he had faced them, admitted that he did wrong, and proven to them that he was a good person. Happened in seriously every disney movie of such nature before this one, but not here.

3. How can you blame the actors for a story and script that was just plain not well written? Enough said.

I am a big fan of the Return to Oz movie, which was better written, had a better story, and was much more creative than this. Regardless of whether there are damaged patients in the asylum, I want to know why that movie is considered to be ""sooooo disturbing!"" for simply showing a little girl in a mental hospital?! I was never bothered by it as a child. I had to take 2 psychology courses in college, which I enjoyed very much, and I want to know why simply showing a girl trying to see a psychiatrist for nightmares is so awful? What is the world coming to when people say that a little girl trying to get medical help for nightmares is 'inappropriate to show to kids', yet a movie that teaches kids that there are no consequences for womanizing..... IS? All kinds of terribly violent and disturbing films with demonic themes were never called disturbing like this one, come out in theaters every few months and get multiple sequels. They are probably shown to the same age group that Return to Oz is geared towards by parents who should take heed of the PG-13 and R ratings these films get. Just saying.

Both the 1939 and the 1989 films were nominated for Academy Awards. Wizard of Oz was nominated for best music, effects, art direction, picture,cinematography, and it won for music. Return to Oz was nominated for best special effects. I would really appreciate it if anyone tries to make an Oz film next try to shoot for an Oscar contender rather than a summer blockbuster.

The script, the actors, the CGI, everything is completely spot on.  I have subscribed to Entertainment Weekly since it's debut issue and have never disagreed more strongly than with the suggestion that James Franco was miscast in this role.  He IS the movie!  He takes you on this ride that you can completely believe!!  He is not going to win the Oscar, but I totally believe that his name will be  attached to this movie in the way Judy Garland is attached to the original!  He was phenomenal!!
Mila Kunis completely embraced the role of the Wicked Witch of the West in an original yet respectful way.  We never got to see the Wicked Witch of the East in the original, but I can't see Evanora wearing those socks!!  My feet would do the shrinky-dink too caught in those suckers!
Overall, I can only hope for a sequel!!  Hollywood is not uninfluenced by box office, so I am sure we can expect it.  I only hope it can live up to the high standards set in this film.

Okay, with that being said, this really is a nice, enjoyable movie. It's pretty good to watch with your kids, if you have any. For me, James Franco was the best thing about this movie.
Basically, if you're familiar with the original Wizard of Oz, this is pretty much a prequel to that, relating the tale of how the Wizard came to be. It seems to follow the plotline of the 1939 movie fairly closely. If you're a fan of the classic film, then you'll probably really like this one.
It's a bit on the predictable side and while there are some really nice computer animated effects, there's not much that is particularly impressive. The characters that run the deepest are Oz and Theodora, but pretty much everyone else you can figure out pretty quickly. There are a few somewhat funny moments, but nothing too memorable. In general, it's just a nice family movie, which probably only kids and diehard Oz fans will want to watch again.

5643211,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I knew based on previews and all the talk surrounding Oz the Great and Powerful that the Blu-Ray would be an amazing visual experience but it definitely exceeded my already high expectations.

I loved that the movie began in black and white because it enhanced the graphics that much more when the amazing color appears when Oz is transported to the land of Oz. You are immediately assaulted with vibrant colors, clear images and characters you couldn't even begin to imagine.

Loosely based on the original story of the Wizard of Oz, Oz ends up in the Land of Oz after being caught in a tornado. Only there is no Dorothy in this Oz! There are many familiar characters such as the good and bad witches and the people surrounding them. I loved the creative spin on this beloved story that made many things like the yellow brook road recognize able but with it's own twisted plotline.

James Franco was flawless in his performance and convincing as the greedy magician whose true goodness is buried deep within and may or may not appear by the end of the movie. When he is called upon to save Oz, pride and greed stop from him declining but can he follow through with his promises? Will the master of manipulation be able to use his powers for good instead of evil?

I don't typically indulge in the bonus features of movies but for something known for it's visual experience, I made an exception. The costumes were amazing so I enjoyed watching Mila Kunis get transformed into the evil witch. It's a miracle the transformation that makeup and costumes can make. The story of the China Girl being brought to life was also fascinating and well worth watching.

5643216,5,B00BL1BIP8,"No film has ever been completely successful, financially or critically, in revisiting the Land of Oz--with that grand shadow of the 1939 classic still strong in our hearts. The fact that Oz The Great and Powerful has done so and become an international hit, is no small accomplishment.

Garland's Oz is indelibly inscribed in the popular culture, one of the greatest of all films. Rather than foolishly try to replace it in our minds, or reinvent it, Oz the Great and Powerful builds on that fondness, expands the story in a remarkably skillful way and melds nicely with the other version. You can literally watch this film and the other in succession and it won't seem like a break in continuity, visually or otherwise.

There is no feeling that anyone behind the scenes of this new film had the misguided notion to make you forget what came before. You can love this movie and also still hold the MGM one in the highest regard. This is a prequel, so you can watch the `39 film after it and they'll both fit together nicely.

On Blu-ray, Oz the Great and Powerful glows like the Emerald City. And though is might have seemed overlong to some in theaters, it does not seem that way in the home environment. Like MGM's Oz, I think this film will become a home re-watching favorite.

Since Oz the Great and Powerful seems to have been an big international success, the best thing is that sequels might give us more glimpses into an Oz that has usually been only in Baum's 14 books. More, more, more!

I would love to have had an audio commentary among the bonus features, but features are still in abundance, especially on the Blu-ray.

These bonus features are on the DVD and the Blu-ray:

* Walt Disney and the Road to Oz
Original Mouseketeers Doreen Tracey and Bobby Burgess, along with historians Les Perkins, Howard Green and myself trace the story of the Disney connections with Oz from the `30s to today, particularly focusing on the film spectacular that Walt never completed: The Rainbow Road to Oz, using rare artifacts seen publicly for the first time here.

* Bloopers
A good feature for parents of small children who might be frightened at the Wicked Witch, since this shows how they are all actors pretending and can act silly in costume.

Blu-ray Exclusive Features

* Mr. Elfman's Music Concoctions
Danny Elfman takes you through the process of scoring Oz the Great and Powerful, which he calls one of the best experiences of his career.

* Mila's Metamorphosis
Another way to show children that the Witch is make believe and the lady playing her is really still a nice person.

* China Girl and the Suspension of Disbelief
I loved the China Girl! She had a nice Rankin/Bass and Bil Baird look, and an attitude much like our little five year old cousin Lydia. Also, the China City is one of several sections in Baum's book that never made it to the big screen.

* Before Your Very Eyes: From Kansas to Oz
Production Designer Robert Stromberg shows how the film is as much done in classic Hollywood style with real sets and effects in addition to green screen, and most importantly, how his enthusiasm for such Disney classics as Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio and Bambi infused the look of Oz the Great and Powerful.

Other features, depending on which package you choose:
* Second Screen
Follow Finley and the magic tricks through the entire movie with select iPads.

* Digital Copy
Using the enclosed code, you can add points to your Disney Movie Rewards and download a complimentary copy of the movie to your computer or smart phone.",1370822400,7,3562,4.6586921850079746

The three witch sisters he meets, two good, one bad (You'll know which one is bad) are portrayed by excellent actresses. Overall the movie is cute, but not too cute, and has some light moments.

Only Rachel Weisz emerges without serious damage to her credibility, but Kunis, Franco and Williams are nearly unwatchable.

5643219,2,B00BL1BIP8,"For the most part love what Disney churns out.  Something you can actually watch with the kids and not have to worry about what they are going to be subjected to.  Where Disney is making a big mistake is with their comb o packs.  First is the digital copy that is supposed to allow you to put the movie on your device and go.  Disney digital will work on the PC you download it to and is not able to be moved.  It is not Android friendly and it is not Ultra-Violet friendly.

The second big issue is that the combo packs are now being split.  Typically there are different levels of combo packs offered, blu-ray and digital, blu-ray, dvd and digital, 3d blu-ray, blu-ray, dvd and digital.  These packages can vary by company.  Up until recently Disney has offered the 3D blu-ray, blu-ray, dvd and digital combo pack at a pretty decent price.  now with this film, Disney is splitting out the 3D and forcing you to buy it at full price as a stand alone disc leaving the combo pack with blu-ray, dvd and digital also at full retail price.  This is absolutely corporate greed by Disney.  It will be my last purchase if this is the business model that Disney is going to pursue.

The REGION FREE set? Hint: it's here: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00BL1BIP8

Now, on to the movie.  I have to agree with others that Franco and Kunis ARE the weak links here. Their roles are played like a Saturday Night Live skit that had only one rehearsal...and neither really FIT the parts. Bad acting of a couple characters aside, the movie was quite watchable, and could have been a GREAT movie if more attention had been played to cast and detail.
The movie looked kind of ""disjointed"". Certain areas of the film were wonderfully done, while other ""3D moments"" just looked cheap and cheesy. Finley and China Girl, were great additions to this prequel, and brought a modern-yet-classical look to the film.  I enjoyed the movie, flaws and all. Not a GREAT movie, but a good watch.

This is a movie that I was looking forward to seeing but was a little hesitant. One reason was that I love the Wizard Of Oz and was afraid this would ruin the mystique of that movie. The other reason was I wasn't sure how you make a prequel to a movie that was a dream in the first place. That out of the way I really enjoyed this a lot. The characters are great and the movie really does a great job of setting up what will be seen in the Wizard Of Oz. This is a really good family movie even though there are a few pretty creepy parts in this. Overall, a very good movie that deserves to carry the title of Oz. I highly recommend this movie.

5643229,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Didn't mean to, but I went into watching OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL with a semi-closed mind, after reading review after review citing the bad casting of James Franco (even though I am rabid for Franco; love the guy!).  Sure enough, Franco was, indeed, a bad casting choice for the lead role ... but, to me, even worse was Mila Kunis as Theodora/the Wicked Witch of the West.  Margaret Hamilton set a DAMNED high bar for the role, and Kunis never comes off as menacing/wicked enough.  Hell, even her slighter height, toward the end when Theodora is playing side-by-side with wicked sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz, who is wonderfully evil), completely diminishes the power of the character.

That's the negative; the positive is the 'Oz the Great and Powerful' is freaking BEAUTIFUL to look at.  Director Sam Raimi has infused the film with all the color, majesty, and eye candy needed to pay homage to 'The Wizard of Oz' classic - and much as I hate to admit it, Michelle Williams (not perfect, but good), Zach Braff (even voicing the winged monkey Finley, Tony Cox (who can convey more sardonic wit with one look than many actors can do with dialogue), and the rest of the supporting cast make the movie enjoyable ... even fun.  Franco isn't THAT bad in the role, especially as Oz gains his footing and goes from con man/magician to realizing his destiny, but through the entire picture he just feels ... off.  Like a framed painting hanging just slightly crooked on the wall, that never seems quite straight no matter what you do.

Worth seeing?  Definitely.  And kids will love it (though it may be too intense for the younger ones; the Wicked Witch's evil monkeys, fairly vicious in appearance, fly right into the camera a few times, thanks to the film's being shot in 3D).

The previews made it look amazing and magical.  But see the film and you'll see how weak it is from start to finish.  Terrible acting, a watered down plot, no real suspense and you never care about any of the characters.  There's hardly even any laughs or scenes that make up for the incredibly dull plot.

I knew there would be some differences due to copyright issues that Disney had to work around but overall it seemed like a fitting prequel.

The problem? Not enough character and plot development. Now they did advertise it as being modified from its original format to fit the airplanes' screen size but also edited for content. I wonder how much they edited out because this was like a short story compared to the depth and development in the aforementioned Oz movies.

==SPOILER ALERT (and not really much of one but eh, be warned)===

You start out in a small town with a magician (Oz) who pulls a Dorothy and winds up in Oz (city). Before the tornado, he meets Michelle William's character and they have some kind of back story but it is so brief that it doesn't truly connect the two of them before he gets transported. Then he gets to Oz, has a mild introduction of a relationship with Mila Kunis' character. Then meets her sister. Then meets Glinda (Michelle Williams). Then fights the ""evil"" (Mila Kunis/Rachel Weisz) and then the movie is over. THEN THE MOVIE IS OVER. I just told you the same story in less than an paragraph. If that's any indication to the entertainment you'll get from the movie, then run with it.

It gets a 3 star only because it wasn't horrible. It just wasn't good. Or great. Definitely not one I would watch again but at least it seemed family friendly, if there's an upside. No gore, language was appropriate, typical of Disney.",1370304000,4,1894,4.943396226415095

5643248,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I found 'Oz the Great and Powerful' a very enjoyable movie.  Yes, there are flaws, but, I felt the movie on a whole outweighed the little things that bothered me. I got a kick out of certain details from the book and/or '39 movie...one being, the horse of another color :)

Like many, I grew up with the '39 flick and had seen it on the big screen during film anniversaries and on tv, plus I own one of the many deluxe editions. I've always hoped that the movie industry would leave this iconic movie alone and not do like they've done and still doing with so many, make a redo. Much like the other big '39 film...Gone with the Wind....Wizard of Oz....could never be redone and still hold the magic of the original even with all the flaws.

To me, Oz the Great and Powerful, adds to the magic without touching the original..it kind of enhances it, explaining how some of the things seen in the original came to be. Yes, it's not perfect, like some of the CGI parts or even some of the acting...Mila Kunis comes to mind, but, again, as a whole, this movie enhances the original. Also, the movie brings in parts of the books that the original didn't..one example being, Glinda the witch of the North in '39 movie is Glinda the witch of the South from the book.

There are definite errors in this movie. Again, the CGI gets irritating at times and some obvious mistakes, like the brush is dry when gluing the china doll and rope/burner issues on the hot air balloon just to name a few. But, even with mistakes, it was still a great movie...at least to me. By the way, look up the goofs for Wizard of Oz '39 on IMdb or any other movie as it appears that really no movie is screw up free ;)

The bottom line for Oz the Great and Powerful. If you enjoy fantasy films and are not stuck on every technicality out there and just want to enjoy a flick, then by all means, give this one a shot. But, if you're looking for a dead on right down to the detail from either and/or both the '39 movie/Oz books, then this movie isn't for you...",1370131200,2,2026,4.251948051948052

The irregularities in plot and continuity were sad and pathetic. Some lame screenwriter dug deep into his/her incompetence to lay out this fake smile extravaganza. The sad thing is that even with wicked witch makeup on, neither of the bad witches were scary or evil looking.

This sequence started with a beautiful, heart-warming scene, but it fizzled out within five minutes, much to the dismay of all of us watching the film. The writers and directors could have done more with this porcelain china doll character but instead simply relegated her to the background as the story continued. When she initially appeared it seemed that she would be the embodiment of love, care, innocence, human warmth, and protection of the little ones, but, sadly, it never came to be.

I wish I had the neuralizer from Men in Black so I can just forget I ever saw that stinky cheese disguised movie. I will say that the script for the movie probably looked really good, because the story was, well good. BUT everything else about the movie was the cheesiest, DISNEYIEST crap I've ever seen. It's no wonder Robert Downey Jr. backed out of the main role after meeting with Sam Raimi. I swear, Raimi's way of directing is stuck in the 90's.  It seems as if he tells all of his actors to act goofy and retarded in every one of his movies. If I could, I would give this 0 stars, but Amazon made me put 1 at the least.

Hopefully, if there's someone out there like me reading this before watching the movie, it will lower their expectations and they will enjoy the film.

5643263,4,B00BL1BIP8,"I guess it's appropriate that the contemporary revival of the Oz saga is every bit as bizarre and beautiful as Oz itself. Oz the Great and Powerful is an engaging, visually stunning, though sometimes head-scratching prequel to the Oz universe as we know it, back to the Wizard's start in Kansas and his rise to power within this magical world.

The story and four leads (the Wizard and three Witches of Oz) are actually pretty well developed, with each character strengthened by their sometimes conflicting motivations and intentions. Traveling with James Franco as the Wizard, we enter a world where everybody has a past history with one another, and we are immediately given this sense. There is plenty of witchy competition and backstabbing, worsened by Franco's semi-romantic connections with, well, all of them.

I think this is when the movie succeeds at its best, though. The Wizard of Oz we are familiar with is not a great guy, and he is consistently not very nice as a young man first entering Oz. Oz the Great and Powerful meets our expectations of the Oz universe with consistent imagery, particularly through the architecture of the Emerald City, the smoke-and-mirrors tricks of the Wizard, and, of course, the Wicked Witch of the West.

The film does not work, however, with some of the supporting characters. While I am happy to say that everybody and every scene do serve some greater function to the story, some characters are frankly obnoxious or aren't written to their full potential. There is more than a handful of cringeworthy moments, and the awkward scene breaks don't help ease the uncomfortable parts.

While wildly inconsistent, Oz the Great and Powerful is actually a very clever and, for the most part, a pretty solid movie. It rises above the disaster of Alice in Wonderland from a couple years ago, and tells a story that is at once familiar and surprising. It follows a story frame similar to The Wizard of Oz, while incorporating in powerful themes of the limitations of humanity and the sometimes disappointing reality that lies behind the curtain.",1369440000,2,2083,4.925925925925926

""Oz the Great and Powerful"" could be the start of a dangerous new precedent - where studios can't give you both the 3D and 2D version, you get one or the other (and if you want both you have to buy the movie twice).  The way I see it, 3D is an add-on premium experience.  Anyone who wants to own the 3D should always get a complimentary 2D version included.

Disney has announced that there will be an insert included with the 2D blu-ray release which will allow you to get order the 3D disc for $an extra 5.99, so it might be cost effective to pick up that version instead.

I currently don't own a 3D player, but I have been buying the 3D/Blu-ray/2D combos with the anticipation that I will purchase the 3D TV and player at some point.  Since I do own a wonderful Korean LG Blu-ray player, that will only play Blu-rays when there is a new moon (or should I say 'Blue Moon') with no firmware updates available, I have to rely on the 2D disc to view most movies.  Also, it is my understanding that creating/manufacturing a DVD, 3D or Blu-ray, is relatively inexpensive for these movie studios.  Disney must not have earned enough dollars on this movie at the theaters, that they have to make it up by gouging the DVD consumer. Let's not forget that it cost $95 just to get into the Magic Kingdom.  God forbid that Disney takes a loss in their billion dollar profits and the corporate executives get smaller six figure corporate bonuses.

5643271,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Loved the movie, one of those I would buy the Blue Ray as soon as it come out.  But I WILL NOT PAY $31 BUCKS FOR IT! It is WAY to expensive for a new release, totally ridiculous. 3D and 2D releases separate too, unlike the others releasing 2d 3d and digital download together at a less price then one version. Recommendation? Do not buy...force Disney and other money grabbers that we have a choice.  This reminds me of the early days, when they released movies, charged $79 for them , tried to make your rent them. Then they lost their shirts. So here we go again...

EDIT:

Well now it's almost half of what it was when issued. As people know, the review should be the WHOLE product. Example? Review of movie of course. But not just that! How is the transfer? How is the sound? Amount of special features, packaging (of disc), on and on.

When originally released, Disney was way out of line with its price and packaging. Now, the price is down to $19.99. Still, I prefer the ""Blue Ray-DVD-Download"" packages. I did see the movie, and liked it. (Mila Kunis on the screen is stunning).  I did like the story, and special affects, and such. The kids seem to like it as well, but not overly so. I did buy this (at the current price) and this is a good movie. Michelle Williams is excellent. Always did like Zack Braf (Scrubs) as well.

So now I can safely say a good movie and worth seeing. A GREAT movie? No, but you will not be dissatisfied with it (my opinion). 3 1/2 star rounded up.",1369094400,7,1486,4.304659498207886

I will not buy this product until they come out w/the 'normal' version like everyone else sells.

5643281,3,B00BL1BIP8,"I saw Oz: The Great and Powerful and had high expectations. As far as effects go it exceeded, this movie is beautifully stunning with the visuals and the sets but in terms of acting, it was a little bit of a let down. James Franco, played an okay Oz, a dubious, ladies man who isn't taken very seriously because he is not a man yet. Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz play out great in their part, then again one is an Academy Award Winner and the other has been nominated several times. Not saying their performances are Oscar Worthy, because this is a studio film. But Michelle and Rachel, were great. Especially Michelle, making the bubbly and graceful Glinda her own. And Rachel, I must say...stole the show, as the conniving and manipulative sister Evanora! Mila Kunis, however, is the reason this movie receives a 3 out of 5 stars. People said she was a ""miscast"" and I didn't want to believe it at first but then when I saw the movie. I believed it! She played Theodora great in the beginning as a beautiful, sweet, and naive witch but as her story progresses, it just flops from there making the film experience a little silly. And at a certain point, she just can't shed a single tear. It was bad, it was silly, and I usually like to feel what the actor is feeling but I remained emotionless for her. I don't want to spoil it, but I was laughing at her and not taking herself too seriously as an actress, and at some point I hated her for being in this. Which is hard for me to say because I love Mila, I've always loved her as an actress. She usually plays cute and adorable roles, this one was outside her box a little and let's just say she isn't ready. At least, not this material. I will consider the fact that she tried to make it her own and she did but their was something so good and terrifying about the original that makes it classic.

Obviously, the original is way better! But try not to compare the story or the plot to the original because it's not the same. This is a prequel to what we loved to watch many years ago! I liked it well enough to enjoy it, it had it's flaws but I think the moral of the story is what makes it ""not suck"" all the way. (C+/B-)",1368403200,,2180,4.240384615384615

The logic of issuing a blu-ray, dvd and digital copy in one set, to make sure a buyer can play the movie across the different players at home, but not doing the same on the 3D version is beyond me. It is not very likely that consumers at home have more than 1 3D TV or 3D player, and then are unable to play the movie in the rest of their home.

Now, this is only my take on it.  This might be a test to see how people will take to single disc sales.  I mean, the movie doesn't even have a release date yet.

If very few or, better yet, NO pre-orders for the 3d are placed, the studio will forget this idea.  As for myself, if a 3d movie doesn't come with a 2d version as well, I WILL NOT BUY IT!  If, by the time the release date gets here and still no 3d-2d combo pack, sorry 'bout that, Disney.

Lets see, Blu-ray 2d & DVD combo case $31.49 plus Blu-ray 3d single case $31.49???
That's just shy of $63.00 for a three disc combo pack...  I DON'T THINK SO!

We have the power of the pocketbook. Let's use it together and win this.

This just in...  at least not too long ago!

Previously, the studio packaged Blu-ray 3D in with the regular Blu-ray-DVD combo pack. With Oz, buyers of the Blu-ray 3D can still get the 2D version for an additional $5.99, plus shipping and handling.

Now, lets see, it is $31.49 for the Blu-ray 3d and another $5.99 + S&H which would bring it to at least $40.00 or more.

Rachel Weisz was excellent as the witch. She was great with her portrayal, Williams and Kunis? mmmm I'd say bad. Kunis is not a hot actress, she is not a good actress (especially for Action/Fantasy movies). She fits more into comedy (that's what ballooned her into recognition after That 70's show). Williams didn't fit into this movie.

Then come Franco, I like Franco. He is a good actor but in this one he wasn't at all. Can't put my finger on it but it wasn't attractive nor captivating his performance.

5643295,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Disney's prequel to the 1939 MGM classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a feast for the eyes with many magical moments.  It's beautifully photographed with some amazing special effects, including the sequence in which several of the characters travel via giant soap bubbles, and the scene in which the Wizard fits together the pieces of a broken china doll.  The sets are amazing.  It's clear that no expense was spared in the making of this film ... and yet, on some level, it fails to achieve the emotional resonance of the earlier film.

I think that ""Oz, the Great and Powerful"" suffers because we, as the audience, don't really have a central character to root for.  In the 1939 film, the main focus was on Dorothy and her quest to return home; in the prequel, we don't have a genuine hero or heroine.  The wizard is a bit of a greedy scoundrel throughout most of the film (and a womanizer to boot); the China Doll and the Monkey are just sidekicks, and none of the witches, not even Glinda the Good, is ever vulnerable enough to inspire much sympathy or concern.  And so, without that one lovable lead character, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is reduced to a visually splendid but emotionally aloof blockbuster.  It's definitely worth seeing ... kids will especially love all the color and action ... but it's not a classic for the ages like its predecessor.",1367539200,362,1353,4.608333333333333

The aniticpation for each showing of the Wizard of OZ was incredible, and everyone in the family watched it together, a much simpler time.

***
Walt Disney Studios, creator of the Blu-ray Disc/DVD combo pack, has come up with a new configuration designed to simplify matters for the consumer -- and at the same time recognize that 3D for the home, at least for now, is still a small but growing business.

Instead of making Oz the Great and Powerful available in an everything-goes combo pack, the studio is releasing the film in a Blu-ray Disc-DVD combo pack and individual Blu-ray Disc, DVD and Blu-ray 3D configurations, each with a digital copy.

Previously, the studio packaged Blu-ray 3D in with the regular Blu-ray-DVD combo pack. With Oz, buyers of the Blu-ray 3D can still get the 2D version for an additional $5.99, plus shipping and handling. And buyers of the regular Blu-ray Disc can get the 3D version for the same amount.

""We strive to give our consumers the best in-home experience and consistently evolve our mix of product offerings,"" said a spokesperson for Disney. ""We know that our 3D consumers enjoy that experience as well as the ease of use and functionality of digital copy. With Oz the Great and Powerful we're offering a single, simplified version for their in-home and on-the-go viewing needs. And, for those desiring a 2D Blu-ray version of the film, there's an offer included in the package.""

**Drawback... Disney usually uses iTunes for their Digital Copies (which the product information does not say)
I dislike iTunes digital movies for these reasons!...

#1 Redeeming an iTunes Digital Copy takes forever!! Up to an hour and a half sometimes where as Redeeming UV UltraViolet(superior format) or CinemaNow Digital Copies takes under 1 minute!!!

#2 Also, You cannot watch iTunes on your TV without buying an iTunes TV box. More money to spend. Where as UltraViolet UV has a TV app on most all blu ray players now that can be watched with merged free accounts with VUDU or CinemaNOw common apps on all Blu Ray Players. If you have a SmartTV the apps are already on your media Hub. Vudu is also on Roku Boxes but CinemaNow app is not on Roku Box yet.

#3 These free Vudu & CinemaNow apps allow you to watch all your Digital  movies on any media device or phone in a cloud. I think its like 6 devices at a time can use the app and you can invite friends to merge their UV movies account with yours for sharing!  Also with these 2 apps you can also download your Digital Copies onto your devices at anytime to watch without WiFi connection for traveling. So iTunes Digital Copies are inferior because they are limited to where you can play them. Its very convenient to have my Digital movies on Vudu or CinemaNow so I don't always have to insert the hard BluRay or DVD disc into my player, I can just turn the player on and click on the app, select from all my digital movies then hit play to enjoy it without moving from my couch or bed!!!.... Check Best Buy or Target as they at times will offer a different Digital Copy format than iTunes for the same movie. I will always look for the UV UltraViolet or CinemaNow Digitals over iTunes!

NOW  lets get to the movie as a production... I will keep it fairly short because it upsets me at how bad this movie was!

Horrible acting across the board. James Franco bland, lifeless and no depth as well as the forced acting with all the witches! The storyline was all over the place, remedial dialog, pointless boring underdeveloped characters(that china doll?...sweet but pointless) poor pacing & a recycled score by Danny Elfman who I just love but no effort was put into an original sound for this epic flop.

I was so excited for this movie but it was so boring and uninspiring. It was beautiful looking though with lots of color and beautiful set design but that was the only good quality of this movie in addition to the opening credits which were very cool but that is it. Opening credits and colorful set production don't make a movie good on their own. Disappointed all around. Bummer it could have been awesome!

When leaving the theater I met someone that worked on the film who did the set design overseas and he told me that Johnny Depp was to play Oz but he backed out. Depp would have made all the difference for the character Oz but still the script is very weak.

If you plan to buy this movie then get the 3D version. It will distract you a little from the horrible production as a whole. The only part I liked were a couple of the 3D effects but not sure how it will come off on a home 60"" 3D tv.

Overall the film was a horrible disappointment and a flop. I am looking forward to Warner Brothers reboot of the Wizard of Oz with Robert Zemeckis directing and a possible Robert Downey Jr. playing Oz. Since Warner Brothers has the original rights to the Wizard of Oz, they restricted Disney in many ways of duplicating anything from the original movie which is why so many viewers who loved the original Wizard of Oz were disappointed with OZ The Great & Powerful. Many restrictions from Warner Bro. were including the Witches shade of green, to her nose shape & wart along with all the other characters clothes etc... Even the ruby red slippers will not look the same in the Disney versions... I think Warner Brothers will destroy Disney with their Wizard of Oz remake by a long shot since they own the rights to the original and have the freedom to duplicate classic fan favorites from the film to having liberty to do whatever they want.... I feel Warner Brothers OZ will be superior!  But for now I am passing on buying this movie!",1367366400,18,4315,4.4045226130653266

It is really shameful that Disney is selling this limited package for more than $30. In my opinion, BD+DVD package should not be more than $25. Packages including 3D BD should include 2D BD, DVD and a digital copy. A standalone 3D BD should not be more than $15-20. If this is the trend from Disney, I will refrain from buying their movies from now. I don't buy any package which includes an UV copy which is a total ripoff and I have to add packages like this to that list.

5643325,5,B00BL1BIP8,"This film is easily among the best I have seen in my lifetime. It is everything I stated it to be in my title to this review. The way they worked in elements of foreshadowing of what may come to be(which is done in a creative way so that if they were to do a sequel, and I PRAY they do, that they could either tell another new tale that fits between this story and the original ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" movie[or the even better, in my opinion, ""THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ""
book] or just jump right into what I assume would be a reimagining of the first tale in Baum's ""OZ"" series) is truly masterful storytelling! This movie is just so full of everything! It has, at its heart, a beautiful story
about love, compassion, hope, and courage(all
the while making a very profound statement that there is more to a person than meets the eye when it comes to realizing his ""greatness"", and that sometimes that very person is the last one to see it; and if or when he comes to this realization and sees himself as he truly is instead of who he falsely relegated himself to being, he can find his self-worth and do truly ""great"" things, even if those things weren't what he had envisioned for himself and his future; thus finding true happiness). All that being said, this is one heck of a fun movie! It has thrills and more than a few chills! It truly is genre-bending. Yes, at its core it is a ""FANTASY"" film. And I guess that maybe that is all you could call it IF you call a movie that includes elements of horror & suspense mixed with comedy, drama, action, and a dose of romance for good measure to be labeled as simply ""FANTASY"". The rollercoaster ride you go on with ""OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL"" is full of twists and turns, loops and corkscrews! One minute you're laughing, and BAM! Just like that, you're jumping out of your seat with startling fear! Or, you may be gripping your seat, gritting your teeth, and squinching your eyes as you watch on in breathless anticipation during a frightful action sequence, only to suddenly relax that death-grip you have
on your armrest and feel your jaw literally drop and your eyes widen in amazement as you gape in awe at the wonderously imaginitive scenery of serene and baffling beauty that is now a visual, auditory, and stunningly mind-blowing feast for the senses! As your breathing steadies and the giddiness begins to wind down, you are now treated to a delightfully charming scene that ranges from witty dialogue and banter to downright gut-busting humor that leaves you wiping a tear from your eye from having laughed so hard. Next up, for your viewing experience, be prepared to ponder and let the story just wash over you as you are treated to some of the most moving cinematic moments one could ever hope for. This is where you might be wiping away those tears again, if not from your love of the characters and their predicaments(which are presented in an honest, beautiful, and meaningful manner, never trying too hard to pry the tears from our eyes in a ""tear-jerker"" sort of way- this is where the major drama comes in), then a few tears may be shed for the moments of romance, that whether most men admit or not, can push those emotional buttons that can moisten even the dryest of eyes and soften even tje hardest of hearts. Now, prepare to experience ALL of that over and over again(only in varrying order). Yep, this movie is packed with  all of the elements that can, any one of them(action & adventure, comedy, romance, etc) make for an entertaining film. It's just that you get the ""All-in-One"" experience with this movie. The story is AMAZING due to the perfectly paced and wonderfully diverse plot elements and themes that are presented, having something for everyone to enjoy! The acting is fantastic all the way around, from James Franco's portrayal of OZ- done with dynamism and gusto(he is clearly enjoying himself here) to Mila Kunis' wonderfully eccentric performance that captures her character's(and I won't spoil just who that is for those who haven't seen or heard about it yet)somewhat unstable, but truly
tender, caring, loving, yet emotionally naive traits(that last one having a TREMENDOUS affect on her character's arc in the story). Everyone involved with this picture- director, producers, actors, special effects studios, et al- ALL did an
excellent job. Finally, it is the special effects guys
and gals that I would like to give my ENORMOUS
thanks! Without these special people, a movie
like this could never be made, and especially not
made with the INCREDIBLE talent that shines
through in this film, really bringing you into OZ
and OZ out to you! I say this because aside from
the ""normal special effects"" being amazing  the 3D in ""OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL"" is truly a
sight to behold! It is as good, if not better than any other 3D movie I have seen...EVER! And I have probably seen about every 3D movie to date. My brother & I have amassed a collection of Blu-ray 3D movies that is gargantuan in
nature! We have nearly every single one that
had been released to date. And the ones that
are still at the theaters or just haven't been
released on Blu-ray 3D yet, such as this one, we
have seen those too & anxiously await the good
ones when they are released on Blu-ray 3D
format. We saw ""OZ"" in IMAX 3D, which is THE
BEST way to expetience a 3D movie. The only
thing that compares(and maybe even surpasses
in some ways) is watching a Blu-ray 3D
film(particularly one that excells in all its 3D
aspects, both ""positive"" & ""negative"" parallax-
also known as ""in-screen effects"" &
""out-of-screen effects"" AKA: ""Depth"" & ""Pop"", as well as having little or no ""ghosting"" or ""cross-talk"" or ""banding"" or ""edge enhancement"", and having an overall extremely sharp, colorful, crystal-clear picture) on a tv that exemplifies all
of these things. My brother's 55"" LED LG 3D TV
qualifies. I am only pointing this out because
how good a movie looks, particularly when it
comes to 3D, depends highly on what kind of 3D
tv you are watching it on. Other aspects such as
lighting in the room(it should be as pitch-black
as possible) can also be variables that affect
your 3D viewing experience. As I stated earlier,
my brother and I saw ""OZ"" in IMAX 3D. If you
hear from someone that they saw this in 3D and
 it wasn't that great(3D wise), ask them if they
saw it in ""regular"" 3D or ""REAL-D"" 3D. Odds are that they did. Now, I have heard only good
things about this movie's 3D quality in ALL its 3D
theatrical forms of viewing. But people who saw
it in both ""REAL-D"" 3D & IMAX 3D have all said
that IMAX is the best. I'm saying all of this because I assume that if you are on this page and looking at reviews for ""OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL"" Blu-ray 3D, that you are considering buying it. I just want to give you an idea of what you are in for in terms of the movie itself, but also of the technical aspects. I have watched a movie at the IMAX 3D & then watched the same movie at home on the LG and the viewing experience has almost always been identical in 3D & picture quality- a few movies looked even BETTER at home on the LG(if you are debating on getting a 3D tv, I would say difinitively ""YES, GET ONE""; but get the BEST one out there right now, and that would be the one my brother bought; after doing extensive research and comparing the different 3D tvs with our own eyes, we found that ""passive lens"" technology is better than""active or shutter lens"" technology. All theaters use passive lens technology screens and glasses- even IMAX has converted from active to passive. Even still, if you decide to go with passive, not all passive tvs are equal. I would advise doing your own research and trying out the different kinds for yourself. But I would HIGHLY recommend the 55"" LED LG 3D TV). But the experience of watching the ""OZ"" movie at the IMAX 3D and feeling TOTALLY immersed with the perfect combination of ""pop"" & ""depth"", I can't wait to experience that incredible feeling and watch the AWESOME that is ""OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL"" 3D!",1366675200,4,8019,4.528965517241379

Regardless of how this film is being marketed, the film itself was wonderful.  I had the pleasure of reading the Oz books and the friend who accompanied me to the film did not and we both enjoyed it immensely.

5643330,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Oz fans: how well do you remember the thrilling world of the original 1939 film?  Was your favorite part the amazingly realized world of L. Frank Baum's novel, done entirely without CGI?  Perhaps it was the gentle, subtle, Carroll-like satire it had?  Or maybe Judy Garland's career-defining performance as Dorothy?  How would you see all of that come together again in a new Oz film?  Assuming you answered ""Heck, yeah!"", the good news is that Oz: The Great and Powerful has all of that.  The bad news is that it contains a significantly smaller dose of each.

 To its credit, the film is not a thin parody of the classic it was based on.  Many reboots of beloved films often take on a slightly cynical bent, paying lip service to their inspiration, but also putting on a thinly-veiled mockery of it.  ""Isn't it cute how innocent and earnest these old movies used to be?"", they seem to ask.  Director Sam Raimi (The Spiderman Trilogy) thankfully avoids this entirely - the new Oz is clearly in love with the old.  This is seen no clearer than in the opening ten minutes - the film begins in black-and-white in a 4:3 aspect ratio, before becoming a fully colored fullscreen when the story reaches Oz.  Not only does this mirror the first film, but it also acts as an effective homage to Hollywood's golden age.

 We're quickly introduced to our hero, Oscar ""My friends call me Oz"" Diggs.  Oscar is a sleazy stage magician, who happens to moonlight as a heartbreaker.  Likeable, right?  Unfortunately, James Franco is neither charming enough to make us like him despite this, nor is he particularly convincing at it anyway.  He over-acts when he should under-act, and he does it a lot.  Ironically, Franco is at his most convincing when playing his stage magician persona, where his hammy performance is actually intended.  After wishing to become a great man (incidentally, something you should never do if you don't want the General Film Law of Protagonist Motivations to suck you into a dangerous adventure), Oscar is brought to Oz in a spectacular sequence by tornado.  The cinematography here is wonderful, quickly immersing us in the fantastic world of Oz without being disorienting or overwhelming.

 Oscar meets the witch Theodora (played by Mila Kunis), and quickly learns he is prophecied to be a wizard come to save Oz from destruction.  The opportunistic conman that he is, Oscar accepts this title, and, bafflingly quickly, manages to romance Theodora.  While Mila Kunis is an excellent actor, she's clearly out of her element in the land of Oz, and later plot developments only serve to make this more obvious.  While saying more would venture into spoiler territory, the film destroys the potentially interesting character developments she begins to go through in an uninteresting second-act twist.

 And that is largely the source of the film's problems.  Raimi's vision of Oz is spectacular, and the supporting cast is strong, but Franco and Kunis simply aren't the likeable main cast a film like this needs.  Judy Garland provided an excellent role in the first Oz, not just because of the skill of her performance, but because the audience identified with her.  She was a stranger in a very strange land, just like the audience, and that helped to center the movie.  Oz: The Great and Powerful, unfortunately, does not have its own Judy Garland.  Franco simply comes off as a charicature at times, and Kunis has been forced into a role that doesn't suit her.

 In the end, it's a coin toss whether any one movie-goer will find this to be a worthwhile Friday night.  I enjoyed it, but that may have been from comparing it to the even more mediocre Jack the Giant Slayer.  This is a very visual movie, and begs to be seen in 3D.  Otherwise, it's most likely a rental.

IMPORTANT NOTE: While I viewed and enjoyed the film, I did not purchase a DVD copy for myself, and thus cannot comment on the quality of the tangible item.  As many reviewers have stated, there does not appear to be a 2D/3D combo pack, and that should be taken into consideration before one makes a purchase.",1366588800,3,4093,4.7571022727272725

5643333,1,B00BL1BIP8,"I came onto this product page with every intention of buying Oz the Great and Powerful (3D Blu-ray + 2D Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy), seeing as nearly every single movie in 3D offers this option when it is about to be released on BR (for the people who are not interested in 3D, other options - BR/DVD/Digital Copy, or BR/DVD, or DVD - are usually available).

And what do I find?

Either I buy:
(1) 3D BR/Digital Copy for 31.32 approx, as of 4/22, or
(2) 2D BR/DVD/Digital Copy for 31.49 approx. as of 4/22

If I wanted the version I came looking for (which, from what I've seen, is what most people interested in the 3D option purchase), then I would have to buy both (1) and (2), putting my purchase at nearly 63 USD.

Instead, what I will do is spend 0.0 USD, and rent this movie when it comes out.

So, Disney, congratulations on losing a sale due to greed.

Some family members just don't like watching 3D movies while others prefer watching them in their own rooms.

Thank you Amazon for offering your review forums which allow folks to make informed decisions before shelling out top dollar for significantly less product than what the studio has previously offered.  Not only will I not be buying this product, but, if this trend continues, I will not be upgrading anymore of my Disney movies to 3D (or Blu-ray for that matter).  If Disney's (and any studios who follow suit) goal is to bring sales of 3D TVs, glasses, players, and movies to a screeching halt, then keep going in the 3D only/full price direction.  3D at home is already too expensive and somewhat of a niche market.

WARNING: ***SPOILER ALERT*** Some things discussed in this review could potentially spoil some of the film for those who have not yet seen it.  Therefore, if you have not seen it, read onward at your own choice.

Okay, first thing is first: This review is NOT about the packaging decisions made by Disney for this set or their decision to sell the 3D version separately.  I agree with most that it is corporate greed and is quite despicable, but that is not what I am here to review because most everyone can come to that conclusion themselves without people ranting about it endlessly in the reviews.  No, this review is an actual critique of the film, so if you are here to get a sense of whether the film's (and thus this set's) actual content is something you're interested in, this review is for you.  Naturally, I saw the film in theaters and am writing this review based upon my viewing of the film and observations made during that viewing.  I shall attempt to go over the positives and negatives associated with the film in a fair way that can allow others who have not yet seen the film to draw their own conclusions from hopefully.

Before I get into specifics, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize that, given the material the film is coming from and the ENORMOUS shadow it had to work in from the 1939 film, one should not judge this film overly harshly.  I think we all know that no Oz film is going to ever fully eclipse the much-beloved and universally cherished 1939 film with Judy Garland and Margaret Hamilton.  Hence, to even try to overcome such a monumental production is a fool's errand, but so too is the idea of judging any new effort to reboot the Oz saga by comparison to the 1939 film alone.  I myself have been a lifelong lover of the 1939 film, ever since I was a small child, and it remains one of the most beloved movies in my collection to this day.  I came into this film knowing going in that it would not likely overcome the sheer splendor and magic of the 1939 film, but I also came into it with an open mind and a curiosity to see how they could potentially bring the Oz story into the 21st century.  This is how I would suggest all who have not seen it yet to go into it: go in with an open mind and with no preconceptions about the film as best you can.

PROS:

1) BRIDGING IDEAS FROM THE 1939 FILM WITH IDEAS FROM THE BOOKS:  This film did an excellent job of paying homage to the original 1939 film in several ways (i.e. scenes in Kansas were in black and white while Oz was in full color, hints at Dorothy Gale's heritage and eventual coming, the presence and familial relation of the Wicked Witch of the West and the Wicked Witch of the East, foreshadowing the Wicked Witch of the West's weakness to water, the classic green-skin variation of the Wicked Witch of the West's look made popular by Margaret Hamilton, Glinda's use of bubbles for transportation, foreshadowing the presence of Dorothy Gale's three friends in Oz, the Wizard's illusions that allowed him to use a projection of his head to speak with authority, etc.) while also addressing several things that were absent from the 1939 film and yet present in the original novels (i.e. Dainty China Country, mentioning of the former King of Oz, Quadlings, Winkies, etc.)

2) ACTING:  This is something that cuts both ways, as some actors/actresses were well-suited to their roles going in, while others clearly needed some time to grow into their roles.  Examples of the former include Mila Kunis and Rachel Weiz, who give absolutely stunning performances as the Wicked Witch of the West (Theodora) and the Wicked Witch of the East (Evanora) respectively.  I must take my hat off to Mila Kunis especially, who had HUGE shoes to fill in taking on the role of Theodora, the eventual Wicked Witch of the West, a role which had previously been immortalized by the performance of Margaret Hamilton in the 1939 classic.  Kunis put a stupendous modern spin on the character while also paying homage to the foundations for the character that were laid by Margaret Hamilton more than 70 years ago, portraying Theodora in a way many girls like her today could empathize with initially while eventually transitioning her into the classic green-skinned Wicked Witch of the West we all know so well.  The same goes for Weiz, who finally gives screen-viewers some insight into the character of the Wicked Witch of the East.  She is portrayed as the elder and quite deceitful sister of Theodora who was adviser to and later murdered the last King of Oz so as to take control of Oz herself while framing his daughter, Glinda the Good Witch of the South, for the crime.  Both delivered compelling performances that left me wanting to see more of them in the films to come, as did Michelle Williams, who also gave an outstanding performance as the Good Witch Glinda as well as her counterpart in Kansas, Annie, who is foreshadowed to be the mother of Dorothy Gale.  I suppose the biggest test any actor or actress faces in portraying a character is leaving the viewer with the desire to see more of them in films to come, and I can definitely say these three more than cleared that bar definitely.

3) VISUALS: This film WOWED me with the visuals and bright colors shown throughout the film.  Just as its great predecessor did before it, the film showed the contrast between black and white filming with colorized scenery, and the result couldn't have been more appealing.  The bright colors and scenery of the Land of Oz nearly jump right out of the screen at you, and the effect will likely have kids oooing and ahhing over it for sure.  The picture quality is simply amazing (see the China Girl for a prime example of this).

4) CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:  While some may disagree with this, as an Oz enthusiast for over 25 years, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the character development over the course of the film.  Some of the biggest and most well-done examples of character development in the film are that of Oscar Diggs (the Wizard) and Theodora (the Wicked Witch of the West).  The film does a good job of showing the Wizard's transition from a petty con-man to the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz we were introduced to in the 1939 film.  For example, we are shown that Oscar was originally a womanizing con-man and illusionist that had a dubious set of ethical standards.  Over the course of the film, we see him mature and learn from his mistakes and their consequences (the hard way in some cases i.e. the transformation of Theodora).  The other biggest example lies with the character of Theodora herself.  We are shown the HUGE contrast with how she was originally compared to the version of her we are all most familiar with.  In the beginning, we are shown she is a compassionate, beautiful young witch who has the best interests of Oz at heart.  Having fallen in love with the Wizard upon his arrival in Oz, Theodora's heart is broken when her sister deceives her and convinces her that he has tried to court all of the three primary witches in Oz.  It is at this moment of utter heartbreak that Theodora's tears leave burning scars on her face (foreshadowing her weakness to water that would one day be exploited by Dorothy Gale) and she is deceived into eating a green apple that her sister promises will remove all her heartache.  This is however proven to be a deception, as the apple's effects cause Theodora's heart to rot and die, eventually disintegrating altogether.  As a result, her face is distorted and her skin is turned a bright shade of green.  Donning her now all-black attire including a black pointed hat, she assumes her new identity as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Mila Kunis delivers a stunning performance to bring this character development to life for us, and it is a real treat to behold.  These are just a couple of examples of the good character development over the course of the film.

CONS

1) ACTING:  As stated above, this cuts both ways.  While the bulk of the cast did outstanding, I will say there is one example where this was lacking in particular.  That rested with the titular character (Oscar Diggs) and its actor (James Franco).  There were times throughout the film that one could tell Franco was perhaps not the best choice to portray the role of the Wizard.  Some examples include over-the-top moments of dialogue (""Zim-zala-bim! Begone coward!  Fear my greatness!"") and his at times awkward moments in the role.  However, I do feel that by the end of the film, Franco had found his stride and was finally comfortable in the role, especially by the time of the film's climax in the battle for control of the Emerald City.  The biggest times I noticed this awkwardness/woodenness was earlier in the film, and it is true that initially I felt that perhaps another actor may have been better suited to the role of the Wizard.  But by the end, I do feel Franco has grown comfortable and competent enough to continue in the role and perfect his handle on the character.

2) LACK OF A CENTRAL MORAL TO THE STORY:  Whereas there was a clear lesson we learned alongside Dorothy during her experience in the Land of Oz depicted in the 1939 classic, it wasn't as clear in this film that there was a central moral to be learned from the story.  Whereas Dorothy learned to appreciate and cherish what she already possessed in life, it is unclear what moral Oscar was to learn from his initial experience in Oz.  I suppose we may learn that even though some of us may not feel important or powerful, our own personal strengths can make up the difference if we put our minds to it.  Beyond that, I was left wondering what we as an audience were supposed to learn from Oscar's experience.  It is clear he became a better man and finally learned from his mistakes in the end, but the overall lesson he was to learn was not entirely clear.

3) USE OF STRENGTHS:  One of the biggest gripes I had with the film was not in what it lacked, but in what it did possess but which it did not use enough in my estimation.  A very big example of this was with the character of Theodora.  While we are given a decent amount of screen time to get acquainted with her in her original form as Theodora The Good, we are not given nearly as much time to see her in her classical form of the Wicked Witch of the West.  Mila Kunis gave such a wonderful performance as Theodora, and yet when she was at her best and clearly having the most fun with the role (that of her wicked form), we were not given nearly as much screen time to see her fully in action.  While Evanora and Glinda have their face-off, Theodora simply flees the city to the West on her recently-acquired broomstick.  While it is clear we will see them all again including the Wicked Witch of the West, I still wish they would have given her more screen time to further demonstrate her effectiveness in the role of the witch.  This was not the only example of this, but you get the picture.

4) OVER-RELIANCE UPON CGI:  One thing that the 1939 classic proved was that it is possible to be highly compelling and visually stunning without Computer Generated Imagery.  While the special effects in the film were quite attractive to the eye, there were times (especially over the course of the Wizard's journey through Oz) that it bordered upon overkill.  The beauty of the 1939 classic was that we didn't have to have a lot of fancy special effects from computers to make us fall in love with the film.  Not that all computer-generated effects are bad, in fact many genuinely did add to the visual beauty of the film.  It is just a small complaint when they seemed a little over the top, such as when the Wizard was swept into the twister and transported by it to Oz.

BOTTOM LINE:  This was an excellent opening overall to a promising reboot of the Oz saga.  As I noted in the beginning, no Oz-related film is ever going to fully eclipse the 1939 classic in the hearts and minds of the American public.  However, considering the immense shadow cast over the film by the 1939 film, this film did a much better job than some would expect in measuring up in terms of quality and substance.  It is easy to judge this film and others related to the Land of Oz by the standards of the 1939 classic, but that can at times seem a bit unfair, considering how monumental the earlier film is.  If some are always looking for the perfection of the 1939 classic in every Oz-related film, I am afraid they will almost always be disappointed.  If one can come into this with an open mind however, it is a HUGE treat indeed overall.  For those that have not seen the film and are on the fence about it, I STRONGLY encourage you to give this film a shot.  It puts a wonderful modern spin on Baum's classic stories, and that is something that is definitely to be celebrated.  I am sure especially that somewhere, Margaret Hamilton is likely smiling about the new take on the character which caused her to be immortalized in cinema history.",1365984000,218,13336,4.532359081419624

You already make so much profit off of your hardcore fan base, so stop trying to bleed us dry! I am not happy with this.

5643358,1,B00BL1BIP8,"The movie was breathtaking and I rated it 5 stars on Netflix. The packaging for sale is entirely a different matter. We recently bought a 3D TV and do enjoy watching 3D but also enjoy the 2D version. We own a number of Disney combo packs which include 4 discs for every need, When I first saw the items on Amazon I was sure this was a misprint or that the full combo pack would be announced. It now appears that ""family friendly"" Disney is acting out of pure greed and stupidity. If the 3D only disc was priced at $15 it would not be such a disaster. I saw the 3D version in theaters and wanted to see the 2D version as well. We have relatives who are unable to see 3D so in order to obtain both versions in the current packaging I would have to spend $58! This is a critical time for 3D television and if studios try to gouge the public 3D may die the death that the media already predicts. This would be a loss to viewers and movie studios alike.  3D is becoming much more professional and serious ( evidence Avatar and the Hobbit) and no longer a gimmick for cheap cartoons so it would be a great loss if it no longer became available due to pure unadulterated greed. I am holding off on purchase because of the packaging although I love the movie.

5643360,5,B00BL1BIP8,"This is the first review I've chosen to do, despite many other films I have had the chance to write about. That alone should tell you how much this movie meant to me.

I saw the movie in theaters today. It was fantastic through and through. The first thing I'll mention that everyone is probably already aware of are the jaw-dropping visuals. The trailers and previews don't do it justice. You must see it to believe it. I don't believe I have ever seen such eye-poppingly beautiful scenery and digital artwork in a film. If I have, it has been a very very long time. For those reading this while the movie is still in theaters, I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX. The vivid colors, Oz's immense landscape, and the tag-along camera work grabs you by the hand and pulls you into Oz with breakneck speed just like the tornado that whisked Dorothy away! You will be immersed in such thrilling beauty it will literally make your eyes widen. A great, and I mean a really GREAT deal of money sweat and hard work were put into this movie's visuals alone. I honestly wonder how well Blu Ray will be able to capture the level of beauty and detail that this film produces.

It takes a lot of talent to take an internationally iconic story like The Wizard of Oz and give it a gigantic and immersive backstory that is simple to follow and yet colorfully written with enough modern innovation and refinement to make the movie grippingly entertaining from start to finish. There was never once a dull moment in the movie. James Franco is a great young Oz, full of charisma. Mischievous, sly, but with a heart full of gold in the end. Can you really expect anything less from the Wizard himself? The relationships between all of the characters are very heartfelt. I'm not a soft or serious moviegoer usually, but I must say, my heartstrings were plucked many a time throughout this story. It is a story of self discovery, of finding a place to belong. A story of compassion, love, empathy, and vision.

::IMPORTANT::

There are probably some of you who are undoubtedly concerned that this movie is unfaithful to the spirit and tradition of the original Oz film.  Fear not. There is plenty of homage paid to the original movie both thematically and story-wise. You will immediately spot the references to the original and will be thrilled with how they were incorporated into this movie. All the innovations made to this Oz are within reasonable boundaries of the original creative spirit and will not detract from making Oz The Great And Powerful from being one of the best family movies you have ever seen in your life!",1365724800,7,2607,4.609913793103448
5643361,1,B00BL1BIP8,"This is a review on the product itself. Not the movie!

I am deeply disappointed in Disney's latest ""experiment"" with combo packs. 3D combo packs is a premium we 3D collectors have all come to love and expect. If I have the option, I always buy the 3D combo pack. Even though I'm sure its original intention was to bring on 3D adopters, I thought Disney decided to make it a constant so that consumers could enjoy each of their movies in 3D and 2D for a premium price. I loved Disney for that, as I love them for so many other things. It's a brilliant business model that gives the consumer more options, one that has been replicated by all other studios.

How can Disney expect every family to just own a 3DTV in every room of their house? The only 3DTV this household has is in my bedroom, because I'm really the only one who cares for 3D. My father is blind in one eye so he wouldn't be able to share the experience in the living room, and my mom and brothers don't have a huge desire for 3D. Even if we were to inconveniently bring my 3DTV into the living room and watch the 3D movie in 2D using the 3DTV's options we'd only be receiving video information from one ""eye"" of the 3D version. A few scenes were intentionally made different between both versions (such as the river fairy scene) to utilize the 3D effects or tame it for the 2D, so you wouldn't be seeing the 2D version as originally intended on the 3D discs.

Maybe I wouldn't feel so strongly if the 3D only version wasn't priced as high as the 2D combo pack, but it is, which is one of the reasons why I give this product one star. The movie on the other hand deserves 5 stars. Here's hoping that others will voice their complaints and Disney will fix this before the Blu-ray is released.",1365724800,64,1756,4.251497005988024
5643362,1,B00BL1BIP8,it is sad that this is a 3D only release (dose not include a 2D version) at a premium price. I diffidently would have picked up this move if it included both (like every other 3d Blu-ray does) I hope this is not a new trend for the consumers sake.,1365724800,51,247,3.96
5643363,1,B00BL1BIP8,"I sincerely hope that this doesn't become a trend in Blu-Ray, but I'm not surprised that Disney is doing this. The 3D Blu-Ray and 2D Blu-Ray are separate releases. This wouldn't be a huge problem if the cost wasn't the same as previous releases that combine both. But unfortunately they are. Yep, if you want to own both the 2D and 3D Blu-Rays of this movie on Amazon as of now, it will cost you $63.

This benefits no-one, not even Disney, as owning a combination of both 2D and 3D was an incentive for 2D watchers to upgrade to 3D.

If you are wondering why this is such a big deal, or why many reviewers are passionately giving this product one star, just think about the long term effects. Although movie studios are trying to push people to downloading movies, there are still many people who still prefer to buy the Blu-ray versions and are willing to pay for it, because they desire the quality that downloadable content cannot reproduce.

James Franco was HORRIBLE....he couldn't quite seem to find a balance between corny and heartfelt...even at the end when he had a change of heart about his whole situation.  I really felt like most of the budget and attention went into the special effects of the film.  I have to say, i was even disappointed in those.  There were elements that really looks good....but many times, the scenary was OBVIOUSLY green screened.  You could plainly see the line from REAL set to GREEN screen background.  The whole middle part of the movie when they were searching for the Wicked Witch was BORING....you'd think there would be some twists and turns in the plot....but not really. Most of that time was spent with the characters traveling through the back CGI scenary having boring conversations.

5643369,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Well i should start by saying this is no remake of the classic The Wizard of Oz. But do NOT let that stop you from watching this movie. I will give a RARE spoiler and say that Mila Kunis is not the best at playing a villain; however Oz The Great And Powerful is still a really good movie. To describe it: It like Star Wars minus the lightsabers or relatively similar to The Chronicles Of Narnia in a sense. I was Pleasantly surprised that I Liked James Franco's  character in this movie. The plot has few weak moments but not enough to make it a bad movie. The good thing about Oz the Great and Powerful is that it knows exactly what it is, and what it is doing as a movie. So Overall, good supporting cast (Finley,the flying monkey is really cool) and an above average (just Good enough to keep your interest the whole movie) story line. I will say I Liked this film enough to buy it on Blu Ray.

5643370,5,B00BL1BIP8,"""Oz The Great and Powerful"" is not a bad movie or wrongfully wrote. I never read the books, therefore I'm going with the ""Wizard Of Oz"" movie. However I do research, and what I found stated that ""L. Frank Baum himself wrote from an in-universe standpoint, many fans of the series treat the books as if they were true, known among the fans as the ""Oz as History"" standpoint. Any confusion or contradiction between the different versions of their histories is said to be the fault of the historian making an honest mistake, of the editors for removing parts which they did not consider suitable for the child audience, of the characters involved who reported the incidents in question back to the historian, or explained by the concept that many alternate versions of Oz exist simultaneously.""

This prequel, ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" fits perfectly as can be expected. By this I mean, everyone is dead and gone that had anything to do with the ""Wizard Of Oz movie."" Besides that, I believe no one can do the old films respect, as they rely on special effects more than story.

The production starts out in black and white as the original film and switches to color. A magician (James Franco) is swept away in the manner one expects, to the enchanted land of Oz and is forced into a power struggle between three witches (some good some bad). Its theme shows how deceit and the empty promise of love can mar and undo people. This can certainly give something for teens to talk about, or for parents with their teenage children.

As for the actors? They did a fine job. I found nothing wrong with casting or the acting.

I had a very critical and old friend with me who believed, ""...the movie was fantastically produced and directed. The sound score and special effects captured your imagination without breaking the splendor of the previous film.""

The only two items either of us wondered about was:

1) ""The Wizard Of Oz"" the Wizard refuses to grant their wishes (as he cannot/no real power) but after Toto accidentally exposes him as a normal old man with no real magical powers, he tries to make up for this. He gives the Scarecrow a diploma, Lion a medal and Tin Man a heart-shaped clock. He decides to fly Dorothy home in his hot air balloon, but it accidentally takes off without her. Glinda arrives and tells Dorothy that she has always had the power to go back to Kansas; the ruby slippers will take her back. She previously did not tell Dorothy this because Dorothy had to realize for herself that ""There's no place like home"".  After saying her goodbyes, Dorothy clicks her heels three times and awakens back home in her bed, surrounded by family, the three farmhands and Professor Marvel. She claims the farmhands and Professor Marvel were in Oz, though it is implied Dorothy's visit to Oz was simply a dream.

A dream?

Yet in Oz The Great and Powerful"" it is shown not to be a dream. Nothing either of us noted even implies this.
Why?
For it is obviously a parallel reality of some sort. Hence why some people are similar on Oz to those on Earth.
A stretch?
No. Magic is just a way people explain away things they do not comprehend as science.
If, on the other hand, you wish to believe Oz is an enchanted land, then did Oz die? Is this an after life or brief dream before death? I prefer a parallel world. If you want to see the lands, look-up this: Oz and surrounding countries.

2) Why would the Wizard Of Oz want to leave? (Feeling guilty or not for Dorthy). He and Glinda (Michelle Williams) were becoming serious, and by Dorthies time they should have had children. Since many years obviously passed between this prequel and the old well known ""Wizard Of Oz""  we wished they would have covered this issue or otherwise never established a romantic relationship between Oz and Glinda.

In any event, the movie is well worth buying if you are a Oz fan. I have no issues with the paying for my ticket. And I will be purchasing the DVD when it comes out. So that should say something too.",1365206400,6,4003,4.529085872576177
5643371,5,B00BL1BIP8,"First off see this movie in 3-D; like ""Avatar"" it was made to be seen in 3-D.

Secondly you may just be surprised that the story, about a charlatan magician (Oscar, a.k.a. ""Oz"", played smarmily by James Franco who puts his great smile to good effect) who runs away from his problems in Kansas that he's created for himself, has some nice and sweet echoes within the story itself as the brief time we spend with ""the great and powerful Oz"" in Kansas has important ramifications in the wonderland known as Oz.  It's pretty easy to match up the fantasy counterparts to their faux-real world memes within these two worlds.  And though the movie makes light of Franco's philandering ways on the one hand (everything works out in an overall PG way...for him at least who receives nary a scratch or ever shows that he feels bad about himself...which he should) it also shows on the other hand how deceit and the empty promise of love can mar and undo people.  This can certainly give something for the pre-teen and teen set something to talk about, or for parents with their children.

The movie is gorgeous, sumptuous, and magical not just in the sense that there is magic in it (a la the witches played by fetching stars Mila Kunis, Rachel Wiesz, and Michelle Williams) but also in the sense that we can experience ""magic"" in different forms, from the stage magician deftly deceiving us to the conundrums of scientific principles that dazzle many of us to the sheer magic of being at the movies that we (hopefully) feel from time to time.  Perhaps not unlike the first ""Wizard of Oz"" and the effect it had on audiences, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" can too have the effect of making us feel like we're experiencing something new, real, otherwordly and yet terrific at the same time.  4.5 stars.",1365120000,11,1788,4.60377358490566

5643373,3,B00BL1BIP8,"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a triumph in entertainment longevity. Since L. Frank Baum's novel was published in 1900, the story has found relevance in the lives of generations of fans and has undergone countless reimaginings from page to stage to its most recent screen makeover, Sam Raimi's Oz the Great and Powerful.  Oz is Disney's second notable big budget update on a classic children's tale after 2010s Alice in Wonderland, and the comparisons are numerous, which may or may not excite you.

Like Alice, Oz is somewhat of a frame story where the first act takes place in the real world, and a set of circumstances launches the main character into a magical new world.  James Franco plays Oz, a traveling carnival illusionist with lofty goals but little ambition to put in the effort to reach them.  Franco does well as Oz.  His early scenes depicting Oz's sleazy ethics and immoral ways with women ring true of a young Woody Allen.  This neurotic zeal and ironic self-confidence is very entertaining and it is some of the film's best material.  However, Raimi does not waste his time getting Oz to...well, Oz.  Oz is transported to the Land of Oz by way of a fortuitous tornado, a way of transportation clearly not uncommon to early 20th century Kansas.

The Land of Oz looks  great and there are some incredible details woven into its fabric, and with a visionary director like Sam Raimi, this is to be expected.  However, the film does lose some of its freshness upon its shift to Oz.  The film is actually at its best when it is developing Oz's character at the beginning.  Once the film actually moves to the Land of Oz, it gets a bit convoluted.  The Land of Oz is being terrorized by a wicked witch, and far too much time is wasted pretending that the audience doesn't know which of the film's three witches is the bad one.  Eventually Oz allies himself with Glinda (Michelle Williams) against Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz).  Weisz is especially effective and it is unfortunate that at some point down the line, we know a house is going to land on her.  To add to the already bloated storyline, Oz also befriends a flying monkey (Zach Braff) and an orphaned enchanted china doll (Joey King), both of whom refer to characters and events set up in the film's opening act. As the film goes on, it certainly begins to fizzle, but it is not without its charm and is incredibly respectful of the reputation Oz's legacy has established.

A well-known film critic gave a favorable review to Oz the Great and Powerful partially because he said it, ""does not rest or fall back on formula.""  This is a movie that begins in a real-world setting (in black and white), magically transforms to brilliant color upon the main character landing in a fantasy world where he then meets three odd ""friends in need"" who all team up to defeat a wicked witch.  What part of this is not formulaic?  Additionally, what part of this is not 2010's Alice in Wonderland?  It's not that the film is a bad film, but let's be honest - we've seen this before.  What Oz has going for it is visual charm, a good story, and a feel-good tone; all of this working to create an effective movie experience.  Oz the Great and Powerful was released in both 3-D and IMAX and it is The People's Critic's recommendation that it be seen in 2-D, but in IMAX if possible.  The 3-D is not worth the surcharge since most of its effect is gimmick based, although the kids will get a kick out of the flying arrows or the water being spit at the screen.  IMAX screens, on the other hand, definitely enhance the fullness of the world that Raimi and everyone else ""behind the curtain"" created.  B-",1364774400,5,3673,4.559451219512195
5643374,3,B00BL1BIP8,"This really is a kids movie.... not so much geared toward the nostalgic adult though it did have a pretty good storyline, and plenty of tale charm.  I think the appeal in theme here is Oz being someone defeating the odds, overcoming substantial villains and winning the hearts of practically everyone without having any 'wizardly' powers whatsoever, in fact being just a plain ordinary person like you or I.  And of course, showing a lot of ordinary people how they can achieve perhaps extraordinary goals despite their weaknesses, etc.

Michelle Williams I thought was perfect for her role (Glinda the Good) and really hit the mark, Rachel Weisz also played a strong part as ""Evanora""..... however I felt like Mila Kunis was just too young, sounded like a high schooler (and that level of acting really).  She dropped even further as she became the black hatted Wicked Witch of the (West?) and began to rant more like a bratty teenager yelling at her boyfriend or dad.  James Franco of course being the young Oz, was pretty good but also a bit too immature for my liking and between the two they sort of leant an air of a Disney kid tv series.

There was a bit of confusion as to who was which witch, especially with there only being three and really this was a pretty major part of the whole Wizard of Oz tale they for some reason didn't choose to play out accurately.  I mean we were looking to connect the dots after all North, South, East West to the 'sequel' but they just didn't add up.
Nevertheless, the story kept you watching and the ending was good.  Whoever did the opening credits deserves some credit also, pretty exceptional work.  They almost set the bar too high.

I'm tempted to sum up the movie as ""watch three hot babes fight over guy smiley while a CGI rendered monkey and a dwarf provide comic relief"", but it deserves better than that, its a movie worth seeing and some people, depending on your taste may like it a lot.
But you can't help but wonder if they had recast a couple people, if just maybe this good film could have been a great one.",1364515200,4,2067,4.502673796791444
5643375,4,B00BL1BIP8,"I might not have gone to this movie on my own, but I willingly accompanied by daughters.  And I was glad I did.

Oz: The Great and Powerful is the prequel to the classic Wizard of Oz, one of my nostalgic favorites.  If you've ever wondered how the ""man behind the curtain"" became the great and powerful Oz (as I often have), this is the movie for you.

Oscar Diggs is a small-time magician from Kansas with big aspirations and limited potential.  When he pisses off the wrong people (e.g. the strong man of the traveling carnival show), he attempts escape and flees in his hot air balloon.  But . . . his balloon gets caught in a tornado and he ends up in the magical, technicolor land of Oz.  Sound familiar?

Because of his unusual arrival to Oz, he is immediately mistaken for a powerful wizard whose arrival has been prophesied . . . and breathlessly awaited.  It has been foretold that the wizard will help defeat the wicked witch and restore the residents of Oz to their former freedoms.

The only problems is that Oscar Diggs is a mere mortal, not a powerful wizard, and doesn't feel much motivated to risk his own life to help this foreign land.  But with a little help from a good witch and a faithful flying monkey, Oscar performs wonders . . . and becomes the man he was predicted to be.

As I watched, I found myself thinking how bizarre this movie was . . . flying monkeys, moving trees, strange inhabitants of the land.  I really enjoyed the parts that harkened back to the original Wizard of Oz . . . and then I remembered, the original had bizzare features as well.  Indeed, that is one of the appeals of the Oz films . . . both of them.  I especially liked how this film explained elements of the original.

It you grew up with the Wizard of Oz (remember when they played it once a year on television around Easter time?), you will enjoy this nostalgic trip back to a familiar and fascinating (if also bizarre) land.",1364342400,13,1933,4.35754189944134

5643377,1,B00BL1BIP8,"After reading all the other reviews for Oz The Great and Powerful, I question if we actually saw the same movie? Personally I found that this film was extremely disappointing. Without going into what the movie was about and who played whom, I am going to review what I found extremely disappointing in this film. Of course this is in no way a judgement, just my own observation. #1 the casting was poorly done. I am an avid lover of the original film and to place James Franco in the earlier role of Frank Morgan was just completely poor judgement. Then Mila Kunis as Margaret Hamilton? Granted, I do like the story line of how The Wicked Witch of the West came into fruitation but Mila Kunis? Really? Lets not get me going on Michelle Williams as the younger version of Bubbly and cheerful Billie Burke. The casting was all wrong for this film. #2 the costumes was another HUGE disappointment to me. Part of the magical allure of the original were there fun costumes. It was sad to see Disney couldn't be bothered to mask those costumes. The quick scene with the few munchkins looking poor and shabby was pathetic not to mention that the people of Emerald City looked like they were wearing every day clothing that weren't even green and lets not even mention the horse of a thousand colors that looked like they were wearing a blanket with multiple colors on it. #3 Mila Kunis costume as the Wicked Witch of the West looked more like the broadway musical ""Wicked"" costume rather then the one that Margaret Hamilton wore. and Michelle Williams Costume or crown didn't resemble Glinda's costume at all. Looked like a gown one would wear on the red carpet. Granted some may argue that Disney was trying to modernize the movie but in my opinion, if you are going to make a prequel then you pay attention to details. We have become a sad society whose interests focus on ""Special Effects"" rather then ""Art"". Just goes to prove that todays generations can not touch ""Old Hollywood"" Talents(both on the screen and behind the scenes). For those who have not seen this film, my opinion is, save your money, it was HIGHLY disappointing to one who thoroughly enjoys and prefers ""Grade A"" movies to trash.",1364083200,19,2195,4.616368286445013
5643378,1,B00BL1BIP8,"OZ: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL is perhaps one of the most confused and hopelessly lost films I've seen in a while.

I'm not sure who this movie was made for, or what brand of nostaliga they were aiming for, or what answer they were trying to provide about the origin of the Wizard of Oz - because it seems the film is more interested not in honoring or expanding the Baum books, but instead bent on insult.  The film is insulting to everyone and I mean literally everyone - first, it's insulting to men.  James Franco's OZ is right out of MAXIUM magazine model - he's unshaved in a scruffy way, conflicted about work, girls and money, he looks stoned the entire time and anything outside his direct line of sight is non-existant and yet he clearly has talent - all of which he wastes on trying to get women; and how does he do this? - he lies, he lies all the time (and he never stops, even when people know the truth).  This is a major theme in the movie - the conquest or corruption of women.  I never thought I would have to battle obvious gender and sexual politics in OZ, but it seems Rami is game for this battle.  Oz here is a rouge, but in all the worst ways - LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR (1977) worst ways if you've seen the film - he's sleezy, cheap and another man-child who thinks he will never grow old and never die.  His trip into OZ is at first to escape responsibility and, of course, ends up having to take responsibility and save OZ from...well, women.

OZ is ruled by three woman - Glinda (Micehlle Williams), the true heir to the throne and two sisters, Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weissz); Oz first meets Theodora (in black leather pants) and their meeting is a confused, but quick mess of plot and peril that throws them together - of course Oz hits on her, lies and asks her to dance (dance = sex in this film, this is not something hidden, it's pretty much pointing right to it); being have been asked to dance before (ie: virgin) Theodora falls in love with Oz right there and then - oh, and there is a long standing prophecy about a man coming to OZ named Oz who will save OZ which Oz quickly lies about to get into Theodora's foxtrot - so, they go to the most boring Emerald City ever seen on the screen (it's like leftover code of from THE MATRIX; I fully expected Neo to come flying around the corner at any moment) and we meet Evanora who is pretty clearly evil - her take on Oz is the exact opposite of her sister's - so we have a love / hate triangle going on.  Her focus instead is on Glinda who is in exile after the death of her father who was in fact murdered by - well, guess and just take one guess and you'll be right.  Evenora says Glinda is evil, which we know is not true - but the movie goes to pains to make her first appearance on screen scream Voldemort to everyone in the back row; her power is wand based and without it Glinda is powerless...so, count on Glinda doing stupid things with her wand all the time - putting it down and walking away from it for one is the most stupid and least understood in the film (why does she do it before entering a graveyard - is there a rule I'm missing?); before Oz meets Glinda he has picked up a few friends - a flying bellhop monkey and a little girl made out of china.

And, I have to admit - the China Girl scene is perhaps the single best moment of the film, it's a call back to the opening of the film and is surprising in both how touching it is, how complex it is and how devestating it is as well - it's here a grand, odd and disturbing theme is layered into the film about genocide - because clearly all of the girl's family, friends, entire world is destroyed by the Flying Monkeys  and nothing can bring them back (and nothing does); it's simply almost emotional overload so the film quickly does away with it until nearly the end - which manages to insult the moment even more.  Oz continues his lackluster journey until they finally meet Glinda who is pretty weak overall - she's not stupid, but, like the rest of the women in the film the undertow is that without a man around all women are lost.  Because until Oz arrives, these three women haven't been doing much but making snide remarks, throwing curses and plotting...that's it.  But now there is a man in the mix - well, the fur and sparks fly.  Evenora uses Oz against her sister by saying he's a letch (and he is, which makes it all the more true) and Theodora is so distraught she ends up turning into the Wicked Witch of the West - in short, a man rejects her and she chooses evil; she can't be independent, she can't go on the rebound, she can't get over him - no, because the story is locked into having a Wicked Witch we have to have her go man-crazy and lose her mind over the first guy she ever waltzed with...boring.

What happens next is your typical rise to rebellion - and this is supposed to be about freedom, as all rebellions are...but the ending is anything but, which is very odd - more in a moment; so, Glinda and Oz form their plan and they raise the troops and Oz makes ready with his most amazing trick yet (after a long, loving speech about Thomas Edison and his many wonderful inventions...some of them that seem to have clearly crossed into Oz as well - such as the light bulb; please, count the lamps in the movie) and they all go off into battle and they win!; kind of...yes, sort of...sure...it's a win, let's just call it that.  Oz fakes his death and rises from the ashes a ghostly head and scares off the Wicked Witch while Glinda has to defeat Count Dooku and his Sith powers...I'm sorry, Evenora and her green lighting powers (Sith powers) in a useless, in your face, you paid extra for it so here it goes 3D battle between the women as they fight.  It's pointless and comes off the heels of public torture and more unwanted, dark images that don't fit in this movie.  At the end, the girls all get what's coming to them, being women they should have known better than to go up against any man and Oz installs a shadow government over OZ and rules the land with fear and magic - true story; their rebellion merely sets up a secret cabal that lies to their people now.

There's more to this film than above and you will have to make your own judgments, but I do want to comment on something in the film that you can't help but notice as Rami pushes it in your face over and over and over again (I can image it is actually worse in 3D) and that's this - OZ is now integrated; racially, socially, culturally, the works - OZ is now fully colored not only with CGI but African-American's, Asians, etc; the film is so inclusive of all people that it actually comes across as racist and I say this because the parts handed to the African-American cast are so poorly fleshed out, written and 2D as to be token - that's it, I've said it - these parts were doled out like Pez to ward off backlash of an all-white cast and all white OZ and try to prove that the film is up to date and new...it's awful, it's cheap and it's clearly framed to express this.  I felt like I was watching less a movie about OZ but more an escape from the IT'S A SMALL WORLD RIDE at Disney.

OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL fails on so many levels - it's simply an insult to everyone, even when it tries to do good, tries to make us connect with OZ, it's so disconnected that we never get the chance to be there - to truly, fully belong, even though it's a world now (there is an actual globe) maybe, just maybe too much like out ours.  Click your heels quick and come back home and save yourself the trip; like a lot of tourist traps - just say you went and no one will know the difference.",1364083200,12,7648,4.201227830832196
5643379,4,B00BL1BIP8,"OK -- This is a film that many critics didn't like and I admit it had a couple of draggy parts, but maybe it's my inner child, but I liked it.  It is clearly a prequel and it pays homage to the version we all know and love.  It starts in black and white and like we expect it transitions to color.  Oscar the cheap magician is transported by tornado to Oz where he is hailed OZ, the Wizard Extraordinaire.  To critics this seems to lack originality but to me it was logical and anything else wouldn't have seemed real.  I loved the characters, Finley the flying monkey was a nice addition and lent continuity to the flying monkeys of the wicked witch we all know.  The Munchkins are there -- a bit part -- but once again expected.  The three witches were very well done and explain how they became ugly and evil.  Glinda -- aka -- Wanda to the Wizard -- is also well done as she helps the Wizard fight the forces of evil.  The very best part is the final battle where Oscar the charlatan and cheap magician is transformed into OZ, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL.  It truly connects this film to the original that we all know and love.  This is not an academy award film on any level but I don't it was ever intended to be anything but a fun film. If you are looking for anything dramatic and original this probably isn't a film for you, but if you want some fun entertainment then try this film.  As I said maybe it appealed to my inner child but I liked it, my kids liked it, and more importantly my grandchildren liked it.  A good companion piece to the Judy Garland version.",1363910400,5,1569,4.207357859531773
5643380,5,B00BL1BIP8,"Have you ever wondered how the Wizard became the Wizard of Oz or Why the Wicked Witch was so Wicked ? Well, all your questions will be answered here. This movie which was directed by Sam Raimi was an excellent movie, it had the heart and feeling of THE WIZARD OZ.

The movie even starts out in black in white like the original movie. James Franco, Zack Braff, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis all give excellent and emotional performances in this film, plus there is humor in it as well.

The 3D in the movie is spectacular and worthy of all fans of THE WIZARD OF OZ. Would I recommend this movie to anyone ? Yes I would.",1363910400,2,621,4.254237288135593
5643381,3,B00BL1BIP8,"As the title suggests, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is an origin story of L. Frank Baum's famous wizard with a very long name. James Franco plays ""Oz,"" a small-time womanizing stage magician whisked away into the wonderland, where he meets three witches Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams).

Just like Tim Burton-directed ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Sam Raimi's new film is filled with dazzling visuals (shot with 3D viewing in mind), but doesn't have a story to tell, or a character to root for. The colorful production design by Robert Stromberg (also responsible for ""Alice in Wonderland"") is impressive, to the point of almost becoming the real star of this fantasy adventure film.

I like James Franco, but I am not sure he is the right choice for the role of a self-centered con man we are supposed to like. There is almost no character development that is interesting. Because of the film's by-the-numbers script, his portrayal of Oz before he became a great ""wizard"" looks bland, and his spiritual transformation unconvincing.

This is a decent family-oriented picture that is mildly amusing. Sam Raimi, director of ""Evil Dead"" and ""Spider-man"" series, plays it too safe here, but perhaps we should know he is supposed to do so.",1363737600,3,1271,5.014218009478673
5643382,2,B00BL1BIP8,"The opening credits of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" raised hopes for an outstanding movie that soon crashed like a deflated balloon. ""Oz"" has visual interest in spades, from the black-and-white opening sequence in historically accurate aspect ratio to the wide-screen sensory cornucopia of the land of Oz, but a successful movie must amount to more than the sum of its images.

I've seen good work from all the main actors (James Franco, Mila Kunis in ""Black Swan,"" Michelle Williams in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" and Rachel Weisz in 1999's ""Sunshine"" with Ralph Fiennes) but found the performances in ""Oz"" perfunctory at best. The story felt like a ""Rango"" remake: a limited character who has only faked it in the past lands in an alien world where people think he's a desperately needed hero. He finds out whether he can live up to their expectations. The pacing was often slack, the tone wavered between childlike wonder and adult cynicism, the jokes were few and far between, and in the end I just couldn't care.

I don't know if the filmmakers meant to target kids or nostalgic adults. The kids I saw ""Oz"" with were tepid in their enthusiasm. The adults could not help but compare this bland commercial exercise to the passionate artistry of the 1939 classic. I can only attribute the stunning initial box office success of ""Oz"" to a desperate longing for escapist family-friendly entertainment.",1363737600,10,1394,4.927659574468085
5643383,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Frank Baum's Oz series has always been fertile ground for toys, comics, and books seeking to put their own spin on the public domain property.  But ever since ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the movie industry just hasn't managed to replicate the iconic film's success, and with good reason: ""The Wizard of Oz"" now defines the books, even if it wasn't a faithful adaptation.  The yellow brick road is littered with failures: ""Return to Oz,"" ""The Wiz,"" and ""Tin Man."" It took a powerhouse like Disney to finally break the curse.

The first big challenge to the film's success is James Franco as Oscar Diggs (AKA the magician known as Great Oz). Franco has something of an intellectual distance to him tinged with arrogance that makes him vaguely irritating - but it works here, because that's exactly how Oz is supposed to be.  He's a lady's man who preys on willfully ignorant women, luring them into his wiles with manufactured tales of woe that lands him in hot water, a tornado, and ultimately Oz.

In no time Oz encounters the wide-eyed Theodora (Mila Kunis) who plays the witch as a kind of mentally-addled dreamer wistfully projecting her hopes and dreams on the handsome stranger. He's prophesized to be the savior of Oz, a powerful wizard who will reclaim the Emerald City.  It's not that easy of course; it seems the steward of Emerald City is Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and she's rightly skeptical of this new wizard who can't cast a single spell.  With the Emerald City's riches egging him on, Oz is put on a quest to steal the wicked witch's wand.  It's basically the plot of ""Army of Darkness,"" with less skeletons and more monkeys.

Along the way, Oz will assemble his own motley crew of allies: flying monkey Finley (Zach Braff) and China Girl (Joey King), a living china doll.  The special effects excel in bringing these two characters to life, such that it's difficult not to stare at China Girl - a living doll that is expertly brought to life but fails to convincingly interact with any of the living characters.

Despite the fact that the plot centers on Oz being such an unlikeable cad that he turns women into witches, there's lots of things ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" gets right. For one, the script is tight - the lost art of foreshadowing is in full force here, and the movie neatly ties back to events that happen early in the film.  For another, it expertly weaves in callouts to ""The Wizard of Oz."" There's nothing more or less to ""Oz"" than what's in the later film, but it still manages to seem fresh. From the framing, to the color transitions, to the soaring score by Danny Elfman, ""Oz"" never forgets its roots.  It's a big movie with a capital ""B.""

""Oz"" is far from perfect.  It's a little off, a little too grand, a little too smarmy at times.  But that's a description that could easily be applied to the Land of Oz.  And in that regard Sam Raimi has pulled off something great and powerful.",1363651200,3,2930,4.582375478927203
5643384,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I always like the Wizard of Oz movie, but it was never one of my favorites and after Alice in Wonderland(wasn't a big fan, except for Johnny Depp) I wasn't expecting this to be very good, but I was happily surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  The movie had a lot of great humor and the entire cast did a great job.

Acting 5/5
All the actors did a great job, but my personal favorite was James Franco.  Franco played Oz extremely well, and really pulled me into the movie, and he really made me a much bigger fan of the Oz movies.

Story 4/5
The story wasn't extremely complex, but it was enough to get the point across. I think it was a great way to show how Oz was introduced into the world of the same name.

Effects 4/5
The effects were well done, not as good as something like Avatar but they did very well at showing what Oz looks like using modern day special effects.

Overall Movies 4.5/5
I really enjoyed this film, and would recommend it to everyone, especially those that enjoyed the original, or people who are fans of other Disney fantasy films.",1363651200,3,1067,4.2835820895522385
5643385,1,B00BL1BIP8,"The Sam Raimi team does not deliver a film that follows the mythology found in the Oz books.  Nor does the Raimi team deliver a film that captures the darkness and scariness found in the novels.  This is sad because even the silent films from the 1910s capture more of the darkness found in those stories.  And one would expect the director of the original ""Evil Dead"" to be able to deliver a dark Oz film, but ""Return to Oz"" from 1985 retains its crown as being the best film to capture the books' darkness and to follow their mythology.
 ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" pays tribute to the 1939 film by following its mythology and only incorporating a few elements of the Oz novels.  What results is a film that is too light hearted with a poor storyline.  If the mythology from the books had been followed, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" would have been darker with a strong story of saving Oz from oppressors.  Anyone who has read the Oz book knows though L. Frank Baum wrote children's stories, Oz stories are dark, scary, and several of the film adaptations would receive PG-13 ratings.  But ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" ignored the books' mythology.  So for people who are looking for a fantasy that is dark and full of skirmishes, read the Oz novels and hope another film reboot will make such a delivery.
 After months of interviews where Raimi stated he reviewed the Oz novels as sources of back story for this new film, one would have expected ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" to be more original in its delivery and less of a copy of the 1939 film.  This does not occur, and its delivery is pretty much a copy of that film.  ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" goes from black and white to color, introduces Kansas characters that will later be re-imaged in the Land of Oz, focuses too much on 3-D aspects, and has female characters that are too passive.  One would expect the portrayal of women to be passive during the 1930s, but in the 2010s one expects women to be aggressive and to display self reliance as they make intelligent decisions.
 This misrepresentation of Oz women is nothing new.  The 1939 film did a horrible job at accurately portraying female characters.  Judy Garland played Dorothy as being too scared and dainty.  It was not until 1985 that Dorothy Gale's personage was given justice by the actress Fairuza Balk.  She accurately displayed Dorothy Gale's lack of fear, ability to command others, and willingness to take risks in order to carry out her objectives.  It of course helped that Fairuza Balk had actually read the Oz books and that allowed her to accurately portray Dorothy.  All the women in that film displayed courage and headstrong attitudes while obtaining their goals.  And that is just how L. Frank Baum describes those women.
 Unfortunately, the women in this new Oz film are not represented in such a manner.  Most of them are represented as having to consent with a man before making any decisions.  Or they do not portray the personage L. Frank Baum describes in his novels and thus misrepresent important characters.  Particularly the portrayal of Glinda is very disappointing.  She is not as clever or as self determined as she should be and in the film she is captured way too easily.
 The only character to accurately depict personalities from the Oz books is China Girl and that allows her to steal the scene on numerous occasions.  China Girl is very intelligent, knows how to manipulate others so she may obtain her desires, talks back, and does not scare easily.  Computer generation of China Girl is excellent and is far above any other use of computer for the film.  Any other time computer generation is used, it screams fake.  The winged monkeys only look neat from a far away distance because close-ups depict them as too cartoonish.
Aside from the fact that mythology from the Oz novels does not depict the Land of Oz for this film, the most disappointing depiction in the film is the birth of the Wicked Witch of the West.  Mila Kunis acts wonderfully, but that does not help her with poor makeup used to portray the witch nor does her acting help represent the witch as being self reliant.  SPOILER: the witch is born due to a man breaking her heart and L. Frank Baum would never have written the witch in such a manner.  The witches L. Frank Baum writes about were always wicked, are independent, are clever tricksters, and are willing to kill those who oppose them.
An accurate representation of the Wicked Witch of the West would have involved her always being wicked but taking human form as a way to trick the wizard into trusting her.  From the onset, the Wicked Witch of the West would have been plotting to kill the wizard and would have enchanted creatures and plant life to kill him as he journeyed to Glinda.  Not only does this representation not occur, the representation of the Land of Oz does not even depict the presence of Kalidahs, giant spiders, killer crows, or killer wolves.  One wonders if those skirmishes will ever make into an Oz film.
 The acting for the film is good, but that does not help save the film's storyline.  Back story is given through dialogue but it is unclear about how the witches conquered the Emerald City.  The back story explains the need for a wizard to end oppression but the oppression is not accurately represented.  The audience does not know why the witches are oppressing the people, nor do they witness it, and they only see the aftermath.  There should have been scenes depicting the Emerald City in ruins and a lot more scenes displaying the people's devastation and demands for a new ruler.  But this depiction does not occur and one must actually read the Oz novels to truly comprehend why a wizard is needed to rule the Emerald City.
 In conclusion, the Raimi team has failed to deliver a good Oz film and should not make another.  A director and film team is needed who actually incorporate the mythology and personages from the Oz books.  This will give the films better storylines and of course make them dark with several scary scenes and plenty of skirmishes.  Until that happens, one wonders if the next Oz films:

Will have Dorothy Gale obtain silver slippers?
Will the Wicked Witch of the West say her infamous command: ""peck out their eyes and rip them to pieces""?
Will Mombi be forced to reveal she has kidnapped and hidden Princess Ozma?
Will Glinda use her army to recapture the Emerald City from an insurgency?
Will the Schoodlers capture Dorothy and her companions in order to eat them?
And can fans of the books truly enjoy new Oz films or will they be left to only treasure the novels and the ""Return to Oz"" film?

 Answers to these questions are very unclear because it can now be declared that the latest film reboot of the Oz stories is not following the novels' mythology.  A reboot that is true to the world of L. Frank Baum would actually require a first film that tells the story of four wicked witches conquering the Land of Oz and hiding its true heirs.  A second film would depict the process of the wizard and Glinda removing two of the witches from power and founding the Emerald City.  A third film would be an adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and films that follow would keep depicting stories where the Emerald City faces numerous insurrections and invasions which require Glinda to find the lost heirs of Oz.
 One can hope the next Oz films will shift more into the books' mythology thus creating films that are dark and will just be teetering at receiving a PG-13 rating.  Anyone who has read The Wonderful Wizard of Oz knows that a true film adaptation would be rated PG-13.  Fingers crossed, in hopes that film will at least depict Dorothy Gale in the same manner L. Frank Baum describes her.  Dorothy needs to be a plain looking preteen or a young looking teenager who is clever, does not scare easily, and talks back with some attitude.
 Three candidates come to mind that could pull off a good Dorothy Gale.  The 2010 version of ""True Grit"" reveals that actress Hailee Steinfeld would give justice to the character.  Her portrayal of Mattie Ross in ""True Grit"" demonstrates Steinfeld has the skill to assume the personage of Dorothy Gale because the characters of Mattie Ross and Dorothy Gale are quite similar.  Another candidate is actually Joey King.  Her portrayal of China Girl in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is so good; it is not out of the question to have Joey King play Dorothy.  Finally there is Chlo Grace Moretz.  Her portrayal of the comic book character Hit Girl demonstrates that Moretz has the skill to act tough and brave, as well as be sarcastic during times of peril.  All of those character traits are crucial to accurately portraying Dorothy Gale.
 Only time will tell if Dorothy Gale and other characters from the Land of Oz and the Land of Ev are going to be represented in a manner that is true to the Oz books.  One can hope that if the Raimi team is not going to make such an attempt, other film makers will with another reboot.  When that happens, perhaps book fans will finally get to see the Mouse Queen save Dorothy and her companions and witness the Cowardly Lion confront the Kalidahs.  It has been one hundred and thirteen years since The Wonderful Wizard of Oz depicted these skirmishes and book fans are still waiting to see them in an Oz film.",1363651200,14,9337,4.600604229607251
5643386,5,B00BL1BIP8,"""Oz: The Great And Powerful"" is great! This is how the story goes: When Oscar Diggs, a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks he's hit the jackpot - fame and fortune are his for the taking - that is until he meets three witches, Theodora, Evanora and Glinda, who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity - and even a bit of wizardry - Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.

The cast by James Franco (as Oscar Diggs), Mila Kunis (as Theodora), Rachel Weisz (as Evanora) & Michelle Williams (as Glinda / Annie) is great. The directing by Sam Raimi is great. The screenplay (based on the novel ""The Wonderful World Of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum) by Mitchell Kapner & David Lindsay-Abaire is great.

The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Peter Deming is great. The film editing by Bob Murawski is great. The casting by John Papsidera is great. The production design by Robert Stromberg is great. The art direction by John Lord Booth III, Todd Cherniawsky, Stefan Dechant, Andrew L. Jones, Iain McFadyen & Meghan C. Rogers is great. The set decoration by Nancy Haigh, set dressings by Christopher Casey, Kemper Harris, Anthony Klaiman, Keith Allan Miller, Jon Nicholson, Nikki Sass, Scott Schutzki & Kevan Weber is great. The costume design by Gary Jones is great. The make-up effects by KNB EFX Group (Howard Berger, Robert Kurtzman), Richard Alonzo, Ozzy Alvarez, Lee Grimes, James Lacey, Jonah Levy, Bart Mixon, Joe Podnar & Don Rutherford, special make-up effects by Nick Marra is great. The special effects supervised by John Frazier & coordinated by Robert Tyrell is great. The visual effects supervised by Vincent Cirelli, Bill Kent, Matt McDonald, Pavan Kumar Potluri, Daniel P. Rosen & Scott Stokdyk, coordinated by Jennifer Avery, Danielle Bemis, Christopher Blasko, Shu Fujita, Ryan Gaul, Lauren Guerard, Dianne Hardy, Kerry Joseph, Veronica Kablan, Daniel Kepler, Robert McGlinchey, Sharina Radia, Jeff Reeves, Joseph Shahood, Andrew Turner, Derek Weil & Eric Withee is great. The stunts coordinated by Scott Rogers & Randy Beckman is great.

This is a great family adventure film that is entertaining and well-made, visually. It is also well-done and well-crafted, as well. This is an interesting prequel to ""The Wizard Of Oz"". Sam Raimi has made an interesting movie, also an interesting choice of film outside the original Spider-Man & Evil Dead franchises. James Franco gives an interesting performance as Oscar Diggs, the man who would eventually become the Wizard of Oz, also leads an interesting cast of actors, who are themselves, interesting choices for the roles that they were cast for, just like Franco is or was.",1363478400,3,3035,4.947058823529412
5643387,4,B00BL1BIP8,"This was an enjoyable remake, lasting a wee bit over 2 hours.  Although it is the same basic story-line as the original,there are some differences.  Dorothy and ToTo do not exist and no house falls on a wicked witch.  Since there is no Dorothy, there are no ruby slippers either.  And, of course, the beautiful song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is non-existant.

Our story begins in Kansas 1905, where con-man ""Oz"" travels the country with his magic shows. He barely scrapes by with the change he makes but he dreams that someday he will be great.  He also is a ladies-man, schmoozing every pretty face he sees.  Running for his life, he hops on a balloon, cuts the rope, and laughs heartily as he escapes--until he sees everyone on the ground running.  He turns to see himself being sucked into the funnel of a tornado.  As you already know, he lands safely in the land of OZ where the adventure begins as he meets Theodora and travels to the Emerald City to fulfill the prophecy of the land and save the people from the evil witch.

The movie seemed suitable for children (unless they are very young and might have witch nighmares).  It actually seemed a lot more tame than the original movie.  I saw plenty of children in the 6 and 7 year old range at the theater.  Adults and children all seemed to enjoy the movie.  There are some cool computer-graphic imaging and anamatronics.  Although I saw this in 2-D and it was great, it was also available in 3-D. The colors are great too.",1363478400,3,1485,4.50936329588015

5643389,5,B00BL1BIP8,"This is a worthy prequel to the ""Wizard of Oz."" As of now there has yet to have been a film worthy to its sequel or prequel. The production starts out in black and white as the original film and switches to color. Aspects of Kansas are carried over into Oz so pay attention. The film has some early twists, which you may already know if you read any review, but it is nothing complicated.

James Franco stars in the title role. He reminded me of Edward Norton in ""The Illusionist."" Oz is a phoney and a bit of a womanizer. His magic consists of flash powder, glue, and determination.

The best was Mila Kunis. She owned Theodora. Clearly a People's Choice Award. Her performance alone was worth the price of admission. The movie meshes neatly into the film we all know and love. Rachel Weisz shined in her performance as well. The on screen chemistry between Franco and Michelle Williams could improve.

The flying baboons are far more fierce and scary than the flying monkeys in the original. Indeed, if your child has trouble with nightmares from horror films, you might think twice of taking them, but go yourself. Better than the ""Snow White and the Huntsman.""",1363392000,,1164,4.586538461538462
5643390,5,B00BL1BIP8,This movie was simply amazing. The movie was exactly as described an oz disney movie. Homages to Disney and the original wizard of oz can be found throughout the movie. I thought everyone was really great in their roles. Many people have said that didn't like Mila Kunis as the wicked witch of the west but I thought she was Awesome as a younger version of the iconic character. My favorite scenes were the wicked witch scenes though so I may be a bit biased. As a horror movie fan I really loved the creepy feel in a family movie. A lot of this is brought to you by the amazing feel Raimi brings to the movie putting his signature touches throughout so if your a Raimi fan like I am you will most likely love this. Overall I think if you have an open mind and don't go in to compare it to what will always be the best 1939 film I think you will enjoy it. The visuals and story amazed me so I hope it will for you to.,1363392000,4,917,4.043956043956044
5643391,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Journey back to the land of Oz with this new hit that the whole family will love.  Not to be compared with the 1939 classic, this is a fantastic movie with a lot of heart, a bit of goodness, some magic, and some trickery.  Join Oz, Finley the monkey, and China Girl (my favorite character) as they walk across the yellow brick road to defeat the wicked witch.  But beware, the wicked witch may not be the witch that it's supposed to be.

The special effects are jaw dropping and you simply must watch this in 3D.  Everything pops out at you and there were some scenes where I actually felt the need to duck.  I've never seen the land of Oz look so real.

Bottom line - gather your family and friends and see this movie in 3D while it's in theaters.  It's worth your money and your time.",1363392000,3,786,4.193333333333333
5643392,1,B00BL1BIP8,Within the first 30 minutes of the film I thought I was watching another sequel or an imitation of the Chronicles of Narnia. Though some of the characters were interesting I found Great and Powerful Oz to be very un-original. James Franco's character is to Oz what the children were to Narnia in the Chronicles of Narnia. There is a prophecy....A chosen one foretold to come and save Oz from a witch....My wife and I saw it without the kids and glad we did because this movie is very suspensful and what I would call downright wicked at times with regard to the wicked witch played by Mila Kunis. There was a woman in the theater with small children who had to leave the theatre at one point because the scenes were very scary for the children she brought in the 5 to 6 yr old range. There were scenes that moments after I heard multiple children crying in the theater.,1363305600,9,869,4.403726708074534

I love how they include elements from the original movie and clean Oz up to make it look more modern. The characters are great, especially Finley the monkey and the china doll.

There are a few jump scenes and some scary scenes in this movie. I recommend it for ages six up.

It is well worth watching.",1363219200,,410,3.9518072289156625
5643395,4,B00BL1BIP8,"When this project was announced, the general public, the critics and even the actors in the film were wondering if something could be done in these modern times to give respect to the original MGM classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" as well as Frank L. Baum original children stories but Sam Raimi (Spider-Man, The Evil Dead) did a respectable version of the story BEFORE Dorothy and her magical friends seek the Wizard of Oz themselves.

With a pleasantly crafted screenplay, written by Mitchell Kapner ( The Whole Nin Yards, Days of Wrath) and David Lindsay-Abaire (Rise of the Guardians, Inkheart), Raimi did an excellent job with the visuals and style of the film. From the make-up to the sets, the film is literally visual eye candy. Not to mention the fantastic Danny Elfman (Beetljuice, Batman) score which only adds to the wonderment of the film.

The story begins long before Dorothy ever makes it to Oz with Oscar (the Wizard to be) played wonderfully by James Franco (127 Hours, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) who does a fantastic job at playing a conman with a really big heart. He doesn't show the positive side of himself, but appears to be nothing more than a swindling con artist with nothing more that money and women on his immediate agenda.

Mila Kunis (Black Swan, That 70's Show) plays Theodora the sister of the `west' (wink, wink) who actually meets and falls in love with Oscar. Her innocence and performance are sincere and honest and when she becomes the icon that everyone has either seen or knows of, Mila really shines as the alter ego she nastily becomes. (I'll give you a hint, she turns green, fly's around on a household cleaning utensil and wears a very distinctive hat!)

Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Constantine) does an amazing job as Theodora's sister Evanora who also does a wonderful job of miss direction in the film. Not only does she motivate two characters to the point of making major changes in The Land of Oz, but she gives her sister something she (and us as the audience) will never forget!

Now you have to add the goodness and sincerity in the film, and mix it with another miss direction again, this time you have the `Good Witch"" Gilinda played wonderfully by Michelle Williams (Shutter Isalnd, Dawson's Creek). Her amazing wisdom, trust and heart are what guide, motivate and eventually mature our con man (James Franco or Oscar or Oz) into become the `Wonderful Wizard' he will be. (She also plays another role that I will tell you has a direct connection to Dorothy Gale.)

I must give a special nod to Zach Braff (Scrubs, Chicken Little) who is a bumbling assistant to Oscar in the black and white sequence but becomes more than a friend to Oz himself when they are paired up in the Magical Kingdom quite by accident. Zach's voice is that of Finely a not so bright, but loveable,  bellhop dressed chimpanzee/monkey who flies. So much heart and warmth go into their relationship you'll believe what you see.

Another real and passionate performance comes from a small on screen appearance as a different character but later as a much larger voice over for a wonderful character known as `The China Doll'.  Joey king (Crazy, Stupid, Love, Ice Age 3) gives a marvelous vocal performance with much empathy as a China Doll who lost her family. Tony Cox (SW Return of the Jedi, Bad Santa) also makes a wonderful jaunt as a disgruntled munchkin as does Bill Cobbs (Night At The Museum, The Bodyguard) who players the Head Tinker and gives Oz exactly what he needs!

What was sweet is they made references to characters and places from the original film and kept the color and vibrancy of the original. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is still the classic and nothing will probably ever be able to hold a candle to it, however this is a nice side-dish to the legend that Frank L. Baum created in his famous children's books.

There is a section where it seems a little too much visuals, butterflies, creatures, water and fauna, but once you get passed that, the story and characters come alive and really make you believe what Dorothy had no idea she would be up against in the next cinematic adventure. I love the stylistic black and white beginning of the film and the concept of the small screen being portrayed in the first 15 minutes, but when it opens to wide screen and in full amazing cinematic color, it becomes a fun film with surprises and scares where you least expect them. It might scare really small children but fans of the original classic film, and new fans, should come and hopefully will really enjoy the characters and story that is ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"".",1363046400,4,4607,4.6474201474201475
5643396,4,B00BL1BIP8,"In book form, the marvelous land of Oz, like many fantasy worlds designed to appeal to children, is long on magic and short on sex.  In the books, L. Frank Baum takes pains to emphasize that in Oz, you can be just what age you want to be, and Ozma, Glinda, Dorothy, etc. prefer to stay kids.  Unlike Harry Potter, they sidestep puberty; however, in the latest ""Oz,"" movie, the witches are hot to trot, and lust exists alongside childlike wonder (an uneasy combo at best).  Imagine ""Oz"" as a CGI-heavy Sweet Valley High complete with mean girls, nice girls and a guy who really isn't worth all the fighting over him, and you have ""Oz: The Great and Powerful.""

So would this version make Baum gyrate in his grave?  Well, if the seriously traumatic ""Return to Oz,"" hadn't already given him a workout back in 1985, I'd say yes, but in comparison ""Oz: The Great and Powerful,"" is pretty tame.  James Franco plays Oscar Diggs, a compulsive liar, ladies' man and showman, who travels with a Kansas circus circa 1900.  In order to avoid the consequences of his actions, he hops a hot air balloon and crashes in Oz, where he is believed to be the long-awaited savior who can defeat the ""Wicked"" Witch  (really Michelle Williams, who is blond, angelic and looks as if she's just swallowed a lemon) and rule Oz.  In reality, Michelle is the Good Witch, and the two sisters who rule the Emerald City (Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis) are Evil (they`re brunette, see).  Oz doesn't have any genuine magic, but he sure knows how to put on a show, and will this be enough for good to triumph?  That's a tough one, folks.

I enjoyed the movie, though. Franco comes off like an amiable big brother who's been coerced into taking part in his kid sisters' play, and the supporting cast does a decent job with a so-so script. The effects are truly - magical?  Well, more or less.  By the way, here's an idea for the sequel.  Back in Kansas, Franco is incarcerated in a mental hospital and threatened with a lobotomy if he doesn't stop prattling about Oz.  Then he hears a knock, and in comes a hot blonde nurse who looks familiar - and helps him escape. Well, maybe we don't need to equate imagination with mental illness again and scar another generation of kids. Let's hope not anyway.",1363046400,3,2263,4.496332518337408
5643397,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Somehow, James Franco is not so miscast as most critics say he is. He plays the role of Oz as the liar, cheat, charalaton, scoundrel, and infidel quite well. He comes with the Snidely Whiplash stigma quite complete. It is not difficult to believe he can outdo a bunch of know it all witches even though a strain of cowardness beseeches him in spite of it all. He has the underhandedness to do it, eventually.
However, the movie takes it's time in doing it's task. Even the beginning with with a tornado sequence is basically very slow, and even slowly photographed. I saw this movie on it's premiere showing in 3D IMAX, and it is the effects which brings out the real excitement to this movie. Without it, it remains flat and unexhilarating because the 3D effects were, after all, the main attraction. When absent, you can suddenly see the faults of this movie, and you find yourself comparing it constantly to the magical original motion picture that was a gazzillion times more better.
Fortunitely, the witches overcome a lot of the material, and it is for that I can recommend this movie, even in it's flattened state. I must get on board the 3D Blu Ray train.",1363046400,10,1163,4.596153846153846
5643398,5,B00BL1BIP8,"""Oz The Great And Powerful"" involves a con-man named  Oscar Diggs, who later becomes the Wizard of Oz (shrewdly played by James Franco). Oscar Diggs ends up in a scenic world after promising to do great things in his life, if allowed to live.  He ends up meeting three women who are all witches: The Wicked Witch of The West, The Wicked Witch Of The East, and Glinda The Good Witch. However two of them (brilliantly played by Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz) are powerful  but evil. The third witch, Glinda The Good (depicted in a fascinating way by Michele Williams), also projects magical energy but wields her talents for good.  I liked the heartfelt love story that developed between Glinda The Good Witch and Oscar Diggs (who becomes the Wizard Of Oz).  Zach Braff also makes a cameo in the film as Finley, a hardworking assistant to Oscar Diggs.  ""Oz The Great And Powerful"" is the type of fantasy film to watch for those who like to see metaphorical movies on how destiny can sometimes collide with unexpected life tests.",1362960000,9,1024,4.629834254143646

5643400,4,B00BL1BIP8,"Okay, Margaret Hamilton may be rolling in her grave. But L. Frank Baum probably won't be, because OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL for the most part succeeds as an homage and as a prequel. The plot concerns the shady origins of he who would become the legendary Wizard of Oz. And for that, we turn to the dusty plains of Kansas and a traveling circus and a low-rent magic show. Oscar Diggs is a small-time charlatan and a terrible cheat and an unflagging womanizer. We set eyes on him in 1905, in the drab back roads of Kansas, as he works his acts of prestidigitation. Oscar Diggs is remorseless in the bilking of his gullible marks. He does it with a twinkle in his eye.

And yet Diggs has a knack for alienating folks. When he infuriates a carnival strongman, Diggs must frantically pull up stakes. He soars away on a hot air balloon, only to get sucked into the twister. The next bit is familiar territory.

Disney spent north of $300 million on budget and advertising. And when you invest that many bones in a project, then you'd best fix the odds in your favor by hiring on someone like Sam Raimi. There's no denying the film's visual virtuosity. As one of many nods toward the original 1939 classic, Raimi frames the prologue sequence in black and white and in old-school 4:3 Academy ratio, holding out until Diggs' tumultuous arrival in Oz before the screen explodes in vivid color and expands to Cinemascope.

In the land of Oz a prophecy circulates, foretelling the coming of a mighty wizard who would end the tyranny of the Wicked Witch. James Franco is steady, if not spectacular, as Oscar Diggs. I understand that Johnny Depp was first offered this role, and I wonder if Franco was channeling Depp a bit in his performance. There's grandstanding and a quirkiness to Oscar Diggs. Word is, Franco took lessons from Lance Burton to help sell the sleight-of-hand stuff. From the first moment on, Diggs is presented as a charming heel, and Franco is very good at translating this onscreen. When informed by a naive witch that he's destined to be the next king, one can see the dollar signs light up his eyes. Not even the caveat of having to first destroy the Wicked Witch before he can claim the throne does much in the way of dissuasion. Off he goes on that yellow brick road, with his top hat and bag of tricks and accompanied by a china doll and a talking, flying monkey in a bellhop uniform. Can empty theatrics and pure bluff win the day?

Me, I'm starved for stories about the land of Oz. L. Frank Baum's Oz adventures are some of the earliest books I'd read as a kid. This prequel film isn't close to supplanting the 1939 MGM picture, but it's an honest, earnest enough effort that I feel good rating it 3.5 out of 5 stars. OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL rolls out enough references to that other movie that I'm satisfied with the continuity and connectivity between the two. Sam Raimi's trademark jittery camera pans and zooms provide interesting perspectives. Two CG-generated characters threaten to steal the show: Diggs' wisecracking monkey sidekick Finley (Zack Braff) and the delicate but adventurous China Doll girl (Joey King). Of the three witches, Rachel Weisz fares the best as the scheming Evanora. Michelle Williams as Glinda is properly sweet and wise and, okay, bland. Mila Kunis suffers the most as the heartsick Theodora who later undergoes an odd transformation. Kunis does okay in her early segments but cannot rally when her character later requires a show of dramatic flair.

For those curious, yes, Bruce Campbell does make his inevitable cameo. No, he doesn't play the Wicked Witch, even though he's got the chin for it.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if kids find the 1939 film more frightening. Margaret Hamilton's original, theatrically cackling Wicked Witch of the West has inspired nightmares for generations of children. Not to mention, it's harder for kids to identify with a grown man than with a lost little girl from Kansas. One inescapable element of the prequel is that the future is already predetermined. The prequel serves as a filler-in-the-blank. We know that this pretend wizard's fight, should he win it, works merely as a treading water maneuver. It's the little girl from Kansas who settles matters with finality, not the wizard. We know there's a far greater and more magical adventure still ahead. In 1939.",1362873600,3,4357,4.718791064388962
5643401,5,B00BL1BIP8,"I honestly love this prequel. It had great special effects, good characterization, and a great story that shows how the Wizard of Oz came to be. The film tries to make references to the original 1939 classic film without being sued by Warner Bros. James Franco stars as Oscar Diggs (Oz) a small-time magician and con artist in a traveling circus. When a twister comes thru Kansas, Oz is trapped in a hot-air balloon and transferred to the beautiful and enchanted Land of Oz. He is greeted by Theodora and tells him of the prophecy of a great Wizard coming and saving them from the Wicked Witch. Will a con-artist magician from Kansas be able to step up and save the people of Oz from the Wicked Witch's army? I highly recommend OZ: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL!!!",1362873600,2,757,4.532846715328467

The animation is wonderful; especially the China Doll- she is pure Disney magic! The storyline is fairly predictable, but too often movie studios ruin a film by ""forced unpredictability""... yah, I made that term up. I would encourage others to see this film for what it is- don't avoid it for what it isn't. It is an enjoyable ""ride"", far better than I thought it would be based on critical reviews. It is NOT a remake of The Wizard of Oz- it is simply a prequel, and the storyline is extremely satisfying- Give Sam Rami credit for that. How can a confidence man become both ""powerful"" and ""great"" at the same time? Can he help others but remain in character- i.e. keep the con going whilst becoming a hero? I love this aspect of the movie- I don't remember anything in film like it, save possibly The Sting. So Munchkins- take it from the lollipop guild- go see it and let Disney present you with a real treat! It doesn't suck!",1362873600,5,1068,4.538860103626943
5643403,3,B00BL1BIP8,"Sam Raimis often visually dazzling prequel to 1939s beloved classic will never replace it in the hearts of movie lovers.  But this journey that tells how the Wizard found his way to the Emerald City almost works on its own terms.  Cobbled together from elements of author L. Frank Baums 10 Oz books, team Disney and Raimi have cleverly avoided copyright and legal issues and delivered a bright, beautifully rendered 3D experience that brings to life a vivid dream world.  Even if youve never seen the other movie, this film can be a satisfying experience.

James Franco is the carnival magician and con man that flees Kansas in a hot air balloon and is whisked by a tornado to OZ where all the denizens are under the control of a wicked witch.  The people of OZ welcome him as the prophesied savior.  He tries to explain their misunderstanding, but is smitten by beautiful witch Theodara (Mila Kunis) and when he sees all the treasure for the taking, he goes along with the unintentional deception.  The big question is: Will Oz have the guts to become the leader the good citizens of Oz deserve?

For me, this eye-candy wavered between moments of genuine awe and wonder and yet I was sometimes taken out of the movie with thoughts of crass exploitation and a studio hoping to cash in on a familiar name.  Not sure why.  Sure, all movies are a business enterprise, but we should never think it when enjoying the story.  I believe Sam Raimis love of cinema is genuine and deep.  He would be making movies even if no one paid him.  Thankfully, that shows though most of the time and makes this big budget, lavish production worth seeing.",1362873600,5,1635,4.596551724137931
5643404,1,B00BL1BIP8,"It was a LONG journey down the yellow brick road. In fact I nearly fell asleep while on it. Sam Raimi did to this remake what Rob Zombie did to Halloween...RUINED IT COMPLETELY. I know i'm pretty harsh on reviews so before I start getting all the hate mail... I 'GET' that this was a disney picture. I get that it was not going to be an 'EXACT' remake and I know it's a prequel to the original OZ but if someone is going to 'ATTEMPT' to redo it then i'm going to let them have it if they fail. I don't know how great director's let this happen. Sometimes they should screen this to people who have an opinion before releasing something as it is.

First of all, Sam Raimi wants to be Tim Burton so bad it's obvious. The only thing is.. I wished it HAD been Tim Burton who directed this. That being said, The Wizard of Oz was a phenomenon this movie is merely a movie. It will fade with time. I certainly won't be buying it.

Lets start with what WAS good. The movie does have a ""old time"" feel to it, but it starts to dawn on you that theres really not much going on.. you keep waiting for something to happen and nothing really does. It had the typical plot boy meets girls and of course they all are vying for his love and like scorn women they retaliate when they don't get what they want. Um, how is this different from most movies out there?? The best part of the movie was the last ten minutes when Oz uses his trickery to fool and conquer the witches. This was the only element that really tied into the original oz where you get to know why the man was behind the curtain and that he was not a real wizard and why. The score towards the end did actually sound like the OZ classic. Too bad they didn't follow through throughout the entire movie, as it should have. It did have some cool effects but typical now in most CGI films.

The Actors. I don't know about you but i'm getting pretty sick of seeing the same ""model"" type actors playing leads. Why don't director's try using no-name actors when directing pictures that everyone will see anyway. This is usually not the case but in movies as big as the WIZARD is, people would see it regardless. Mila Kunis was HORRIBLE as the wicked witch and should have never played it. But it is not her fault. The director along with the wardrobe and the make-up effects personnel did a horrible job with this character and should all be ashamed of themselves. Lets start with the cleavage....YES the wicked witch of the west apparently had cleavage. REALLY?? UM, WHY WAS THAT NECESSARY?? It's just another example of how and why classics get ruined. The wicked witch's outfit was horrible as was the makeup not something the classic would ever let happen. I expected greatness but all I got was a witch that seemed like Raimi copied exactly from the witches in Shrek the final chapter. EXACTLY. Go take a peek, then come back and tell me i'm wrong. I'm getting a little bit tired of Mila Kunis in a lead anyway she needs to take a break she's overkill already. James Franco did a good job, not great, just ok. I'm glad we only had to tolerate Zach Braff for the first ten minutes and Michelle Williams did exactly what I thought she would in her role. I don't remember who the other witch was so that says something. None of them looked like witches in the true sense of the original. The trailer when you see the witch first approaching looks really cool but it's not even in the movie. For some reason they took that out.

To me it seemed that Sam Raimi's, OZ the great and powerful, pulled different elements from different films and copied them. I felt Johnny Depp was missing. It had elements from Alice in Wonderland, Shrek the final, and Snow White and the Huntsman all rolled into one. The only difference was the latter films were actually good. It also seems it was geared at children, hence the need for a talking monkey and a china doll. Kids will love them and I know it is a disney...BUT the Wizard of Oz appealed to the young and old alike that is what set it apart from other films, it is timeless and classic. It's sad that Sam Raimi couldn't and didn't achieve this. He should stick to horror movies and keep away from classics that are clearly too big for him.",1362873600,8,4227,4.313207547169811

5643406,4,B00BL1BIP8,"L. Frank Baum would have a conniption fit! Never in his wildest dreams (and I'll bet his were pretty wild) could he have imagined such a mind-bending, visual orgy! We are treated to a combination of PG-rated, Computer Generated overkill, truly scary flying monsters (waaaay worse than those flying monkeys in the original), a pep talk on teamwork and a lovely homage to the MGM classic (the title sequence and the first scenes set in a two-bit Kansas carnival are in black and white).

As you probably already know, this prequel shows how a cheesy con man became the man behind the curtain.

We see:
  * James Franco (""127 Hours"") is Oscar Diggs, otherwise known as Oz, who is described as a ""small-time magician with dubious ethics."" I liked his Scrooge McDuck dive into that tempting pile of gold.
  * Zach Braff (""Garden State"") is our hero's sidekick, both as a much-abused human assistant in the black and white carnival and as a (cute but much-abused) flying monkey instructed to ""Show up. Keep up. Shut up!"" in Oz.
  * Mila Kunis (""Black Swan"") eventually becomes Theodora, the Wicked Witch of the West. They worked it out so her profile is the same as Margaret Hamilton's in the original.
  * Rachel Weisz (""Agora"") is Evanora, a witch I don't recall from the earlier movie, but I'm sure she must be in the Baum series. Somehow I skipped reading them when I was a child.
  * Michelle Williams (""My Week With Marilyn"") is Annie, a young woman our hero is infatuated with in Kansas, but when she shows up as Glinda in Oz, he is confused.
  * Bill Cobbs (""The Muppets"") is the handyman/tinkerer who becomes essential to The Plan.
  * Joey King (""Ramona and Beezus"") is the little crippled Kansas girl in the wheelchair (sad), and in Oz, the China doll with the broken legs (get it?).

This is entertaining and colorful, but those flying beasts have fangs, the two evil witches shoot flaming missiles from their hands and the balloon ride is pretty scary. On the other hand, I appreciate the tribute to Thomas Alva Edison, the Wizard of Menlo Park.

Still, it's a fun family movie, full of references to the classic 1939 film and adding some new memorable characters. I wonder how this film would play out with people who haven't seen The Wizard of Oz yet.",1531094400,,432,4.345679012345679

8570130,3,B00BL1BIP8,"This movie left me with mixed emotions.  The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic,  and needless to say this is not. Not saying it's a terrible movie,  but no where near on par with the original. Let me give you fair warning that the first half hour or so in the movie was my least favorite but it picks up after that. So be patient when watching this movie and give it a chance. One of my major qualms was the overuse of CGI instead of actual landmark filming. This originally bothered me but I realized that if the original film crew of The Wizard of Oz had today's modern CGI they probably would have used it. We are in awe of the sets that the original Wizard of Oz made but those things were the best of their time period And that's put us in awe. Both films show the best of each time period. My biggest problem with the movie though was the Miscasting of major characters. I personally do not think that James Franco matches L frank Baum's character of Oz. And Mila is far from being a suitable Wicked Witch. Once again these characters do a great job with their performances but it just doesn't feel like these were the right characters 4 this particular movie.
Overall it was an enjoyable movie with a nice storyline that became more engaging as the movie progressed",1524441600,,1273,4.317991631799163
