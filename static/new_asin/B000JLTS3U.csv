8152039,1,B000JLTS3U,"York Home Video really screwed up this release.  The aspect ratio is sort of like letterboxed 1.85:1 squished into a mobile phone. Tried playing around with the ratios and gave up as everything looked stretched. BTW - Menu is abhorrent like something from DVD Shrink. Even the DVD volume is titled ""Logical Volume Identifier"".  A high school kid could have authored this DVD release better.",1489795200,,390,4.984615384615385
8152040,1,B000JLTS3U,"a very low budget attempt at film.  there were moments that this looked like it was really going to be something.  at about 1 hour 27 minutes the writer painted himself into a corner and gave up.  he tried to cover it up by using the 'ol'- 'oh... this wasn't a story about a bank robbery but it was a story about actors testing the waters of their craft.'  the writer realized: 'darn it, nobody is going to belive that!' i'll use the 'ol- 'oh... the whole story was in my head.  they're coming to take me away, ha ha...'  [that is: he was insane and this was his psychosis]
  if you want to enjoy this movie a little then only read the back of the dvd case.
what's the story about?  read the back of the case and then read my first paragraph.  yep, the whole thing is a waste of your time.
  if you want to see a good indie film then see: 'acolytes', 'freeze frame', 'the zeros', or one of these [that might not be indie] 'go', 'highway', 'freeway' or for insanity 'spider'.  i, also, like 'small town folk' and 'hide and creep'.",1300060800,,1029,4.188775510204081
8152041,3,B000JLTS3U,"Okay, I watched the whole movie, and I was bit surprised by the idiotic ending. Normally most movies where the writer, director, producer, and actor are all the same are extremely bad. This movie didn't quite go that far and it did hold my interest even if one of the producers/leading lady is also tooting her own horn as an Amazon critic. I wouldn't call it a cult classic, but it is a better first step than that of Peter Jackson. I think James E. Roberts has some potential once he realizes his name works better without the initial. I think more Cohen brother's type humor would have made the film better. Kozak's over powering sexuality made the film enjoyable, but there wasn't enough of it. The ending of the film appears to be more of actor/director/producer/writer/ (what a resume!) James Roberts' own writer block. I felt like I was watching a Monty Python skit where they didn't know how to end it, so they made it stupid.",1275264000,,934,4.565476190476191
8152042,1,B000JLTS3U,"Very sorry acting and didn't make a lot of sense! Thought it might me a suspense filled movie, but was I disapointed !!",1232668800,,119,4.217391304347826
8152043,1,B000JLTS3U,Movie sucked.  I bought it used for a penny and it wasn't worth my time watching it.  Didn't even give it to Good Will - trashed it.  Acting horrible - story started bad ended worse.,1225843200,,182,4.142857142857143

8152045,5,B000JLTS3U,"BLOCKED is amazing. Simply put, it is amazing. I was on the edge of my seat, the twists and turns kept me guessing. As soon as it was done I watched it all over again. In the vein of The Blair Witch Project, this indie thriller is an undiscovered gem that is about to be HUGE.
