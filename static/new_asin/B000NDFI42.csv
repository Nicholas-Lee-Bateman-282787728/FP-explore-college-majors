8177015,4,B000NDFI42,"Violette - deserved the Cannes Best Actress award. Isabelle Huppert floored me with her portrayal of a young lady trying her best to escape the ravages of a controlling parent. She comes across as not a vindictive person but one caught in the throes of a life that one needs desperately to escape. Consequences be damned, she must set her world aright.

The Girl from Paris - I had never seen Mathilde Seigner act before now. I thought she did a super job of portraying one who desires to escape from an urban lifestyle and take up the seemingly quaint lifestyle of a farmer. She learns along the way that things don't occur easily. When something needs to built, cared for, repaired and nurtured, the farmer is the sole source of comfort and skill. One learns not to rely on the outside for assistance but to care for onself, care for the animals, and deal with one's loneliness.",1188432000,2,880,4.569620253164557
