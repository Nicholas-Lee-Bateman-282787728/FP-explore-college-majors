8645541,3,B00IUR7PYE,"The theme of this event was the 12th anniversary celebration of the company.

P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks vs. Anglico & Jack Evans started out as a riot but evolved into a tag team match with both teams relying on double team & high flying maneuvers with Anglico & Evans working a hyper speed pace causing the Bucks of all people to slow it down but still working at a fast pace. Akira Tozawa returned after over a 3 year period to face off against Ricochet in a match that got more competitive & physical over time as they both were having fun with the other's offense including Tozawa trying to do moonsault but resulted in him german suplexing himself. Other matches include Mike Bailey vs. Chris Hero in a ""size vs. speed"" match with both men attacking with strikes, Tomasso Ciampa vs. Trevor Lee in a slow methodical match with some impact, Brian Cage vs. Johnny Gargano in a ""power vs. technical"" match, World's Cutest Tag Team vs. Team Tremendous in what became an impromptu Texas Tornado Match that saw the biggest Canadian Destroyer ever, and Andrew Everett vs. Rich Swann in such an evenly matched contest that the commentators stated that it was like Everett was ""looking in dirty mirror.""

Normally P.W.G. always delivers but this was a show was at a disadvantage with a lot of the regulars (including P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong) working other taped shows that night (TNA, Ring Of Honor, Global Force, ect.) resulting in this show not really leaving ""first gear"" until the final two matches so this was a solid show but definitely a step down from the quality normally expected.",1440288000,,1605,4.728571428571429

The first round of this tournament featured matches such as Best Friends vs. RockNES Monsters in a very fun match that saw the reveal of a unique ""secret weapon"", Unbreakable F'n Machines vs. PPRay where the Machines showcased their superior size & strength advantage leading to PPRay using their tag team combinations & taking risk with their speed advantage, Candice LaRae & Joey Ryan vs. the team of Cole Steen Cole in fellow Mount Rushmore members Kevin Steen & Adam Cole where Candice as abused & harassed but gave as much punishment as she took by working over both men either together or individually including in some areas that hurt men more than others, and the Inner City Machine Guns vs. ACH & A.R. Fox that Chris Hero on commentary described as ""2 Cold Scorpio's family reunion"" as both team where so evenly matched in their athleticism & aerial ability that they were mirror images of each other...literally...to the point where one man had just say the obvious line ""YOU ARE NOT ME!"" along with some very entertaining ring introductions.  The rest of the tournament include a semi-final match in Best Friends vs. Cole Steen Cole where we saw a different side of Best Friends than ever before as they brought the fight right to Steen & Cole as they spend as much time fighting & brawling on the outside of the ring as they did inside, the second semi-final match with the Inner City Machine Guns vs. Unbreakable F'n Machines that resulted in the longest dual chant in PWG history before both teams even touched each other with the Machines trying to beat the Guns at their own game resulting in the commentators telling them ""Your not allowed to do that move!"", and the finals in Best Friends vs. Inner City Machine Gunz in a fast paced non-stop action match with it's mix of high flying & high impact with the only downfall being that it was the shortest match on the entire show.  Other non-tournament matches include Tomasso Ciampa vs. Adam Thornstowe making his PWG debut in a match that went both in & outside the ring on more than one occasion that can just be described in one word...PHYSICAL & a four way #1 contender match with Drake Younger vs. Chris Hero vs. Kyle O'Rielly vs. Johnny Gargano that had everyone having their moment of offensive dominance at one point along with interaction between all four men at the same time leaving to various stalemates or two individual singles matches happening at the same time.

This was a quality tournament as you got a taste of all different wrestling styles along with some entertaining moments while the other non-tournament matches were good on their own as well so if your a fan of tournaments or tag team wrestling then this is an event I would add to the collection.",1396051200,,3271,4.763668430335097

The big story coming into this event was that the P.W.G. Tag Team Titles were forfeited by Appetite For Destruction due to the injury of Super Dragon.

Super Smash Bros. vs. Young Bucks would determine new champions in a No Disqualification Match that featured brawling outside into the crowd even to the announce table, chairs being heavily used while tables also came into play, the Bucks being bounced on & off the ring apron more times than I can count, and the Bucks picking on referee Rick Knox one too many times.  Kevin Steen defended the P.W.G. Championship against Brian Cage-Taylor that showcased Taylor as a ""f'n machine"" with his unbelievable strength to the point where Steen had to resort to his typical brawling style & focusing on each body part to beat up in his usual comedic way.  Other matches include the P.W.G. debut of ""Unbreakable"" Michael Elgin vs. Willie Mack that showcased Elgin's freakish strength like holding Willie up for a vertical suplex for 30 seconds & later dead-lifting him off the mat into a powerbomb, Joey Ryan & Peter Avalon & Ray Rosas vs. Candice LaRae & RockNES Monsters were at one point someone got too sleazy with Candice with RockNES giving a receipt that even made Candice turn her head away, El Generico vs. Ricochet in a physical 20 minute match, Famous B vs. B-Boy, and T.J. Perkins vs. Ryan Taylor.

This wasn't the ""blow away"" type of P.W.G. card but still full of quality action & entertainment as there wasn't a bad match on here so another event worth checking out.",1345939200,,1811,4.829032258064516
8645547,5,B00IUR7PYE,"UPDATE: For some reason, Amazon combined the reviews for the 2012 & 2013 event together so both are here.

2012:
The first round of this tournament featured such matches as the RockNES Monsters vs. Fightin' Taylor Boys that saw brawling action in & out the ring with the highlight being Brian Cage-Taylor showcasing his power & athletic ability for a guy of his stature, El Generico & Willie Mack going under the name of ""2 Husky Black Guys"" (LMAO!!!) against Roderick Stong & Sami Callihan making his P.W.G. debut, Super Smack Brothers vs. Young Bucks in a non-stop competitive match that never slowed down, and The Dynasty vs. Future Shock.  The next rounds of the tournament saw Generico & Mack against RockNES that go so competitive that we saw Willie Mack taking some chances that he normally doesn't, Future Shock vs. Super Smash Brothers in a match in my personal favorite throughout the tournament that started slow but picked up over time, and the final round between the Husky Black Guys & Super Smash Brothers.  The only non-tournament match on the card was Kevin Steen issuing an open challenge for his P.W.G. Title (due to not participating in the tournament because of Super Dragon's injury) that was accepted by Sami Callihan that saw both men brawling before the introductions that went in & out of the ring with both men taking & delivering hard hits like 3 separate powerbombs into the ring apron & one person missing a chop resulting in their open hand hitting the post hard at full speed.

This was very similar to their singles ""Battle For L.A."" tournament where if your a fan of the tournament format then you'll really love this tournament & with the art of tag team wrestling becoming a lost art in the ""majors"", it ""icing on the cake"" with the Steen vs. Sami match definitely being a bonus so I would recommend this show.

2013:
It should be noted that this year had a different twist in that each match that the P.W.G. Tag Team Champions had to defend their titles throughout the tournament in each match they were in.  The first round of this tournament featured such matches as the Inner City Machine Gunz face off against the Young Bucks that saw one non-stop spot after another with lots of double teaming moves & lots of high flying between both teams such as 3 different shooting star presses throughout the match along with some comedic moments like the first time I've ever seen a lazer pointer used in a match, Super Smash Brothers against the Unbreakable F'n Machines that saw both teams show strength & agility to the point where Player Dos had separated his shoulder in the middle of the match, Dojo Bros vs. Future Shock with Adam Cole taunting them to ""Suck His..."" & them responding the only way they know how, and the returning Briscoe Brothers against Kevin Steen & El Generico with them not getting along & reluctantly working together such as making blind tags.  The semi-finals saw the Unbreakable F'n Machines vs. Young Bucks in what was definitely the most competitive math in the tournament while Future Shock faced off against Steen & Generico with Steen having tunnel vision on punishing Adam Cole leading to the finals of Steen & Generico against the Young Bucks that saw brawling on the floor & both teams using chairs in a hard hitting back & forth match.  Non-tournament matches include Willie Mack vs. B-Boy where B-Boy was looking to punish Willie more than beat him & the second of their ""best of three series"" between Sami Callihan & Drake Younger where you could only win by submission or knockout that saw Drake bleeding from a headbutt in the opening moments with both men beating each other heavily such as a Michinoku Driver on the apron, Death Valley Driver off the stage, both men beating the hell out of each other with chairs, and even a traffic cone used.

This event was definitely strong in-ring quality but even stronger emotionally as it was no big secret that it was El Generico's last show plus having him aligned with his long time rival & partner in Kevin Steen added to it as afterwards the ring filled up with the talent & his farewell speech will go down as one of the greatest moments in P.W.G. history so this is one show that I would definitely watch.",1341705600,,4615,4.7359900373599
