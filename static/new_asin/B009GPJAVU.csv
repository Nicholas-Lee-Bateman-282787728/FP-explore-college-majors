8541339,5,B009GPJAVU,"This is an interesting 30-minute film. It is hobbled somewhat by some amateur acting, although Travis McHenry does a fine job as a Martian. The script is innovative, and unfolds at a nice pace. By the second half, I was gripped by strong emotions and I found myself in tears at the end. This film packs a punch, and proves that a good story can be compellingly told without a large film budget. ""Life On Mars"" is worth your attention.",1431648000,2,434,4.4375
