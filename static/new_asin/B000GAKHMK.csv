8129968,5,B000GAKHMK,"Crisaldo Pablo is a talented director who is able to bring m2m relationships into the public eye and make you care about the characters he develops.

He is able to show gay couples that have the same problems and struggles that heterosexual couples grapple with.

Mr Crisaldo Pablo is able to develop interesting gay male characters that are not the stereo-type macho dancers, rent boys, or drag queens.

 His work is thought provoking and encourages the viewer to hope that the characters will succeed in their relationships and achieve a sense of peace and satisfaction in their lives.",1239062400,4,587,4.959183673469388
