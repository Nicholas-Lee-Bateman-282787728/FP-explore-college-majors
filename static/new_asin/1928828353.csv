The 30 minute sessions are perfect for small group study and discussion but can also be used for a personal devotion time as well.  I am excited to introduce some in our local church to Matt Chandler and his unique communication skill that to me is unparalleled in the Church today.",1262649600,7,407,4.638888888888889

7801251,2,1928828353,"The study itself is good, but I was disappointed that the study guide only applied to the DVD and not to doing work getting people into the bible during the week..  Matt Chandler is a very good teacher, but I feel they could have gone so much deeper.  I also have trouble with the dvd working in my player.",1487030400,,306,4.169491525423729

But as for the series itself, Matt Chandler is phenomenal.  God speaks through this guy big time.  Buy it.  Just not here!",1380240000,,252,5.175

7801258,5,1928828353,"This is a great 12-week study for small groups.  Matt's teaching is sound & encouraging, with short (25-30 min)teaching videos.  The study guide is simple & easy to use with groups at any level of biblical knowledge, which allows for good discussion time.",1306195200,4,255,4.906976744186046
7801259,4,1928828353,"Philippians is a video-driven small group curriculum that includes 12 half-hour teaching sessions from Matt Chandler and a study guide that helps participants apply each message. The video sessions are of Matt teaching/preaching in a small group setting.

The content is substantive. My wife and I particularly enjoyed the way Matt draws out the stories of the people in Philippi. His exposition makes for a very personal approach to the text. Also powerful is to hear Matt speak of overcoming suffering with the hope of the gospel - this, just months before he would be diagnosed with cancer and have brain surgery. I can't help but think about how God was using this study to prepare Matt himself for the journey ahead. Now, thanks to this resource, God can use this material in our lives as well.

I don't believe it's wise for a small group to be video-based all the time (it doesn't train new leaders and it can increase the cult of personality), but if you are looking to try something different, or you have a teacher who may need a breather, this curriculum would be excellent supplemental material. I could also see church staff members going through this series together as a way of receiving encouragement and strength from Matt's expositional message.",1304467200,9,1263,4.869767441860465
