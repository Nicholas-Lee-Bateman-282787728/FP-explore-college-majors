8430109,4,B004I5MP7E,I enjoyed this series. It has strong characters and good human-interest stories.,1420329600,,80,5.75
8430110,1,B004I5MP7E,"Really deserves NO STARS. This so called police procedual series procedes to irritate annoy immeadiately and is completely unwatchable.
Disc 1, Episode 1, One begins to understand that this effort is going nowhere. The victims, bystanders
and protagonists are ALL unsympathetic, One simply does not care what happens. I watched selected episodes as a duty and it was
somewhat painful to do so. The stories are thin stuff and in many instances petty and foolish. Poor siting. Worse direction and sad attempts at acting.
Takaway: How credible is a, unloveable  280 lb female Detective Inspector with a horrible accent, little police skill and absolutely  no personal charm whatsoever?
I began to cheer for the bad guy. Over and over. Even they were reedy stuff.
Avoid this series (both 1 & 2) at all costs.",1376956800,,804,4.992537313432836
