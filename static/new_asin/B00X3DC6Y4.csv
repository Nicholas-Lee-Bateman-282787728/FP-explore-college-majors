7155985,1,B00X3DC6Y4,"WHY DO PEOPLE HATE THAT WHICH IS GOOD? This movie has a strong message of hope, courage, and change for anyone willing to take the challenge of putting their actions where their heart resides! When Black men and women are willing to die for what they believe (whether for Jesus or for money), only then will racism be abolished and as Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ""...one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.""

Scientific observation CAN prove the existence of GOD! Hundreds of millions of people's lives have been changed using the scientific method of repeatable, testable, reliable experimentation.  Anyone from any walk of life, race, religion, creed, age, or pedigree can do this experiment: ""That if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."" Romans 10:9

Just like the characters in this film who took the challenge, your life will also change forever! GREAT FILM, LOVED TO SEE LEE MAJORS AND CYBILL SHEPARD -- ONE STAR FOR ALL THOSE COMMENTS WHO ARE TOO COWARDLY TO TAKE THE CHALLENGE.",1530835200,,1170,4.669902912621359

7156003,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"What I did not expect, but very happily surprised by, this movie was not only well done with great acting it also had the gospel message throughout the movie. WOW! I was so pleased that I ended up buying more videos and handing them out at our annual Easter family gathering. I gave one video to a young mother of two teenage children, she has stage four cancer, I pray that this video will reach her heart for the Lord. This video would not be considered boring by anyone who watches it...there is so much drama going on in so many peoples lives within this movie. This video is a wonderful tool to reach the lost with the message of the gospel...watch it...then give it to someone that you care about.
God bless those who are giving bread to the hungry,
In Christ,

7156028,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"Fantastic movie! I watched it with some co-workers and it brought tears, gratitude and an overall sense of hope for this fallen world we live in. Watch it - with your significant other, family, friends, neighbors, Christians and non- believers the message is a really terrific one~",1525996800,,281,5.0
7156029,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"I cannot say enough good things about this movie. I loved God's Not Dead, and God's Not Dead 2, which is why  watched this movie. As much as I love the other 2 movies, the acting wasn't always the best and was at times a little ""stiff."" The same cannot be said for this movie. The acting was Grade A and each individual character has a compelling story that is well told and will hold you until the end.

The plot revolves around a street minister catching the attention of one of the main characters, himself a pastor. His message is the tagline of the movie, "" Do you believe in the cross of Jesus Christ?"" Which is essentially asking believers, are you more than just a Sunday Christian, who extols virtue and faith on Sunday morning, while walking around living in sin the other 6 days per week. The line is thought provoking, and leads the pastor to ask his congregation this same question. Each character has a different story of how they come to believe or not believe, and their development is fascinating to watch. The characters, there are 12 main ones total, seem to have separate stories, but the movie has them intersect in a manner that is riveting to watch up until the final minute.

You have your pastor, 2 criminals, a suicidal college student, solider with PTSD, EMS worker, Nurse who is not all in with believing, older couple struggling with grief, a mother and her daughter and both are homeless, a pregnant teenager, and a character who's background I will leave unknown because it would be a major spoiler in to his character development.

The plot is fast paced and thought provoking. As a Christian myself I can say that the movie really made me think of how I would handle some of these situation in regards to my Faith in my Lord and Savior. I love all aspects of cinema, and enjoy a good movie as much as the next person. It takes a lot to invoke a strong emotion in me while watching a movie. I an honestly say this movie made me both laugh genuinely and cry as well. Such a stereotypical line, but in this case entirely true. I highly recommend this movie for literally anyone",1525737600,,2107,4.450777202072539

7156044,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"4.5 stars.

One of PureFlix's better efforts.  Decent story(s) & a talented cast / good locations.

The ending seemed a bit rushed & the PureFlix  'Big' miracle was unnecessary (as usual) & diverted attention from the daily miracles woven through out the story.

 Not likely to win over the 'heart of stone' - but good for christians, & decent for open minded seekers.

Not of the caliber of the Kendrick Bros christian films - but ....

.... good enough that we would enjoy seeing these characters / actors in a sequel.",1521936000,,520,4.637362637362638

You can plainly see the warped edge that had ""chinks"" out of them ,hairline, but nonetheless, if you have a Blu-Ray you know you can't operate with this on the disc. This was a Blu-Ray - DVD combo pack. The DVD worked fine on all 3 of them. At this point I give up. I will just keep this 3rd shipment and just play the DVD even though I have 2 Blu-Ray players and other Blu-Rays disc play fine on both pieces of equipment. So disappointing.

The grandmother who raised her grandsons to live right - and was trying to get them back on the right path?  Black.  The person who jumped in front of another person to take a bullet so it wouldn't hit the other person?  Black.  One of the biggest heroes in the movie who risked his life in an attempt to save others from certain death?  Hispanic.  The young woman who ran away from home so she wouldn't be forced to abort her baby?  Hispanic.  The man with the bag of money that I'm sure he didn't come by legally?  White.  And one of the good guys in the movie is white, but he's also an ex-con.

So I say the movie isn't racist.  But if I had to guess, I would say it was written by a MALE, and one who doesn't think too highly of women.  Why?

First, all the husbands in this movie want to serve God and ""do the right thing"".  All their wives DON'T - and even oppose their husband's good intentions in some cases.  Example:  Husband saw a very pregnant homeless young woman and wanted to bring her home out of the cold.  Wife refused to have her in their home.  Example:  Older couple had an empty bedroom many years after the death of their daughter.  Husband wanted to put away the dead daughter's things and invite someone homeless to stay in her room.  Wife DIDN'T want to, but didn't refuse.  Example: Husband and wife volunteered for first time serving at a soup kitchen.  Husband thought it was great.  Wife's comment:  ""First time. Last time.""

An EMT (male) did everything he could medically for a man trapped under a huge heavy tank and who was possibly very close to death.  The EMT then shared Christ with this unsaved man.  The trapped man's heart was softened and he became a believer.  His very atheist wife arrived on the scene and, discovering what had happened, angrily hired an attorney to sue the EMT, and the city who employed him, claiming the EMT had used his position of authority to push his religion down a trapped man's throat, etc etc.  The EMT's kindly boss (male of course) said the city would defend him at their expense if he wrote an apology saying he had made a grievous mistake, he wasn't using his head when he did it, and it would never happen again. The boss said he would even write it for the EMT. The EMT said he couldn't do that.  The surprised boss said if he refused, the city would have no choice but to wash their hands of him and he was on his own to pay an attorney and, if he lost, which his boss assured him he would, he would lose everything he owned. The EMT did not want to lie and say he had made a mistake and that he would never do it again because he knew he would.  However, his wife pressured him to say whatever his boss wanted him to say, lie or not.

The attorney that the angry, atheist wife hired to sue the EMT couldn't wait to take the EMT for everything he owned, agreeing that what the EMT did was horrible.  Guess which gender the mean lawyer was?  If you guessed female, you are correct.

A single person with an efficiency apartment gave up his/her apartment and slept outside on a bench in the cold to give a homeless mother and young child a warm bed.  Was the single person male or female?  If you guessed male, you are correct.

A young man, against his will, had just been pressured by his brother into being involved in committing a crime.  The young man wanted to change and live right, God's way, but his brother was threatening him. Running from the police after the crime, he dashed into a church.  A member of the church who was in the vestibule, seeing the police coming down the street, guessed they were after the young man who had just dashed in, and kindly invited him in to the service and seated him where he would not be noticed if the police entered the church. The kind person?  A man.  Surprised?  Me neither.

Couldn't there have been just ONE scenario where the wife wanted to do something good and her husband didn't want to?  Or couldn't the mean attorney have been a man?  Or the kind person in the vestibule of the church a woman? I guess not.

So, why 5 stars?  Because, in spite of the obvious gender bias, it is still a very good movie with an excellent message every Christian should hear.  Me, at the top of that list.  Have a box of tissues beside you.  You'll need them. I will definitely recommend this movie to friends and family.
P.S.  I just discovered it was written by TWO men -  Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman.",1510185600,,4675,4.325259515570934

7156142,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"This is one of the greatest movies that I have ever watched. It tackles the hard issues of life and yet it shows how the power of Our Lord and God Jesus Christ can penetrate the hearts of the most hardened of sinners to transform them completely into Christlike people. It also shows that Our God is a God of Miracles and the impossible, as He even raises a Christlike man from the dead which had been reason for the salvation of an unbelieving physician. The film shows how Our Powerful Ever-Living God Jesus Christ can use even bad accidents to transform lives of those involed in them forever for their own good and redemption.
  This movie takes cinematography into a new level of excellence as it shows how it can be used to give God the glory by showing in motion pictures how Our Lord Jesus Christ can transform lives and change the hearts and minds of all those who surrender their lives to him.

7156165,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"This movie poses a compelling question to each and every one of us. Do you believe? And if you believe, then what are you gonna do about it? Faith requires action. Faith without action is dead. In the film, a dozen different souls-all moving in different directions, each discovered there is power in the Cross of Christ... The viewer is shown different ways to be used by God to witness to the unsaved in order to get them saved. The fact that God is actively at work in the lives of the people around us became a focal point that opens your mind to ways God can use us in His plan to reach others.  We can sometimes walk around with blinders on  a preconception that theres only a black and white (in your face) single approach to reach others for Christ. This approach works, but its not the only one that can be used. No single approach can meet everyone's needs. This movie debunks this limiting preconception. I really think every believer can relate to this movie.  Do we take credit where God should have the glory? Are your eyes open or shut? Or are you walking around with blinders on? Do look for ways He can use you in His plan to reach others in your every day life?

I serve in the mission field and have witnessed first-hand the power in the Cross of Christ in ordinary people's lives. This movie depicts it accurately and in so many ways challenges us.

With that being said, I strongly recommend purchasing the Do You Believe Bible Study Kit available at outreach.com. It comes with two wooden crosses and encourages you to look for someone in your sphere of influence who is in need of a touch from God...if you believe, you should do something about it  regardless of your past, regardless of your current faith walk, regardless of those around you...faith demands action. Action that can only come from you...

The Bible study really takes this movie to the next level and does it justice. It talks about how God has a plan and that every one of us is a part of Gods Plan...that God wants us to recognize our place in His plan. He invites us to be used. God is actively at work in the lives of the people around us and He will use all that we have, all that we are, and all that we have been through...that faith is more than belief, it requires action. Having confidence in Gods plan when we cannot possibly see the outcome is the point at which we understand true faith...that true faith goes beyond knowledge. True faith is tested by deeds...Jesus asks us to take up our own cross and daily follow Him. Our faith requires action. Actions always speak louder than words. Actions communicate loudly and in a more lasting way what our hearts and minds don't always reveal...if we believe God has a plan for the world, then we must have faith to participate in His plan...every day we have opportunities to share Jesus salvation with people. With every opportunity comes sacrifice...the truth is, the Bible doesnt command us to find joy in the trial. It commands us to find joy in what the trial will eventually produce...it presses the point that it doesn't matter if you thought it was an amazing movie...what will matters is that faith moved beyond just a feeling for you...what matters is doing something and talks about so much morethought-provoking discussion questions as well.",1497744000,8,3303,4.55050505050505

7156234,4,B00X3DC6Y4,"This is not a bad movie. I thought the acting and production were good.
But I didn't like some of the theological points made. 1. One of the characters basically says that God is powerless in the face of human wickedness. He simply pleads with the offender not to do wrong, and the person can choose to disobey. Of course this is true in one sense, but in another sense, it strips God of His sovereignty. God can do a whole lot more than just plead with a person's conscience. He can intervene decisively. This kind of ""God just sits by and lets us make our choices"" is often an attempt to get God off the hook and explain away why God ordains and allows evil things to happen to His children. It would be more helpful and more biblical for the character to have said he doesn't know why God allows certain things to happen, and that one day God will make it plain how He used that tragedy for our good.

2. There's a line toward the end about how God's tapestry that He's weaving through history and the ups and downs of our lives wouldn't be complete without us (each of us). Well, no. God is the only essential part of the story. We are always optional. Of course, God includes us and allows us to play important roles, but we must beware of elevating humans too much.",1488067200,10,1271,4.273858921161826

7156270,1,B00X3DC6Y4,"""Do you believe"" is technically well made. Also the actors do a good, convincing job. And showing people doing good to other people, who could be against that? It's wonderful.

Nevertheless, there is something profoundly wrong about this movie because it seems indeed that it is born out of intolerance. What the movie mainly wants to achieve is telling you: You must be a christian believer, otherwise you are a troubled, a lost or a bad person. It completely ignores that many people find luck and fulfillment, even salvation, in any religion, in sports, in social work or whatever. Or that nonbelievers are not bad people. Quiet the contrary is true.

In fact, exactly like in this movie, one can be composed with little stories the same way, that show how people, who do not believe in any god, care for other people  because as you know, they do. And in the same way a movie can show how christian believers, with their intolerance and ignorance, destroy lives of other peoples and communities, even abuse people.

What I see in this movie is the typical behavior of ""believers"" who think they are better then the rest of us. In my opinion, a real christian does not care about the religion, believe or way of life of another person and would never try to convince someone to believe what he believes. Because tolerance was one of the big messages of Jesus.",1485820800,4,1362,4.6625

I had no idea where it was all headed.  Great movie great ending.  Love the line in it after the Street guy asked the preacher if he believed in the Cross of Christ the preacher says yes after a stumble buy saying he was a preacher they guy say that was not my question then he says Yes I believe.

When I watch Sean Astin I keep hoping that he really believes the roles he is playing, but I read some interview somewhere that he has a good time doing these Christian movies but he doesn't necessarily believe the message. Bummer.
The movie is so so.. not exciting, not memorable. Not something I would buy.  Maybe you will enjoy it, but I guess I like movies that are a little more real, a little more well done ~ a little more of an excellent script, dialogue, actors and all.
With all the talent that is out there, all the writers and techniques, there is no excuse for Christian movies to be anything but excellent.
But so often I come away from them thinking that was bad. That was dopey. That could have been so much better.
This movie is just ok.",1478131200,,793,4.358108108108108

7156399,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"AMAZING MOVIE! Never have I seen such an incredible film in my life. For many years, I questioned God .. and my overall faith for that matter .. having been a very judgmental person in the process. This movie came to me in a point in my life where I had nothing but questions, and well .. this film delivered each and every answer. I LOVED IT. I can honestly say that I walked away from this film with a sense of God's unconditional love for me. And in the process, I have learned to love others even more greatly. I wouldn't say I'm a ""religious"" person. But I am a ""relationship"" kinda' guy. This movie has definitely restored my relationship with Jesus Christ and I would recommend it for all. This movie was far better than ""Courageous"", ""Facing The Giants"", and ""Fireproof"". As a child of the 80s, it is so amazing to see my ""Goonies"" hero, Sean Astin, playing these kinds of roles in films like these in this day and age. Cybill Shepard also stars in this film aside Brian Bosworth - all of whom I absolutely adore! This film surprisingly kept me on the edge of my seat and the production value was of a greater level than most Christian films. I truly wish that more films like this were made for our generation. Our only hope in this world is Jesus Christ. And this film has truly restored my faith. I recommend it to anyone out there, and it would definitely make a great stocking stuffer for the holidays. Thank you so very much, PureFlix. Keep up the great work in all that you do, and may God richly bless you. All I can say is ... AMAZING! And THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. I love you guys. ~ J",1477267200,,1601,4.252459016393443

I've recently been saved and was at a point in my life of trying to find what my purpose is. This movie really touched my heart and has renewed my faith. We all come from different walks of life. Take different paths but we ALL have one thing in common (no matter race, creed or color), and that is God loves us.  All of us, whether deserving or not. I simply do not understand why people choose not to believe. Especially when you have nothing to lose but EVERYTHING to gain. God bless you all. May this movie move you and perhaps open your eyes. God is real. Just like the air we breath. Although we cannot see it we know it's there.",1465516800,,723,4.201438848920863

7156902,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"Great movie, excellent actors and very good quality overall. Although it has strong scenes (people dying, shooting, robberies), they are all about things that happen in real life! People struggling and in need, looking for happyness. And the best thing is the different stories of different people that somehow are related and at the end, the message of love and care, which is is the most important and prominent thing in the movie, prevails. No sexuality, almost no bad words and no fantasy or weird things. I recommend to the entire family and even for kids. Better than Star Wars and many other movies that has so much attention from the media and has poor positive messages.",1455580800,2,679,4.811965811965812

7156932,4,B00X3DC6Y4,"I almost gave this five stars because I really enjoyed it.  This plot would probably be too far-fetched for many, though, so I rated it down one notch.  I, however, really enjoyed the artistry of the writer to bring all the subplots together into one incredible moment of crisis and resolution.

As is probably obvious from the cover picture, this is a Christian movie.  As a Christian, I found it very entertaining and motivational.  The inciting incident occurs when a street preacher rolls a life-sized cross down the street and asks a man in a car (the minister at the center of the film), ""Do you believe in the cross of Jesus?""  At first nearly dismissing the question because it's so obvious that a Christian minister would believe this, he smirkingly responds in the affirmative.  He's caught off-guard, however, by the follow-up question, ""Then what are you going to do about it?""  The minister, now haunted by the question, begins to really devote his life to the service of others, and he challenges his congregation to do the same.

If I'm not mistaken, there are twelve separate characters in the film, each struggling with his own crisis, many at first completely unrelated.  By the end, however, we see that all the characters' lives connect in some way -- a way that I find beautiful and meaningful.  For some, these connections may seem contrived, and the miracles that happen might be difficult for some to believe, though I have personally heard of people who have experienced similar miracles.  I guess how one receives this movie depends upon who he is and where he is in his life.",1454889600,,1602,4.7644927536231885

7157090,2,B00X3DC6Y4,"I just watched this movie.  I was excited to see it since ""God is Not Dead"" was so well done.  I must say this movie was not so successful.  It had way too much going on in it and much of it was not at all realistic.  I didn't think it did a very good job of explaining the gospel either.  The car scene was way over the top and as well the fellow who came back to life.  They could have done better with less characters and deeper plot instead of jumping around to various characters.  I don't think it succeeded in helping unbelievers ""believe.""",1451520000,,547,4.10377358490566

7157094,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"This is a very well-done inspirational film. The acting is well-done, the film quality is well-done and the story-line is also very good, if maybe a little overloaded following so many different characters in just 2 hours. Nevertheless, it makes an impact in presenting the important questions about Jesus Christ and what it means to follow Him. I especially enjoyed seeing the better-known actors/actresses doing a faith-based movie, in spite of the negative criticism that often follows those who choose to do such films. I highly recommend it for families with children about 8-10 years old and up. Younger children may not understand some of the issues presented with crime, teen pregnancy, drugs, etc. The personal interviews in the special features section are also very inspiring. As a bi-lingual speaker, I appreciated the very good Spanish overdub which got so many of the biblical terms correct (like calling prayer ""oracin"" instead ""rezar"").",1451433600,7,952,5.269736842105263

The only thing is there is a couple of scenes in the move regarding traffic accident that could be worrisome to a child , depending on maturity. One is a scene where a car gets hit in the back as a child is sitting in the vehicle, it happens really hard and unexpected, that even jolted me a bit.  Just maybe watch for that with a child around. Good morals , meaningful. If you have any further questions please let me know through Amazon and ill try to find the time on the movie where that part is at regarding the vehicle hit, should you need it.

7157210,2,B00X3DC6Y4,"A bonanza of tears, sad people, dying and homeless ones, characters feeling sorry for themselves and begging the viewers to feel sorry for them...etc, until they receive ""the cross of salvation stained with the blood of geezos"" by a well-meaning christian who is sad for all the heathen out there.

The fans of afternoon TV soap opera will feel right at home, providing they are not turned off by ""the blood of geezos, the geezos who died for your sins"" mantra and providing they have a reasonable supply of kleenex tissue handy.

Let's not forget the evil young black males of course, to spice up the movie : YO !!.

I am not necessarily anti-christian since I am a muslim myself. As a matter of fact, I very much liked the modern rendition of ""The Prodigal Son"" parable depicted in the beautiful movie ""A Long Way Off (2014)"". There was no attempt to push Pauline Christianity down people's throat in that movie.

Christians are their own biggest detractors by being passionately attached to Pauline (roman) Christianity, instead of the real teachings of Jesus. No wonder the most anti-christianity people out there are those who grew up in a christian household : they feel spiritually molested once they realize all the non-sense that was forced on them as youngsters.

Ok, my turn to do some preaching :

Quran [004:171] : ""O Followers of the Gospel! Do not overstep the bounds [of truth] in your religious beliefs, and do not say of God anything but the truth. The Christ Jesus, son of Mary, was but God's Apostle - [the fulfilment of] His promise which He had conveyed unto Mary - and a soul created by Him. Believe, then, in God and His apostles, and do not say, ""[God is] a trinity"". Desist [from this assertion] for your own good. God is but One God; utterly remote is He, in His glory, from having a son : unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth; and none is as worthy of trust as God."" (as translated by Muhammad Asad http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad)

Sure, we've seen this type of 'character tie in' in other movies but it was great to see it here without the harsh language and heavy sexual overtones that you would find in secular movies. There were guns, and some blood so depending on your sensitivity level, this may or may not be a movie that you want your young children to watch. I, on the other hand, had no problems with my 5 year old watching it with me.

His role isn't a major one, but maybe his heart wasn't in it either.  ?  Pretty much a blatant presentation of the gospel, but better done than other Christian flicks.  Since the title and cover image are clearly about Christianity it's not likely to appeal to non-believers to watch, unless they are seriously seeking or in crisis.

So that said, Christians usually love this movie, and everyone else who is in a quest for truth should find it at the least, interesting. Besides, we're all trying to be open-minded right? Wouldn't want to miss out on anything? It was very dramatic and had 12 stories of different people that eventually overlap in the movie at the end. The only thing is that it was slightly confusing, and as usual for a lot of  Christian movies, there was a lot of tearjerker action going on. Otherwise it was really great to see Lee majors again and Cybil Shepard and a lot of other good actors young and old, and I just think overall it was very entertaining, and soulful movie. It's about time that we had more movies like this movies that are sincerely concerned for everyone's souls, and it something that everyone must consider at least once in the life.

I turned my life around by starting to read the Bible again, going to church more, watching the 700 Club, and just keeping a Catholic and Evangelical (yes they are different but Jesus is their central message for both) message in my life. There are too many distractions in this world and Jesus is the path that leads to real long lasting happiness. It is amazing how many people out there believe in the wrong message like Muslims or just those that say they believe in spirituality (what a bs answer: spirituality or a ""higher being""). The world is a mess now. Imagine what it would be like with out the ten commandments or all of Jesus's parables and teachings.",1445558400,3,764,4.464285714285714

The Gospel message was not explicitly presented, but overall it was a very well done Christian movie, with points in the movie that implicitly spoke of repentance and faith in Christ Jesus for our atonement. The death scene of the construction worker was a good presentation of the Jesus' atonement by faith alone. One could argue they presented a works based false gospel, but that didn't seem to be the case in my opinion. The movie did focus on the need for Christians to have an active faith, one that is sincere and relevant to those we meet, which is completely Biblical. We should have a sincere and active faith in Christ, willing to help others and share the Good News, regardless of the opposition or consequences. I would recommend the movie for all ages.",1443139200,5,793,4.753623188405797

This movie also challenges the believer to re-examine their own relationship with Jesus, and encourages sharing their faith as the Word of God commands all true Christian believers. The video stirred or emotions, and presented several  different circumstances that culminated in an ending of the love for each other, and how their experiences affected them, but concluded by showing the power of God and His love for all, without regard for race, age, or heritage.

7157582,5,B00X3DC6Y4,What an amazing movie. I watched it twice. It is story about 12 people each with their own challenges and how God does amazing miracles in each of their lives. The opening scene portrays a gentleman carrying a cross and challenging a pastor by asking him what does that cross mean to him and the story unfolds from there. Very Powerful and a lot to think about as well as action to put into place.,1442361600,,397,4.306666666666667

7157587,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"I just rented from my local library and watched  it my wife and my 10 year old.  I am now going to purchase this.  Let me just start off by saying, for anyone that has watched other ""Christian"" movies, they are good.  Often very good. But they have a lower budget type of feel to them.  Not so for this. This has the quality feel from start to finish.  ""God's Not Do"" was good, this is EXCELLENT.

Pros:
- Excellent story
- Excellent Christian message shared
- Family Friendly, IMHO, for kids over 6 at least.  There is a some mild gun/gang violence, and a shooting, but its not gore, and with explanation should be ok for younger kids.
- Excellent ensemble cast
- The type of movie you find yourself getting into more than you expected.  The highs, the lows.  There are some twists as well, so not entirely predictable
- A must see movie

Cons:
- None for me. Honestly I can't thing of a single negative thing to say, except maybe they could have closed up some of the story lines into happy endings.  (There are merely implied)
- you might need a box of Kleenex nearby

Spoiler: If your wife has a lingering childhood crush on Sean Astin from his Goonies days, his character role in this movie will shake that image.  Sam why so harsh Sam, I kept thinking to myself.",1442361600,,1268,4.317796610169491
7157588,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"This movie was very believable, and since I am a Christain and understand how God works it was very very well done as well.  I was kinda taken a back at the twist at the end , because quite frankly that took a lot of guts and faith.  Bravo for throwing that curve ball in , I liked it !  Having seen a few (what the world would call) miracles myself I appreciated it, but would have like the ending wthier way it went .  Get out your popcorn sit back and get ready for one of the better Christian movies I have seen in a while.  I pray they make more Christian movies like this , it was well worth the money and the time.  It left me thinking for day afterwards, still thinking about it.  Thank you again Amazon for making it available , bravo!",1442361600,,744,4.020408163265306

7157645,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"I am very grateful to have been provided with a copy of this movie, ""Do You Believe?"" on DVD from the awesome people over at Fishflix.com.  I really appreciated the fact that they specifically told me that I didn't have to write a positive review on this movie, but really, how could I not?

If you've seen the movie, you know as I do that this movie will definitely touch the hearts of the general public. Heads will turn and hearts will change after experiencing the story. The impact is very strong and I walked away feeling more moved than I have with any other Christian movie I've ever watched. I've already started telling all my friends about it, and I'm sure that others that view this movie will do the same. Powerful stuff.

""Do You Believe?"" features an amazing all-star cast consisting of Mira Sorvino, Sean Astin, Alexa Penavega, Ted McGinley, Andrea Logan White, Brian Bosworth Lee Majors and Cybill Shepherd. Set in Detroit, the characters in this movie include a minister (Ted McGinley) inspired by the words of a mysterious street preacher (Delroy Lindo) carrying a massive cross, a pregnant teen runaway (Madison Pettis) that he and his barren wife (Tracy Melchior) take in, a very ill church janitor (Brian Bosworth) who takes in a homeless mother (Mira Sorvino) and child (Makenzie Moss), a born-again EMT (Liam Matthews) and his wife (Valerie Dominguez), her PTSD-suffering brother (Joseph Julian Soria), a suicidal young woman (Alexa PenaVega), an aging couple (Lee Majors and Cybil Shepherd) still reeling from the death of their daughter and a thug (Shwayze) who finds himself ready to repent for good following a robbery gone wrong. Put all those characters together in this film - multiple-narrative tales featuring a number of different subplots - and eventually they wind up coming together together in unexpected ways.

I'm not going to give out any spoilers here - but I am going to say this movie ultimately was very moving to me and I'm sure if you have any inclination to believe, you will be moved by this movie too!  This movie is a moving depiction of faithful discipleship and the power of God.

I thought a dramatic scene towards the end was a little over the top, could have been done in a more subtle manner for ""believability"". The message of the movie was easily discernible w/o being ""preachy""...motivating if you're a true believer.

I think the most important message was that God never wastes a hurt and even through what may appear to be suffering and hardship, He uses it for good and we are all interconnected in some way.  The events in these 12 peoples lives portrayed life, illness, misfortune, hope and ultimately a miracle....and there was a lesson in there for everyone.  We forget that in our daily struggles that He is with us, guiding us and teaching us through our experiences if we just listen to Him and not to our own counsel. He changes people's character from the inside out. I watched it twice.",1441152000,4,747,4.544776119402985

7157803,4,B00X3DC6Y4,"This movie was refreshing after watching a few other movies back to back with it that were purely secular in nature.  After hearing the F bomb repeatedly and watching a bunch of dysfunctional families and sexual situations masquerading as humor, it was nice to watch a movie that had some people in it that were sincerely trying to live better lives.  The Christian message in it is prevalent and I'm sure the critics will find fault with it based on that but even someone who doesn't hold Christian beliefs could watch this and enjoy seeing people genuinely trying to help others.  It was also refreshing to see people who were evaluating their lives and trying to break out of the ruts they were in - from mourning a lost child indefinitely, living with the sadness of not being able to have a child, being homeless and responsible for a child, living with cancer and remorse, and having an identity in a gang.  While its not going to win any academy awards, it was a very satisfying movie to watch and had a good ending weaving. the various characters together in a climatic moment.",1440892800,140,1085,4.606217616580311

7157819,3,B00X3DC6Y4,"I liked the movie ""God's Not Dead"" much more than this one. This is a good movie but's it's too unrealistic. It's hard to explain but every character from the movie seems to be related to one another at the end of the movie when their lives intermingle all of a sudden.

There are some good scenes such as criminals becoming Christians and renouncing their past lives. And there are also some good examples of bad people not wanting to believe in God no matter what argument they hear or see.

It's not easy to watch this movie precisely because of the subject. It's a sad movie, and its main theme is that life tends to be tragic and embracing the Christian faith makes life bearable. Nevertheless, as a Christian, I enjoyed watching the movie but I wish the plot was more realistic.",1440806400,,784,4.475524475524476

7157823,4,B00X3DC6Y4,"""Do You Believe""  is certainly one of the best Christian themed movies ever produced. It is action packed, riveting, with superb acting performances by well know actors and talented newcomers. It is a highly realistic work which reflects America's changing and often hostile attitude toward an openly expressed faith in the Scriptures and the Savior. At the same time the film demonstrates the powerful positive impact that such faith, rooted in a sacrificial love, has on a wide range of social and personal issues. For many it could be game changer in how one looks at Biblical Christianity going forward.",1440720000,5,607,5.07

From the Pastor who THOUGHT he knew where he stood in his relationship with God, to the homeless teen mother desperately hoping that God MIGHT accept her, everybody in this film is challenged. Do You Believe was thrilling, heart-wrenching and inspiring all at the same time.  I can't wait to buy this one!!!",1440374400,,456,4.772151898734177

The powerful message of this movie will stay with you, now how many movies now-a-days can do that.  This movie brings hope in Christ and a powerful message on the action of faith.  Faith is something that must be exercised, or it will wither and die.  Perfect movie for the times we live in, it's time to stand for what we believe in, If we believe in Jesus Christ...what are we going to do about it?

7157903,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"""Do You Believe"" is one of the most compelling Christian dramas I've ever watched. Twelve souls who have their own stories eventually all end up in similar circumstances. All of the characters are hurting in some way.

A homeless mother and her child are in a desperate situation. A grandmother is trying to get her two grandsons to do the right thing and their lives are spinning out of control with violence. A pastor and his wife have never been able to have kids so they help a homeless pregnant teen. A husband has to make an important decision that could cost him his job and he has a wife and kids to support. Two suicidal people meet on the day they both decide to jump off a bridge. An older couple is struggling because they have recently lost their daughter. A man is dying of cancer and has a miraculous recovery.

So you can see this movie is very intense. I loved it because each person finds God in their own way. Well worth the time spent to watch it. It was a very meaningful experience.

7157904,4,B00X3DC6Y4,"The thought expressed near the end was accurate.  We are all as if looking from the back of the tapestry God is weaving and can't see the big picture, how amazingly beautiful it ends up looking from His ""big picture"" view.  Hopefully in the end we will see how amazing the tapestry is when we see the front of it - what He's been weaving all the time, during the time we have been living.  This movie, in its ending, gives a glimpse of that tapestry and how it ends up looking.  Each of our lives lays down its own threads and contributes to the whole.

From the first moment of the film I could feel I was ""at home"" with a good, ethical Christian film, and I was comforted by that feeling.  At points the film seemed a little unrealistic - it's naive to think if we're really acting on our faith we will routinely take homeless people to live in our house permanently, as one example (since I'd not be persuaded to think that way it didn't bother me and I was still uplifted by the movie's overall theme and plot), but by the end I could see those ideas were useful and worked together to contribute to that fantastic, tapestry-like ending.  Very well done and faith inspiring.  Excellent acting.  And many of the examples really do and did reflect ideals for which we can and should strive in real life.",1440201600,5,1305,4.337448559670782

7157944,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"We very much enjoyed this feature presentation. It clearly shows how ALL of our lives are intertwined. Illustrated very well is the concept that the worst disaster with Jesus, is far better than the best situation without Him. It's hard to visualize how much more difficult our personal hardships we have experienced would have been without Jesus, and this movie is a good representation of that concept. I personally feel that the Producers did a good job on representing the Free Will of choice as there are Believers, Converts and those who still refuse to believe, portrayed in this excellent movie. ""Do You Believe"" portrayed true life quite well in my opinion, as in, at first it was a little ""confusing"" to see how each character would fit into ""the main plot"", but after a little while it all fell in together.

While change is inevitable as people and the earth evolve, as a ""child of the '80s"" I miss the simpler more innocent times of playing outside, knowing my neighbors, and using my imagination to keep myself entertained and do not find myself openly embracing the concept of change. ""Do You Believe?"" serves as a much-needed wake-up call insofar as what is TRULY important - our relationships with each other and a belief/trust in a Higher Power.  I hope to see more of these types of messages - perhaps humanity will then stand a fighting chance against corporate greed, intolerance of others, and the rapidly growing ""what's in it for me?"" attitude.",1439769600,,848,4.923076923076923

I love Sean Astin (Rudy) :) , he kinda plays the bad guy in this, but his role is pretty small.  Mia Sorvino to me is still a wonderful actress, I hope she does more of this kind of thing, I only had a picture of her as ""Romy"" From Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, but she can obviously play a more serious role. This movie sends a wonderful, but critical message to all, and I felt it all came together nicely in the end.

People are forgetting about the real meaning of the cross.

7157994,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"Maybe a little predictable, but it was a realistic look at faith putting on its workshoes and making a difference in this world.  While all of the Christian characters were quick to ""talk the talk"", most of them struggled to ""walk the walk"", and that's real.  Rather than demeaning their faith, the story shows how they overcame their doubts and fears -- and that's real, too.  The movie also delves into painful issues -- homelessness, suicide, unplanned pregnancy, juvenile crime -- and put faces (and hearts) on these problems in a way that neither sweep them away or make them hopeless.  Movies that make you actually muse about your life are rare nowadays.  You may criticize this movie for some of its flaws, but if you can turn it off at the end and not wonder about your mission in this world, you probably slept through most of it.

7158061,3,B00X3DC6Y4,"Production Values: Good.

Acting: Good; sometimes great.

Anti-Humanist propaganda: Shameless.

Writing: Great at manipulating believers; possibly even fence-sitters.

But since there is no way to logically demonstrate how Christian faith makes sense outside the context of filling dire emotional needs,...

 Each character's ""good reasons"" for adopting that religion ...
were designed to only appear logical based on urgent necessity.
  ""I need Jesus because I have a terrible emotional wound that won't stop bleeding; and no other options exist in this scripted universe, so of course I need to use Jesus-brand packing-gauze for this.""

But in order to even arrive at those moments,
the writers created scenarios that ranged from implausible to impossible in real life.
  -including a medical miracle which has literally zero real-world precedent;

-not counting rumored miracles that (of course) only ever happen when only believers are present,
and where adequate medical documentation is unavailable.
------
However, please note:
 I'm not saying that spectacular events never happen in anyone's life.

I'm just saying that no matter how amazingly things (sometimes) all just come together ..
and no matter how at-a-loss science is to explain it (at the time) ...

  The most pressing cause for objection to the entire miracle-concept
is actually not that ""miracles don't happen"".
 I don't care to take sides on that issue. I just think it depends on how you define a miracle.
  But what irks me, here, is that Christians are imagining a monopoly on these events;
even though there is zero statistical evidence (nor personal testimony) available to suggest that they have more access to such things
than Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Wiccans, Scientologists, Voodoo Priestesses, etc..

They just happen to hear about examples that fit in to their version of faith ... because that's the primary source of the stories they (personally) are hearing about.

 so while most atheists might say ""they need to think better"",
I'd rather say ""I think they need to get out more.""

-----
In any event,
the writers appeal to emotion (as hard as they could) as the only real hook to reel people in with.

And for something to push against:
 Humanism was cast as the villain.

They even made sure to poison the public well
for both Humanism and the slogan ""Good without God"", as a way to dog-train Christians into automatically perceiving hollow and bitter antagonism when they hear those words.

-----
 Now, I know a lot of non-Christians are going to vomit a bit
when they think of a Christian pushing for conversion of like-able characters that are about to die.
 It is somewhat vulture-like.

But this part doesn't actually bother me.

  If anyone I love
were about to die
and only a Nickelodeonite  were present
and if any fantasy AT ALL would bring them some comfort in the moment before they fade-to-black,
then by all means ....
tell them about how SpongeBob SquarePants  (or any other fun character) is waiting for them
in an enchanted kingdom.

But save it for the end credits; and only in such rare circumstances.

----
On the UP UP UP SIDE:

1. They carefully whispered
that the version of Christianity they had in mind
was the Universal Salvation type.
 -that being the least offensive variation;

-which will likely sway some traditionalists into that progressive direction;
-somewhat lessening the overall harm done to society in years to come.

2. Some of the values promoted here
are (ironically) Humanist values.

 Humanism is ""informed compassion"".
No league of atheists have a patent on it.
They just happen to be the leaders in our communities
 that understand it best
and promote it the most.

Even a few bible writers demonstrated some low level of that ideal.
But this movie demonstrated a greater degree of exposure to humanist values than what we could find in early Christianity.

It's 'some' progress; even if they don't realize that Jesus isn't the real source of that progress.

-------

Lastly,
 I do love the part at the very end,
where the narrator admits that his deity's design
doesn't really make any objective sense yet;
but then he asserts that he has faith that it will later,
and that he is sure that the symbol of the Cross
( not a heart; not a lover's silhouette; not a child's smile; not a ray of light; not the Earth; not anything
really relate-able in a natural sense) ... The Cross
will surely be at the center of it all.

  He loves that symbol so much,
it even gets higher praise than his deity,
all three of his deity's person(alities), humanity,
love, light, etc.

  THE CROSS!
 -The centerpiece of the Grand Plan;
an ancient torture and murder device
designed by fallible humans.
-God's pride and joy.

 And really the only way he could even come close to justifying this
was that he used it to represent ideals that he thinks are noble;
-most of which are actually not;
and a few of which actually are .. but are (at the same time) not truly Christian-specific concepts (like sacrifice and love).",1439251200,5,5038,4.928571428571429

7158079,4,B00X3DC6Y4,"Evangelical films have certain elements that are often accepted within the camp but are stumbling blocks by those in the greater artistic community.
1.  Christians films tend to tell (preach) not show instead of a good film that shows more and tells less. (Of God and Men is a great film that shows rather than tells).  The Evangelical tradition has to put a sermon in somewhere.
2.  All conflicts are resolved and works out well for those who receive Jesus and works out poorly for those who don't.  Most believers don't find things wrap up so neato-mosquito in real life.
3.  Those who don't believe are portrayed as uncaring, emotionless hardened atheists as opposed to real atheists who are often very nice and caring people.

While Do You Believe had all of these elements that will keep it from even being considered to be a great movie, it was enjoyable and entertaining.  It had the feel of Crash where lives of completely unrelated people interact.  Instead of Crash's premise of randomness and racism, Do You Believe had at its premise the working of God behind the scenes infecting various lives with a view of the cross.

Lee Majors and Sybill Shepherd did a good job as an older couple mourning a loss deciding to step back into life.  The gangster caught in the mist of the gang but having a converted heart was stirring.  There were elements important to the Evangelical community:  One look at a sonogram dispels to a mother all the denial arguments of the pro-choice movement and the intolerant humanist taking separation of church and state to a ridiculous degree.

For one sympathetic to the Evangelical Christian genre, this was an enjoyable movie - a fun nights entertainment that doesn't leave you feel defiled and depressed.  On the other hand, the cinematic flaws that typifies these types of movies will not make a believer out of one who doesn't already believe,",1439164800,2,1888,4.787037037037037

7158091,5,B00X3DC6Y4,"Others say that this movie is unbelievable and not in a good way.
What's not believable in this story?
1. Young man gets in with the wrong 'gang'.
2. Pastor Matthew and his wife can't conceive.
3. Pregnant teen is out on the streets because she doesn't want to abort her baby when others tried to force her.
4. A single mom, who lost her husband, can't make ends meet so she and her daughter are forced to sleep in shelters or their car and eat at soup kitchens.
5. An older couple grieving over the loss of their child.
6. A Marine suffering from PTSD.
7. A very depressed young woman who contemplates suicide.
8. An EMT that gets persecuted for his faith.
9. A doctor with a God complex that thinks he deserves all the credit.
10. An older man that has a bad past but has turned to help others at the expense of his own health.
Fact is, all these things happen. Unfortunately, they happen every day. What do you plan to do to make a difference?

This movie follows the lives of 12 individuals who are from different walks of life that find the same path.
I love the way their lives eventually intertwine with another. It's like a domino effect. One good deed deserves another. And another.
I am reminded of the Book of Job when the EMT is being sued for sharing his faith with a dying man. His wife, Elena, wants him to give in, apologize so he can keep his job. It was wonderful to see that he refused to back away from his faith because it may offend some.

This is a very heartwarming story. You get a glimpse into the lives of these people and may even relate to one or more of them.
If this doesn't get to you on some level, you may need to check to see if your heart is still beating.

I highly recommend this movie to Christians, non believers and those still straddling the fence.

7158112,3,B00X3DC6Y4,"I watched this movie last night with family members and we had a great discussion about faith. We're Christians and this was definitely thought provoking. The 3 star rating is an evaluation of the film (characters, plot, etc.), not the *message* of the film.

The message, like other reviewers said, is pretty clear. At times the movie feels heavy handed. In movies like ""Fireproof"" there are light moments to relieve the tension. This movie kept in crisis mode making it feel very heavy.

I think the movie is too cluttered with characters and story-lines (even if the loose ends are tied up at the end.) Any one-two of the characters could've supported a full length movie. I would've watched a whole movie about the cross-carrying character but he only appears twice.

This is a family movie but I don't recommend it for young children because of the intense themes (suicide, ptsd).

The things I really enjoyed about this movie:
*Great cast including Sean Astin and Cybil Shepherd.

*The lighting in the scenes was well done and atmospheric.

*Characters that are relate-able.

The things I had a hard time with about this movie:
*There isn't a bad word in the movie to keep it family friendly, but it was given a PG-13 rating for accident scenes and situations. This leaves us with the most articulate thugs ever to grace the screen.

*There are some plot inconsistencies like what season is it? Characters walk outside and bundle up in winter jackets in one scene, then are in short sleeves in the next scene.

*The time line is pretty mixed up. Does it take place over one week or month? I just couldn't tell.

*Things came together at the end, but not in a very satisfying way. Instead of 12 main characters this movie could've done with less and maintained the integrity of the message.

*People in this movie act really oblivious. A whole congregation ignores sirens then 2 cops walking into the church in the middle of a sermon. Pastor doesn't call the police when he sees a robbery or gets held up at gun point. What?",1438905600,8,2029,4.687323943661972

7158117,1,B00X3DC6Y4,"Short Version:
It's not believable.

Long Version:
Preaches to the choir, and the choir will be blinded by its delusions, failing to see that their emperor has no clothes. Everyone else will quickly realize the emperor is stark naked in its heavily contrived screenplay. Faith and belief must be earned from something of substance, not pure fictional evangelistic, lachrymose propaganda, which this movie wields with the subtlety of a pile driver. If its aim, in any measure, is intended to evangelize, it's a seriously misguided attempt that completely misses the target. If, instead, it's intended to be a righteous, self-congratulatory, ""feel good"" for the ""believers"" who have already been ""saved,"" it's a success, because that's all it amounts to: believers patting each other on the back for their faith.

Recommendation:
See the 2004 AMPAS (Oscar) Best Picture winner, ""Crash"" instead of wasting nearly 2 hours of your life on this lachrymose movie. See also these Ingmar Bergman classics: ""The Seventh Seal"", ""The Virgin Spring"", and his trilogy ""Through a Glass Darkly"", ""Winter Light"", and ""The Silence"". They have substantially greater depth and veracity in their exploration of existential faith and belief.",1438819200,14,1219,5.37696335078534

I would have featured a story that revolved around the little girl in the story who is living with her mom out of their car...imho that was a great focal point with potential for expanding and explaining The Scripture at the onset of the film.  I am glad that films like this are being made but a word of advice...stop featuring car crashes or sudden death to overly dramatize your points!

7158135,4,B00X3DC6Y4,"""Do You Believe?"" (2015) is a drama in the manner of 2004's ""Crash."" The plot revolves around several characters in Chicago who are fated to meet in the final act: Mira Sorvino plays a recently homeless woman with her daughter (Makenzie Moss) who are helped by a selfless man with a dubious past (Brian Bosworth) and, later, a couple who lost their daughter years prior (Lee Majors and Cybill Shepherd). Ted McGinley plays a pastor and Tracy Melchior his wife who help a pregnant runaway (Madison Pettis). Alexa PenaVega plays a suicidal young woman who hits it off with an equally-suicidal man suffering PTSD (Joseph Julian Soria). Liam Matthews plays an Emergency Medical Technician who is threatened by a lawsuit that will ruin his career, unless he lies; Valerie Dom&iacute;nguez plays his half-believing wife and the striking Andrea Logan White the merciless prosecutor. Sean Astin plays the latter's significant other, an atheistic doctor who mocks believers. Meanwhile Shwayze and Senyo Amoaku play brothers caught up in a brutal gang war in the hood. Lastly, Delroy Lindo plays a fearless evangelist who literally carries a cross through the streets of Chicago.

While ""Do You Believe?"" is made in the mold of ""Crash,"" it's different enough to stand on its own (""Crash"" itself was obviously inspired by 1991's ""Grand Canyon""). Being an overtly Christian production by the producer and writers of 2014's successful ""God's Not Dead"" (but not the same director), ""Do You Believe?"" is unsurprisingly less downbeat than ""Crash."" While there's a lot of teary-eyed drama it comes with the territory and I like the way the plot threads come together in the well-executed tragic sequence of the third act. Well not technically as good as ""Crash"" or ""Grand Canyon,"" it's not far off and it's certainly more inspirational than the former, maybe the latter as well, but that depends on how blatant you prefer your inspiration.

Obviously, if you're not open to the message of Christ, don't watch this film. You'll loathe it. Wait a second -- maybe you SHOULD watch it, lol.

The film runs 120 minutes and was shot in Manistee, Ludington, Muskegon Heights, Michigan; and Chicago.
