8260073,1,B0015VS6TA,"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound. This is in reference to the Sinister Cinema DVD release. The Movie gets 3 to 4 stars from me personally.",1208908800,,385,4.361111111111111
