Ok so its not real tapes big deal. These are like mini horror movies and Monster Quest is boring. Alright I do admit the acting is cheesey at times. The creatures are more realistic in this. Monster Quest uses cheaply animated renderings and horrible effects. I would rather get this than Monster Quest.

3923253,5,B002FOFX8I,"For years I've wanted some kind of Monster encyclopedia or database where it takes itself seriously. The debate whether these creature exists is still going on, but even as a skeptic, you would expect for there to be a good collection of information. Other than Max Brooks' ""The Zombie Survival Guide"", I've never found anything that took itself seriously. And then I found this.

Animal Planet for the last few years has been making amazing Mockumentaries on the supernatural and this has to be one of their best. Not only is it a great source for at least core information on these creatures, but the Blair Witch Project style is done very well and is extremely creepy.

I'd not only recommend this to supernatural fans, but to horror fans.

I would also like to remind everyone that there is a disclaimer at the beginning of every episode that these are not true lost tapes. Those who think they are, you are just making us all look like fools. Stop it.",1398643200,2,956,4.6117647058823525

3923304,2,B002FOFX8I,"The film footage was so bad you couldn't tell what you were seeing at all. This does not constitute evidence. If the footage were slowed down, perhaps even frame by frame, maybe you could see what was there. The fact that they don't do this probably means there wasn't anything all that unusual, i.e., no chupacabra. Maybe a dog or some other animal.

It's all presented in the typical, over-excited tones of a BS reality show. Something awful happened to those people, and their unfortunate little girl was traumatized, (glad she survived) but I'd bet it wasn't  a chupacabra.",1379894400,,577,4.818181818181818

3923306,2,B002FOFX8I,This isn't a show outlining real stories (or at least first person accounts that are supposed to be real). Each episode is a dramatized story made for tv and acted out like a real life event reenactment. All in all it's not worth your time.,1374364800,,240,4.355555555555555
3923307,3,B002FOFX8I,"I give it 3 stars only for the following reasons: the stories are inspired, which means they are not true. Question: Why do that? Kids tell stories that are not true, real and imaginary stories are in newspapers and published in some books. Why do this here? There is no real footage, other than a few pictures here and there that probably can be found on the internet. So this is a bad thing about the episodes. Episodes are less than 20 minutes each and that is not something I am satisfied with. Too short. I only appreciate those real footages they used in their episodes and some of the new information I could get out of these episodes. This is why i rate it 3 stars. I also can easily understand now why people dislike ''Lost Tapes''. It's not the best, compare to other programs on this subject.

In episode 4 some facts were given about .. (guess it).. skateboarding injuries and visits to hospitals of hospitalized skateboarders in the U.S. Who cares about that? So much for cryptozoology!

Conclusion:
~85% rubbish that didn't happen,
~15% of useful information,
Average special effects,
Minimum of information,
Minimum of narration from the narrator.

3923311,4,B002FOFX8I,"This series dares to tackle some of the more ""fringe"" specifics in the cryptozoology realm!  It seems that instead of specific case studies they use ""composite dramatic reenactments"" to capture the over-all theme or feel of a specific mystery animal.  The show is interesting but seems to lack the details that would come from typical case studies.  The production quality of the show varies some, and leans between quite good on some episodes and disappointing on others!  The actors seemed to fill the rolls well enough, especially since they had no real opportunity for extensive character building.

  I enjoyed watching the first season, but I would not recommend it to anyone but those truly into cryptozoology; and if one is ""technologically spoiled"" and must have the best of sets, effects, and all that goes with big budget productions; then this particular collection would not be a good fit for you!  Perhaps the later seasons are a bit better on the production side?",1371945600,2,978,4.993827160493828

3923354,5,B002FOFX8I,"Imagine, for a moment, that the world you were taught to believe in- where the monsters under your bed were figments of your imagination -was a lie. Yeah, I know, you'd scoff and laugh. What if there was video evidence of it? Granted, the majority of the evidence doesn't capture the ""monster"" for the most part, but, with an open mind, it gets you wondering.
Each episode of this peculiar shows has a set structure, including interviews with experts in different fields of zoology (yes, including the controversial cryptozoology) that don't say ""It exists! I can prove it!"" but rather does comparisons, tell of legends, give anecdotal evidence and case studies, etc.
I've been interested in cryptozoology since I was a kid, since it's a no-brainer a show like this would get my interest right off the bat. In today's world of thinking, though, there's next to no room if you want to be taken seriously if you have an open-enough mind to consider the possibility of these creatures really existing.
Also, except for a couple of the later episodes, you really don't SEE the creatures, yet you're given a general idea they're there and, at times, the stories within the videos do not end well (like the little girl's parents dying in the first episode).
Nevertheless, if you do have an open mind, it does get you wonder... ""What if...?""",1367798400,,1334,4.779220779220779
3923355,3,B002FOFX8I,The first few episodes were decent. Some even interesting. After watching the first 10 episodes I found the program to be pretty predictable.

3923356,4,B002FOFX8I,"I love this show, It scared the crap out of me in a way that most movies can't. Occasionally cheesy, for example, the jersey devil episode was a little hard for me to believe, but the show redeemed itself with the vampire episode.",1364774400,,230,4.372093023255814
3923357,2,B002FOFX8I,"I double- and tripled checked the episode about the female ""astronaut"" who supposedly died from something she picked up in space.  NO SUCH ASTRONAUT is listed ANYWHERE on NASA's website!!!!  And the episode doesn't say it's using a fake name, so that's not the case.  I was skeptical in the first place: if ANY astronaut would die within less than a month after returning from space, it would've made HUGE headlines, even if they ""fudged"" the cause, and I CERTAINLY hadn't heard any such news.  Animal Planet should be ashamed of itself.  I believe there ARE creatures IN and FROM this planet that we don't know still exist: these ""fake"" shows make any legitimate sightings, etc. seem suspect.

3923361,1,B002FOFX8I,"My fianc wanted to watch this, we thought it was either a fictional show (like X-Files) or a documentary type show investigating people who believe they had seen something out of the ordinary. Instead, it's a fictional show pretending to be using people's lost video tapes as ""evidence"" of paranormal or fictional beasts (Bigfoot, lochness monster). The idea of the show is somewhat interesting but the ""actors"" in the ""home movies"" are terrible. We had to turn it off within 10 minutes.",1361577600,,487,4.951219512195122
3923362,4,B002FOFX8I,I'm enjoying the lost tapes very much. They really make you wonder what's out there and with the proof that has been shown it makes you think that we don't know very much about our planet,1360454400,,187,4.222222222222222
3923363,2,B002FOFX8I,"I used to love this show and watched it on Animal Planet all the time, thinking it was real. Now that I'm older, I believe it would take somebody extremely dumb to believe this show is real! I actually did research on the HellHound (which was one of the episodes), and the HellHound, also known as the Black Shuck, is supposed to be a black WOLF-like creature with red eyes, and the legend says, if you see the Black Shuck three times, you die. They got that part right. However the alleged Black Shuck used in the episode, was not a wolf, it was a Rottweiler! Then, there's the Jersey Devil. The Jersey Devil is supposed to be a kangaroo, combined with a horse and bat. In the ending of this episode it was guy in a gorilla suit! So just so you guys know, these are based off of real legends, but the ""Video Tapes"" are fake.

EDIT: And one last thing, this actually proves this show is fake! On season 3, the episode Zombies and The Serpent God, uses the EXACT SAME ACTORS!",1356998400,,974,4.264864864864865

3923386,1,B002FOFX8I,"When I bought this item, I thought I was buying a real-time, scientific study of cryptozoology. What I got was a series of stupid, fictionalized, very badly-acted accounts of what may or may not have been attacks by various mythological beasts. It was like watching episode after episode of the inane Blair Witch Project with different monsters in guest-starring roles. My favorite laughable moment was towards the end of the section on the Chupacabra when a thermal camera picks up three people being chased through the desert by an image who looks to be about the size and romping friskiness of a German Shepherd puppy.

In my opinion, this series was a total waste of money. My advice? Anyone who is in search of a good education about cryptozoology as well as a well-done, technology-based search for said creatures should opt instead for Destination: Truth.",1351987200,2,862,4.944827586206896

3923388,1,B002FOFX8I,"Last night, my boyfriend and I snuggled up and thoroughly enjoyed this show!  We just kept watching it.  He thought it was funny when I shouted out, ""Kick it in the teeth!"".  I really got into it, in a really good, clean, fun, interesting family way.  It reminds me of how much I LOVED to watch In Search Of with Leonard Nimoy, as a child.  This show was interesting, showed great photographs, and was done with lots of fun and good footage.  We kept asking is that real video?

But then we kept watching it and it got so unbelievably lame! that we thought it was so stupid and a waste of money! and also, it seemed to be about showing girls in white t-shirts and bikinis who couldn't act and the reactments were soooooooooooooo lame!",1348272000,2,734,4.352941176470588
3923389,5,B002FOFX8I,"This series made by Animal Planet is just simply amazing to watch. The information and dramatizations are setup in a way that really draws you into the myths and other supernatural happenings in a way that avoids disbelief and debunking. The whole point of it all is to give the best case for these things happening with all the evidence available so that you will find yourself a little less likely to walk up to the native american wearing wolf skins, or a little more cautious when going out at night. It is a show for believers and those that want to believe as well as those that want something to scare them a little and help fuel their imagination. The series is very well made and highly entertaining and will be enjoyed by just about everyone, even debunkers may enjoy the chance to scrutinize the show in front of them.

3923394,3,B002FOFX8I,Lost Tapes is an okay show about mythical creatures. I know a lot of people don't like it and I haven't given a damn what another person has thought in years. I like it because it tells a story about a person who has come face to face with the targeted creature. Who the hell cares if it's real or not! It's frekin reenactment so yes that is a prop. Get over the fact that it looks fake. It is fake. All the show is here for is to try to scare you and keep you entertained for an hour. Give you a couple of fun facts and history on the creature. Another reason I like it. It doesn't focus on the same god damned creatures. How many times have you heard about vampires and Bigfoot?

3923400,4,B002FOFX8I,"*****This DVD set is a re-issued version of the first season of the show. This set contains the same programming and deleted features as the original version. The difference in this release is in the editing. When Lost Tapes is brodcast, it often has a splash screen with the show's logo and episode title before and after commercial breaks (which are many). This is (to me) annoying and tends to disrupt the flow of the show. The first version on DVD contained the splash sreens. This new edition DELETES THE SPLASH SCREENS before and after the commericial cuts. The episodes flow better  and it is easier to follow the story without the annoying cuts. The logo splash is only at the beginning and end of the show. It is a great improvement.*******

Lost Tapes is my favorite Animal Planet show. It tells stories of alleged creatures disputed by science with first person accounts in realistic settings. It is entertaining, but you don't often get a good look at the creatures. That is why I didn't give this season a five star rating. That was changed in Season 2. The shows producers upped the scare factor in the second season that is currently airing. I can't wait for that to come out on DVD. The first season does contain some good stories and I love the diversity of the casts and locales. The set contains two DVDs with seven episodes on each and some deleted scenes.

Disc 1 contains:
Chupacabra
Skinwalker
Monster of Monterrey
Devil Dragon
Thunderbird
Cave Demons
Bigfoot

Disc 2 contains:
Oklahoma Octopus
Death Raptor
Swamp Creature
Megaconda
Hellhound
Mothman
Death Worm

My favorites include Bigfoot, Death Raptor and the Swamp Creature. I had rented the first edition which contained the splash logos and it was sometiemes difficult to follow the action. It is more enjoyable to watch this fun show on DVD without the annoying splash screen cuts, as you can follow the story better. If you are thinking of buying this show, make certain that you get this version and not the first release. I'm waiting for season 2!",1273276800,31,2031,4.7585227272727275

3923402,2,B002FOFX8I,"In the vein of Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch and (to an extent) Cloverfield, the Lost Tapes is another attempt to present ""staged handfilmed"" footage as if it were real. I first heard of this show from my mother who told me that it was based on true frightening accounts and included real video footage of legendary creatures.  Unfortunately, I believe that much of the acclaim this series has found is because a majority of its fans believe that the video footage is either real or a recreation based on real events.  Let me tell you that neither is true.  How do I know?  Because I wrote directly to Animal Planet.

  According to Animal Planet, these episodes are based on the ""possibility that these creatures exist.""  For example, there is a legend of Sasquatch roaming around parts of the US.  Animal Planet's writers think of a way that ""somebody"" might come into contact with the creature if it existed.  Then the writers determine what would be a feasible way that the animal would be captured on film if it ""did"" come into contact with somebody.  The combination of this setting and a reason for it being filmed generates the 15 minute episode.  The fact that the entire event is fictitious is not the real problem.  The problem is that the level of acting varies from good to mediocre without ever being great.  Most episodes are quite cheesy.  Some of them never even show the creature in question.  The camera becomes shaky, the actor drops the camera, and then you see them being dragged out of the view of the camera.  If this were a student film, I'd say it was a very clever concept for a low budget venture into filmmaking.  After spending $20, however, I'm not impressed enough by these works of fiction to say that I felt my money was well spent.

  At regular interludes throughout the fictional short the episode presents a few 30-60 second pieces of myth or speculation which are much more interesting than the core movie. Some of them are actually worthy of being in a documentary, such as Native American pictures of Thunderbirds, or pictures of Giant Snakes in different parts of the world. However, some of them are also simply useless.  The Oklahoma Octopus is one such example.  The basis of the episode is that many people drown each year in Oklahoma Lake.  That's it.  Absolutely no reason why they made an episode about an octopus.  In fact, I think it's rediculous to simply assume that an ""octopus"" is responsible, rather than make an episode about the location and what possible dangers it ""could"" be.

  This series lies in stark contrast to Animal Planet's rival show ""River Monsters.""  Every single episode from River Monsters is completely enthralling, entirely based around fact, and actually SHOWS the animal responsible for attacks. Please read my review on that series if you really want to know why I feel it is better.

  Overall, if you have seen this show and like it because you enjoy the fictional encounters with fictional creatures...then please go ahead and purchase the series.  If, on the other hand, you have not yet seen this series then please be wary.  It is very low budget, and nowhere on par with other shows on Animal Planet. I gave it 2 stars only because it has a little bit of where the legend began (about 2-3 minutes total) and has so many episodes.  I'll be giving this to mother and prepare myself for the next season of River Monsters.",1262476800,22,3408,4.678451178451178
3923403,4,B002FOFX8I,"Right off the bat, take it for what it is, a collection of fictional Blair Witch type of stories based on the possible existance of creatures like bigfoot, The Chupacabra and other 'Cryptids'.  That said, sit back and have fun.  The fictional 'found footage' is interspersed with baseline back ground information on the subject creature and is actually far more entertaining than the Monster Quest series that never turns anything up.  As with any show some episodes are better than others but on the whole I like it.  Favorite episodes include 'The Hell Hound' and the 'Monster of Monterey'.",1254528000,6,592,4.94949494949495
8369260,1,B002FOFX8I,"It frightens me how many people think this series is good. It pieces together bits of reports, and the creates (or I should say attempts to create) a Blair-witch-type fictional story with lost footage. So very painful to watch. If the writing and acting were better it might be endurable. Ditto if it were actual fictional shorts revolving around these reports. But, no, its blends the worst of several genres. My threshihold for suspension of disbelief for the sake of entertainment is pretty high, but this mess . . . No.",1513468800,,523,4.758241758241758

8369267,5,B002FOFX8I,"This is the first season and I think the best of them all.  While I think some of the accounts were staged, I don't doubt that many of these creatures are real.  Coming from Australia, the episode featuring the giant monitor is my favourite.  That there are some really huge lizards in remote parts of the Great Dividing Range I think is really likely, although it remains to be seen if they are really surviving Megalania.  They could simply be unusually large specimens of known species.  The episode featuring the Oklahoma Octopus is pretty scary too, and I don't think that I would be willing to swim in a lake or other body of water with a creature like that.",1437782400,,664,4.5
