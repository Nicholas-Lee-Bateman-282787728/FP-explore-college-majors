3700523,5,B001MVWMEI,"I discovered the first season of Rick and Steve during my first year of law school, and it helped keep me sane and amused. While the Second Season does not stand up quite as well upon repeat viewings as the first, it is still utterly delightful. I highly recommend it as an entertaining diversion for people who enjoy gayness and hilarity.",1238284800,4,339,4.573770491803279
3700524,5,B001MVWMEI,I absolutely love this series and sad this was the last season. This is a very hilarious gay stereotyped cartoon that will have you laughing out loud. A great mix of characters.,1365897600,,177,4.5625
3700525,5,B001MVWMEI,This one of the most talked about and watched DVD by the GLBT people and they stop at season 2!? UUUGGGHHH!! They need to make another season! I LOVE Rick & Steve!,1353369600,3,163,4.125
3700526,4,B001MVWMEI,"ok - you have to be in the mood for this type video. its like Southpark in the early years. Makes me wonder if this had been real live actors if they could have gotten away with as much dialogue as they do in this. If they ever make a season 3 I'd most likely get it!

Vendor sent it way ahead of estimated delivery date and I received it in exactly as described! Great transaction!",1350345600,,382,4.026315789473684
3700527,5,B001MVWMEI,"This was a great second season, I think it was even funnier than the first!  With the conflicts between Pussy and the new baby, Lesbian Bed Death, and Kirsten's feelings of being a mother, this season did have many issues in it that deal with having new children and the gay community.  This is especially true with the season (series) finale.  In fact the only issue I have with this season is that it is the last, but the final episode is treated as a season finale, and not a series finale.  Even still this is a great show, but much like the first DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN (or anyone who is homophobis or is offended easily!)",1288483200,,632,4.3760683760683765
3700528,5,B001MVWMEI,Shipping didn't waste packaging by putting more than needed. The DVD was in great condition. I'd shop from them again any day.,1250726400,,126,4.7727272727272725
3700529,5,B001MVWMEI,"After purchasing the first season, I HAD to check out the second. This did NOT disappoint.
The same sassy, vulgar and occasionally touching humor is still here. What i crave from the show are the insults, and am still laughing writing this review.
Despite the fact that it make look cartoonish to the casual browser, this is NOT for the kiddies. True, some of the jokes or dialogue may go over some heads, but is mainly adult fare.
A treat to those who may never have heard of this series, as both gay and straight will appreciate the interaction between the characters. To me, it was the hard work the creators endured to make such an original product.
I give this 5 stars, for making me laugh, and laughed i did.",1247270400,,714,4.458015267175573
3700530,5,B001MVWMEI,This DVD set is very funny. The writers poke fun at the many gay and lesbian stereotypes. If you need some light hearted fun this is indeed the DVD collection to watch.,1246579200,,168,4.28125
3700531,5,B001MVWMEI,"Oh goodness, gracious! Rick and Steve: The Complete Second Season is just as sick as Season One! What a rambunctious and clever adventure! Good for what ails you; whether your OUT, in, or undecided. This show has humour for EVERYone!",1241913600,,233,4.85
3700532,5,B001MVWMEI,There are SO MANY good one liners in this season. Much better then the first. I can't wait for the third!!!,1240876800,,107,4.142857142857143
3700533,4,B001MVWMEI,"This tv show is a riot!
Nice to see that the ""community"" funny in some of the jokes!
Can't wait for another season to be released!",1239753600,,130,4.038461538461538

8321985,5,B001MVWMEI,Bought season 1&2 at the same time...remembered watching this on LOGO when it aired and enjoying it. NO apologies to anyone  equal opportunity offenders-nothing is off limits from gay to str8 to religion or politics. If you get offended easily this is NOT for you: if you ahve a sense of humor that has a twist to it then it is.,1475971200,,328,4.377049180327869
8321986,5,B001MVWMEI,FUNNY SHOW,1466121600,,10,4.5
8321987,5,B001MVWMEI,"I really enjoyed this series and it was nice to see the show again after not seeing it for ages. It shows it's age already with some of the pop culture references and the series ends on an unresolved cliffhanger but I still find it silly, raunchy, and enjoyable. Definitely not for kids.",1423526400,,287,4.433962264150943
8321988,5,B001MVWMEI,"The CD arrived in great condition and the show is so funny, its worth having the CD because your going to want to watch it again.  But not for kids.",1402444800,,148,3.933333333333333
8321989,5,B001MVWMEI,Just as funny and well thought out as the first series. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good laugh.,1392854400,,106,4.35
8321990,4,B001MVWMEI,Second season of Rick and Steve builds on the first by bringing a baby into the lesbian family.  Can gays and lesbians ever get along?  Can parents and their gay children have meaningful relationships?  Can a decent gay parody of the Wizard of Oz happen?  These and many more questions are dealt with in the second season.,1390867200,,322,4.5964912280701755
8321991,5,B001MVWMEI,"This ground-breaking animated series is too funny for words--gay humor on a scale never before seen in an animated series, or any series.  Stereotypes and L.G.B.T. memes that are ripe fodder for the comedic genius of the writers.  Two seasons was not enough!  A truly unique series, and bust-your-sides funny! I recommend this series, big time!",1369958400,,344,5.107142857142857
8321992,4,B001MVWMEI,"The show is great. It's a shame LOGO didn't bring it back.  Beats the heck out of Teen Mom, though.",1369353600,,99,3.95
