3464872,1,B001AR011U,"The title is the best thing about this stinker. Sounds like a new age novelist dispensing second rate wisdom. And what we get is third rate wisdom. Poor Matthew Perry must raise his young siblings after dad offs himself and mom konks out. Sis, Ginnifer Goodwin, is a you know what and  Ben Foster wanders around like a dazed holy man. The mentally ill are supposed to be smarter than us in these films. Send the local DPA more of your tax money because these losers need to be locked up for sure. They're nuts.

The scene of liberation where Matt Perry has to do something really awful to his daffy neighbors lawn, jeech, embarrassing, awful, so uncool. Couldn't he just poison the dog?",1227225600,3,686,4.524193548387097
3464873,5,B001AR011U,Its really great to see that Matthew Perry from Friends is still hard at work. This is a really strong movie. I can totally relate to the family situation and the whole thing is so heartfelt. Also loved Hillary Swank and Ginnifer Goodwin.,1226188800,2,238,4.558139534883721
3464874,2,B001AR011U,"Essentially this dysfunctional film implodes on itself in numerous ways, so much so that any description of the plot or otherwise would just be boring. The only two reasons to see this would be to watch the range that Ben Foster and Ginnifer Goodwin have. I liked Foster in 3:10 to Yuma and I think this role helped show his variety, as with Goodwin.

This is not a film to grab if you think Hillary Swank, Perry or Graham do anything special. Swank has 5 scenes, Perry spends half the film on a toilet (toilet humor does not work for me anymore) and Graham just seemed to miss it. Watching Perry scoop dog crap up well over ten times didn't work for me either. I like the films from First Look, but this one doesn't meet the grade of competency, except for Foster building a solid foundation - and when I think about it he actually had more screen time than anyone, so maybe they should change the cover art to him.",1224288000,10,916,4.325581395348837
3464875,2,B001AR011U,"Spanning 1 hour at 20 minutes this movie feels much longer and not necessarily in a pleasant way. Although some of the subjects and explorations this movie takes are genuine and interesting, there's too much of the oddity in here to be truly appreciated. This is not the best dysfunctional family drama out there and, by the end of the film, nor do we really care about whether it is.",1219881600,8,384,4.5

8278898,3,B001AR011U,"Birds of America tries to be amusing and unusual but doesn't truly make it. I'd recommend watching this for some good performances by Matthew Perry, Ben Foster, Ginnifer Goodwin and Lauren Graham. Hilary Swank's talent is largely wasted on a rather small role and the toilet humor (with Perry's character literally spending huge amounts of time sitting on the toilet) didn't work too well for me, either. However, the movie does flow along and the cinematography impressed me. The script is just average but then again the musical score wasn't all that bad.

Physics teacher Morrie Tanager (Matthew Perry) yearns for tenure; and after seven years of teaching he is finally eligible for it--as long as his next door neighbor and boss/quasi -friend Paul (Gary Wilmes) gives Morrie political support. Trouble is, Morrie and his wife Betty (Lauren Graham) can't stand snooty Paul and his wife Laura (Hilary Swank); but they lead a very straight laced life merely to get in good with Paul and Laura. Worse trouble for Morrie comes when he is chronically constipated (for months, he says?) and his nutty brother Jay (Ben Foster) and his rather loose sister and also nutty sister Ida (Ginnifer Goodwin) descend upon their household just as Morrie is finally up for tenure. This, of course, drives Morrie and Betty crazy; they are also embarrassed and ashamed of Jay and Ida whenever Paul and Laura see them. Moreover, Morrie and Betty fight over whether they should start trying to have a baby and Morrie is the polar opposite of Jay and Ida.

There's still more where this came from; and there are a few plot twists that will surprise you. The movie itself is nothing truly special; but it is light entertainment and that does have its value. I recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who like quirky comedies might consider this--although I would walk and not run to get it. It's average.",1301875200,2,1904,4.819571865443425
8278899,5,B001AR011U,"This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Surprisingly so, because it is habitually rated just average on the various sites like Amazon and IMDB. People don't seem to understand the very deep and beautiful psychology of this movie, which ultimately culminates in discovering what and where a person's real freedom is. Not in a political way, but in a liberating, ""life's journey"" kind of way. This movie is beautifully written, which is a tricky matter when dealing with this level of intellectualism. It stops short of being preachy or over-written. It is perfect! The casting is excellent too. Each character has great depth (or shallowness) that is magnificently represented by the actors chosen for each role. The pacing is also very well done, as is the score and the camera work. All in all, when it was over, I was ready to start watching it all over again. I really actually wish the whole story would have stretched much longer. It was sheer delight.

A movie about recognizing the chains that bind you and the love that frees you.",1300060800,2,1050,4.737704918032787
8278900,4,B001AR011U,"BIRDS OF AMERICA is not a cinematic version of Lorrie Moore's best selling collection of short stories by the same name.  This little tale of a dysfunctional family was written by Elyse Friedman, a Canadian novelist and screenwriter (Then Again, Long Short Story, Waking Beauty) whose works are summed up by the author: ""If I had to sum up [my characters] in one word, I'd say `outsiders.' There's not one particular source from where I get my inspiration. It comes from different places. I get it from life, and ideas pop into my head. I file them away and sooner or later it's time to deal with them, whether in screenplay, book, or poem or whatever it happens to be."" Craig Lucas (Longtime Companion, Prelude to a Kiss, The Dying Gaul) joins Friedman in bringing this strange little story about outsiders and insiders, all living together under one bizarre roof.

Morrie (Matthew Perry) is the older brother who raised his free-spirited siblings Jay (Ben Foster) and Ida (Ginnifer Goodwin) after the death of their parents. Their lives have gone in different directions: Morrie is a professor in line for tenure that happens to be at the mercy of his fellow academician Paul (Gary Wilmes) who lives next door to Morrie and his sturdy but 'it's time to start a family' wife Betty (Lauren Graham). Paul and his obsessive compulsive gardening wife-new-mother Laura (Hilary Swank) do all the right things, a trait Morrie and Betty try to emulate to assure Morrie's getting tenured, a move that will assure Betty that motherhood can be approached.

Into this strained atmosphere drops Jay recovering from an accident (he lay on the freeway and was hit but not killed).  Alone (he is married to a young girl Gillian (Zo Kravitz) but does not share this information at first) Jay moves into Morrie's attic and continues his strange life pattern, imposing his Vegan style on the family and eventually inviting his equally looney sister Ida to move in, too: Ida takes the basement. The two siblings proceed to cause minor crises and dilemmas for Morrie, more or less resulting in Morrie's being alienated from his 'important' neighbors.  How Morrie and Betty adjust to their new found way of life and its consequences provides an ending to the story.

The film is slight and begs indulgence in some of the sidebars that are less than contributing to the film as a whole, but the cast is very good: Ben Foster and Ginnifer Goodwin continue to impress as they polish their acting skills.  The story is a little on the crazy side, but it does provide another way of viewing a dysfunctional family.  Grady Harp, March 11",1299369600,2,2610,4.797327394209354
8278901,5,B001AR011U,"I just watched again this movie and I'm surprised about how much I like it and how many messages are passed between the lines. There are little touches here and there that make this movie not explicitly didactic (which usually happens nowadays, and is so hideous), allowing our personal questions to rise. Like, when in the end the ""break all the rules outsider guy"" realizes even that motto can imprison life experiences and bending that, although a paradox, can make room to other nice moments shared.
The director and the actors could have easily overdone it and blown the recipe. Instead, they give believable performances with true soul.

8278904,4,B001AR011U,"A quirky family trying to hang onto their sanity struggles to be there for one another, even as they are each emotionally falling apart. Mathew Perry stars as the sibling that had to grow up too fast after his dad has an 'accident' (or did he?) and his mother dies, leaving him to care for his younger siblings at the age of eighteen. His early struggles leave him rigid and fearful of change, or standing up for himself. When his strange sister and unbalanced brother come to stay with him his control over his life unravels so far that he may never be able to pull it together again. A look at unique and bizarre characters in this story of a family flailing along, trying to hold their heads above water and nearly taking each other under in the process.

8278905,2,B001AR011U,"I love Matthew Perry, but he needs someone to help him pick better films. I like films about dysfunctional families, but this movie was a sub-par example of the genre. This movie had the elements of a promising film but the content of the scenes was not clever, humorous, or perceptive enough. (Though there is one scene that sticks in my memory involving smoking marijuana that I thought was authentic/original/cool.)

Instead of this, if you haven't seen it, see The Safety of Objects, a film that my subconscious keeps returning to months after seeing it.",1227398400,6,558,4.873684210526315
