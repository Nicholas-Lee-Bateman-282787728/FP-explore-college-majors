298105,5,6300248569,Follows book except for end.  Wish this could be made into DVD.  Have worn out tape format.,948672000,4,91,4.294117647058823
298106,5,6300248569,"Okay, let me weigh in with my two cents in the Great Debate over BBC vs. A&E:
Stayed closest to the book:  BBC, no question.
Best Elizabeth Bennet:  Close, but I have to give this one to BBC.
Best Darcy:  BBC, by  a country mile.  Colin Firth just didn't look the part.  David Rintoul's  acting may have been a bit wooden, but he brought out Darcy's reserved and  inhibited character.  And he looks gorgeous!
Best Jane Bennet:  BBC.  She  brought out Jane's essential goodness, sensitivity and intelligence, as  well as her common sense.  Whoever thought she was ""catty"" in the  BBC version, must have mistaken her for Kitty.  A&E's Jane whined too  much.
Best Mr. Bennet:  BBC in a walk.
Best Mrs. Bennet:  Tie.  Delightfully ditzy in both productions.
Best Mr. Collins:  BBC.  Klutzy  and pompous, just like in the book.
Best Lady Catherine:  A&E, hands  down.  A real Gorgon, just like she was in the book.
Best Wickham:  Close, but A&E was better.
Best Mary and Kitty:  BBC wins in both  characters.
Best Bingley:  Tie, although I really liked the A&E  character.
Best Bingley's Sisters:  BBC.  The characters in the A&E  version looked ridiculous.
Best Uncle and Aunt Gardiner:  BBC,  especially Mrs. Gardiner.  My favorite character in this  production.
Although I enjoyed the A&E production, the BBC version is  Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice'.  And at less than half the price of  A&E, it's a helluva bargain!",947808000,45,1421,4.802521008403361
298107,5,6300248569,"Some of the most beautiful lines of dialogue are butchered in the A&E version.  This version preserves the beauty of the language, which makes the novel great.  I also much prefer Elizabeth Garvie's rendering of the  main character to the A&E version, although I agree that Mr. Darcy's  character is very wooden.  Otherwise, it's the better of the two.",944784000,7,352,4.898305084745763
298108,1,6300248569,"This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice suffers from an unfortunate screenplay. Fay Weldon has done a gross disservice to Jane Austen by continually putting the words of one character in the mouth of another. The  Bennet sisters lose all individuality in this adaptation. The serious,  studious Mary is shown gossiping and socializing. The kind-hearted Jane is  shown catty and mean-spirited. The 17-year old Kitty is miscast as a woman  in her 30's. Weldon has thrown in absurdities such as Elizabeth's marathon  run from Lambton to Pemberly to look for her aunt and uncle. Elizabeth  Garvie makes a valiant effort to portray Elizabeth Bennet but is forced to  do numerous voice-over narratives from the novel that slow the action to a  crawl. Poor David Rintoul is the saddest of the cast. A man with a funny  looking head who is given little to do but walk about stiffly showing no  more emotion than a wooden Indian. This adaptation has its passionate  advocates but I would suggest renting it before spending a dime. The  BBC/A&E adaptation with Jenifer Ehle and Colin Firth is much superior.",943833600,37,1096,4.9289617486338795
298109,5,6300248569,"This version of Pride and Prejudice allows the characters to unfold, true to life, slowly.  The acting by Mr. Rintoul at first seems over-dramatic  and awkward, but soon his character seems grander for the markedness of his  performance.  I would recommend this version for all Jane Austen fans.",941241600,5,295,5.083333333333333
298110,5,6300248569,"This production evoked the 19th century; the costumes, scenery, houses, and  dance scenes made me feel as though I had been transported there.  The casting is terrific.  The woman playing Mrs. Bennett, for instance, or the  man playing Mr. Collins, were terrific.  They  were in stark contrast to  the refined Elizabeth and Darcy.  It made one acutely aware of how  different she is from her parents and their choice of suitors.",935798400,3,428,4.915492957746479
298111,5,6300248569,"I think this is the best version of this English classic to date.  Garvie presents a much more spirited and enjoyable Elizabeth compared to the A&E/Beckinsale mercenary one.  Rintoul is the strongest  characterization of Darcy I've seen, Olivier and Firth make him seem  vacillating and weak in comparison.  The only drawback is the usual inside  sets of the BBC, but the outdoor grandeur and the quality of the acting  make this show worthwhile viewing over and over.",920505600,6,468,5.0
298112,5,6300248569,It adds a face and a voice to the characters in the book instead of becoming a different story with the same name.  The cast is great.  The actors/actresses capture the feeling of the book without being dry.  Also a  wonderful video for anyone who just enjoys a good love story.,914112000,3,278,4.392156862745098
298312,1,6300248569,"I love this production of Pride and Prejudice.  I ordered the DVD because I wanted a better copy than I had from the VHS I had taped years ago off of PBS.  The first one we received was flawed; the DVD froze during episode 3.  I complained and Amazon sent me a new one.  It froze at exactly the same place, which led me to believe that the stock they were distributing was flawed.  I bridged the gap with the old VHS tape, and decided it wasn't worth the bother to try again.  Great production; very crappy DVD!",1513468800,,511,4.163265306122449

298315,4,6300248569,"Though this version does not have the action and energy of other versions, our family very much enjoyed it because it went into further detail on character development - especially the way the main character, Elizabeth Bennett, changed. We thought the acting of the two younger sisters could have been better but overall this was a good and enjoyable version.",1507680000,2,359,5.0

298321,5,6300248569,The best Pride and Prejudice movie. Love every minute of it,1497657600,2,59,4.454545454545454
298369,5,6300248569,"This is absolutely my favorite video production of Pride and Prejudice. The most recent movie with Knightly was horrendous. The 1995 TV series  was much better than that movie (especially Jennifer Ehle) but there was not really convincing for the time period due to the portrayal of Darcy as too blatantly sexually infatuated with Elizabeth (jumping in the lake to cool off etc).  In this BBC miniseries production, Elizabeth Garvie and (especially)  David Rintoul were perfection in their portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy and had a fabulous supporting cast. Unfortunately, David Rintoul really didn't buy into the ""women's novel"" material by his own admission. For me, too, Pride and Prejudice is not about love at all. Its about the need for a woman to marry as well off as possible because of the financial pressures in her family and real possibility of ruinous poverty without financial support.  The women in the book were not educated or trained (not even Elizabeth) and had no prospects of supporting themselves in any meaningful way even if they had been allowed to work as anything other than servants - which would have been devastating for them.  Thus, this is a book about money and how to respectably get a husband for the required support.  Love was really an add-on. Even Elizabeth knew her poor fate if one of the sisters did not marry well. This is a Cinderella story and just as fantastic because, in reality, Darcy would never have married Elizabeth.  And Bingly would have been unlikely to have come back for her sister Jane.  Such men acquired mistresses but married in their own class.  Jane Austen was well aware of this reality and had suffered a poor life after her father got sick and then died. But, its a charming fairy-tale and I love it because it was written
well and authentically in that time period.",1497571200,3,1834,4.8152866242038215
298370,2,6300248569,"Mrs. Bennett voice so shrill I could not understand her words so I did nofinish watching the DVD, Subtitles would help.",1497398400,,119,4.714285714285714
298371,3,6300248569,"The writing well reflects the novel.  Elizabeth Garvie does  a wonderful job as portraying Elizabeth Bennett, as does the portrayer of Mr. Collins. The director does a good job of enhancing the humorous aspect of Mr. Collins, although the version with Laurence Olivier is better.  Mrs. Bennett is grating.  Most of the directing is stiff.  David Rintoul, Darcy is merely a caricature of the man.  I think that Darcy is a difficult role to play, but his austerity needs to be tempered with humanity. The best Darcy I have seen is Olivier.",1497312000,,537,4.782608695652174
298372,5,6300248569,This is the version I see in my head when I read the book. It is the most true to the book.,1495152000,,91,3.1818181818181817
298373,1,6300248569,I'm a huge Jane Austen fan and was excited to see a production a hadn't seen before...practically unwatchable...horrible acting...Northanger Abbey was also included...I tried really hard but by 45 minutes in I just couldn't stand it anymore and pulled it out of my DVD player...,1494633600,,278,5.2

That being said I totally love every version of Pride and Prejudice, and this is no exception. I think it was done quite well. Wish it could be purchased in found in Hi Def. I purchased this DVD but it doesn't work properly  . . . most unfortunate for me. Still I love it and will watch it over and over again. Jane finds ways to really show us the women of her times, the highs and lows of being female and with such insight. I love her work.

298439,5,6300248569,"I really love this 1980 version of Pride and Prejudice. Even more than the 2005 Keira Knightley version and the 1995 BBC Colin Firth version that everyone loves. It is just so beautifully done. The characters are true to the book and the costumes and locations are perfect. Lizzy is a mix of both Jennifer Ehle(1995) and Keira Knightley(2005) in temperament which makes her more like the book in my opinion. The first one I ever saw was the 2005 version and I always thought that the 1995 version is a little too reserved. This version fixes all of that. Lizzy smiles and flirts like the book says. Its beautiful.

The only problem I have with this version is that it cuts out one of my favorite scenes from the book/other movies where Mr. Bennett and Lizzy talk about how her feelings have changed for Mr. Darcy after the second wedding proposal. This is a beautiful exchange between father and daughter and it was sorely missing in this version.",1489363200,6,947,4.603550295857988
298440,2,6300248569,"While the product itself arrived as expected and was of good condition the movie itself was found lacking.  Pride and prejudice is one of my all time favorite stories, and while this does a sufficient job of following the story, it is by far my least favorite adaptation of the story. This production seems tedious to watch and additionally the appearance of the 5 sisters in this version is hard to keep track of. Their costumes hair and appearance are so similar that I have a hard timekeeping track of who is who and it is aggravating.",1488758400,,538,4.546391752577319

The quality of the playback of the DVD is what I  base this rating on. The recording of Pride and Prejudice episode 3 is completely problematic- it skips, freezes and then eventually does not play at all.  I tested it out on three different DVD players and the same result happened each time.  I see that there are other customers who have experienced the same problem so I believe it to be something inherent to the reproduction of this merchandise.

From my phone conversations with the BBC they were just becoming aware of the malfunctions in the production run of this disc. This disc DID NOT come with any return information.

298616,4,6300248569,"I'll start by saying I liked it overall.  After years of watching the other more notable productions of Jane Austen's P&P (many, many viewings), I will admit it was hard to get into this one at first.  The production value is definitely more ""soap opera-ish"", i.e., lighting, film method, etc., but once you give it a chance and get into the story, it's not too bad and worth owning as part of your collection, especially since I paid so little for the miniseries on Amazon.  The acting is just a shade over the top, but I'll be willing to concede that I wasn't around at that place during that period way back when, so I'd be as qualified to testify as to how things are on the moon, much less how they acted in the English countryside.  I was going to give it 3 stars at first, but they tried so hard :), and it's Jane Austen for pete's sake.  I will say this, don't let this one be your first viewing, try first the wonderful miniseries starring Colin Firth, then follow up with the more recent movie starring Keira Knightley, in that order.  Then read the book, it'll make so much more sense, haha.",1457136000,,1102,4.351219512195122

298619,5,6300248569,"This is the best version in its ability to convey the total atmosphere of Jane Austen's world, primarily due to Elizabeth Garvey's remarkable portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett.  She is the only actress who conveys the subtle balance of Elizabeth's wit and intelligence with the emotional restraint that is the essence of the historical period.  No other actress has a clue as to this complexity of character and plays Elizabeth with a modern feminist attitude.  The 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier conveys the characters well,  but has too much of the Hollywood re-interpretation to be considered accurate.  David Rintoul is a little stiff in his interpretation of Darcy's pride, but he improves as the story goes on.  All the other characters are exactly as I see them in the novel.

I'm thrilled that I now own the dvd of the 'dramatisation,' that since the remake of the '1995', version, has been lost to the UK- (we can no longer buy this version or indeed, see it on television here). Though I also do love the '1995,' version. The delivery reached me on the exact day that 'Amazon. Com,' said it would, my only problem was the region difference which meant I was somewhat delayed in viewing the dvd.  I couldn't watch it on my dvd player, and had to wait until my laptop was repaired to enjoy it.

Perhaps it's the difference between a British approach and an American approach (although I've loved most of what I've seen from BBC, so I can't be sure that's the problem), but I found the production choppy, lines often seemed simply recited and other times over-acted.  I've very much liked the other three productions of Pride and Prejudice I've seen (Colin Firth version first, Greer Garson next, and Keira Knightly version a little less than the first two), but this one didn't draw me into the story.

298775,5,6300248569,"First of all, I had read many works of Jane Austin, including of course ""Pride and Prejudice"". Later I saw the movie by Lawrence Olivier, which did not do justice to the book. In the '80, I saw BBC's mini-series, which I consider it superb and bought the VHS set. With my advanced age, hearing-disadvantaged became my problem. VHS did not have captions or subtitles.  I bought two DVDs with subtitles by Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle, and by Knightly. The latter was poorly presented, in which the talent of Dame Judith Dench was a waste. The former was well done. There are defects: Ms. Ehle was talented but not convincing as a twenty year old. The direction concentrated on the principals, Elizabeth and Darcy, but neglected the other characters. It was my joy to see the reissue of BBC on DVD. According to Amazon's product description, it suppose to have English subtitle. With eager waiting, I ordered the DVD. Unfortunately the promised subtitle was no where to be seen. Amazon did refund my order due to misrepresentation of the ad. But the disappointment is still there. I shall only comment on some of the advantage on the BBC show that the others are lacking: The snotty Miss Bingley is exactly what I pictured in the book. The pompous and stupid Mr. Collins was everything that Austin described. Last of all, Jane was beautiful and Elizabeth was not far back and was blessed with a pair of beautiful eyes seemingly talking and showing intelligence. Would the Amazon comments convince the company to reissue the BBC DVD with real English subtitle?",1432252800,3,1554,4.798507462686567

298812,5,6300248569,"I love Austen in general, and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is my favorite version, for serveral reasons. The first is that it follows the book much more closely, in terms of plot and the characters themselves. Jane, for example, is supposed to be extremely beautiful, which she is in this version. The Colin Firth version Jane was a good actress and portrayed the role well, but was not classically beautiful enough. This Jane is almost exactly as one would expect her to look.
I also preferred this Lizzy by just a hair, she was much more active and energetic, the Lizzy in the other version is just a touch too mellow. I like the two Mr. Darcy's equally. Lady Catherine was better in this version too. Lydia was better in the other version, everything else was about even.
 Still, this version is an excellent addition to any Austen fan's collection. I was very disappointed that Amazon not only took it off prime instant video, but took it off instant video altogether. The page is completely gone. I would have gladly bought it, given the opportunity to do so, had I known they were completely doing away with it. Fail, Amazon. Fail.

298814,5,6300248569,"This miniseries was my introduction to the world of Jane Austen.  I watched this version in the 80's on PBS.  I fell in love with it and ended up buying the book and reading it.  I became incensed with Victorian era romance, and there was no better time, as PBS in the ensuing years, started showing more Victorian romances (i.e. Mansfield Park, Persuasion, Sense & Sensibility, Northanger Abbey, etc.) and I watched most of them and luckily I am able to collect my favorites on Amazon and at reasonable prices.  Like other reviewers, I have watched the other versions of Pride and Prejudice, and yes, I've also purchased them, and still watch them to this day.  I'm not going to go into a lengthy review because some of the other reviewers have already done a pretty superb job in reviewing the versions, one vs. the other; comparing, characters, sets, scenery, you name it, it's covered.  There is no need for me to recount, I actually would not be as good at it as they are.  They do a far superior job than I think I could do.  The only thing I will repeat is that it is a matter of what you're looking for which will determine which version you're going to like.  Personally, I liked all of the versions.  Okay, not equally, but I think that they each had just a different ""flavor"" to offer.  The 80's version followed the book more.  The A&E version was more lavish or ""Hollywood- ish.""  The BBC 2005 version was really shortened, but I think that is because it wasn't being done as a miniseries, but more like just a movie version.  I didn't like it at first but the more I watched it I got to like it.  I didn't mind that some characters were left out, I guess they did that due to ""time constraints?""  I think as a movie it could have been far superior to the A&E miniseries if only a few of the scenes in it had flowed together better or more storyline had been added to certain scenes (some of the scenes just needed more time, I felt they ended too quickly, or didn't make any sense where they ended.  But I did prefer the cast of characters in the 2005 version better than in the A&E version, but that is just my personal preference.  To me Matthew McFadyen and Kiera Knightley became Darcy & Elizabeth, they played the characters superbly and I wish there had been a sequel movie with these characters, it could have been dynamite.  But I will still watch all the versions of P&P, I still watch them.  I think I'm going to go watch my all time favorite now!!!",1426809600,3,2473,4.36980306345733

If you want the best ending ever watch Keira Knightly. If you want a sweeter story that isn't true to the book watch Lawrence Olivier. Don't bother with his one.",1425772800,3,448,4.2823529411764705

In my opinion it is not; however, it is above average for movie versions of this story.  It is certainly better than the 2006 Universal Studios distortion of Austen's story.  Every version changes dialogue to include the narration to make the story more complete, and every version changes scenes to be consistent with the director's interpretation.  This BBC miniseries stays quite close to the novel except in characterizations.  Austen describes Mr. Bennett as laughing at his wife, not openly criticizing her, and Mrs. Bennett is described in the novel as self-centered and empty headed, not a shrew.  Charlotte is totally supportive of her husband, never openly laughing or criticizing him even to Elizabeth in Austen's writing. Also, Darcy is presented in the movie as so lacking in emotional expression, even at Pemberley, it is hard to understand why Elizabeth is attracted to him. The ending comes remarkably quickly, but that is probably because of the time restraints of covering so complex a story in only five episodes.  The film is worth viewing; it portrays Austen's view of English culture in her era excellently.",1420761600,,1260,5.151960784313726

My opinion may be colored by having seen several other versions of the film, from the 1940 Laurence Olivier on. I do watch this version often [I'll give it a solid B] but my favorite is the Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth one [ A] - some time line issues]  with its superb cast.  And if we are to compare versions, some of the characters in the Kiera Knightley version are way off the mark [ D], particularly Mr. Bennett, while the 1940 [ E-] bears little resemblance to the book.",1420329600,2,810,4.422818791946309

298970,5,6300248569,"Adapting any novel, let alone a beloved one, to film presents inherent difficulties because of time constraints and the more discursive nature of writing.  The emotional lynchpin of Pride of Prejudice: the change from initial dislike of by Elizabeth to love for the proud and unpleasant Mr Darcy into love is something that is remarkable and must be explained.  Finally, much of the joy of reading the novel depends on social morays and ideas about expressing emotion that are very different from our time.  This means things are done very indirectly and only rarely are true feelings expressed.  This version (BBC), the Firth/Ehle version, and  the Knightly version all solve these problems differently.
  The Knightly version is the least true to the social morays of the time. While it has the highest production values, time constraints forced it leave out the most of all these versions.  Social morays of class for the time are violated willy nilly.  It turns Elizabeth into something of a romantic heroine and Darcy into Heathcliff.  Not so much that they are unrecognizable, but distinctly different,  yet I am not embarrassed to say I enjoyed it.
  The Firth/Ehle version has much going for it.  In my opinion, it stays closest to the spirit and letter of the novel with only one inserted scene (Darcy speaking to Caroline Bingley after Lydia's elopement) that I dislike because I had always imagined it very differently!  It has good production values.  The scenery is wonderful.  Firth is excellent.  I waver on Ehle because she seems too mature on occasion to rush to the hasty opinions that she does, but the is a mere quibble.  Ehle is excellent.
  In comparison, this version suffers from a major, unavoidable, lack of production values.  I happen to like the Mr. Darcy in this version very much, but it is very difficult to see the emotions in his eyes when they are in a deep shade because of poor lighting.  He is not the only actor or actress who must deal with this problem.  He also suffers because he did not go on to become a big star like Firth.
  More substantively, this version, like all the versions inevitably had to do, moves dialogue between characters, adds and deletes scenes, and generally alters the novel for dramatic or other reasons.  The opening is jarring to those familiar with the book but perhaps not so to others.  I could accept it better.
  In order to solve the problem that a book allows one to hear the thoughts of a character whereas a movie has more difficulty with this, it includes voice overs and near soliloquies by Elizabeth.  I disliked this because I had read the book and understood what was happening without them.  They only slowed down the pace and stated, in most instances, the ""obvious.""
  It is where the voice-overs and near soliloquies of Elizabeth vary from the book that this version causes me trouble.  Particularly I disliked how these writers changed her reaction to Darcy's first proposal.  I cannot write more without spoiling the difference, but they added several words that make her very different in a voice over.  I liked her much less and I did not understand her violent rejection of his offer--the book says she cried for thirty minutes it displeased her so much.  Elizabeth then goes on to violate Darcy's confidence (I don't think it is in the book but I have not checked).  Both these changes were probably made to prepare the reader for the coming change in her feelings.  Fair enough, but I think much more is lost than is gained.
  This version also made changes to Elizabeth's visit to Pemberton that do not work for me.  The thrill in the book comes from Elizabeth's changing understanding of herself and Darcy and from the Garner's realization that something more is going on between Darcy and Elizabeth than Elizabeth is letting on.  This is shown by Darcy behaving not like a ""great man"" and not by someone telling us, and by Elizabeth's spontaneous and unthinking but very feeling revelation to Darcy in private of the contents of the letter that she has just received.  Admittedly, this is very difficult to show on screen today and the other versions all change and reduce the visit to Pemberton, but this version commits an error in having Elizabeth reveal the contents of the letter to Darcy while she is in the presence of her aunt and uncle.
  In Georgian England, Darcy would never have been in the room if Elizabeth could talk to her aunt and uncle about news that was so devastating and so shameful to her upper class family and to her new feelings--as hard as it is for us to believe that a youthful ""indiscretion"" by one child could dramatically affect the reputation and fortunes of the whole family.  Such secrets were not revealed to people outside the family but tried to be kept hidden, and doing it would be a grave, inexplicable error on Elizabeth's part who knew the rules and usually played by them even if she made fun them and even disparaged some of them  in private.  The logic of the scene is badly weakened.  I don't know why the writers and director made these choices.
  So I would give this version 4.5 stars if that were possible.  It's Austin.  It's good despite some errors.  If poor lighting, bad sound, and occasionally very flat scenes frustrate you, then I would recommend liberal use of the fast forward or not watching at all.",1420156800,2,5359,4.727861771058316

She was more true to the actual book.  In the A&E version, Mrs. Bennett is portrayed as somewhat vulgar.  Jane Austen never wrote her character as vulgar.  Austen meant her to be extremely silly, but not vulgar.  Both miniseries are far superior to the more recent movie with Keira Knightly.

299044,5,6300248569,"When I finished watching this BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, I told myself ""THIS I could watch every year.""
Like many others, I, too, noticed the over-the-top irritating voice of the mother (which Darcy himself comments upon!), the rather lifeless and severe portrayal of Darcy, and, of course, the studio feel of some of the scenes. (By the way, my favourite Elizabeth and Darcy remain the well-voiced pairing of old pros Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier in MGM's very watered-down, condensed version.)
In terms of story development, this is by far my favourite film version of Jane Austen's novel. Austen's world is much more than romantic love; it is an exploration of an entire world of relationships.
A director's keen eye and a writer's authentic ear entices the 21st century viewer deeper and deeper into the peculiar quirks and qualms of Elizabeth's world. One can feel the suffocatingly bored existence of the unmarried sisters, and realize how remaining in one's childhood home might sometimes be the worst fate of all (is Mr. Bennett's library the first ""man cave"" in literature?). Elizabeth's parents do not shine in this version and indeed both are found lacking by Elizabeth.
No friendships with the servants here (I can barely stomach ""Downtown Abbey"" with all its modern-day intrusiveness of political correctness and whitewashed presentations of class and behaviour). The servants are mere shadows, just another delineation of the trenches that exist between the social classes that marked one's fate. Most importantly of all, we also see the never-changing face of human nature that can be unaccepting, judgemental, and peevish. How does one make the best choice in what is the most important decision one can make in one's life?
This BBC miniseries draws the viewer into ALL the relationships that matter and affect Elizabeth -- and Darcy's is just one of them. And when it comes to marriage, it was much more than a meeting of like minds, and much, much tougher to accomplish.

299082,4,6300248569,"This P&P was different for me than the other two versions I have watched. The most recent version is only decent in my opinion for an exceptionally abbreviated version of the lesser important parts of the book. Every time I see that version I like Keira Knightley less and less in playing Elizabeth Bennett also. It just doesn't come across as genuine to me. Mrs. Bennett definitely steals the show. I think she is the best Mrs. Bennett to date, and Mr. Bennett is also probably the best to be found. Okay, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh was excellent also.

The BBC/A&E version is essentially wonderful, and probably still my favorite of these three that I have seen. I think the Lizzy in that version is a good balance and wit and respect, and Colin Firth does a wonderful job of transitioning from cold, hard Mr. Darcy to seeing his true nature. That version is also mostly accurate to the book.

This version is also fairly accurate, and I definitely enjoyed watching it. The feel of the movie was entirely different though. I still haven't been able to put my finger on it. David Rintoul was a sensational Mr. Darcy. I think he pulled off the high-and-mighty Mr. Darcy far better than either of the others. While the transition was there in his character I felt that Lizzy did more of the transforming than Darcy in this version. I felt just a touch more warmth would have completely sold me on David being ""the"" Mr. Darcy... and he might be my favorite Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth Garvie did a very good job of portraying Elizabeth Bennett. I found it interesting to watch this portrayal because Lizzy was not as saucy and, while still being quite firm in her opinion, was respectful and considerate while speaking her mind. I think this version showed a more accurate version of what Lizzy probably would have actually been like in personality and disposition. Though, since I was used to thinking of her with a tad more spice I think I slightly prefer Jennifer Ehle.

I must say all of the Mr. Collins in these movies were excellent choices. The one in this 1980 version was over the top. I could not stand the man (which, of course, is good in this case). My biggest complaint about all three movies is that no one has translated Georgiana to the screen properly. That does irk me some.

I would definitely recommend this version of P&P even with its 4 hour running time. Break it up into segments if you need to, but I suggest watching it in one sitting for its full effect. I give it two thumbs up! :-)

EDIT: This is actually my favorite version of Pride and Prejudice now. It grows on your leaps and bounds each time I see it (which has only been like 2 or 3). I think that Rintoul is the absolute best Darcy, and I think his portrayal does that best at showing how, yes, Mr. Darcy grew in character, but also was misunderstood. Also, I think Lizzie is the most accurately portrayed. While the filmography certainly doesn't win any awards, I think the rest of the movie steals the show.",1413331200,2,2990,4.509225092250922
299083,5,6300248569,"This version is absolutely bewitching. I almost quited watching it after the first few minutes, because of the not so good resolution and all, but as soon as Elizabeth Bennet came out, I suddenly felt a stir, and a voice in my mind told me that, ""this is absolutely THE Elizabeth"", as she could be, in real life, had the novel itself to be real.
I love the novel, the A&E version in 1995 and Keira Knightly's movie in 2005, but this one most certainly secures the place as the best of them all, in my opinion. I give the credit for it mainly because of Elizabeth Garvie, the actress for Elizabeth Bennet, whose air and performance, I believe, best captured, what in my understanding and imagination,  the true character of the Elizabeth Bennet in the novel.
Elizabeth is a good-looking, moderate handsome girl, but not so beautiful and attractive as she was in Keira Knightly's version. In my imagination, she has the kind of beauty that, when among a whole room of other handsome ladies, not so dazzling, not so pretty as would be so singled out as her sister Jane would have been; but still, when you get to know her, listen to her conversation and even talk to her, you'll find her appearance and looks so perfectly suited for her wisdom, sensibility, and excitable nature as a young lady. Appearance was never what truly made Lizzy valued, but certainly her looks must be consistent with a superiority of  mind, not more, and not less. Jennifer Elle in 1995's version is a little bit old in age(appears to me in the make-up) and too much of serenity in her air to me, while Keira Knightly is undoubtly too pretty to be Elizabeth and, maybe just a little bit too lively and smiles a little bit too much to be a lady at that time(but of course, the style of the movie was not meant to be a faithful interpretation of the English Classic style in the first place).
In this 1980 version, however, Elizabeth Garvie had brought what is really the essence of ""Elizabeth Lizzy Bennet"" to her perfomance, as I would put it: a very subtle balance between truly handsome and ""tolerable"", especially when she was meditating with her thoughts; a pair of eyes that anyone would assume a sensible, wise owner, with a little perfectly combined fond of teasing with really insightful observations; And her smile, constantly, is a very good balance between being natural, honest, while maintaining the reasonable amount of self-constrains.
There are so many scenes that can well support my high regard for her performance. In Episode I, after Elizabeth was slighted by Mr Darcy at their first meeting, they met again on a ball at Sir Willian's House, where Elizabeth, and Charlotte, noticed that Mr Darcy was constantly looking at her and listening to their conversations. She stood up with her friend, walked in front of Mr Darcy, and teased him with frankness on overhearing their conversation. And she performed in such a subtle way, that everyone can tell Elizabeth cared not for Darcy, but, after fully showing her characters as a sensible, lively young lady with excellent judgment, no one in Darcy's place would not be attracted to her.
Another scene that is really amazing is when she was reflecting on her rejection to Darcy's proposal, at the end, she suddenly realized(through voice-narrating) that it is truly a compliment for her to be proposed by Darcy, and she was flattered, and gave a very sweet and comfortable smile. That smile totally got the feeling. I felt it very natural and true for this kind of feeling she should have, any lady in her position should have it, and it is actually the sole foundation of her later affection for Darcy, because, after all, she did care about his opinion for her: his good opinion would still make her happy. The actress's performance was just wonderful.

The movie used voice-narrating to present some of the most important mediation that Elizabeth had in the novel, which is absolutely brilliant design. Combined with a faithful description of almost all of the scenes in the novel, this feature greatly helped audience to much better comprehend what Elizabeth had truly gone through with her feelings about Darcy, and what really constituted the transformation of her regards to him.
The cast is excellent, the lines are faithful, and the scenes are well prepared to be honest and natural. Although I found it not so good in two respects: firstly, the characters speak too fast sometime; secondly, some of the characters demonstrated too much of a dramatic reactions and performance, depriving the audience of a feeling of true life scenes, rather on stage. This especially goes true for Jane, in my opinion. The best Jane I would give for Rosamand Parker in 2005's version: beautiful, sensible, steady and with serenity.
Anyway, great version, every P&P fan should take the time and enjoy it. I feel fortunate to have the chance of appreciating such a adaption of one of my favorite novels as well as characters.",1412985600,3,4958,4.782963827304551

The acting was stiff and Elizabeth seemed to only be able to make a couple faces, one being bug eyes. That was suppose to indicate shock and surprise at what someone was saying but after a while it just looked silly. I understand the mother's character is suppose to be shrill, the father calm, and Mr. Darcy is a bit shy therefore looking stone faced and a little odd. The other versions are a little bit the same but done much, much better. Elizabeth plays better when she is written and acted as a bit more wise for her age and her close relationship with her father is very sweet.

299205,3,6300248569,"I may not be qualified to write this review because after trying to watch this 1980 adaptation three separate times, I could never bring myself to get through the entire thing.

Granted, it does adhere dogmatically to Austen's novel (which I've read dozens of times), that is one of the few more positive things I could say about this version. Elizabeth Garvie does a pretty good job playing Lizzie (Elizabeth Bennet) but her make-up is not at all true to that time period and of course, if you look too closely neither are the costumes. You can all but see the seams and zippers on some of the gowns which would not have been present in true Regency Era clothing. But then, I think this mini-series had a very strict production budget and it was produced at least 15 years prior to the A & E version.

The three things that really kept me from getting through the entire series were A) The very tinny or canned-like feeling from the film (it was more like watching a television play than a movie), and (sorry to some of the ladies who reviewed here and thought him to be handsome) David Rintoul's very stiff and over acted portrayal of Darcy combined with his beady eyes just made me uncomfortable watching him. Finally, C) Many of the actors in this series seemed to be performing on a stage and it felt like I was watching ""actors"" playing their roles as opposed to people in an actual story. And I could hear almost an echo of the actor's voices in some scenes (also probably due to a lower budget and poor sound/recording).

While the A & E (1995) version strayed in a few places from the novel - those additions or embellishments by the screenplay writer seemed to add to the quality of the story as opposed to taking from it. In fact, I would say that Jane herself would have thoroughly enjoyed the A & E version and might well have criticized the 1980 version for it's play-like rendition.

One of the main reviewers, Ms. Green, mentions that Jennifer Ehle in the 1995 mini-series did not have the ""fine eyes"" that Austen described Lizzie as having, yet, to me, Ehle looked much more like what I imagined Elizabeth Bennett to have looked like than Garvie. (Then again, there's that matter of the make-up gaffe on Garvie whereas you couldn't see eye make-up on Ehle). I also noticed that Jennifer Ehle had a natural sparkle and slight mischievousness to her eyes that I did not see with Garvie. Ehle also IMO to date has given the closest character of Jane Austen's Lizzie; the mischief, humor, wit, and charm that even Kiera Knightly (a fine actor in her own right) could not seem to match in the 2005 movie.

I do agree that Susannah Harker's ""Jane"" in the A & E version did not represent the true (physical) beauty of Jane Austen's description but she more than made up for that in capturing the sweet yet shy spirit and persona of Jane. In this series, Sabina Franklyn was quite pretty but didn't have near the depth of character portrayal as Harker.

I'm almost always a stickler for movies to follow their story (book) source as closely as possible - especially when it's a book as excellent as Pride and Prejudice. While the A & E version embellished in a few scenes, it also offered so much in the way of  outstanding performances including; Mr. Bennet's dry sense of irony and humor (I think Benjamin Whitrow has topped every other actor's portrayal - especially when he says that famous line about ""having been a constant companion"" of Mrs. Bennet's 'nerves' for some 20 years), Julia Sawalha's Lydia did such a vibrant and vivacious performance that she almost stole the show in a number of scenes. Julia went on to play an entirely different and quite loveable ""Dorcas Lane"" in the TV series ""Lark Rise To Candleford."" Whereas Natalie Ogle as Lydia Bennet in this 1980 television version wasn't near as charismatic or silly as Austen depicted her in the novel.

Priscilla Morgan as Mrs. Bennet, was much more subdued than Alison Steadman's highly strung and simultaneously amusing and irritating version - which again, to me seemed more like the character that Austen created in her book.

Again, the budget for this 1980 production was obviously a fraction of that of the A & E depiction for the latter had the most authentic and appealing costumes, lavishly beautiful sets and scenery (the outdoor filming of various parts of England was stunning) and the interiors of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Darcy's estates (filmed in real English estate homes) were equally as mesmerizing.

Malcolm Rennie's performance as Mr. Collins in this older version was certainly good but I've yet to see any actor command that character's shallow and silly attempt at social climbing as well as David Bamber in the A & E version.

Finally, when it comes to Mr. Darcy, there was no contest at all between Colin Firth's perfect balance between prideful snobbery and a haughty demeanor gradually thawed by the arrows of love (that he could not avoid for all of his attempts), and David Rintoul's staged and overly acted version.

While I just could not get far enough into this series to really offer a true assessment on Judy Parfitt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I can say - after watching the A & E series at least a half dozen times, that Barbara Leigh-Hunt seemed to epitomize this character completely. Even Dame Judy Dench didn't seem to reach the level of condescending snobbery that Leigh-Hunt achieved (of course Dench was in the 2005 version produced by Joe Wright, and therefore an entirely ""different animal"" of a film - so to speak).

If you love all things Austen and don't mind a stage-like set or the feeling you are watching a play instead of a movie, then I would suggest renting this older version of Pride and Prejudice, or, watching it on Prime Instant Video first. However, if you've already seen the A & E version and enjoyed it, be prepared for a much lower caliber of costumes, set styling, scenery and IMO, performances. It wasn't near as realistic or entertaining as the 1995 series.

I'm going to give this series one more shot in hopes I can weather it to the very end as it is actually the only performance of Pride & Prejudice that I've not watched all the way through, and while some certainly had their gaffes or flaws, they were always interesting enough to see them through to the end. (Don't get me started on the 1940 movie with two of my favorite actors; Greer Garson and Sir Laurence Olivier, who for no fault of their own were given a script that included a bizarre garden scene with archery, and the female characters wore dresses that were closer to the mid 1800s as opposed to the actual Regency Era or very early 1800s).

I think if one had to compare these two very different versions of Pride & Prejudice, it would be similar to comparing a plain (but pure) apple to a platter of exotic and delicious fruit.",1408492800,5,6854,4.615763546798029

299208,3,6300248569,"There are many things to enjoy about this version of Austen's Pride & Prejudice:
1.  The secondary characters are very believable.  Mr. Bingley's sisters, in particular, are very real......I never saw them as petty or mean, as the 1994 A&E version portrays them.  I was able to see Caroline Bingley through the eyes of her class and experiences, not as a vindictive, jealous shrew.

2.  This version stays very close to the original book and uses Elizabeth Bennett's diary entries to explain or move the plot along.

3.  The casting of each character is very well done.  You know whom everyone is, almost immediately.

The things I did NOT like about this production:
1.  Everyone speaks in the same tone.  There are no highs or lows....even when people are arguing.  But, this is very typical of ALL the BBC shows done in the 70's and 80's.  I did not feel any passion from the actors and therefore was not passionate about this show.

2.  It doesn't have Colin Firth.  Nothing against the actor in this series who play Mr. Darcy.  He looks and acts the part.....but, Colin Firth will forever be the one and only Mr. Darcy for me.

Essentially...anyone who loves Jane Austen will like this version of Pride & Prejudice for one reason or another.  But because there are so many versions available, there will always be things to like more ....Except for the 2005 movie with Keira Knightly.....I am sure Austen rolled over in her grave when she saw it.  It was a travesty to a beautiful piece of literature.",1407542400,3,1506,4.653992395437262

It's always fun to see how each actor will nuance their role - and this is a truly fine rendition.  I always like to see Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh (portrayed by the fabulous Judy Parfitt), praise herself and her daughter and look down on everyone else, only to be trumped by Elizabeth Bennett! And I don't know where they'd ever find a Mr. Darcy with a stronger, more determined jaw - he was almost always stonefaced, just like in the novel.

The cinematography is wonderful throughout. You feel as though you are part of a travelogue, accompanied by these characters from the past. Lovely.

There are 5 episodes of 54 minutes each, so it's a leisurely stroll through the lives of the Bennett family. And, as always, it ends with Mr. Bennett in his library announcing that if any gentleman shows up interested in his remaining single daughters he is ""at his leisure.""

Pride & Prejudice is a wonderful story by Jane Austin; this version is staged in 5 episodes, leaving a lot of situations with multiple scenes. The version is dated, but not that much since the story comes from the past anyway.

I thought the ensemble cast to be very talented in their various portrayals of characters. I have watched this repeatedly and, yes, Lizzy and Darcy are my favorites too. I like the way Miss Austin writes, allowing a feel for the era, the constraints of women in society, and showing basic character of people in general.

The thing that I will say is that I cannot understand how so many people could find this version in any way accurate to Miss Austen's text, or even remotely resembles the rhythm and cadence of her words. Unfortunately, I'll have to use *MAJOR SPOILERS* to prove my point.

I cannot find the atrocious proposal Charlotte Lucas in forced to endure in the second episode in the text, but that's a small matter. This is of course, an adaptation of literature, and as such, these liberties must sometimes be taken. But, I DO take issue with the fact that Elizabeth's refusal of Mr. Collins was absolutely *nothing* like the book! I also take issue with the fact that Charlotte Lucas brings the news of Mr. Bingley. I take EXTREME ISSUES with Elizabeth running like a hoyden through Lambton, to Pemberley! I take issue with the fact that the screenwriter clumsily mashed Miss Austen's sparkling prose and dialogue with overwrought wordiness that does nothing to highlight the greatness of the source material. In short, I don't find this version at all accurate! People say dialogue that didn't belong to them in the book, the events are sometimes out-of-sequence, and certain characters are trashed! Mary Bennett, a flirt, and wanting to dance with Mr. Darcy? Where did that come from? No, accuracy is not a virtue of this production.

Still, all this might have been forgiven if the direction had been better. Yes, I know this is shot more like a filmed play than a movie. BUT I've seen plays before, even a very good production of Shakespeare, and I know it's possible to speak more complex English than Miss Austen wrote with naturalness and true feeling. I think the Director told every actor, ""speak as fast as possible, breath as little as possible, and make sure that you don't actually like anyone else.""

As for the actors themselves... I'm sorry, they all either resemble paper dolls or wax statues. Not one of them gave even five honest, genuine moments of emotion! Elizabeth's ""fine eyes"" resembled a deer in the headlights. The actor who played Darcy had a face that couldn't move, a voice that rarely changed it's monotone, the most lifeless eyes I've ever seen, and he walked as if the costume designer had forced him into a corset. Granted, men did wear corsets as well as women in those days; but if he wasn't I can't account for his gate. I hope the poor man wasn't injured or something. As for the supporting cast, none of them impressed me with the sense that the cared about the characters they played at all.

Again, I'm not claiming to be an Austen expert, but I can't help but wonder if she would recognize humanity in any of the way her characters were portrayed.",1394496000,4,2852,4.641584158415841

299355,4,6300248569,"Simple because it is longer and can use far more dialog and scenes which is where the movies fail to do this story justice. I also like the more stern Mr. Bennett.

This does not get 5 stars because:
-Bennett sisters do not seem well cast and all look to be the same age
-Did not build up enough why Mr. Darcy falls for Ms. Elisabeth Bennett
-Elisabeth Bennett smiles too much and even after Mr. Darcy's proposal

The female lead for Elizabeth was alright, nothing to get excited about.  But the actor who played Mr Darcy was the poorest excuse of an actor in that role!!!  He showed absolutely no ability to play the part.  He walked around with this ridiculous look on his face, and walked like he was some puffed up peacock.  I don't know who on earth chose him for the part, but it was difficult watching this poor creature trying to play Mr. Darcy.

299357,3,6300248569,"This dramatization, while fairly accurate to the book, is a bit dry and at times boring.  Andrew Davies' adaptation (1995) adds substantially more entertainment value and stellar acting; Colin Firth is superb.",1392854400,2,209,5.53125
299358,5,6300248569,"I guess, in the back of my mind, I realized that another TV/movie-version of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" existed--you know, something other than A&E's 1995 offering with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. So when I announced to my husband around dinnertime the other day that I wanted to watch ""Pride and Prejudice"" again, and he clicked on Netflix, I suppose I wasn't surprised to see something OTHER than the A&E version available there. (Actually, the A&E version didn't appear at all.) So he turned on that--he's a fan, too--and we started watching it.

As so many others have outlined the plot already, I won't go into all that here, aside from saying that the story revolves around the Bennet family--complete with five daughters and no sons--who are hoping that at least one of their daughters will marry well into society. Eldest daughter Jane is the revered beauty, and she is thought to be preferred by the wealthy Mr. Bingley, who has recently moved into the neighborhood. But when second daughter, Elizabeth, clashes with Mr. Bingley's even wealthier friend, Mr. Darcy, things become rather complicated...

Let me just say, to watch the BBC version... well, at first, it was awkward. At least it was for me. I'm used to the 1995 cast, and their interpretation of Jane Austen's story and its characters. Elizabeth Garvie looked too ""eighties pretty"" to be Elizabeth Bennet in an empire-waisted dress. And David Rintoul as Darcy? He was very waxy and Ken doll-ish! Yet as my husband and I delved deeper into this BBC version of the story, the more I became comfortable with this other version, and the more I liked it. David Rintoul's Darcy is subtle and intense, and his aristocratic interactions with Elizabeth toy with the emotions and mind on many levels--not just one. Yet, dare I say, the 'garden scene' at the end with Elizabeth and Darcy was just the period-appropriate, uber-romantic conclusion to the clash between two personalities who have entertained readers for generations. It was perfect! (I must add, too, that David Rintoul was absolutely GORGEOUS in the last episode; it's as if he allowed the melting of Darcy's first impressions and pride to allow his own handsomeness to shine through.) So now I'm all giddy about P&P again, and I'm finding myself thinking about the story sporadically during the day. Ah, well.

I asked my husband which he preferred: the BBC version or the A&E version. He said the A&E version is more ""watchable"", and I agree that it is quite lush and much more polished than the BBC version--which often feels like you're watching a play. But I like plays! And my only real qualm about the casting in the BBC version is that Kitty is much too old, and her acting is not as good as it should be. Mary shines, though, and Lydia is fair enough although I think her counterpart in the A&E version trumps her. Jane seems more intelligent in the A&E version, too. However, the actor who played Mr. Collins in the BBC version did so perfectly! But what about Jennifer Ehle or Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet? Both have their strengths. I think Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth is very 'modern' and I consequently found Elizabeth Garvie's portrayal to be more realistic for the era. And I am very much besotted with David Rintoul now; Colin Firth was great  but, I'm sorry, I much prefer his predecessor as Darcy!

(Does it need to be said I refuse to watch the Keira Knightley movie version of P&P that came out a few years ago?)

I think the BBC version kept closer to the book, in terms of dialogue and such. There is a 'fleshing-out' of the characters that makes me understand their interactions better; like the reasons that Mr. and Mrs. Bennet married at all! Of course, it's been years since I read Jane Austen's book, so these are only impressions--and mine, alone. Someone else will likely have different opinions on the the two miniseries, if they choose to watch both. Personally, I find them both delightful in their own ways. If you like 'period romances' and classical literature, rent this version of P&P from the library, borrow it from a friend, or watch it on Netflix. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1392768000,,4172,4.795549374130737

It was obvious that the '95 version had a better budget as the costuming, locations, etc was much improved over this one. In this adaptation, the outfits Elizabeth wears look dowdy to me. Now, perhaps that was appropriate for the time, but I felt like it diminished her personality which was supposed to be lively and was a distraction for me as a viewer. The dancers seemed unsure of themselves and perhaps that is because that type of dancing probably was no longer well known and few knew how to perform it comfortably. They looked awkward. I suppose if one had never seen any other version it would be acceptable. For me, I'm sorry I listened to all of the positive reviews.

The characters were given the wrong dialogue, it was done out of sequence (Mrs. Bennett telling Mary to let the others have time to exhibit at Lucas lodge, Jane saying the Mr. Bingley seemed intelligent after seeing him riding his horse, Charlotte giving her opinion of marriage before they had met any of the principle characters). There were some moments at Netherfield that were very precise, but it seemed that they were rushing through the dialogue to get it said and seemed out of breath at the end of the speeches. The bickering amongst the family at Longbourne was terrible. I own the 1995 A&E DVD and will stick to that for my P&P fix.",1385769600,,962,4.320441988950276
299485,5,6300248569,"Simply the best P&P version bar none. It is the one closest to the book with the absolute best Bennett family, the best Mr. Collins and Charlotte, a perfect Jane and Lizzie and a pretty awesome Darcy.

I know that generally Darcy's portrayal in this version is seen as overly stiff, but if you read the book and you pay close attention to David Rintoul's performance you will begin to understand the subtle genius of his acting. Just as in the book and in keeping with the mores of the time period, his reactions are somewhat stilted, guarded, his interest in Lizzie covert, his outward manner indifferent. Very often Rintoul manages to convey his character's feelings through a simple twitch of his cheek or a slightly longer look but he is always proper in the 19th century British sense, always upright, never emotionally revealing.

Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Bennett are played to perfection with a strong dose of wit and irony. Jane and Lydia are also particularly well portrayed as is Ms. Bingley whose jealousy and pettiness and attempts at manipulating Darcy and her brother are clearly displayed.

Elizabeth Garvie's Lizzie is witty and playful, her demeanor in stark contrast to Darcy's haughty distant manner.

Mr. Collins is absolutely delightful, portrayed in humorous manner, yet clearly showing his passive aggresive behavior towards Lizzie in the second part of the book.

All in all you have to see this version if you are a true Austen fan. In my opinnion this version's main virtues reside in its subtlety and its fidelity to the original text, with wit and humour thrown in, just as intend by Austen's satirical portrayal of society at that time.

I have found this version significantly better than the 1995 one whose two redeeming features are: 1. Colin Firth and 2. the locations.  The 1995 version is overtly romantic, which is probably why it is more of a crowd pleaser than the more subdued 1980 one, but it is not as faithful to Austen's work.

I also really liked the 2005 version but although the characters were much better portrayed than in the 1995 version, the dialogue was modernized with elements that did not ring true to the original Austen text and the movie was made to be some kind of a Cinderella story with the Bennetts and the Darcys really far away on the social scale.

1. Elizabeth Garvie & David Rintoul (1980)
2. Keira Knightley & Matthew Mcfadyen (2005)

Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett are much more tolerable in the Knightley and MacFadyen version than this or the Collin Firth version, IMHO.

299487,5,6300248569,"This original BBC production is slower moving than  the A&E version but more in keeping with Miss Austen's book.  Elizabeth Garvey is more like the Elizabeth Bennet I imagined than Jennifer Ehle.  She had a vulnerability about her instead of the sneer Ehle portrayed.  While it was David Rintoul as Darcy that first captured my heart with his handsome looks, Colin Firth eventually won me over with his warmer interpretation.  Sorry, the dive into the lake was not the highlight for me.  BBC Jane was much prettier and conveyed more attachment to her sister. Casting of the other character was equally better than in the A&E version. I loved the extended conversation between Elizabeth & Aunt Gardiner and Elizabeth's concluding conversation with her father when he questioned her accepting Darcy's proposal. The best telling of the story can still be found in the book.",1383177600,2,870,5.006944444444445

299489,4,6300248569,"Good rendition, am collecting as many versions as I can for comparison to the book, this one was very good.",1383091200,,107,4.4
299490,5,6300248569,"Now that I've seen both this version and the 1995 A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I have to say that this BBC version has become my favorite. It wasn't in the beginning but by the end I was in love. The A&E version is probably a lot more relatable for people because it is pretty lively and zesty. The emotions are more apparent and you don't have to do a lot of picking apart of the scenes in the A&E version. That makes it more approachable than this BBC 1980's take on the story.

Subtle is the word that I would use to describe this miniseries and that's what eventually captured my heart. The reason that I LOVE BBC historicals is the subtlety. Two people look at each other and it's like a declaration of love. At the beginninig I felt as if the movie was a bit stiff but after the first hour I was enchanted. David Rintoul plays a very restrained and quiet version of Mr. Darcy. I felt like Rintoul's Mr. Darcy was way more enamored of Elizabeth than Colin Firth's version. He couldn't take his eyes off of her, tried to make conversation even though he was pretty awful at it and the proposal scene...it was endearing how horribly that went for Darcy. I really felt like Rintoul excellently played Mr. Darcy as a man who has no idea what to do with himself when he finds that he's in love.

Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth. Loved her. Absolutely loved her. She was a woman with a srong mind and opinion who gets a muddled up when she's so dead set on one idea that she misses the truth of what's going on and forgets that there are always two sides to a story. As much as I loved Elizabeth Gavie's performance and am quite aware that she gets the most screen time of anyone, it's Mr. Darcy who really stole the show in this one.

So, because of the fact that I feel this BBC version isn't as in-your-face as the A&E version, I love it in all of its glory. It didn't even feel dated to me and I like that it made me work a little to catch Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy falling in love.",1383004800,4,2000,4.203125

Though BBC's 1980 version is obviously low budget (less outdoor scapes, secondary characters missing), it still seems more true to the characters and feelings of Ms. Austen's masterpiece. Lizzy is witty, endearing, and analytical; Darcy is stoic but eventually shows his softer side. While I do like the A&E version, I found the characterizations more modern, more emotive, and more reactive. You pick up on the brewing passion between Lizzy & Darcy almost immediately; you miss out on the intellectual process that the Lizzy of the novels goes thru in discovering her admiration and love of Darcy. I probably have watched this 100 times and never get tired of hearing Ms. Austen's words come to life in this faithful adaptation.",1379548800,,848,5.0212765957446805

The worst, by far, is the Greer Garson version from 1946, in which the ladies dress like refugees from Tara (Gone With the Wind).  Either the film makers didn't know how people dressed in the early 1800's or they got a discount on left-overs from GWTW.  This version was almost as bad.  I could not tell which sister was which!  The four sisters couldn't be more different, yet in this version, they all acted alike.  Elizabeth didn't appear smarter or livelier than the others, and the little tart Lidia was indistinguishable from the others, not a saucy little flirt.  And Mr. Darcy, UGH!!

Rather than leaving things out that were in the book, this version seems to have added numerous conversations that never took place in the book, and I didn't feel they added to the story.  The casting was okay, I guess, although I didn't care for the actor who played Bingley, nor those portraying Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, all of them seeming less real somehow than in other versions.

She first saw it on PBS Masterpiece Theatre when it aired in 1981 and I ordered the VHS tape for Christmas one year. It's a good telling of the story, and covers almost all of the novel due to the length of the viewing - almost four hours. I personally prefer the 1996 BBC miniseries with Colin Firth which is also long, just over 4 hours, but I liked Colin's portrayal of Darcy immensely. The 2005 movie version is also good, and I like Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth, Matthew MacFadyen did a wonderful job as Darcy, I liked Donald Sutherland as the dad, and absolutely loved Judi Dench's take on Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

299590,4,6300248569,"One of the reasons Austen is still so compelling is that she depicts the tension between passion and order.  The ideal balance may have fallen more toward the order side in her time than it does today, but we still grapple with the same tension.

This version fails almost entirely to depict the passion, and therefore does not do justice to Austen.  It refers to passion, e,g, in Lydia and Wickham's elopement, but doesn't make us feel it-- Wickham is handsome but not really seductive.

I enjoyed it, but the Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth version is much better: more passion and closer to the book (who can improve on Austen's dialogue??).  For example, the screenplay of the version under review  leaves out the gorgeous lines Darcy says at the end about how he's been a selfish being all his life...and so would he still be but for her, ""dearest, loveliest Elizabeth"". This reveals the real reason he loves her (or at least one of the most important) and shows his essential goodness and integrity.",1369440000,,999,4.745664739884393
299591,4,6300248569,"Perhaps I prefer my Jane Austen Hollywooded Up a bit but I just loved the newer Keira Knightly version.  The best Mr. Darcy on record. He brought real passion to the role with just a glance.  Now, to this movie, the BBC mini series, I have no idea when I bought it but a few days ago I saw it there on the shelf so I started looking at it.  Both the women leads are extremely good and very attractive. I did have a little trouble at first determining which was Lizzie and which was Jane as they look very much alike.  If you look at the Colin Firth version, neither of the lead women are very attractive and Jane is actually plain with a huge neck. In this version, David Rintoul as Darcy is definitely a one note actor and you actually don't feel any of his supposed passion for Elizabeth. He is the most wooden actor I've ever seen in any role.  Nor does the actor in the role of Bingley seem all that much enthralled with Jane. I do wish there was some way to let the audience know what a really silly and stupid woman Mrs. Bennet is without having her in so many scenes. In every version I've ever seen I just want to slap her silly and often fast forward through many of her scenes. The most odious performance of this role is in the Colin Firth version. They reeeeely overdid it on that one.  The reading of the Mrs. Bennet role in this BBC mini series is made more annoying by the fact that they stick her in almost every scene during the first part of the movie and one always wonders why her husband hasn't killed her years ago. The most sympathetic reading of the role is in the Keira Knightly version but she still grates on the nerves. As in many BBC movies, this version tends to drag a bit and include many scenes that could have been omitted without hurting the production at all. I like this BBC version better than the Colin Firth version but, as I said, the far superior film is the Keira Knightly movie. She really captures Lizzie and though they have taken some liberties with the story it just makes it better.  To be honest, I find Jane Austen's books to be wordy to the point of boring and everybody just talks, talks, talks to the point where one wants to just scream ""for the love of pete, get on with it"".

299631,4,6300248569,"I've taken some time to read many of the reviews here.  I think it helpful to know something of the qualifications/limitations of a reviewer.  I'm a middle age, married man.  I like to read.  I like many types of books and movies.  I've been enjoying reading Jane Austen's novels these past few months, then researching the internet for favorite film versions of the stories.  I've only Northanger Abbey to finish now and I'll have read all six novels.  I've also purchased several dvd adaptations.  I'm not a scholar of Austen, and I certainly don't have profound insight.  But I think I read with fairly efficient comprehension. Reading her prose and syntax is very entertaining, but I believe it would be easy for careless readers to miss the subtlety if they don't pay attention.  I was constantly pulling out a dictionary, or re-reading entire sections.  And since I'm not from the England of 1800, the visualization of film makers is helpful to me to more clearly imagine the settings of the novels.

Like many who have posted an opinion here, I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice.  I actually read it twice in a row a few months ago.  I'd seen the Greer Garson film adaptation a few times on Turner Classic Movies, and I very much enjoyed the BBC Jennifer Ehle version when I recently watched it after reading the book.  I purchased the BlueRay dvd.  I recommend it.  I agree that it is easy and fun to watch it repeatedly.  I've also seen the much later film starring Kiera Knightly, and I like it also.

The older BBC Elizabeth Garvie version is available on Netflix, and I also found a dvd copy locally at a bookstore.  The picture and sound quality suffers in comparison to products of today's technology.  But the product isn't very expensive, and the viewing experience is pleasurable.  Many of these reviews for this serial version compare it to the later produced Jennifer Ehle serial.  For me, there's an unfairness about that since the principals involved with the Garvie version didn't have the advantage of seeing the later product.  So I watch this older series with a respect for its originality.  I like the adaptation very much, I like Ms. Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet and she matches closely what my mind's eye pictured her.  (I still remember when I was a younger man.  Ms. Garvie was a lovely young woman.)  I like the stage play quality which I take as intended.  That does give it a less ""film perfect"" aspect, but it doesn't bother me since I read the book more as a play than a reality.  There are many scenes in the book that would have been lit only by candle light.  This adaptation attempts to reproduce that effect, there are shadows across the faces sometimes.  Any criticism of lighting or production values is lost on me.

My opinion is that the only relevant comparisons should be made to the original source material....the book.  Some characters/actors in this film are closer to what my reader's imagination envisioned than their counterparts in the later films.  Other characters are better represented in the later films.  As the saying goes, ""there's no accounting for taste in art"".  The five sisters in this version are attractive and look enough alike to believe they're related.  I like the portrayal of Mary particularly.  She isn't unattractive and she's more complex than assumed.  While pretending to be anti-social, she actually very much wants to participate and succeed socially.  I still haven't seen a Mr. Collins that reflects what I read.  In the book he is very young, like his cousins.  His youth is what gives his behavior as a suck-up to Lady de Bourgh much of the humor of his character.  He tries very hard to act older, and more important than he is, which Mr. Bennet especially enjoys.  The film actor for Mr. Collins seemed too old for my idea.  The actor who plays Kitty is attractive, but seems a little too old as well.  Jane Bennet was attractive, as required in the book plot.  I could agree with Mr. Darcy that she was the handsome woman at the assembly.  Mr. Bennet was correctly portrayed as something of a disappointment as a father to his daughters, and his marriage an example of the type of disappointment that Elizabeth and Jane wanted to avoid in their own lives.  Mrs. Bennet was written by Austen with a great deal of irony.  If you know that, you can find it in this film as well.

There's a momentary scene where Miss Anne de Bourgh attempts to reach/connect with Elizabeth when they say their good-byes.  It's telling that she's a captive to her domineering mother, and would love to express herself as freely as Elizabeth is able.  I'm anxious to re-read the book to look for that theme.  If it isn't in the book, I still thought it added something of value to the play.  Like many of the others who have recorded their opinions here, I could go on with more.

For me, two very important moments in the book are, one, when Elizabeth reads Darcy's letter and realizes how wrong she had been in her judgements of Darcy and Wickham.  How ""...I, who have valued myself on my abilities...Till this moment I never knew myself"".  This is included in the screen play.

The second event I looked for, and I think my most noticeable impression was the lack of this scene, is where Elizabeth confesses that her feelings for Darcy began to change when she finally saw Pemberley.  The book scene is between Jane and Elizabeth after both their engagements are established and Jane is catching up on events unknown to her.  Superficially it seems unbecoming of Elizabeth to attach value to the wealth of Darcy's estate, etc.  But I read it as a watershed moment when Elizabeth began to understand the significance of what Mr. Darcy was offering her.  It wasn't just romance on the table.  Not only was she becoming aware that Darcy was an admirable man, but also he was offering her an inclusion in a generational continuity of benevolence that he'd inherited; and that he had to, and wanted to, respect.  This would be something she could justifiably be ""proud"" of.  I thought these were important elements in the book and I think Jane Austen thought so also.  Although there is a film scene where Elizabeth reflects on the many responsibilities that Darcy shoulders as the principal resident of his community, this last impact on Elizabeth (or at least the dialog from the book I was expecting) wasn't included in the film.

Then again, what do I know?  It's strangely fun to read the book and get lost in it...even for an old man.  I need to re-read the book now that I've seen these several films.  I think there's a tendency to half remember dialog from the book, hear it again in a film, and then say the film was faithful to the book when it really wasn't the case.

At any rate, I wanted to add my approval of this film to the data base here.  I understand a little of the passion of readers of Jane Austen, and their possessiveness of the story of Pride and Prejudice.  I assume that many fans are relatively young people.  I think many over-react to the film versions, but I admire their affection for the source material.  I don't have many problems with books adapted to film.  I finish by repeating my opinion that the comprehension that readers possess as a habit or skill (or their lack of it) is evident in reading some of their criticism archived here.  And comparing the BBC Jennifer Ehle adaptation (which is great but isn't always faithful the the book) to this older stage play film doesn't seem sensible to me.",1363996800,2,7505,4.6436170212765955

299718,3,6300248569,"The 1940 ""Pride and Prejudice"" (hereinafter P&P) starring Laurence Olivier is really awful. They are wearing clothing from decades later (hoop skirts like in ""Gone With the Wind"" and made ridiculous changes to the story (Lady Catherine is in cahoots with Darcy and thinks Elizabeth is good for him). They made Mr. Collins a librarian instead of a clergyman. Even Olivier said that Greer Garson was wrong for the role of Elizabeth. Characters are missing (the Gardiners, Maria Lucas, Georgiana Darcy!) and there is a slapstick element in some parts that seems wildly inappropriate (Mr. Collins running after Elizabeth), Lady Catherine sitting on a music box, the Bennets letting Lady Catherine in and making her step over broken china that is on the floor). Major plot elements are either removed or altered to such an extent that it is not worth watching.

The 1980 v. the 1995 versions:
I disagree with the reviewer who called the 1980 version more authentic than the 1995 version. In the 1980 version Lizzy laments that Mr. Darcy would not send her a letter but in those days a man could not send a letter to an unmarried female. That is why he had to personally hand her the letter he gave her after his first proposal. Also the clothes are not as authentic as the ones in the 1995 version. They changed certain lines for no apparent reason. They have Mrs. Bennet showing Lady Catherine in--that would not have happened. They had servants to do that. Mr. Darcy is so stiff in the 1980 version that you can almost feel that he was directed to be proud and ram rod straight. He is too wooden. Colin Firth's Darcy's woodenness has a humanity behind it. You don't think about the acting while watching him. The 1995 version is much more fast-paced and engaging--just like the novel. I did like the actor who played Mr. Collins in the 1980 version better than the one in the 1995 version. He is more like what is described in the book. Mr. Bennet is pretty good in the 1980 version but overall the 1995 one is vastly superior. It draws you in and you feel like the characters from the book have come alive.",1358294400,2,2104,4.610666666666667

As for Mr. Darcy, well a wooden puppet would have done just as well.  There was no feeling or emotion, and forget about chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  The way they portrayed their characters made impossible to believe that they would ever be attracted to each other.

I double-checked the running times: 265 minutes vs. 226 minutes! Nothing earth-shattering added; just a few more scenes with Mrs. Bennett and poor Kitty. But more is always better when it's Jane Austen.
I saw this in 1984 on PBS. I knew NOTHING about the story or characters (i blame my high school English teachers for not making me read this!) and LOVED it from the start.
The ""hate turns into love"" story has always been one of my favorites.
What is best about this version:
-Mr. & Mrs. Bennett are true to the book. Other versions soften them up but he is sarcastic & selfish in the book and she is flighty, shallow & scatterbrained.
-Lizzie and Jane are wonderful with appropriate portions of beauty (Jane is prettier & Lizzie is intelligent & pretty & sassy).
-The Bingleys are wonderful; Mr. Bingley is NOT an idiot (as he was in the movie) and Caroline is a sly & formidable adversary.
-Lady Catherine is HILARIOUS as is Mr. Collins (although not people you'd want to spend any time with).
-There is a LOT of Jane Austen's dialogue AND Lizzie's internal monologues where she notes the shortcomings of her parents.
-You get to see the process of how Lizzie & Darcy come to appreciate each other. It involved a lot of time together...long walks and dinners at Rosings. They didn't just fall in love overnight.

What is lacking:
-a swoon-inducing Mr. Darcy. David Rintoul is adequate, fairly handsome & snooty but cannot compare to Matthew M.

SOMEDAY WHEN I HAVE TO TIME TO LEARN HOW TO EDIT:
i would like to weave together all the best bits from the 3 versions to make one PERFECT version!

It is far truer to the book and the period than the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle series: Fay Weldon's script is almost unadulterated Austen, with very few alterations (apart from necessary cuts of course) or additions. Elizabeth Garvey is, for me, the quintessential Lizzie, with a fine voice and bearing, a delightfully satirical eye, and an ability to convey deep feeling with little more than the raising of an eyebrow or a tightening of the lips. David Rintoul makes Lizzie's detestation of Darcey early on perfectly understandable, and then allows the character to warm and to win not only Lizzie but the audience as well. The sisters are all excellent, and Mr and Mrs Bennett (Moray Watson and Priscilla Morgan) are superb. Judy Parfitt as Lady Catherine is peerless, and in fact there is no cause for any objection from even the most resolute Austenian.

This film is a very nicely done version, but it is difficult to truly dissect and rate this particular version after seeing the Andrew Davies version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Colin Firth portrayed on-screen the quintessential Darcy that Jane Austen had in mind, in my opinion.  He managed to play a gentlemen of few words, with a stern countenance, who was drop-dead gorgeous and filthy rich.  His Darcy cannot be compared to any other, which makes it difficult to really enjoy any other film versions of Pride and Prejudice.

This is the mosy faithful video or movie adaptation of a book that I know, and the best show I have ever seen on TV.  The casting and performances are superb; just Mr. Collins alone is worth the price.  I could go on and on, but what more can I say?",1345593600,3,472,3.8958333333333335
299776,3,6300248569,"I think that even if I hadn't seen and loved the more recent BBC version, I would have found this one somewhat lacking. Of course, the comparison doesn't help. The Ehle & Firth version has the advantage of being longer, fresher, and better cast. The energy in that one works; in this one it doesn't. It is, however, still preferable to the Keira Knightly version which was too modern, didn't grasp the difference between wit and immaturity and was so wrong on so many levels. I don't mean to say that this is absolutely terrible, it's just off. It seems to be either a problem in character interpretation or directing, maybe both.

Elizabeth Garvie is so calm, vague, and restrained that she appears almost medicated. While she's still intelligent, there is very little evidence of wit or charm. She just drifts from scene to scene as a pale and almost emotionless abstraction of the real Elizabeth while saying all the right things.

Darcy is supposed to be stiff, solemn, and not show emotion and, in that sense, David Rintoul got it right (particularly the 'stiff' part). Unfortunately, the vulnerability and shyness that lie beneath the public mask is never hinted at, there is very little difference between the Mr. Darcy at the beginning and at the end, and you never detect any spark or attraction or sensual tension between the two leads, even in the last scene where they are walking side by side. He resembled a man parodying fashion models in tight clothes walking down the runway.

The main characters are not the only ones that suffer from either misinterpretation or misdirecting. Mr. Bennet is portrayed as more irresponsible and spoiled than in other versions rendering him much less likeable; the warmth between him and Lizzy is not portrayed successfully; and both Kitty and Georgiana appear to be a bit older than in the original. Even Pemberley is a bit of a disappointment.

On the plus side, Mrs. Bennet is as flighty as ever but is portrayed a little more sympathetically. Jane, Lydia, Wickam, and the Bingley clan are very close to the original; Mary is as pedantic as usual but with a sweet smile; the costumes are attractive, and the photography is good when it isn't being even better.",1345075200,4,2212,4.797900262467191

299791,4,6300248569,"I found this version of P and P very enjoyable and very faithful to the novel.  Elizabeth Garvie is my favorite Elizabeth Bennet.  She has just the right amount of wit and humor, very much how I pictured the Lizzy from the novel.  Her delivery is wonderful.  Darcy is portrayed much more stiff and unemotional in this version than in other versions.  While I really enjoyed Colin Firth in the role, this Darcy is, at least for me, a little more like the Darcy of the novel.  He is hard to read, and his arrogance, pride, and stiff manners make him very unlikable.  The proposal is done with a cool certainty that any woman he proposes to must say yes, because he is, after all, Mr. Darcy.  Colin Firth brought more emotion into the role, and we see him like Lizzy much sooner in the 1995 version.  The proposal is done with much more emotion in that one as well.  Really I enjoy both for different reasons.  A combination of the two would be perfect I think, but as it is, I do think this Darcy was more my picture of him from the novel.

The rest of the cast was well done.  I really like the tenderness of Jane, and Mr. Collins is very funny, though older than a man of 25.  The few liberties they took were rather odd, especially the ones with Mr. Collins.  Lizzy does do voice overs, and while not ideal for a movie, they didn't bother me.  It is difficult to portray the inner thoughts of characters sometimes when taken from a book, so I thought this was ok.  The set and costumes, etc., do feel a bit like a stage production at times.  That is one of the big differences from this version and the 1995 version.  The 1995 versions was beautiful in every way.  This one wasn't as pretty.

Overall, If you love P and P, give this version a try.  One of my favorite parts was how Lizzy met Darcy at Pemberley.  I won't give it away, but I thought it was very well done.",1340928000,,1872,4.2259887005649714
299792,4,6300248569,"Let us be clear. This was definitely from the 80s. It involves the most volumized & violently teased reinterpretation of Georgian curls ever seen in a period film, and liberally.

That said, if you've seen and loved the 1995 BBC enough times, you'll get a kick out of recognizing those crucial quirks of manner and characterization--sometimes the expressions are even exactly the same--it seems like every one of the BBC actors borrowed VERY liberally from this version! And the characters, if you can force yourself to be sufficiently open-minded about it all, really do very well. The 1995 BBC also borrows liberally from the tone, pace, and staging of this movie, and I think it deserves at least a little credit for setting such foundations.

Some things will probably irk or confuse you: Kitty and Lydia are indistinguishable; Caroline and Louisa have had their colorings and personalities swapped (if, like me, you find the BBC 1995 to be the true canon), Jane is a brunette who looks like a blend of Rosamund Pike and Jennifer Ehle (confusing!!) with Liv Tyler; Lizzie is lighter (like I said, confusing) and looks like a hot 80s American coed, not a classic British country-style beauty. The film also seems to have decided that the way to demonstrate her ""fine eyes"" is to give her (and nobody else) hilariously racoonny 80s-style grey eyeliner. ANd I agree with those who have no idea what Mary's doing. What are you doing, Mary? Why do you have Lizzie's lines?

Despite all that, the characterizations really grow on you! Hard to drive Colin Firth out of my head for long enough, but I think in all fairness this may be really the finest and truest Darcy on film. And Lizzie grows on you a lot. Takes a while to get used to the hyperenunciation and stilted style of the delivery, but it settles down, and our leading couple's chemistry is fantastic.",1338854400,2,1860,4.770186335403727

There are reviewers here who actually think this better follows the book? Really? Sure, there is a lot of Austen's dialogue, but it is kind of awkwardly recited rather than acted well, and some of the characterizations are way off. Mr. Bennet comes off as a real jerk...barking at everyone and openly sneering at his wife, Mary gets far more attention in the script than she should....and what is up with her getting some of Elizabeth's lines and gossiping about Wickham and finally, making eyes at Bingley? Did I miss something in the source material? Kitty trying to flirt with Bingley and crying all the time and coughing so much....taking an amusing joke from the book and bludgeoning it until I assumed she had asthma or consumption. And I know looks are subjective but Jane Bennet looked distractingly like Lily Tomlin. There is no way on earth I could buy her as a beauty. Mr. Darcy was handsome but possessed none of Firth's ability to let us see what is happening behind his eyes. He recited his lines and looked so cold most of the time he uncomfortably started to seem like a Regency era psychopath. When he approached Elizabeth from behind and asked her to dance a reel, I thought he was going to sink a knife between her shoulderblades. Handsome but creepy. The production values are really poor, it looks cheaply done and the transitions are awful. There is little to no imagination in the script....resorting to Lizzie inner monologues in case the audience doesn't get it? It was awkward and weird, especially for someone who knows the book so well. I love how the 1995 version added some key scenes from Darcy's perspective....not in the book, but it helps us understand him and root for them more....this is a movie adaptation, not a book recital. Faithfulness is good, but there should be some imagination as well. Anyway, at least this is better than the dreadful 1940s version and the 2005 disaster. But the 1995 one is the definitive version. See this one if you want to have fun comparing, but don't expect too much. I was even getting bored and I can sit through the 1995 version over and over, and have read the book every year.",1337904000,15,2291,4.701492537313433

When watching this, I cannot help but think it seems ""staged"" next to the naturalistic transitions in the Simon Langton version. That is exactly what was remarkable about the 1995 version...the pacing of the  pauses between the exchanges, which might in other conversations seem overlong, but here are perfect. The  non verbal responses that surround the dialogue give life to the words in a manner that is exactly what I imagine when I read the book.

This adaptation has too many characters speaking with the social insights that Austen herself voiced as the ""narrator"". Thus, while the lines are faithful to the book, the teleplay does a disservice to the integrity of the personalities that Austen crafted so consistently in the book.

This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.

Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr. Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.

As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet, Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.

As fans know, the story begins with the arrival of the young, wealthy and single Mr. Bingley and his friends to take possession of the estate of Netherfield Park.  Their near-neighbors the Bennets, with five unmarried daughters, are anxious to meet Mr. Bingley and his friend Mr. Darcy at a country dance.  Misadventure at the dance lays the groundwork for a complicated relationship between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy.

The length of the mini-series allows for inclusion of most of the dialogue from the novel, especially the interactions among the Bennets.  The series is perhaps a little challenged in delivering Lizzie's internal dialogue, while the stiff and silent Mr. Darcy doesn't get much chance to earn the sympathy of the audience until late in the production.  Inevitably, this production gets compared with the 1995 Grenada TV version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, and with the 2005 movie version starring Kiera Knightley and Matthew McFaydon.

The angsty inner monologues of Elizabeth Bennet are not only off-script, they add a tone to her character of maudlin romanticism and self-absorption that is not the Eliza Bennet I know and love.

The one brilliant portrayal here, imo, is David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy who gave me a new way to look at the character -- very convincingly in step with the sense of privilege someone of his stature would have and still sympathetic. The goofy music played every time Mr. Collins showed up is a good example of how this version takes the really wonderful subtle and clever writing of Jane Austin to an almost slapstick level at times.

Sabina Franklyn's wooden performance as Elizabeth didn't help but Priscilla Morgan's shrill excessive and intense interpretation of Mrs. Bennet was brilliant.

There is so much comedy here to entertain, especially during the hilarious proposal scene, where Elizabeth tries her best to hide her revulsion and maintain her composure. The part where Mrs. Bennet insists on Mr. Bennet talking some sense into Elizabeth (into accepting Mr. Collins' proposal) and his reaction is worth a good laugh.

What lets down this older adaptation though is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatization. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.

On the whole, I find it hard to fault this adaptation. It will always remain one of my favorite adaptations, not just of Pride and Prejudice, but of Austen's works as it is very faithful and well-cast. I recommend this to all Austen fans and also those who have only watched the 1995 adaptation and the 2005 movie version starring Keira Knightley.",1324166400,,3442,4.9156626506024095

By far this is en pointe with the book.  The costuming, the scenes, the speed in which (or should I say, the non-speed the characters were portrayed was like one long Sunday afternoon sitting in the fields reading the book.  The whole story line just walked out of the books and came alive.  I believe D. Rintoul is my ideal Darcy - stately, handsome, aloof and very deep in thoughts. Each actor brought their character to life as close to Jane Austen's imagination as possible.

The three more recent versions all have superior characterizations in one or more aspects, in my judgment.  There is no version, unless I have carelessly overlooked something, which portrays Lydia as the ""tallest"" of the five Bennet sisters,  which Jane Austen's character asserts in the book.

I do not think the longest version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth will ever be equalled for its sheer beauty of filming, depth of character development,  and, for me at least, the very moving scene of Elizabeth's visit to Pemberley.  I do prefer the choice made by this version for Jane.  The story repeatedly refers to Jane as being the most beautiful of the Bennet girls, but is not accurate in my preferred version.  This version has it better.  Although the treatment of George Wickham is quite well done here, the lack of time available does not allow it to match up to my preferred version.  The same is true of Mr. Collins.

There is so much which could be said about this immensely popular story.  I will surely return again to watch this version from time to time, though it is not the best.",1316476800,4,1237,4.593607305936073
299868,4,6300248569,"There are 4 film version of Pride and Prejudice, each with something to recommend them. This 4 hour version was done by the BBC around 1979, and it looks it. The color is washed out. I wish they would restore it, for there are some excellences not reached in the other versions, to be found here. I believe the best Jane is here. She is at least equal to Lizzy in beauty, and warm and expessive. The acting by all is well done, as is true for all acting in all versions except Wickham in the Keira Knightly P&P. I'm afraid the costumers did Lizzy no favors in this film (see cover).  She often looks like an atrractive woman in the wrong clothes, today I am specially thinking of her blue travelling clothes when she goes to Pemberley.  These are my favorite Gardiners, too, especially Mrs. Gardiner, although Mr. Gardiner in the Knightly version is also strong.  Pemberly scenes, which are always my favorites, were done well. Our Pemberly here is not as imposing as in later versions, but suitable, and the visitors actually get to go on their walk in this version.  I was a bit surprised to find Lizzy at the inn in Lambton grasping her letters from Jane about Lydia's elopement, and then running from Lambton to Pemberley, altho Darcy brags of doing the run as a youth in the Knightly version. It's a long way. I prefer the wonderful scene in the Keira Knightly version, which is otherwise not as good at displaying Pemberly or the action there. (Unspoiler alert, I'm not going to describe it but it is wonderful.)

I hadn't thought of it before, but this movie has voice overs of Elizabeth's thoughts. The novel often describes her thoughts, sometimes dramatizing them but frequently not, and this has always been a problem for people staging or making a film of the novel. Voice overs are not very dramatic. The letters run a close second in dramatic problems for the same reason, yet they deliver key information and must be included. Here they are generally given as voice overs, and shortened. In the Knightly version they are often dramatized, behind the voice overs, which works better as the dramatizations are the images the letters would create in the readers mind, we hope.

Reasonably faithful to the book - especially in including some of the later scenes which are often skipped. The film, like all others, really does not go beyond the wedding (really, not to it). I'd love to see life at Pemberly with Lizzy and Mrs Gardiner going round the park in their low phaeton with a couple of ponies. But, it is not to be.

One technical quibble other than the color: the film comes on an unlabeled 2-sided DVD. Difficult to know which side you are going to see when you get it in the player. They really should have gone the extra 30 cents for a second DVD.

This is not my first choice for a P&P film (Keira Knightly's is, today). It is my 3rd, but it is a pleasure to watch and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1315094400,,2929,4.5236294896030245
299869,5,6300248569,"This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is the 1980 BBC miniseries,adapted by British novelist Fay Weldon and is a very faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. It consists of five episodes and stars the engaging Elizabeth Garvie as Ms Elizabeth Bennet and the aristocratic-looking and handsome David Rintoul as Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.

This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.

Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr. Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.

As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet, Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.

What lets down this older adaptation is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatization. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.

The characters are endearing, except for Mr. Darcy.  He is stanch, cold, and proud--exactly as he should be.  Then he becomes a very endearing character as you see him change b/c of Elizabeth.

299872,5,6300248569,"Published in 1813, Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE received good reviews, proved popular with readers, and both author and novel have grown in stature with each passing year.  In the modern world, that stature has translated into performance adaptations, and there have been at least four stage versions and at least ten screen versions.  Interestingly, each version seems to have been extremely popular in its own day.  The Greer Garson version, for example, was widely admired in 1940; today, however, it is regarded as unduly glossy and distinctly miscast.  Most recently, the Keira Knightley version was liked in 2005; today it is considered secondary to other versions.  The major problem in adapting PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it would seem, is the sheer complexity of the story, which does not fit well within a two-hour run time, and in consequence there have been two mini-series, the Elizabeth Garvey version of 1980 and the Jennifer Ehle version of 1995. Produced by BBC, the Garvey version contained five episodes; produced by BBC and A&E, the Ehle version contained six episodes.

Like all Jane Austen works, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is essentially a comedy of manners, a satrical and ironic look at the way people must negotiate a complex set of courtesies and social restrictions to reach an ultimate goal.  The general story is very well known.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are country gentry with five daughters.  Since the estate is entailed, it is important that the daughters marry--and marry as well as possible.  When wealthy Mr. Bingley takes a nearby estate, he brings with him the proud Mr. Darcy.  Mr. Bingley is much admired by all and oldest daughter Jane falls in love with him.  Mr. Darcy, however, is widely disliked; he wounds second-oldest daughter Elizabeth's feelings, and she is further prejudiced against him when the newly-arrived Mr. Wickham tells several unsavory stories of Mr. Darcy.  But while Darcy interrupts Mr. Bingley's romance with Jane, it soon transpires that Wickham is a rake, and he elopes with Lydia, the youngest Bennett daughter.  This precipitates a social scandal that only Mr. Darcy can resolve, which he does in a manner most satisfying to all concerned.

The 1980 mini-series is very much of the BBC of its era, which is to say that it is clearly done with an eye to economy.  Outside shots are few; interiors are clearly sets; costumes are correct for period but clearly pulled from pre-existing stock.  And indeed, the overall effect is that of a stage play with wordy dialogue.  But it also happens that the mini-series is extraordinarily, perhaps even flawlessly cast.  Elizabeth Garvey is the perfect Elizabeth Bennett, smart, sharp, and direct; David Rintoul equals her as the proud Mr. Darcy, and indeed every single supporting player is equally fine.  The dialogue is extracted from the novel without a great deal of fiddling, and screenwriter Fay Weldon does not make the mistake of ""adjusting"" Austen's words: this is indeed how the novel sounds when read, and while the lines are often complex, the actors render them meticulously.  Director Cyril Coke, also known for such BBC series as UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS; THE ONEDEN LINE; and THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET, sets the tempo and moves the actors with tremendous flair, grace, and charm.

The 1995 Jennifer Ehle version has many fans, but I have always found it wildly miscast; neither Ehle nor Colin Firth seem of the period (indeed Firth seems more of a bootblack than a great gentleman), and Julia Sawalha's Lydia is nothing short of disastrous.  Yes, it is stagey, there is no denying that, but for me the 1980 mini-series is a truly fine adaptation, and when I return to the novel it is Elizabeth Garvey as Elizabeth Bennett I see before me.  Strongly, strongly recommended.

But after watching it a couple of times, because it had more dialogue between Darcy and Elizabeth, I became addicted to it.  I had to buy the DVD, which is of much better quality than Netflix's.  I must have watched it twenty times already!  I really like Colin Firth's version, but I must say I like this one a little better.  It is much better cast and this Elizabeth is more of what you picture her to be after reading the book.  I love every single scene Elizabeth and Darcy appear together.  David Rintoul is intriguing.

It does change a few things from the book (all adaptations do) but I feel it remained true to the spirit throughout. It's much more under-stated and ""low-key"" than the other adaptations- no real sexed up scenes or over the top caricatures. It's biggest strength, IMO, is its cast, who are almost all close to the book characters' ages and descriptions. The biggest negative is the low production values of the time, which is just something one has to get used to.

This version, even though it changes some things around and adds and cuts a few scenes, keeps others that no other adaptation has (unless it's one of those older ones that are not available to the public!). I especially like the scene after the second proposal where Darcy and Elizabeth discuss their attraction to each other and when it began. That's one of my favorite scenes in the book and it always disappoints me that the others don't include it!

As with all the older adaptations, if dated, stagey production values turn you off, you probably won't like this version. But if you can look past that, I think you will really like it like I do!",1304294400,3,1218,4.506787330316742

I wish he would loosen up sooner in the miniseries, but still, physically he makes a perfect Darcy, and again, this adaptation follows the book quite well.

It does have the ""budget TV"" look to it (not unusual for a show made in that time frame) but the costumes don't look dated--they look fairly historically accurate. The actress who plays Lady Catherine DeBurgh (I hope I spelled that right) is fantastic. Old enough to be Darcy's aunt and young enough to be *really* scary.

I like to savor and enjoy all my favorite adaptations of Pride and Prejudice for different reasons. I don't find that it's an ""either or"" sort of thing. I love the 1980 Garvie version for its faithfulness to the novel, the witty dialog, and for both Garvie *and* Rintoul.

299891,2,6300248569,"For a dedicated Austinphile who can't bear not to own every version they can get their hands on, not much will stop them from ordering this version of Pride and Prejudice.  After all, bad reviews certainly didn't stop me.  My intent is to add my voice to the clamor so that not quite so dedicated collectors won't mistake this for anything approaching a quality adaptation.

The costuming, locations, and pacing of the film are actually quite good.  I wish all Austin books would be adapted to film at well over the two hour mark.  I love the much slower pace of life in that time, and you don't at all feel the need to go rushing about from one crisis to the next.

What is woefully missing is any interest whatsoever in the characters themselves.  Jane's goodness fails to shine in any sort of tangible way.  Mary's priggishness was badly scripted enough to actually have her sound quite sensible on several subjects.  Kitty is mere wallpaper, and Lydia registers, but somehow leaves no impression, which isn't good for a character meant to inspire a major family crisis.  Mr. Bennet is completely disconnected from his family, and the gentle and exasperated affection his book self feels for his family is portrayed in a manner that feels critical; you have no sense he even likes his daughters.

And Lizzie - oh my word.  What makes Lizzie so engaging in print and most other screen versions is her sense of the absurd and her ability to share that twinkle in her eye.  This Lizzie is annoying and whiny.  When Mr. Darcy is overheard calling her ""tolerable"", she immediately gathers her skirts and runs across the room to tattle in her mother's ear.  She engages in mean spirited gossip for no apparent reason, and for the life of me I cannot find any singular trait in this version that would spark a proud and shy Darcy to be captivated despite himself.  Austin's Lizzie adores laughter, and has a complete sense of the world run mad.  This Lizzie is humorless, dull, and rather dislikable.

299895,5,6300248569,"There have been several good adaptions of Pride and Prejudice. The most popular are, I expect, the very lavish BBC production starring Colin Firth and the recent Hollywood film version starring Keira Knightley.  A real Jane Austen fan will likely want to see them all. But for a lover of the book none IMO equals this not so lavish earlier BBC version.

What makes it so exceptional? Several things.

The first is the character of of Lizzy.  She's the girl you knew and loved in the book. Smart. Sassy. Opinionated. But most of all endearing.  Indeed every character you came to love in the book comes to life in the production as if they simply became flesh and blood and walked off the printed page,

The second thing that makes this adaptation ""best"" for the Austen fan is that it has not been modernized. And why should it be? Jane Austen's greatest gift was her ability to see past custom into the common heart of mankind. That is why her books resonate with readers as much in the 21st century as they did in her own.

Yes the sets and lighting are flat and the camerawork only of TV quality, but the script, character development and acting is so wonderful that this viewer at least didn't care a whit.

Propriety is one thing, but some of Austen's characters are intentionally over the the top, and so I think it's fitting that in other versions the characters express that energy and sense of humor. Here they are just dry, and while the script doesn't eliminate all of the humor, it's delivered so poorly as to fall completely flat.",1277164800,6,478,4.443181818181818

There just isn't the ""feeling"" we get with the Ehle or the Knightly version.  I give it 3 stars because it was watchable and I did enjoy it.  Just not as much as the other two newer versions.",1276041600,2,523,4.17
299908,4,6300248569,"I've always liked Elizabeth in this version A LOT. She's bright, attractive and appealing. Job well done by Elizabeth Garvie. As for the family, this version's Jane is quite pretty which is important to the story. The 1995 Jane was not attractive enough to be the family beauty. I enjoyed plain Mary with her attempts to get attention and Mrs. Bennet with her nerves was just right. The emphasis in 1980 is internal with little outdoor scenery and activity like the later version, but it's more in tune with Austen's book. Most of the action is indoors and sedate, not out in the countryside. I also thought pompous Mr. Collins with his gawky moves and snide Caroline Bingley were excellent.
My one quibble with this version is the stiff, rather boring portrayal of Mr. Darcy. And that's a failing since he is supposed to become Elizabeth's perfect match. It's hard to understand how Elizabeth could be attracted to him at all other than he ""saved"" her sister.

We already own two other versions of the movie, the one starring Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfayden, as well as the A&E version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. When I found this BBC version I had to buy it, hoping I would like it as well.  Unfortunately I found it very disappointing.  The acting is inferior to the other two and it doesn't follow the book as well in either dialog or story line.  ( I have also read the book several times). The Mr Bennet character was much too stern, Mr Darcy way too cold and stiff, and the Bennet girls were so much the same it was hard to tell them apart.  We watched the film once and decided it wasn't worth a second look.  The  A&E version is by far the best of the three.  It is superbly acted and follows the dialog and story line of the book very well.  The newer version is very good as well but is too short to allow the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth to evolve.

First saw this version, produced by the BBC, on Masterpiece Theater in 1980. The more recent and forgettable A&E version, Colin Firth not withstanding, dumbed down Jane Austen's language unforgivably and featured actresses so buffed, they practically burst out of their Empire organdy frocks. The old MGM film with Greer Garson was appalling. Setting of the Keira Knightley film might have been more accurate, but that overall production doesn't compare with the BBC's.
Fay Weldon, noted British author, dramatized the novel in five parts. Weldon was so skillful she could distill the essence of Jane Austen's wry observations without diminishing them. The rhythm and speech patterns of the novel have been translated beautifully to the screen.  It's as if Jane had a really good editor.
Acting is topnotch. Judy Parfit's Lady Katharine even better than Judi Dench's! Mr. Collins, Darcy, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Bennett, all are perfection. Elizabeth, the sisters, dastardly Wickham, Bennett aunt/uncle most excellent.",1252281600,4,1149,5.278688524590164

Priscilla Morgan as Mrs. Bennett is wonderful. And appealing! You can see how Mr. Bennett might have fallen for her. Mr. Bennett is rather too austere for me, though.

And Malcolm Rennie as Mr. Collins! I love him! He's exactly what the book says he should be -- large, conceited, pompous -- without making you cringe at being near him. Some Mr. Collinses make you want to wash your hands after watching.

This is a gentler, less boisterous production than the Ehle/Firth one. I'd say Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine (Judy Parfitt) are much better in this one. My husband and I watch both, often, and I think we have almost a skull video going with a combination of actors.",1243900800,,859,4.675496688741722
299932,5,6300248569,"As a Jane Austen aficionado, I inevitably judge movie adaptions of her books by how faithfully the movie follows her script.  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most frequently adapted of her works, but while most begin well frequently time constraints cause the director to compress and change frantically in the middle or the end until what one has is a travesty rather than an adaption.  The lovely thing about this BBC adaption is that time is taken.  The plot proceeds, by and large, as Jane wrote it, with letters being written and read in the voice of the character who wrote them with the recipient reacting for the camera.  This causes the action to unfold in a way that matches my visualization when I read the book. I did note the omission of one scene near the end. The scene where Elizabeth has to convince her father that she has changed her mind about Darcy has sadly been omitted, but this is the only major scene from the book that does not occur in this adaption.

Another match for my fictional reverie is the way the cast so completely inhabit their roles.  David Rintoul may not be the most passionate Darcy, but his striking appearance and stately air match my impression of this character.  Elizabeth Garvie is a lively, witty Elizabeth Bennett complete to the sparkling eyes. All the other characters are well done: Mr. Collins, Bingley, and the Bennett sisters.  No one performance here is the best ever done, but the acting here is exact and splendid with no weaknesses.

Some small liberties have been taken; I find them entertaining and allowable because they are small.  This lush BBC production is highly recommended if one has the time to enjoy all five episodes!",1240790400,2,1693,4.6891891891891895
299933,4,6300248569,"So many people have provided exzcellent, detailed reviews that I wanted to add only two points.  The first is that the editing of the BBC serialization for VHS/DVD seemed a bit haphazard and omitted many scenes that made conversations and transitions smooth.  If I remember correctly, there were six episodes, and the home version is significantly shorter.  The second is that each version of Elizabeth portrays her with less of the amused detachment that characterized her in the book, and with more ill temper.  I believe that, in the book, Darcy was not a central figure in Elizabeth's life until Wickham began to weave his web of lies about him.  Had Elizabeth not been interested in Wickham, Darcy would have been a very minor player in her life.  After all, she had been apprised from the beginning that he had no interest in her, and he was socially so much her superior (despite her being a gentleman's daughter)that she could have had no expectations from that quarter.  Darcy was merely a source of great amusement to Elizabeth until she was deceived into thinking him Wickham's malefactor.  The A & E version created a chronically cranky Elizabeth, and, in the latest version with Keira Knightly, I don't think she spent five minutes of screen time in a happy frame of mind.  These are the modern interpretations of how Elizabeth would behave if she were a contemporary of the viewer, not as she would have been in Jane Austen's time.  A sprightly, lighthearted, but witty Elizabeth gets my vote over the dour, self-involved versions.",1239235200,2,1545,4.862595419847328

The sets do seem a bit cramped, as if it's Longbourne in a sound stage instead of just Longbourne, but, of course, I was spoiled with the cinematography of the BBC version before I watched this. If this is your first Pride and Prejudice movie experience, skip it and try the BBC version or the Kiera Knightley version (if you don't have six hours) first.

It is fairly faithful to the book, filmed on location, with well done period costumes and styling. The acting by in large may be just a tad too wooden, but not enough to detract from the timelessness of the story.

The casting in this version is spot on for many characters.  Particularly well cast are Elizabeth (though Keira Knightly is still my favorite Elizabeth), Mrs. Bennet, Lydia, Aunt and Uncle Gardner, Mr. Collins, Charlotte, and Lady Catherine. (The only reason I do not include Darcy is that everyone has their own Mr. Darcy and in my opinion there are as many Mr. Darcys as there are readers and/or viewers!)

It has some scenes deleted or greatly minimalized and some of the characters are not well developed.  However, overall, it is well done.

The central character in this version is definitely Elizabeth. Everything is shown from her exclusive viewpoint. It is not even easy to intuit the thinking and motivation of Darcy in particular, or other characters as well.

If you can have only one version of a tv presentation of P&P, I would say buy this one if you are more interested in seeing the Elizabeth as the guiding character but if you would like to see one where Darcy shares the spotlight, get the Colin Firth version.  The best choice:  GET BOTH!",1234569600,2,1710,5.307407407407408
299937,5,6300248569,"This relatively old version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" holds up excellently.  While I also like the newer versions of Jane Austen's most famous novel, I think the 1980 version is a superb adaptation.  First, this version is very faithful to the book, in details and in spirit.  Second, the acting is terrific without being overstated or flashy.  Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul are outstanding in their portrayals of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy respectively.

I was also moved by one subplot in particular, the film's sensitive and insightful depiction of Elizabeth Bennet's parents.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are unsuited for each other in interests and temperament.  Their lack of marital harmony is the dark undercurrent to their family life.  Mr. Bennet's bitterness, indifference and cynicism have caused him to neglect his daughters' upbringing, care and protection, as well as the potential improvement of his wife.  Mrs. Bennet's frivolous vanity and lack of moral depth have rubbed off on some of her daughters.  Yet despite these grave disappointments and failures, the Bennets still maintain their family unit and their family loyalty.  The price was high for both of them, but the results were also impressive.

On the negative side the cinematography cannot compare to later versions.  The film, originally produced for British and Australian television, has the washed out look characteristic of television shot on leaner budgets.  One sees the same look in many other British television productions of the 70s and 80s.

But this detracts not at all from the excellent screenplay, the attention to detail, the film's reserve and repudiation of trendy innovation and revisionism, and its faithfulness to the original story.  Unfortunately too many screenwriters, directors and actors feel they can use classical literature and a historical setting to project their own views and ideologies.  This at times may be interesting artistically, but usually twists or ruins the meaning of the original story and distorts history.  Even filmmakers who have no ambitious personal statement to make in a film adaptation will often throw in touches of extra romance, sensuality, and suspense to make an old classic more attractive to a wider range of viewers.  Using film and television to faithfully adapt the classics is much richer and more satisfying, because the film medium benefits from the very qualities that made the written work a classic in the first place.

I highly recommend the 1980 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to anyone looking for a faithful and literary version of the classic and who will not be put off by the relative simplicity of the production.",1233100800,4,2675,5.220140515222482

I'm very sorry to say that this is the worst version of P&P I have ever seen.

The best that I can say for this version is that it was--technically--accurate. The plot, characters, sets, and costumes were all in order. The fun, however, ends there. Whoever directed this apparently told the actors to assume their positions, strike a pose, and only then say their lines. Elizabeth Bennet failed to charm, her family failed to capture attention either for praise or censure, and Mr. Darcy had a brick-like countenance that seemed impervious to change. During the many interminable hours that this movie encompassed, he managed precisely two variations of expression: first from impassivity to boredom, then back to impassivity. I've never seen an actor act less.

In all, it was boring. I finished it out of loyalty to the genre, not out of any real enjoyment. Honestly, I've had as much fun watching statues grow moss.",1233100800,7,1128,4.75

David Rintoul gives a great performance as Mr Darcy, his aloofness and manner are as you imagine Darcy to be. The cast as a whole do a stirling job and if you haven't see it i would recommend buying this dvd, i was over the moon when i saw it was available, i have waited years to get hold of this version. i just wish they would release the bbc's version of Rebecca with Jeremy Brett, i think it was made around the same time.",1231804800,2,724,4.37037037037037

Essentially, I think this version (vs. the Colin Firth A&E version) adheres to the novel better and to the spirit of Jane Austen. While I enjoy that version and Mr. Firth, it includes scenes not in the novel,  has a more modern sensibility and is more overtly romantic (though not as romantic as the 2005 version).

I believe Jane Austen's words are the real joy of this version. They come alive and absolutely sparkle in the hands of these actors! In addition, there are two characters that I believe are distinctly better in this version: Lady Catherine is delicious and infuriating, and Mr. Collins is a comic gem of a performance. The first proposal scene is I believe word for word from the novel and played to perfection. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as accessible to modern audiences as Colin Firth's, but I believe Rintoul's performance is more subtle and closer to Austen's intent. I like the narration in this version giving voice to Elizabeth's (and Austen's) inner thoughts, which are always clever and insightful.

I am a strong believer in a great sexual attraction between Elizabeth and Darcy (after all, what else could have attracted a rich man to a poor girl in those days?). Didn't see any chemistry between them in this film. Darcy was so stiff, I couldn't find anything attractive about him, whereas I fantacise (A LOT!) about Colin Firth's and Matthew McFayden's Darcys. Elizabeth Bennett is nice enought, cute and witty, but appeared a litlle gold-diggerish in this version. Didn't like how Lydia's storyline was portrayed either. But overall worth watching

299944,5,6300248569,"I originally watched this version on Masterpiece Theatre in the early 1980s and am so pleased that it is now available on DVD.  Like most of the other reviewers, I have seen the 1995 A&E version, and while I can understand the appeal of 1995 version (quality of cinematography, sound, etc.), not to mention that A&E spiced it up in order to appeal to late 20th century viewers, I prefer the 1980 version.  The 1980 version is truer to the book; I get a much better sense of the relationships (Austen's novels are all about relationships) the characters, not just Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, have with one another, and there are no gratuitous scenes such as Mr. Darcy's wet shirt and the sight of one of the young Bennett sisters in her underwear, which apparently the 1995 producers thought necessary to include in order to appeal to modern viewers. Much as I am a Colin Firth fan, I actually prefer David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy.  Some of the reviewers commented that he was too wooden, not emotional enough, but that is precisely how Jane Austen wrote his character--you begin to see him show more emotion later in the series, particularly when he learns of Lydia's running off to London with Mr. Wickham.  In the book, as in the 1980 version, Mr. Darcy is a ""proud"" man;  proud of his money, his property, his position in society, his family, his background, his connections, and he distrusts and despises those who are not his social equals, like the Bennett girls.  I also liked the other actors in the 1980 version much better than those in the 1995 version, particularly Mrs and Mr Bennett, Jane, Lydia, Mr. Wickham, Judy Parfitt, and particularly Elizabeth.  They all portray their characters much, much closer to how Jane Austen wrote them, and you get a much better sense of their relationships.  The 1995 version is okay in its own way, but if you're looking for the truest adaption of Austen's novel, the 1980 version is it.",1217203200,3,1930,4.672566371681416
299945,5,6300248569,"I first saw this version on Masterpiece Theater in the early 80's when I was in high school.  I had not read the book yet at that time but I was quite captivated by Elizabeth Garvie's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet.  (My being a 16 year old boy also might have had something to do with it.) Unfortunately I missed the final episode so I had to get the book.  I have lost count how many times I have read it since. It is by far my favorite book which is a little odd since I tend to read Sci-Fi and Fantasy books usually.

 I bought the VHS set as soon as it was available for both the 1980 and 1995 productions and I now own all three of the newer versions on DVD.  I watched them all this weekend and found myself unintentionally comparing them.  What I found is that, while I like them all, the 1980 adaptation is my favorite by a small margin over the 1995 one.  The 2005 has it's merits and I really do like Keira Knightly as Elizabeth.  Of the three she is the only one who acts like she is truly not yet one and twenty :-).

It seems to me that the 1980 version is a tad closer to the book than the 1995 version in terms of the dialogue and the use of actual lines from the book.  The production and scenery in the 1995 and 2005 versions are better than the 1980 one but the wit and humor are what carries the story for me and that is what ultimately leads me to enjoy the 1980 version best.

As to the character portrayals I prefer the following:

Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, Caroline Bingley, Louisa Hurst, Charlotte Lucas, Wickam, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner - The1980 version

Darcy, Bingley, Lady Catherine and Anne DeBourgh, Gorgianna Darcy, Sir William Lucas, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Hurst - The 1995 Version

Jane Bennet - The 2005 version

Elizabeth Bennet - Too close to call 1980 and 2005

While it may be slightly different from the A & E version in its own way its just as good.  It is interesting to watch this one and compare the various characters with the A & E version.  The mother is not as hysterical.  Mr Collins is not as goofy.  The father is definitely much more cynical, sarcastic and bitter.  I didn't despise this Catherine DeBourgh and Mr Wickham as much as in the A & E production.  Concerning Jane and Bingley I have no opinion.  Their blandness transends time and interpretations.

Elizabeth Garvie played the clever and beautiful Lizzie Bennett to perfection. David Rintoul was very good as Darcy as well (although some would argue he was little ""too"" serious). The adaptation with Colin Firth is very good too, but it comes in a distant second to this one. I would recommend this to any Jane Austen fan.",1208131200,,545,4.515151515151516
299959,4,6300248569,"This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is the 1980 BBC miniseries,adapted by British novelist Fay Weldon and is a very faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. It consists of five episodes and stars the engaging Elizabeth Garvie as Ms Elizabeth Bennet and the aristocratic-looking and handsome David Rintoul as Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.

This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.

Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.

As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet,Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily and deferential], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.

What lets down this older adaptation is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatisation. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.

On the whole, I find it hard to fault this adaptation. It will always remain one of my favorite adaptations, not just of Pride and Prejudice, but of Austen's works as it is very faithful and well-cast. I recommend this to all Janeites and also those who have only watched the 1995 adaptation and the movie version starring Keira Knightley.",1207785600,7,2755,4.916129032258064

We, who both LOVED the 1995 version- turned this version off about only ten minutes in!  We couldn't stand the 80's way that it was filmed... and didn't like the characters one bit.
Well... after now having finished the book- this is my favorite version!  It is so true to the story- and I think that the casting job was extraordinary.  This Elizabeth is more like the girl Jane Austen writes about- not angry and mad at Darcy the way that Kiera Knightley's Elizabeth acts- but a clever and endearing young woman.  So... if you're' like me and at first you didn't like this... first read the book then try again :)",1207699200,2,732,4.392592592592592

299962,3,6300248569,"I thought it was okay. Just okay. Definitely not my favorite. It is from 1980, and the interior lighting is overly harsh; the exteriors are fine but come as a shock in comparison. Mr Darcy is icy, prideful, aloof--so totally believable--but Elizabeth Garvey as Elizabeth Bennet was lacking as she did not show any charism or anything that would make her stand out to the likes of Mr Darcy. ""For my part, I confess I could never see any beauty in her..."" And I'm not just meaning physical beauty. No sparkle.

Some of the dialog was cut and pasted--having other characters say the words. Usually in adaptations, I don't mind it if it serves flow and continuity, but it seemed to serve no purpose. I love watching all P&P films and though I own this DVD, it's not one I watch over and over.

Um, did you notice that in the book Charlotte's sister and father went to visit her and  Eliza accompanied them? Not to mention all the dialog not found in the book that people kept spouting. Yes, I thought Mr. Collins was better portrayed by the BBC actor, but Mrs. Bennet in the A&E version is a scream. The BBC version kept having to  place dialog where it didn't belong because they spent time inventing lines not in the book and then cramming all the real written dialog into places where I didn't think it sounded right! Not at all as good as I had hoped it would be. I do have to say that this Mr. Darcy a was stone fox! Yow!",1205193600,4,810,4.05625

299965,3,6300248569,"Both versions are worth watching, mainly for the contrast they provide. This will repeat other reviewers to some degree.

BBC - Faithful to the book in lifestyle and pacing, and in the presentation of careful and restrained manners.  Bennet sisters do look as though they belong together, though the Bingley sisters do not.  But, and it's a big but:  Many of the performances are wooden or shallow.  Elizabeth lacks the wit and sparkle of the book, and says teasing lines seriously.  Darcy tries so hard to be supercilious that he removes all life and intelligence from the character.  Mrs. Bennet appears to walk on a stage and deliver memorized lines rather than inhabit her character, and she is fluffy and shallow rather than extremely silly (an interpretation which a viewer might prefer).  Lydia never does anything embarassing or shocking till we are told she has run off. We don't see seriously egregious behavior from anyone that would offend Darcy. The best performances are the ones which are terribly flawed in the A&E version:  Caroline Bingley here is pretty, elegant, and very catty.  Collins is perfect, exactly the combination of obsequiousness and self-importance Austen described.  And Mary Bennet is also believable as a girl who is trying hard to be spiritual and elevated above her sisters. One other flaw:  they added a lot of extra scenes with Charlotte Lucas/Collins which weren't really necessary and far more intrusive than the very small additions that A&E did.

A&E - Very beautiful movie. Almost all of the secondary characters are over-played, but we felt that actually helped the viewer catch Austen's intentions, because a viewer has to apprehend the character without the advantage of going back to re-read. Collins and Caroline Bingley are really poorly done, injecting cartoon qualities that interrupt the flow of others' good acting. But this version has a big advantage in that all the actors threw themselves into their parts, and seem believable (except for the two above). We really prefer this interpretation of Elizabeth and Darcy, because while not overdone, they are understandable.  She is witty, self-assured, and laughing at everyone.  Darcy, a very difficult character to pull off, comes off much as Austen describes:  haughty but intelligent, and fascinated by Elizabeth.  And we forgive A&E for having him swim on his own property in defiance of the book. So, in spite of the over-acting, we like the A& E version very much.",1204070400,5,2475,5.086633663366337
299966,3,6300248569,"I believe I may have watched this in English class in high school, and yet it isn't quite the way I remembered it.  I'm wondering if there was another version (PBS, maybe?) prior to 1990. Overall, this is a good telling of Pride and Prejudice, if you can get past the fact that it IS a bit dated.  It is difficult to write a review of this version without comparing it to the 1995 version, because they are both good, and come closer to representing the book than the alternatives, including the horrible 2005 version.

  Casting and character development - What is good about this version:  Jane was prettier than in the 1995 version.  (Susannah York in the 1995 version was pretty, but the way they styled her hair did not really suit the shape of her face.)  Lydia seems a little sweeter than in the '95 version - silly, capable of being led astray, boy-crazy, but not as trampy.  I think this is more accurate.  Mrs. Bennet, too, seems more harmless in this version.  She is silly, she lacks a sense of propriety, but she is more likeable. The overall casting of the Bennet girls is better - their facial features bear enough similarities that they look like they could be siblings. What is not as good:  Lizzy doesn't have quite enough spark to her.  Jennifer Ehle may have been a bit over-the-top in 1995, but she seemed more the lively Eliza Bennet I pictured when reading the book.  Kitty seems a little too old.  Also, I missed Maria Lucas.  Sure, she was a background character, but she provided a contrast with Elizabeth in her behavior toward Lady Catherine.  Without her, Charlotte had to become more obsequious.  In a five hour series, they could have left her in, maybe even had her become the person who got in the way in the scene after Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to dinner at the Bennet's, instead of some strange woman suddenly appearing in the end of the movie. (The woman who prevents, at first, Elizabeth from being able to speak with Mr. Darcy.)  Georgiana seemed a bit underdeveloped, too. I don't remember her actually playing or singing, despite the fact that her musical ability is much touted. The Pemberley scenes feel rushed.  Also, Anne de Bourgh seems a little too likeable.  She doesn't look as sickly, and gives the impression that maybe she really is nice when she seems to want to embrace Elizabeth when they take leave of each other.

The music/costuming/cinematography - this was the reason I only gave the movie three stars, rather than four.  The background music was just GOOFY through most of the movie.  The cinematography was poor quality.  I felt like I was watching reruns of episodes of All My Children from the early 1980s - which was kind of amusing, but distracted from the story.  The costumes were tolerable, but both costumes and hair were somehow reminiscent of the late 1970s early 1980s.  While it did not totally ruin the production, it was a distraction.

Overall, this was a fun rendition to watch.  I can understand why some people prefer this to the 1995 A&E version, but I have to say I prefer the 1995.",1203379200,4,3069,4.60036832412523

I have to say that the very best version, the truest to Jane Austen's vision, the most perfectly cast film version is this version, the 1980 BBC Version.  Yes, Colin Firth in a wet shirt is a sight to behold.  Yes, Dame Judy Dench as Lady Catherine is a pleasure.  However, both versions fall entirely short when faced with the BBC version.  In the BBC Version, Darcy and Elizabeth are perfectly cast.  Mrs. Bennet deserves an Oscar for her great attack of ""nerves.""  This is the very best version.  Yes,.

299981,5,6300248569,"I find it exceedingly paradoxical that so many self-proclaimed Pride and Prejudice fans denigrate the 1980 version, yet adore the inferior, albeit more known 1995 version. Prior to watching this excellent adaptation, the A&E production was admittedly my favourite. I too, like so many other P+P enthusiasts adored it upon the first viewing. It wasn't so much the portrayal of the characters in the 1995 production that impressed me, rather, it was the dialogue, the scenery (for obvious reasons) and how naturally everthing unfolded. I took some issue with some of the liberties the director took-Mr Darcy jumping into the vermin filled pool etc.-but the dialogue between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth charmed me enough that I was able to overlook those minor foibles of the 1995 version.

Imagine my surprise, or horror rather, when I bought this version and discovered that the an inordinate amount of the dialogue from the 1995 version was sufficiently similar to the dialogue from this version as to render the dialogical origin of the 1995 version suspect. The discussion between Eliza and Mr. Darcy at Netherfield about pride and vanity and how the latter is a fault, but the former is justified if there is a true superiority of mind is one example that I cite; another is Miss Bingley's speech about ""Elizabeth's lack of beauty"" at Pemberley: ""I remember you said, Mr. Darcy, she a beauty, I should sooner call her mother a wit.""

That said, I haven't forgotten about the lamentable travesty that is the 2005 version. I first I knew I was in trouble when I witnessed the overtly rustic, pathetic excuse of a house the Bennets supposedly lived in. The 'manners,' or lack of manners, rather, that Keira's Elizabeth posessed made me wonder what it was that was so superior about her in comparison to her sisters or the rest of her lot in general. Leave it to Hollywood to confuse Elizabeth with a modern day feminist. Uncoventional, outspoken and witty Elizabeth may have been, but a shrill, ill-bred feminist she certainly was not. As for Mr. Darcy...the hair, the hair, the air, the complete lack of an air of nobility, of pride, of principle and goodness beneath his veneer of...pride, what pride? If you ask me, he merely appeared pathetic and dejected throughout the entire film. Why anyone was offended by his pathetic, melancholy countenance is beyond me. I felt sorry for the guy.

This version is infinitely superior to the other two, alhough the 1995 version does have its merits. Garvie's Elizabeth is wonderfully realized. She is at once impertinent, witty, sweet, and sympathetic. Rintoul's Darcy is handsome and certainly aristocratic, although I thought he could have softened up a bit in the latter part of the film where he is supposedly humbled. The secondary characters are also excellent. The budget did not hinder the beauty of this production. The costumes look realistic and it isn't without its share of the picturesque sceneries that poeple so admire about the 1995 version. Without a doubt, this is the version to watch for Jane Austen fans who admire her work not merely for their romantic plots, but for their wit, their distinct sense of humour, and their colorful and diverse characters.",1186531200,5,3216,4.951851851851852

299984,2,6300248569,"After watching BBC's effort on the novel itself while they withstood in keeping with the storyline and did an exceptional job in doing such I was extremely disheartened in the job of the actors.  I did not find myself drawn into the story such as the novel,the A&E Version or even the version of Keara Knightly.  Matter of fact I found myself bored out of my witts with it.  There was no real humanity offered onscreen, the characters seemed lacking, the actors seemed like they were doing a job and not really acting... this by far was a disappointment in itself.

I wanted to fall in love with the characters and instead I found myself disliking them.  The beautiful and graceous Jane seemed disinteresting and flat almost cold.  The disatisfied Elizabeth had more affection to her than her sister and sadly the goofy and silly younger sisters did not come across as such.  Perhaps I had been expecting better acting so my expectations were not met.

If you are looking to fall in love with the characters as you did while reading the novel itself I would highly suggest getting the version with Knightly, Mcfayden and sutherland... as they appear more human and actually breath fresh life into their roles.  While that version has been changed in some degrees and cut down to fit the movie theatre time frames it has a MUCH more likeable and loveable air to it.

Sorry BBC, while you managed to keep within the guildelines of the novel (BRAVO for that)  your actors seemed very lacking and inhuman in their attmempts to become the parts they were paid to play.",1184544000,6,1563,4.647272727272727

299986,4,6300248569,"I really enjoy this 1979 production of Pride and Prejudice, finding that it still holds up very well compared to the Colin Firth version of 1995, which I also immensely enjoy; also when compared to the 2005 movie with Keira Knightley, which, again, I also very much enjoy.  They all have good things to offer in their own unique way.  I may as well toss in the 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.  It's definitely old MGM/Hollywood, but, hey, it's cool in its own way, too.  Well, onward with my thoughts on the 1979 BBC version.

First, the production itself is purposely more simplistic and uncluttered in nature.  It's not a technical or artistic triumph by any means.  However, I found myself attracted to the simple nature of it all, perhaps in a strange way reflecting simpler times.  For example, you can hear the room ambience via the simple miking techniques. It sounds like you are right there in the room.  The audio is not produced to make each actor sound up close to you, therefore making it sound more like real life in a real room.  Well, this is just one example.  Overall, the film has the look and feel of a stage play, though it's not on a stage.  I will admit, though, that the photography often looks a bit soft, and there are some exposure problems.  In one scene (can't remember now where it is--somewhere in the second half?), it looks like the sun came out and then went back behind a cloud.  You can see the effect on a building.  Weird.

All technical and artistic considerations aside (some of you may have to try hard to set these things aside), I found myself very much enjoying almost all of the the cast members and story presentation, which, I believe, are the real issues here.  I believe Elizabeth Garvie is wonderful in her role.  However, I would have preferred that David Rintoul's portrayal of Darcy not be so stiff.  If he had been less stiff, his relationship with Elizabeth would appear to be more real.  I'm sure he's a fine actor, so I must assume his portrayal of Darcy is the full intention of the producers of the film.  Though I haven't yet had the chance to read the book, I've heard that Darcy isn't this stiff in the book.

I like Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Bennett (not as shrill as the 1995 version) and all the other sisters, especially Jane.  She's better than the other gal in the l995 version, whose facial features are kind of funny, almost slightly boyish.  The 1979 Jane is much better.  I also like Mr. Bingley in this '79 version, but I don't like Mr. Collins as well as the 1995 version.  He's too much like a buffoon here.  Lady Catherine is excellent here, however.

There are some small details missing as compared to the 1995 version.  Certain scenes in the 1995 version are more fleshed out.  One thing I found likeable in the 1979 version, though, is when we can hear Lizzie's personal thoughts.  That nice touch really makes it sound intimate to the viewer.

Well, we could spend lots of time comparing versions, and comparing all of them to the book.  There are too many details concerning the characters and story presentation to list them here.  Shall we also count the times the actors quote from the book compared to the 1995 version or the movies?  I'm not going there.

I try to enjoy each movie and mini-series on its own merits.  In the end, it doesn't really matter, anyway.  Pick whichever one you like and just appreciate the others.  They all help us appreciate Jane Austen's writing.  The same can be said of the various movie and mini-series versions of Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, etc.

I hope I've been able to persuade someone out there to check out this 1979 version of Pride and Prejudice and enjoy it.  Every movie and mini-series version of this book brings something to the table, so I hope you enjoy this version, too.",1181692800,6,3836,4.54014598540146

It is rather faithful to the book, in dialogue and casting - I don't think any other Darcy I've seen has been prouder than this.

What seems to be wrong you ask??

Well simply put it really isn't consistant with the book and the characters and settings seem off.  But yes it is still in England and yes there are the same main characters BUUUTT that's pretty much all I can tell from watching it.

THe MAIN Characters:

Well let's see, the main hero and THE greatest man in classical literature, Mr. Darcy

........ Mr. Darcy well he's handsome alright but nothing like a Mr. Darcy should be.  This Mr. Darcy is unemotional and just seems like a stuck up jerk, he doesn't seem shy or bored with society but simply dull and well, I absolutely hate him as a person.

**Sulking is not acting, I sulk everyday and I've never won an Oscar.**

Elizabeth was alright, I thought she was cute and clever, but not exactly what you would want as an Elizabeth.  I did like her though.

I do have one question...

WHO wrote this sad sad script???? and why was Elizabeth, after Darcy proposed, smiling and quirky??? this jerk just asked her to marry her against his better thoughts and wishes and COMPLETELY dissed her family and called them idiots... yep i would really act like that in that situation... she obviously needs a life coach

another thing, after Darcy gives Elizabeth the letter explaining everything the camera is watching Darcy walk away... this actor... (sorry to say) can't walk.. it's like watching a scowling, stomping duck waddle away. (huh?)

in conclusion (if you couldn't tell):

I was very disappointed... the production seemed cheap and the acting very very poor.  You may think from the other reviews that it is worth watching but honestly it is not!

I know that BBC made better movies in the 80's than this.  I just know that they did.

I wish I never bought it and I wish I never saw it, I wish I could throw it away, but that would be a waste of my hard earned money.

GOOD GOD, it's that aweful.

Thank you for listening,

Just so you know I'm obsessed with Pride and Prejudice so I do know a little something.

Just remember when watching this version that you are watching a book made into a movie, not a movie loosely based on a book.  This version is charming and while it will never get an Academy Award, Jane Austen would I think be very pleased with it.

Oh, don't bother with the version from the 40's.  I began watching it and it is set in the 1840's and made out to be like a Dicken's story.  It's way too far off base.",1165104000,10,1160,4.0174672489082965
300009,3,6300248569,"This 1985 BBC mini-series is an adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel.  While all Austen novels revolve around the universally acknowledged truth that, ""a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,"" her protagonists are always of the fairer sex.

Jane Austen novels are set at a slower time and written for people who had the time to read them.  They are leisurely affairs to be read over days.  That production, with 265 minutes on a two-sided disk has the time to develop the plot.  Although the opening scene is significantly altered from Austen's novel, whole pages of text are presented verbatim.  Unfortunately, the acting is more like that of a stage production with long lines of dialogue.  The actors often delivered their lines word for word from the book but these were talking heads.  They regularly stood tall and stiff with only slight interaction with the set and sadly limited facial expression or feeling.  Mr. Collins, in this version, is closer to the person described by Austen, handsome not all that bright and overly concerned with class and status.  The cinematography is generally good but sometimes the lighting would leave faces in shadow for no apparent reason.  The musical score was weak and dated.  My wife, also an aficionado of period movies, felt this version was agony and quit watching.

While there is a 1939 version of Pride and Prejudice, with Maureen O'Sullivan, I have not yet seen it.  The three versions I have seen and reviewed are the 1996 BBC and A&E version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, the 2005 Universal Studios version with Keira Knightley and this 1985 BBC production.  I can recommend the first two versions, for different reasons, but this adaptation is flawed and the least enjoyable of the three.

300011,1,6300248569,"I rented this edition of P&P over the weekend to watch with a fellow Austen fanatic, and we both hated it. We have seen nearly every version of this classic tale, and this one is at the very bottom. The actors are horrible, especially Mr. Darcy, who has the same face and shows the exact same emotion throughout the whole movie until the very end. There is very little chemistry between him and Elizabeth, so it made it harder to believe the ending, unlike in other editions. It is extremely slow-moving, edited very poorly, and very little art or music direction. It was actually very painful to watch the whole 4 hours, and I would never recommend this version to anyone. The A&E/BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth still reign supreme to me. Despite some problems, it is the most believable, most romantic, most beautifully done production of Pride and Prejudice.",1162771200,9,877,4.738562091503268
300012,4,6300248569,"A very nice rendition of the novel; the BBC does great work!  The sets are nothing to its 1995 successor, but the respective scores fit each.  Here, the music is very homey and ""small-ish"" to fit the image, and music for Collins is hilarious; in the 1995 version, the energetic score fits the opening scenes wonderfully.  Plus, this DVD beats the 1995 DVD on sound quality, hands down.

Jane (Sabina Franklyn) is terrific and I prefer her Jane, although I like Harker's; it is puzzling, though, when she beats on Darcy for snubbing Lizzy when Jane is supposed to think well of everyone. Mrs. Bennet is less shrill than her '95 version. Interesting interpretation of Anne (she likes Lizzy).  Mrs. Gardiner is done *very* well.  Lady Catherine feels truly like a rude *noble*woman, like she was born into her title.  Judy Parfitt's performance is, for me, the best.

Unfortunately, the major drawback of this version is that the other side characters are not as good, and many are just plot-movers; in '95 they're fuller characters.  Mary's too hurt about being snubbed.  Charlotte is oddly very happy about Collins and de Bourgh, rather than contentedly resigned.  Moray Watson's Mr. Bennet doesn't work and is probably furthest from the novel.  He's far too severe and looks mad all the time and thus makes the lines of ""sarcastic humor"" seem harsh.

The Bingleys are all right here, but it's hard to top '95's catty (and orange) Chancellor and the adorably eager Bonham-Carter.  Col. Fitzwilliam here is too stiff and serious, although he looks the part; he just doesn't measure up to Calf's '95 Fitzwilliam, who is the guy to a T (except Calf is too good-looking).

But it is a truth universally acknowledged that the success of a ""P&P"" version rides on its Elizabeth and Darcy, and this is where this one succeeds.

Elizabeth Garvie *is* Elizabeth physically--slight of figure, pretty, light brown hair.  The character, oddly, is a bit over eager; Darcy's criticism of Jane (""she smiles too much"") works for this Lizzy.  She smiles so much during the Hunsford proposal that when Darcy accuses her of incivility he comes across as oversensitive.

She also seems to care too much what Darcy and the others think; in this version, her desire to go home when Jane's sick seems motivated by how upset she is because of her hosts' behavior rather than the novel's reason of not wishing to be an improper guest who overstays her welcome. She also seems to fall harder for Wickham than the novel indicates.

Even so, Garvie captures Lizzy on other levels.  She's funny and impertinent, just like Lizzy is supposed to be.  Her teasing Bingley is beautifully done, as in the novel, and her line that marrying Mr. Darcy would no doubt scare Anne is hilariously delivered, as is her conversation with Charlotte about Collins' hat.

IMHO, the main problem with this Lizzy is a little inconsistency, and it seems more the inconsistency in the lines than with Garvie.  Besides caring too much what others think, she gets over Darcy's revelation about Jane and Bingley too quickly, and the Pemberley scene is done poorly (more on that later).  But all in all, still terrific.

My only objection to David Rintoul is that the novel doesn't make Darcy *that* uptight; Rintoul doesn't smile even a tenth of the times the novel says Darcy does.  At times he's so stiff and emotionless one wonders if Skynet didn't just send Terminators to 1984.  Still, Rintoul carries Darcy admirably and (at the risk of being pelted with rotten veggies) is a handsomer Darcy than Firth.  When he and Elizabeth are engaged and he finally smiles, it's beautiful, and it's all Darcy.  Much, *much* preferred to Macfayden's 2005 kicked-puppy looking Darcy.

Garvie and Rintoul carry the major scenes beautifully.  Whoever did the shot where we first hear Elizabeth play and sing is brilliant; everyone stands stock still, and we see only Darcy moving between them, watching her.  It's powerful in its simplicity.  Some of the voiceovers of Lizzy's thoughts are annoying, but some are good; one nicely supplies the ultimate paradox of how Darcy supplied objections to Jane for Bingley but loves Lizzy so much he can't help but bypass them for Lizzy.

Some complain '95's Ehle and Firth are too old.  If it's young-looking we're going for, I still prefer Garvie and Rintoul (whatever their ages) over Knightley and Macfayden, even if Rintoul wasn't that young when he did Darcy.  Garvie and Rintoul carry the relationship more closely to the novel.

As completely enjoyable as Garvie and Rintoul are - and they are *well* worth the 4.5 hours - my favorites are still Ehle and Firth.  Darcy isn't entirely stiff in the novel and smiles quite a bit even in the first half.  Firth makes these tiny, unconscious smiles, and he shows hurt and delight far better even with the proud mask.  Ehle may not look the part, even with her wigs, but she conveys Lizzy's spirit the best - that sweet, pert confidence is always there, and until she discovers Darcy's true nature, it's very clear she doesn't care for his good opinion.  It's also far clearer when she's simply being polite and when she's truly happy; she doesn't use the same smile for both.

As for the visit to Pemberley: I'm no wet-shirt-maniac (I don't get it: he's fully clothed and the shirt doesn't even stick to him), and purists can say what they will about that 1995 dip in the pond :) , but that innovation does a far better job of explaining why Darcy doesn't receive the Gardiners and Lizzy properly the first time he sees them; he's half-dressed.  In  this version he sees them, he's unbelievably cold, and then suddenly he reappears all charming.  It's like two different Darcies.  Also, Ehle's Elizabeth is more consistent.  She's mortified she's going to seem a gold-digging floozy, so she rushes to leave; Ehle conveys her dismay brilliantly.  In the 1980 version, Lizzy's embarrassment is confined to a short voiceover, but she doesn't leave and otherwise looks perfectly content, all in sharp contrast to her condemnation of her sisters' flirty behavior with the officers.  The awkwardness of their first meeting after the Hunsford refusal is also done far better in the '95 version than in its '80 predecessor.

Still, a fabulous version and a must-see for a ""P&P"" fan.",1161216000,13,6301,4.847521047708138

CONS:
1. this version tries too hard to stay true to the book (which could be a plus) but the stagey daytime soap-opera look and feel is not engaging
2. the theatrical acting and pacing fails to make the characters alive and endearing (e.g. Jane Bennet, though agreeably the most beautiful Bennet, makes you wonder if she's a bit retarded instead of being kind at heart; Bingley appears flaky; Darcy's condescending manner is ridiculous and Elizabeth has limited range of emotions)

She competently pronounces her lines, but with little variation regardless of the context, or seeming understanding of the novel's subtext.  Darcy is a little better, but without a compelling Lizzy it hardly matters.

The script and direction are truly poorly paced.  Important scenes are rushed over, and unimportant scenes drag on and on.  At times, additional dialogue not from the novel is thrown in for no apparent purpose other than to slow down a scene.

The production values are typical 1980-ish British Television, so there's nothing visually arresting to distract you from the painfully tedious proceedings.

However.

This screenwriter fell into the trap, I believe, of making this adaptation too bookish.

There are scenes where one is subjected to several minutes of Elizabeth's THOUGHTS. Sorry. That doesn't work.

Darcy and Elizabeth have ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY. The casting was horrendous - Darcy was a fop, Elizabeth had something disturbing about her eyes - they certainly were not fine.

The entire filming is horridly steeped in the 1970's - every girl had permed hair, the soundtrack was almost anachronistic, with the inclusion of saxophone, even.

Mrs. Bennet was the highlight of this, I think, as she managed to balance silly country woman with caring mother with a believable lack of propriety.

300022,5,6300248569,"My wife and I saw this 1979 (Elizabeth Garvie) version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" in the early-1980's.  It was shown on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre--before we owned a VCR.  Five years later, we bought the VHS tape for $60, and were very happy to have it. Now here comes the DVD version with 39 extra minutes of valuable scenes that were not included in the VHS tape.  What a bargain this is!

This version of the story is rather different from the 1995 Colin Firth series in that so much of it is done from Elizabeth's point of view.  She provides insights and commentary all along the way, some of which are mistaken.  If forced to choose, we'd tend to prefer the Colin Firth version, especially with him cast as Mr. Darcy.  Also, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett are played more whimsically and are more sympathetic characters in the 1995 edition.  Nevertheless, there is a lot to like in the 1979 version and would recommend that people buy both and compare.

Lesser characters like Mr. and Mrs. Collins, the other Bennett sisters, Lady Catherine, and the Bingleys make for a study in contrast, 1979 vs. 1995.  Both versions are enjoyable for what they show of human nature.  Moreover, the natural scenery and background music in both productions are just outstanding.

As to faithfulness to Jane Austen's book, both versions offer departures that are not necessarily bad.  Toward the end, where Lady Catherine confronts Elizabeth about her possible attachment to Darcy, the Colin Firth version really is closer to the book. (The scene is supposed to take place outside in Bennetts' side garden, not indoors. Nevertheless, Judy Parfitt plays Lady Catherine memorably in the 1979 version).  In some other areas, though, the 1979 version is more faithful to the author.  There was no double wedding at the end of the book, yet there is at the end of the Colin Firth version.

One disappointing feature of this Elizabeth Garvie DVD is the absence of any Special Features or ""making of"" piece. Ms. Garvie is still very much alive and it would have been interesting to get her comments on either or both productions. (There's quite a good ""making of"" feature with the latest Colin Firth edition and a still better one expected this fall).

300023,5,6300248569,"I believe that everyone should get the version they want; but if you haven't seen either version, it is difficult to tell which you would like, given the reviews here.  Reactions are polarized.  Proponents of each side say their version has the best acting, the best actors, the best scenery, the best photography, etc. etc.  How can you make an informed choice?

1995: The characters (actors) have a personal style, manner, carriage, tone of voice that is more today's people (even though they wear the costumes of the past).  They are livelier.  Their speech, though British, is today's British.  If this appeals to you, the 1980 version will appear slow, the characters stiff, their subtlety baffling or nonexistent.

And this will be true, even if you've read the book.  Readers project onto the characters in a book the attitudes and style they prefer.

1980: In this version, the actors try to behave, comport themselves and speak in a style and manner which they (or the director) believed people used in 1812.  Screenwriter Fay Weldon, who specializes in writing about the British upper class, fashioned a screenplay which attempts to capture this.  If you like to immerse yourself in the past, doing a little imaginative time-travel, this is the version you'll prefer.

The 1995 version will seem to you completely unrealistic, the characters anachronistic, the lavish color wasted, the acting bad, etc.

An indicator: If you know which version of The Forsyte Saga or The Secret Garden you prefer, you can make a good guess as to which Pride and Prejudice you'll like.  The 1996 Forsyte Saga versus the 1967 Forsyte Saga.  The 1995 Secret Garden versus the 1975 BBC Secret Garden.

(You can no longer go by whether it's BBC.  In recent years, the BBC has changed.  It has tried to cash in on the vast American market by tailoring its products to American styles and tastes.)

It isn't about which side is ""right.""  And it makes absolutely no sense to buy both versions!  Get the version you think you're most likely to appreciate.  You may even prefer the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice if the 1995 version appears ""too slow"".",1150934400,,2140,4.850828729281768

But I must give the edge to the BBC; it's closer in pacing and tone to the slyly satiric original, whereas the A&E version is more swoopingly romantic -- Austen as rewritten by Byron or Shelley.  (Not that that's a bad thing; it's just not authentic.  One can, for example, imagine Austen averting her eyes, if not actually cringing, during Darcy's wet t-shirt scene.)  Also the casting in the BBC is generally better, especially the roles of Mr. Bennet, Jane, Mr. Wickham (fabulously oily!), Caroline Bingley, Charlotte Lucas, and above all Lady Catherine; Judy Parfitt will own that role till the crack of doom.  I couldn't possibly choose between Elizabeth Garvie and Jennifer Ehle; both are quitessential Lizzys, though each embodies different aspects of the character (Garvie the lethal wit and intelligence, Ehle the vivacity and fearlessness).  But I must sound a note of discord to my fellow reviewers' estimation of David Rintoul's Darcy; his exquisitely measured, impeccably calibrated performance is my ideal of the character.  While I love Colin Firth's more brooding, warm-blooded interpretation, Rintoul's is closer to Austen.

The BBC version also has the benefit of being written by an actual novelist (Fay Weldon, whose book LETTERS TO ALICE ON FIRST READING JANE AUSTEN is also highly recommended); all five episodes are beautifully structured, and Weldon's invented scenes glisten with Austen-like hilarity.  By comparison, the otherwise admirable A&E adaptation commits one grave narrative offense: the audience should not discover Darcy's role in Lydia's wedding until Elizabeth does.  It should be as great a shock to us as it is to her.  But A&E reveals Darcy as Lydia's rescuer from the get-go, thereby needlessly dissipating a lot of potentially delicious tension.

But to my original point: in the end, all these qualifications are but quibbles.  Both the BBC and A&E versions are radiant successes, each with its own glories, and I wouldn't dream of being without either of them.  The clear recommendation is to BUY BOTH.  And live happily ever after.",1140134400,29,2257,5.111716621253406
300046,2,6300248569,"How does this original version compare with the later version starring Colin Firth? I found the best way was to compare the characterisations.

Elizabeth: As portrayed here by Elizabeth Garvie, she is a saintly, passive milksop akin to Gone With The Wind's Melanie Wilkes except that Melanie was more spirited. Jennifer Ehle is pouting and petulant but at least she has life. In Garvie's big scenes - the rejection of Collins, Darcy's first proposal, the confrontation with Lady Catherine, she smiles sweetly and shows no fire, no emotion, no nothing. We cannot believe that she is attracted to Darcy in any way, and her voiceovers ('I am mortified') portray her as a shrinking violet. This is not Jane Austen's spirited Elizabeth.

Darcy: No contest here. Colin Firth has defined the character. David Rintoul is uncomfortably stiff. Again, we see none of the swirling emotions he feels about Elizabeth. He appears to dislike her from the beginning. Where is the growth in his respect and love for her? Rintoul is incapable of showing any change in his character, so that the final proposal scene is laughable.

Mr & Mrs Bennet: Alison Steadman was a shrill monster; viewed as caricature she was believable. The actress in the older version is just irritating beyond belief, and her gushing over Lydia and negelect of her other daughters is taken to extremes. Mr Bennet is no longer the kindly soul whose marriage has left him an empty shell but who still loves Elizabeth dearly. In the older version his retreats to the library to escape his wife, while understandable, obliterate his character, and he comes across as grumpy.

The other sisters are cyphers. Lydia is grotesque. She is played in the newer version by Julia Sawalha as not much more than a prostitute (modernised beyond belief) but in the older version, as with Mrs Bennet, she is impossible to watch. I cannot believe that Austen really intended the characters to be as unsympathetic as they are portrayed here. Jane and Bingley barely seem capable of communication let alone love, while Bingley's sisters are obnoxious and unpleasant.

There is far more in Austen's comedy of class and manners than either version can show, but the edge must go to the Colin Firth version, for his portrayal alone, despite the glaring deficiencies of Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth.",1138838400,7,2329,4.961538461538462
300057,4,6300248569,"Of course, nothing compares to Miss Austen's original creation and everything that comes after (books and movies alike) should always be considered as interpretations and judged on their own merit.

I've read and re-read P&P many times in my life, and my first sight of this wonderful work on the (small) screen was with A&E's version (only late last year, actually).  I've admired Mr. Firth's acting talents for a great while now, and I agree with some fellow reviewers that his manner and conduct transition throughout the story much more believable than Mr. Rintoul.

While David Rintoul seems quite handsome enough and his proud demeanor believable, his acting range was very poor indeed.

First sight of him at the assembly was very good. Haughty, proud and disdainful of anyone outside of his immediate acquaintance was conveyed well enough.  But no developing fascination of secretly observing Lizzy at other Hartfordshire gatherings was evident.  All I could detect was the exact same manner of disdain as seen previously.  I saw no development (not even a secretly subtle change in expression).

His first proposal to Elizabeth was rather dull and not wholly believable that he was emotionally engaged when he spoke how 'ardently I love and admire you'.  Mr. Firth's version, while still holding much dignity and arrogance, showed much talent in barely suppressed emotion and much expression in his eyes (trying to conceal his hope and later his hurt).

Also Mr. Rintoul's expression of astonishment of hearing Eliza's reply was equally unvaried and dull.  While in the A&E version... the camera fixed several times on Darcy's face (pointedly: his eyes) and we are able to see (very subtly) the expression changing from one of hope to agony as he first hears Lizzy refuse him.  I saw no such change in Rintoul's expression.  He just seemed angry from the beginning of the scene to the end.

Even as Rintoul entered the room at the beginning of this proposal scene, he seems just plainly angry and sarcastic in his inquiry after her health - instead of anxiously nervous of the proposal he is trying to form in his head.

I did like Sabina Franklyn's Jane a bit better in this 1980 version.  She had a beautiful air and shy countenance which her role required.

I did prefer Jennifer Ehle's performance to Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth. Ms. Ehle's acting talent is superb and transformation into a sterling example of late 1700's gentle lady complete. Ms. Garvie performance reminded me more like Imogen Stubbs's Lucy Steele in 'Sense and Sensibility' (sharp and calculating instead of level-headed, smart and kind).  Also, in this version I didn't sense a close relationship with her father or perhaps inferior scene set up, acting direction or camera work was at fault.

As for the Pond dunking scene... I agree that this was a big departure from Ms. Austen's book - as well as the fencing exercise.  But as we all well know, the book is truly written from Elizabeth's POV and much that happens outside this realm will always be mysterious.  I return to my comments about interpretation.  I think the A&E story line is better for it with additions the screenwriters take adding Darcy's struggle to try to purge Lizzy from his mind:  Aggressive workout with a fencing master... and we are allowed to see his continuing torment later as he returns early to Pemberly and decides to cool his ardor in the frigid waters of his estate's pond.

Oh and I almost forgot to include:

I was appalled at every scene that included dancing in this version of P&P.  I seemed as though last minute recruits from off the streets were employed.  No one seemed to be enjoying themselves, they often stumbled over each other, and most all the dancers were aged over 60 (ie: not a balanced age range).  I liked both A&E's 1996 and the most recent silver screen version (2005) with their display of wonderfully choreographed dancing.  It was plainly evident more time and care (as well as $$) was spent to choice of music and talent of dancers and choreography.  Possibly this detail was not important enough to the project's whole to warrant a larger piece of the budget to do it justice?

I did like this version well enough, but will prefer A&E's.",1136678400,11,4238,4.852573018080667
300058,4,6300248569,"I have a soft spot for this version. I first saw it when it was on Masterpiece Theater with my dad (who died last year) and the rest of my family.

Garvie is the best Elizabeth I've seen, while she didn't have the verve Ehle's Elizabeth has, I feel she is truer to the character of the novel.  Austen's Elizabeth had wit and vivacity, but I don't picture her as forward as Ehle's Elizabeth, who is a modern Lizzy.

I would have loved to see Garvie opposite Firth (of course, she was too old for the role in 1995, so it is just fantasy casting), who I liked as Darcy better.

Firth was able to portray the changes in Darcy which Elizabeth's angry rejection brings about better.  I didn't think Rintoul managed to convey this well.

I liked Mrs. Bennet, she was more restrained than the 1995 version, less cartoonish.

Jane was far superior in this version too.

However, the 1995 version is still my favorite and NOT because of Firth.

I think the 1995 version stuck closer to the novel than this one did.

A few examples:

The scene where Elizabeth gets the letter from Jane alerting her to Lydia's elopement. In the book and the 1995 version,Darcy walks in on her right after she learns the news.

In this version Elizabeth runs to Pemberly (miles) looking for her Aunt and Uncle and dashes in to Darcy's sitting room with barely a knock.

Darcy walking in on her is important, it doesn't make sense she would share her troubles with him if he hadn't caught her unawares.

Especially considering her mortification over her family AND that Wickham was involved. (This bugs me in the 2005 movie too, in that version Darcy is sitting with the Gardners, which again, makes no sense. Why would she tell him once she found her Aunt and Uncle?)

The conversation with Lady Catherine is cut down in this version. Elizabeth's anger is much more muted here than in either the book and the 1995 version.

The second proposal scene. In the book and the 1995 version Elizabeth,Darcy and Kitty go walking with Jane and Bingley. Kitty runs off to see Maria Lucus, then Elizabeth thanks Darcy for his role in Lydia's marriage.

In this version, Darcy sends a note to Elizabeth to meet him in the grove, which she does. This eliminates her fears over Darcy's feelings for her, she is more sure of herself because he has made the first move (by asking her to meet him). In the book and 1995 version, she breaks the ice by thanking him, and later in the book teases him that she made the first move in assuring their happiness. He denies this by saying he was about to bring up Lady Catherine's visit but she beat him to the punch (not in those words of course, LOL).

There is no final scene between Mr. Benett and Elizabeth where he asks for her assurance that she really loves Darcy. It is a touching scene in the book which illustrates the father/daughter bond.

This is not to say this version isn't very good, it is. I love this story and don't think there can be too many versions, if done well.

I am looking forward to a version where they dramatize the end of the book better, the story doesn't end after second proposal. I would love to see The Collins family come running back to escape Lady Catherine's wrath at the news and his subsequent behavior towards Darcy.

In conclusion, while the 1995 version remains my favorite, this one is extremely well done and worth the time",1136419200,9,3369,4.481178396072013
300059,4,6300248569,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" must be in want of a great Mr. Darcy. On that score David Rintoul is the weak link in the BBC's 1980 mini-series, which provides one of the most faithful adaptations of Jane Austen's novel to date.  The role of Fitzwilliam Darcy is tricky because we have to agree with Elizabeth Bennet's harsh judgment that he is the personification of pride early on, be surprised when he offers the most backhanded proposal in English literature, and then warm towards him as Lizzie's opinion change and her affections follow.  On the basis of that transformation rather than on his good looks I still favor Colin Firth in the 1995 BBC as the best Darcy of the bunch having seen six of the ten dating back to the 1938 television version that aired two years before the 1940 MGM movie with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.  There is one moment in this mini-series where Rintoul's Darcy lets down his guard, and his eyebrows, and it is for but a brief scene.  The difference between the haughty Mr. Darcy we meet at the beginning and the happy romantic we are supposed to see at the end is so minimal that you might not even see it.

The rest of the cast fulfills our expectations of the characters in the novel, although I would say that I thought Elizabeth (Elizabeth Garvie) was the best looking one of the Bennet daughters, an honor that is supposed to obviously go to her older sister, Jane (Sabina Frakyln).  But since we are supposed to love Lizzie the best, this is a minor point of contention.  Mr. Bennet (Moray Watson) is still long suffering, Mrs. Bennet (Priscilla Morgan) is insufferable, and I still want to shake some sense into Lydia (Natalie Ogle) from the moment she first appears.  As soon as I recognized Judy Parfitt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh I knew that was a spot-on casting.  I especially liked Tessa Peake-Jones as Mary Bennet and Irene Richard as Charlotte Lucas, which made up for finding Malcolm Rennie's Mr. Collins too much the buffoon.  Director Cyril Coke filmed on location in the beautiful English countryside and certainly focuses on capturing all of the nuances of 18th century life among the gentry.

The strength of the production is its overall fidelity to Austen's novel, although I was a bit worried at first when screenwriter Fay Weldon took the novel's famous opening line, split it between Jane and Lizzie, and starting to work in the rest of the opening exposition as dialogue.  But then Mrs. Bennet bursts in and we are clearly on track.  All things considered this is the most restrained version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" that I have seen to date, wherein Mr. Bennet and his two eldest daughters most closely match the Bingleys and Darcys of this world in terms of calm restraint.  I really like the 2005 theatrical version of the story because it is crystal clear to me when Darcy falls for Elizabeth and when she falls for him, and I have to say that in this BBC production you really have to wait to hear the words come out of their mouths and then you are not particularly inclined to believe either one of them.  Still, so much of the familiar dialogue Austen wrote made it into this one that it is worth sitting through the entire 265 minutes of the five-part mini-series at least once if you are an Austen fan.  Final Note: This is the version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" that is included in the BBC's ""Jane Austen Collection"" of DVDs, which is how I finally got to check it out (and as soon as it was over my oldest daughter and I went to the theater to watch the Keira Knightley version again).",1136246400,6,3618,4.586046511627907
300060,5,6300248569,"This version of Pride and Prejudice may very well be my favorite.  I can say that after recently seeing the 2005 version with Keira Knightly and the 1996 version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.

This version of Pride and Prejudice is very unrated.  And to think that I almost did not buy it simply because I did not like the picture on the cover of the DVD.  All of the actors are good and the actress who played Elizabeth Bennett is simply beautiful.

This version is quite different from the others, so you don't feel that you are just watching the same movie with different actors.  But the reason why I like it the most is that it develops the later half of the story more.  For P & P fans, this  translates into more romance.

Don't let the fact that it was made in 1980 bother you.  The actors are dressed in costume for the time period, so it does not seem that old.",1135728000,15,877,4.228915662650603
300061,2,6300248569,"I have to say that I'm puzzled by the overwhelming support of this adaptation of Jane Austen's book in the face of more recent--and in my opinion, better--adaptations.  Having seen all versions of P&P that I could legally get my hands on, and being a huge fan of the book and its author, I found this version of the story flat and uninteresting...and, dare I say, boring.

David Rintoul had the makings to be an excellent Darcy, but in the end, his performance is a disappointment.  If there is any character development happening here, I must have missed it.  Rintoul struts around the film with a ramrod-straight back and absolutely no emotion or sensitivity; if I had not read the book I would have wondered how Elizabeth possibly managed to fall in love with him.  Granted, Austen focuses very little on the emotions of her heros, but this detachment does not transfer well to screen -- whether Austen addresses it or not, the character of Darcy must change from the first proposal to the second, and this is something the production team of the '95 BBC adaptation understood.  Whether direction was at fault in this production, or simply Rintoul's personal interpretation of the role, this is a very unsatisfying portrayal.

Elizabeth Garvie gives a good effort, but she simply does not have the wit and vivacity of Ehle's Elizabeth.  Again, as with Rintoul, there was much potential here.  In combination with Rintoul's Darcy, this insipid portrayal points to a lack of vision on the production team, more specifically the direction.  I get the feeling that both of these actors had much to give if they had been allowed to give it.  The overall production tries to stick as closely as possible to Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but in the obsession with details, it loses the overall feel and tone of the book.  ""Couldn't see the forest for the trees"" has relevancy here.

If you'd like to see a truly good adaptation of the novel, go for the 1995 production, also done by the BBC.  True, it's everyone's favorite, but that's for a reason.",1135555200,11,2045,4.756373937677054

She is exactly how I pictured what Elizabeth Bennet would look and act like when I read the book many years before I first saw this version last year.

Moments that I find tremendously moving and thrilling in the 1996 version pass without the least involvement in this version.

The direction is static and stolid. Performances are tepid compared with the spirited portrayals in the 1996 version. Casting is everything and again the 1996 cast is vivid at every level.  The director really let his 1980's cast down.

This is not a novel.  It's a dramatatisation of a novel, a visual retelling of a complex story in only a few hours.  You can't depend on Jane Austen to make the movie as successful as the novel.

300065,5,6300248569,"As P&P book fan I decided to purchase all available adaptations and as I have read so many positive reviews here at the amazon.co.uk website to raise my curiosity I bought the '80 BBC version.

First of all let me tell you that watching the film was pure delight. Fay Weldon's script stayed faithful to the book without destroying the excitement or lessening its pleasures. I especially liked the end which was too short and precipitate in the '95 version: there you had no time to enjoy the part before Elizabeth & Darcy actually profess their love for each other, here it was more detailed and leisurely, which I found very positive. To my disappointment in the '95 version there was no scene with Mrs Bennet rejoicing over Lizzy's engagement which is of course much more fun than Mr Bennet expressing his concerns and doubts. Here the excellent Priscilla Morgan was given the chance and I liked it very much.

The actors were all excellent. Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennet both physically and spiritually. Her sparkling eyes expressed all her emotions, her wit, playfulness and intelligence - just as Jane Austen described her. I actually liked Jennifer Ehle's performance up to now, but compared to Garvie she fades away and I actually discovered that she SMIRKS instead of smiling playfully or even mischievously. Garvie could act playfully and even challengingly without being impertinent or impolite: J Ehle simply couldn't.

David Rintoul was also excellent, although I admit that I prefer Colin Firth's Darcy, but I found him a bit too rigid and aloof for a while. I know, I know, Darcy IS rigid and aloof, but I couldn't spot any difference in his behaviour towards strangers and his friends the Bingleys: he didn't looked relaxed for a second even in their company. However when I saw his ""almost smile"" in his eyes and on his lips he started to grow on me gradually. I still thought his acting monotonous occasionally, but I learned to like him.

I also liked Barbara Shelley and Michael Lees as Mr & Mrs Gardiner: they were truly genteel and sensible, once again what Jane Austen might have in mind. Priscilla Morgan as Mrs Bennet and Malcolm Rennie (Mr Collins) looked and acted their part tremendously.

This version is more like it was adapted to the stage (the other is a true movie adaptation, more dynamic) but after getting used to its pace I did not mind it at all.

Clearly, this version did not have the budget the other did, but it did not spoil neither costume, nor scenery nor the lovely music.

This is a must see adaptation for all Austen and P&P fans.",1128384000,19,2585,4.731111111111111

Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy came across, to me, as embarrassingly wimpy. Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth seemed abrasive. The other characters were reduced to caricatures. The modernized, abridged dialogue and the addition of scenes not in the book only made the whole movie seem like a forgettable 20th-century soap opera not particularly well acted and inexplicably featuring early 19th-century clothes.

By contrast, in this version, David Rintoul captures Darcy so perfectly, a mixture of arrogance, pride, sexual charisma, and under the surface, something more. When my sisters and I watched this movie on TV back in the '80s, we were so taken with him that we read the novel! And Elizabeth Garvie portrays Elizabeth Bennet so faithfully, it's hard to imagine anyone outdoing her. The sparks between her and Rintoul are palpable. And each of the other characters is so well acted, with dialogue so well adapted from the novel, that you can watch this video over and over again and notice something different each time. The whole production sparkles!

However, in fairness, I have to say that the BBC version is very like the book in unfolding slowly (at first) and having a lot of dialogue. If you prefer a story that moves at a uniformly fast pace with less dialogue, you may prefer the A&E version. Otherwise, this is the P&P movie to see!",1127088000,12,1511,4.94488188976378

300082,3,6300248569,"In my opinion, there are only two adaptations of P&P worth watching: this one and the 1995 miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. The other ones suffer from shortness. The essence of P&P is not the love story; it is the portraying of a society and its manners and virtues, and you cannot do the book justice in a two hours movie. Thus, I will consider only these two versions in my review.

The 1980 version is, in a way, truer to the book. It changes only some minor details and does not add anything that is not in the book - the 1995 version adds three scenes at least, with the intention of better explaining the character of Darcy to a modern audience.

In fact, it has the air more of a theater play than of a movie, in the style of all BBC series of the time. Darcy is just as handsome and stiff as in the book, Lizzy just as witty. Many dialogues are exactly as in the book, and some narrative passages are included by way of characters meditating.

But most of the other charaters just don't match. Mr. Bingley is very, very dull and in no way does justice to the book character, which was funny and engaging. Mr. Bennett was another big disappointment, he always seems so unhappy and serious, when in fact he is a man who assumes and accepts his own decisions and mistakes and tries to make the best of them. Wickham shows his true colors in his face and manner right from the beginning, he looks just the scoundrel he is, is is hard to imagine how a sensible girl like Lizzy did not see right through him. He, and especially Lydia, are not expanded well enough, thus their elopement comes out of thin air.

The only exception were the Gardiners, who look just as in the book.

Lady Catherine will come as a shock to those of you used to the 1995 version, because she is a very different person. Where the 1995 one was perpetually bored and in slow motion, and old, the 1980 one is younger, agile and sparkling. Both interpretations are equally valid, I guess, I cannot decide which one I like best.

As to Darcy and Lizzy: I know Jane Austen never said that Lizzy was beautiful, just that she had very ""fine eyes"", but I always felt that she was the kind of person who more than made up for that by her wits and spirit. Lizzy was passionate, and in this movie she is not. (In the discussion with Lady Catherine, she doesn't lose her temper even once.) She acts very well rehearsed lines, but does not get into the character. Or perhaps she just isn't Lizzy as I have pictured it. She and Darcy have no chemistry at all. Chemistry might be a modern concept for the XIXth century, but still, you would like your hero and heroine to look like they belong together, and these two do not. That is even more true for Jane and Bingley, which look like they belong in different movies.

My opinion may be biased because when I first watched this mini series, I had already watched the 1995 version at least 5 times, and to my mind, the characters, dialogues, places and events were well fixed. To me, it was like walking into a familiar house and finding all things just slightly out of place. I felt the impulse to go and put everything back like it was.

The second version is the least known, which is too bad, because it's definitely the best of the three.

I was delighted when at long last they put the BBC version on DVD.  It was previously available as a two-set VHS, but with many scenes cut out of the original as it was presented on Masterpiece Theater.  The DVD restores the original in five parts.  If this does break up the continuity a bit, it also lets you watch it in increments if you don't want to view it all at once (at 4 and a half hours, it's a lengthy film), without missing anything.

Most people who watched the A&E version of the book were drawn by the casting of Colin Firth in the role of Darcy. Let me say with some trepidation, lest I get jumped en masse and drawn and quartered by Firth groupies, that I thought he was miscast in that role. The BBC version had no big names, but the casting was almost perfect. Greer Garson in the role of Elizabeth Bennett in the Hollywood movie was ridiculous, a 36 year old actress playing a 20 year old ingenue; she should have been cast as Elizabeth's mother.  Jennifer Ehle in the role of Elizabeth in the A&E film was excellent. But whereas Ehle did a very fine job playing Elizabeth Bennet, Elizabeth Garvie, in the BBC version, WAS Elizabeth Bennet.

Of all the three films made of the book, The BBC version stays closest to the book by far. The Hollywood film turned the book inside out until one almost couldn't tell what book the film was based on, and the A&E version, although it adhered fairly close to the book, took the liberty of rewriting some of Austen's famous lines. One does not rewrite Austen. Period.

The cast of the BBC version is superb. Elizabeth Garvie is so much Elizabeth Bennet that she could have been invented for the part. She brings out all the character's lively intelligence, impulsiveness and spirit. She even looks like Elizabeth Bennet as Austen describes her, with her petite, slender frame and her enormous dark eyes. She brings the part so much to life that we imagine we are seeing her just as Austen meant her to be.

David Rintoul as Darcy aroused some criticism among some viewers who complained that his portrayal of Darcy is ""wooden"". Well, let's face it, Darcy was wooden in the book. Did Darcy ever crack a smile except in the last two chapters? Firth wanted to create his own conception of Darcy; sensitive, vulnerable, very much a 90's Darcy. He did a convincing job of it; the only problem is, Firth's Darcy isn't Austen's Darcy. Darcy jumping into a lake?  Please.  Rintoul portrays Darcy just as Austen wrote him, and he certainly looks the part -- tall, dark, stunningly handsome, very much the rich arrogant snob asking for a comeuppance. The interplay between Garvie and Rintoul is delightful, much more so than Ehle and Firth. Garvie and Rintoul are more of a contrast, as Austen meant them to be; her sparkling wit and vivacity is set off by his steadiness and gravity. Two of the best scenes in the film are when Elizabeth refuses Darcy's proposal, and when they run into each other at Pemberley. When Elizabeth tells Darcy he's the last man in the world she could ever be prevailed on to marry, her eyes flash enough sparks to set him on fire. And at their meeting at Pemberley, their mutual confusion and embarrassment, as portrayed by Garvie and Rintoul, is priceless to behold.

The other cast members look and act just as we picture them while reading the book. Mr. Bennet is a benevolent, impatient authority figure, his contempt for his wife's stupidity abundant in every line. Mrs. Bennet is a ditzy airhead, concerned only with gossip, the latest fashions, and marrying off her five daughters. The sisters all give competent performances but Sabina Franklyn is especially worth watching as the serenely beautiful Jane Bennet. The one disappointment was Lady Catherine DeBourgh. I had pictured her as a heavy-set Gorgon of a woman, and here she appears as a dried-up shrew, although she's evil enough. But Mr. Collins is dead-on perfect; a hilarious mixture of pomposity and servility. My favorite character of all in this production is Elizabeth's Aunt Gardiner as played by Barbara Shelley; her calm reassurance and common sense are exactly what Elizabeth needs to support her under her own confused feelings about Darcy, and when she is faced with the family crisis caused by Lydia's elopement with Wickham.

Ably directed by Cyril Coke, this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the one to watch. It's truest to the book and the characters are as Austen wrote them. It's the definitive Austen movie.",1122681600,40,4851,4.686251468860164
300100,5,6300248569,"This 1979 BBC production of  ""Pride and Prejudice,"" based on a classic novel by Jane Austen, about the morals, mores, marriages and the class system in Georgian England, is superb! The casting is perfect, with one exception. Although David Rintoul delivers a good performance as the proud Fitzwilliam Darcy, I am one of those Colin Firth fans who can imagine no other in the role. Please don't hold it against me. I admit to my own prejudice! Directed by Cyril Coke (known for his other Masterpiece Theater work including ""Upstairs, Downstairs""), the script was written by novelist Fay Weldon, who perfectly translates the novel's witty dialogue to the screen. This adaptation includes some original scenes, as does the A&E version. Here, Lizzy converses with her Aunt Gardiner on the subject of Mr. Wickham. She admits there's a possibility he is a scoundrel and promises not to be taken in by him. There's also the scene concerning Mr. Collin's ""Aquatic Life Hat"". And Malcolm Rennie's portrayal of Mr. Collins is terrific. It is obvious that this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" had a more limited budget than did the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. While the latter film is set in England's luxurious estates and country homes, this one uses television settings. Shown in the US on Masterpiece Theater in 1980, the movie was released in DVD format in an uninterrupted 225 minute 2 disc set, which has been digitally remastered.

The film clearly reflects Ms. Austin's theories on the importance of marriage for women of the period. Most women were not educated, except for the social graces; acquiring, at least, some proficiency in music, needlework and ""acceptable"" literature, and learning skills essential to running a household. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry well, to obtain financial security and social position, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare.

The film opens in a small community in Hertfordshire, England. Word is out that the empty Netherfield estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage, and, of course, gossiping. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well and settled, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also. Marriage is a serious business in this period.

There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, (Osmond Bullock), the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, (Sabina Franklyn), the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett (Ms. Garvie), the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy, (Rintoul). Darcy, is much wealthier than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene and looks down his nose at the local gentry. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She has a strong intellect and her father had encouraged her to become literate, and to enjoy fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, spirited, with a sharp wit, more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.

Elizabeth and Darcy's strong mutual attraction, and the conflict between them, which prevents them from forming a potentially rich relationship, provide an interesting tension throughout the film. Darcy's proud arrogance in his social class and position, and Elizabeth's prejudice against such haughtiness, seem to inhibit all promise of romance.

Ms. Austin's delightful characters, are brilliantly cast here, including: George Wickham, (Peter Settelen), a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, (Rennie), a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennetts, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, (Irene RIchard), a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, (A superb Judy Parfitt), the quintessential aristocrat. Elizabeth Garvie is a superb Lizzy Bennett. She sparkles with wit and intelligence, and is just beautiful enough to be believable. As I mentioned above, David Rintoul is a believable Darcy, but my personal preference is clear.

The settings and costumes are accurate to the period. The dialogue is faithful to the novel. Watching the film, it is almost impossible not to feel transported back in time, and become very involved with the loves, foibles, problems, and adventures of the wonderful Austin characters, brought so realistically to life, in this amazing production.

Unlike other reviewers, I think both A&E and BBC productions are excellent and find many aspects that I like in both. I own both DVDs and watch them frequently. I'm a fan!! A 5 Star BRAVO!

300101,5,6300248569,"Depending on the temperament of the viewer, this version of Pride & Prejudice will either be perfect or somewhat slow and drawn out. Since I can only judge it based on my own character, I give it 5 stars.

Like other similar BBC adaptations, this miniseries takes its time and explores the dialog and thought processes of the characters and clearly establishes the social conventions of the time and how they influenced the behavior of the characters. In the case of Pride and Prejudice, this is extremely important for the viewer to understand since Mr. Darcy's motivations are rooted in those conventions initially. In fact, the A & E miniseries (which is so often compared to other versions) didn't seem to make this quite as clear as this version.

Each of the characters is adequately fleshed out and the relationships slowly developed. The production values are on par with other similar BBC series (such as Jane Eyre) but one doesn't watch these for their lavish eye candy. It's much more like watching a play in 5 installments.

If you need a brisk pace in whatever you view and obvious romantic overtures displayed onscreen, you probably won't enjoy this adaptation. If you like to see a story slowly unfold and develop an atsmosphere and are satisfied with subtle romance, you will likely enjoy this very much.",1120867200,5,1320,4.857777777777778

But this is so dull, it becomes a struggle to sit through. It is like watching a stage play with exaggerated character reactions. Little seems to flow naturally. The dancing was stiff. The scenery was confined to a few look-alike parlors.

The emotion in the A&E version carried me away, while this one left me yawning.",1120003200,7,597,4.570093457943925

300104,4,6300248569,"This is in almost every way better than the A & E version. It is much more truer to the spirit of the novel, it feels like you have jumped into a time machine and gone back to regency England. The actors are all superb, even the minor characters are well rounded. It has none of the `over the top' acting you got in the 1995 version. A few that stand out include the absolutely gorgeous Elizabeth Garvie, whose portrayal of Elizabeth is exquisite, none of the petulant smirking we got from Jennifer Ehle. She portrays Eliza as the intelligent and lively character that Austen intended. You can see why Darcy is attracted to her (I certainly was), I feel that the 1995 version failed to establish this. David Rintoul is superb as Mr. Darcy chiefly because he looks like him (I am sorry Colin), he is stiff, proud and arrogant just like in the novel. You can see why Elizabeth dislikes him, witness some of his exchanges with Elizabeth at Netherfield and Rosings, the underlying tension, absolutely superb. One of my problems with Firth's Darcy is one that other reviewers have already alluded to - he is too likeable. There seems very little reason for Elizabeth to dislike him, in fact she is far more disagreable than he is. My one gripe with Rintoul is that I was not totally convinced with his change in manners when they meet at Pemberley, he is still too stiff. Firth was excellent in his portrayal of the `reformed' Darcy. Charlotte and Mr. Collins are also well acted, she is sensible, realistic and still a great friend to Eliza not the snob that she was portrayed in 1995. Mr. Collins is a believable character not the caricature of 1995 version , he is still pompous and annoying, but you can see what makes him tick. Mr. & Mrs. Bennett are well portrayed, the Bennett sisters look alike as do the Bingley sisters.

My one major complaint with this version is that it meddles with the ending as was the case with 1995 version. I've never understood why directors/script-writers constantly interfere with what is a classic ending. Both versions seem to have been rushed as if the production teams realised that time was short and wrapped it up in a hurry. There are also some minor changes in the dialogue, but nothing too alarming as was the case with the 1995 version. Jane Austen's dialogue is the highlight of all her books, why would you change it? Then again I suppose that is why I am writing this review and not having my scripts filmed in Hollywood.

I enjoyed this immensely. Others have pointed to the budget limitations, but I for the life of me do not see how this has any relevance. This is a period piece not an action spectacular. A higher budget would just encourage directors to meddle with what is a great book in an attempt to justify expenditure (any one who has caught a glimpse of the 2005 P & P big screen version will know what I mean).

My best advice is to buy both versions and you'll not be disappointed. The earlier version is truer to the book, while the latter does the romance better.",1119398400,9,3026,4.518248175182482
300105,2,6300248569,"There's tendency for reviewers here to compare this miniseries version (the 1980 BBC one) of Jane Austen's classic novel with the 1995 A&E miniseries of the same. (Actually, the A&E version was coproduced with the BBC, but for simplicity's sake everybody ignores that. BBC, by the way, has a long history of periodically dramatizing *Pride and Prejudice*, but only these two most recent versions are available on DVD.) If both versions were roughly equally wonderful, one could then recommend both. But, alas, one is as close to a masterpiece as dramatic television ever gets, while the other adds nothing to the original novel -- and begs why but for laziness any viewer should watch it when that viewer could be profitably reading or rereading the novel.

This 1980 BBC version is defended because it's truer to plot and characterization details of the novel. What such defenders don't seem to appreciate is that narrative fiction and film are very different art forms, and that the successful adaptation of ideas from one to another is very much a creative undertaking. Dramatized unimaginatively, Austen's lively character studies and sly comedy of manners become a bloodless soap opera.

Beyond suffering from a much inferior script, this version -- as opposed to its A&E successor -- must've suffered from a paltry budget, which adversely affected all aspects of the production. The cameras are videotape, not the true-to-life film of A&E. The cinematography is static, not animated. The actors are mediocre, not talented. The performances are underrehearsed, not polished. The editing is abrupt, not inviting.

Conversely, the A&E version richly fleshes out the novel, and has a life of its own. Yes, it takes some liberties with the novel -- because the built-in narrative of a novel can explain things that must be presented as action in a teleplay. If you want the novel, read the novel: one of the very best ever written. If you want to see an almost sublimely marvelous television miniseries which happens to be adapted from that novel, get -- own, because you'll want to see it again and again -- the A&E.

This BBC miniseries is a waste of time to watch not because it's awful, but because it's superfluously mediocre. It's not bad so much as not worthwhile -- not while the original novel and the A&E miniseries beckon. Your time can be so better spent.",1119225600,10,2368,4.9571788413098234
300106,3,6300248569,"After having obsessed over first the book, and then the A&E adaptation (all within a week), I have now seen the BBC's adaptation from the 1980s.  I have to say I think it pales in comparison to the famous A&E version.  I do agree that this version (the BBC version) is true to much of Jane Austen's dialogue and is probably more authentic to the period with the stiff, emotionless acting... but it's just entirely too dull.  I LOVE Austen's words, but why watch a 4 hour reading of her words with very little acting or emotion?  The A&E version may be a little more ""Hollywood"", but I think it brings to the screen all the emotions and depth read on Austen's pages, which this BBC version is completely incapable of.  The actors are stiff and lifeless.  As I said, that may be more true to the decorum of the time period, but completely unentertaining in film.

It's worth noting that the A&E version is also true to much of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice.  It's just that, in contrast to this lifeless version, the A&E adaptation is much more vibrant and emotional - an adaptation I think Jane Austen would have enjoyed :)",1114387200,9,1124,4.4754901960784315

Who are those actors? Most of them, especially young ones, seems like have no acting training at all. They all say their line in a fast, monotone voice. And what's with this Darcy guy? Even when he is speaking, not an inch of his face moves. And did he have neck injury? When he turns his head, he always turns his whole upper body.

Besides the aweful acting, the directing, editing and everything else are no good either. In the end, it's a total waste of 4 hours and totally put me off the idea of reading the book and writing the report. I did on Oliver Twist instead.",1114041600,10,846,4.184049079754601

This 1980 adaptation of pride and prejudice is the worst adaptation of any book I have ever seen. I've seen other book adaptation in the 80's and I've enjoyed most of them but this one just bored me to death. Everyone was acting in slow motion as if they were on stage. Correct me if I'm wrong but Pride and Prejudice was supposed to be a sparkling comedy but there is nothing sparkling in this adaptation. It was like a book reading without any feelings at all, I waited until the end to see if there is something that could redeem the film but it got worst. There is no comparison to the other PnP adaptation starring Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle. That one is much more superior than any other book adaptation I have seen so far. I don't think that it has anything to do with the budget or the extra one hour that, the performance of the whole cast was just much better than the ones in the 80s and even the supporting characters are better. I was inspired to read the book when i saw the 1995 PnP but the 1980 version did not impress me at all. It is close to the book sure because the characters just read the book during the entire film but the spirit was lost. The 1995 version was not only close to the book but it also captured the spirit of Jane Austen's most beloved novel.",1111708800,14,1425,4.204379562043796

300130,5,6300248569,"Firstly I'd like to say that some seem to be under the misaprehension that the Colin Firth version was made by A&E, that is not so they only provided money, it was made like this earlier version by the BBC and shown in six weekly installments. I do come from London by the way.

Now to this the 1980 version which I've watched again today, for about the millionth time. Both versions are good but this is definitely the one I prefer, I think every actor performs better even Darcy. Although Colin Firth is more attractive, Darcy is written as proud and arrogant and that's exactly how David Rintoul played him, yes he was stiff, but that's how he was written. Elizabeth Garvie is fabulous as Eliza, just as I imagine her to be bright, intelligent with a wonderful sense of irony. I never enjoyed Jennifer Ehle's performance and I thought she was too curvacious to be Lizzie, who I'd always thought of as petite.

Alison Steadman's OTT portrayal of Mrs Bennet in the 1995 version was appalling, and I usually admire her as an actress, Priscilla Morgan got it just right, silly but not a caricature performance.

True if one wants a Romance Movie you would go for the 1995 version because of all the additional scenes that are not in the book, as lovely it was to see Darcy swimming I don't know where they dragged it up from, certainly not from Miss Austen. Also they definitely expanded Miss Darcy's part from what was written in the book, and as wonderful as my favourite scene from the later version of Elizabeth playing the piano at Pemberley and then assisting Georgiana was, it didn't happen!

This version that was produced by Fay Weldon was filmed as a TV show, hence there was not the cinema quality of the later version which was filmed as a movie. I personally don't think that detracts at all, I loved Elizabeth's thoughts being spoken and the smaller set gave it a book like feel.

I do agree the ending was abrupt, I was disappointed, actually I've been disappointed with all the endings, I would love to see a version where Lizzie and Darcy are writing their various letters to their relations telling them of their upcoming marriage as in the book, but you can't have everything I guess.",1109462400,5,2202,4.564556962025317

300132,2,6300248569,"So rarely do I disagree with the majority of Amazon reviewers that I watched this movie twice, so as to be sure I felt the same way after viewing it again.

While it is true that the script follows the dialogue of the novel more closely than does the later production, I cannot see how it is more true to the book. I feel it fails in some of the most interesting aspects of the book in that it doesn't capture the comedy and is far from being light, bright and sparkeling as JA herself described the story. Tongue in cheek she mentions in a letter that it 'wants more shade'. It seems to me that the actors and director introduced a bit too much shade.

I respect Fay Weldon but take issue with the way she wrote the script to have the actors repeat what is actually narration in the book. This makes for very uncomfortable and heavy dialogue, which the actors are incapable of carrying off. Further, their acting is very wooden, and I do not find Rintoul in the least handsome except in profile, and while Elizabeth Garvie is a pretty girl, the actress who played Jane has the beautiful eyes that should be necessary in the actress who plays Lizzie's part.

I found myself not caring in the least if Darcy and Lizzie or Jane and Mr. Bingley finally get together as there was no chemistry between those actors at all.  The actresses who played Lydia and Kitty were much too old for the part, as was the actress who played Mrs. Bennet. After all, Jane is but almost 23 and her mother surely would not have been more than 43 and was a beauty in her day.  Overall I felt almost the entire core cast was actually mis-cast.  Every single actor is entirely forgettable.

The music was reminsiscent of an old BBC soap opera.

I gave this movie 2 stars because the sets and costuming were spot on and is leaps and bounds better than the worst P&P production of all time - that horrible 1940's Greer Garson movie where they are wearing Victorian, instead of Georgian/Regency clothing.

I don't find the Ehle and Firth production in the least dumbed down and far prefer it.  In fact, that production has been more instrumental in bringing the works of Jane Austen to the 20th and 21st centuries than any other because it includes all the major elements, though perhaps not all the dialogue of the book. It captured the spirit of the book

300134,5,6300248569,"I encountered this BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice in the early 1980s when it first aired on PBS and was immediately enchanted by its beauty. The A&E release from the 90s, while not without its merits, just couldn't compare.

The A&E's version does seem to do a better job in introducing this classic by catering to the taste of the contemporary audience, while this 1980s version seems more faithful in attempting to reconstruct the Regency world so masterfully depicted by Austen. The leisurely-paced story-telling here will require patience, but that patience is amply rewarded by the richness of portrayal from a superbly talented cast. At the risk of repeating many thoughtful and perceptive comments here, I just want to say that the casting director deserves huge kudos: Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennett! The direction, a source of complaints for some, does seem to rely on techniques of television than film. You will see extreme close-ups of characters--including many nuanced expressions of these fine actors. To me, this is a plus.

Contrary to some reviewers' complaints on the low production values, I actually love the spare setting of homes. The interior lighting is deftly handled--a warm yellow-orange palette glows in daylight scenes and enhances the sense of domestic intimacy. I'm no expert in Regency music, but I love the scoring of the entire series, from the theme song to every scrap of melodies played over to complement the scenes or as interludes. The small chamber ensemble style, led by woodwind instruments, is in harmony with other aspects of production details. A fully-orchestrated technique, while rich-sounding, would have been totally off the mark. In short, this is an adaptation to treasure!

Now, if only BBC would release the VHS/DVD version of its equally superb 1970s adaptation of Jane Eyre, starring the incomparable pairing of Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston! Sigh.",1104969600,13,1924,5.2200647249190935
300135,5,6300248569,"This production is more faithful to the book by Jane Austen than the others, both in character and plot.  It's also more comical and lighthearted than the other versions, but that's because it doesn't present any character as a cartoon or caricature (e.g., compare Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins here to their 1995 miniseries counterparts).  A caricature, to me, is like a lump of lead: throw it in water and it sinks.

 I find the relationships between the characters develop naturally.  The plain settings allow this development to come forth, like really good theatre.  Our reward is that we see the characters interacting in a world that has particular conventions.  Some of these conventions are difficult to explain to today's audiences, who get off on movies...like ""Titanic.""  Certainly, Fay Weldon crafted a couple of new scenes and there are some minor logical errors, but she's kept the dialogue, aired it out with discretion without twisting it.  Today's audiences tend to expect actors to show a good deal of emotion.  I think that Darcy's ""stiffness,"" as portrayed by David Rintoul, is right on key.  It's a function both of his pride and social standing, and makes for positive change as the series progresses.

Elizabeth Garvie is very beautiful to look at as Elizabeth, but what sets her above other actresses in the role is her intelligence and curiosity about the world.  Her eyes are beautiful because they are open.  She is prejudiced against Darcy because he sleights her, he has contrived to separate Jane from Bingley, and is dislikeable, not because, for example, she is smugly superior to a likeable man.  Her discoveries of what a scoundrel Wickham is, and of Darcy's actions on behalf of her sister's honor, lead her (and the audience) to change judgment.
Today's audiences tend to dislike her narration (but the book was originally narrated, no?) and to impose a modern standard of sex appeal.  (However, if there's a woman out there like
Garvie's Elizabeth, I'd certainly like to meet her...before I'm 35.)

The other actors get into the meat of their parts, but I'll only recognize a few here.  Barbara Shelley is a warm and attractive Aunt Gardiner, the aunt you wish you had to warn you against evil.  Moray Watson is Mr. Bennet, a man of intelligence who suffers a wife-become-frivolous, and has a close bond with Elizabeth, despite being hemmed in by silly daughters.  Judy Parfitt is a pompous and caustic Lady de Bourgh ripe for shaking by Elizabeth at the end.  Sabina Franklyn (Jane) is beautiful and straightforward: though acquaintances of mine find her not voluptuous enough, I don't think that's a problem.
The actress who plays Charlotte Lucas is plain, but not at all unhandsome and emphasizes the practicality of the character.

The thing about pre-circa-1985 BBC dramas is you can watch them and imagine grand settings around the basic integrity of the characters and plot, without having so many bucks and pounds poured in for eye candy, or to do the work of the imagination.  And that's what reading the book is about anyway, coming up with one's own pictures.

P.S.
To the reviewer who would like to see the 5-part Michael
Jayston and Sorcha Cusack ""Jane Eyre"" (1973) on DVD, I'll second that. The BBC hit a sweet spot in the 70s.  Any idea who owns the rights to distribute?  As the 1980 Pride and Prejudice went to DVD with stiff competition from the 1995 version, it doesn't seem impossible that Jayston/Cusack's ""Jane Eyre"" could go there too.",1104883200,12,3494,4.889643463497453

I liked this 1980 version because Fay Weldon's script retained so much of Austen's inner narrative, which forms the heart/soul of the novel.",1104278400,6,370,4.873015873015873
300137,5,6300248569,"Pride and Prejudice is my favourite book of all time by my favourite author, and I first saw this adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece when I was still at school.
It was originally shown as an episodic serial over several weeks on BBC2.
I first bought it as a complete work on VHS in ooh must have been the late 1980's, when it first became available, and I have watched it many times.
I also own and have watched the Andrew Davies adaptation from 1995 and the MGM movie made in 1940.
All these productions have their merits and in their way are beautifully done, but without any question this is the version most faithful to the book, in both content and style.
Elizabeth Garvie should have become a huge star as a result of this performance, but she has since chosen to work almost exclusively in the theatre, and David Rintoul is her perfect foil. His Darcy almost anal retentive in his stiff upper lippedness.
And how prophetic, now that he has sold Diana's private video's to the American media, that Peter Settelen should have made such a wonderfully slimy and sycophantic Wickham.
If ever a Wickham deserved a Lydia....his did.
I'm sure there will be those who find the tempo of the piece somewhat pedestrian, but that was the nature of the beast in 19th century England.
The 1995 version, [oh and for the record may I clear up a misconception that some people seem to be under. The 1995 version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, was and is a BBC production. It may have been released under license in the USA by A&E, but it is NOT and never was an A&E production.]
...anyway..
The 1995 version was much faster paced, and the smouldering relationship between Lizzy and Darcy intensely exciting for the viewer to watch, however, many of the nuances of the piece are far too modern to represent a truly faithful adaptation.
For example, if Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship had indeed been as toe curlingly sexy as portrayed, Elizabeth's shock and dismay at Darcy's proposal would have been ingenuous to say the least.
I also take issue with the portrayal of: Mrs Bennett, who though undoubtedly ditsy was never a common vulgar fishwife, and a far too old and far too buxom Lydia.
And whilst much more accurate than the 1940 movie version, this production was not also entirely faithful to the original text Add to this the excruciating performances of Alison Steadman and Julia Sawalha, both fine actresses, who on this occasion were just horribly miscast, and the 1980 version is a clear favourite for those of us who don't like their Austen tinkered with too much.",1103068800,12,2582,4.68942731277533
300138,5,6300248569,"I have longed for this to be available on DVD and was afraid that the A & E version would preclude this re-release. Happily, given the bargain rate, Austen fans can enjoy both versions. While I must say I adore Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, I really prefer the rest of this cast to that of the A & E editon. Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennett to me; the other actress playing EB was too ""modern."" (In fact, she reminded me of a flapper that landed in the wrong period piece; too much smirking and not enough wit for Our Miss Bennett.) And Lady Catherine deBurghe--this actress really makes her terribly believable (and therefore, Eliza much more courageous for standing up to her), whereas in the A & E version she's a frail old lady one feels rather sorry for (and therefore Eliza gains no points for taking her down a peg or two). I wish we had a computer technology to put this cast into the lush historic settings of the A & E version, but barring that, buy both!",1100131200,10,966,4.342541436464089

Yes, I saw this version well before the A&E version and watched it regularly since it came out on VHS. Thank goodness for this dvd because my videotape is about to wear out!  I just think this version feels closer to the book somehow. There are no tight bodices or a wet shirt Mr. Darcy, but it is enjoyable and engaging all the same. I love Elizabeth Garvie as Lizzy Bennet. She just completely captures the spirit of Elizabeth Bennet for me: playful, pretty, charming, witty and engaging, and with those lovely big brown eyes. David Rintoul is a handsome, aristocratic Darcy and all the actors are perfectly cast. I must say I always had a problem with the casting of Jane Bennet (not pretty enough), the Bingley sisters (no resemblance) and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner (not elegant at all) in the 1995 version, but not so here. Jane is perfectly amiable and lovely in the guise of Sabina Franklin and the Gardiners are elegant and well-bred as they should be. The actresses who play Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley also do look like sisters.  There is also no over-the-top acting which sometimes overshadowed other actors/characters.

The only downside of this version is, of course, that the budget was less than its 1995 counterpart and so most of the filming took place on sets instead of on the real thing. The costumes and locations are simpler.  However, the actors and story treatment more than make up for its shortcomings and this version is a must have for any Jane Austen fan's movie library.  If you've only seen the 1995 version and a true Jane Austen fan, be sure to check this one out.  It is a gem that deserves to be seen!",1099612800,19,1770,4.564668769716088

I remember seeing it when it was aired on Masterpiece Theater over a five week period. It instantly become my favorite British presentation, apart from ""Flambards"".

I have also seen the 1996 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I liked the version very much. Colin did an excellent portrayal of Mr. Darcy and Jennifer was a lovely Elizabeth, but I never forget this earlier version. I kept picturing Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul when I watched the newer P&P and realized, they will always be Elizabeth and Darcy to me.

This older version perfectly captured the overall feel of the novel. True, Rintoul's performance was stiff compared to Colin Firth's, but I honestly feel he really showed the proud and arrogant Mr. Darcy of Jane Austen's story. Sorry, but Colin Firth was just too likable. Elizabeth Garvie was dead on as Elizabeth. She was exactly how I pictured Elizabeth to be. Jennifer Ehle seemed too cheerful at times and was missing some of the archiness and wit that Garvie displayed.

My favorite scene in this version was when Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at Pemberly. It was word for word from the book,  with every embarrassed look and uneasy feeling captured. The newer version I would said followed the story line more. There were several scenes in this older version that were condensed, such as when Elizabeth visits Charlotte in Hunsford. And the newer version adds scenes which I thought was unneccessary.

I have a hard time choosing between the two version since both were wonderful in their own special way. But if I had to choose, then this 1979 version would be number one with the 1996, a very, very close second.  The main reason being whenever I think of Mr. Darcy, I see David Rintoul!",1095638400,16,1891,4.75

This version seems to have more depth than the 1996 remake and I suspect this is because it was produced more like a theatrical play rather than a film.  Also, I think it may contain more dialogue from the book(?).  It didn't have as big a budget as the 1996 remake but nevertheless the scenery, costumes and locations are lovely.  Elizabeth Garvie is wonderful as Elizabeth Bennet.  She has a beautiful voice and some of her facial expressions are funny.  Although I thought Jennifer Ehle was good in the 1996 version, she smiles too much which annoyed me after a while.  I am also one of the few who prefer David Rintoul over Colin Firth as Darcy.  I thought Colin Firth brought too much emotion to the part of Darcy.  He seemed, at times, to appear vulnerable and that's not how Darcy appears.  I agree that Rintoul could have been less stiff but all in all I think there is great chemistry between him and Garvie.  The scene where they bump into each other at Pemberly is wonderful.  Astonishment, confusion, embarrassment, kindness, are wonderfully acted out between them.  I like all of the other actors.  I don't find any character to be over-exaggerated.  In the 1996 remake, Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins were over the top.  So I recommend this.",1094256000,11,1314,4.603448275862069

Each has its charms but this one is my favorite.  Admittedly it is not as polished, but the casting is superb and the dialogue stays closer to the book both in content and in spirit.

 My love of Jane Austin's work and other classic literature began with watching this adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" on Masterpiece Theater in 1980.  It was an absolute treat. I remember waiting impatiently over the 5 weeks that it aired for each new episode.  Several years later when it came out on VHS I had to have it and was every bit as enchanted as I had been in my early teens.  I've since worn through two copies of the tapes and was getting ready to order a third when I stumbled across the DVD.  Needless to say, that's what I ordered to replace the tapes.

 I am absolutely delighted with the DVD.  I had gotten so familiar with the tapes that I was stunned when 'extra' scenes that I had forgotten about began to appear. This is the whole thing!  It has not been edited down like the VHS tapes.  I spent a very comfortable afternoon getting re-acquainted with this old favorite.  I whole-heartedly recommend it.  (Now if I could only get the 1983 version of ""Jane Eyre"" on DVD, I'd have nothing left to wish for.)",1093824000,,1423,4.4192307692307695

I have had bad experiences with such transfers, but was hoping that it would be at least viewable. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is bright and clear on DVD!

I came in by way of reading this story before I saw the video versions. Perhaps that explains why I prefer this version -- which has much more of the feel of the novel -- to the quite excellent version from the 1990's. The later version is a bit darker, but also, well, sexier with a touch of beefcake -- at least as much so as you are going to get in a tale of Miss Austen's -- but the light touch, the humor, and the superb casting of this older version still has my heart. If you are a high school student cheating by watching a video rather than reading the book -- shame on you! -- this is the one to watch. You are, by the way, depriving yourself of exposure to one of the finest stylists in English literature. And did you notice the price? This is a bargain!",1093651200,8,1089,4.136792452830188

This DVD release has (yes, finally!) brought the full 5-part story back, with a running time of 265 (4 hrs 25 min), just as it was aired on PBS (although Alistair is absent from the DVD, which is why it isn't a full 5 hrs).

However, it picks up after the first hour and I particularly like Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth and Priscilla Morgan as Mrs Bennet (Alison Steadman in the 1995 version is just ridiculous).

One thing I would like to mention is that both this version and the 1995 version are BBC productions. Both were co-productions, 1980 with the Australian Broadcasting Commission and 1995 with A&E, but essentially they were both made by the BBC.",1093046400,3,642,5.0
300158,3,6300248569,"In part because I saw the A&E version first this 1985 adaptation seemed far less exciting and much slower but it was worth watching because it has several scenes from the novel that were not in the A&E adaptation and the costuming and scenery were fabulous.  Personally, I thought the Elizabeth and Lydia characters were not as vibrant as they might have been.  Their personalities were not portrayed as strongly against each other as I would have prefered and the characters in the film were not as emotive as my imagination had Austin portraying them in the novel.  The women seemed like they were always smiling whether they were supposed to be angry, annoyed, whatever.  As far as the screen play was written, I would have preffered the characters ineractions and acting to portray their idiosyncracies rather than useing the dialogue to spell it out for me.

For instance, when Elizabeth explains to Wicham how Mr. Collins employment to DeBourg (spelling?) has turned him into a pompous, self-important man when it was already obvious.  And the writer also took extra pains to write in scenes showing how ridiculous and meddling Lady Catherine DeBourg is when I thought the actor did a fine enough job portraying this without manipulating my interpretation.  However, that aside, I thought the cast was perfect, I enjoyed Mr. Collins as a bumbling idiot and (forgive me Firth fans) I thought Darcy was fabulous and quite handsome.  I think I prefered this Lady Catherine DeBourg to  the A&E version but the confrontation between Lady Catherine and Lizzy was not as passionate as I had interpereted it in my mind while reading the book.",1092528000,2,1640,4.913043478260869

There are some downplayed moments that should be poignant, which instead just feel like dead air. Most importantly, the performances leave much to be desired, as the two main characters, Lizzy and Darcy, are barely brought to life by the respective actors. I have to admit, my favorite parts of the adaptation were those with Darcy, not because of his character, but because the actor had the uncanny ability to barely open his mouth when brusquely and dully dead-panning his lines.

Elizabeth, Jane, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett are all superb!  The note the movie ends on is just delicious.

300202,3,6300248569,"I bought this version because I love Pride and Prejudice and thought I would enjoy any version. I must have been spoiled by the 1995 A&E version, because this one seemed so amateur.

The actors were stiff, especially David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy.  ""A viewer from il"" described him well; acting as though he had a wedgie and couldn't wait for everyone to leave so he could pick it!  That really made me laugh because it is true.  He walked around as if he had a steel rod for a spine.  In one of my favorite P&P scenes, Darcy's proposal, both David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie recited their lines without expression. It was like they had practiced a thousand times, were tired of it, and were speaking fast to get it over with. In the 1995 version of this scene, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle both express emotion in their their voices and facial expressions; it is a wonderfully enjoyable scene. Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet seems quieter and more serious, whereas Ehle as Elizabeth is playful and has sparkling eyes.  Garvie's Elizabeth walks around with a prissy fringed parasol which looks like it came from Caroline Bingley's closet.

Several of the other characters were also better cast in the A&E version.  Susannah Harker was better as Jane because of her natural beauty and sweetness.  The Jane in this 1980 version looked like a 1980's beauty with her dark eyebrows and eyeliner.  In Jane Austen's time she would have been considered a painted woman.  David Bamber as Mr. Collins in the 95 A&E version was pompous and slimy, whereas the Mr. Collins in this 1980 version is just a big goof, even likable.  I definitely prefer the 1995 A&E version.  The casting in that one is near perfect, and expresses Jane Austen's novel so well.  If you love that version, you may not like this one.",1079049600,9,1792,4.647619047619048
300203,5,6300248569,"I've lost count of how many times I've read Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - it's one of my very favorite books. Comparing the two miniseries adaptations of it -- this one done in the 80s by BBC and the more recent one by A&E/BBC (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Special-Edition-A-E-1996/dp/B00005MP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)</a>) -- there are definite advantages to each. The one you choose depends on what you want. If you want a Hollywood-style romantic comedy, watch the A&E version. But if you want what is closest to Austen's novel (which I prefer, and enjoyed more), watch the older BBC version. The first time I tried to watch the newer version, I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because I kept saying, ""THAT didn't happen in the book"" over and over again and it was really frustrating me. I finally forced myself to keep watching it with my mom there to be able to vent to as needed (she's also a huge fan of P&P and of the Rintoul version), and got through it OK and then wrote this review afterwards.

POSITIVES OF THE A&E VERSION:

1) It is a visual feast: The costumes, sets and scenery are exquisite and make that version worth watching for that reason alone. They obviously had a larger budget than the 80s version, which is done in the old BBC 'stage play' style.

2) Since that version is 75 minutes longer than the BBC version, you get to enjoy that much more of Austen's incomparable dialogue - the best ever written in the English language besides Shakespeare, in my opinion!

3) In the interplays between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, their emotions are much more pronounced and open than in the BBC version... which makes their relationship more openly romantic even than in the novel. This is developed further by some scenes of them individually that weren't in the novel. In the 80s version and the novel, many of the subtleties of their relationship and feelings are left to the imagination. The A&E version is more in the unsubtle style of a typical modern romantic movie, which gives a wonderful new dimension to the story. The ""unexpected proposal"" scene is absolutely perfect; I think Austen would have loved it!

4) Casting Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Although not as strikingly handsome as David Rintoul's Darcy in the 80s version (in the book, Darcy is far handsomer than Bingley), Firth adds more visible emotion to the character which David R. did not, while also maintaining a very aristocratic, refined air about him.

POSITIVES OF THIS 80s BBC VERSION:

1) It is much more faithful to the historical setting of the novel. It captures much more accurately the slow-moving, thoughtful, refined, restrained, purist, obsessed-with-manners (but still quite amusing) aristocratic society of 18th century England. This to me gives not only a needed believability to, but also a much deeper understanding of, the characters and story. Austen's novels were very realistic and true to their time and place, so if you want the genuine Austen feel rather than the 'in-your-face' Hollywood style, see the 80s version (or just stick to the book). The A&E version comes across as being 20th century American, just cloaked in 18th century England costumes and sets. Some people have praised this aspect of it, saying that the 80s version is boring by comparison. But I believe that Austen's intent was that the interest in her novels would lie with her detailed character studies and intricate relational plots. That's what made her books so interesting, without all the action-packed gallivanting around and crassness which Hollywood seems to think is a necessity to entertainment. The 80s version recognizes this and retains a historical elegance and dignity; the A&E version does not. (In the A&E version, Bingley's two supposedly high class sisters slouch around, make faces and giggle audibly behind people's backs. Everyone seems to be constantly running, skipping or galloping somewhere. The less-than-savory characters, like Mary, Lydia, Kitty, and Mr. Wickham, look and act like they are from a much lower social class, in ways that go below what would have been acceptable in their class. A visitor to the Bennett home accidentally sees one of the sisters in her undergarments. When Elizabeth visits Pemberley, she sees Mr. Darcy coming from a dip in a pond with a wet undershirt on, rather than just having arrived in a carriage as in the book.)

2) The casting is better in the BBC version and each actor is completely natural and believable in his or her role. In the A&E version, much of the casting does not seem to fit the characters: Elizabeth comes across as being about twenty years older than she is (with a constantly knowing look as if she's already married with children), Mrs. Bennett seems too intelligent to be so silly, Charlotte seems snobby rather than humble, Miss Bingley seems cold and sharp rather than sweetly slimy, and Mr. Collins is like a cartoon and not a believable person. The actors seemed quite competent, just not cast in the right roles, and maybe directed to overplay them. The only exception, as I mentioned above, is Colin Firth as Darcy.

3) The 80s BBC version gives the same attention to each character that Austen's novel does. In the A&E version, only the principal characters are focused on, with the result that many of the characters who we should have gotten to know better seemed to just be cardboard props, and their relationships with each other don't come across as being as intimate and familiar as they really are in the novel. For example, Elizabeth had a much deeper relationship with her father, her friend Charlotte and her Aunt Gardiner than the A&E version portrayed, because it left out some key scenes between those characters. The only ones I could perceive as being really close in the A&E version were Elizabeth and Jane - and in the last half, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. This is a great loss, because Austen's novels are not just about romance, but about the relationships between people, and each of their interesting personality quirks. They are character studies -- not just of the main characters, but of ALL the characters.

BUT AS ALWAYS, it's a good idea to 1) read the negative reviews as well as the positive, since they are wildly different from each other, and 2) RENT before you buy!",1066694400,893,6415,4.936978683966636
300204,5,6300248569,"I prefer this version to the A&E version for several reasons. In this version, Austin's original ideas come through much clearer. I thought the acting stayed much closer to the ideas in the book. Ehle and Firth's Elizabeth and Darcy are constantly sniping at each other. Garvie and Rintoul's Elizabeth and Darcy are both much colder initially - which make their real fights memorable, not just more of the same. You can see the increasing emotions between them as each argument actually breaks down a barrier between them. This version's Mrs Bennett is also not so overacted. One of the main purposes for adding the character of Lady Catherine was to show, though there were objections to Elizabeth's relatives, Darcy had a few ill-mannered and unfortunate family members himself. In the meeting between Mrs Bennett and Lady Catherine in the book, the whole idea was to show Mrs Bennett was actually less embarrassing than Lady Catherine. I also prefer the performance of this Lady Catherine. She is dignified and elegant, which makes the revelation she is nothing but a windbag more surprising. She is also constantly giving tips, pointers and commands. Her arrival at the Collins' house in horror because ""the butcher has just told me you have ordered a whole leg of lamb. A half will surely do this time of year"" is a delightful illustration of her meddling. Overall, this version shows events more gradually rather than beating the viewers over the head with who the characters are and what is happening. It's only disadvantage to the A&E version is, because it is shorter, it has to leave out a few scenes. It does a good job of making it up, however, by staying focused where the A&E version tends to wander a bit.",1065484800,43,1720,4.8141891891891895
300205,5,6300248569,"I have watched the newer A&E adaptation of ""Pride & Prejudice"" (starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth) a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it very much. Last week, I borrowed from the local British Council Library, the video of this much earlier (1980) adaptation of Austen's novel. And my verdict? I find this earlier production to be MUCH, MUCH superior to A&E's!!

The casting is perfect, principally Elizabeth Garvie (an Elizabeth playing ""Elizabeth Bennett"", how very nice!), David Rintoul (as Mr Darcy) and the actors playing Mr & Mrs Bennett (brilliant performance from both), Mr Collins, Charlotte Lucas and oh, just about EACH and EVERY character! I must give my opinion that I find the Mr Darcy here far handsomer than that portrayed by Colin Firth. David Rintoul's Darcy is classically handsome - tall, dark, brooding, with nicely chiselled features and a very noble bearing. I loved to hear him speak. Elizabeth here is reasonably pretty too, has a ready wit and also displays great sensibility and generosity (I thought Jennifer Ehle was a little chubby for her character). The Mr Collins in this earlier production is also truer to the book; he is still odious, self-centred and annoying to the last degree, but is less of a caricature than that portrayed in A&E's version.

But I enjoyed this production best of all for the following 3 reasons:

1) I like it that some of Elizabeth's most important thoughts are made known to the viewer through a voice-over. For instance, after rejecting Darcy's proposal, we find Elizabeth, not in tears like in the A&E's version, but thoughtful and a little dazed, and as she sits down to ""digest"" what has just happened, the voice-over lets us know what she is thinking. At the end of her thoughts, when she smiles and concludes that she finds Darcy's proposal, ""gratifying"", I find it plausible. Who in Elizabeth's position wouldn't find Darcy's proposal flattering?

2) Although made in 1980, this production does not look at all ""jaded"" or 1980s (unlike many earlier BBC dramas). The costumes are beautiful (with many costume changes for the main characters) and the make-up does not give the impression that this is an outdated production. The characters too do not look like they are wearing wigs. I only wish it will be made available on DVD soon with perhaps the colour and picture quality improved.

3) The ending here is more pleasing and romantic than A&E's. The words uttered by our hero and heroine in the end are sweet and romantic and will stay in the viewer's mind for a long time.

If you have enjoyed A&E's adaptation, then I urge you to pick up this earlier video and see for yourself why the latter is the better and more enjoyable production. I also notice that the newer adaptation actually took a lot of ""ideas"" from this earlier production.

To me, this video was 259 minutes of pure viewing pleasure!",1058659200,342,2876,4.821501014198783
300206,5,6300248569,"This version is the true evil. I watched it for 6 times now since
the purchasing two weeks ago. And now I am kind of additive to it. I can't stop wanting it. My wife shared the same feeling with me. This is the true Jane Austen.
I also watched A&E 96 version, which is
a real angel, I guess, too good for me -- I finished it with great anger. I particularly don't like the acting of Mrs. Bennet, it is all pretentious.

*------------------------------------------------------
* a more thorough review that I posted for 1995 verion:
*------------------------------------------------------
I cannot comment on this film (1995 A&E version)without comparing it with the 1980 BBC's version. If I hadn't seen the 1980 BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"", I would probably adore this 1995 film like many people here. However, I must say that except the lavish decoration, this film is far inferior to the 1980 BBC's P&P in every respect: screenplay, performance, music, etc.

It's a pity that quite a few people are mistaken Jane Austen's spirited novel with a simple romantic story; one reviewer even praised the film as an epic. In her book, Austen writes about a serious topic with subtle humor, which is exactly what A&E version fails to capture. Both movies have added some lines or scenes based on the original novel, however, the Garvie/Rintoul is more true to the novel. Some people like A&E version because of the ""extras"" it offers, while some of these are described on the book such as Mr. Dancy's preventing his sister eloping with Wickham and later his searching for Lydia and Wickham in London, others are merely screenwriter's add-ons, three examples here, the first is Colin Firth came out of his bath and saw Jennifer Ehle playing with a dog, the second is the wet Colin Firth encountered Jennifer Ehle unexpectedly in Pemberly, and the third is Colin Firth practices fencing to show his determination of winning back Jennifer Ehle's affection. These are ridiculous and unnecessary. At the same time, the A&E version has missed or changed some important scenes that are essential to the book. For instance, Lizzy's first piano performance at Lucas' ball (instead, she went off to teach Lydia how to behave). Most of the interesting dialogues between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley are completely gone. Two in particular, one is after Mr. Darcy tells how he admires Elizabeth's beautiful eyes, the other is Miss Bingley's compliments about Mr. Darcy's writing. One dialogue is badly rewritten: in the book Mr. Darcy gives two reasons why he doesn't want to join Elizabeth and Miss Bingley in their walking about the room, here in the A&E film, he's only shown half intelligent and sharp by omitting one reason. Also the part where Elizabeth observes and analyzes his father's attitude towards his wife is replaced by ""daily proof"". The last part where she analyzes how Mr. Darcy falls in love with her at the first place should have been kept.

Regarding the acting, old BBC's version is more close to the period. Characters are more lady and gentlemen like. Characters in the A&E version, on the contrary, do not behave as courtly as they should. Upon seeing Ehle crossing her arms when listening to her father's comments on her refusal to Mr. Collins' proposal, I dislike this Elizabeth considering her very rude.

The A&E version is entirely miscast with the exception of Charlotte or maybe Mr. Bennet. Jennifer Ehle misinterprets Lizzy totally. She's not even physically up to the description in the novel. She always reads her lines in a hurry and even needs to catch her breath in order to finish the sentence. She doesn't show any wit and appears proud and rude like the two Miss Bingley (when she went to visit her sick sister and came across with Colin Firth [another ""extra""], he appeared much more polite than she). Elizabeth Garvie's Lizzy is adorable, witty and beautiful. She IS Elizabeth, no doubt. Colin Firth is not a proud Darcy but rather a miserable one with gloomy eyes. David Rintoul may lack Firth's sensuality, but he IS the proud and satirical Mr. Darcy. A&E's Jane is not as sweet and beautiful as Sabina Franklyn's Jane. Bingley is OK but could be more candid. His sisters are hateful. Miss Bingley doesn't show any interest in pursuing Darcy (in the early BBC's version, Miss Bingley is perfectly portrayed by Marsha Fitzalan). Mr. Wickham is not as handsome and attractive as described in the book. Alison Steadman's Mrs. Benetts is nothing but noisy, Priscilla Morgan's Mrs. Bennet is a simple-minded mother whose entire interest is to have her 5 daughters well married. A&E's Mary is abominable while Tessa Peake-Jones's Mary is a young lovely bookworm with lot of comments. I particularly dislike David Bamber's Mr. Collins. He is not funny at all and appears despicable, Malcolm Rennie's Collins, instead is much more comical with his distinct long figure, awkward movements and some details such as the non-stop apology. Lady Catherine de Bourgh is OK but lack the bossiness as Judy Parfitt's portrayal of her.

The music in 1980's version is a perfect match to the film.

The A&E version is a fine productin and a great entertainment, but definitely not Austen.",1050364800,7,5193,4.915621436716077
300207,4,6300248569,"I first saw the film about 20 years ago, and after having enjoyed -very much- the A&E version decided to buy this one and compare.  Each one is good in its own way. In general I like the actors better in this version, Elizabeth Garvie is my Miss Bennet, although I wished she showed a bit more rage in the first proposal version. All the ""negative"" characters -Mr Collins, the Bingley sisters, Mrs Bennet and Lady Catherine- are more natural here and truer to the book. Mrs Bennet is equally silly, but you do not wish to beat her to death every time she appears. The only one I didn't like at all is Mr Darcy.  Good looking, but too stiff. OK, I know the character is haughty, but he lacks sparkle. Except for the last 5 minutes he is completely expresionless.  The A&E version actor is far better.
As for the script, the story is more static in this version, but the dialogues are delightful and truer to the novel. The zinging between Mr. and Mrs Bennet and Between Mrs Bennet and Lady Lucas is priceless. The only think I don't agree with is the ending. Just terrible. The first time I saw it I thought it was a defect of my video version but no. Thet's why I haven't given them an extra star.",1049673600,5,1197,4.287610619469026
300208,5,6300248569,"This is still, by far, my favorite of the three main versions of P & P available. I like the acting in this one, for the most part, much better. As said by another reviewer, Elizabeth Garvie makes the perfect Eliza Bennett. One thing about E. Garvie though, it was lamented in another review that she had not done much other acting. In fact I can name at least one other thing that I have seen her in: an episode of Fairy Tale Theater called ""The 12 Dancing Princesses"", a series that played on PBS about 10 years ago. I don't know if it is still available, but worth checking out.
With regards to the other acting, I liked the portrayal of Mrs. Bennett much better, and also the portrayal of Mr. Collins. The one doesn't need to seem so disagreeable, and the other, not so slimy (comparing to A&E version)",1043971200,6,806,4.344370860927152
300247,3,6300248569,"Firstly, the book is one of the great novels of the language.  I enjoyed it immensely several years before seeing any of the movies.  I have never laughed out loud and let out so many exclamations of shear enthusiasm while reading any other novel.  I am no Janite, having read the novel only twice, but I had high standards in anticipating any movie adaptation.  I would recommend anyone to first read the novel.
Now I can honestly get to the movie.  I enjoyed this version without any real enthusiasm.  I think most of the characters are credibly done, except for Darcy.  I agree with the above reviewers who state that he is too stiff.  In contrast to the magnificent presence of Colin Firth in the more recent adaptation Rintoul gives me no indication why Elizabeth would fall for him, while Firth is wonderful in the role and this consideration just never enters into the equation. (I wonder what a young Cary Grant would have done with this role?).  No question I would recommend the more recent version with Firth over this one.  That being said I wish I had had the chance to see this one first because I would not have been so spoiled by the 4 or 5 times I have watched Firth excell in the role. I did enjoy comparing the two different portrayals of Elizabeth, by Garvie in this one, and by Ehle in the other, because they highlight different aspects of her personality, though I do find Ehle's portrayal both more sympathetic and believable in the other version.  A few of the minor characters I marginally preferred in this version.  Certainly, if one can only afford one version I would strongly recommend the purchase of the other one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.",1043280000,4,1682,4.588628762541806
300248,5,6300248569,My absolute favorite version of this classic! I'm on my second set of vcr tapes and am hoping they release it on dvd. A&E version can't hold a candle to this one!,1042502400,9,162,4.09375
300249,5,6300248569,"In this production the music is brilliant.  Watch the film again and listen to the ""conversation"" between Mary and the carter who is going along the road outside Longbourne at the very beginning. Mary's voice is represented by a staccato violin and the carter's replies are deep cello notes. Mary comes rushing back into the house and announces, ""I know who is moving into Netherfield Hall!""  Then the oboe (I think it's an oboe, anyway) that accompanies our first sight of Mr Collins.  Wonderful.
The production values aren't what we're used to these days (it's probably not a budget problem as some have assumed), but the script, the actors, everything is just so right.  My special favourite is Mr Darcy.  His stiffness isn't wooden, in my opinion, it's the pride he wears until Lizzie knocks some of it out of him.  At the end, when they're now engaged and are reviewing the previous mishaps in their relationship, he unbends to the point where he can't stop smiling.  It's a smile worth waiting for!",1042156800,8,1004,4.76878612716763

300252,3,6300248569,"I completely agree with the reviewer who stated that the reviews for this film were misleading.  The razor-sharp Austen wit was almost entirely absent in this version while I laughed the whole film through during the A&E version.  There was no dramatic build up which you would think would make the ending less disappointing, but sadly it does not.  The last scene ends and you are left saying to yourself, ""That can't be it!""  Immediately after the movie ended, I felt the incredible urge to put in my A&E DVD and make all right with the world again.

300254,1,6300248569,"I used to think that one could not produce a worse adaptation of Pride and Prejudice than the 1940 version.  I stand corrected.  I have now seen, what is unmistakeably, one of the worst mini-series in history.
Jane Austen's lively banter and sparkling wit is reduced to nonsensical drivel in the mouths of these paltry actors (assuming they ARE actors, as I have yet to see another collection of more amateur performers).  No one seems to understand (or even care about) the point of any scene that is being filmed, as the actors anticipate each other's lines with breakneck speed.

Many have complained of David Rintoul's woodenness as Darcy, but I think all the performers could not be less lifelike.  The movie might be thought amusing if it was billed properly as ""Jane Austen's Night of the Living Dead"".  Elizabeth Garvie appears to be on Prozac, as she maintains a vague, blank smile throughout the series, which is supposed to capture the entire range of Lizzy Bennett's emotions.
And this remarkably poor performance is riddled with absurdities such as interiors which look as realistic as cardboard, unlikely costumes, horrid dance choreography, added scenes that do nothing to further the plot or develop the characters, and the flat effect of filming in video.
If you haven't seen this adaptation, but your curiousity is getting the better of you (as mine did), I guarantee that you will be kicking yourself after wasting four hours of your life.  I now am able to view the 1940 film in a more forgiving light, and can appreciate its redeeming qualities.  Of course, the cream of the crop is the 1995 Ehle/Firth adaptation, which is most faithful to the spirit and the brilliant prose of Jane Austen.",1031356800,18,1712,4.859106529209622
300255,1,6300248569,"This production has nothing to recommend itself other than it's costuming. For the student of costume, it is an acceptable piece. Nothing stunning nor remarkable. And the agonies you will go through in watching it, to study the costume, are surely not worth the experience.
For anyone viewing it, this production is pure torture. It is shot in the old style video process, with no background music, and reminds one very much of the old ""Dark Shadows"" TV show. The acting is just about as bad overall. The acting by the women playing the Bennett daughters is so uniformly insipid as to make them almost completely indistinguishable from one another, with the exception of the character of Mary. The woman playing Jane plays her with such peevishness one is completely mystified as to why her sister regards her so highly. Lizzie herself is completely indistinguishable from Jane, Lydia and Kitty until nearly an hour into the production. Forget Lydia's pert ways, you'll never be able to tell which pert and peevish sister is supposed to be Lydia, or the saintly Jane. They all run together.
And Darcy! My god, Barnabas Collins was played with more life and sensuality. This man is so wooden as to be grisly in the role. You can't even see his eyes, they are mere slits in ghastly pale and gaunt face. Anyone who'se seen Colin Firth's Darcy, which is all eyes and facial expression, will be grossly disappointed with this performance. For the Gothic fancier, I believe this man would be the perfect incarnation of any vampire of literature. I take it back. Anne Rice writes more charming characters.
And don't get me started on the dancing.... I was very strongly brought to mind of elephants attempting to skip. The dancing scenes must be avoided at all costs. In fact, I was so uncomfortable watching this entire production, that surely it must be a feeling transmitted from the actors. They are not in the least comfortable in their roles, nor do they appear to have the least affection for their characters. Anything more purposely designed to make you loathe and detest Jane Austen is simply unknown to me.
At least Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier were spirited and amusing in their version of this classic. This production has nothing whatsoever to recommend itself. If you think of buying this because the price of the Ehle/Firth production is beyond your pocketbook, you will be wasting your money. Save it, and look for the Ehle/Firth production used, here or on another auction site.",1030406400,14,2494,4.856807511737089
300256,3,6300248569,"The 1980 BBC version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is pleasurable viewing. Persons who have read the book with pleasure will find the familiar characters presented skillfully, and with no little attention to the spirit of the book.
However, in my opinion, the later version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth as d'Arcy is superior in practically every respect - from direction and acting, to costumes and even hairstyling. If I wanted to introduce a friend to a dramatization of ""Pride and Prejudice"", I would keep this edition on the shelf and given him or her the Colin Firth version.
I must add, too, that the video reproduction is surprisingly poor for a BBC/Warner release. The colors are washed out, especially in the interior scenes; for examples, the officers' coats are pinkish instead of scarlet. From time to time, figures in the foreground are slightly fuzzy or have a halo around them. The poor quality of the tape detracted from what is otherwise an enjoyable performance.",1029715200,7,988,4.957831325301205

He reminded more of Boris Karloff. This version was a big disappointment. There was no sexual tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the comedy between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett was lost as well. Elizabeth Bennett was played well, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Those who want a good representation of the book should try the 1995 version with Colin Firth.

I found his facial expressions revealed so much more than his words.  It really is more like a play than a movie and should be viewed in that style as theatre and movies are two different things!!!

I've had this video for about ten years and have read the book (at least) twice annually for fifteen years. Why the devotion to this 1980 adaptation?  Well, the book and the video are one in the same for me because Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul ARE Eliza and Darcy.  Not even the great Colin Firth can pull off a better Darcy. I think only a Jane Austen fan will truly understand the value of this version. For the rest of the world...I'm afraid you'll have to settle for A&E's glamourized version.",1022198400,36,677,4.616666666666666
300282,2,6300248569,"I will start by saying that I had viewed the magnificent Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" before this particular version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul.  But I am usually a pretty open-minded person, so I figured I'd give this version a look, since I truly enjoy the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy from Jane Austen's terrific novel.
It has been widely said that Elizabeth Garvie was a more compelling Elizabeth Bennet.  In this regard, though Ms. Garvie was quite capable in my eyes, her interpretation of Lizzie for me came across at times as almost...meek.  This is not complete bias to Ms. Ehle, whom I believe imbued Lizzie with fire and intellect, but something I merely felt did not ""translate"" properly with Ms. Garvie's Elizabeth (OK, maybe there is some bias.  But Ms. Garvie *does* have nice screen presence, as well.  It is merely different in nature.).  One scene in particular:  The proposal from Mr. Collins.  In the earlier version, Lizzie, it seems, is too gentle with Mr. Collins upon refusing his offer.  The words are right, but the mood is...off.  Contrast this to Ehle's portrayal -- I could see Elizabeth's chagrin, disdain, and reluctance in having to hear Mr. Collins' offer, and her offense when Mr. Collins implied that she was merely a silly female and playing hard to get.
The supporting cast of this earlier adaption, right or wrong, did not seem to ""gel"" for me.  In terms of each character, I much pereferred Susannah Harker's Jane (1995).  Yes, perhaps Jane in the '80s version was conventionally prettier, but Ehle and Harker sold me on the sisterly affection they shared for each other, whereas I did not feel that in the earlier adaption.  For that matter, I also think Julia Sawalha's Lydia in the A&E presentation was much more fleshed out as the officer-crazy, flighty girl she is supposed to be...and that helped to better set the foundation for her elopement with Wickham, since we're privy to her flighty, thoughtless nature.  I will easily admit that Mary, in this BBC version, does not seem as sour and had better characterization.  The later Mary seemed almost ashamed and resentful of her entire family.  Here, Mary is studious but not with too much ""bite"".  Since Kitty was so peripheral in both productions, it is a draw, but I think she was much more age-appropriate in the 1995 version and meshed well with her ""partner-in-crime"", Lydia.  Then we come to Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  I believe that Alison Steadham's portrayal in 1995 was a hoot...but Mrs. Bennet often seemed too over the top...very exaggerated.  I feel that her earlier portrayal rang more three-dimensional.  Yes, she was excitable and sometimes crass, but she did not seem overly so, as later portrayed.  But Mr. Bennet...I *much* preferred Benjamin Whitrow's interpretation in the A&E version.  His character had the sarcasm, humor, and wit but without the caustic nature.  It seemed to me as if he almost despised everyone in his family in the 1980s BBC adaption -- including Elizabeth.  The later adaption, for me, showed a man put upon but with love for his girls (even if his favorite was clearly Lizzie -- just look at the final scene before the end of the A&E version).  The rest of the supporting cast in both versions have their pluses and minuses.  For instance, Ms. Bingley did not come across as spiteful and cruel in the earlier version, but Mr. Collins is even more of a buffoon than portrayed in 1995.  It's all a matter of nuance, and what an individual prefers.  I find that though Garvie is charming, I much prefer Ehle's spicier Elizabeth.
Finally, Mr. Darcy.  David Rintoul seemed like an adequate actor...but he did not do the part of Darcy justice.  Yes, Darcy was a proud and arrogant man.  But I feel he missed the hidden layers that were beneath the surface.  Most of poor Mr. Rintoul's scenes simply had him glaring at those around him.  His face never seemed to soften, and, even when he was supposed to be changing for the love of Elizabeth, he seemed much too...stiff.  (HERE, I can clearly admit to bias overwhelmingly in favor of the outstanding Colin Firth.  His Mr. Darcy was a chameleon, and we were privy to every change in mood and demeanor.  To be fair, however, Mr. Rintoul did not have the luxury of showing all that Darcy did for his sister and Elizabeth, as Firth did when going after Wickham and Lydia, for example.)  Most of all, I feel that Rintoul and Garvie, while pleasant to view, did not ""click"".  Firth/Ehle had a powerful, magical chemistry that immediately drew me into wanting their Darcy and Elizabeth to fight their obstacles and be together.  Again, however, this is neither wrong nor right, but a matter of personal preference.  Your mileage may vary.
In essence, if you are a theater buff, this version may please you greatly.  The style of filming has an almost play-like quality to it, and the simplicity *does* offer a sort of charm for the BBC adaption.  Here, this is not a minus and would not be fair to deem it so because of the vast budgetary differences between the two.  However, if you're a viewer who enjoys intricacies of plot and depth, as well as first-rate aesthetics (costumes, dances, music, gorgeous scenery), I recommend spending a bit more on the A&E adaption.  It's three-hundred (quick!) minutes very well spent and highly addicting.",1020470400,23,5364,4.79520697167756
300283,4,6300248569,"I read the book of ""Pride and Prejudice"" before I ever saw any versions of it on screen and after reading ""Mansfield Park"" by Jane Austen (terrible book! You'll want to slaughter Fanny) can appreciate why most people enjoy P & P the most. Elizabeth was easily my favorite character because she is witty, has her faults, and is playful and fun. I didn't fall in love so much with Mr. Darcy who seemed a bit of a stick in the mud, but by the end of the book when they married I had plenty of warm, fuzzy feelings. Still, Mr. Darcy wasn't the most likable, so when I bought the more recent version and watched it, I was like WOW! 'Cuz not only do you like Mr. Darcy, you fall in love with him thanks to Collin Firth's superb acting. In the older version, however, David Rintoul played him a little too stiff and uppity. His portrayl is closer to that of Mr. Darcy than the dreadful Laurence Olivier version (Mr. Darcy is far too ""perky"" in that one). Still, even in the book, Mr. Darcy at least smiled every now and then; here he's as morose as a corpse. Jane in this version is prettier than Elizabeth as depicted in the book, which is better because I didn't find the Jane in the more modern version that pretty although I think the actress in the A&E version did a better job of portraying Jane's character. Comparing Elizabeth Garvie's performance and Jennifer Ehle's to determine a favorite is very tough. Garvie's performance is probably closer to the book as is the rest of the movie, but Jennifer Ehle's Lizzie is more playful, like Elizabeth is described as. I didn't really see Garvie as ""playful"", but she still did an excellent job. All in all, this version was just a whole lot more boring than the Firth/Ehle one. In that one I was hooked from beginning to end, but this one I found I just didn't really care one way or another. Mainly I just watched it to note the differences between both versions and the novel. This version is closer to the book, but all in all the version with Jennifer Ehle and Collin Firth is my favorite. There's such chemistry between the two main characters, which was lacking in the older one, so while it's all right, the BBC/A&E venture captured my heart more.",1017619200,15,2201,4.4236453201970445

I agree with the previous reviewer that at times it looks like it was filmed in someone's basement.  All the actors seem to rush through their lines and some seemed to be just reading through them for all the lack of emotion put into them. David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy was just too stone-like for my tastes.  Elizabeth Garvie was extremely good in this version, however.
I highly advise you to check out the newer A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Ehle is not as likable as Garvie but Firth's Mr. Darcy makes you forget that.",1017360000,3,702,4.503937007874016

It is quite faithful to the book, with very few deviations, and the characters, with the possible exception of Mary, are wonderfully and faithfully drawn.  I have watched only a few minutes of the A&E production and was so put off by the departures from the book in just that segment alone that I have never been interested in viewing the entire thing.  Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul are perfect in their roles, and they will forever personify Eliza and Darcy for me.",1015977600,11,602,4.495412844036697

The A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, is superb.  I  especially recommend the DVD with a featurette on the making of Pride and Predjudice.",1013731200,6,479,4.552941176470588
300316,5,6300248569,"It is obvious that fans of Jane Austen are divided on the subject of movie adaptions, especially with ""Pride and Prejudice.""  My father brought this film home from the library when I was 8 (I'm 18 now) and we all sat down and watched it.  Since then it has become a staple in our movie library.  Why?  Let me explain.  There are a few characters in P&P that really make or break an adaption if they are cast poorly -- Elizabeth, Darcy, Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Bennet, and Charlotte are a few I find important.  In this 80s BBC version, Elizabeth is played perfectly in all ranges of emotions (whereas the later A&E version's Elizabeth is just horrible and boring), Darcy softens before your eyes, Mrs. Bennet makes you love to hate her for all her nerves and nagging, Mr. Bennet is a perfect partner to Mrs. Bennet, and Charlotte really works well as Eliza's older friend.  All the characters I have mentioned are terrible in the A&E version, even though certain plot elements are present that are not present in this 80s adaption.  I really think it is important for any adaption not to feel hurried because it needs to capture the slowness of daily life that is only interrupted by planning for parties, throwing parties, and gossiping after parties.  If you feel that the Elizabeth in the A&E version falls flat, then I suggest you try this adaption.  The costumes are lovely, the scenery (especially at Pemberly) is beautiful, and Darcy and Elizabeth have some wonderful scenes together.  In another review it was mentioned that Garvie captures Elizabeth's sharpness and I would add, her quick wit.  I think your preference of adaptions depends on which characters mean the most to you from the perspective of the book.  I never liked Jane, for example, so I was glad to see her pushed somewhat into the background.  One thing I really miss from all versions is the commentary that is made by Elizabeth about her father, the point where she realizes what he has done to his family when with his intellect they could have all been so much more.  I also miss Lydia's letter in the end of the book, it always makes me chuckle.  Overall, I urge you to try this film out, the second part of it is superior to the first in my opinion but maybe I am just in a hurry to see Darcy and Elizabeth grow closer.",1010707200,20,2295,4.533980582524272
300317,5,6300248569,"Maybe because I saw this version first (before the 1996 version), but I prefer this one.  The actress that plays Elizabeth is excellent.  I like her Elizabeth much better than the 1996 Elizabeth.  Although I love Colin Firth (he's a hottie), I like the way that David Rintoul plays Mr. Darcy.  He comes off cold at the right times and warms up when he wants to - just as I imagine that Mr. Darcy would.  The production isn't as impressive, but if you like P&P, give this version a look.
When will they put this on DVD?",1007769600,9,518,4.298969072164948
300318,4,6300248569,"The thing that really annoyed me was that the dialogues had been switched around. For example, in the book, if Elizabeth says something to Jane, in this adaptation she says it instead to Wickham. Other than that, it was better than the 1996 adaptation because the characters seemed to fit in more. Elizabeth is not supposed to be more beautiful than Jane and surely she is not. David Rintoul was excellent, he is supposed to be slightly wooden so I am not sure I agree with all the criqitues of his performance. The two miscasts in my opinion were Wickham (I thought he was supposed be very handsome in looks, much more so than Darcy) and Kitty (why on earth was she so old?)
Overall, if you are a Jane Austen fan, you must see both adaptations but if you only want a romantic love story, get the A&E version.",1005264000,,809,4.4
300319,3,6300248569,"I enjoyed the movie, but i kept feeling like the characters where not what i portrayed them to be. I really disliked Mr. Darcy in the movie. He walked so unnaturally. I thought that his character didn't go through the great change that it should have gone through by the end. I thought Garvie played Elizabeth quite well, but I think she cried too much, she was way too sensitive. I thought of her as a much stronger character.
Wickham seemed so devious at the beginning as well, he just didn't seem as likeable as in the book when you first meet him. Charlotte and Elizabeth seemed to have no problem with each other after Charlotte married Mr. Collins, but in the book, they drifted from each other a bit.
One of the things, is I can't stand to be influenced by the movie. I don't want to think of the characters in such a way, which is definitely not the objective in making a movie based on a book. I feel it would ruin the book's well written characters.
They changed some of the scenes. They cut out some of the people, like when Eliza went to visit Charlotte, she was supposed to come with Charlotte's dad, and sister. And Eliza was supposed to cry, ""Oh thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!"" when she read the letter she left Mrs. Forster.
My favourite character in the movie was Lady Cathrine de Bourgh. I really did like the way they portrayed her. I laughed out loud when I heard her butting into the conversations.
Overall it was good, but not great. I'd watch it again, but not for a long, long time.",1005004800,5,1507,4.405017921146953

300321,3,6300248569,"Unfortunately, unnatural and unconvincing acting coupled with poor picture quality take much of the beauty out of Jane Austen's classic story.  We do not begin conversations only when we have entered a room no less than 5 seconds prior, but the actors in this film do.  The picture does not flow well from scene to scene because of this flaw in directing.  Mr. Darcy is sadly not what he should be, and the famous proposal scene, which should be one of the best due to its natural passion, is not at all up to par.  These flaws are primarily due to the era in which the film was produced, but this does not excuse them entirely.  In general it sticks to the book, which pleases me, but does not do justice to it.",998265600,6,712,4.323308270676692
300322,3,6300248569,"Then maybe, just maybe, you can see through all the distracting aspects of this production and enjoy it a great deal.  I confess I couldn't, and so I found it mediocre at best.  I prefer my theatre experience in an actual theatre.  When it's captured on film, however, the whole experience just screams ""unrealistic"" to me.  Perhaps it's the lower budget of theatre productions relative to most film productions, I'm not exactly sure, but the first distracting element of this movie was the way it was captured on film.  It looked cheap (although it probably wasn't).  But I'm not that shallow.  :-)  If the acting was spectacular, I'd get over the cheap appearance.  Unfortunately, I didn't find a whole lot worth praising about the acting either.  I agree with most viewers that Mr. Darcy was portrayed so stiffly by David Rintoul that Darcy comes off like a jerk pretty much throughout the entire movie.  I also found Mr. Bennet in this production to be nothing like my perception of him from the book.  He didn't come off as clever, just mean-spirited and bitter.  I don't remember much about the other characters (translation: they're forgettable).  As for Elizabeth, other Amazon reviewers seem to love Elizabeth Garvie's portrayal of Elizabeth.  I thought she did a fine job, but not spectacular.  Of course, I freely admit A&E's 1995 production of P&P is my favorite movie EVER, so I am partial to Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of the character.  However, I don't think I unfairly penalized this film for not being A&E's 1995 version.  I simply don't think there was anything utterly fantastic about this Masterpiece Theatre production.  It's decent and worth watching if you happen to stumble across it on PBS or something, but it's nothing I'd go out of my way to get.  It's simply not the kind of movie that sucks you in and forces you to care so much about it that you plan your kitchen and bathroom breaks around its commercials (or you put it on pause when you leave the room).  You know the kind of movies I'm talking about.  Unfortunately, this was NOT one of those.",997920000,6,2078,4.745810055865922

This production will always be in the shadow of the later A&E series, but there is nothing really wrong with that.  The A&E effort is also great, but not everyone can look past the comparative budgets to see that little extra theater magic that this cast and director wields.  Take the special scene where Darcy delivers his letter to Elizabeth; she reads it while he stalks off across the meadow.  When she is done, he is gone.  Not one director in a thousand could have done that in just the right way.

I tried to like this version, I really did. But when the Ehle/Firth version came out (which did not alter Austen's dialogue) I chucked it. I had to give it 3 stars because the acting and scenery are very good. The writing is just terrible! I mean, to take a great work and try to rewrite it is just horrific.",994809600,3,481,4.4772727272727275
300345,3,6300248569,"I think all of the previous reviews have interesting points of view, particularly in comparing this version to the later one starring Colin Firth. I think they both have their good points--I like this version mainly for Elizabeth Garvie's portrayal of Elizabeth, which seems much more true to the book. She's witty and also excitable; Jennifer Ehle portrays an Elizabeth who is so mellow she isn't very much like the original character. I also in this version much preferred Mr. Bennett (in the later version he seems more like a kindly old man than the sarcastic and eccentric wit of the book), Lady Catherine, Jane, and Miss Bingley. Although I think I preferred the Jane in this early version simply because she's actually pretty--the later version's actress, though perfectly competent, was not very attractive, and Jane's purported beauty is kind of important in the book itself. I also liked the Mr. Darcy in this version--I think one reason Firth comes off better is because you just get to see more of him so you start to warm up to him--David Rintoul doesn't get the same opportunity.
What I did like about the second version was its dramatization of Mr. Darcy's going to London and seeking Wickham and Lydia, as well as what he went through with Wickham attempting to run off with his sister. It fleshed it out.
Of the more minor characters: Lydia was MUCH better in the later version than in this one.  I think Miss Bingley was better in the first version. She seemed more comfortable with her lines, and wasn't as obviously bitchy--it made more sense that she would seek a friendship with Jane, at least initially.
Lady Catherine is much better in this version, mainly because she's much better fleshed out. She's hilarious.
Both of the series have elements where they are more true to the book than the other--I can't say I thought one was more true than the other. For example, in the book Elizabeth was outraged at Charlotte's marrying Mr. Collins; in the later version she's likewise upset (although gets over it quickly); in this version she a little surprised but overall quite sympathetic about it with Charlotte. On the other hand, in this version while Elizabeth is staying with Charlotte she's constantly running into Mr. Darcy while she's out walking, clearly by design on his part-he's courting her even if she doesn't quite get it because of previous experiences. So when he finally proposes it makes more sense that he might think that she would be ""expecting his addresses"" even if she doesn't--and all that is in the book. In the later Colin Firth version he simply runs into her by accident once while on horseback, stares at her, and moves on. So his proposal comes out of left field, why should she be ""expecting his addresses""? (I'm getting that from towards the end of the book, when they've finally gotten together, and he tells her that he thought she would be expecting his proposal--a scene that is also in both versions.)",990662400,210,2959,4.790606653620352
300346,4,6300248569,"If you are a Jane Austen fan, you'll probably enjoy having this production in your collection.  It's biggest detraction is that it is not A&E's P&P, and if you love that one, you may find yourself comparing the two with this one suffering by such comparison.
So setting aside A&E's version, the dialogue on this one is wonderful, very true to the book (with a few exceptions).  However, the acting is sometimes stiff and awkward, and at times the movie suffers from over-acting, with the exception of Lizzie (played by Garvie).
The costumes, settings and music are wonderful.  Mrs. Bennett is true to the book, but I found Mr. Bennett portrayed worse than he should have been.  There was little to like about him in this movie (he is one of my favorite characters in the book), and his lines are delivered with nastiness and little wit.  Fortunately he makes only a few appearances.
Charlotte is given the role as Lizzie's confidante, which should be Jane, who is reduced to a very shallow, peripheral character.  Mr. Collins is wonderfully silly, but Wickham and the rest of the Bennett sisters are not well-developed.
If you've seen the other BBC Austen productions from the 80's you will enjoy seeing some of your old ""friends.""  Charlotte is played by ""Elinor"" from the BBC production of ""Sense & Sensibility.""  Julia from BBC's ""Mansfield Park"" plays Miss Bingley very well.",982368000,20,1379,4.8382978723404255

The makers of this adaptation never lost sight of the fact that hidden between each and every line of Miss Austin's eloquent understatement, hidden behind the reserve of her characters, was a powerful, perfectly-paced story that had to be mused over, pondered, to be fully enjoyed.

Elizabeth Garvie, as Elizabeth Bennett, is delightfully gauche and witty at the same time and David Rintoul plays a dreamy and powerful Mr Darcy. Elizabeth's parents are so awful and yet so pathetically human that you really want to cringe for her - this is an incredibly entertaining version. See it and die!",978998400,17,699,4.833333333333333
300349,5,6300248569,"First let me say that I am absolutely rabid about the Colin Firth production.  I own it and have watched it dozens of times.  The sequence went like this: I saw the 1940 version many years ago, loved it.  Then saw the 1996 version (loved it).  Then a year or so ago I read the book (of course loved it).  A month or so ago I ordered this BBC version and also the old 1940 version.  I HATED the 1940 version after having been exposed to all the others, including the book.  It bears little resemblance to Austen.  In it, Mr. Darcy begins to fawn all over Eliza about halfway through, completely out of character.  There are many scenes that are completely fictitious and thus unsatisfying.  Anyway, back to this 1985 BBC production: after I got over the initial shock of the less posh production values, I grew more admiring of the spirit of Austen embodied in this version.  It is definitely the closest to the book.  Eliza is smart and spirited, more so than in the Firth version.  Darcy is truly objectionable for most of the movie, and is not quite such a hunk as Firth.  This movie doesn't resonate with the romantic promise that so captivated everyone about the Firth version.  But it is immensely satisfyng none the less.  It presents Austen's vision much better- all the characters (with the possible exception of Jane, whom I thought was better portrayed in the 1996 version) are more complex and better represented- particularly the parents.  There are several issues explained in this version that left me puzzled in the 1996 version (for example, the significance of Wickham & Lydia not having gone to Scotland: only in Scotland could you get married immediately, not possible in England).  I admit this is something of an obsession for me.  I've compared the book line for line with the videos and this contains more of the original.  Anyway, if you're mad about the A&E version, I highly recommend that you get this one and watch it a couple of times- it will definitely fill out your Pride and Prejudice experience.",973987200,7,2029,4.646067415730337
300350,5,6300248569,"I have seen other versions of P&P, but this is my all-time favorite. I grant that the company which produced it was obviously working with limited resources, but the superb casting and acting more than make up for it. Now, when I re-read P&P it is these actors I see. This Lizzie captures brilliantly the spark and spunk of Jane Austin's heroine and plays her role with real fire and charm. Father's sarcasm has just the right bite without being poisonous. The production's Mr Collins is wonderfully funny as the greatest bore in English literature. He is every girl's blind date from Hell, the nice guy who is, well, so creepy he makes your skin crawl, but because he obviously means well you feel guilty for wanting to, say, feign death or demonic possession to escape his attentions.

300351,5,6300248569,"I first saw this production on Masterpiece Theatre years ago, and I have loved it ever since.  I am an Austen junkie, having read this novel over  forty times (I teach it again and again, so I have an excuse).  While it's  easy to quibble with any film adaptation, this strikes me as particularly  sensitive to Austen's intent.  Virtually all the dialogue is straight from  the novel, the filmmakers made up very little, and most of the characters  seem right on target.  The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is portrayed  masterfully, wonderfully.  Dear Elizabeth Garvie (who plays Elizabeth  Bennet) - if you read this - I'm in love with you!  The other sisters are  all perfect, just perfect.
My only complaint is that Mr. Darcy here is  too stiff and unlikeable, though this is tricky since that is just how he  is supposed to seem to the Bennet family (while readers are supposed to  know he secretly admires Elizabeth and so must not be a total jerk).  In  this version, Darcy hardly seems to deserve Elizabeth, even in the late  scenes where we are supposed to rejoice over the match.
As another  reviewer noted at this site, this version is more theatre-like, the A&E  version with Colin Firth more movie-like. This production cost much less  than the A&E version, I bet, so the cinematography, music, and sets are  not what we expect from the movies.  On the other hand, the theatrical  style works perfectly for Austen.  The more modest sets and costumes strike  me as more nearly true to the world that Austen was out to portray, the  world she moved in.  The balls and drawing rooms in in the A&E version  are on too grand and rich a scale for the gentry Austen portrays.
I  rejoice that two such fine productions of P&P exist (the Greer Garson,  Lauren Olivier version doesn't count - too silly and too far from Austen's  novel - though Garson is sublimely beautiful).

I've loved the BBC production since I first saw it  in '85. Elizabeth Garvie is such a beautiful and sparkling Lizzie, and I  love Jane - much truer to the character, Mr. Wickham, and the Bennett  parents in this version (Mrs. Bennett is more real - not quite so over the  top).  I do admit that Colin Firth is the superior Mr. Darcy in the A&E  set. David Rintoul acts like Al Gore without the humor.  There are still  some sublime moments with the BBC version - mostly Lizzie's reactions -  with Garvie's fine eyes expressing so much.  The truncated 2-tape BBC set  cuts some of the lingering moments between characters - those transition  shots and comments, and even whole scenes that add to the richness of the  production.  It even feels sped up and cheap now. It's still good - but not  as great as it was. How do I know this for sure?  I found tapes 3 and 4  that I made from the original series on PBS - each one about 50 minutes  long, and am doing a comparison with the current BBC tape edition. Feeling  a little obsessed perhaps, but I'm mad about finding something I loved  now  appearing as P&P Lite! Since we're comparing a cut production to a full  version, it's really difficult to say which is ""better"" and a  more satisfying film of a favorite book.

The story kept quite close to the book in general.
Elizabeth was quite accurately portrayed as one who thinks things through. Her audible thoughts were useful in communicating the transformation of her attitudes.
Darcy was suitably haughty and cold in the beginning but could have softened and smiled more towards the middle and end.
Mr Bennet's affection and respect for Elizabeth are evident when they talk over backgammon and chess.
Lady Catherine was too young and not severe enough. However she was accurately portrayed as being arrogant and interferring even with the minutiae of the Collins' household affairs.
Mr Collins was well portrayed as having a mix of conceit n obsequiousness.
Charlotte was too pretty!
Lydia and Kitty were not silly and self centred enough. They even empathised with Elizabeth when Wickham was engaged to Ms King.
