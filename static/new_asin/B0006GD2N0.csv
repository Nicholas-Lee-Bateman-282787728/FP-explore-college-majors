3546016,4,B0006GD2N0,"Whoa, this was a surprisingly entertaining flick. It was about two unicyclist transversing the country of Bhutan. Besides viewing the country of Bhutan, you get glimpses of the culture and the difficult terrain these two unicyclists traveled. I recommend this movie.",1429228800,,266,5.512195121951219
3546017,5,B0006GD2N0,these unicyclists actually give a very kind-hearted and respectful and good introduction to Bhutan.  Well worth watching.  The filming is not professional but enjoyable nonetheless.,1391990400,,181,6.2
3546018,5,B0006GD2N0,"Into the Thunder Dragon wonderfuly blends two cultures into a nicely compeling experience.  On one hand you have an introduction to the incredibily scenic Butan and the fine people living there and on the other you get great exposure to some inspiring mountain unicycling.  Kris Holm and Nathan Hoover are the star riders as they pedal their muni's through bamboo, mountain tops and down some terrifiyingly steep stairs carved into the mountain side.  My only complaint about this film is that it left me wanting for more, so much in fact that the next day I ordered my first Muni and have been practicing every since.  The difficulty of this sport is what makes it fun!  If you enjoy a good physical challenge and like the idea of riding through the wilds on one wheel this film might just bite you enough to do the same.",1269388800,,822,4.602739726027397
8296599,4,B0006GD2N0,The film was better than I thought it would be.  I was afraid that it would be too frightening but those young men made going down mountains on the unicycle look easy.  The best part was learning the culture of the people where they cycled.,1464912000,,240,4.311111111111111
