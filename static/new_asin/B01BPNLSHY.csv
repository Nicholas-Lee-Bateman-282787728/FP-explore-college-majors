7665200,5,B01BPNLSHY,"Whether you are familiar with our state sport, or not, watch this documentary about Alaska, the dogs who absolutely love running, and a very real Alaskan, who is not only a cancer survivor, but the only 4-time back-to-back winner of Iditarod.
Lance  was the first to win back to back races in one year - the Yukon Quest, followed by Iditarod.
And if that isn't inspiring enough to learn about the 4-legged athletes who crave running, and the 2-legged athlete they love - learn about our home, and the beauty of Alaska.",1456099200,14,518,4.630434782608695
7665201,5,B01BPNLSHY,You won't be disappointed in this movie and you can't help but fall in love with the story.,1456099200,10,91,4.111111111111111
7665202,5,B01BPNLSHY,"We saw this in a special screening. Sled dog enthusiast or not, you will like, rather love, this movie! Filled with a gritty true story of Lance Mackey's life and challenges of being the only 4 time back to back winner of the Iditarod, it's also full of great dog footage, and some award worthy cinematography of the Alaskan landscape.
The story is real, the film is real, Lance is real. This a very well balanced movie that will be enjoyed by just about everyone.",1456099200,19,464,4.470588235294118

7665206,5,B01BPNLSHY,Very touching story of Iditarod racer and his family.,1491350400,,53,5.0
7665207,5,B01BPNLSHY,"It wasn't until I moved to Alaska in 1988 that I had even heard of the Iditarod; In fact one of my new friends there asked me if I thought Susan Butcher would win a 4th in a row in the Iditarod and my my response was ""what is an Iditarod?"". Every since I have kept track even after returning to the lower 48 and Lance Mackey has always been a favorite of mine. He embodies most of us as a common man doing extraordinary things. His love for his dogs shines through and it is obvious he would never hurt them to win a race. I have been an insider for many years and they just finished the 2017 race. Finding this film during this race capped it for me; what a wonderful tribute to an awesome man! I have to disagree with others who believe Lance will be overshadowed by other mushers; What he accomplished amid personal hardships will always be highly regarded and an inspiration to all mushers old and new. He may never race again but will always be involved until he is no longer with us.",1490659200,2,989,4.183246073298429
7665208,3,B01BPNLSHY,It was slow moving and a lot of the same stuff repeatedly. I felt disappointed as I like to recommend good movies. I doubt I will even watch it again.,1486598400,,150,4.033333333333333

7665210,5,B01BPNLSHY,I`ve been a fan of lance`s since he first won the Yukon quest and the Iditarod races back to back and I also had the pleasure of meeting him. Lance is very personable and very respectful and easy to talk to. I highly recommend this documentary you will find out just how driven this man is and how hard working and how caring he is for his dog`s.,1484092800,,346,4.102941176470588
7665211,4,B01BPNLSHY,"Great to watch, but doesn't live up to all Lance Mackey has accomplished. It's too obvious that this movie was sponsored by the Iditarod.",1481846400,,137,4.75
7665212,5,B01BPNLSHY,"Lance Mackey is truly an amazing man, and his story is fascinating.  This is a terrific movie!",1481760000,,94,4.529411764705882
7665213,5,B01BPNLSHY,"My goodness - we've always been Mackey fans, but this movie was amazing.  Our whole family of varying ages (from 7 years old through adult) was kept rapt when we watched this in our local independent movie house.  We went home and bought this one to share with our family in the Lower 48.  Rave reviews from their family, too.  Intense, intimate, and moving.  A quality character study of someone who faces many external challenges in a sport whose demands and intricacies are fairly unknown to anyone outside of the participants.  Very educational in that way.",1480982400,,561,4.791666666666667
7665214,3,B01BPNLSHY,"This is more or less a documentary about an champion ship dog sledder, and of course photography of Alaska is great, but that is easy right.  The person has all the rough edges most of us do and some demons to boot, but it did not interview other dog sledders to enlighten you about the rigors of the sport as a whole.  Still it does a great job of explaining this person's passion for the sport and his relationship with his dogs and Alaska.",1480636800,,442,4.25

7665223,5,B01BPNLSHY,"This documentary inspired me and touched me deeply.  About the only thing I have in common with Iditarod racers is that I love dogs. After watching this true story about Lance Mackey I have become a fan not only of Lance but of Iditarod. Something about Lance's humble and genuine nature and the struggles he has endured moved me to my core.  Iditarod, it turns out, is about much more than racing dogs over 1000 miles.  It is about overcoming a grueling environment and personal demons,  it is about beauty and it is about the deep bond between man and man's best friend. I watched it 5 times.",1471392000,,594,4.472222222222222

7665227,5,B01BPNLSHY,This is a wonderful movie about an amazing man. Lance Mackey has lived a very tough life & has endured to become a champion dog musher. He gives all the credit to his dogs. A true musher. Loved this movie. The scenery is spectacular.,1468972800,,233,4.318181818181818

7665233,5,B01BPNLSHY,"What an amazing man, and boy does he love his dogs!!  Movie was fantastic and scenery was awesome.
I had the honor of meeting him in Anchorage, Alaska a few years ago.  He was racing his younger dogs in the Fur Rendezvous.  He was friendly and greeted his fans warmly; he posed for photos and signed autographs.",1466208000,,311,4.421052631578948

7665237,4,B01BPNLSHY,"I've always been fascinated by Lance Mackay's unusual background and his successes in the Iditarod and other major dog sled races.  Seeing him interact with his dogs and running in some of these races brought reading about him (and a book by him) to life for me.  People who are interested in Alaska, dogs, and poor boy makes good stories will enjoy this beautiful film.",1465257600,,370,4.676923076923077
7665238,5,B01BPNLSHY,"This is a great movie about the struggles and triumphs of Lance Mackey, a sled dog racer who won the Iditarod four times in a row and also won the Yukon quest four times. You will see beautiful Alaskan landscapes and learn about sled dogs, the love of their trainer, and his love for them. Iditarod racing is a grueling sport. The men and women who participate in it are truly great athletes. This movie will keep you totally engaged. I highly recommend you see it! Five stars!",1464998400,,477,4.431818181818182

7665249,2,B01BPNLSHY,"Very inspiration, love the dogs and the story of Lance Mackey, however movie did not flow -- goes back and forth in time. In addition, the movie just doesn't t capture any of the drama and excitement one would expect. It was so boring, I even skipped through some parts thinking it had to get better, but that didn't happen.",1462060800,,324,4.416666666666667

7665255,5,B01BPNLSHY,Best documentary I've seen about the Iditarod,1461024000,,45,5.571428571428571
7665256,5,B01BPNLSHY,This was an amazing movie and one I could watch over and over again.  I had purchased it for my Mom since she is a huge Iditarod fan and Lance fan.  This is a great account of his life with some great footage from the Iditarod.  I highly recommend it for just the movie alone.  The extras are worth it as well.  Don't let the price stop you from purchasing it.  It is worth every penny.  It was shipped to me extremely fast and arrived ahead of time.,1460419200,,450,4.045454545454546
7665257,1,B01BPNLSHY,"This is the second time I've received this movie...and, sadly, neither one has worked in my DVD player or my laptop.  I had really wanted to be able to watch this since I live in Alaska, have been to the Iditarod starts (ceremonial and official) and have seen Lance Mackey there.  Not sure what the issue is...other than maybe the fact that both of the movies I've received have said they're ""Region 0"" and I know that the US generally requires a ""Region 1"" in order to play in our machines.  That said, I am sorely disappointed.  :(",1460332800,,533,4.408163265306122
7665258,5,B01BPNLSHY,"This is the real American champion! I loved this documentary, its a very human story and you do not need to know too much about the Iditarod to appreciate it. My idea of wading through the wilderness is building a snow man, my idea of a good dog is a long haired Maltese and I was completely riveted by this story. Lance Mackey is a hero. He battled cancer, he battled a dissolute lifestyle, he fought through disappointment and resentment over his father issues and then went on to win the Iditarod. There is a poignant scene where he describes the last 10 miles of the race where he stopped and went to speak to all his dogs and thank them, well I just lost it and couldn't stop the tears. This is such a well told story that you feel like you're right with him every step of the way and you're rooting for him. He's the REAL Lance American hero and he ain't no fraud!",1459641600,,870,4.2155688622754495
7665259,5,B01BPNLSHY,"Loved this film, it was everything and more than I expected.",1459468800,,60,4.545454545454546
7665260,5,B01BPNLSHY,"This film was presented at the 2016 DC Environmental Film Festival. I have been to Alaska twice, although not during the Iditarod. Lance Mackey is the only Iditarod musher who has won the extraordinary 1,000 mile race from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska, four times. This film shows the expansive Alaskan landscape as well as the extreme conditions endured by the mushers and their dog teams as they compete to win the unique race. As a wildlife photographer, Alaska enthusiast, and animal lover, this film was right up my alley. In addition, I am a family therapist and the film portrays not only Lance Mackey but also his father who was a musher and helped to resurrect the Iditarod race to encourage the breeding of sled dogs in Native villages throughout Alaska. Lance's mother also played a pivotal role in Lance's life and in the film. While the sled dogs, beautiful scenery, and the chance to view some of the Iditarod initially got me into the theatre, the family drama, as it played out during the film, drew me into Lance's life and struggles with the intensity of a Alfred Hitchcock mystery. This film is a love story about Lance's human family but also his canine family without whom he could not have achieved the incredible feat of 4 Iditarod wins.",1459382400,,1257,4.718181818181818

7665262,5,B01BPNLSHY,Fantastic look into one of the greatest mushers life. It also gives you a great look at what racing a 1049 mile race is all about. I highly recommend  this video  for anyone.,1459296000,,174,4.242424242424242

7665274,5,B01BPNLSHY,"This is a truly fantastic (in the literal sense) story and the filmmaker hit the jackpot with Lance Mackey. One of the most weirdly charismatic characters ever, Lance seems straight out of an Icelandic Saga, or maybe a Die Hard movie. And those eyes! Plus any movie that features puppies by the armload is worth seeing. A moving, fascinating, funny and genuinely unique film.",1458950400,,375,4.875

7665282,5,B01BPNLSHY,Lance's story is for all people. You don't need to love dogs or mush. It is a story of determination and living the Alaska life no matter what. I became a fan of Lance's shortly after moving here. He always took time with his fans and was incredibly human and kind to those fans. His honesty and courage has value to all people in all aspects of life. Go Lance Go!,1458777600,,364,4.140845070422535

7665288,5,B01BPNLSHY,"I just saw this movie in a movie theater. As a fan of the Iditarod, you have to love this movie for the action, storytelling, and beautiful show of the wild expanse the special few - the Iditarod mushers, bikers, and snowmachiners - get to travel; as a sled dog lover, you'll treasure the movie for the love shown for and by the dogs who make the Iditarod adventure possible for humans. As a believer in humility, you will cherish the movie for the insightful, brutal honesty that signifies Lance's attitude - not only on the screen, but in real life as well (I have talked to him more than once, and he is a very nice, humble person) -, even though life has dealt him a few tough choices. As a Lance fan, you have to respect his ""don't-give-up"" mantra. Yes, there may be somebody else winning four Iditarod races in a row, but couple that with the Yukon Quest wins, and Lance may hold this particular crown forever, and well-earned. This movie shows that Lance has a lot to tell and give, and I am waiting eagerly for his next move. Well worth seeing, and owning.",1458345600,,1064,4.378787878787879

This is an unforgettable story of human will and dedication supported by breathtaking cinematography of the Alaska wilderness.  For those who are unfamiliar with dog mushing in general (the Alaska state sport) or the annual Iditarod 1000 mile race, this movie provides terrific insight on the process.  At the center of the story is Lance's dedication to his dog team; they are truly like his children.

This is a film that bears watching and re-watching, a truly unique and incredibly inspirational tale.",1457654400,,679,5.026785714285714
7665302,5,B01BPNLSHY,"This is a GREAT film. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves stories about winning attitudes, conquering adversity and WINNING at Life!!! Lance Mackey is truly an AMAZING athlete. In fact, I think the very BEST athletes are the mushers & the dogs that race in the Alaskan Iditarod. Lance Mackey is probably the strongest, most motivated and inspirational guy I know...coming back from cancer, winning 4 Iditarods in a row and overcoming devastating adversity with his positive attitude!",1457654400,,489,5.125

It is so amazing to see someone with so many health problems ignore the negative and focus on the positive.  The movie is excellently done and gives new understanding to what he has gone through and how he persevered.  While many people would give up with so many health problems, Lance gives it his all with his second chance to live.

7665313,5,B01BPNLSHY,"10+.  Already a fan, I had recruited eight people that I work with who had zero knowledge of Lance and the Iditarod to attend the screening with me. I knew very well that they would also become lifelong fans, not only of Lance but of the Iditarod and it's incredible stories which just seem to inspire and get better and better year after year. The most amazing treasure about this film is getting to know one of the most genuine, inspiring, endearing, magnetic, personalities of my time. I can't get enough of the way Lance is so brutally honest- the emotions and feelings he shares are so to be admired as most people stifle that aspect and never share it. At times I just shake my head and think what a ""hot mess"" Lance is - yet so inspirational -he carries himself was such a sincere, genuine, appreciation, showing such an intense, deep, emotional side which is so inspiring.

This is not just a story about sled dog racing, it's about overcoming life obstacles, about challenging yourself, and about being real with who you are.  It also had incredible cinematography, a great story and the best music score I have heard in a long time. And puppies...this movie has puppies!  This is the kind of movie the biggest screen HDTV's with surround sound were made for, so get your blanket and snuggle up for an incredible winter experience (you will get cold watching this movie...even in Florida).",1456444800,,611,4.691588785046729

7665318,5,B01BPNLSHY,"Sublime filmmaking.

As many have already noted, the unfolding story of Lance Mackey is a heartrending, joyous and exciting tale. I was fortunate enough to view this at a film festival where Lance, his mother and his dog Amp appeared for a Q&A session. It's sometimes a tough story and shows a man who is all too human. And really, that's what makes him great. There are no tennis shoe endorsements, no People magazine covers, no multi-million dollar contracts. Its the story of a man many consider the worlds greatest athlete.
And his dogs. His family. Alaska.

The filmmaking by Greg Kohs is amazing. Everything, from the cinematography to the script to the score are exceptional. In a day when Hollywood is pumping out glossy, two dimensional blockbusters, this little gem shines and IMO, was one of the best films of 2015. When I saw it, the audience gasped, laughed, cried and cheered. How often do you find that level of emotional reaction to a movie?

Go get your copy, watch, then take the time to cheer on Lance and all the Mackeys in this year's Iditarod! See why ""Superman wears Lance Mackey pajamas!""",1456272000,8,1112,4.721649484536083

Lance found his, will I find mine, will you find your's?
Are we really willing to make the deep down critical, heart-based decisions to do that, like Lance did with choosing his dogs and his passion to race over his own partying, reckless and heedless life living to settle down and get stable and really strong, strong mentally, spiritually, physically?
