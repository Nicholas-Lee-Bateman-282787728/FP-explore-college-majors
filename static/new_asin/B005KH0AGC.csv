8476808,4,B005KH0AGC,"In ""Das Frivole Spielfilm-Paket"", one gets two fairly decent 'sex comedies' from none other than yours truly---Alois Brummer!

Disc One: ""Unterm Dirndl wird gejodelt"" (from 1973 and directed by Alois Brummer, and AKA ""How Sweet Is Her Valley""). When Heidi' (buxom blonde---Gisela Schwartz), is back from school for the summer; to her small, rural, but rustic and scenic Bavarian hometown, she unselfishly pitches in on work around the farm, but still manages to catch-up on a lot of alfresco-alpine-activity (yikes!). Not to mention the fact that our heroine 'Heidi' (Gisela Schwartz) has a delicious and desirable back-side, that we get to see quite often, via peek-a-boo up-skirt shots (......didn't I say......not to mention.....!). Among other feminine delights, like ""haarige muschi"" for instance (Kapit&auml;n, meine Pistole z&uuml;ndete hat!) Schei&szlig;e!! Yikes!!

The cast of German lovelies: Gisela Schwartz, Annemarie Wiese, Monika Rohde (as Monique Rohde), Uschi Stiegelmaier, Marie Luise Lusewitz, Britt Corvin, Mariama Barry, Karin Hofmann, Flavia Keyt, and Eleonore Leipert. I gave it 4 stars.

The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent, the film has been fully-restored. PAL format, German (no English subtitles), FFN, NR 86 mins.

 Disc Two: ""Hey Marie - Ich brauch mehr Schlaf Auf ins blaukarierte Himmelbett"" (from 1974 was also produced and directed by Alois Brummer, and AKA ""Hey Marie, I Need More Sleep""). This one was even better than the first. When a sleepy idyllic Bavarian hamlet goes mad scurrying for a supposedly ""hidden and buried treasure"", little do they know that it's figuratively and literally right in front of their eyes in the abundant presence of their naturally beautiful ""womenfolk"". So, raise a glass of beer (and believe me......you will get a raise......or something.....!), and let's toast to the forested scenery of Germany (no pun intended)! Yikes! There's actually a pretty funny opening-montage too, of a speeding-bicycling mailman high-on-testosterone, that tramples on everything in his way (including disrobing a passing couple)! I gave it 4 stars!

The ""forested scenery"": Judith Fritsch, Astrid Boner, Rita Waldenberg, Marisa Feldy, Roswitha Geuther, and Karin Lorson. I give it a well-deserved 4 stars. BTW: as seeing that these were made by Alois Brummer productions; don't be surprised if there also exists ""hardcore"" versions of the two.

The picture and sound quality is excellent. A fine job, on a full-restoration. PAL format, German (no English subtitles), FFN, NR 82 mins. (BTW: Dr. Karl Von Leckendiegrossenhaarigemuschiundstr&auml;ucher highly recommends these two classic German sex-comedies.)

Love and Peace,
