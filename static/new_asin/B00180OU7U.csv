3176581,4,B00180OU7U,"This drama is based on the story of Phyllis Reynolds Naylor that shows the growing pains of a teenager named Alice McKinley (Alyson Stoner.) Strongly supported by the fine performance of Penny Marshall as Mrs. Plotkin and Luke Perry as Ben McKinley, the movie depicts the sad and painful years of a teenager who lost her mother when she was five. Her father Ben is of little help since he is still in a state sadness after losing his wife. Adjusting to the life of widower and bringing up two children on his own is a little too much for him. In the meantime Alice learns to live in a fantasy world with vivid imagination to keep her happy. With some help from her teacher Mrs. Plotkin, she learns to be less judgmental in life and grows to a reasonable young woman. The movie shows a contrasting life of her big brother Lester (Lucas Grabeel) who seems to have a normal life and even popular among girls. The movie shows the vulnerability of growing young woman without her mother, but apparently has lesser impact on a boy. Alice Stoner offers a brilliant performance in this excellent family drama: Highly recommended for family viewing.

3176582,4,B00180OU7U,"Alice (Alyson Stoner) is a sixth grader whose real life doesn't always match the one she imagines for herself.

When her father (Luke Perry) turns Alice's life upside down by moving her and her aspiring-rock-star brother (Lucas Grabeel) to a new town, Alice soon discovers she isn't the fashionable and cool girl she wishes she were. Her teacher is the strict Mrs. Plotkin (Penny Marshall), and not the beautiful, sweet and seemingly perfect Miss Cole. And the leading role in the school musical she wants so badly . . . Well, maybe it's not for her.

But Alice soon discovers that sometimes it takes getting your life turned upside down for you to discover what's most important and who you really are.

""Alice Upside Down"" is funny and charming. It starts slowly, but in the end it evokes both laughter and tears. Penny Marshall is particularly wonderful as the strict Mrs. Plotkin, who has more to teach Alice than Alice can know at first glance. This is a charming film for tween girls, and it is surprisingly watchable for their moms as well.

This isn't a big screen blockbuster. This is a sweet film, which has more in common with an after school special, ""Harriet the Spy"" or ""Little Secrets"" than ""Bridge to Terabithia"" or even ""Akeelah and the Bee."" But Mrs. Plotkin has something important to teach Alice, a lesson that is sure to resonate with many girls like her, making this a movie they'll remember fondly for a long time.",1217376000,,1437,4.690476190476191
3176583,4,B00180OU7U,"Based on the successful books by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, the adventures (if that's the right word) of the likeable but quirky Alice (Alyson Stoner) make it to the big screen in this Disney channel ready adolescent comedy drama. After the death of her mother, Alice is uprooted by father Ben and moved to a new town, school, teacher's friends and all that goes with it amidst her adolescent angst and tumultuous throws of simply being a teenager.
Her shyness and isolation leads her to live out her dreams in vivid fantasies that often get her into tricky (and often funny) situations.
That pretty much sums up the picture; it's fairly predictable as we watch her interactions and growth but gladly without being too sickly sweet.
A genial cast including the likes of Luke Perry and Penny Marshall as the (almost sinister) teacher Mrs. Plotkin, help the story along and give it a well rounded family appeal.
As long as you accept the intentions of the movie to appeal almost singularly to its targeted viewers you will enjoy it, although for me there wasn't enough breadth or character embellishment to covet a wider audience.
Overall 4 stars for some believable and solid acting performances from the young cast. Not my particular kind of movie, but a nice (and fairly safe) viewing time with the family.",1217376000,,1305,4.830357142857143
3176584,3,B00180OU7U,"A nice DVD for tweens that can teach them some lessons for life.  Alice struggles with real life issues with the death of her Mother, and her Dad moving the family to another town and away from her friends.  The acting is good and the plot can hold the viewer's interest.  Worth watching.",1217376000,,288,4.39622641509434
3176585,4,B00180OU7U,"""Alice Upside Down"" was an enjoyable movie.  Alyson Stoner plays Alice, who lost her mother 6 years ago (I don't believe the movie indicates how or why her mother died.)  The movie is about Alice and her family (her brother Lester played by Lucas Grabeel, and her father played by Luke Perry) who have just moved to a new city because their father purchased a music store there.

Alice is the new girl in 6th grade and doesn't have the best of luck, like her older brother does, making new friends and a perfect new life.  She gets the ""mean"" teacher, played by Penny Marshall, and learns life lessons along the way as her and her teacher grow closer.

Alice's mother had a beautiful singing voice, which must mean that Alice does too, right? Alice learns the answer while trying out for the lead part in the school musical.

The movie is entertaining with all of Alice's mis-adventures, but has a very real feel to it while it deals with real-life matters surrounding the loss of Alice's mother.  I even found myself in tears a couple of times!  While I enjoyed the movie, it definitely has some heavy life lessons in it.

I recommend this movie, as long as there are parents watching it with their kids, to help explain some of the lessons it teaches.

3176586,5,B00180OU7U,"I was expecting a goofy Disney movie but this is much better than that.  It's the type of movie you could let your 12-16 year old girl watch knowing she's getting a few life lessons included in the cost of entertainment.

The main character Alice McKinley (Alyson Stoner) is cast as a clumsy tomboy.  Having a ""normal"" main character instead of a pretty popular type makes the movie much more realistic and touching.  She falls, spills, and finds herself in embarrassing situations constantly.  Most teenage girls could relate to that.  Most of the movie has you hoping her character will find happiness.  That theme is the one that dominates.

Also influencing the plot is that the whole family suffers from the death of the mother.  There are a lot of touching issues revolving around that issue.  The dad is starting to date and Alice has emotions resulting from that as well.

Alice has teacher named Mrs. Plotkins who Alice does not like at first.  Mrs. Plotkins keeps helping and through the movie you want Alice to appreciate Mrs. Plotkins too.

In summary, you can't beat a movie that young teenage girls will love and parents will not mind watching too.",1217203200,,1162,4.75
3176587,5,B00180OU7U,"I watched ""Alice Upside Down"" with my 8.5-year-old daughter tonight and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. This is a perfect family movie, although it might be better suited for ages 8 and up since younger children may not relate to some of the issues faced by the central character. The story centers around sixth-grader Alice (Alyson Stoner) who reluctantly moves with her widower dad, Ben (Luke Perry) and older brother Lester (Lucas Grabeel) to another town. Although it has been six years since Alice's mother's death, it is obvious that Alice misses her mother's presence and so does Ben. Alice tries hard to fit in at school but finds that she can't seem to get anything right, stumbling along, making mistakes, and going through adolescent pangs.

Alice takes a shine to the theater teacher, the young and vivacious Miss Cole (Ashley Eckstein), and doesn't quite like her homeroom teacher Mrs. Plotkin (Penny Marshall) who is older and much more strict, but as the movie progresses Alice's experiences teach her mot to judge people by their appearances, and also comes to terms with her mother's death and improves the relationship with her father.

The themes explored in this movie will resonate with parents and young adults alike - loneliness/ alienation, grieving the loss of a loved one, adolescent angst, and many more. The main cast does an excellent job in his/her's respective roles, and there is no profanity or offensive language or mature content, so it makes for a great family movie. There is humor but it is on the whole a heartfelt drama that explores one young girl's coming to terms with who she is and how she develops a sense of self-identity and confidence. Recommended!",1372291200,,1726,4.86734693877551
3176588,4,B00180OU7U,I assume it was enjoyed. Sent as gift. Never heard back or if I did have no recall. It was highly recommend by a children's librarian,1356566400,,133,4.153846153846154
3176589,5,B00180OU7U,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, Alison Stoner did a great job. In the movie Alice feels like she's always messing up & cant do anything right. I can relate to her character, growing up I didn't have many friends, my mom passed away & in middle school boys teased me & girls picked on me, so I was kind of a loner. In the movie, anytime Alice didn't feel comfortable with herself or couldn't speak up she imagened herself as a whole different person, a person who was brave, talented & stood up for herself. I could also relate to that, anytime someone picked on me, instead of standing up to them i'd wait until they walked away & wished/imagened that I stood up to them. All & all this movie was good I gave it 5 stars.",1308614400,,726,4.23021582733813
3176590,3,B00180OU7U,"This had some cute moments, but there were a few times when I thought it wasn't age appropriate. It seems geared toward 6th graders. However, there were a few times when there were veiled references to sex (usually in relation to the older teenage brother or dad). Also, for most of the movie, Alice seems to be the exact opposite of a role model - sleeping during class, wanting to stay with the hot teacher, etc. Fortunately, the movie ends well. The relationship with Mrs. Plotkins was a nice twist - it's too seldom that teachers are portrayed as role models, especially older ones. I think for parents it's definitely worth watching this movie over once and making sure it's appropriate. It's probably fine for most kids, but there are some borderline situations.",1267228800,3,768,4.7819548872180455
3176591,4,B00180OU7U,"I just ordered this movie here on Amazon for my husband and myself to rewatch, and we are definitely not ""tweens.""

The character of Alice is so refreshing; she makes mistakes in ways that are human, not ""movie corny."" Even more surprising, she doesn't lie to get out of scrapes, she just walks headlong into them and experiences the consequences.

In fact, I found little about this movie actually corny - certainly none of the main characters were. Luke Perry played a great dad, the aunt was portrayed as meddling, but without causing any major blowups to reroute the focus of the story. The brother's role was small, but funny. Penny Marshall was just plain loveable. And Alice was definitely the star.",1252108800,,706,4.778688524590164
3176592,4,B00180OU7U,"Alice Upside Down is a ""tween"" movie starring Alyson Stoner (of Camp Rock fame) as Alison, Luke Grabeel (of the High School Musical franchise) as her popular, easygoing and supportive brother Lester, and the now paternal Luke Perry (from the original Beverly HIlls 90210) as her father, Ben.  Alice's life is turned Upside Down by a move to a new town, where she is the ""new girl"" in school, just trying to fit in.

This movie turned out better than I expected.  Alice does her best to fit in, and flashes between her real life, full of normal daily embarrassing moments that seem much worse than they are, and her fantasy world, where she is beautiful and popular, wears all the in-style clothes and is a fabulous singer.  Many of the situations she is in are not far from reality, and her fantasy life is not far off from what every 11 year old girl's fantasy life would be.  Because of this fresh realism, the movie was enjoyable to watch.  Granted, everything turned out perfect for Alice in the end and there was no chance of any true conflict (even her mother's death when Alice was 5 years old ends up being warm and fuzzy in the end).

I watched the movie with my six year old daughter and her seven year old friend.  They both gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up.  Even my eight year old son (who watched it just to keep the girls company, of course) enjoyed the movie.  I would watch it again.",1230940800,,1402,4.42023346303502
3176593,3,B00180OU7U,"Alice Down Under is a good flick for young teens (girls). Odds are the target adueince will enjoy it, and its good clean fun for the family.

This is something you can sit down and watch as a family and get some enjoyment out of it (though adults might find themselves slighlty bored at times).",1224115200,,294,4.345454545454546
3176594,3,B00180OU7U,"This is a sweet movie about Alice (Alyson Stoner) who moves to a new town and must make friends in a new middle school. Although Alice wants to be one of the cool girls in school her day dreams only land her in one embarrassing situation after another.

However, Alice learns during the course of the movie that appearances aren't everything and she finally begins to accept herself for who she is. She also helps her father (Luke Perry)to accept the loss of her mother and move along with his life.

I thought the movie was good and the actors played their parts well and would have given it 4 stars but my 9 year old, the prime target audience for this movie, asked me to dock another star for an oft repeated theme in tween movies. She said that although the story was ""cute"" it was ""too typical and predictable."" Hence my current 3 star rating.",1221696000,,848,4.3949044585987265
3176595,3,B00180OU7U,"Alice is an introspective 11-year-old girl struggling to deal with the awkwardness of growing up without a female role-model in her home. Having lost their mother years before, Alice and her teenage brother Lester are being raised by their father, Ben. Together, they've moved to a new town where Ben owns a music store and Alice will be starting junior high. The film takes us through Alice's first semester as a 6th grader as she deals with her constant feelings of inadequacy, making friends, her father's return to dating, a new teacher she idolizes and another she has misjudged.

""Alice Upside Down"" is, not surprisingly, based on a book series aimed at preteens and written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. The movie plays out just that way, too. It doesn't really tell a specific story, but rather follows the lead character through a portion of her life for the benefit of viewers who might relate to her feelings and experiences. For me, that works a bit better as a TV series than a movie. It CAN work for movies, but I think it would require more exciting experiences to do so. ""Alice Upside Down"" is successfully realistic (for the most part) and probably would work well for its very specific target audience of 6th grade girls, if they don't find it too drab, but I think as an overall ""family film"" it falls a little short, or at least wouldn't serve well for more than one viewing. To achieve the level of seriousness the film shoots for, it has to sacrifice the liveliness and cutesiness that made Lizzie McGuire (the series) so charming, so I'm not even sure most 11 and 12 year olds will be captivated by it. In addition, I just never found the lead character of Alice to be very likeable. At times she is a sympathetic character, but not really as often as she should be. Alice is a character who gets herself into trouble, and in the silliest ways, and though she is constantly embarrassing herself or being embarrassed by others, she never seems as believably mortified as the aforementioned Lizzie would, despite cowering a lot. And while I and surely others will appreciate that Alice is less snooty and sassy than most characters in kids' movies or shows, kids kind of are like that nowadays, so I'm not sure I'd say that adds to the realism any.

Disney Channel alumni Alyson Stoner and Lucas Grabeel star as Alice and her big brother Lester, Luke Perry (of TV's Beverly Hills 90210) plays their dad, Penny Marshall is the underappreciated Mrs. Plotkin, and Ashley Eckstein the adored and adorable Miss Cole. The acting is actually very good all around, though I have to be honest and say that Allyson Stoner doesn't really have the spark to draw me into her world. Not as bad as that dreadful young actress on Nickelodeon who can't seem to convey emotion (I'll let you guess who I'm talking about), but still not appealing enough for me to care for her Alice character in the moments that aren't tearjerkers over mother-loss or what have you. By the way, she does that thing where she talks directly to the audience in this film, and I really don't think it works here or is necessary at all. Lucas Grabeel does a pretty good job at playing the opposite of his High School Musical character here, and I'm sure both those Disney actors will draw loyal Disney Channel fans. I'm a little more old-school Disney myself, only liking a very small portion of what the channel currently runs. The highlight for male viewers in ""Alice Upside Down"" will undoubtedly be Ashley Eckstein, a gorgeous young actress whom I was surprised to see playing a teacher when I know she was very recently playing Disney Channel high school students herself, but I think she got those gigs with her very youthful appearance. She certainly gets the mouth watering in this film, but I've always enjoyed ogling her onscreen, even on Blue Collar TV. Definitely my favorite aspect of the movie.

Overall, ""Alice Upside Down"" is just an okay film, unless you are a girl in or around 6th grade who needs very little excitement or story. I realize it is intended to be a ""coming of age film"" as such, though more likely the first in what is hoping to be several, but I can't shake the feeling that it's just kind of TOO bland. The low-budget quality of the whole thing (something that is usually all the more evident in the music and how it is used), which looks to be lower than a Disney Channel movie's budget (probably much lower than the most recent ones), doesn't help much either. I also wasn't very big on the fantasy sequences, which felt a bit clunky in their presentation. If you or your kid is a fan of the book series though, that would surely add some excitement to seeing this film. Hey, I understand, I grew up with ""Superfudge"" and all that stuff (though I was more into ""Bunnicula"" myself). Who knows how the fans will like it though. From what little I've read about the book series (notably, one that has been praised for its coverage of the topic of sex, which makes the non-reader wonder just how the topic is handled in the books), there are some differences to be sure. The anamorphic widescreen DVD boasts a trailer, an interview with Alyson Stoner, an interview with Lucas Grabeel, and a little vid about Alice's costumes for the film. The interviews surely make nice little treats for the hardcore fans of the stars.",1221696000,,5332,4.622362869198312
3176596,4,B00180OU7U,"Alice upside down is a charming kids movie that parents will be able to watch along with their kids.  The movie stars Alyson Stoner as a misfit pre-teen moving to a new town and entering a new school.  Alyson deals with her insecurities by imagining that she is actually a ""cool"" girl.  The movie flashes into imaginary sequences where Stoner appears as she wishes to be seen - with cool clothes, witty comebacks and an entourage of friends.  These dream sequences contrast with Stoner's stumbles as a regular teen trying to fit in.  The acting is pretty good which makes the movie stomach-able for adults.  Stoner is really charming, her brother is believable and her father (played by Luke Perry) does a decent job in the role.  Penny Marshall appears also as a school teacher with an attitude.  Pre-teens will be satisfied by Alice Upside Down's charm and fun.",1221177600,,863,4.74496644295302
3176597,4,B00180OU7U,"Teen actress Alyson Stoner (Cheaper by the Dozen),  portrays Alice McKinley in ""Alice Upside Down,"" a young girl whose life is disrupted when her father moves her and her brother to a new town a few years after her mother has died. Luke Perry (Beverly Hills 90210) plays Alice's father, Ben McKinley, and Lucas Grabeel (High School Musical) plays her brother, Lester, in a movie that feels a lot like a Disney made-for-TV special. While most of Alice's problems stem from the fact that she has been struggling to figure out how best to behave like a lady without much in the way of a female role model since her mother died several years earlier, she is also unusually challenged by innate clumsiness and tone deafness.

The joy of watching Alice come to terms with each setback and embarrassment is what makes ""Alice Upside Down"" most fun, and young girls will enjoy the vicarious thrill of seeing someone so smart and pretty bumbling through the kinds of situations that most of us run into much more than we'd like in adolescence. Some of the issues dealt with in ""Alice Upside Down"" feel heavy at times, as Alice confronts her father about his difficulty integrating poignant memories of the past (in the form of old home movies and pictures of his wife) with the new life he's building in the new house and town.

While the main story line of how Alice can develop her sense of identity in a new town even when things seem to keep going wrong is fairly good, there are some choppy aspects to ""Alice Upside Down.""  The movie's frequent use of voice-over narrative in which Alice looks and speaks directly to the camera kept reminding me that this is ""just a movie,"" and the character development seemed a bit flat and two-dimensional. I would have loved to know more about the other characters than this movie showed... such as why Alice's dad started dating and then suddenly stopped, for example.

One of the strong points of ""Alice Upside Down"" is that the actors are fabulous and the cast is strong enough to really hold viewer interest, so even predictable plot development and a made-for-TV vibe didn't dissuade me from watching the movie all the way through to the end. I really loved seeing Penny Marshall playing the role of Mrs. Plotkin, Alice's teacher, and I loved the heart-warming ending of the film in which Alice gained an appreciation for true friends in unexpected places.

I recommend this movie for fans of Alyson Stoner, Luke Perry, Lucas Grabeel, and Penny Marshall... and young girls who can handle a movie that deals with serious issues of mortality (death and illness).",1220745600,,2598,4.7240618101545255

It's about a girl named Alice at a new school. Her brother and her dad don't understand her and her mother is no longer living. She feels the need for a mother figure, or at least someone cool to help her be more fashionable. It's a mostly believable plot line with some cute soliloquies thrown in here and there. I usually disdain this sort of twaddle because invariably Hollywood loves to make the dad look like an idiot. This new attack on fatherhood is offensive to our family views. But, Alice Upside Down does not attack dad. Actually, dad is a likable kind of guy that you really feel for. He's trying to raise his kids without a mom around. The story is pretty cute and has some humorous moments, great for around ages 8-12 set. My 13 and 15-year-old even enjoyed it (though my kids are a little less jaded than the average. They aren't allowed to watch R movies and Pg only after we have previewed them).

The only criticism I had was that not one character in the whole movie ever thought of helping Alice learn to comb her hair. Oh well. You can't have everything. All in all, good G rated stuff for kids.",1219881600,,1276,4.383966244725738
3176600,4,B00180OU7U,"ASIN B00180OU7U - I'm not much of a movie fan and am always more likely to choose a Disney flick than anything else.  Alice Upside Down sounded like a good fit for me and the fact that it's tied to a book series is an added attraction.  I watched it with a nine year old girl, just in case there were things I was simply too old to understand; besides, watching kids' movies with kids is always more amusing.

Alice is in middle school, which is a pretty insecure place to be to begin with - it's made worse by the fact that she seems to be compiling a stunning list of embarrassing moments and she's got THE nightmare homeroom teacher in Mrs. Plotkin.  From the first day, things are not looking good and Alice copes by living a rich fantasy life in which she is, of course, popular - and not at all the embarrassing moments queen she seems to feel destined to be.

Moms will probably enjoy getting to see Luke Perry... or maybe it'll make them feel suddenly old.  I think the casting there was great, since most parents of 11 year old girls now were close to that age when Perry was at the height of his heart-throbbiness; it's hard to watch the movie and not remember who you were back then, making it easy to relate to Alice and, through her, to your own daughter.  Unlike many currently and recently popular movies for the age group, where kids lack manners, have a tendency to spew swear words as if they were born truck drivers, and the stories tend to revolve around more grown-up themes, Alice Upside Down strikes me as a realistic look at the life of a middle school aged girl who's going to turn out fine - if she doesn't just die of embarrassment first.

My nine year old viewing companion absolutely loved the movie and thinks my 4 stars is insufficient.  (I'm taking one away because DVDs usually come with some good ""extras"" and I'm not seeing that here.)  She hadn't read any Alice books, but she's eager to now - a major positive!  Any movie that leads a kid to put their nose in a book is a fine thing.

All of Alice's suffering is made worse by her assignment to the absolutely ""worst"" 6th grade teacher, Mrs. Plotkin (played by the fabulous Penny Marshall.)  Why couldn't she have gotten the really cool teacher with the great hair and clothes who just seems to be her students' best friend?

Ultimately, there are some great lessons learned in Alice Upside Down, and Alice learns to get past her superficial evaluations of what is important and move into a brighter and happier world!

I highly recommend this cute film for the younger crowd. Older teens may feel they are too sophisticated for this DVD. Parents will be happy to find a film that families can watch together that is thoroughly entertaining, but also provides wonderful subject matter for later discussion.",1219795200,,1214,4.794258373205742
3176603,4,B00180OU7U,"Alice (Camp Rock's Alyson Stoner) moved to a new town  with Her Dad (90210's Luke Perry) and her brother Lester (High School Musical's Lucas Grabeel). Being a new kid in a new area is hard. Being an independant person is harder.

She in her own mind is the coolest kid in school, however in reality she is off center, off key and strange to most. Can she fit in is the point.

Lead by her new english teacher (Penny Marshall, in one the best roles she has had in years), she teaches Alice. And Alice learns she is special even when her world sometime is upsidedown to many.

This is a cute film, similar to ones  that  Disney Channel runs. One would hope another film comes soon, this small film is one of those films that you don't need special effects to pull on your heart string with good old fashion family values. The humor and warmth is there and the cast is good.

To watch and enjoy this film, You just need a heart to watch and an open mind to what a family film really is.

I would wish there was a commentary, would love a director or cast insight..but alas like alice, this cool feature isn't on this production

3176604,5,B00180OU7U,"Alice Upside Down is a great book series for children. The movie was really good as well. It stars Alison Stoner of Camp Rock and Lucas Grabeel of the High School Musical Movies.

Basically the story is about a young girl about 12, who lost her mother at a young age. She has had to grow up with only men around, therefore she is more tomboyish. She longs to be sylish, as in where super cute clothes, and to be popular and fit in. She can't sing, but trys out for the school musical to be close to the ultra pretty new teacher.

Along the way, Alice learns about herself and that being coll and popular isn;t all what it's cracked up to be. She finds her place and gains some slef esteem.

This is a great family movie, and perfect for girls 8-13. I recommend it.",1219104000,,764,4.183673469387755
3176605,4,B00180OU7U,"Ever since I have had a home theatre system in my basement, I always look for a movie that all of my family members truly enjoy.  Other than some great animation films, such as the ones from Pixar (Finding Nemo, Cars, Toy Story etc.), it is not easy to find a movie that all of my family are satisfied with. And I can say that this movie is the one I have been looking for.

  This film has a story about a girl that moves to a new town, meets new friends, and tries to find a her way to be happy.  Pretty familiar story, right?  Of course there is a story with a boy and the jealousy she runs into.  When I watch the first 15 mins of the movie, I could expect what the rest of the story will be.  Yes, I was right and the movie went as I expected to be. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the acting and flow of the movie.  I really enjoyed the movie and my 8 year old daughter really liked it.  There are parts that my daughter watches over and over and laughs every time.  Alyson Stoner, who I did not know before, did a great job acting Alice and it is fun to see Penny Marshall, who I remember more as a director than an actress, as a thoughtful teacher. It is also interesting to see Luke Perry as a careful dad, instead of a sexy bad boy that I have always remembered.

  One thing I should note is that this DVD does not have any subtitles.  If you are like me whose native tongue is not English, you might not catch all the words in the movie. However, even without subtitles, I do not have any problems and do not think I missed any bit of the movie. The message is universal and the acting shows everything.

  I heartly recommend this movie for your family movie night.",1218585600,,1685,4.054545454545455
3176606,4,B00180OU7U,"I anticipated this movie to be around the same age-level as High School Musical.  It was not.  I think this movie, while very well acted, is really for kids ages 11 and over.  There is too much thinking, understanding, brattiness etc... that goes over the heads of younger ones.  I watched it with two 7 year old girls and one 8 year old boy and felt that it was a few years too early for them to be watching it.  Kids kissing, boy rock band with no shirts, very mean girls - it just didn't feel right to watch it with them.  I am not an overbearing mom by any means but I would think twice before letting any kids under 5th grade watch this movie.

That all said, Alyson Stoner is such a cute and wonderful actress and played the part of Alice perfectly.  Same with Lucas Grabeel, her brother, who is the total opposite of his High School Musical character.  Luke Perry didn't have much of a part and he was just okay.  It was very nice to see Penny Marshall playing a part instead of behind the scenes.  She did a spot on job of playing the ""mean"" teacher in school and how she is misunderstood.

So overall I think it is a very good well acted movie for kids over 10 years old.  The problem is, it isn't a movie kids will want to watch over and over again.  It has lessons to be told but it lacks music, adventure, dancing and lots of comedy that keeps kids watching over and over again.  I would recommend renting it before buying.",1218153600,,1435,4.186131386861314

But many of those films also suffer from a distinct lack of anything resembling reality, so the target audience often finds the lessons lost or muddled in between all the flash and fantasy. Not so with this one. The lead performers all look and (more often than not) act ""real"".

It is set in middle school but is appropriate for as young as 8 and probably up to 12 or 13.  Alice's Mom had died and that is why she is living with her father and older brother.  The relationships focused on are between parent and child and between teacher and student.  The relationships between the students are very platonic although there are some minor hints of a boy being cute and a bit of the gossipy teen stuff but not much.  This is all treated very lightly.

3176610,4,B00180OU7U,"With so many videos out with violence, raw language, and adult situations, it is hard to find a good family film.
This one FITS THE BILL
Everyone is awkward at that age. EVERYONE. Now, I haven't been that age for over 25 years, AND my only gripe that prevented this from getting 5 of 5 stars is, MOST kids when they lose a parent as a baby don't miss them the way she is portrayed missing her mother. Kids are pretty resilient, and this film has her crying and missing her mom like it happened last month, NOT when she was a baby. Also, another gripe with the mother character is ALL the acting in this film is fine. EXCEPT the deceased mother. Yeah, you'ld think playing the role of a dead person would be a breeze for most, but she simply tries too hard, and the acting, is well, quite overacted. The GOOD news, is her segments are short, and you won't be subjected to too much of the overacted acting. (When you see it, you will be magically whisked away to a high school musical, with very bad overacted scenes...) I'd think just KNOWING her mother died and her father was a widower would have been enough information for the viewer. If they edited all the ""mom"" and ""missing mom"" scenes out, this film would be fine, as you pretty much get she has no mom during the first scene. Those other additions were kind of creepy to me, to see a child so obscessed with a person she never really knew.
Those scenes truly weren't needed to feel her need to bond with a female figure, like her teachers. AND, a valuable lesson is learned, pretty packages aren't all they are wrapped up to be, the best person for her might not be the pretty package, but the one with the plain brown wrapper. I'll leave the movie watching to you to see that, another valuable lesson!
I LOVED the music, and wasn't bored once. I even had to snicker a time or two, perhaps she DID remind me of myself at that age. And even if you never were an awkward preteen, the self doubts she feels I'm sure were felt by everyone.
Now, kids that age in my junior high school weren't so kind and forgiving. There was a lot of maturity in the conversations of these preteens. In real life, when true jealousy occurs, there is bound to be some name calling and rarely forgiveness. But this movie lacks the name calling, and is full of forgiveness. THAT is why I found it a breath of fresh air. In real life, and outcast is an outcast, and they usually need therapy by the time they are 30. In this movie, an outcast is accepted, and befriended. So, maybe not true to real life, but true in the sense that it is the way things SHOULD be.
I'm going to share this video with family and friends with preteens. I feel it has a message and a story that needs to be shared!
So, buy this movie, pop some popcorn, and set aside some GOOD family time, as this is a WONDERFUL family movie.",1218067200,,2838,4.267161410018553
3176611,2,B00180OU7U,"I thought the father was miscast and the editing could have been tighter to produce a shorter film. The rest of the cast seemed well selected and it was a pleasant surprise to see Penny Marshall acting again. The storyline seemed more like a made for TV show sit-com. I think the premise of adjusting to a mother's death and then adjusting to a new school district was worthy, but there was no real depth given to any area. If I were a pre-adolescent then perhaps I would have enjoyed it more.",1218067200,,493,4.369565217391305
3176612,3,B00180OU7U,"While some of the dialogue and situations seemed to be contrived to fit the teenage experience (the awkwardness of meeting someone, the mean or ""cool"" teacher, etc) , the best elements of the film were the acting of Alyson Stoner (who plays Alice) and the moments between Alice and her family.

 The experience of being a teenager and the difficulties of having to pick up and move to a new place or a new school without any friends is something that many teens have to deal with, so it is good how they handle this theme. Alice spends part of the time bumbling through real experiences, part of the time imagining a better outcome, and part of the time narrating her frustrations with an aside to the audience. What she comes to realize is that we all have ""growing pains"" that we have to deal with, and to look for others who will support her through these tough times.

The film also focuses on the father's (played by Luke Perry) issues, such as learning how to raise kids on his own. He wants to be a good father, but sometimes isn't sure what the right answer is, and has to struggle through this.

While this is a clean family movie, it is probably best suited for the younger kids. It isn't above average filmmaking here, but Alice Upside Down has some important morals that hit close to home, and they do a nice job presenting these.",1217894400,,1342,4.443089430894309
3176613,4,B00180OU7U,"Faced with the challenges of a sixth grade girl growing up with the complication of having lost her mother at an early age, the film revolves around the school-centric experience. Things are further complicated for Alice because her father, played by Luke Perry, purchases an out of town music store forcing a family move. Everything seems to be working against her, hence the title, ""Upside Down"". Even the teacher she was given Mrs. Plotkin played by Penny Marshall was considered to be the mean teacher, and something to be avoided.  The school play tryout was a disaster.
I can't reflect on the movie any deeper than that, otherwise I would be giving away the ending.  I think that the moral of the movie is that when you think that your world is falling apart, and you are the most unpopular person, it really is a faade, and given a chance, support and friendship can come from the most unexpected places.",1217721600,,911,4.6875

I love this movie and recomend it. Brought back some memories from my jr high years. This is the first in a series of direct to video Alice movies based on the books of the same title.

Alyson Stoner does a very good job of acting in this film. Some may remember her from Mikes super short show and Suite life of Zack and Cody.
She also guest stared on an ep of Thats So Raven.

In the above series her characters were out going in Alice(She plays Alice) the character is subdued compaired to the above. She plays the subdued Alice great, which shows off her range of acting she can do.
Her best scene is at the end when she is crying while talking to her dad.
You can see real tears. One of the few actresses that pulls off a scene like that so convinceingly.

Lucas Grabeel from High School Musical plays Alices brother.

Alice is a girl where everything she does seems to go wrong.
To borrow a phrase ""If it weren't for bad luck she would have no luck at all.""

If that weren't enough her mom died a few years early and they have moved recently to a new house away from eveything she new. She falls on her face
fitting in the first day at her new school. The girl across the street does however give her a change at school after there first meeting as they were moving in seemingly taking an instant dislike to Alice.

In the end things start to work out. I like that its not a she lives happy every after ending. In the next films she will not dought face new problems to work out.

This is sort of Lizzie Mcquireish that we see what she is thinking live action not cartoon. The tone of the film is Nickelodeon. Would be a good network for it to air on.

Start collecting these films. Good store, Good lessons, Good acting.

Oh there is soundtrack avalable for this movie. Alyson sings two songs.
One a solo, and one a duet. Lost and Found and Free Spirit. You can get the soundtrack with the movie in a double pack but only at Walmart. They should do a normal release of the Soundtrack.  The soundtrack is not avalable seprately.",1217548800,3,2105,4.2375
3411078,4,B00180OU7U,"This drama is based on the story of Phyllis Reynolds Naylor that shows the growing pains of a teenager named Alice McKinley (Alyson Stoner.) Strongly supported by the fine performance of Penny Marshall as Mrs. Plotkin and Luke Perry as Ben McKinley, the movie depicts the sad and painful years of a teenager who lost her mother when she was five. Her father Ben is of little help since he is still in a state sadness after losing his wife. Adjusting to the life of widower and bringing up two children on his own is a little too much for him. In the meantime Alice learns to live in a fantasy world with vivid imagination to keep her happy. With some help from her teacher Mrs. Plotkin, she learns to be less judgmental in life and grows to a reasonable young woman. The movie shows a contrasting life of her big brother Lester (Lucas Grabeel) who seems to have a normal life and even popular among girls. The movie shows the vulnerability of growing young woman without her mother, but apparently has lesser impact on a boy. Alice Stoner offers a brilliant performance in this excellent family drama: Highly recommended for family viewing.

When her father (Luke Perry) turns Alice's life upside down by moving her and her aspiring-rock-star brother (Lucas Grabeel) to a new town, Alice soon discovers she isn't the fashionable and cool girl she wishes she were. Her teacher is the strict Mrs. Plotkin (Penny Marshall), and not the beautiful, sweet and seemingly perfect Miss Cole. And the leading role in the school musical she wants so badly . . . Well, maybe it's not for her.

But Alice soon discovers that sometimes it takes getting your life turned upside down for you to discover what's most important and who you really are.

""Alice Upside Down"" is funny and charming. It starts slowly, but in the end it evokes both laughter and tears. Penny Marshall is particularly wonderful as the strict Mrs. Plotkin, who has more to teach Alice than Alice can know at first glance. This is a charming film for tween girls, and it is surprisingly watchable for their moms as well.

This isn't a big screen blockbuster. This is a sweet film, which has more in common with an after school special, ""Harriet the Spy"" or ""Little Secrets"" than ""Bridge to Terabithia"" or even ""Akeelah and the Bee.""

After the death of her mother, Alice is uprooted by father Ben and moved to a new town, school, teacher's friends and all that goes with it amidst her adolescent angst and tumultuous throws of simply being a teenager.
Her shyness and isolation leads her to live out her dreams in vivid fantasies that often get her into tricky (and often funny) situations.
That pretty much sums up the picture; it's fairly predictable as we watch her interactions and growth but gladly without being too sickly sweet.
A genial cast including the likes of Luke Perry and Penny Marshall as the (almost sinister) teacher Mrs. Plotkin, help the story along and give it a well rounded family appeal.
As long as you accept the intentions of the movie to appeal almost singularly to its targeted viewers you will enjoy it, although for me there wasn't enough breadth or character embellishment to covet a wider audience.
Overall 4 stars for some believable and solid acting performances from the young cast. Not my particular kind of movie, but a nice (and fairly safe) viewing time with the family.",1217376000,,1305,4.830357142857143

The movie is about Alice and her family (her brother Lester played by Lucas Grabeel, and her father played by Luke Perry) who have just moved to a new city because their father purchased a music store there.

Alice is the new girl in 6th grade and doesn't have the best of luck, like her older brother does, making new friends and a perfect new life.  She gets the ""mean"" teacher, played by Penny Marshall, and learns life lessons along the way as her and her teacher grow closer.

Alice's mother had a beautiful singing voice, which must mean that Alice does too, right? Alice learns the answer while trying out for the lead part in the school musical.

The movie is entertaining with all of Alice's mis-adventures, but has a very real feel to it while it deals with real-life matters surrounding the loss of Alice's mother.  I even found myself in tears a couple of times!  While I enjoyed the movie, it definitely has some heavy life lessons in it.

I recommend this movie, as long as there are parents watching it with their kids, to help explain some of the lessons it teaches.

3411083,5,B00180OU7U,"I was expecting a goofy Disney movie but this is much better than that.  It's the type of movie you could let your 12-16 year old girl watch knowing she's getting a few life lessons included in the cost of entertainment.

The main character Alice McKinley (Alyson Stoner) is cast as a clumsy tomboy.  Having a ""normal"" main character instead of a pretty popular type makes the movie much more realistic and touching.  She falls, spills, and finds herself in embarrassing situations constantly.  Most teenage girls could relate to that.  Most of the movie has you hoping her character will find happiness.  That theme is the one that dominates.

Also influencing the plot is that the whole family suffers from the death of the mother.  There are a lot of touching issues revolving around that issue.  The dad is starting to date and Alice has emotions resulting from that as well.

Alice has teacher named Mrs. Plotkins who Alice does not like at first.  Mrs. Plotkins keeps helping and through the movie you want Alice to appreciate Mrs. Plotkins too.

In summary, you can't beat a movie that young teenage girls will love and parents will not mind watching too.",1217203200,,1162,4.75
3411084,5,B00180OU7U,"I watched ""Alice Upside Down"" with my 8.5-year-old daughter tonight and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. This is a perfect family movie, although it might be better suited for ages 8 and up since younger children may not relate to some of the issues faced by the central character. The story centers around sixth-grader Alice (Alyson Stoner) who reluctantly moves with her widower dad, Ben (Luke Perry) and older brother Lester (Lucas Grabeel) to another town. Although it has been six years since Alice's mother's death, it is obvious that Alice misses her mother's presence and so does Ben. Alice tries hard to fit in at school but finds that she can't seem to get anything right, stumbling along, making mistakes, and going through adolescent pangs.

Alice takes a shine to the theater teacher, the young and vivacious Miss Cole (Ashley Eckstein), and doesn't quite like her homeroom teacher Mrs. Plotkin (Penny Marshall) who is older and much more strict, but as the movie progresses Alice's experiences teach her mot to judge people by their appearances, and also comes to terms with her mother's death and improves the relationship with her father.

The themes explored in this movie will resonate with parents and young adults alike - loneliness/ alienation, grieving the loss of a loved one, adolescent angst, and many more. The main cast does an excellent job in his/her's respective roles, and there is no profanity or offensive language or mature content, so it makes for a great family movie. There is humor but it is on the whole a heartfelt drama that explores one young girl's coming to terms with who she is and how she develops a sense of self-identity and confidence.

3411086,5,B00180OU7U,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, Alison Stoner did a great job. In the movie Alice feels like she's always messing up & cant do anything right. I can relate to her character, growing up I didn't have many friends, my mom passed away & in middle school boys teased me & girls picked on me, so I was kind of a loner. In the movie, anytime Alice didn't feel comfortable with herself or couldn't speak up she imagened herself as a whole different person, a person who was brave, talented & stood up for herself. I could also relate to that, anytime someone picked on me, instead of standing up to them i'd wait until they walked away & wished/imagened that I stood up to them.

However, there were a few times when there were veiled references to sex (usually in relation to the older teenage brother or dad). Also, for most of the movie, Alice seems to be the exact opposite of a role model - sleeping during class, wanting to stay with the hot teacher, etc. Fortunately, the movie ends well. The relationship with Mrs. Plotkins was a nice twist - it's too seldom that teachers are portrayed as role models, especially older ones. I think for parents it's definitely worth watching this movie over once and making sure it's appropriate.

The character of Alice is so refreshing; she makes mistakes in ways that are human, not ""movie corny."" Even more surprising, she doesn't lie to get out of scrapes, she just walks headlong into them and experiences the consequences.

In fact, I found little about this movie actually corny - certainly none of the main characters were. Luke Perry played a great dad, the aunt was portrayed as meddling, but without causing any major blowups to reroute the focus of the story. The brother's role was small, but funny.

3411089,4,B00180OU7U,"Alice Upside Down is a ""tween"" movie starring Alyson Stoner (of Camp Rock fame) as Alison, Luke Grabeel (of the High School Musical franchise) as her popular, easygoing and supportive brother Lester, and the now paternal Luke Perry (from the original Beverly HIlls 90210) as her father, Ben.  Alice's life is turned Upside Down by a move to a new town, where she is the ""new girl"" in school, just trying to fit in.

This movie turned out better than I expected.  Alice does her best to fit in, and flashes between her real life, full of normal daily embarrassing moments that seem much worse than they are, and her fantasy world, where she is beautiful and popular, wears all the in-style clothes and is a fabulous singer.  Many of the situations she is in are not far from reality, and her fantasy life is not far off from what every 11 year old girl's fantasy life would be.  Because of this fresh realism, the movie was enjoyable to watch.  Granted, everything turned out perfect for Alice in the end and there was no chance of any true conflict (even her mother's death when Alice was 5 years old ends up being warm and fuzzy in the end).

I watched the movie with my six year old daughter and her seven year old friend.  They both gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up.  Even my eight year old son (who watched it just to keep the girls company, of course) enjoyed the movie.  I would watch it again.",1230940800,,1402,4.42023346303502

3411092,3,B00180OU7U,"Alice is an introspective 11-year-old girl struggling to deal with the awkwardness of growing up without a female role-model in her home. Having lost their mother years before, Alice and her teenage brother Lester are being raised by their father, Ben. Together, they've moved to a new town where Ben owns a music store and Alice will be starting junior high. The film takes us through Alice's first semester as a 6th grader as she deals with her constant feelings of inadequacy, making friends, her father's return to dating, a new teacher she idolizes and another she has misjudged.

""Alice Upside Down"" is, not surprisingly, based on a book series aimed at preteens and written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. The movie plays out just that way, too. It doesn't really tell a specific story, but rather follows the lead character through a portion of her life for the benefit of viewers who might relate to her feelings and experiences. For me, that works a bit better as a TV series than a movie. It CAN work for movies, but I think it would require more exciting experiences to do so. ""Alice Upside Down"" is successfully realistic (for the most part) and probably would work well for its very specific target audience of 6th grade girls, if they don't find it too drab, but I think as an overall ""family film"" it falls a little short, or at least wouldn't serve well for more than one viewing. To achieve the level of seriousness the film shoots for, it has to sacrifice the liveliness and cutesiness that made Lizzie McGuire (the series) so charming, so I'm not even sure most 11 and 12 year olds will be captivated by it. In addition, I just never found the lead character of Alice to be very likeable. At times she is a sympathetic character, but not really as often as she should be. Alice is a character who gets herself into trouble, and in the silliest ways, and though she is constantly embarrassing herself or being embarrassed by others, she never seems as believably mortified as the aforementioned Lizzie would, despite cowering a lot. And while I and surely others will appreciate that Alice is less snooty and sassy than most characters in kids' movies or shows, kids kind of are like that nowadays, so I'm not sure I'd say that adds to the realism any.

Disney Channel alumni Alyson Stoner and Lucas Grabeel star as Alice and her big brother Lester, Luke Perry (of TV's Beverly Hills 90210) plays their dad, Penny Marshall is the underappreciated Mrs. Plotkin, and Ashley Eckstein the adored and adorable Miss Cole. The acting is actually very good all around, though I have to be honest and say that Allyson Stoner doesn't really have the spark to draw me into her world. Not as bad as that dreadful young actress on Nickelodeon who can't seem to convey emotion (I'll let you guess who I'm talking about), but still not appealing enough for me to care for her Alice character in the moments that aren't tearjerkers over mother-loss or what have you. By the way, she does that thing where she talks directly to the audience in this film, and I really don't think it works here or is necessary at all. Lucas Grabeel does a pretty good job at playing the opposite of his High School Musical character here, and I'm sure both those Disney actors will draw loyal Disney Channel fans. I'm a little more old-school Disney myself, only liking a very small portion of what the channel currently runs. The highlight for male viewers in ""Alice Upside Down"" will undoubtedly be Ashley Eckstein, a gorgeous young actress whom I was surprised to see playing a teacher when I know she was very recently playing Disney Channel high school students herself, but I think she got those gigs with her very youthful appearance. She certainly gets the mouth watering in this film, but I've always enjoyed ogling her onscreen, even on Blue Collar TV. Definitely my favorite aspect of the movie.

Overall, ""Alice Upside Down"" is just an okay film, unless you are a girl in or around 6th grade who needs very little excitement or story. I realize it is intended to be a ""coming of age film"" as such, though more likely the first in what is hoping to be several, but I can't shake the feeling that it's just kind of TOO bland. The low-budget quality of the whole thing (something that is usually all the more evident in the music and how it is used), which looks to be lower than a Disney Channel movie's budget (probably much lower than the most recent ones), doesn't help much either. I also wasn't very big on the fantasy sequences, which felt a bit clunky in their presentation. If you or your kid is a fan of the book series though, that would surely add some excitement to seeing this film. Hey, I understand, I grew up with ""Superfudge"" and all that stuff (though I was more into ""Bunnicula"" myself). Who knows how the fans will like it though. From what little I've read about the book series (notably, one that has been praised for its coverage of the topic of sex, which makes the non-reader wonder just how the topic is handled in the books), there are some differences to be sure. The anamorphic widescreen DVD boasts a trailer, an interview with Alyson Stoner, an interview with Lucas Grabeel, and a little vid about Alice's costumes for the film. The interviews surely make nice little treats for the hardcore fans of the stars.",1221696000,,5332,4.622362869198312

The movie flashes into imaginary sequences where Stoner appears as she wishes to be seen - with cool clothes, witty comebacks and an entourage of friends.  These dream sequences contrast with Stoner's stumbles as a regular teen trying to fit in.  The acting is pretty good which makes the movie stomach-able for adults.  Stoner is really charming, her brother is believable and her father (played by Luke Perry) does a decent job in the role.  Penny Marshall appears also as a school teacher with an attitude.

3411094,4,B00180OU7U,"Teen actress Alyson Stoner (Cheaper by the Dozen),  portrays Alice McKinley in ""Alice Upside Down,"" a young girl whose life is disrupted when her father moves her and her brother to a new town a few years after her mother has died. Luke Perry (Beverly Hills 90210) plays Alice's father, Ben McKinley, and Lucas Grabeel (High School Musical) plays her brother, Lester, in a movie that feels a lot like a Disney made-for-TV special. While most of Alice's problems stem from the fact that she has been struggling to figure out how best to behave like a lady without much in the way of a female role model since her mother died several years earlier, she is also unusually challenged by innate clumsiness and tone deafness.

The joy of watching Alice come to terms with each setback and embarrassment is what makes ""Alice Upside Down"" most fun, and young girls will enjoy the vicarious thrill of seeing someone so smart and pretty bumbling through the kinds of situations that most of us run into much more than we'd like in adolescence. Some of the issues dealt with in ""Alice Upside Down"" feel heavy at times, as Alice confronts her father about his difficulty integrating poignant memories of the past (in the form of old home movies and pictures of his wife) with the new life he's building in the new house and town.

While the main story line of how Alice can develop her sense of identity in a new town even when things seem to keep going wrong is fairly good, there are some choppy aspects to ""Alice Upside Down.""  The movie's frequent use of voice-over narrative in which Alice looks and speaks directly to the camera kept reminding me that this is ""just a movie,"" and the character development seemed a bit flat and two-dimensional. I would have loved to know more about the other characters than this movie showed... such as why Alice's dad started dating and then suddenly stopped, for example.

One of the strong points of ""Alice Upside Down"" is that the actors are fabulous and the cast is strong enough to really hold viewer interest, so even predictable plot development and a made-for-TV vibe didn't dissuade me from watching the movie all the way through to the end. I really loved seeing Penny Marshall playing the role of Mrs. Plotkin, Alice's teacher, and I loved the heart-warming ending of the film in which Alice gained an appreciation for true friends in unexpected places.

I recommend this movie for fans of Alyson Stoner, Luke Perry, Lucas Grabeel, and Penny Marshall... and young girls who can handle a movie that deals with serious issues of mortality (death and illness).",1220745600,,2598,4.7240618101545255

She feels the need for a mother figure, or at least someone cool to help her be more fashionable. It's a mostly believable plot line with some cute soliloquies thrown in here and there. I usually disdain this sort of twaddle because invariably Hollywood loves to make the dad look like an idiot. This new attack on fatherhood is offensive to our family views. But, Alice Upside Down does not attack dad. Actually, dad is a likable kind of guy that you really feel for. He's trying to raise his kids without a mom around. The story is pretty cute and has some humorous moments, great for around ages 8-12 set. My 13 and 15-year-old even enjoyed it (though my kids are a little less jaded than the average. They aren't allowed to watch R movies and Pg only after we have previewed them).

3411097,4,B00180OU7U,"ASIN B00180OU7U - I'm not much of a movie fan and am always more likely to choose a Disney flick than anything else.  Alice Upside Down sounded like a good fit for me and the fact that it's tied to a book series is an added attraction.  I watched it with a nine year old girl, just in case there were things I was simply too old to understand; besides, watching kids' movies with kids is always more amusing.

Alice is in middle school, which is a pretty insecure place to be to begin with - it's made worse by the fact that she seems to be compiling a stunning list of embarrassing moments and she's got THE nightmare homeroom teacher in Mrs. Plotkin.  From the first day, things are not looking good and Alice copes by living a rich fantasy life in which she is, of course, popular - and not at all the embarrassing moments queen she seems to feel destined to be.

Moms will probably enjoy getting to see Luke Perry... or maybe it'll make them feel suddenly old.  I think the casting there was great, since most parents of 11 year old girls now were close to that age when Perry was at the height of his heart-throbbiness; it's hard to watch the movie and not remember who you were back then, making it easy to relate to Alice and, through her, to your own daughter.  Unlike many currently and recently popular movies for the age group, where kids lack manners, have a tendency to spew swear words as if they were born truck drivers, and the stories tend to revolve around more grown-up themes, Alice Upside Down strikes me as a realistic look at the life of a middle school aged girl who's going to turn out fine - if she doesn't just die of embarrassment first.

My nine year old viewing companion absolutely loved the movie and thinks my 4 stars is insufficient.  (I'm taking one away because DVDs usually come with some good ""extras"" and I'm not seeing that here.)  She hadn't read any Alice books, but she's eager to now - a major positive!  Any movie that leads a kid to put their nose in a book is a fine thing.

All of Alice's suffering is made worse by her assignment to the absolutely ""worst"" 6th grade teacher, Mrs. Plotkin (played by the fabulous Penny Marshall.)  Why couldn't she have gotten the really cool teacher with the great hair and clothes who just seems to be her students' best friend?

Ultimately, there are some great lessons learned in Alice Upside Down, and Alice learns to get past her superficial evaluations of what is important and move into a brighter and happier world!

Other than some great animation films, such as the ones from Pixar (Finding Nemo, Cars, Toy Story etc.), it is not easy to find a movie that all of my family are satisfied with. And I can say that this movie is the one I have been looking for.

  This film has a story about a girl that moves to a new town, meets new friends, and tries to find a her way to be happy.  Pretty familiar story, right?  Of course there is a story with a boy and the jealousy she runs into.  When I watch the first 15 mins of the movie, I could expect what the rest of the story will be.  Yes, I was right and the movie went as I expected to be. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the acting and flow of the movie.  I really enjoyed the movie and my 8 year old daughter really liked it.  There are parts that my daughter watches over and over and laughs every time.  Alyson Stoner, who I did not know before, did a great job acting Alice and it is fun to see Penny Marshall, who I remember more as a director than an actress, as a thoughtful teacher. It is also interesting to see Luke Perry as a careful dad, instead of a sexy bad boy that I have always remembered.

  One thing I should note is that this DVD does not have any subtitles.  If you are like me whose native tongue is not English, you might not catch all the words in the movie.

There is too much thinking, understanding, brattiness etc... that goes over the heads of younger ones.  I watched it with two 7 year old girls and one 8 year old boy and felt that it was a few years too early for them to be watching it.  Kids kissing, boy rock band with no shirts, very mean girls - it just didn't feel right to watch it with them.  I am not an overbearing mom by any means but I would think twice before letting any kids under 5th grade watch this movie.

That all said, Alyson Stoner is such a cute and wonderful actress and played the part of Alice perfectly.  Same with Lucas Grabeel, her brother, who is the total opposite of his High School Musical character.  Luke Perry didn't have much of a part and he was just okay.  It was very nice to see Penny Marshall playing a part instead of behind the scenes.  She did a spot on job of playing the ""mean"" teacher in school and how she is misunderstood.

So overall I think it is a very good well acted movie for kids over 10 years old.  The problem is, it isn't a movie kids will want to watch over and over again.  It has lessons to be told but it lacks music, adventure, dancing and lots of comedy that keeps kids watching over and over again.

The relationships focused on are between parent and child and between teacher and student.

This one FITS THE BILL
Everyone is awkward at that age. EVERYONE. Now, I haven't been that age for over 25 years, AND my only gripe that prevented this from getting 5 of 5 stars is, MOST kids when they lose a parent as a baby don't miss them the way she is portrayed missing her mother. Kids are pretty resilient, and this film has her crying and missing her mom like it happened last month, NOT when she was a baby. Also, another gripe with the mother character is ALL the acting in this film is fine. EXCEPT the deceased mother. Yeah, you'ld think playing the role of a dead person would be a breeze for most, but she simply tries too hard, and the acting, is well, quite overacted. The GOOD news, is her segments are short, and you won't be subjected to too much of the overacted acting. (When you see it, you will be magically whisked away to a high school musical, with very bad overacted scenes...) I'd think just KNOWING her mother died and her father was a widower would have been enough information for the viewer. If they edited all the ""mom"" and ""missing mom"" scenes out, this film would be fine, as you pretty much get she has no mom during the first scene. Those other additions were kind of creepy to me, to see a child so obscessed with a person she never really knew.
Those scenes truly weren't needed to feel her need to bond with a female figure, like her teachers. AND, a valuable lesson is learned, pretty packages aren't all they are wrapped up to be, the best person for her might not be the pretty package, but the one with the plain brown wrapper. I'll leave the movie watching to you to see that, another valuable lesson!
I LOVED the music, and wasn't bored once. I even had to snicker a time or two, perhaps she DID remind me of myself at that age. And even if you never were an awkward preteen, the self doubts she feels I'm sure were felt by everyone.
Now, kids that age in my junior high school weren't so kind and forgiving. There was a lot of maturity in the conversations of these preteens. In real life, when true jealousy occurs, there is bound to be some name calling and rarely forgiveness. But this movie lacks the name calling, and is full of forgiveness. THAT is why I found it a breath of fresh air. In real life, and outcast is an outcast, and they usually need therapy by the time they are 30. In this movie, an outcast is accepted, and befriended. So, maybe not true to real life, but true in the sense that it is the way things SHOULD be.
I'm going to share this video with family and friends with preteens. I feel it has a message and a story that needs to be shared!

 The experience of being a teenager and the difficulties of having to pick up and move to a new place or a new school without any friends is something that many teens have to deal with, so it is good how they handle this theme. Alice spends part of the time bumbling through real experiences, part of the time imagining a better outcome, and part of the time narrating her frustrations with an aside to the audience. What she comes to realize is that we all have ""growing pains"" that we have to deal with, and to look for others who will support her through these tough times.

The film also focuses on the father's (played by Luke Perry) issues, such as learning how to raise kids on his own. He wants to be a good father, but sometimes isn't sure what the right answer is, and has to struggle through this.

While this is a clean family movie, it is probably best suited for the younger kids. It isn't above average filmmaking here, but Alice Upside Down has some important morals that hit close to home, and they do a nice job presenting these.",1217894400,,1342,4.443089430894309
3411110,4,B00180OU7U,"Faced with the challenges of a sixth grade girl growing up with the complication of having lost her mother at an early age, the film revolves around the school-centric experience. Things are further complicated for Alice because her father, played by Luke Perry, purchases an out of town music store forcing a family move. Everything seems to be working against her, hence the title, ""Upside Down"". Even the teacher she was given Mrs. Plotkin played by Penny Marshall was considered to be the mean teacher, and something to be avoided.  The school play tryout was a disaster.
I can't reflect on the movie any deeper than that, otherwise I would be giving away the ending.  I think that the moral of the movie is that when you think that your world is falling apart, and you are the most unpopular person, it really is a faade, and given a chance, support and friendship can come from the most unexpected places.",1217721600,,911,4.6875
3411111,3,B00180OU7U,"Based on the first in a series of children's books by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, ALICE UPSIDE DOWN offers up the familiar-yet-pleasing-enough story of a sixth grader Alice McKinley, as she faces the challenges of trying to fit in in a new school.  I haven't read any of the books, but the movie follows the ""tween"" girl-power formula popularized by the likes of Hannah Montana and any number of Disney-style adolescent comedies.

Among the well-worn cliches (boys are either icky or hot, single dad Luke Perry fumbles through cooking a Thanksgiving dinner), the best thing about ALICE is Alice herself, played with believable awkwardness by Alyson Stoner.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical-Encore-Edition/dp/B000F2BNW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical (Encore Edition)</a>'s Lucas Grabeel is fine as Alice's older brother, and Penny Marshall is the reputed meanest teacher in the sixth grade.  The rest of the cast is really average, with Perry in particular looking rather bored.

Parents can rest assured, it's perfectly fine for your kids to take ALICE home.  It's quite inoffensive, but may be a bit too bland for older teens.",1217635200,,1203,5.851428571428571

I love this movie and recomend it. Brought back some memories from my jr high years. This is the first in a series of direct to video Alice movies based on the books of the same title.

Alyson Stoner does a very good job of acting in this film. Some may remember her from Mikes super short show and Suite life of Zack and Cody.
She also guest stared on an ep of Thats So Raven.

In the above series her characters were out going in Alice(She plays Alice) the character is subdued compaired to the above. She plays the subdued Alice great, which shows off her range of acting she can do.
Her best scene is at the end when she is crying while talking to her dad.
You can see real tears. One of the few actresses that pulls off a scene like that so convinceingly.

Lucas Grabeel from High School Musical plays Alices brother.

Alice is a girl where everything she does seems to go wrong.
To borrow a phrase ""If it weren't for bad luck she would have no luck at all.""

If that weren't enough her mom died a few years early and they have moved recently to a new house away from eveything she new. She falls on her face
fitting in the first day at her new school. The girl across the street does however give her a change at school after there first meeting as they were moving in seemingly taking an instant dislike to Alice.

In the end things start to work out. I like that its not a she lives happy every after ending. In the next films she will not dought face new problems to work out.

This is sort of Lizzie Mcquireish that we see what she is thinking live action not cartoon. The tone of the film is Nickelodeon. Would be a good network for it to air on.

Start collecting these films. Good store, Good lessons, Good acting.

Oh there is soundtrack avalable for this movie. Alyson sings two songs.
One a solo, and one a duet. Lost and Found and Free Spirit. You can get the soundtrack with the movie in a double pack but only at Walmart. They should do a normal release of the Soundtrack.  The soundtrack is not avalable seprately.",1217548800,3,2105,4.2375
