DISC 1 is labeled Total Toning Plus Cardio.  This is a reprint of Quickfix Hit The Spot Total Body Workout.  This has 4 - 10 minute segments: Upper body, cardio, lower body, abs.
DISC 2 is labeled Core Strength.  This is a reprint of the New Method 20/20 Series: Precision Abs.  This has 2 - 20 minute segments.  These are a combination of yoga and pilates.

DISC 4 is labeled Body Weight Toning.  I believe this a reprint of The Method: Dynamic Toning (same set, same instructor).  There are 4 segments:  Dynamic, Total Body, Upper Body and Abdominals. These pilates and yoga based.",1442534400,,932,4.520958083832335
8492839,1,B0064QTUZ0,"This DVD is horrible! I thought it would be a great deal for the price, so I bought it. Out of 4 DVD's there's only ONE 10 minute workout that's ""good"". All of the discs are very corny/cheesy. Looks like they were taped in the 80's. There's one dvd where they have an acoustic band playing in the background. The instructor is creepy, as she keeps looking in the camera when they're trying to get different angles. Please save your money. It's so not worth purchasing.",1328659200,3,468,4.453488372093023
