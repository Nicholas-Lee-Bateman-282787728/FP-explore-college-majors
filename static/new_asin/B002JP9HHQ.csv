8371539,4,B002JP9HHQ,"Since,  I knew nothing of Felsenstein or this operetta before watching it, it is quite possible that I would rate it higher or lower on second viewing. So, take this as a provisional first time response. Most significant is the adjustment to the fact that this was not a live performance being filmed but rather a  film created as such. Certainly, this makes quite a  bit of difference, given the sharp distinction between working directly with an audience, person to person, so to speak, and trying to guess how an audience will react when sitting before a screen with no possibility of emotional interaction with them moment by moment.
At any rate, to my reaction. Over-all, I welcomed the opportunity to watch an operetta by Offenbach, under any circumstances, particularly a less well known one as compared to those generally remembered and  performed. It took a bit of time to get into the spirit of play the director was seeking to create in what was, after all, a piece about a guy who murders his wives as soon as he tires of them....very rapidly as it happens. The singers did immediately grip me, being as all the roles were, quite well sung. Naturally, I could not see the performance with the outlook of a 19th Century audience, but, once I got a grip on the presentation, I enjoyed it. Much of the satire passed me by, not being a replica of a member of the original audience, but Felsenstein does modify the original to fit the viewpoint of a contemporary audience. Some of the humor was pretty crude but forgivably so.
Overall, the singing was quite good, the acting sometimes way 'over the top'- but acceptable within the context of the play,  the staging and scenery were suitable for the purpose
I think that someone interested in Offenbach should see it, as should those who are devoted to the period in general, or comic opera and operetta, in particular. Others should be wary of laying out a sum of money they would miss, since there is a likelihood that coming upon it 'cold', you would regret the expenditure.
I do have the feeling that a second viewing, aware of what I will be watching, will leave me feeling a good deal more positive than I now feel. This uncertainty is about all I can convey right now.",1449100800,,2231,4.609571788413098
8371540,4,B002JP9HHQ,"This is a delightful bit of fun that I've seen/listened to many times now.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because one of the sopranos, while perfect for the part in every other way, has a voice that is a little too shrill for me.  The music is one of Offebach's best efforts, to my mind.",1299628800,2,294,3.9661016949152543
8371541,3,B002JP9HHQ,"this is a german interpretation of offenbach.  where the french productions of offenbach are humorous, sparkly, meaningful, yet witty, this german production is
heavy handed.  the portrayls are so strange it feels like franz kafka smacking you
over the head, while trying to be funny, and satirical of european political situations.  having said that, the voices are very good, the king is so wierdly
outrageous, but human at the same time, i admired the performance, and the overall
production.  but if a production of 'bluebeard' from opera de lyon came out, i would get that in a heart-beat.",1274745600,2,594,5.030612244897959
8371542,2,B002JP9HHQ,"After reading glowing review of Barbe Bleue and director Felsenstein in Opera News, I was disappointed with the old fashioned production.  Compared to the same composer's Zurich production of La Belle Helene, this has no sparkle and appears heavy-handed.",1272758400,,254,5.512820512820513
8371543,4,B002JP9HHQ,"Considering when this movie was originally made, both the video and audio are very good. Costumes, settings, singing & acting are also very good. Musically, this is one of Offenbach's better operettas. My only complaint is the that the director sometimes sacrifices Offenbach's ideas for his own.",1272672000,2,296,5.319148936170213
8371544,3,B002JP9HHQ,"Its an enjoyable opera, but I had to watch it on my computer as my RCA television with built in DVD player couldn't read the disc.  The message kept coming back Wrong Disc Type and it would spit the disc back out.  Has anyone else encountered this problem?",1265587200,,256,4.3125
8371545,4,B002JP9HHQ,"Vienna-born Walter Felsenstein (1901-1975) founded the Comic Opera of Berlin in 1947 under Soviet sponsorship. He oversaw the studio filming of his very popular stage production of Offenbach's operetta Bluebeard in 1973. This work, comprising spoken and sung portions, was rendered into German, with some improving emendations.

The DVD offers a well-refurbished print that however is flawed by the color process which looks like two-strip, monotonizing blue with splashes of orange-red. Hardly the sumptious Technicolour of Pressburger-Powell's Tales of Hoffmann.

The operetta comprises four scenes: a country village, the throne room, the alchemist-poisoner's cellar, the ceremonial hall for marriage.

The acting is relentless caricature,  and every performer does his thing as told. (You may be a bit embarrassed to see grown-ups behaving so, until you get used to it.) Bluebeard's costume is absolutely baroque. The wigs are elaborate and stiff. The black eyelashes pasted on the women worsen the hard visages of some of these Sovietized frauleins.

""Romantic"" complications abound as shepherdess & shepherd turn out to be princess & prince, the king and his ""unfaithful"" queen spat, Bluebeard (having lost five wives to ""natural"" causes) seeks to rid himself of a potential sixth so he can have the princess as a seventh. And the obsequious courtiers can think only of their own advancement. At final crisis, someone steps up and says, Oh hell, this is just an operetta, let's end happy-snappy. Bad idea: the credits roll over the final musical number.

The music is jaunty and clever, the singing professional, entertainment is sustained, but naught is beautiful, dramatic, or memorable. Pressburger-Powell would have done better, but with more emendations and more artistic design and filming techniques, plus ballet!

In the supplements, constituting disc 2, Felsenstein gives two short audio-only interviews (1963, '64) on filming and production, while stills occupy the screen. The third supp shows programs from international stage productions, where only the large type is legible. There is also a booklet.

In sum, this IS Offenbach, nicely rendered into the German tongue, with a strong directorial hand, and worth your money and time.",1260835200,3,2251,5.504347826086956
8371546,4,B002JP9HHQ,"This is not Offenbach's greatest operetta but it is indeed quite enjoyable. The singers are all quite good and are remarkable actors. The sets and costumes are very good, and the sound is better than acceptable.  All in all everything is done with verve and thus this is one of the best DVDs of an Offenbach operetta.  While it is done mostly in German, it still bubbles.",1258588800,2,371,4.522388059701493
8371547,4,B002JP9HHQ,"This operetta, Barbe Bleu(Bluebeard), is sung in German but the viewer of this DVD has the option to view the subtitles in English, French and Italian. There is a second DVD that accompanies the original DVD in the package and it contains stage directions and film clips from performances of this work in the 1960's. The DVD captures the spirit of the original performances which won world wide acclaim everywhere except in France. It would have captured France if the performance was sung in French, the original language of this Opera. The director, Walter Felsenstein, does a magnificent job in directing this production in sets that could have originated in 19th century productions of this work. It would have been nice if the libretto to this operetta was enclosed with the DVD.
I recommend this DVD for purchase to those who like Offenbach, French comedy, and a production which will probably not be rivalled anytime soon. Purchase now before it goes out of print!",1257120000,8,971,4.926829268292683
8371548,1,B002JP9HHQ,"This is another unfortunate case where the stage director considers himself to know more about what the composer
should have done than the composer himself.  This dvd is about Felsenstein, not Offenbach - a great disappointment
since there seems to be no other recording of Offenbach's Ritter Blaubart - even on pirate recordings",1254700800,4,329,5.2075471698113205
