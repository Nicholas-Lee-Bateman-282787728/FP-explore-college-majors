3111631,3,B0013J6EOS,Good movie throughout. Usual stuff; robbery turned to cop killing and ensuing manhunt.,1412812800,,86,5.6923076923076925
3111632,4,B0013J6EOS,"I very much enjoyed this film. It was well written, splendidly paced, and thanks to an abundance of location filming, it offers 21st century viewers an excellent glimpse of London in the lean years following World War II. The cast includes some of Britain's most accomplished character actors and a very young Dirk Bogarde. Though this film shares some qualities with the many film noirs being produced at the time, it is essentially an upbeat tribute to the decency and competence of London's Metropolitan Police. The picture it presents of the police is somewhat romanticized, but I didn't mind that in the least. All in all, I think ""The Blue Lamp"" is a very satisfying entertainment.",1408233600,10,687,4.931034482758621
3111633,5,B0013J6EOS,Excellant movie with film noir type feel in murder mystery style...had to view on my computer cause it was made for a different region. Thoroughly enjoyed the historic feature of the bobbies of old England.,1314662400,7,206,4.914285714285715

3111655,4,B0013J6EOS,Enjoyable. Great shots of post blitz London. Lots of familiar British actors. The heavy is a young Dirk Bogarde.,1445558400,,112,4.947368421052632

3111657,4,B0013J6EOS,"Much better movie than you'd at first expect. Sometimes it's hard to watch an old movie because of being used to the way movies are filmed today. Even a good story can get lost in the ""antiquity"" of the time period. Although this film gives the impression at first of not being able to hold your attention, you will find that as it unfolds you'll be staying with it till the end. It may not be fair to compare an old film to the contemporary ones, but I know I do that automatically. I'm glad I stuck with this one, especially through the slowness that pervades after the opening scenes. It's a good story and, eventually, a few good action scenes. As old movies go, I'm adding this one to my list of favorite hits from the past.",1433808000,,729,4.2898550724637685

3111662,1,B0013J6EOS,Interesting to see a young Dirk Bogarde. He played the young tough in the movie. I didn't particularly care for the silly story.,1424390400,,128,4.608695652173913
3111663,5,B0013J6EOS,"We're introduced to veteran police officers, PC George Dixon (Jack Warner), and rookie, PC Andy Mitchell (Jimmy Hanley), two like-able blokes on the beat. Meanwhile, a crime-wave is under way, involving young, ruthless thugs. Said ruffians are up to no good, planning their next nefarious scheme. After a jewelry heist, the punks show that they don't mind using violence, when they knock out a copper during their escape! Not surprisingly, Dixon and Mitchell are on a collision course w/ these young toughs. Sadly, the delinquent crooks have acquired firearms, resulting in a tragic encounter w/ Dixon. Can these miscreants be caught before worse incidents occur? Scotland Yard is on the case. THE BLUE LAMP is another gem from Ealing Studios.  A fine Brittish crime drama from 1950 w/ a great cast, especially Dirk Bogarde as the crazed, desperate killer, Tom Riley. The finale at the dog track is a classic!...",1418428800,4,912,5.08
