8044967,1,B00076PXKY,"The message is pretty clear: don't trust pencil-necked geek scientists (check out the protester's costume for verification) or artists (in the video game version of this atrocity the villian abducts children into a reconstructed world ""where nothing is real"" called A.R.T.) and don't question what you're told (the protester's weapon is the 'iconoclastic-skepticizer').

The message is clear: if you happen to come across a teacher or parent who is skeptical, politically protests, enjoys art, or questions authority, this person is the enemy of God, a living incarnation of evil, little more than a demon to be destroyed.",1216857600,,622,5.412371134020619
8044968,5,B00076PXKY,"I didn't mind superman and batman at earlier ages, but they seem to have become darker. I was looking for something else, and this fit the bill.  And, my son is just as interested in Bibleman as he was/is in the other so-called superheroes. Reccommend this highly!!",1179705600,2,265,4.638297872340425
8044969,5,B00076PXKY,"My son loves PowerRangers but gets too out-of-control when he watches them.  We have discovered Bibleman, whom he seems to love equally as well.  I love that he gets the action/adventure that he enjoys with the faithbased message.  As for the reviewer complainging about the right-wingers, I pity him.  I am a right wing Christian and find that I am much more openminded than my liberal counterparts.  Perhaps he should actually watch the Bibleman movies BEFORE he passes judgement.",1142467200,5,482,5.050632911392405
8044970,5,B00076PXKY,"Amazing to me that someone rates something they have never seen.  Well I have seen these, they are cute the kids love them! They come in our store chanting Bibleman, Bibleman!  Want to have decent alternative to the garbage on tv?  This teaches excellent morals, and how to actually live with people- something really missing from todays kids product.",1127174400,12,351,4.915254237288136
8044971,1,B00076PXKY,"This is the 1st time that I've written a review for something I haven't seen. I accidentally stumbled across the 'Bibleman' site, and at 1st, found it hilarious. When I saw that Bibleman's opponent was the WACKY PROTESTOR, that is when I became somewhat incensed. It is only obvious (in my humble opinion), that this is a dressed up indoctrination DVD that helps Christian fanatics deal w/tough questions, like ""Mommy, why is that man protesting?"" ""Daddy, what is free speech?"" I would like to note that I am not an activist or a protestor, but both of these activities are noble ones, and while there are ridiculous examples (people protesting the remake of 'Ocean's Eleven', for one), there are by far a majority of protestors WHO DO make a difference, and political dissent is an ingredient that created this great nation. If the technology had been available in McCarthy's era, the villain would've been 'Socialist Sammy', who seeks to undermine the Capitalist way of life by luring innocent children into the Cave of Communism! Note that I am not attempting to tell people how to raise their children, or what they should believe, but to be aware of the senseless (and often invidious) labeling of others as enemies, if they have objections to the way one thinks, or believes. I am sorry, but it smacks of indoctrination. I will write a letter to the Bibleman creators protesting this egregious use of labeling, but I can only hope that this review will at least make one person stop and think first.",1121472000,8,1505,4.792307692307692
