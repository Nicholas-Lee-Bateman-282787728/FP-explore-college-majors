I really loved Linnea's character role, which seemed to be very close/true to life to her big, kind heart of gold in real life. I have honestly been one of her biggest truest fans since 1986, at about the age of 10 or eleven. Her quite compromising role of young, drop-dead gorgeous Denise in 'Silent Night, Deadly Night' was the first time that I ever had the complete pleasure of laying my eyes on her....& they've been pretty googly ever since!!!!
I've never gotten the sheer honor of meeting The Queen in person. But, I think I lucked out and did one all the better>>>>>>>after sending her a long awaited/overdue fan letter to her ""asklinnea"" web address, I then sent her a little follow-up Face Book message,& not only did she send me back a sweet, personable reply......but 4 or five months later, I received a friendly lil' 2nd message totally out of the blue, telling me that she hoped I had had a great Halloween, and that all was well with me!!!!!
Needless to say: they're printed-framed-and hanging up on my living room wall.  -Jason Sparks.",1343606400,2,1191,4.644549763033176
7884791,4,6305183325,"A very good horror movie, especially if you are a Linnea Quigley fan. Nice to see James Best in this one. For a B movie this one kept me interested all the way through. Definitely adding this one to the collection.",1255132800,2,214,4.2439024390243905
7884792,2,6305183325,"There seems to be some confusion among the Amazon reviews about this product.  ""Death Mask"" is a low-budget horror film starring James Best (of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" TV show) as Wilbur, a socially awkward carnival geek who nurtures a frustrated love of women.  Although he finds himself falling for Linnea Quigley, romantic feelings that are at least partly requited, Wilbur simultaneously becomes attached to a beautiful death mask that forces him (liberates him?) into becoming a killer.  I can't say that I have an objective opinion about this film -- I'm not a fan of the genre and only picked it up because I went to high school with a cast member -- but it struck me that James Best had some real talent and I don't know whether to be impressed or saddened that he put so much of it into this sort of movie.",1200355200,3,814,4.523809523809524
7884793,5,6305183325,"This was probably one of my favorite movies I have seen this year.  There was great acting, wonderful dialogue, and the movie as gorgously shot by Max ""Bee Man"" Beck.  The director Steve Latshaw is one of the best directors to emerge from the Orlando, Florida area and manages to top his last film, the classic Jack-O.  The script, written by the talanted James Best, tells the tale of a misunderstood carnival mask carver, Wilbur.  He teams up with the fabulous Linnea Quigley, who plays a cheap, dime slut bimbo, and they wander off to the swamp to find a witch to help Wilbur create a mask of beauty.  The mask turns out to be made with evil, thus the bloodbath ensues...  Lots of breasts and blood...",1111708800,2,704,4.503937007874016

7884795,1,6305183325,"Please note that this is the wrong video!  The review description relates to a martial arts movie starring Ti Lung; however, when I received the video, it's a horror/B-grade movie and I had to return it to Amazon.  I am still waiting my refund by the way!  The title is wrong; it should have been called ""Death Mask of the Ninja,"" not ""Death Mask"" alone.",1004918400,3,354,4.415384615384616
7884796,5,6305183325,"This is one of my favorite kung fu movies and it ranks up there with Swordsman 2 in my eyes.  The dubbing is really cheesy and adds a lot to the fun.  This movie is about two brothers separated at birth to protect them from the evil Ninth Prince who killed their father to steal the throne.  One brother grows up under the thumb of the Ninth Prince and secretly learns kung fu, but his skills are not enough to defeath the Ninth Prince.  The other brother, who is presumed dead, was dropped off at a small courtyard inhabited by the three Holy Fools.  They are being punished for hurting too many people with their kung fu and are not allowed to leave the compound.  They agree to raise Tou Heng.  They end up teaching him their powerful form of martial arts without him even knowing it.  This movie has some of the most best fight choreography I have seen in any movie!  This is a MUST SEE for any kung fu fan.  In fact, buy two in case one wears out.",999216000,2,952,4.181318681318682
