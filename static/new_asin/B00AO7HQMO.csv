8555199,5,B00AO7HQMO,"This 59 minute concert (listed as 55 minutes on the package) was recorded in 1983 during the 25th anniversary of London's famous Marquee Club. It features the NOLa legend Dr. John (Mac Rebennack) playing on stage with British band leader and trombonist Chris Barber and his ""Jazz and Blues Band"". Dr. John starts it off with a solo and then the band gets a shot and then they combine efforts - with solos throughout). There are 10 numbers, with some running almost 1o minutes. Mac Shows his Professor Longhair piano chops on ""Mac's Boogie Woogie"" and his blues vocals on ""Stranded"". Barber and the band shine on ""New Orleans Memories (Medley) and ""Little Liza Jane"". Of, course, it all culminates with ""When the Saints Go Marching In"". Of particular mention is the camera work which has some amazingly sharp images of Dr. John's fingers on the piano keys and Barber on Trombone.
As I said, this was 1983 and Dr.  John was in his prime them, not relying on the ""same old"" that he kept doing in the 1990s. He was wearing no ""hair jewelry"" that he did in later years and you can tell that the older - and more experienced Barber was really into Dr. J's playing that night.

The DVD is plackaged in a cardboard package with some brief background liner notes on Dr. John. Issued by a British company they obviously felt folks knew all about Barber and his band.
Highly recommended for Dr. John fans or anyone into New Orleans jazz and blues.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
