8279805,1,B001AUKUWM,"If you want to stink up the room fast, then pop in this truly dreadful ""movie."" You'll sit there with your jaw wide open thinking ""What kind of compromising photos do they have on Eugene Levy"" to get him to co-star in this stinker?"" Linda Hamilton, I understand because her career was over long ago. She needs the gig.

No doubt this story is inspired by real people and real events, but that doesn't always translate into a good movie. Save your money. Save your time. Go watch ""Casablanca"" again, or even ""Diary of a Teenage Girl,"" both far, far superior to this tripe.",1455408000,,571,4.490384615384615

8279807,5,B001AUKUWM,"Fun film, Majandra Delfino being a brilliant actress. Funny, light and well acted",1045785600,2,81,5.3076923076923075
8279808,4,B001AUKUWM,"I was at Blockbuster at this movie just called out to me.  I watched it and just fell in love with Majandra.  This was the first time I had seen her act and this movie was really what got me into liking her.
Anyone who watched Roswell: this role showcases her true talent SO much more than Maria Deluca ever did.
Only complaint is that she doesn't sing at all (I absolutely love her music), but it really doesn't fit into the role, so it's understandable.
Check it out cuz Maj is a great actress, a great singer, and an amazingly nice person (met her at her first show in NYC, she's so gorgeous in person).
It's a cute indie film that will surprise you.",1024876800,,653,4.216
8279809,4,B001AUKUWM,"mmm mmm mmm GOOD, as in MEAGAN GOOD, she is so beautiful, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Her acting skills have improved since the first movie I seen her in ""Eve's Bayou"" were she played Daddy's (Danny Glover) little girl. She has rapidly grown from that pretty little girl into a very attractive young lady. I can't wait to see her mature into a gorgeous woman. Her performance as the ""bad girl"" was really not her calling , but she pulled it off with flying colors. EUGENE LEVY is one of my favorite comedy actors, love his expressions, classic ""SCTV"". Loved LINDA HAMILTON as the Mom very talented not to mention luvly actress. The whole 70's theme, wardrobe & decor was awesome. One thing I didn't like about the movie was the last scene, two hot young ladies undressing down to their bathing suits and diving into the water and the scene only last one minute, NOW THAT SHOULD BE A CRIME.....

8279810,1,B001AUKUWM,"This movie was awful and utterly pointless.  Well, maybe there was a point, to show how naive this girl was.  Totally stupid movie!!!",981504000,,133,4.739130434782608
