4237935,5,B004047XZM,Bought as a gift for son-in-law. He absolutely loves it. The Rifftrax guys are silly and not as offensive as others.,1395792000,,116,4.571428571428571
4237936,5,B004047XZM,"If you are getting a little tired of the same old Christmas shows and specials, give yourself a treat and spend time with Mike and the guys as they take funny material and elevate it to a comedy classic! MY 15 year old niece watched this with me and told me to please purchase a Rifftrax shorts for her!! It runs in the family!",1395273600,,327,4.125
4237937,5,B004047XZM,"Full disclosure: I'm kind of a sucker for Christmas specials, and this Rifftrax live event from 2009 is no exception. Mike, Kevin, and Bill do a great job riffing a variety of Christmas-themed shorts, which run the gamut from surreal to just plain awful; seriously, I think that watching them un-riffed might do permanent retinal and/or emotional damage. Also, Weird Al guest riffs on one, and the guys all give each other some truly unique Christmas gifts. This is definitely going to be a part of my family's holiday traditions from now on (along with ""Santa Claus and the Ice Cream Bunny"" :)).",1357862400,,596,4.796116504854369
4237938,5,B004047XZM,"The guys of Rifftrax are back, live and in living color with their sharp wits and clever lines ready to aim at some of the worst shorts based around the wonderful holiday of Christmas. Before and after each short the guys keep the live audience entertained with their banter.

""Christmas Toyshop""-Two kids are visited by a creepy sandman who helps them dream of christmas, and chatting with Santa who couldn't look more uninterested if he tried. Meanwhile their dad plays Santa and tries to set up the tree and the gifts, too bad he's a stumbling idiot. Oh and there's also a story that Santa tells the children in the form of a bunch of toys fighting a giant spider. The jokes are quite good here as the material is just the right kind of goofy for them.

""A Visit to Santa""-Ultra cheap one here where two children want to meet Santa so they write a letter to him, he reads it in his lazyboy in a basement (I kid you not). The kids are brought to Santa's shop by an elf and they see all the toys that are made. It is such a creepy, cheap and awful film that the guys use some of their best jokes in this one. So hilarious throughout.

""Christmas Rhapsody""-We see the littliest tree in a forest cut down and used as a christmas tree for a family. Thats about it folks, however the guys do get some good jokes off at this one.

""Three Magic Words""-Weird Al Yankovic joins the guys for this odd film about three guys who sing about the wonders of cooking, preparing and serving different dishes using pork. Its really odd and kinda creepy how the three guys keep popping up at odd times, but most of the jokes are funny even Weird Al fits in fine.

Mike and Bill present a gift to Kevin in the form of an old commercial about a battery operated dog named Gaylord. A few good jokes here, but its over before you know it.

""Twas The Night Before Christmas""-The classic rhyme is told as a family gets ready for bed to wake up Christmas morning, the dad sees Santa and his reindeer taking off to start delivering presents. Its well meaning but still pretty bad, thankfully the guys do a great job with this one.

Kevin and Mike present a gift to Bill, a commercial for some flight simulator called Jimmy Jet, which is very short, but the skit they do afterwards was funny.

""A Christmas Dream""-A girl gets some new gifts for christmas and casts her old doll to the side, but that night Santa comes in and makes the young girl dream the old doll coming to life. What follows is a series of creepy stuff the doll does to impress the girl enough so she won't get rid of it again. The guys do some great work here as they just seem stunned by the sheer madness of this short.

""Parade of Aquatic Champions""-Some footage of random people competiting in various swimming games, while a narrator talks about who they are. Its not a christmas short but it is quite funny as they always do well with these dull shorts.

Bill and Kevin present their gift to Mike which is the famous and very disturbing commercial for the toy named Ding-a-Ling. Oh the reactions alone are worth watching this.

""Rudolph: The Red Nosed Reindeer""-A 1940's cartoon retelling of the classic christmas tale of the world's most famous reindeer. The problem with this one is the images and suggestive material was horrifying on its own. Thankfully the guys rip on just about everything here and the funniest line of the night comes when Kevin reacts to something Santa says to Rudolph which causes the theater to explode in laughter for about 30 seconds straight.

This is a fun dvd which shows the guys at some of their high points as they have fun with some of the worst Christmas films ever.",1330300800,3,3654,4.4211309523809526
4237939,4,B004047XZM,"This 90-ish minute collection of Christmas-related shorts (plus a couple of non-Christmas efforts for good measure) is easily the best release from the Rifftrax crew yet.  These guys really seem to hit their stride with short films.  The highlights are ""A Visit to Santa's Workshop"", featuring two kids who speak incoherently and a Santa that sounds like a wise guy (the Rifftrax crew suggest that it was made by David Lynch), and a Rudolph cartoon that turns inexplicably suggestive to the point that the audience is just screaming laughter and the riffers miss some lines. These shorts would have you on the floor laughing even without the riffing.

There's also three old commercials for toys that will leave you going ""Wow.  Just...wow.""

Plus, Weird Al Yankovic guest riffs one of the shorts.

My two negatives for this release...There are times where it's hard to understand what the riffers are saying...Kevin in particular...because of the echoing sound of the live performance.  And it would have been nice if they included the shorts as standalone extra features.

Still...this will be the funniest Christmas show you own.  A must for your Christmas collection.",1328054400,2,1171,5.121052631578947
4237940,4,B004047XZM,"Other than that, I've watched this four times since purchasing this a little over a month ago and still laugh.  Saw this in the theater and as goofy as everything is, it put me in the Christmas mood. The riffing being done in front of a live audience makes a big difference.  There was a little bit at the end of the theatrical show that doesn't make it into this DVD -- a 1 or 2 minute taped sequence where the guys spew pixelized vomit in their office -- but outside of that and the funny pre-show movie trivia, you are getting the full show.  As noted elsewhere, all the shorts are about Christmas except two -- one about pork and another about swimming in Hollywood.  I enjoyed the pork short but the swimming one didn't have the density of gags as the other shorts.  That aside, this is a DVD I could watch again and again since many shorts or portions of each are hilariously riffed.  The Christmas Dream is worth the price of admission along with the David Lynch Christmas short and the mutilation of the tree of no account in Christmas Rhapsody.
It also pays to be a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 to understand the audience reaction to Prince of Space.

Sincerely,

Big McLarge Huge",1292630400,8,1196,4.404545454545454
4237941,5,B004047XZM,"This is a different kind of DVD.  The MST guys are live.  Weird Al makes a visit.  If you are a MST fan, you will enjoy this DVD.",1290902400,2,129,3.5357142857142856
4237942,5,B004047XZM,"I attended the live production in Escondido with friends and it was a delight.  Mike, Kevin, & Bill briefly chatted us up while we waited in line, which was really cool.

The show, unlike other Fathom live broadcasts (""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", House on Haunted Hill"" & ""Reefer Madness""), consisted solely of shorts.  As this was a Christmas themed show, they managed to scrounge up some odd little yule tide  gems.  Whether it was the night-terrors inducing ""Christmas Dream"" or the creepy and uncomfortable ""Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer"".  No, I'm not talking about the beloved Christmas staple, the Rankin-Bass claymation classic, but the Max Fleischer cartoon, made in 1948.  Trust me, it's bizarre and the guys lampoon it's creepiness.

another short gives us the insecure musings of a small tree called, ""Christmas Rhapsody"".  ""A visit to Santa's Workshop"", has that cheap, hokey 1960's patina that makes you laugh just watching it.  Mike, Kevin & Bill's quips only make you laugh harder.  The similiarly titled, ""Santa's Toyshop"", offers us unfunny pratfalls, a demonic-looking Mr. Sandman, a top hat wearing spider, and a platoon of toy soldiers looking to kick some chapeu wearing archnid ass!

The last two shorts aren't really holiday related.  There's the 1950's offering of Hollywood actors cavorting in and around a pool for charity.  Though there are a few amusing riffs in this short (The name escapes me), it was my least favorite.  The other was a bit of a treat, having the talented weird Al Yankovic join in the riffing of ""Three Magic Words"", a short extolling the virtues of Pork.  This film features the neverending harmonizing of a singing trio, The Jesters, as they instruct the world's dumbest blonde on how to make a great pork dinner.  The guys really seemed to enjoy riffing this swine story, and cracked several good lines.

Interspliced in between the shorts were a look at some funny tv ads for toys made in the 50's and 60's.  Since I'm roughly the same age as the Rifftrax gang, I enjoyed the trip down memory lane.

If you are a fan of the MST3K and, in particular, a fan of their riffing of shorts then you'll love this DVD.  Make it part of your Christmas tradition; sitting in your favorite chair stuffing generous amounts of bacon down your maw, while watching Santa express his deepest, sorted, filthy desires to a reindeer.",1289692800,16,2367,4.85286783042394
4237943,4,B004047XZM,"Hi
  I saw this show originally in Dec 2009 LIVE at our local Cinemark movie theatre. There were several shorts presented here hazed by the guys (I believe the robots have been retired). By memory, one short about a doll chucked and forgotten by a girl who is  terrorized by the doll and Santa. Another short was apromotional film about PORK starring a poor man's three stooges and a woman w/ an annoying voice (the guys ambasted her voice). Yet another short involved a cheap version of ""Rudolph, the red nosed Reindeer"". Now as comparing the shorts from the MST3K show (some were outragously funny like Mr. B Natural and 21st century Calling) hese are okay. But as a whole,MST3K fans should be satisfied. A casual viewer I'd give 3 stars.",1282608000,6,740,4.633587786259542
8411914,5,B004047XZM,"This is my favorite Rifftrax Live and I come back to it not only every holiday season, but watch it several times throughout the year as well. With tons of fun shorts and a guest riff by Weird Al, it has just about everything you've come to expect from Mike, Bill, and Kevin since they sidestep into the gig after MST3k went away.

It's so hard to choose my favorite joke because almost everyone one still gets me... but the cat barking and the three riffs lost due to laughing over Santa needing Rudolf tonight rank pretty high! If you only get one Christmas Rifftrax, make it this one... but don't just get one, please. While this is the best, they have half a dozen other Christmas films riffed for your pleasure as well. I suggest you check them out!",1483488000,,754,4.385714285714286
8411915,5,B004047XZM,Got this for my wife as a Christmas gift. We like MST3K and we would always see Cinematic Titanic live when Joel and his crew would come to our neck of the woods. But Mike Nelson has always been our favorite! There are some great shorts on this DVD. The Rudolf cartoon at the end is easily the most disturbing! You'll see what I mean. Sometimes these dvds are hit or miss. This is a hit! Get it!,1482883200,,395,4.076923076923077
8411916,4,B004047XZM,"This was a great one, but not as good as some of the other ones. I don't know what it was, perhaps the selection of shorts, but they have done better. And I was saddened that as much as I love Weird Al, he didn't fit in well with the style of humor on this outing.",1452470400,,264,3.732142857142857

8411919,5,B004047XZM,"It's beginning to look a lot like one messed-up Christmas, but the Rifftrax crew wouldn't have it any other way. This live show features eight well-chosen shorts, of which ""A Visit to Santa"" reminds us that yes, Santa is an anagram of SATAN; ""The Night Before Christmas"" sets the old Clement C. Moore poem to a film that could've been retitled ""Santa's Reefer Madness""; ""A Christmas Dream"" has a young girl entertained by a demonic rag doll; and Max Fleischer's ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" is simply one of the most suggestive children's cartoons ever made. Those are the standouts for me; the other four have some very funny moments, but nothing as twisted and hallucinatory as the ones I've mentioned, not even the singing, transdimensional pork butchers of ""Three Magic Words.""

Three increasingly bizarre TV toy commercials round out a memorable holiday film fest.",1424390400,,873,5.0625
8411920,5,B004047XZM,One of the funniest Rifftrax movies available and perfect for a holiday gift. Laugh-out-loud funny.,1423180800,,99,5.666666666666667

8411923,4,B004047XZM,"Some simple Christmas shorts rifted by the guys who know how to do it well! The best is the final offering -- an older version of Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer -- but there are so many gems here, including a few toy ads and - oddly (and more than a little out of place) - a short about professional swimmers at a function of some kind. There is also a rather morbid tale of a lonely tree that finds love after being cut down and dragged to a house to be decorated -- and you can imagine what the guys do with that one!
