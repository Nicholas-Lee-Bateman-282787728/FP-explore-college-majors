340987,4,630165160X,"A good portrayal by Colin Firth and Kenneth Branagh of what soldiers encountered after returning from war.  I loved watching Tom Birkin's (Colin Firth) stutter slowly fading as his work progresses on uncovering an ancient painting on the wall of a church.  A church in which he has to live in and where the rector's wife shows him more than a required amount of attention. When he isn't thinking of her, his nightmares of war haunt him.  I was thrilled with everyone's performances.  I believe the director of this film also directed ""Circle of Friends"".  Colin Firth appeared in a minor role in that film, also.  And, another connection in ""AMITC"" is the circuit preacher appeared in ""Shakespeare In Love"" with Colin Firth.  And, the rector's wife in ""AMITC"", Natasha Richardson, played with Colin in the HBO film, ""Hostages"".  I recommend these films, also.",995500800,69,859,4.916666666666667

341071,5,630165160X,"If you're expecting a Hollywood-style movie, you're bound to be disappointed. This is a very sweet film based on a novella about a young man who is emotionally scared from his experiences in WWI, and the summer he spends in a small Yorkshire town, Oxgodby. A film about pain, friendship, religion, love and art and the resilience to go on in spite of almost over-whelming odds it meanders slowly along, like many a good European movie; little plot, lots of character development. The friendship between Birkin (Firth) and Moon (Branagh) is simply beautiful and subtly handled, as is the burgeoning love between Birkin and the Vicar's wife (Richardson) which, of course, can and must come to nothing. Painting with fine brushes, the actors weave a fine tapestry in which the pauses are at least as important as the dialogue, which is quite sparse. Yorkshire fills in the gaps.. All the roles are, as so often in British movies, wonderfully cast and one feels the smells of Yorkshire summer, the breeze through ones hair and the damp of the church during the slow return to life of young men destroyed by the war to end all wars. I am of course, a hopeless romantic, but if you have a heart and don't expect blockbuster action, this gem a of a movie will surely move you. The score with undertones of Vaughan-Williams subtly underlines the frailty of it all; of a summer which will end never to return, and of life so fleeting. The only tragedy is that this copy was made from a copy found in some vault or other; the original seems lost, and so no newer better remaster is on the cards.

Of course, books & movies are two entirely different kettles of fish, but I was quite disappointed with what the filmmaker chose to put in & leave out & change.  Having said that, I found Colin Firth & Kenneth Branaugh entirely convincing in their roles as WWI vets who still suffer from their respective war traumas.

341127,4,630165160X,"The most important point I would make about A Month in The Country is to offer my thanks: a) that it finally became avaiable on DVD; and b) that Amazon chose to carry it at all, as it is hardly mainstream material.

I saw this film in a repertory cinema when it was first released all those years ago. I always wanted to have a copy of it, but as old fashioned as it might seem, I didn't want to download it from 'wherever'. I don't know that has ever been available that way, and I hope not. For many years I Google searched for a DVD version, and then simply gave up. I don't know what made me decide to search again, but I did just recently. Thank you Amazon.

As to the movie itself, I did a quick read thru other reviews already posted here. I don't feel I can add much insight beyond that provided. As noted, it's value lies as much in capturing the early work of the three principles, as it does in the story itself. Of course no one knew at that time the career path that would follow for Firth, Branagh and Richardson. I grieve the loss of the kind of talent that Natasha Richardson possessed. We are left to be grateful for the contribution she made to films such as this. Her final scene with Firth is a compelling study of a woman, trapped in an emotionally barren and suffocating marriage, who knows that she is on the brink of falling deeply in love with another man, but cannot see her way clear to realize that vision. Her predicament is underscored by the fine performance that Patrick Malahide provides as the lifeless and wholly unlikable Reverend Keach.

Achingly beautiful indeed. I don't find they make films like this much any more. They are not 'box office hits', and their value is scarcely acknowledged as a result. How sad it is.",1350432000,4,1756,4.347560975609756

341183,5,630165160X,"First off, the quality of the DVD transfer is quite good.  Definitely worth purchasing.

Update for the Blu-ray version.  The blu-ray quality is quite good.  The whole of the film is brightened up and the colors, especially of the countryside, pop in 1080p, far more than the DVD transfer.  Still no subtitles, but the sound quality of the BRD is better than the DVD.

As to the film.  This is simply a lovely, gentle, quiet period piece. Two young war-shattered men spend summer in the country where their time facing the horrors of the trenches in WWI slowly begin to heal and fade as they spend time in this quiet Yorkshire setting.

I will not dwell on the plot details as that is one of the pleasures of this small film as the story, especially that of Mr. Birkin (Firth), unfolds.

I will say that twenty-something's Colin Firth and Kenneth Branagh, looking so very young!, are both terrific in their parts.  It is more Firth's film and the potential of this future multiple acting award winner shines through as he carries the heart and soul of the story.

I can go no further than to recommend this wonderful film if one wishes to see these two actors in two of their earliest roles.  Both have become giants in their profession and this film certainly shows you why.",1312243200,3,1275,4.568281938325991
341184,5,630165160X,"This is a touching story of a young man re-entering civilian life after serving in The Great War.
Sensitive and moving, the plot shows him given no comfort nor advantage; but has him looked upon as adding to the
unemployment and poor economy as he finds work, at a rural church, in the restoration of an ancient mural.
  His interaction with, and treatment by, some of the local folk is often heart-rending, and leaves one

This is a transcription of the film into DVD region 1 format. If you live in the US, it will play on your DVD player.
For those of us in the US, waiting to see this gem for years, it's a godsend.

However:
There are literally no extras - the only menu choice is 'play the film'.
The aspect ratio doesn't quite fill a standard 16 x 9 screen, so there is a slightly ragged edge on both sides.
The sound is mono, since the film was originally made for television.

First, though, the problem with this film is that it isn't completely true to the novel and drops important plot points.  Therefore, it becomes rather obtuse.  However, it's brilliant for what it is.  Read the book and see the film and all your problems are solved!  (And the book is so short, it won't take but a moment to read and is well worth lingering over.)  The scene that I found the most moving -- one that hasn't been mentioned yet -- is the close conversation between Firth and Branagh in the pub in the village.  Branagh is wilting into his beer in a private moment when Firth sees him and joins him at table.  Branagh is literally incurably sad and, in a moment of raw honesty, tells Firth why.  When he bemoans the futility of war medals, my heart breaks a little bit.  His eyes fill with tears and so do mine.

I enjoyed watching the film as it captures the moods and tones of the book so brilliantly - especially thanks to the excellent acting performances. However, the film's leaving out details such as the summer outing and the sudden going away of the Keaches somehow seemed to distract from the superbly well balanced story conveyed by the book.

341223,4,630165160X,"Taken as a whole, this is a rather splendid, at times haunting, film which is based upon J.L. Carr's (1916-1994) beautiful and delicately crafted novella entitled 'A Month in the Country', 1980.

The main plot is set during the warm Summer of 1919 and tells of how two young men struggle to regain their 'peace of mind' in the tranquil Yorkshire countryside, after having experienced the horrors of 'The Great War' (World War 1).

A lady benefactor has bequeathed a considerable sum of money to a church in Yorkshire; in order for the church to realize the benefit of this gift, a medieval mural must be uncovered from beneath the Victorian paintwork superimposed over it. Simultaneously, the remains of one of the benefactor's predecessors are to be exhumed with rather startling consequences.

It is in these gentle, pastoral environs in and around the village church that the two main protagonists find their paths crossing; both are patently afflicted with nervous and mental disorders, wrought through them having experienced the downright terror and trauma of the Great War. This film is not simply some naive nostalgic nugget; the dark, tragic effects of war torn lives and communities are very evident.

The film reflects the overall ambiance of the novella reasonably well although it does not adhere to the dialogue or plot without aberration; one 'woodland' scene in particular - involving Tom Birkin (the mural restorer), played by Colin Firth and the local parson's wife, Alice Keach, played by Natasha Richardson - is a complete interpolation void of any substantial textual basis within Carr's original story. Nevertheless, the 'spirit' of the story is successfully retained and this is enhanced by a number of convincing performances, not least of all by Kenneth Brannagh who wallows in the rather engaging and multi-dimensional character of James Moon, an archaeologist working around the churchyard, seeking the grave of the aforementioned ancestor.

Apart from the excellent cinematography and Howard Blake's superbly apposite, mellifluous soundtrack, the story allows us something of a glimpse into the life of its author, J.L. Carr. Termed by some, not entirely appropriately, as 'the last Englishman', Carr himself was involved in a bitter and protracted struggle to redeem the fortunes of a deserted midland church earmarked for closure by various authorities. A blow by blow account of this struggle can indeed be found in 'The Last Englishman: The Life of J.L. Carr ' by Byron Rogers.

Howard Blake's wonderful and evocative score can be found on the CD 'Violin Concerto ""The Leeds""', superbly performed by the English Northern Philharmonia and conducted by Paul Daniel. Like the novella, the film version is as profound and affecting as the reader or viewer allows it to be.

341224,5,630165160X,"WW1 was called the ""WAR to end all Wars"" and those English chaps that survived were tagged ""the living dead"".With so many of their chums falling around them,those that survived often felt guilty that they had survived and often were treated as such by the countless families who had lost a son. Thus we come to A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY which concerns itself with one such young man,simply called by his last name,Birkin(an endearing Colin Firth),who has ""physically"" survived the War albeit with shellshock,ticks and stutters. Birken has received a commission from an ancient Yorkshire Church to uncover a 14th fresco (that has been hidden  for 5oo years above the nave)) much to the Rev. J.G.Keach's consternation ( a very stern Patrick Malahide).Birkin is greeted with anything but Christian charity and compassion by the Reverend Keach,yet Birkin is there to do the job and has to accept sleeping in the Church belfry. What transpires over a summer month is a very precise and mystical transformation in Birkin's soul as he lovingly and painstakingly removes years of paint to uncover the fresco so long ago covered up. We watch Birkin's icy and troubled heart start to unthaw with every scene as he allows the warmth and kindness of those in Yorkshire,the Rector's wife(Natasha Richardson), and another War survivor/casualty working as an archaeologist  at the Church,Moon(Kenneth Branagh),as more and more of the ancient painting is revealed. Even physical renewal comes to Birkin allowing the nervous ticks to disappear day after day.
This is a rare piece of filmmaking!!!! The story is about inner transformation, and much of what the viewer takes from this film is captured in the long gazes into the eyes and soul of Birkin and the his relationship with the painting. The script has minimal dialogue and much of what is uncovered is through the media of outstanding camera work coupled with  music,both secular and religious. to explain what is happening inside Birkin. This is a quiet,deliberate and very pensive movie,almost best if watched in complete solitude. The film clocks in around 90 minutes,but seems so much longer in the good sense! In the USA the film is only still on vhs,but it is a marvelous print and completely worth your time and money. A PAL dvd has been released. 5*'s is not sufficient to rate this haunting tale of restoration of the soul.
In conclusion,as magnificent as the short novel is, this movie actually does an amazing job at not only following the book practically verbatim,but illuminates parts of the book that could merely be described that even rivals the book itself!

Midsummer's Night Dream"" which was performed by half a dozen of the people we now call ""stars"".  Branaugh, Richardson and Firth are now stars, but ""A Month In the Country"" shows the budding talent of these people twenty years ago.

The script, from a novel by J. L. Carr, tells the story of two young middle class professionals who have just returned from service on the British Front during World War I and have become very underemployed in the postwar economy.  They each have scars, one, the art preservationist, has a tick on one side of his face (changed to a stutter in the film) and the other, the archeologist, carries shrapnel in his leg.  However, beyond that, they each have others scars, not so obvious, which they have brought home with them. The work they are doing involves the grave in unconsecrated ground and a church painting showing the Judgment which has been whitewashed over in the sanctuary of the estate church.  Their salaries have been left in a bequest by one of the most recent generation of the family which owns the estate.  She was what some people in the 1920s called an eccentric and some called a new woman - not afraid of facing the truth or unearthling family skeletons (Sorry I couldn't resist that).  What each of the men finds, as they do their work, about the deceased and about themselves, makes for a fascinating story and makes one wish deeply that these men, who gave so much, will continue on the road to healing which their discovery has started.  The third character of importance is the rector's wife.  She is young and beautiful and married, for some reason, to a man much older than herself.  She is also a bit lost in her life, but, somehow, we know she will not change and will spend the years ahead on the same road she is now traveling.  Unlike the men, she has not faced death on the Western Front, and therefore feels she has a lot to lose by taking a chance on life.",1174521600,6,1975,4.4860335195530725

In fact I pulled it off my bookshelf tonight to watch following the viewing of a popular film from last year (supposed to be so great and funny, but wasn't!). Because I totally felt cheated,I needed movie satisfaction tonight. This film is one I have now seen several times and it gets better with each viewing. Subtle details are noticed. Unfortunatly I own the VHS, but would love to purchase the Region 1 DVD version; I keep looking and hope it becomes available soon. This shows just how much I value this film, that I would buy the DVD in a minute.

First, the acting is superb. Colin Firth and Kenneth Branagh turn in such touching, yet quiet performances. There subtle communication is wonderful and sensitively handled. It is what is not said or said between the lines that counts. Their understanding of each other is perfect. Their separate personalities play well off each other. Natashia Richardson is excellent in the role of the stifled vicar's wife. She and Colin have wonderful eye chemistry. Expressions are everything and this little film proves it. All the actors turn in marvelous performances. The children are great. This film does not rely on fancy special effects or elaborate sets, but rather truly fine and talented performances that seem so real and authentic, and will hold up with time. I would highly recommend this film to anyone. It is slowpaced and thoughful, but not at all boring. I loved the beauty of the English countryside and the mysteries of the tombs and the church mural. Themes are layered and revolve around the main characters and their haunting war experiences. The end is perfect. I don't want to give it away.

341232,3,630165160X,"The 1980s was a decade of costume dramas, with Merchant Ivory as the quality benchmark.  Surprisingly perhaps, it was the Edwardian era (1900-1920-ish) that seemed to be the most popular period. Award-winning TV series Brideshead Revisited pioneered the movement but it was Oscar-winning Chariots of Fire that opened the floodgates, and suave young men in stripy blazers and floppy haircuts reigned supreme for ten years. Merchant Ivory of course pretty much cornered that market with  Howard's End, Room with a View, etc. but there was no shortage of contenders to the English Costume Drama throne. A Month in the Country capitalised on the seemingly neverending demand for soft-focus costume movies, and indeed, the usual crowd of young, arty film-goers of the mid-80s, me include, lined up for tickets. The story - based on the novel of the same name - sees shell-shocked World War I survivor on an assignment to a remote (and of course idyllic) Yorkshire village to uncover a mediaeval mural in the local church. So far so good. Colin Firth puts an tastefully understated performance as the well-spoken Charles Birkin, while Kenneth Branagh, Jim Carter, Patrick Malahide, Natasha Richardson and just about every other ubiquitous British actor add their own special touches.  To be brutally honest, however, nothing much really happens. Passions are thwarted, loose ends are left untied and feelings slowly simmer underneath phlegmatic British exteriors but everything remains unresolved.  In short we are left with an overwhelming feeling of anti-climax. Even the drama is deliberately toned down, suggesting perhaps that Month in the Country would have come across better on television - perhaps as a series.  A very nice movie, but a blockbuster this most definitely is not.",1070582400,23,1780,5.275618374558304

7813371,4,630165160X,"I ordered the movie after reading the magnificent novella by J. L. Carr. The young Colin Firth (Birkin), Kenneth Branagh (Moon), and Miranda Richardson (Mrs Keach) are perfect in their parts, and the whole thing is beautifully filmed in the Yorkshire countryside. A special feature is the use of existing music (I think I caught Vaughan Williams and some Tallis) that exactly fits subject and period. Any fears that the film might coarsen the quiet understatement of the novel are entirely unfounded. ""Understatement"" here is itself an understatement; the strongest emotions are conveyed in silence; Miranda Richardson is especially poignant in this regard.

[The one exception (and this surprised me) is the soldier Birkin encounters in the York cafe, who tells him about Moon. In the book, as I recall, it was handled with some subtlety; here, it is merely vindictive and frankly unbelievable.]

Carr's novella is short, but In order to give the movie the space it needs, much has had to be cut. Birkin's relationship with the Chapel folk, for example, is greatly abbreviated, and that final harvesting scene has been omitted. As for the mural Birkin is supposed to be restoring, the painter hired by the film company has done a terrific job, but by the same token, what you see is what you get; you are not left with the idea that this is a work of blazing genius, as is possible when all you have are the author's words.

One warning: while of good quality, this video does not come with the trappings of a commercial release. The image is rather boxy, and there are no subtitles (at least none that I could access). Given that many of the characters, especially the children, have strong Yorkshire accents, this makes it all but incomprehensible at times. And the pervasive understatement in both Branagh and Firth's delivery makes for a lot of tailing off and murmuring. Not therefore recommended for the hard of hearing!",1498953600,3,1927,4.886850152905199
7813372,5,630165160X,"A Month in the Country is one of the truly great films.
The First World War, and its tragedy and senselessness, permeates the film.
Into rural England comes a shell-shocked restorer of paintings (Colin Firth)to recover a medieval wall of a church
whose rector is a stuffed shirt, and whose wife is a charming, young woman (Natasha Richardson) who helps bring back the artist
through her innocence. Another layer of richness is added by another affected vet (Kenneth Branagh), an archaeologist living in a tent
on the church grounds who, because of the war-trauma he experienced, sleeps in a trench within the tent. They strike up a friendship which is fed by the depth of the culture and civilization that they are recovering. This civilization stands in stark contrast to the insanity of the war.

As though this weren't enough, the two unexpectedly solve the mystery of the author of the wall painting. The scene where the painting
begins to appear from under the layers of covering is mesmerizing, as are so many other encounters in this masterpiece.

MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I DIDN'T GET A DVD WITH SUBTITLES. If anyone has such, please get in touch.
