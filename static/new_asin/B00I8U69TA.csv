8639917,5,B00I8U69TA,This DVD goes through the basic massage techniques every parent should incorporate into their relaxation and bonding rituals with their baby.  The baby reacts so positively to the stimulation and I can clearly see why these techniques should become a necessity for every new parent.  LOVE IT!  I can't wait to incorporate a daily infant massage and stretch routine with my newborn.,1402272000,,381,5.112903225806452
8639918,5,B00I8U69TA,"This DVD is awesome! Very easy to follow I started using it when my son was six weeks old and he loves it, particularly the leg and arm massage moves. I actually use it as part of his nighttime wind down relax routine every night for about five minutes before he goes to bed and it helps a lot to get him relaxed and ready to sleep!",1400976000,,332,3.970149253731343
8639919,5,B00I8U69TA,Just when nothing else seemed to work.  I gave this DVD a try and it was God answering my prayers!  Thank you for allowing my baby and I to finally get some sleep!,1400976000,,163,3.909090909090909
8639920,5,B00I8U69TA,"I am so glad a friend gave this to me.  Just when you think you're doomed to a life (or a year but it seems like a lifetime) of crying baby, someone give you a new and effective tool for settling your baby.  All three of us are much less stressed out and can enjoy these magical times together.  Nuala loves the gentle touch of massage.",1399939200,,336,4.0606060606060606
8639921,5,B00I8U69TA,"I have nothing to compare this DVD to other than to tell you that my daughter, out of desperation, bought it!! Not only did little Lucy calm down (both her system and her sweet fearful heart) but my daughter relaxed as she massaged Lucy. The instructor's voice is very soothing, the instructions are simple for a stressed out parent to comprehend and it works!  fabulous find and excellent DVD. Thank you.",1399852800,,405,4.704225352112676
