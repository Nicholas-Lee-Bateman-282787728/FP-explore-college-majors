Don't waste your money. This instruction is beyond horrible- these 'skills' require fine motor skills (which you lose in an sns activation), lots of practice, and a wimpy and cooperative opponent.

It's also hilarious how the instructor talks- it's as if he is reading from que cards and trying to let you know it.",1404864000,,482,4.593023255813954
