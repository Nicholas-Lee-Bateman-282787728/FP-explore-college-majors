8414376,5,B0043988LM,"If you love one piece then you should be getting all of the dvd sets. It is one of the best animes out to date. If you haven't heard or seen it and are interested, it is a great mix of action and comedy. The main character tries to fulfill his dream of becoming a pirate king, fighting anyone that threatens his freedom along the way. He gains friends/crewmates that end up having bad pasts (like being a slave) and helping them to realize their dreams too. The art style is close to DBZ, since the creator modeled the main character after DBZ's main character.",1313193600,,561,4.352380952380952
8414377,4,B0043988LM,"God Eneru's Survival Game is finished, but his threat to the Skypeians and Shandians is far from over!  Before departing for Fairy Vearth, Eneru wants to erase all traces of his occupancy of Skypeia, and that means the destruction of everything and everybody.  After demolishing his old palace, Eneru sets his sights on both the Skypieans' town and the Shandians' village and prepares the Raigou, an immense black lightning ball, to vaporize them.  However, ""God"" has to deal with some resistance from the Straw Hat Pirates first.  Luffy poses the biggest problem (because he is made of rubber, Eneru's lightning doesn't hurt him).  Luffy, on the the other hand, is hurting Eneru plenty.  Finding himself unable to overpower Luffy, Eneru resorts to new fighting tactics (focusing his Mantra to dodge Luffy's blows and burning him with a golden trident heated by his energy).  Finally, Eneru ""rewards"" Luffy for a good fight by attaching a huge gold ball to his arm and pushing him off of the ark.  Nami gives herself up for lost, preferring to die rather than give her devotion to Eneru.
But Eneru's troubles aren't over.  Sanji and Usopp regain consciousness after Eneru's attack on them.  Upon seeing Nami on Eneru's flying ark, Sanji goes into chivalry mode and rushes to rescue her, dragging a reluctant Usopp along because he needs Usopp's octopus grappling hook to board the ark.  While Usopp distracts Eneru with a fake show of power, Sanji sabotages the ark, forcing Eneru to go below deck to fix the damage while Sanji, Nami, and Usopp make their escape.
Little fazed by the escape of his captive, Eneru proceeds to launch the Raigou at the Skypeian town.  The town is destroyed without a trace, fortunately, Conis has succeeded in convincing the people to evacuate before this.  The Shandians have also fled their village and upon meeting the Skypieans, declare a truce in the long standing conflict between the two peoples as they now have a common enemy in Eneru.  Now willing to trust the Straw Hat Pirates and Gan Fall, Wyper tells them the story (which spans for 3 episodes) about the friendship between the Shandian hero Calgara and the explorer ""Liar"" Noland.  In particular, Wyper descibes a huge golden bell in the city of Shandora whose ringing brought hope and joy to all who heard it.  Luffy figures right away that if Noland's descendant Cricket were able to hear this bell, then he and everyone else on Jaya would be convinced that Noland was NOT lying about Shandora.  Luffy sets off to search for the bell to ring it.
Unfortunately, Eneru (greedy for the last bit of gold from Shandora) is also searching for the bell and seems sure to grab it before Luffy can get to it because it is on a cloud that only the ark can reach.  Together, however, the Straw Hats and Wyper work out a plan to reach the bell and stop Eneru's destructive rampage.
Predictably, there is a happy ending.  Eneru is driven away before he can destroy Upper Yard, the Skypieans and Shandians make peace, Cricket and the Jayans hear the tolling of the bell, and the Straw Hat Pirates leave with a shipload of gold that the Shandians let them have in gratitude.  Robin also finds another Poneglyph and discovers that the Pirate King Gol D. Roger had also been here to read it.  Robin discovers from this Poneglyph that in reading the other Poneglyphs in the world one could find the way to the Rio Poneglyph that will reveal the true history of the world that the World Government is so determined to keep hidden.  The Straw Hats find their way back to the Blue Sea at last and quickly find out that they are not yet out of trouble!

Next: Trapped in a Marine base and the land where everything is loooooooooonnnngggg.",1284681600,6,3714,4.706336939721793
