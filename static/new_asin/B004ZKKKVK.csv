4510213,5,B004ZKKKVK,"My girls are 4 and 6 and they love this movie.  I think the idea of always wanting for something better was a gret topic for their age.

Looking forward to Little Drummer Boy in October!!!!",1315180800,4,189,4.222222222222222
4510214,2,B004ZKKKVK,"We were excited for this newest Veggie Tales movie because it's geared toward girls. We've really enjoyed ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"" and had similar expectations for ""Princess and the Pop Star."" Unfortunately, the story just wasn't very cohesive -- they really tried to fit too much into a short time -- and the ending in particular left something to be desired with one girl (named Princess) failing to realize the error of her ways until her little brother found his wee vegetable self in a perilous situation that she rescued him from. The jokes weren't there, the religious subtext was overly preachy, and the songs weren't as catchy as those in Pirates. Even my little girl didn't care for this video.",1313971200,4,715,4.821138211382114
4510215,4,B004ZKKKVK,"We love VeggieTales and is always exciting to see what they come out with next. Having two daughters it is great to have a girlie episode every once in a while. The Princess and the Popstar is a great colorful story with fun new music. A ""freaky friday"", ""grass is always greener..."", and ""the prince and the paulper"" story to show these two girls that they are better in their own lives just as God created them. Already my toddler has requested we watch it multiple times. So glad she enjoys something of worth.",1313712000,10,513,4.468085106382978
4510216,4,B004ZKKKVK,"Princess Poppyseed (Laura Carrot) is not happy with her life on the farm.  She has too many brothers and sisters and doesn't like her chores collecting the eggs and milk that her family uses to grow pies.  Princess wishes she had the life of her favorite singer, Vanna Banana (also Laura Carrot but a different voice actress).  Vanna, meanwhile, is lonely and wishes she could have a normal life.  When the two meet by chance on a playground, they decide to switch lives.  But will that bring them the happiness they are seeking?

Maybe I was just being dense, but I was glad to see that they had named one of their main characters Princess and that was how they were ripping of the title of Twain's famous book.  Once I got that down, I was able to get caught up in the story.  They were a little preachy in the middle, but that didn't last for long.  Unfortunately, the ending didn't live up to the rest of the video.  It was way too cheesy and drawn out.

For the silly song segment, Archibald comes out and gives us some fashion history with ""Astonishing Wigs.""  This one is fun for the ending more than the song itself.

Speaking of the songs, I did enjoy the music here more than in the last few VeggieTale releases.

This isn't a bad entry in the DVD series, but it has certainly lost the spunk it used to have.  Still, kids should enjoy it, and that's the most important thing.",1313366400,6,1385,4.35546875

4510271,5,B004ZKKKVK,We have this DVD at my church library.  It is a favorite with the kids.  One little girl checks it out over and over so I purchased a copy just for her.  The story is told in a sweet and humorous way.  I enjoy watching it myself.,1391990400,3,229,3.8085106382978724

4510278,4,B004ZKKKVK,"My daughters love princesses. My sons love watching the pogo stick go through the wall and the cow kick things over. I enjoy the idea of planting milk, flour, and eggs, and getting a pie tree to grow from it. The main characters were engaging; I found it easy to empathize with both Princess and Vanna (the pop star). It's a good movie, very enjoyable, but not one of the Veggie Tales movies I can enjoy watching more than two or three times in a month. Perhaps it's just that the silly song is so weird -- Astonishing Wigs isn't a bad song and video, it's just weird (especially the pigs, which made a great comeback as actual characters in the new House That Stood, but were just unsettling in wigs), saved only by Larry's comments to Archibald in the silly song wrap up. Overall, I enjoy it a lot, just not as much as a few of the other Veggie Tales movies.",1371081600,,860,4.282208588957055

4510293,4,B004ZKKKVK,"A good lesson in being who you are.

Great work VeggieTales making a very high quality video and music DVD for young girls!

4510298,5,B004ZKKKVK,"I was skeptical that my son (5) would like this since it is geared toward girls. but I am glad I took a chance and just like every Veggie tales video before, it did not disappoint. It has actually turned out to be one of his favorites! Its hilarious when he is dancing around the living room singing the Vanna Banana songs!

If you are skeptical to go watch the ""Best Friends Forever"" Silly song on youtube!  Adorable.",1359158400,2,418,4.346153846153846
