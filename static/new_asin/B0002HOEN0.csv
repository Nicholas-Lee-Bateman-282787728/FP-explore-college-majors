8028033,1,B0002HOEN0,"This review is for the quality of the Ground Zero DVD ""The 18 Secrets of the Yangtze presents Billy Chong: Kung Fu Executioner & Sun Dragon"" I would probably give the movies themselves more stars ( but not by much. The fighting choreography is top quality but the production and script are terrible )

Both movies are very poor quality and I suspect Ground Zero got them by downloading low quality prints off of the Internet. ""Kung Fu Executioner"" is from a low quality pan and scan print which Ground Zero blocked out the top and bottom to fake it being letterboxed. Let me make this clear. The reason why you letterbox a video is because you are trying to fit a picture which is longer than it is taller into a square TV screen. Widescreen movies are called widescreen because they are wide. In the past tv stations and video companies cropped off the sides of the picture so it would fill the entire screen without leaving a blank space on the top and bottom. The reason why letterboxing a movie is now desirable is because it allows the viewer to see the entire movie frame. When someone put ""Kung Fu Executioner"" onto videotape they cropped off the sides so it would fill the screen. Whatever was cropped off the left and right was gone forever. When Ground Zero blacked out the top and bottom it did not bring back the missing part of the picture but instead further removed parts of the picture.

""Sun Dragon"" was from a print that was letterboxed. But it was given a brand new English dubbed soundtrack. I suspect the reason for this is that the source print was from either a French or Japanese laser disc that did not have an English track. The new dubbing seems to have been done by one person who does all the voices.

The copy I bought could not be played on most DVD players without it freezing or cubing.",1281744000,,1819,4.440119760479042
