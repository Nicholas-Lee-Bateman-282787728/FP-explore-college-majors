8368952,4,B00007H002,"In this day and age of musicians who look like boring, ordinary, everyday dudes on the street, it's refreshing that some bands still know what it means to be real Rock Stars! They puke, they drink, they sign autographs on girls breasts, and they're glammed out to the max! That's right, they wear make-up and turn their amps up to eleven!
  Robin Black, Killer Ky, Starboy, K-Tron, and newest member, B.B. McQueen are a breath of fresh air in a world of watered down, tired, average, ordinary rock star wannabes. Of course, the best way to experience a band like this is on DVD. The videos for ""Some Of You Boys and Most Of You Girls,"" ""So Sick Of You,"" and ""Take Myself Away"" seriously rock and the behind the scenes footage and band interviews are very interesting. There's also some intimate, live footage of various club performances that are way cool! The editing is a bit choppy at times, but that doesn't detract from the awsome spectacle of these five Canadians that, as an american, I wish I could say were from the U.S.A.",1059436800,,1031,4.5675675675675675
