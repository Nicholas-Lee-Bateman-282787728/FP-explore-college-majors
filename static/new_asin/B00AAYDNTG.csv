8549471,5,B00AAYDNTG,We have been visiting Acadia National Park for twenty years and have quite a collection of books and DVDs about this beautiful paradise. We were pleased to discover that the photography and quality of this DVD is truly outstanding! This DVD is so well done that we feel like we are really in the park while watching it. The musical accompaniment perfectly compliments the scenery. We ordered three more copies for our friends as soon as we got home because of it's quality and price. I would highly recommend this DVD if you want to relive or discover the sights and sounds of Acadia. You won't be disappointed.,1383782400,,611,4.666666666666667
