5721981,3,B00CGN72KK,This was great - a new spin on arms and toning without tons of equipment or high weights - very clear instruction,1388016000,,113,4.181818181818182
5721982,5,B00CGN72KK,"Why did I wait so long to buy this DVD?! It is awesome. I loved Suzanne's Gorgeous Core, and I was afraid they would be too similar, but they are not! The few moves that are similar are varied enough here to be different (adding a knee down or a hip move). Also, the music on this DVD is more low key and mellow than Gorgeous Core.

This was filmed in Suanne's new studio where she films all her streaming workouts. It's a very nice, clean, uncluttered studio with the barre along the wall (she uses a chair instead of a barre in the stretch) and her SBf logo on the wall.

Intro - Suzanne gives brief descriptions of each segment, talks about modifications, and asks that you include the warm-up and cool down in your workout.

Warm-up (2 min) - Very short, but to the point. Mostly knee ups and twists with arm motions to warm you up quickly.

Lower Body Lean (22 min) - Yowzers! I used 3lb weights, but you could use less or none and still feel the burn. Exercises include: plies with alternating heel ups, knees back, pulses with heel ups, and both heels up for balance; lunges with pulses, then heels up for balance; seesaw with taps or kicks, and other balance moves. Repeat on other side. Next, you work hips and move in to side lunges with pulses and holds. Then, you are on your knees for knee dancing. Last is seat work and inner thighs. On all fours, lift one leg in the air for circles, pulses, and holds. On one side, hold a weight on the inner thigh while you lift and hold.

Upper Body Sleek (21 min) - I didn't know 3lb weights could be so heavy! Exercises are: pushups and pilates pushups, forearm planks (forward and back with alternating knees down, then double knees down), side forearm planks with hips down and reaches under and up, and reverse pushups (triceps dips?).  Then you stand on your knees and work shoulders, chest and back with lots of different kinds of movements. It's harder than it looks!

Cardio Torch (23 min) - Suzanne is wearing very lightweight looking shoes here, but I just stayed barefoot and used my mat to give me some traction. She states that this is a cardio interval workout, and that you will go back and forth between sculpting moves and cardio moves. Start in pli, stand with leg in, stand with leg lift, then you pli while heart rate recovers before repeating on the other side. Next is lunges with different variations and arms. After that, you do pli jacks, deep, then quick and light. You finish with core work - crunches, twists, bicycles, holds, bridge.

Stretch (12 min) - The stretch is awesome. She uses a chair in this one. Start on the knees with side stretches, neck stretch, triceps stretch, and shoulder stretch. Next is lower body - hamstring, runner stretch (with advanced modification - ahhhhh). Then hip stretch, spinal twist, parallel legs, butterfly, straddle (or sitting angular).

I love Suzanne Bowen, and I can't wait for her new DVD's to come out this January!",1386288000,40,2940,4.52165725047081
5721983,5,B00CGN72KK,I could not love Suzanne Bowen and her workouts any more than I do! This DVD is no exception. It can be curtailed to whatever level you are. She makes working out fun. The shorter segments are great to get a little workout in when you are tight on time. Her demeanor is so pleasant and pointers come right when I need them. I highly recommend this fabulous DVD!!!!,1384732800,3,364,4.2898550724637685
5721984,5,B00CGN72KK,"Suzanne Bowen is a very likeable instructor. She's precise and gives great form pointers. As for the workout, I felt it in those small movements. This is a nice addition for those who like barre-type workouts but want something different. Each section can stand alone or put all 3 together for a burner. I appreciate the pick and choose option. The upper body section is intense and I used only 3 lbs weights. There's a lot of shoulder work here. The lower body section didn't feel as difficult but interestingly I really felt it in my muscles later. And the cardio - well that one sneaked up on me. It seemed easy until she started doing wide plie jumps. There's a bunch and they fry the legs. The stretch is nice and plenty long without being rushed. It's not my most intense workout but I wouldn't call it a light day workout either. It's great for days when you don't feel like jumping around - except for those darn plie jumps. I've used over 500 workout dvds and this one is a keeper.",1380931200,13,990,4.415300546448087
5721985,5,B00CGN72KK,"I'm not going to lie, this is not the type of workout I would enjoy. I have a couple pilates dvd's at home that I do sometimes (mostly Ellen Barett) but enjoy trainers like Jackie Warner, Cindy Whitmarsh and Jillian Michaels. I didn't realize this was barre based when I bought it. For those new to barre  the workout will require some extra time watching the moves before you can perform them. A lot of the arm work is in plank position on the floor so it's hard to watch and do the moves at the same time. After doing the workouts a couple times a person would become familiar with them. Overall though I feel like this dvd will provide a great workout for someone who enjoys this style, that's why I am giving it 5 stars. I felt as though I should review so others can decide whether or not this would be for them.",1375315200,36,817,4.203821656050955
5721986,5,B00CGN72KK,"I discovered Suzanne recently on YouTube and liked her personality so much that I purchased two of her DVDs (this and ""BarreAmped"").  I haven't done the cardio section as I rely on Jessica Smith's low impact walks to cover that but I've done the other two on the disc repeatedly and can only say that the results were pretty instantaneous.

The lower body lean segment seemed slightly easy compared to other videos but my legs are much stronger and even caught the notice of a usually distracted boyfriend so I'd say it's definitely worth the effort!  Suzanne does a variety of moves involving plies at different angles, see-saws for rear hamstrings, ""knee dancing"" for the thighs (I feel those!) and then moves on to the glutes and a short bit for the inner thighs.  Not too difficult but you get a bang for your buck.

Upper body sleek was a different story.  The bodyweight only exercises were quite challenging; however, I've been doing them following 20 minutes of Leah Sarago's upper body moves in her ""Ballet Body: Total Body"" video and since they were very similar I'm guessing I was too burnt out.  Whatever the case, Suzanne does a lot of shoulder work involving forearm planks then transitions into side planks that work your waist, shoulders and back.  It's not easy and even she stresses that you should listen to your body.  She finishes with tricep dips before moving onto the weighted section.  At that point 3 pounds was about all I could handle and even then I had to stop once or twice.  She focuses on the shoulders, triceps, middle back and more but I never thought 8 reps of one exercise could cause so much muscle trembling!  It works, though, and her ""shake to change"" motto is no joke.

Suzanne is a very pleasant instructor who is not a drill sergeant or too perky.  She packs a lot into the two segments I've been doing and there is no dread factor (or annoyance factor in her case).  I like that she incorporates stretching into the upper body workout; Leah Sarago doesn't give you a break but Suzanne does.  I've very happy with this purchase and would buy additional videos by Suzanne in a heartbeat.",1434672000,13,2130,4.625
5721987,5,B00CGN72KK,"Absolutely LOVE this dvd!!!  Suzanne is awesome in explaining the movements and giving instructions on form and all that.  Super challenging workouts but after doing these for a while I can feel the difference in my flexibility, my muscles lifting and toning and my overall energy.  The cardio segment is super intense but so effective.  I could say I'm addicted to these routines!",1432080000,2,381,5.0

5721992,5,B00CGN72KK,Very good. Some of the upper body is too hard for me but generally excellent.,1427328000,,77,4.2
5721993,5,B00CGN72KK,"This is a great set of workouts that doesn't involve a bunch of flailing and dancing around, which I appreciate. Even if I'm a little low on energy, I don't dread doing this DVD, but I still feel like I accomplished something.  My body is changing after 2 weeks of doing 1-2 segments of this video 4-5 times/week.  I really love Suzanne as an instructor. She's calm but still very motivating.  She says things like, ""Could you go an inch lower?"" in a way that makes you think that maybe yes, you could, even though you feel like you're dying.  I was tempted to skip the stretch segment at first, but after trying it, I now love it.",1427241600,7,631,4.322033898305085
5721994,5,B00CGN72KK,"I have Suzanne Bowen's 10 Minute Abs dvd, and like it so I took a chance on this DVD, and think it is excellent.  The torch routine will definitely raise your heart rate and make you sweat.  It that way, it is challenging.  However, one of the reasons I like it is that it is not dance oriented - no complicated steps or fast rhythms.  If you've been doing some aerobic work and want to step it up a bit, I'd recommend this dvd.  If you are re new to fitness, it would be a challenge, but something to aim for.",1427241600,3,510,4.00990099009901
5721995,5,B00CGN72KK,Love this DVD! I think Suzanne does a great job in getting all those trouble areas as well as making the work out kind of fun.  I feel great after her workouts!!,1425340800,,161,4.03125
5721996,5,B00CGN72KK,"I bought this postpartum, as I had used Suzanne Bowen's Long & Lean workout during my pregnancy. This is a great workout and I'm very happy with my purchase! There are 3 workouts--an upper body, a lower body and a cardio segment. Right after I had my baby I did just one segment, which is about 20 minutes. Now that I have a little bit more time, doing 2 or all 3 segments during one workout is awesome! There are modifications for beginners and more advanced participants, which is great. It gets my heart rate up, and I can really feel it in my muscles. Even with my newborn-induced sporadic workout schedule, I'm seeing results and feel great! I would definitely recommend this workout as it will boost metabolism with all of the strength training and also work on cardio with fun and challenging exercises.",1424044800,,810,4.593103448275862
5721997,5,B00CGN72KK,"Love this video!  Looks easy, but is very effective and what a great instructor!

5721999,5,B00CGN72KK,Excellent  DVD . Total body workout. I own several DVD from Suzanne and this one did not disappoint me.,1412640000,,103,4.421052631578948
5722000,5,B00CGN72KK,"Instructions clearly explained and she is very likeable, however don't expect a sweat drenched workout as other cardio based exericse.",1409097600,,134,5.75
5722001,5,B00CGN72KK,"So I am on a barre kick these days after having spent many years doing heavy weight lifting and intense cardio.  I love to radically mix things up and keep my body guessing.  I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser.

This offering from Suzanne Bowen has four sections:

Upper Body Sleek  (20 minutes)
Lower Body Lean (20 minutes)
Cardio Torch (20 minutes)
Stretch (12 minutes).

You can choose to play all sections or just pick and choose the ones you want.

This workout sneaks up on you and before you know it, you are sweating and burning.  This is all in a good way, of course.

Why I love this workout:

* The Upper Body section.  Most barre workouts mainly focus on the lower body.  Sure, you may have a few arm exercises with teeny weights for the warm up and some plank work, but then you're on to the lower body.  For this section, I was using 2 pound weights and my muscles were screaming!  And this, from a person who can normally do bicep curls with 17.5 pound dumbbells.  Of course, I wasn't doing many, many reps with no rest.

* The Cardio Torch section.  Too many years of high impact jumping has taken its toll on my joints.  I love having a workout that gets my heart rate up there, but doesnt torture my joints.  At the end of this section, I feel very energized and ready to take on the day and not exhausted like I do with intense cardio.  Suzanne alternates lower body moves with low impact cardio.  My leg muscles thanked her for the alternating moves!

* The tough plank work in the Cardio Torch section.  I hate planks, but I love what they do for my core, so I struggle on and do them anyway.  The side plank series, with a leg lift was particularly challenging.  Im glad Suzanne provided an alternative move.  Even when I did the alternative move, I couldn't keep up with all the reps.  This is something for me to work towards.

* The clean, uncluttered set.  Suzanne is by herself, with a studio background of light blonde wood.  I feel  relaxed just looking at the set.

There are a few things to note about this workout.  I loved this workout so much, that they didn't affect my rating, but I wanted to mention them.  The few things are:

* The Lower Body Lean section didn't seem as hard as the other two sections.

* The too long pauses between sections.  At the start of each section, theres a black screen with the title of the section.  This is show for several seconds.  I felt it broke up the flow of the workout.  I wanted to keep my heart rate up, so I marched in place, but it was mildly distracting.

* Its just Suzanne demonstrating the moves.  Some folks may miss the energy of having background exercisers to watch.

If you are looking for a fun and effective barre routine that works you, this may be just the thing for you!",1394236800,18,2776,4.319066147859922
5722002,5,B00CGN72KK,"The instructor is clear and gives excellent instruction. I am someone who hesitated doing Barre type work because I thought you could not get as good results from this type of movement as you do from HIIT type workouts. Am I ever glad I gave it a try....my body is in the best shape ever and no pain anywhere. I feel so calm and energized after doing this Dvd. I have done everyone out there from Cathe, Tracey Anderson, Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, p90X.....Suzanne Bowen is at the top for being creative, enthusiastic, form focused instructor...you will leave feeling good and empowered. You will not regret getting this Dvd or anything else by Suzanne Bowen.",1393286400,12,662,4.765217391304348
