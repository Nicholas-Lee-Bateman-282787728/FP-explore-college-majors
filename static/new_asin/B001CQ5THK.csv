3515574,5,B001CQ5THK,"What an incredibly funny, yet meaningful message.  Glenn's ""campaign"" speach is exellent.  Well done Glenn!  (he reads his reviews, you know...)",1219363200,10,144,5.761904761904762
3515575,5,B001CQ5THK,"This truly was one of the best things I've ever witnessed. The first hour is a stand-up act with a strong political bent. The second half is Mr. Beck's ""stump speech"" - that is, if he would actually save our country and finally run for president already! I laughed, I cried. Beck is hilarious, honest, and heartfelt in his delivery. I left the theater in which I watched this ready to write in Glenn Beck's name for president. I'm not kidding - I just might do it.",1219104000,18,464,4.344827586206897
3515576,5,B001CQ5THK,"What can I say?  Glenn is a patriot to our country and truly cares about America.  If you want proof, buy this DVD.  I was at the live show in Houston and just being in such a mans presence makes me proud to be an American.  Patriotism is contagious and Glenn is spreading it like wildflowers.

Thanks Glenn for what you do for America!",1219104000,16,336,4.1875
3515577,5,B001CQ5THK,"This show was a true inspiration for me, surrounded by politicians who lie and then lie about the lie and are reduced to playground antics of name calling, to see that I am not alone just wanting to see American stand up to the people who feel entitled to the power and say, ""Just stop it!""  Very funny and has touching moments in it as well when introduced to the lone survivor of his SEAL team from Afghanistan.  I found myself wishing our elected officials would have the courage to speak their beliefs like Glenn AND Americans would embrace them for it.  This show illustrates the Politics need not be so serious.",1219104000,19,617,4.491071428571429
3515578,5,B001CQ5THK,"Saw it live, then took two friends and my son to the cinematic version.  Even for those that haven't put a lot of thought into this election cycle, this will go a long way towards getting them engaged.  Everything he says makes so much sense you can't help but start nodding your head.  It's like he channeled my every thought.  When you're done watching it, you'll feel frustrated, uplifted, depressed and motivated all at once.  It'll make your head hurt, but in a good way.",1219017600,33,476,4.552941176470588
3515579,5,B001CQ5THK,"We saw the simulcast of this show in the movie theater.  I wish every politician was forced to sit still and watch this show!  He says what I would like the chance to say if I had access to the ""powers that be"".  Not only is he funny, but he is dead on with his commentary on politics and how disconnected our politicians are from ""their people.""  HOWEVER, if you prefer to keep your head in the sand, and believe that if we gave ""the world a Coke"" we'd ""live in perfect harmony"" - save your money.",1219017600,43,498,4.103092783505154
3515580,5,B001CQ5THK,"I saw this show live. It was so much fun and so funny that I also wanted to see it in the movie theater but couldn't. I'll be purchasing this DVD so I can watch and laugh over and over again. This election season never seems to end and a little humor certainly can't hurt. Glenn is a true patriot, is hilarious and someone every American should listen to or watch - regardless of political party affiliation. To quote Glenn, ""it's not about right and left but right and wrong.""  Unfortunately the politicians and party leaders have forgotten that fact, which is why most people are sick of them all. Glenn's speech in the second half of the show leaves you yearning for an honest politician that just wants to do what's right for America. Glenn bashes both political parties so don't let his conservative leanings stop you from watching this DVD or his television show.",1218931200,45,869,4.57051282051282
3515581,5,B001CQ5THK,"If you're a thinker (or want to be)- this is totally for you.  Glenn is a true patriot and a beacon on a very dark night.  You'll think it's just a comedy show, but you might actually want to vote for President Beck when you're done watching.  Heartfelt, true and things we need to hear.  God bless you, Mr. Beck and THANK YOU for brining this message!",1217808000,39,352,4.208955223880597
3515582,5,B001CQ5THK,"Glenn said everything we want to hear from politicians. It would be nice to get someone who would talk straight to us in Washington. The truth in what he says, the sensitivity in which he says it, and the humor of his delivery, makes Glenn Beck a must see! Watched this live in theaters and LOVED IT! Can't wait for the DVD!!! Thanks Glenn!!!",1216944000,38,342,4.359375
3515583,5,B001CQ5THK,I purchased this to see what Beck does besides his radio show. It's really funny. I highly recommend getting it if you have only listened to Glenn on the radio.,1390953600,,160,4.366666666666666
3515584,5,B001CQ5THK,"I did not expect much, but I laughed so hard I had an asthma attack! Glenn Beck fans will surely love this and others might as well.",1386892800,,132,3.925925925925926

3515586,5,B001CQ5THK,Loved this.  It was as good as the first one.  He is one of the few people in this country who are still speaking out for freedom and damn anyone who tries to stop him.  I will buy anything that he puts out.,1369958400,,207,3.7674418604651163
3515587,3,B001CQ5THK,"I bought the first Unelectable in 2008 on a whim and it made me laugh until it hurt.

I hoped for a similar experience with Unelectable 2012 and was dissappointed.  Much of this I had heard on Beck's radio show and felt like a rehash.  Althought the mock debate was entertaining, it was not nearly as funny or personal as Beck's 2008 show.  Beck is a powerful speaker however, but overall I came away dissappointed.",1358208000,,415,4.493333333333333
3515588,4,B001CQ5THK,"Very well done spoof on the election process.
Really enjoyed watching this show.
Some of the bits were hilarious.
Worth the time.",1357689600,,129,4.909090909090909
3515589,4,B001CQ5THK,"This is the first live show I have seen, and, as my son remarked, he almost thought he was watching a real debate.  One candidate answered the questions (Glenn) and the other obfuscated with the ""press"" fawning all over that one.  Glenn also did speeches before and after the debate.  It's why he's ""unelectable"".  He really is more concerned with actually solving the problem.",1356220800,,377,4.84375
3515590,5,B001CQ5THK,I love hearing the truth so boldly put!! Hopefully America will wake up and smell the crap that Mr . Obama is dishing out.,1355702400,4,122,4.125
3515591,5,B001CQ5THK,Glenn is always forthcoming and very inspiring... he reminds me of a preacher we had 40 yrs ago -- one who would tell you the truth about events and inspire you to do the best you can with your own God-given talents.,1353715200,4,216,4.166666666666667
3515592,5,B001CQ5THK,"Glenn Beck makes fun of political correctness in this DVD of his stage performance before the 2010 election. Everything he says is so true, but it clearly makes him ""Unelectable"", because no one who is frightened by the ""politically correct"" atmosphere we live in would vote for him. Very good comedy. Recommended",1353715200,,313,5.038461538461538
3515593,3,B001CQ5THK,"The film is a live show of Beck in a beautiful theater in San Antonio Texas. It begins with a mock debate between the ""president"" and his ""opponent"" - who is played by Glenn. The moderators are two men who are very biased toward the left, and support everything the president says, or rather doesn't say. The whole time the mock president is basically filling time with thank you's and talking points completely unrelated to the question (""I authorized Seal Team Six to go after Osama Bin Laden don't you know?). Then Beck counters with very well thought out arguments, although sometimes I found myself cringing at some of the jokes, because they made him sound exactly as some democrats must view him - uncaring about some very touchy subjects.  I did like a lot of his points, because he mainly stuck to the topics of immigration, oil, terrorism, and the economy. He didn't go near abortion or gay rights, except the mock president did have a quip about including transgendered individuals, which I would actually find admirable so it wasn't really funny.

  The second half of the movie is when my feathers got a little ruffled. He started talking about the founding fathers, and a lot about god. His main point was about the rivalry but mutual respect that existed between George Washington and Thomas Paine. He stressed that although we are different, we can still respect each other as they did. Ok, that's fine. However, when telling stories about the two founding fathers, he embellished a lot in reference to the men's faith. I have yet to do more research, but from the little I have done on the faith of the founding fathers I know that none of them were Christians. Most of them were considered Deists, which molded well with their dedication to Freemasonry. Beck made it sound like Common Sense was written as a Christian text, but Paine was not a religious man. He quoted the Bible in Common Sense because the people could relate to it and had a general understanding of the text. See [...]

  Beck states as fact that Washington prayed to get across the Delaware safely, and a miraculous fog that looked unlike anything they had ever seen before appeared in the area where the men were and allowed them to cross. If you read about the faith of George Washington here : [...]. , it is clear that he was neither Christian nor an absolute Deist. So whether he prayed or not is debatable, seeing as how he advised others not to pray but to simply accept ""divine providence"".  Did god help them cross the Delaware? Maybe. Could it have just been foggy? Yes.

  The founding fathers were against organized religion. Considering Beck is a member of a very organized faith, I wonder if he has studied the faith of the founding fathers, and the foundation of his own religion with any sort of scrutiny. The founding father ideology he champions publicly and the one he lives by in real life are paradoxical. The only relation between Mormonism and the founding fathers is Freemasonry.

  Beck's faith promoting story about Thomas Paine is what really got to me. He stated that he and Washington had a fall out because Paine ""went all atheist on him"". Thomas Paine was not an atheist:

  ""The fame of being a godless atheist followed Paine like a shadow forever afterwards. But the punch line in all of this is that Paine was anything but an atheist. It was precisely because he believed in God that he despised organized religions since--in his view--these turned the divine mystery into bad mythology, and projected onto God their own psychotic hopes and fears. In Paine's brand of freedom-loving spirituality, God was something greater than any religion. And this was the belief that cost Paine his place of honor among the founding fathers."" - Quote from an article found here: [...]

  Beck tells the story of Paine's imprisonment in France and says that the day before he was to be executed God saved him, because even though he was an atheist, he was still a patriot. How did god save him? By giving him a cold so he would have to go to the infirmary. The same tags they put on the door for a sick inmate and an executed inmate were the same, so they all thought he had been executed. This didn't make sense to me, but we obviously aren't suppose to think too hard about it. Also, couldn't Paine have just gotten a cold all on his own without god giving it to him? Could it just be dumb luck?

  Lo and behold, a quick google search provides the answer to how Paine really escaped imprisonment in France. James Monroe bailed him out. [...]

  At the end Glenn Beck said something I really admire and agree with. ""Just be yourself, don't try to be anyone else. Be who you were meant to be."" My question for Mr. Beck is this: ""If I  (hypothetically) were to tell you that I was born to be a lesbian feminist freethinking atheist liberal, would you still be advising me to be myself?""",1348272000,2,4894,4.5954022988505745
3515594,1,B001CQ5THK,Glen Beck is proof that there is a large segment of the population in extreme need of a class on critical thinking. Beck is a vile and destructive talking head.,1348012800,2,160,4.366666666666666
3515595,5,B001CQ5THK,"my husband and i are very big fans of Glenn Beck - he says things that many of us are thinking, but are maybe too afraid to say (especially if we were in the spotlight as glenn is).  Many of us know that this country is no longer run by the Constitution of the United States - our country has been taken over by greedy politicians (this also includes other professional people, such as doctors, lawyers, CEOs, etc.) who want us to believe that they have our best interests in mind, when in fact they only have their own interests in mind for their own families and friends.  The greed in this country could very well cause us to lose our freedom.  Glenn reminds us that it is not the government in this country that will keep us free, but it is what is in our Hearts and Minds that will give us the freedom that we have had for so many, many years.  I give Glenn Beck a continuous A+ !!!!!!",1304640000,2,890,4.156976744186046
3515596,5,B001CQ5THK,"Glenn Beck is a wonderful entertainer but even more so, Glenn is an honest, moral and intelligent man.  This DVD shows his tremendous ability to be both humorous and educational at the same time.  I love his sense of sarcastic humor!!",1266105600,,234,4.682926829268292

3515599,4,B001CQ5THK,"This was taped in Texas during Glenn Beck's tour last year. Those of you who watch/listen/read Glenn with any regularity will recognize most of the sentiments shared. I did find it an interesting look at his ""stage"" presence with props and showmanship - which is a bit different than watching him behind the desk at CNN or Fox. I enjoy watching him because he is not completely ""Republican"", but asks that most people just have common sense. I was a little turned off by the fact that he curses several times during the presentation, but nothing so rampant that one feels it's the only vocabulary he utilizes.",1242777600,,609,4.700934579439252
3515600,5,B001CQ5THK,This is commentary masked as comedy.  The video of his road show is one of those rare videos-the more you watch the more you get it.  He makes fun of all things political especially the pandering politicians do to get us to vote for them.,1236470400,,238,4.266666666666667

3515604,3,B001CQ5THK,"Glen Beck is familiar to most, certainly to me.  I was slightly bored in the beginning, but because I stuck it out for the first 20 minutes, I was treated to the end and best part of all.  He allows us to see his teary side, as well as the comedic side, from the heart of a man who truly cares about America.

3515609,2,B001CQ5THK,"Glenn Beck is one conservative I'm pretty much unfamiliar with. I'm a big Mark Levin fan but had only seen Beck in cable snippets. I heard good things about him though so I gave this video a gander. Politically, he and I are on the same page, but, while I completely agree with his worldview, I do not find him funny. He's just not a natural comedically. Much of his shtick was very hokey and his jokes beat you over the head. His act was banal and fairly low brow in my opinion. He didn't challenge and managed to bore. Sadly, I turned it off after an hour. I'll gladly watch him conduct interviews or take calls from viewers, but I don't think his future is in standup. I wish Glenn good luck though.",1225584000,4,702,4.246268656716418

3515611,4,B001CQ5THK,The first half of the show was ok.  I liked the second half a lot.  I really like his CNN show and was happy to get a chance to see him in a comedy show.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a Glenn Beck fan.  It is worth the price.,1225411200,,236,3.480769230769231

Glenn likes to refer to himself as a clown, but actually his clownishness (is that a word?) is used by him to help us swallow the bitter pill about the truth of what has happened to our Government and political system. The total absurdity of the PC and political left is brought to light when Glenn tells the story of his trying to build a fence in his Conn. neighborhood, and the absurd laws that have been enacted from CA. to PA.  There is even an impassioned plea at the end to us as Americans to ""Learn"" from our founders and what they had hoped for us... Even made me a little misty...",1224547200,,650,4.241935483870968

3515636,5,B001CQ5THK,a must see before the election! Lots of common sense is dished out here. Highly entertaining and at the same time so many hard truths and realities about the state of our country,1223769600,,178,4.424242424242424

3515638,5,B001CQ5THK,"On the man: this guy has so much compassion, so much drive, he is real and that kind of ""real"" is near impossible to find these days. Glenn has got it right and has been nothing short of honest in sharing his concerns for America, and sharing his love for his family and their futures. He is the last of the patriots.

On the dvd: the show started off a little awkward for my taste. I have trouble finding the ""git r' dun"" type redneck humor funny due to it's broad over uses in the States. Yet that was just a short opening to much grander and much more humor packed stand up.  Many times I was caught off guard by sharp wit. Near the end he become VERY intense and human. Glenn will knock down the walls you have in daily life and hit the nail on the head. I watched this with 3 other people and we all got a lump in our throat each at differnt points, one even cried. This dvd may have started out a 2 star but man by the end it hit gold.

3515639,5,B001CQ5THK,"This is Glenn at the top of his game. I was stirred. I laughed. I was challenged. I was appalled. I was inspired. I was proud to share the country with this man. I was proud to agree with him. I was even happy to have spent my money on the DVD. Go, Glenn, go!",1222646400,,259,3.727272727272727
3515640,5,B001CQ5THK,"My husband and I saw this show in Columbia, SC. I wasn't really a Glenn Beck fan at the time. Only took the first five minutes of the show to change that. Yeah, we had some laughs over the state of politics in our country, but there was much more to it. I remember leaving the show that night being very proud to be an American! And now I'm truly a fan!!",1222041600,2,354,3.9305555555555554
3515641,5,B001CQ5THK,"Everything he says is right on target with what the problems are with this nation. He makes perfect sense in a humorous way. WE are the solution to the problems, Not the overspending, Overtaxing, Overstaffed, Corrupt Government. The people made this nation and it is time to re-build it.

For those of you that hate this movie or have a problem with Glenn Beck. You are part of the problem, so get out of the way!!! It is time to change the way Politics is done. What is being done now is not the answer.

Hate Speech, lol. Get a real life and move to another country where your wanted. We've had enough.",1221868800,3,604,4.336283185840708
3515642,5,B001CQ5THK,"What a refreshing event.  I loved listening to a man express himself with comedy and common sense.  How can anyone who sees this say that Glenn Beck is a man of hate?  Quite the opposite.  He is a breath of fresh air, with no ""political correctness"" stirred in to flavor the monologue.  Thanks to Glenn for this fantastic addition to the spice of our times.  I strongly believe everyone in America should watch this video and pass it along to as many Americans as possible.",1221868800,2,473,4.5058823529411764
3515643,5,B001CQ5THK,"I saw the stage show in Springfield MA.  Glenn rips both political parties and their candidates by illustrating common sense examples.  Included are the bureaucratic hurdles of trying to make home improvements in a state like Connecticut up through major boondoggles in Washington DC.

In the second half, Glenn puts on the dark suit and power red tie, gets in front of a huge US flag (his lapel pin) and just lets it rip from the lecturn.

On TV you can occasionally see a shot of Glenn's pitchfork collection, (which listeners send in much to the chagrin of the CNN mailroom).  After watching this show you will be ready to get yours ready too!",1221782400,13,646,4.631578947368421

I recommend everyone to watch this - have fun!",1221523200,7,213,4.526315789473684
3515647,5,B001CQ5THK,"I saw Glenn's simulcast in theaters.  Absolutely amazing.  I came there with the expectation that it would be a semi-decent show with a few laughs.  I figured it would be very similar to his radio show which I enjoy.  However, I walked out of the movie theater after laughing hysterically, being scared out of my mind, and crying like a baby.  I'm not easily moved and this beautiful piece of art has moved me.  Thanks Glenn.  The world needs to see this video.",1221177600,16,461,4.481927710843373
3515648,5,B001CQ5THK,"Glenn Beck did an excellent job culminating humor and message.  This should be required viewing in all schools (as the ""Fair and Balanced"" opposition to Keith Olberman's thought that Obama's speech should be required viewing).  Glenn let's us know what it is to be an American and anyone who watches this will be indebted to him for doing it.  In a world where the tyranny of stupidity and the corruption of politics is at its worst, Glenn Beck lays it all out firmly and concisely.  If a candidate were to give a speech like the one Glenn gives in this show, and he did it with the same caliber of heart, I believe I speak for anyone who watches this, they would have our votes.

Everyone should view this, if nothing else, rent it.",1220745600,10,733,4.440298507462686

3515650,5,B001CQ5THK,"My husband and I watched through the broadcast to a remote theater and loved it!  We are buying the video to share with family & friends.

This show is a great reminder of what this country & it's citizens ""should"" stand for, reminders of what we all want (but never hear from anyone ""representing"" us), and the fire reignited for us to take back the country from those who don't listen to us.

If you are anything like those of us who sat in the theater, you will be compelled to stand and cheer just as much as you fall down laughing.  Enjoy!!!",1220054400,10,546,4.271844660194175

Show it to everyone you know!
