1843560,4,B00008G697,Don' listen to the Yankees fan it's a great movie that all can enjoy. The Red Sox are better than the Yankees this year and proved it by beating them 4 in a row after losing 3 in a row. World Champions don't cheat like AROD.,1099094400,11,224,3.891304347826087
1843561,5,B00008G697,"This is a great DVD for its intended audience, the Red Sox fan. Yankees fans would probably be smart not to waste their money. (And oh yeah, about that curse thing-- who's laughing now?)",1099008000,10,186,4.5
1843562,4,B00008G697,"I thought this DVD was well worth it.  History was well presented
(I didn't know the club started as the Boston Pilgrims) and the film and still pictures were very good.  Definitely hit all the memorable highlights of this great ballclub.  A must have/see for Red Sox fans though I recommend it for any baseball fan.  Overall, very good.",1076803200,14,337,4.661016949152542
7982756,5,B00008G697,"This is without a doubt for me the best program I have seen on the history of the Boston Red Sox. I have seen a couple of others but this DVD is very complete in covering the first 100 years of the Red Sox. Best of all it presents the history of the club in chronological order right from the beginning when Boston was chosen to be one of the original teams for the newly formed American League in 1901 right on through to 2001. In between looks at the important moments in the teams history as well as look at the careers of some of the greats who would don a Red Sox uniform from Cy Young to Smoky Joe Woods to Babe Ruth to Harry Hooper, Ted Williams, Dom DiMaggio, Yaz, Carlton Fisk, and Padro Martinez and a few others too many to mention.

For the die hard and maybe even just the casual Red Sox fans will love this. There are a lot of moments covered here from the team's past that will bring back fond memories for many as well as reliving those moments that brought heartache. But through it all it still makes for an excellant time to watch. Do note this DVD is three hours in length so you may want to break up viewing it into smaller segments. Also know since this covers just the first one hundred years of the BoSox there is no mention of the Red Sox winning the 2004 World Series ending once and forever the dreaded curse of the Bambino nor their championships in 2007 or 2013. They would occur after the DVD was released. One would hope that a few years down the road the producers might do an updated companion disc covering the More recent events that occurred. But even if they don't this is still a great compact disc to get either for yourself or anyone you know who is a big time die-hard fan of this team. I wholeheartedly recommend this video!",1476230400,,1766,4.224852071005917

7982759,5,B00008G697,Excellent video to entertain and depict the Red Sox history. The length is just right and enjoyable. Must for any collection.,1361318400,,125,5.0
7982760,5,B00008G697,"I am a lifelong Red Sox fan and this movie is a great historical record of the ball club and its long history.  Everything good the other reviewers have said is 100% true.  But it should be noted here somewhere that this was made in 2001 and therefore does not mention either of the Sox championship victories in the 21st century.  That said anyone looking for footage of the '04 and '07 team victories will not find them here.  The film is also somewhat lengthy and may prove tiresome at one setting for anyone who doesn't desire to learn all the history at once.  There are some great player profiles on Ted Williams and Captain Carl, among others.  And it's interesting to see the changes at Fenway Park and improvements in television technology as the years progress.  I found nothing wrong with the announcer.  Great for any Red Sox fan and ideal for younger fans who may not know all the history and would like to see some of the legends they have only heard about in action.",1238371200,2,981,4.47191011235955
7982761,5,B00008G697,"As a life long fan of the Boston Red Sox (I'm 71), this DVD is just outstanding!! I recommend it for Red Sox fans of all ages!! You won't regret buying it.",1171065600,,155,3.875

7982763,2,B00008G697,"I stoked when this DVD came out originally, however, it could have been better.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I'm a Red Sox fan for cryin out loud.  My expectations are obviously going to be high.  This was produced by the NESN (New England Sports Network) at a time when John Harrington was owner. I've never liked the NESN projects and now prefer to buy MLB videos.  The narrorator was the most difficult thing to deal with in this movie.  He sounded like Alan from Late Show with David Letterman.  Don't get me wrong, Alan rocks, but you can't stand him talking for three straght hours on a subject he knows very little about.  That's what this narrorator was like.  The second problem was there was no building of emotion like some of the other videos produced by mlb.  For example.  It just give you a nice and tidy presentation on how the Red Sox made it to the 1995 divisional series with no explanation on what happened in the postseason.  The friggin post season!  We don't care what happens during the regular season as much as the postseason.

With the growing popularity with bandwagon fans of the Red Sox, I really hope that MLB will create a one or two disc dvd that will be much better depicting the Red Sox history much similar the the NBA's Celtic Dynasty DVD set.  MLB does a great job with their dvd production that I think it would be great.  SO write to mlb and tell them what we really need rather than this garbage.",1115078400,11,1450,4.418867924528302
7982764,5,B00008G697,"I'm deaf and a diehard Red Sox fan... so I want to know if this DVD has any closed captions. Thanks!!!

My rate (5 stars) isn't true because I'm writing here for get the info of the CC. Sorry!",1108512000,,192,3.923076923076923
7982765,5,B00008G697,"I am a long-time Red Sox fan, but I feel that this DVD is great for anyone that is a true baseball fan. I work at Fenway Park as a Tour Guide and I find that many people that participate in the tours are quite interested in the Boston Red Sox and their history, even some Yankee fans. So, even if one isn't really a fan of the Boston Red Sox ball club, if you love the history and the game of baseball, you should very much enjoy this DVD.",1100995200,14,439,3.888888888888889
