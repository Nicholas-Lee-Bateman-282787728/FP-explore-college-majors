3985735,5,B002TQKL16,"Becker; was the best TV series for six years. I have purchased each season that has come out each year. I am not sure why Amazon or CBS does not bring the last three seasons out all this year, but this is my big wish.

This program has the same political issues and work, family and friends that never get old or stale. It is a true ensemble show. As I watch it I always find something to laugh at.  I do not get any of these classic TV shows in my area so I really enjoy the DVDs.

There is no extras so don't expect any frills, just fun. I highly recommend.",1263427200,7,559,3.9292035398230087

If you need a laugh that continues through the whole program, do yourself a favor and get this great program.

3985859,5,B002TQKL16,This show is hilarious. I love watching this show. Whenever I watch it I always end up laughing hysterically. Just waiting to buy season 4 & 5 of this show. I would recommend this show! Great buy!,1416787200,,196,4.324324324324325
3985860,5,B002TQKL16,I never watched this show when it was on prime time but started watching this show on re-runs and fell in love with the show. One of my top 5 tv shows.,1408838400,,151,3.75
3985861,2,B002TQKL16,"I enjoy this show but I am very surprised at how expensive this Season is.  Also why doesn't it have the ""Play All"" or ""select episode"" options.  This review is solely based on these two reasons.  The show itself is 5 stars in my opinion.",1407888000,,238,4.2444444444444445

3985864,5,B002TQKL16,Love the character Becker.  Like Ted Danson a lot in most things.  I find it relaxes me to watch  one or two comedy episodes just before bed.,1391904000,,141,4.148148148148148
3985865,5,B002TQKL16,This DVD is a riot. Becker is so crude and rude. The cast is amazing. Good for a good laugh.,1386115200,,92,3.65
3985866,1,B002TQKL16,"Love Show - Hate Disc - Poor Quality! I've gone through two different Disc Sets for Season's 4 and 5 and in each set there are at least two of the three Disc that have damaged episodes. The damage is so back that nearly half to three quarters of the episodes on two to three episodes can't be viewed. Circular scratches are clearly visible and cover a long circular recorded area. Though Amazon is great about their return policy, having to go through the ordering and returning in attempts to get a good quality product is ridiculous. I have other CBS DVD recordings that are great, so don't know why these particular Becker Sets are so poor in quality.",1384646400,4,654,4.504201680672269
3985867,4,B002TQKL16,"Dysfunctional, anti PC, Cigarette smoking, male chauvinist pig, jerk.  What's not to like?? Excellent acting.
Worth watching once a year (along with Season's 1 and 2).",1375833600,2,167,5.423076923076923
3985868,5,B002TQKL16,This season is definitely one of the best of the Becker series.  Over twenty episodes of Dr. Becker poking fun at one crazy member of society after another.  Great fun!!,1368230400,,169,4.6
3985869,5,B002TQKL16,This show is SOOOOOOOO funny!!!!!!! I already have seasons one & two and look forward to obtaining season four. Ted Danson is certainly versitile!,1364774400,,146,5.125
3985870,5,B002TQKL16,"I watch this EVERY NIGHT while in bed, it relaxes me. Danson & all the others actors are a great mix. Nobody else could play the role of Becker but Danson. He was better in this than in Cheers. It's funny, funny, funny! Buy it.",1364688000,,227,4.066666666666666
3985871,5,B002TQKL16,This is definitely one of the BEST shows that have ever been on television.  I watch it over and over again and enjoy it each time I view all the shows again.  Top of my list comedies.,1361491200,,184,3.945945945945946

3985873,5,B002TQKL16,This is another funny season of what may have been the most politically incorrect sitcom of its time.  Becker has hit its stride by Season 3.  Highly Recommended.,1360368000,,162,4.75
3985874,5,B002TQKL16,I bought the third season DVD of Becker for the Christmas show.  It is hilarious!  I highly recommend the Becker series.,1359158400,,120,4.666666666666667

3985876,3,B002TQKL16,Not the best quaility discs that we are used to receiving from Amazon.  No problem with the sale or delivery.  I guess I just need to live with the bad spots on the discs.,1358380800,,171,4.0

3985898,5,B002TQKL16,"Becker - a laugh out loud sitcom - he's rude, crude, and yet he has a big heart - and the supporting cast is funny - good writing and directing -
This, in my opinion, is Ted Danson's best role.
He exposes the crankie, cynic in us all.",1291852800,2,234,3.8958333333333335
3985899,5,B002TQKL16,"I pretty much cannot stand Ted Danson personally. I don't like his politics or just about anything else about him, but he is a very funny actor and this series is hilarious. I never watched it when it was on TV (because I don't like Ted Danson), but when the series ended, I walked in one day and my teenage son was watching an episode, so I sat down and grudgingly watched with him and was roaring with laughter. So now we're collecting the show on DVD and each season has been really great. Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to laugh.",1282953600,3,544,4.29126213592233
3985900,5,B002TQKL16,Another great season of the doctor whom everyone gets on his nerves.  I am always laughing when it comes to this show.  Becker and the gang never dissappoint.,1277510400,,158,4.607142857142857

3985902,5,B002TQKL16,"I think Becker is a show that deserves appreciation from every angel. He is a practical man, that doesn't know how to hide his feeling and expresses them even if they are hurtful, actually, this is a good kind, because most people nowadays are two faces.
This show is funny, and the chemistry between the characters is strong and makes it even funnier.
Season 3 starts off with ""The Film Critic""; which is funny and talks mostly about movie theaters and how people can't seem to find peace there. The season ends off when Becker tries to help his patient and advices him to go to the gym and even goes with him, but the patient has a heart attack and instead of thanking Becker he sues him, and Becker's practice would seem to be on it's way to end.

You've gotta love this season, it digs deep into the relations between the characters, Bob becomes the Super and Reggie dating experience and Margret's husband relation.

I miss those Sitcom days, where every episode used to be funny.
Long live Becker.",1272931200,5,1003,4.535911602209945
3985903,5,B002TQKL16,"A modern day curmudgeon.  A doctor who hates everyone, everything, everywhere and all the time (but with class)!  Funniest show since ""All in the Family"".",1268438400,2,154,5.12

3985905,5,B002TQKL16,I only wish they weren't so long time in coming. I am looking forward to the rest of the seasons.,1268092800,,97,3.9
3985906,5,B002TQKL16,"Everybody thought ""House M.D."" was such an original show when it debuted in 2004 with its wise-cracking sarcastic Dr. Gregory House. Though this was more of a drama, nobody seemed to realize that Ted Danson is the one who made that popular, way back in 1998 as Dr. John Becker.

""Becker"" is one of the funniest shows ever to hit TV, but sadly some casting changes and other behind-the-scenes squabbling brought the show to a slow demise after about six seasons. Ted Danson gives some of his best work here. If you think the rants of Dr. Cox on ""Scrubs"" are funny, just wait until Becker storms into his office ranting about the bums on the street, the city health department, the justice system, humanity in general or any one the upteen-million things that seem to make him angry.

The true heart of this show is it's sheer originality and unique characters - Becker's dim-witted female assistant, Linda, could have been a walking cliche were she portrayed by a busty blond, instead she's portrayed by the raven-haired Shawnee Smith (of ""Saw"" fame) with perfect comedic timing; Margaret is Dr. Becker's nurse, a heavy-set Bible-thumping black woman who is the perfect opposite of Becker's in-your-face sarcasm, anger and rants against God and religion; then there's Jake, Becker's blind best friend who, although he becomes the butt of many jokes, holds his own as one of the show's leading men; there's Reggie, the middle-aged ex-model turned diner owner who can't get a date despite her drop-dead gorgeous looks; and Bob, the fast talking nitwit who annoys everyone yet manages to remain an appealing part of the show. Other characters constantly move in and out of the show with many famous stars making guest appearances.

Naturally ""Becker"" falls prey to many common sitcom gags and it's formula never really changes, which makes it a bit redundant after a while. Still, it's not one to miss!",1264723200,16,1898,4.888198757763975
3985907,3,B002TQKL16,The DVD disk picture is very good except for the small white blocks at the very top of the screen that flash on/off.  Very distracting.  Was it a bad transfer to the DVD disks?,1264032000,2,176,4.147058823529412
