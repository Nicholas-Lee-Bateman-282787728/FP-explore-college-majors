8240292,4,B00114OFLO,Interesting historic film made by Goebbels as anti-British propaganda and how the Imperial British Empire crushed the Boers in South Africa as they sought to expand their empire. Ironically Hitler was trying to do the same with Europe and the Soviet Union.,1526083200,,256,5.119047619047619
8240293,4,B00114OFLO,"Yes, it's a Nazi propaganda film, but it's historically accurate as far as it goes, with great production values, outstanding characterization, and a focused narrative that transcend its immediate purpose.  The standard conception of ""totalitarian propaganda"" is heavy-handed, wooden, and ideological.  Yet Reichsminister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels studied and modelled Nazi cinema on Hollywood methods; avoiding cliches, presenting desired official views as entertainment and historical dramatization.  There's even a 1930s dancing number with leggy girl Boers!  Although Tobis producers couldn't resist a Nazi-style parade in Boer costume, with youth drummers and banners marching through the streets of Pretoria, received by Ohm Paul on his balcony as the reluctant war-fuehrer.

The purpose was to demonize England through the ""Volkampf"" of their cousins of a previous generation, investing the Reich's current war with the moral capital of the Boer struggle against British empire.  The film had an underground appeal in South Africa as Germany sought (successfully) to organize a local Fifth Column in the British rear.  Its portrayal of blacks is patronizing, yet not really bad considering the norm in American period culture: little comic racism and even a sense of dignity in the African warriors roused by the British.  There's bitter irony in the film's last quarter (and of course no sense of it) as Jan Kruger's house is burned by an officer in commanding German, exactly as was being done throughout occupied Europe.  The concentration camp scenes are over the top, with a German-barking commandant endorsing death rations and disease, hanging prisoners and shooting them outright.  Even so, the konzlager depicted here seems humane compared to those being stuffed at home by Dr. Goebbels' fellow ministers.

I give it four stars as a good portrayal of the Anglo-Boer conflict, its imperial overtones still with us in the guise of ""humanitarian intervention.""  Those of the Western world community espousing its values would do well to recall the lessons here, when again wondering why ""they hate us.""",1514937600,,2119,5.486153846153846
8240294,5,B00114OFLO,"This classic film (1941) certainly has sustained itself as it is very interesting to view even after 75 years from its origin. Historical drama depicting the events of the second Boer War. Yes, it was made in Germany during the war with anti-English tones. However, reading other materials on the Boer War reveals that this film is more accurate than the British could be comfortable with. An excellent film both for the subject matter and as a piece of cinematic history on its own.",1490400000,,483,4.761904761904762
8240295,5,B00114OFLO,"The DVD was enjoyable throughout.  The Boer war is the history covered, and we don't get a lot on that in the U.S.  Aside from that, the anti-British theme throughout the movie is WILD!  The sight of Queen Victoria swilling scotch found me laughing, and the exchanges between Kruger and an oily Cecil Rhodes are just GREAT!",1484438400,,323,4.631578947368421
8240296,5,B00114OFLO,"I originally became interested in ""Uncle Kruger"" -- 1st President of South Africa -- when I researched a number of sights and destinations in this country. It is a fascinating story that involves one of many conflicts between ethnic Germans and the expanding, ever-hungry British Empire.

For those not in ""the know,"" the film ""Ohm Kruger"" (""Uncle Kruger"") was made in 1941 as what people today would call a ""propaganda"" tool. However, to the German film industry that made it, the film represented a chapter in the history of ethnic Germans living in South Africa of which they proudly stood against British expansion. The heavily Dutch/Belgian/German/Prussian population that established itself, did so in a manner of cooperation with the local Africans. In direct opposition, is the antagonistic manner of the encroaching British, which duped the African populace and then armed them and used them as canon fodder in what is today known as the Boer Wars. In subsequent British tradition, they naturally enslaved the Africans afterwards and started a horrific pattern of this throughout the rest of their empire. Any guesses on who invented concentration camps? If you answered ""England,"" you'd be correct, and they did so to starve as many of the captured ethnic Germans as possible when British money and political power proved to overwhelm Kruger and his countrymen.

But enough about history, let's see how good of a film this was. In short, there is a certain ""clunkiness"" to films of this era that is to be expected. With slightly choppy editing and sound levels as well as often-wooden acting, I just don't expect a lot when viewing a film of this age. However, ""Ohm Kruger"" will surprise you in this respect. It is an extremely satisfying quality film and I am pleased with the overall product. The battle scenes are terrific considering the technical difficulties of making a war film especially of this style 70+ years ago. The film is effectively paced through the build-up to the inevitable conflict between the German/Dutch/Belgian/etc settlers are the invading British -- financed behind the scenes by the one and only Cecil Rhodes.

I found the dialogue terrific and the acting mostly pretty good. Emil Jannings however, plays Uncle Kruger and he is head-and-shoulders superior for that time. He gives a very gruff, passionate performance and it would be great if he were credited more for it. Although the scenes featuring British conspirators moving towards their objectives in South Africa can seem a little contrived, they actually aren't. It was for all intents and purposes, the financed brain child of Rhodes with the blessing of the English crown. This aspect is slightly difficult to follow because the film is spoken in German with English subtitles. Once or twice, I was a tad confused as to who was being featured: English characters or Germans?

The film does have a very honest, hard-edged conclusion (for those who have studied the Boer Wars) as the ethnic Germans are rounded-up into concentration camps and at the mercy of the invading English. Several of the actors show their talents in this tragic conclusion, which I feel is a credit to Hans Steinhoff's direction.

Yes, you certainly catch (at several junctures) the overriding message of ""England vs Germany"" as applied to WWII while watching this film. However, if it is generally historically correct, that doesn't make it vicious or hateful. Taken for its own merits, ""Ohm Kruger"" is certainly one of the better-quality films of the early 1940s that I have seen.",1451779200,6,3555,5.059726962457338
8240297,5,B00114OFLO,"The tale of the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa seldom receive any attention, even though the British Empire committed massive war crimes against the Afrikaner people.

I see in the description of the movie it is made off as anti-English propaganda. However, this is one of the only internationally produced films that speak the truth.

5 out of 5 for this masterpiece",1382745600,17,374,4.920634920634921
