7977154,3,B00007JZUU,the movie was not like I expected.  It was too over the top(example the nude house cleaner stealing everything that was not nailed down in sight) in some parts and pretty much unbelievable in other parts.  The story line was disjointed and way too many issues.  I would not recommend this movie.,1373500800,,295,4.634615384615385

vol 2 but still awful waste of my money",1220918400,,110,4.45

Hollywood Stories is entertaining fluff, to be sure, but it's

entertaining GAY fluff, and sadly you won't find any of these stories

on your daytime soaps. The writing/the acting/the camera work--no worse

than you'd find on Days of Our Lives, which is to say it's not

brilliant, but I didn't find a single ""bad"" performance, and some of

the actors are actually pretty good, and pretty good looking, and a

pretty face can excuse quite a lot. More than anything, West Hollywood

Stories is a tantalizing peek at what might be if prime time, or even

daytime, paid more attention to the 10% focused on in this ""what if""

soap. Too bad that only four episodes were made. I'd like to have seen

more of these stories",1140307200,5,784,4.649635036496351

The story stinks (what was it about again?) and the acting is just plain lousy!!! DO NOT spend your hard earned money on this or the West Hollywood Stories 2 movie. Spend it on a classic like ""Sunset Blvd."" or ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" or, if you're hungry to see hot men, go to the baths.",1081641600,3,470,4.119565217391305
