8358651,5,B0029Z8KD8,"No problems with the dvd's playing. Very good viewing quality. I didn't know Lone Wolf and Cub appeared as a tv series. I had only heard of the movie starring Wakayama Tomisaburo which we viewed long ago. This tv series stars Yorozuya Nakamura, and he does a fine job. This review is for collection 1 of season one. You would need to purchase collection 2 to view the remaining episodes of season one.

FYI: If anyone is looking for the complete Seasons 2 & 3 of this tv series I ordered those via japanesesamuraidvd dot com. Just be aware that the picture quality on those is not at great (still viewable though) as this tv series collection I'm reviewing.",1502928000,,657,4.5210084033613445

8358656,5,B0029Z8KD8,"Lone Wolf and Cub Collection 1 and 2 together comprise season 1 (April through September 1973) of the TV-serialization of the manga of the same name. The show originally ran over 3 seasons (1973, 1974, and 1976). Each season aired 26 episodes. The gap between the last two seasons was due to waiting for the manga to complete its serialization in the ""Manga Action"" magazine.

The TV stories generally follow the manga. The story's setting and principle characters are identical. However some TV episodes combine elements from different subplots in the manga. Readers of the manga (I own the entire series) will notice, and perhaps agree with, the screenwriters' adaptations.

The video quality of the DVD release is not stellar. Film scratches and color fading are apparent. The overall experience is satisfying.

The original TV program in 1973 was a big hit. Schoolboys would pretend to be swordsmen. I felt left out because I was unable to watch the show (I was sent to bed before the show started at 21:30 on Sundays). Truth be told I would not have understood the story then. Complex emotions and motives were out of my grasp at the time.

One bonus feature I wish Tokyo Shock would add to the DVD release is a re-run of the TV ad for instant curry. A comedian impersonating Ogami Ittou would put a pouch of heat-and-serve curry in hot water, and admonish his son Daigoro ""sanpunkan matunodazo"" (""wait 3 minutes"") in a deep raspy voice. We thought that was hilarious!",1298764800,21,1473,4.78740157480315
8358657,5,B0029Z8KD8,"This Live Action TV show, is quite similar to the movie series, with a couple reused story lines. Fans of the movies should definitely check these episodes out.",1294099200,5,160,4.75
8358658,5,B0029Z8KD8,"I was happy to see this collection on the dvd shelf because I really want to buy the series, but kept putting it off because of the price of the previous releases which only had two discs per release.  With this release, there are six discs, and cover the first three volumes of the previous releases.

There is a debate between which is better, the six movie series which starred Tomisaburo Wakayama, or the television version, which starred Kinnosuke Yorozuya.  And to be honest, I like both equally.

While the movies combine some of the plots of the manga, each episode of the tv series cover one storyline. The premise, in a nutshell, is official executioner for the shogun, Itto Ogami, is framed by the Yagyu clan, and instead of committing hara-kiri, escapes and raises money to someday exact revenge on the Yagyu and restore his family's name.  He raises this money by becoming a hired assassin, traveling with his three year old son, Daigoro.

The relationship between father and son seem stoic, but there is a clear bond between the two.  Ogami is an assassin, but it seems he only kills bad guys.  It is these two factors that make these episodes work. He puts his son in constant danger, but you forgive him because of the life he leads. He kills people to earn money, but you forgive him beacuse of the people he kills.  They live a brutal existence, and you root for their survival.

Kinnosuke Yorozuya is a much more soft hearted Ogami than the one Wakayama plays in the movies, and what's really impressive is the blend of being stoic and showing affection for his son and showing emotional compassion towards his clients all at the same time.  As far as the action, it's classic chambara tv action.  Certainly not on par with what Sonny Chiba would do a decade later with the fight choreography, but on level with what you would have seen in any other samurai drama.

This collection has the first 13 episodes of the show.  No extras, just the episodes and some movie trailers of I suppose movies that are part of the dvd library of Tokyo Shock.",1259452800,28,2062,4.583106267029973
