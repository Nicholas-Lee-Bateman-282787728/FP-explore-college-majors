9397,4,076780192X,"G'day from Australia, when l found out about the ""Collectors Edition"" being released, l couldn't wait to get acopy. Close Encounters won't be released here in Australia for quite some months! so thanks to Amazon.com l received a copy from USA, which plays very well on my system here, it was so good to see all the scenes that are removed from the ""Special Edition"" but l hoped, l really hoped that because it was called the ""Collectors Edition"" it may include the Special Edition ending sequence as well, but no, l don't know why Steven Spielberg, or whoever, didn't do us fans a favour and edited it all together..oh well it is good to have the Orginal release in the library non the less..Clint.

9407,5,076780192X,"A favorite movie of mine. I grew up with it. For better or worse, movies like this and ET made me mistrustful of the government at a very early age. The adult me can also relate to the story which involves a man who abandons his loud kids and nagging wife to fly away away (to who knows where?) with a bunch of aliens. Oh, and it looks good in HD too.",1518480000,,351,3.888888888888889
9408,1,076780192X,"With  'Close Encounters', simply surviving the opening scenes at Roy and Ronnie Neary's home, with their psycho-children doing as they wish, with no one acting as an adult - Ronnie, presumably, solely a baby-breeder, and Roy the uncontrolled sperm - who doesn't want the script have these wretched people taken away by aliens - forever.  (Did Terri Garr ever get to portray a woman anyone could stand being around).

Top world-scientists surrounded by computers, and slide rules,  have to rip a large globe from its pedestal in order fix latitude and longitude?  Now, there's a piece of needless and embarrassing  action.

I like the concept of the film.  I like that it is mathematics, including music, that creates a universal language..  It is reasonable that, as portrayed, the government would do everything in its power to deny the arrival of extra-terrestrials, not because I believe they exist, but because governments are historically fearful of a knowledgeable public.

Even on the VHS tape of this movie, there is an interview following the movie.  Just why would there not have been air conditioning brought in to the hangar in Alabama, so that the crew and actors were not sweltering.  What was the point?  I mean, they went to India.  This is why I can't even be an extra.  I'm working.  I get fed.  I don't get exposed to conditions that could land me in the hospital.  This is all very sado-masochistic.  Very unnecessary.

Seeing Devil's Tower in real life, without a script, or special effects, has far more impact than any movie.",1517443200,,1548,4.880769230769231

9421,5,076780192X,"I fell in love with Close Encounters Of The Third Kind when it was playing in theaters. I got this digitally from Amazon in 2008 when streaming video was still a novel and new thing. I didn't care that it was standard def. It's about the story and characters. From a close encounter to a pile of mashed potato or (gasp) a mother in search of her missing child taken by aliens many are drawn to Devils Tower National Monument for their even closer encounter.

I don't want to say too much about the plot because it so much fun to watch it unfold. The story holds up great over the decades. It has lots of intentional humor and some little funny things like the license plate on the car changing when it gets to a new state... It may seem a little strange that there are no cell phones - but back then they didn't exist! It's a Spielberg classic and in its own way as timeless as the original Star Wars.

The quality of the video i got in 2008 is only SD. It's available in HD now and looks a lot better. BUT remember this is from the 70's and technology in film, audio and special effects were nothing like today. It should be watched with allowances for when it was made.

I think it's a great story.and well worth watching for the first time today with allowances for the state of the art in movie making at the time is was made. Give it a watch. It's could open your imagination. it did mine. Clearly I feel it's worthy of 5 stars.",1510617600,,1433,4.184782608695652
9422,3,076780192X,"When I was younger this movie was amazing. The effects were mind blowing. They simply don't hold up. Sitting through this again I realized that almost nothing actually happens and the spectacle of space ships and aliens doesn't really drive much action or story, basically only some conflict with the wife.

9434,5,076780192X,"The basic story is of a telephone line repairman (Richard Dreyfuss) who encounters a UFO and has trouble relating this to his wife (Teri Garr); she is in denial and refuses to entertain the thought that there may be UFOs. There are parallel stories of other people encountering UFO's. Eventually the government is also contacted by the UFOs and sets up a meeting with them had a unique location. The individuals encountered have also been compelled to attend; this to the government's consternation. Will the other invitees make it to the rendezvous point? What trials and tribulations must they endure on the way?

 The lighter version, ""The Collector's Edition"" (ASIN: 0767827031) of the film. This is closer to the original cut but still not the one shown on TV. I bought this version after I realized I had the darker version. Amazon.com did the research for me

The dark version, also called ""The Collector's Edition"" However I think it was supposed to be a director's cut (ASIN: 0800198395) cut out all the comic scenes like the throwing all the dirt in the window prior to building the replica of Devils Mountain. And added some ""Mother gets disturbed scenes."" I bought the dark version first because I thought it had the special ending where the inside of the ship is shown. But I did not know that it was completely remade. Some of the Gas mask scenes are missing also.

If this review ends up on another version you will have to check for your self how complete it really is and what has been cut out.

Other than that if you did not see the original or the third version that is shown periodically on TV you would like this movie and it is worth the purchase price.
-----------------------------------------------
Well now I do not want to mix media with a review that is for the movie however a later contribution with the advent of Blu-ray is the two DVD ""30th Anniversary Ultimate"" editions which seems to have picked up some original material missing from all the tapes. Again I am not trying to distract from the movie content but this edition show that (probably due to this being a movie from the pre-blu-ray era) some scenes are clear and almost three dimensional while others are very grainy and of poor focus.

The sense of tension that is built as all these mysterious things keep happening leads to such a satisfying climax at the end of the move. The score by John Williams is likewise one of the greatest of the last 50 years, and the final piece that leads to the credits is so moving that it gives me chills even after years of repeated viewings.

The cast performances are spectacular all around, from the leads (Richard Dreyfus and Melinda Dillon) to the supporting characters (especially Bob Balaban and Teri Garr), there is not a weak link. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie.",1497398400,2,655,4.504201680672269

9452,3,076780192X,"CE3K is nice to have on Blu-Ray, whether it's the ""essentials"" or ""anniversary"" edition, but you should also keep your DVD handy. The Blu-Ray puts all three versions of the film on one disc, using ""seamless branching"" to automatically edit together whichever cut you choose. But the seamless branching isn't so seamless. The transitions are very obvious, with glitches in the audio. This is especially evident during the model-making scene in Roy's living room while his TV is on. The Blu-Ray picture is of course beautifully sharp, so it is worth having. I just recommend keeping your DVD edition too, so you can choose which is more important whenever you decide watch the film - a sharp picture, or smooth audio transitions.

I wouldn't watch it twice since only the plot was interesting to me and the story line is good but not something that will make you amazed. I would only recommend it to people interested in the whole debate about Aliens etc..I skipped through a lot of parts that were stretched out and didn't show anything really. The idea was simple and I just wanted to know what will happen in the end and what the encounter was like. Everything else was kind of dull.

9481,5,076780192X,"Well, I have liked this movie since it came out in the theater way back in the late '70s. I never owned it on DVD or Bluray until a few days ago. I was at my local used DVD/Bookstore and began browsing the hundreds of DVD titles for cheap. Less than $10 section. To my amazement, there it was, the 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition, complete, for a whopping $7.00. I could not pass this up. It is in near mint condition! I am very happy to own this title now. With this set, I went out and got the ""Essentials"" Blu-ray Edition that has only the 3 movies on Blu-ray (says Disc 1) on bottom.
Now, I have the Ultimate set and I didn't have to pay the ""Ultimate Price"" either!
I love the movie, but the aliens used in the picture are just not that believable. Since there was no CGI back in the day, it was okay.
Now, seeing the likes of THE ABYSS, T2, Jurassic Park movie technology and what can be accomplished with creatures, I think the movie can use a ""touch up"" with the creature effects only. The ships are wonderful.

*** The Special Features for the set here are spread out on the 3 separate DVDs and each ""Version"" of the movie gets it's own DVD. Decent for this format. The ""Making Of"" Documentary is part 1 on DISC ONE, part 2 on DISC TWO, part 3 on DISC THREE with a few more special features on the 3rd DISC to round out the remainder of them.
The packaging is pretty nice and colorful with a nice foldout poster and great colorful picture book inside as well. I have taken a picture of my set to add to this review. Enjoy this movie for what it is, pure Sci-Fi fantasy greatness! The sound is awesome on the set as well and even more enhanced for the Blu-ray editions.",1484006400,3,1679,4.182098765432099

9493,2,076780192X,"Watched this after watching Contact for the first time, and there is no contest about which one is better. The positive reviews for this movie mention ""a sense of wonder an awe"" a lot, Ebert included, and I just don't see it. The main character is an awful person that I didn't want to root for BEFORE he starting losing his mind, let alone after. The pacing is dreadful and the motivations of the characters and the government is poorly sketched, so it's just hard to care about what's happening on screen. Possibly worse, they kept trying to add suspense with mysteries and spooky happenings that the movie had already let the audience in on 10 minutes ago.

The only redeeming factor was some good thematic moviemaking. People struggling to communicate and have relationships with each other, giving a dim view of the almost impossible communication with another species. It's a shame those themes don't get resolved in the script and that the main character doesn't appear to change himself or the plot by the finale.

Oh, and aliens come to abduct people including a fearless boy named Barry......and the aliens act more like Poltergeists then actual aliens who only show up at the end to play a glorified game of Simon the memory electronic toy.  You don't get a good look at the aliens at all and somehow a few certain people just know to go to Devil's Tower to meet the aliens.

Yeah, yeah.  This movie is a masterpiece and all.  I AM giving it five stars but as with all reviewers I'm pointing out the flaws in this: the people just know to go to Devil's Tower....they make pictures and a really big sculpture of it and yet they don't know why they're doing it. ...or know just what it is until they see the Tower on the news.

People who were reported missing come back with the aliens and people go with the aliens when they leave.....all but Barry because the aliens found him too annoying I guess.

  I have always been impressed with the actors and actresses who gave life to the characters in the movie. The one that has always impressed me is the character ""Barry"" (played fantastically by Cary Guffey!); that, and the way writer/director Steven Spielberg was able to get the responses needed from Cary. I know, from reading on the web, that Mr. Guffey doesn't want to be remembered only for his role in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""; this, I can understand. I have to say, though, that he did a hell of a job!
  The story itself, is interesting and inspiring; the music enchanting and moving, and the locations were impressive. And, now, I can enjoy it whenever I choose!

9650,5,076780192X,"Excellent release of one of the classics of modern American cinema--one that truly deserves its crown. Plenty of extras make this a DVD set that people will return to over and over again for entertainment.

The movie's quite simple: after a very strange encounter with bright flying lights one evening, everyman Roy Neary starts experiencing compulsions and visions related to a particular mountain and a particular strain of music. Apparently people all over the world are also having similar encounters and subsequent visions. The visions draw Roy and his compatriots to a Wyoming mountain, where all signs point to an impending world-shaking encounter with aliens. Meanwhile, the American government is also aware of the impending meeting; its agents are doing everything they can to secure the area. Roy must evade these agents to reach the mountain so he can respond to the celestial invitation he's been given. It's a slow burn of a movie, more about how someone normal responds to an extraordinary situation than about the actual mechanics of aliens and spaceships. It doesn't whizbang with car chases and shootouts, but that's a big part of its charm (when a group of government scientists break into an office in one scene to steal a large globe, I cheer every time that thing thumps into the hallway as they roll it away--it's such a human moment; yes, they don't really need the globe, but it's so exciting to see anyway). And when someone considers the year in which this movie was made, its special effects become all the more impressive. I find these older movies very charming because their special effects had to be made by hand.

The box set includes not only the different versions of the movie from the theatrical release to the 1980 Special Edition and also a more recent Collector's Edition that includes a bunch of once-deleted scenes and what I think is a much smoother ending. We also get a bunch of interviews, documentaries, and associated standard DVD extras like deleted scenes. The sound and visual quality is superb and quite beautifully mastered, with even dark scenes crisp and easy to see. The creators of this edition really worked hard to take full advantage of modern technology. Even if someone has one of the previous Close Encounters DVD, this might be a really good upgrade to consider for its extras and incredible mastering. And if one has not ever seen this classic, what better time to jump in?",1443312000,,2438,4.900726392251816

In 1977 these special effects with all the electronics activating themselves and the giant spaceship coming down must of been earth shattering but viewed now it is a slow, disjointed mess. I know the guy playing the Frenchman is a legendary director but having the character be French means nothing, and is especially confusing to follow. Why is a French UFO hunter investigating missing American WWII planes? What?!? It goes on from the as we transition from one drawn out scene to the next. The characters are all flat, Dreyfuss is underwhelming and after his encounter, he has visions which cause his wife and family to split. I never cared about any of the characters, they were one dimensional and stereotypical. It just goes on too long. This is a slow plodding film with no rhyme or reason that just doesn't hold up. Save yourself 2 and 1/2 hours and skip this. After Jaws, Spielberg was the it boy and they gave him carte blanche and he gave them an alien encounter movie. He did much better with E.T. but this one not so much.",1437177600,8,1056,4.592592592592593

9730,5,076780192X,"One of my 5 favorite films of all time, I gave up my 3-disc DVD boxed set to get this concise version. I'm not disappointed. Disc 1 has all 3 versions, and Disc 2 has all the same extras as the 30th Anniv version.

Roy Neary's going into the ship in the '80 version was a studio decision that Spielberg was dead-set against, but his clout in Hollywood wasn't as strong back then. The studio executives thought it's what the audience wanted. His ""Director's Cut"" is the REAL Spielberg version. I must agree; the extra effects in the '80 version diminished the awe of Neary's adventure, a sort of anti-climax.

It's truly an awesome film achievement, nominated for 8 Oscars, but not Best Picture. I have no end of admiration for Spielberg's film, in any of its incarnations. Dreyfuss won the Best Actor Oscar, deservedly, for ""The Goodbye Girl"" in '77, but I'm sure the strength of his performance in ""Close Encounters"" was considered.  A class act, and a courageous performance, in both cases.

I love this film, on so many levels. Music IS the universal language.",1427760000,,1063,4.668449197860962

9764,5,076780192X,"Missing - American Fighter Planes from World War II (1941-1945) are found intact, 50 years after they seemingly disappeared off of the radar. A long lost, stranded ship was suddenly found, in of all places... the middle of the desert. But, where are the U.S. Fighter Pilots and the ships', crew members? A shrouded mystery or a forth coming revelation? And why, only now..., are people from all over the globe starting to witness bright lights and unidentified flying objects also known as U.F.O.'s, soaring across the peaceful, night skies? And why, are the witnesses of this cosmic phenomenon being sun-burned from the rays of light that the U.F.O.'s emit? In addition too, having a sudden compulsion that ever-increasingly becomes an obsession to visit the ""Devil's Tower"" located in the State of Wyoming? And again why are they all playing or humming the same musical notes, that is innately foreign to them? Just what exactly is happening to them? And more importantly, what did the sighting of these U.F.O.'s do to them, so that their previously ""normal"" behavior is now erratic, compulsive and even  obsessive? What is the secret of Devil's Tower in conjunction with the U.F.O. witnesses that are driven to get there, come what may? While thousands of others, who live around the Devil's Tower/Wyoming area, are being systematically evacuated from the surrounding region by the United States Government, no less? What's happening? Could it be that the American Government and officials from foreign countries are conducting celestial experiments and communicating with martians and other space aliens? If so, why wasn't the public told? And if the U.S. and combined allied governments are not exploring space communications, are we being invaded, unknowingly? And why are the witnesses of these U.F.O. sightings... world over, being patronized and talked too... as if they all, at the same time, have suddenly gone crazy? What is going on?! And what is a CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND, anyway? Within this enormously popular, 1977, color, extraterrestrial, Box Office-smash hit, film: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND - the 30th, 2-disc, DVD set, Anniversary Edition which was remastered in High Definition with Dolby 5.1 Sound, mesmerizes and visually stuns the viewing audience with brilliant special effects, story and content. This amazing, science-fiction blockbuster which was directed by the Academy Award-winning Director - Steven Spielberg, dramatically astounds and comically amuses it's audience with it's ultra-creative, big-screen, special effects and overall wonderful story and superb contents. This Columbia Pictures/EMI presentation of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND - 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION is nothing short of spectacular! This controversial yet fascinating topic about U.F.O.'s and the people that witness their sighting, is as intriguing as it is, engaging. Are we alone? According to this awesome movie extravaganza, apparently not. This incredibly popular motion picture was so well done, that it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards and rightly, so! Because this is not just another excellent film, it is truly, a motion picture event! Steven Spielberg clearly shows his creative genius as both, a Screenplay Writer and Director of this riveting film. So, that brings us to the obvious question: What exactly is a CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND? Good question. The FIRST ENCOUNTER - is the witnessing of an actual unidentified flying object (U.F.O.), flying through the sky. The SECOND ENCOUNTER - is the discovery of physical evidence which validates that there was an actual appearance of an unidentified flying object (U.F.O.). And the THIRD ENCOUNTER - is the actual contact with the U.F.O. and/or it's alien inhabitants. And this film also brilliantly illustrates as well as educates, the viewing public - with dramatic flair and pockets of cosmic relief, about all three forms of U.F.O. encounters. And because this awesome motion picture deals with a very unique topic and the subsequent emotions and personal drama that is associated with but kept under wraps when experiencing and dealing with U.F.O. sightings. Or what one 'thinks' is an unidentified flying object and the rejection and disbelief that one faces from the scoffers and the nay-sayer's, resounds world over with the viewing audience. Why? Because people usually think that a person who says that they have seen a U.F.O., have just had a bad session with their psychiatrist and are hallucinating or that their medication needs to be adjusted. Others, are thought to have 'popped one too many' illegal pills and are ""tripping!"" Or that they have '...fallen of of the wagon...' and are back on the bottle. Either that, or they have smoked and inhaled a little to much of their marijuana or hashish - joint/reefer cigarette, and are now... flying high, together with their imaginary, little green men and Martian brethren. Or lastly, that they are just plain losing their mind. Sounds reasonable, right?! Because after all, there is no such thing as a U.F.O., right?! Not according to Roy Neary - played by Actor Richard Dreyfuss, who had a 'sighting' and then some, while driving to work in his cable truck, one night. A happily married, husband and father who up to that point, had no mental or emotional ""instabilities"" and was thought to be ""normal"", had absolutely nothing better to do other than ruin his marriage and relationship with his children by coming home in the middle of the night, claiming that he saw an unidentified flying object. It completely changed his life and led him and all others that saw the U.F.O.'s, on a celestial quest of discovery which culminated at a mountain-like structure, named: Devil's Tower. This superb film which brilliantly depicts an epic odyssey of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, is a colossal, big-screen, achievement. Produced by Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips with music by John Williams, it stars: Actors Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary; Actress Teri Garr as his wife  Ronnie Neary; Francois Truffant as Claude Lacombe and Melinda Dillon as Julian Guiler. It comes in spoken English with subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And, as if that weren't enough, this electrifying motion picture comes with a Steven Spielberg cast and crew, interview; deleted scenes; theatrical trailers and the making of a documentary and behind the behind the scenes footage of this incredible, one-of-a-kind, epic production. This is one entertaining movie which will take you out of your comfort zone with it's dazzling creativity and wondrous amazement, in search of the cosmic unknown. So, get your popcorn ready, get good and comfy and ENJOY! Because in every sense, this is an awesome film and a true sight and thrill to behold! And a definite keeper for your 'must have' DVD collection! Nina Kish",1416614400,2,6861,5.196928635953026

A UFO flies above dryfuss truck and all you get is shaking mail boxes and a strobe light display. UFO's should have much better fire works then this. Like seeing a magic act only with cards. No one disappears or gets cut in half or flies above your head. These was aliens from a galaxy far far away, ask goerge Lucas how far; but anyhow, we should have seen better fire works in this movie.

Very pretty steelbook. My only complaint is that, after the special edition in 1980, ALL the artwork seems to have no problem with GIVING AWAY THE ENDING ON THE COVER! Geez, spoiler much?
The great plus is that it has seamless branching of all THREE versions of the film: Theatrical (which I saw in '77 and prefer), Special Edition (the '80 inside the spaceship ending), and Director's Cut (which is a mix of different elements).
The versions differ in content beyond just the ending. See what you like.

I could go on but I'll say Steven Spielburg, the director and writer knows how to make you feel like you care about the main characters and how to  enjoy a happy ending.

9820,5,076780192X,"This film (probably errantly) reminded me of the film Field of Dreams, in which, instead of extraterrestrial visitation, a middle aged guy starts seeing ghosts. So many of these movies are said to be meant as a metaphor (I suppose if one has a cause one wants to champion). What about Close Encounters of the Third Kind? What is the hidden meaning or relevancy, if there is one?

My cause, I suppose, is men's rights. I'm sympathetic towards the men's movement. When I watched, really listened (playing in the next room) the film Rain Man, I couldn't help wonder if the film makers were intentionally contrasting the two main characters in the film, Tom Cruise, a harried self-employed man, and Dustin Hoffman his brother who is stricken by Autism. Dozens of years ago (now long forgotten from memory) psychologists felt Autism was caused by some kind of environmental problem or parental neglect. But the existence of such an idea could potentially be offensive toward women and mothers somehow? In the film Rain Man itself, the film may be suggesting the child with Autism is the luckier or happier of the two.

Watching Spielberg's film Jaws (which I may soon review), the police chief makes it, the college guy makes it, but the working class guy just can't escape the shark. There's a scene, when their ship first sets out on the water, I believe, where you can see a reflection of the American flag showing on the water.

When watching the paranoid SF film 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', and it's sequel, the films are warning us, ironically, of mind control emanating from Hollywood? Planet of the Apes is warning us not just of mental degradation, a society where the humans don't speak, but also a kind of racial replacement? Enough is enough already with these old films?

Thinking about Closer Encounters (after only first watching the whole movie on TV 5 or so years ago), I had to wonder, myself, if this film was focusing on Richard Dreyfuss's mental illness. I remembered the scene of him throwing shrubs out the window. Are masses of American men in such dire straights? What about real people, apparently, who honestly believe they have been visited by UFO's? Is this film exploring mental illness, or is it meant to bring to life the thoughts of someone who genuinely believes they've been visited by aliens? Could there be a more noble cause than giving voice to such a voiceless and likely powerless person?

The film Close Encounters of the Third Kind for the most part takes it's subject literally and doesn't seem to be a metaphor for something else. It's a good film that makes you think about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. There's a great line in the movie where Richard Dreyfuss, while speaking to a government official, tells the official, ""You can't fool us, by agreeing with us"". Close Encounters shows government officials dealing with the public in a secretive and less than open and upfront way. Shouldn't government just be more open and honest, and about the people? Of the people, and not the elites?

(in case you missed it, I'm suggesting this film helped get Ronald Reagan elected president, or at least smooth that transition or process).

When watching Close Encounters again, I knew what to expect. There were the 'astronauts', young people from all over the globe, dressed in their suits and apparently, waiting to board the alien ships. And the small aliens leave their ship, seemingly to be exchanged with them and ready to spend some time on Earth. I'd read stories of explorers and natives making exchanges like this, for the purpose of language acquisition, this scene reminded me of these stories. When the alien ship leaves, however, at the end of the film, no one but Richard Dreyfuss gets on the ship? Is it just me, or at the end, does the film show Richard Dreyfuss and no one else, getting on the alien ship before it leaves? The aliens sure went to a lot of trouble to pick up one guy from Indiana. I watched the ending again (although I haven't see all three versions), and it's true, no one but Richard Dreyfuss gets on the alien ship.",1402617600,,4107,4.751753155680224

9831,5,076780192X,"I will not go into detail on how I feel about Steven Spielberg's wonderful science-fiction odyssey, probably one of the best movies ever made and a classic in the science-fiction genre, despite what the knucklehead academics say. Instead, I will address the minor controversy surrounding the Blu-Ray editions of the movie.

As everyone knows, there are two types of Blu-Ray editions of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". One is the 30th anniversary box set, which includes the three versions of the movie (Theatrical, Special Edition and Director's Cut) on one disc; a plethora of bonus features on the second; and a booklet (the 3-disc DVD version of the set contains one version on one disc each, a making-of documentary scattered on all the discs, and the rest of the bonus features on the director's cut disc). The other is the cheaper, newly released ""Blu-Ray Essentials"" version, which only contains the first disc of all the three versions but no booklet and zero bonus features (except for the Blu-Ray exclusive ""A View from Above"" feature, whose main purpose is to show viewers the difference between all three versions).

The reason I'm addressing this is because some Amazon.com reviewers (including myself) have expressed dismay over buying the wrong edition. Unlike these reviewers, I am not entirely angered by this since I already have the 30th anniversary edition on DVD and that I bought the ""Essentials"" version just to upgrade to Blu-Ray (it also helped that it was on sale for a meager $7). But I can understand the frustrations looming in the reviews section and I wish Amazon would have notified this and state the differences.

If you're going to upgrade to Blu-Ray and want to learn the history behind ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", it's highly recommended you buy the 30th Anniversary box set. However, if you just want to buy ""Close Encounters"" primarily for the picture and audio quality and have no care for the extras, the ""Blu-Ray Essentials"" version will serve you well. It also helps that it's much cheaper than the other set (at least, at this moment).

Either way, this movie is a dazzler on Blu-Ray. Columbia did a phenomenal job restoring ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" in its best condition. The picture quality is superb and the audio is dazzling, particularly on the surround sound speakers. Some reviewers complained about the existence of grain, but this movie was shot on celluloid, not digital photography, so, of course, the grain is inevitable. Even so, it shouldn't distract from the incredible experience you'll have while watching this terrific movie on Blu-Ray and with a big screen TV. When the alien mothership lands on the Devil's Tower in the movie's climax, you'll feel the experience like no other in the previous VHS and DVD versions.

""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" belongs in every movie collection and now thanks to Blu-Ray, it looks and sounds better than ever. If you are hesitant to replace your DVD player with a Blu-Ray player, then this version of this film should force your hand.

Strongest recommendation.",1396569600,56,3095,4.97678916827853
9832,5,076780192X,"This release of one of Mr. Spielberg's classic films was the first Blu Ray to use seamless branching to include all three cuts of the film on the first disc.

If you have a good quality set up, i.e a full surround sound 5.1(or 7.1) set up you will be in heaven. The amount of LFE when the ships appear and especially the final scene with the mother ship is amazing. All the dialog is crisp and clear and the fantastic John Williams score is even better in lossless audio.

It is not, of course, a perfect film, earlier scenes are somewhat too broad in portrayal of the impact on Dreyfuss' imagination as to what such a 'close encounter' might actually entail. Richard Dreyfuss gets solo billing in the brief introductory credits at the beginning of the movie: quite an actor's coup but recognition of the weight put on his performance in sustaining most of the film.

9878,5,076780192X,"Between autumn 1975, after Jaws had become such a, excuse the pun, monster hit the previous summer, and November 1977, when Close Encounters finally opened, it held the distinction of being the most eagerly awaited movie since Gone with the Wind. Alas, it didn't turn out to be the attraction for the ages that so many people, myself included, had hoped. That said, it does deliver a terrific amount of entertainment value.

The title refers to a phrase invented by science author J. Allan Hynek (who shows up in a cameo role) to describe three potential interactions between humans and alien life forms. The first involves a sighting, the second produces physical evidence, and the third results in some sort of contact.

In this story, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an Indiana electric utility company worker and family man, experiences a close encounter of the first kind one night while investigating a power outage. He sees something extraordinary that scares the wits out of him and also leaves him with an encounter of the second kind (a partial sunburn) and disturbs him so severely that it eventually estranges his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) and his children. But the episode also endears him to Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a similarly tormented, single mother whose son (played amazingly well by four-year-old Cary Guffey) has been kidnapped, presumably by the aliens. While Neary tries desperately to figure out what is going on, in another part of the country a secret team led by French scientist Claude Lacombe (the great movie director Francois Truffaut) is investigating the recent strange occurrences, and the efforts eventually draw everyone involved to a climactic meeting at a most distinctive geographic landmark. Spielberg orchestrated that climax with so much visceral power that I once saw a fellow moviegoer weeping uncontrollably after the house lights came back up.

The movie's emotional punch even caused Stanley Kaufman, the august movie critic of The New Republic, to call Close Encounters not so much a movie as ""an event in the history of faith."" In more proper perspective, Gary Arnold concluded his review in The Washington Post by saying that if real aliens ever landed and they didn't resemble Spielberg's vision, ""they obviously aren't movie lovers, have no romance in their souls, and to hell with `em."" However you end up reacting, you'll probably agree that Close Encounters demonstrated how Spielberg was destined to become a giant of American cinema.

In an interview with Film Comment magazine, Spielberg once summed up his abilities by saying, ""I sort of know what works."" It's true. What's also true is Close Encounters works despite making very little sense - if start asking obvious questions the whole story begins to fall apart. No matter. Spielberg communicates subliminally to moviegoers so effectively that they willingly buy on, whatever the logical shortcomings. Along with the director's considerable skills at cinematic storytelling, the movie boasts dazzling and groundbreaking visual effects by Douglas Trumbull; gorgeous, Oscar-winning cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, and possibly the best work that composer John Williams has ever done. It's an absolute crowd-pleaser.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1382313600,,3485,5.619771863117871
9879,3,076780192X,"I love Spielberg AND John Williams. Plus Richard Dreyfuss was great. But, I got bored in this movie. I was too young to watch it when it first came out. Then, once I was old enough, I forgot about it. So, my husband and I watched it with our kids just recently.

Maybe I was just tired that night, but I got kinda bored. It isn't that I felt that the special effects were dated and no longer amazing. Not at all. I just didn't feel the ""tension"" that I would expect from such an iconic film. I started losing interest right when I should've been on the edge of my seat. When Roy and Jillian (Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon) were climbing up to Devil's tower with the other guy... they were evading the miliary/goverment... I just wasn't feeling too worried about them for some reason. And everything that happened after that seemed pretty flat which is crazy b/c a big mother ship with a bunch of aliens showed up.

On a positive note, the soundtrack is great. The acting is great. The set design was so accurate. I remember thinking the same thing when I recently watched ET with my kids. ""That really looks like a house where kids live."" Things are just the right kind of cluttery mess.

Nothing is overstated or overdone. The characters all feel very authentic. Also, the government scare tactic to keep the people away from Devil's tower is done really well. It wasn't some evil, nefarious government plot to screw the people. This could've easily been overdone but wasn't.

Overall, it is one of those movies you should watch, I guess. But, you might not get a big ""WOW"" at the end.",1382140800,4,1584,4.470588235294118

9881,5,076780192X,"the biblical symbols in this film are very striking.  The clouds moving across the evening sky, the lights within the clouds.  Remind the watcher of biblical appearances by god.  The intense desire on the part of the characters to go to the source of these events, also points to biblical situations.  The special effects are dazzling in my opinion, although I don't believe these events could have been kept secret for very long, in view of the number of people involved in them.  The lighter scenes are quite humorous, especially the mash potatoes.  This film in my opinion, was designed to make the viewer feel closer to his creator, and to dispell the idea that we are totally alone in the universe.  A very good film, well worth purchasing.

9902,5,076780192X,"This review is based upon the single disc, Blu Ray of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  Others have so fully summarized the movie and provided their opinions upon the acting performances, et al, I will refrain from doing so and just focus upon the quality of the  transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray which is what I do with all my reviews.

With this disc you get 3 different versions of the film, you get the theatrical release, a special version and the Directors cut.  I chose the Director's Cut as if it is what Spielberg envisioned and not the studios, then that I what I want to see. The theatrical version clocks in at 135 minutes, while the Special Edition clocks in at 132 minutes and the Director's Cut at 137minutes.  The Audio for all 3 versions is DTS MA 5.1 lossless audio for English and French, while the Spanish viewer gets lossless Dolby True HD 5.1.  Since both lossless codecs are very good and significantly better than any lossy audio codec, I do not believe that anyone could tell the difference, but more on the audio later on.

VIIDEO....The cover of the Blu Ray says that the film has been remastered and I believe it.  While I had not seen the film in many years and do not own the Standard Def DVD and, thus, have nothing to compare it with, all I can say is that the video transfer looks beautiful in all ways.  The colors are just gorgeous with the daylight sky shots a rich and smooth blue.  The blacks are as true to black as I have seen in the past with great details easily showing in these dark and shadowy areas.  At no point in watching the Director's Cut did I see any artifacting nor stair-stepping which would have been prominent is many of the wide angle landscape shots.  The video transfer absolutely deserves the 5 stars I gave it.

AUDIO...Watched in the lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 and the balance of audio levels between the dialogue and John Williams music score was exceptionally good.  The music score is spread quite nicely across the front stage with stereo imaging of the instruments nicely placed.  During the first  half of the movie I was a touch disappointed that the rear channels were not used that often for front to rear pans or foley FX.  However, the second half of the film wakes things up with several uses for the rear channels and discreet channeling of the audio fx to both left and right.  It is here where your LFE sub channel will come alive and if you have a good sub and it is set properly, it will certainly get a musical workout.  I rate the overall  audio with 4 stars.

EXTRAS...While I have read that there were several extras on other releases of this film,  this particular release had no 'making of' documentaries or commentaries.  The only extra, which I did not use or try, is a special pop up called 'In Movie A View from Above (Editor's Fact Ttrack'.  This feature pops up an icon, depending upon which version of the film you are watching that provides a fact or two about why a specific scene was cut or added back in as well as other trivia I suppose.  At least there were no previews for other movies taking up room on the Blu Ray.  I hate to pay for advertising and an even greater compression of the feature film than it needs to be.

All in all, this is a classic film with brilliant work by Richard Dreyfus, a superior actor, and a great transfer on Blu Ray.  I would encourage you to purchase it.
I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase or not.

9906,3,076780192X,"Everyone alive has seen this movie by now, so there's no point in writing yet another review.  I just wanted to say something negative about Richard Dreyfus, who in my opinion is possibly one of the worst actors - ever.  And I mean that.  He's untalented, irritating and just terrible in every role.  I can't think of one role he's done where that whiny, abrasive, neurotic personality doesn't diminish the movie.  And I can't think of any movie he's been in that virtually ANY other actor could not have done better.  That includes Close Encounters, the Goodbye Girl, What About Bob, etc.  Honestly, I try to avoid his films at all costs - but a couple of these had good stories and other good actors.  This movie is one of those.  So I was compelled to watch it.  But it makes you wish at several points in the movie that they would have just killed off his character and gone in a different direction.  It was a mistake to try and build a great movie around him, and obviously, I'm still unhappy that they tried.  I don't know who's life he saved, or who he loaned money to - but somebody clearly was forced to put him in.  He, by himself, brought this movie down two full stars.  Still a good one, but it could have been really superb without him.  Well, there it is.  Richard, I hope you run across this review someday and understand how much I really despise the fact that you ""made it"" to the big screen when so many other deserving, talented actors did not.

They added a very minuscule scene of the spaceship interior. I could have done without it or they could have made it more interesting. I rarely agree that it is better to leave endings or spaceship interiors to the imaginations of the viewers, although I'm not saying every movie always needs either. I just don't sit around long after the movies elaborately imagining what I might see or what an outcome is or sit and draw up my own story, it's their story and ideas.

9955,5,076780192X,"are on blu-ray, in the 2-disc set, all are excellent, for different reasons, and all are part of cinematic history.

I like Spielberg's third Director's Cut the best, except that it excludes Roy at the power station in the beginning which was shown in the 1977 original theatrical release version.  This scene was important, to show why Roy chooses not to show up for that job anymore after his initial UFO sighting (the job was thankless and his bosses were real A-holes).

Flip-flopped in the Special Edition and Director's Cut are the night sighting picnic with the India ""Where did these sounds come from?"" segments, which, I think, flow better in the order they were presented in the 1977 version.  The cut between the night sighting picnic that turns out to be noisy helicopters and the subsequent dead-quiet of the observation station is more jarring in the latter two versions than in the 1977 version, where the noisy helicopter's search light on Roy cuts to the cars arriving in India in sunlight.  But, in the grand scheme, of the timeline of chronologically telling the story, one can see why Spielberg flip-flopped the order of these two scenes.

The ""pillow mountain bit"" is happily removed from the latter two versions; never much cared for that.

Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed of Rocky fame) does a brief cameo in the 1977 version as an Army seargant who interrogates suspicious-looking Roy, who looks like a potential looter, during the evacuation sequence, when the bird salesman is doing a great scare job in the background.  This bit, quirky but not really necessary, is happily removed from the latter two versions, and instead the scene hangs on the bird salesman saying ""Even my dog has a gas mask!  And any of you folks are worth more than a dog!""  Funny.

The Roy in the bathtub fully-clothed sequence, which ends in a horrible screaming match that involves the whole Neary family, followed by the Roy yanking out the neighbor's chicken wire and throwing bricks and dirt into his kitchen window to build his ultimate Devil's Tower model next day, perfectly segues into Roy's wife, Ronnie, taking the kids and leaving for her sister's, for good, in the Director's Cut.  In the 1977 cut, we don't know what the heck Ronnie is talking about when she says to Roy, in the morning, ""I'm sorry about last night"", and, in the 1980 Special Edition cut, the entire Roy throwing dirt into the house scene is excised, cutting from Roy realizing that Devil's Tower has a cut-off peak, to Ronnie taking the kids, which also doesn't make sense.  I'm glad Spielberg finally got it right by including BOTH scenes in his Director's Cut.

This is one of the most AWESOME achievements in cinematic history, a triumph of human imagination, and a film that has a truly noble, altruistic agenda, in an era of otherwise formulaic ""beastie"" monster movies.  It gets the awesome transfer, in all 3 versions, that it deserves.  Spielberg's critics said ""lightning can't strike twice"" after the wunderkind young director struck a massive bolt with his last stroke of genius, Jaws.  They were wrong!

This set has excellent behind-the-scenes extras, including the classic 1977 Watch the Skies featurette that was shown in cinemas (finally transferred here in HD!), a complete 1997 retrospective produced by Laurent Bouzereau, and some new interviews with Spielberg, also produced and directed by Bouzerau, that shed new ""light"" on the whole project.

This film set the tone for much of what happened at the movies for roughly the next 15-20 years following its 1977 theatrical release. Close Encounters is essentially a near perfect product defining the time it came out.  The film explores alien visitors, government conspiracies, general paranoia, sensationalism. family issues, and ultimately madness.  The depth these issues are explored make this film a hallmark of American cinema. It is the movie version of imagination and wonder. This is a philosophy and vision regarding what an alien visit to the planet would look like.  There is no war and nothing is getting blown up. The main thing happening is communication. It is amazing. It is done in a such a thoughtful way that it stands effectively as an excellent contribution to the collective consciousness imagination about such matters as alien visits. After repeat viewings the most important question is: What do you believe? This is a human film that defines the medium of movie making.

9961,4,076780192X,"When it first made its theatrical run, I thought Spielberg's offering of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was campy weak sauce.  (After all, I was into the 'Star Wars' craze of the time.)  I mean, come on:  Richard Dreyfuss sculpting on a heap of mashed potatoes in a (futile) attempt to recreate the image of Devil's Tower; earthlings communicating with a highly advanced civilization via. . .muscial notes.  My eye muscles were sore due to the constant rolling of them.  I was (and is) a huge fan of Spielberg's 'Jaws'; with this sci-fi pseudo epic, I had thought the young director badly missed the mark.  There weren't even any Jedi lightsabers, for cryin' out loud.

Now that I'm older (and hopefully wiser) I've come to respect and admire nuance and substance.  Having recently caught this 1977 feature film again (thank you, cable), I was, simply, impressed.  Very impressed.  This story of a sudden onslaught of UFO sightings, and subsequent 'close encounters' of a select few (who then became obsessed wanting to know the answers to unknown questions) is as compelling and believable as it is fascinating and thought-provoking.  Now it makes sense to me how Dreyfuss's character indirectly goes off his rocker and embarks on some really bizarre behaviour.  (The scene depicting him yanking his shrubs out of the ground and hurling them through the windows of his home while his terrified family look on had me in stitches.)  An alien encounter at a rural home where a horrified young mother (Melinda Dillon) watches appliances from her vacuum to her dishwasher come on by themselves--screws from a floor vent magically unscrewing themselves out of the floor--is jarring and indeed frightening.  Spielberg's story then rushes breathlessly to Devil's Tower, Wyoming, where (under the guise of a chemical contamination to empty the local population) swarthy G-men prepare for a very special visitor--and a select few of those who are touched by alien contact enter onstage, too.

And the table is set for the climax; even now, all these years later, I marvel at the special effects.  The image of spacecraft of varying shapes, sizes, and colors is awe-inspiring.  (The munchin-like appearances of the extraterrestrials is kind of lame, but who nitpicks?)  Over the course of this encounter, those who have disappeared over the years come home, and a select few volunteers board the mother ship.  And we witness an exchange of civilizations sans violence and bloodshed--in essence, an exchange that someday may very well happen.  Augmented and enhanced by the core group of Dreyfuss, Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, and Francois Truffaut, Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is a gripping, engrossing tale of otherworldly dimensions.  Beam me aboard.

Because I was so caught up in the Star Wars phenomenon, and also because I thought (being a child, mind you) that the movie story line was a bit lame (and a bit weird with the way Richard Dreyfuss's character was), I didn't particularly care for it.  Where's Luke Skywalker?  Darth Vader?  ""May the force will be with you?""  The Death Star?  The Millenium Falcon?  You get the idea.  Nevertheless, I still remember those 5 notes/tones that define it.  After a time, I pretty much forgot all about the movie.  Until I saw it on T.V. recently.

Generally, everything looks fine.  The Blu-Ray is a definite 90% improvement, but there are scenes that don't really look much better that the original DVD.

This movie has always been hampered by the highly compressed nature of the audio, especially the score.  Unfortunately, what we have here is no improvement.  You would think that with all of the effort that goes into so-called ""ultimate"" versions, they could have gone in to touch-up some of the film's score.  Case in point, is over the end credits.  Compare what you hear with John Williams recording with the Boston Pops which includes the new material from the Special Edition version.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/By-Request-The-Best-Of-John-Williams-And-The-Boston-Pops-Orchestra/dp/B0000040YP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">By Request: The Best Of John Williams And The Boston Pops Orchestra</a>&nbsp;The difference is stunning.  But, alas...

There is one downside (and I admit that this is probably nit-picking) but Criterion's CAV laserdisc version was so wonderful since one could program (edit) the movie into what I (!) felt was the ultimate version.  With all 3 versions on the Blu-Ray, frankly, I do not find one to be completely satisfying.  If we only had the original version, there would be no issue; nothing to compare, too.  But, with 3 versions, one sees things that could have been improved to make (what I think) is a true ultimate version.  But, again, alas...

I love this movie.  The excitement and sense of wonder has always given me goosebumps.  If you have a Blu-Ray, right now, this is the only version to own.",1334966400,4,1683,5.490272373540856

I was not living in North America at the time and saw it while on vacation from Britain. I'd seen no trailers or other publicity, so I came to it with no preconceptions whatever. I found the sense of wonder in the movie and the gradual drawing together of the threads to the climax to be fascinating; and the climax itself, on a giant screen, was awe-inspiring. I've never got quite the same feeling of magic from any other movie. It's 35 years since the movie burst upon the scene and evidence of its influence is still seen in numerous movies (most recently 'Super 8'), but nothing has quite matched the original. It is truly a seminal movie of the genre.

The drawback about seeing it on DVD is that, even with today's large-screen TVs, the movie needs a bigger stage to deliver maximum impact. It's still a wonderful film, one which I continue to enjoy after many, many viewings, but I'm so glad my first experience of it was in the theater, totally unprepared for what I was about to see.",1323388800,,1093,4.465
9975,5,076780192X,"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind was written when director Steven Spielberg was just out of his teens. It was a project very close and personal to him and after the box office success of Jaws (1975), he was able to receive respect and creative freedom in Hollywood and was finally able to make his dream film as his follow up. Released in Novemeber of 1977, Close Encounters may be one of the best examples of Spielberg's great storytelling abilities ans sensibilities. I find this to be one of the most hopeful films I have ever seen. When the film opens, we are presented with an unsettling set up, we feel uncertain and even frightened and by the end of the film, we learn to have faith in our existence.

The story is very simple, a ordinary family man sees a UFO and is planted a message. He then tries to put the pieces together and find what the message means. His wife and kids feel that he is losing his mind as he tries to figure out what his purpose is and why he was chosen. He senses that there is a location that is very important although he doesn't know why, he just knows that it means something. His family eventually leaves him and he is left to find the answer himself. He later discovers that a women he met earlier in the film received the same message and together they try to find the location and discover its purpose. It doesn't come easily though, it's a magical journey that ends with people learning to communicate and return to their inner child. You have to watch the film to understand what I mean.

This movie was very moving in a decade that just didn't have many of those. The 70s were confusing times where we had lost faith in the world. When the film begins, we are scared that something isn't right. You get the sense (or at least I did) that we are lost and there is no communication or trust and at the end of the film we learn to see our world and ourselves through innocence and love. It is clearly a fantasy film but unlike Star Wars, which was released the same year, this film is more of a statement. It's a beautiful film about as I say, childhood innocence. I always walk away from this film with hope that maybe we can change and maybe one day, we will learn to fully understand our own self and eventually, our universe.

One last thing, if you want to view this film, I would recommend the 1998 director's cut which I feel is the best version of this movie.",1319587200,,2410,4.3039647577092515

There is enclosed a nice 30th anniversary booklet with a lot of pics, trivia and retrospective. We don't get commentary, but we do get a Editor's Fast Track that pretty much does the same trick.

If you like science fiction, chances are you've already seen this. If you are a fence sitter, wondering if the BD is worth it, the special features alone scream 'yes!' For once, you can't complain about sound or video thanks to all the alternate settings. So you don't have to suffer a bad transfer. Instead you are left following the wonder of normal folk who experience first contact. Watch them question their lives and become infected with the promise of something more than their banal lives. This is a much more cerebral film than most other 'first contacts'. Here, we are promised something different, a learning experience, a chance of friendship.

It's all too rare to find movies with a positive resolution instead of cheering on a heroic character that might or might not deserve said cheer.

It has the 1977 theatrical version, the 1980 special edition, and the 1998 director's cut! Also, there's some extra features. I first saw Close Encounters when I rented a VHS tape from the video store in 1998. Roy(Richard Dreyfuss) encounters a UFO while stuck at a railroad crossing. He has a vision of a tower in his mind. Director Steven Spielberg succeeded in casting French film director Francois Truffaut as a French scientist. Melinda Dillon plays a single mother and lovely Terri Garr plays Roy's wife. The special effects by Douglas Trumbull, Greg Jein, Ralph McQuarrie, and Dennis Muren are superb. The animatronic extraterrestrials built by Carlo Rambaldi are first rate. John Williams' music score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind is flawless. The five note motif was spoofed by a school band on a TV show and in the 007 film Moonraker(1979). This film has the iconic scene with Roy making a tower with mashed potatoes. This scene was spoofed in UHF(1989) and The Simpsons.
 The 1977 version of Close Encounters shows Terri Garr listening to an officer talking about UFO's. The 1980 version of the film shows the bright, colorful inside of the mothership. Cary Guffey is quite good as a three year old who is kidnapped by aliens. Close Encounters came out in 1977; it had to compete with Star Wars. Both films were referenced in Independence Day(1996). Times have changed. Steven Spielberg directed War of the Worlds(2005) and that film showed us some nasty, malevolent aliens from Mars. In the 1970's and the 1980's, Spielberg was willing to show us optimistic tales of encounters with space aliens. Close Encounters is a keeper.",1308873600,2,1741,4.921768707482993
9986,5,076780192X,"I hadn't watched this movie in years, but I rewatched it recently and was pleased with how well it's aged. The plot is quite simple: a group of people are inspired by UFOs to meet the aliens who changed their lives. However, the beauty is in how that simple plot is realized in the film. One thing this film gets right is its portrayal of first contact. It's a profound event. The people contacted by the aliens undergo dramatic changes in their lives. This makes the movie all the more emotionally compelling. By the end of the film, you feel like you've gone on an emotional journey as well.

The movie's slow pace and subtle cinematography are a nice change from most movies released nowadays. At over 2 hours, the movie crawls for most of the time presenting dialogue and images. Initially, that sounds like a recipe for disaster (or 2001 Space Odyssey) but it works really well in this context. Slowing the pace down allows viewers to feel like you're traveling with the characters and for the tension to build. It also makes the climax all the more rewarding.

The special effects still hold up pretty well and have been improved for this 30th anniversary edition. I haven't watched this on blu-ray so I don't know how the quality holds up there. I did think some of the blacks could have been cleaned up to remove some of the ""static,"" but I have to say it also gives the movie a nice ""older"" feel.

Overall, this is a sci-fi classic and still probably the most realistic depiction of contact with aliens ever to come out of Hollywood. Too bad Hollywood just doesn't make movies like this anymore!",1307664000,,1604,4.5625

9996,5,076780192X,"This film, perhaps Spielberg's best among his more entertaining fair, is essentially about the war between wonder and fear. As human beings, we have an innate sensibility of fearing the unknown as a defense mechanism to combat those things which could be hostile and threaten our existence, be they at the individual level or at the societal level. History is filled with examples, usually of a tragic nature, in which human beings perpetrate against each other the worst kinds of inhumanity in the name of fear, be it religious, economic, or political. In large conflicts, human beings on each side rationalize that their adversaries are heinous monsters intentionally engaging in wrong-doing as an act of evil. Both sides, in other words, believe they are on the side ""right"" and vilify the other. In this circumstance, all behavior is dictated by fear rather than wonder.

Countered to this inbred ""fear"" is also the capacity to engage in wonder. Human beings are also infinitely curious, and our curiosity stems from a child-like desire of wanting to know, to understand, and even to touch that which may be different. Fear and wonder are very incompatible bedfellows which reside in each of us. It is a constant challenge for the human race to decide which emotion will have its say in terms of behavior: wonder or fear. Fear is about anger, stereotypes, barriers, burning bridges, and making war. Wonder is about happiness, trust, letting go, being curious, and being vulnerable; it may be ultimately linked to those emotions associated with love. In the brilliant SF film ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", Spielberg and co. explore how these two opposing views clash in the midst of our ""third"" encounter with aliens from outer space.

Early on, the story draws the divisions between those characters driven by fear as opposed to those who are willing to throw off fear in favor of wonder. Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and David Laughlin (Bob Balaban) are the two investigators who are led around the world by the series of inter-connected coincidences which lead them to believe something extra-terrestrial is going on. They are in the wonder department. And so is Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a mid-west suburbanite who has an amazing ""encounter"", as well as a little boy, Barry, in the same geographical region who is enthralled with the coming of the aliens.

The US military, Roy's wife Ronnie Nearie (Teri Garr) and their family, and at first Jillian (Melinda Dillon), the mother of the little boy, belong in the fear department. In a simultaneously poignant and revealing scene, when the aliens come to visit the little boy's house one night, his mother shuts all the doors. Then suddenly, Barry opens one of the doors revealing a splendor of light and magic spilling from beyond. Jillian runs to the door and quickly closes it. She will not forsake her child's safety for Barry's wonder and curiosity. Over and over, Barry displays a kind of innocent curiosity for the encounter while his mother can only react in fear. Lacking the fear of his mother, Barry eventually leaves the safety of his mother and joins the aliens.

Ronnie Neary not only can't understand Roy's mood-swing from his encounter, she doesn't want to know anything about it. Something has been planted in Roy's mind, presumably by the aliens during his encounter, and he can't reconcile the image and its meaning. But Ronnie only fears what she doesn't understand. Roy doesn't do himself any favors when he turns his family upside down, but neither does his family attempt to find out what's troubling him. Fear becomes her dominating emotion while Roy is desperate to understand. The US military acts similarly to Ronnie as they want no outside interference in regards to the alien encounters, and continually deny the presence of these encounters.

Ultimately, by film's end, we learn that all the fears of the characters have been unfounded, a delusion on their part. All consternation and trouble, which are usually required for a story to be compelling, were human-created and not of alien origin. The encounters were designed out of benevolence, not hostility. Only one character, that of Barry's mother, realizes her error and changes from one who is at first fearful to someone who is willing to embrace wonder.

I believe fear rarely serves the human race. Certainly, fear has its place if a rhino is charging at you in the jungle. But if all human behavior is dictated by fear rather than a child-like wonder, we will miss out on some of the best of human experience, which I think may be Spielberg's point. The encounters and the close encounter of the third kind are only possible when human beings tear down the walls, throw down the barriers, and build bridges to the unknown. Certainly the unknown may be filled with snakes. But it could be filled with treasure also. The child risks falling by walking on two legs. Maybe adults should learn to do the same. Are we going to be a species who continually hides under the bed in the face of the unknown, or are we going to be the little boy who opens the door into the world of unknown wonders?",1295308800,2,5151,4.881142857142857

9999,3,076780192X,"Truly, one of the finest movies of its kind EVER made. What can I say that most on this board haven't already said? I was in grade school when this movie came out and 2 scenes will be forever etched in my mind until I die. The first being where Jillian is heading towards her house as the night sky parts with these eerie and brilliant lights descending from above. That was just downright scary because their trajectory is taking them straight to the side of her home.

The second scene came moments later where Jillian's son, Barry is being pulled in a very frightening tug-of-war between mother and alien through the pet slot in the doorway! The music and the lighting increased the tension of that scene to such a crescendo! That entire segment was so frightening because you could barely see the aliens fingers latched onto Barry's arms. To this day, I've argued that Jillian ""lost"" the tug-of-war because the aliens were simply stronger than she was instead of several people insisting that she let Barry go as not to hurt him for fear of her son being pulled apart or injured.

I'm no parent, but I've always believed that a parent will go through great lengths to keep her child protected or die trying and not give up so easily. But that's me. As far as the movie is concerned, it'll always be a 5-star rating. My 3 stars are in reference to the Blu-ray transfer. I will admit, that my Blu-ray transfer expectations were a bit high. Okay, very high:) I'd just watched the incredible The Dark Knight on Blu-ray and that just blew my mind!

The transfer for this movie is not too bad, it's just not as great as I was expecting it to be. Especially with it being the 30th anniversary edition. But that's totally my fault. The sound however is incredible and some scenes look more sharper and crisper than others which was annoying. There were spotty graininess in some scenes and that disappointed me too. That's not to say that I lost my money purchasing this item. One of the pluses of this disc is that it contains all three versions. I really loved that. My personal favorite has always been the Director's Cut, but all three of them are pretty good.

It's funny because I wonder if the 3 versions on the 1 disc have somehow retarded the sharpness of the Blu-ray process itself. It's worth taking into consideration because not many discs have 3 different versions of the same movie on 1 disc; maybe alternate endings, but not an entire movie. That's been my experience anyway. With that said, I'm still glad that I got this movie and in this format as well. Watching Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind never gets old. And with my Blu-ray BD dvd player, big screen tv and my entertainment system, I just can't go wrong. The way Close Encounters was meant to be watched!",1288656000,3,2777,4.52589641434263

I haven't gone through the entire set but spot checking the original theatrical version, it looks like they just dumped the DVD edition master on to the Blu-Ray without any attempt at clean up.
Lots of artifacts and graininess. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be watching CE3K on Blu-Ray or DVD as the graininess was rivaling Battlestar Galactica on DVD.

10011,5,076780192X,"Loved this film.  I have the Collectors Edition and know nothing about Bluray, though it seems there are many reviews that talk more about Bluray and techy stuff than about the story. I don't have bluray, and my DVD is just fine!  I very much enjoyed the 2nd disc Collectors Edition, and the discussions with Spielberg, the editors, artists, musicians, actors and others who made this such an enjoyable film.  Mainly because it was just so much FUN to watch!

I give it more than 5 stars, as all the fantasy (fantastic) scenes were made without today's help from computers.  Everything they did was done without computers and it still looked real.  As much as I love Harry Potter, and I do,  I doubt it could have been made or even attempted without computers.

I""m glad I bought the 2 disk version because the 2nd disk explained so much about the making of the film and the selection of the characters.  The little boy in the film, now all grown up explains how such a little child was able to attain the expressions, the wide eyed looks and his adorable smile that a kitchen gone crazy might have frightened a child of his age (I think he was about 4).  (He was my favorite character.)

Terry Garr was perfect in her role as the bewildered wife and Richard Dreyfus, perfect as the man whose mind had gone far off kilter so that he could follow a strange obsession placed there by the UFO, uh, characters.  Great music by John Williams (per usual) and Francois Truffaut, an excellent French actor and director brought a kind of scientific reality to the whole fantasy. Can there be UFOS?

I really like the scene on the highway near the train tracks and The chase,*SPOILER*but really ""Roy"" is such a jerk and leaves to join the mothership? I would hope they torture him up there for being such a bad father and husband. probe him good. I also dislike spielberg for commenting ""If we can communicate with beings from another planet peacefully then why not The Reds during the Cold War?"" something to that effect. Spielberg must be one helluva naive person to state something like that and believe it. I also believe that Aliens wouldn't come here, Humans are too dumb,why bother. And if they did come they would probably destroy us.
I would never want to have an encounter, The movie itself is not bad,but you go back to one place(India) then another (Muncie,Indiana) why not focus on One place and one plot? I prefer Signs to this.

Also at the beginning in the sandstorm and for other ""night"" scenes... however, during the rest of the film the picture is really great. So, once again it looks as though the people doing the Blu-Ray transfer AGAIN cut corners and tried to save money by not applying the process to the whole film. - Bottom line, this is a great movie and I think I can overlook the fact it is not perfect and still enjoy all 3 versions.

Since I live in Palhoca, Brazil(South America), it took exact 40 days for me to grab this beautifully-packed set of bluray discs (it has just arrived this morning). The endless wait has proven way beyond justified. It's simply a delightful piece of fine art.

It comes with a wonderful booklet containing several trivias about the actors and the director as well as several bios on the actors, wich is really interesting.

The three films on bluray are fantastic. You get to taste all three different views that Spielberg imagined for the movie. And being able to do that on a 42"" Full-Hd(1080p) LCD TV with the quality of bluray video and remastered 5.1 surround sound was priceless!

Paraphrasing ""Bolski"" from Ohio, who made a terrific review about this product, I would say ""To finally watch it like I did when it first came out back in 1977"" was a wonderful experience.

If you love this film the way I do or if you're another Spelberg's fan, you have to buy this box ASAP. The chance to feel this magical experience over and over again will be forever within your reach.

Best wishes for all CE3K fans!

10020,5,076780192X,"I love this movie because of the way it moves me emotionally...down to my very core. It sounds dramatic, but the humanity, the wonder, the magic of Close Encounters...it can only be seen to be understood. This movie is timeless and has a special place in my heart.

The acting is nearly flawless. It's an extreme thing to say, but the world in this film feels so entirely genuine and real because of the emotion we see conveyed on screen. The direction and writing is, of course, awesome. Special effects--still impressive, and almost more convincing than the stuff we see today. Beautiful cinematography, and the musical score is cosmic and moving.

If you think the movie starts out slow...just wait. It's the final act that makes the build up oh-so-worth it. If you haven't seen it, you must.

I'm not very good at writing reviews...I tend to go all over the place. So I won't try and tell you everything about this movie. Find out for yourself. But if you have seen it (which you likely have), watch it again. Notice how it makes you feel, how it transforms the idea of fear into wonder and hope, how it makes you look at the sky at night.

Close Encounters is Spielberg at his best. I hope he does another one like this in the future. This kind of movie is rare.",1266192000,2,1267,4.471861471861472
10021,5,076780192X,"Other than to remark that this is remarkably sentimental film, of the ""How I wish aliens would come down and save humanity"" ilk, I'll limit myself to the quality of the Blu-ray transfer.

This is one of the best BDs I've yet seen, essentially equalling the quality of ""The Fifth Element"" and coming close to ""The Searchers"". It is absolutely of demo quality, with extreme sharpness and detail, and little or no visible edge enhancement. The black levels are unbelievable. Most of the time it's difficult to see any difference between the film's blacks and the letterbox banding on my Pioneer Kuro. Makes me glad I bought it!",1265760000,7,624,4.777777777777778

10035,5,076780192X,"This is a revised review of my previous...because I need to echo once again how amazing this set is.  Bluray is such an incredible, versatile, and exciting format.  Close Encounters is the kind of transfer which is why I bought a BD player to begin with.  It contains all three versions of the film, so if you're partial to one, it's here.  It has been so meticulously remastered that it looks like it came out last year.  It was like seeing it for the first time, every detail from the knick-knacks in the Neary home to the detailing on the alien craft are rendered beautifully.  Each film has 2 lossless sound options, which is almost unheard of.  A DTS-HD MA and a Dolby True HD 5.1.  I prefer the DTS, but both are very powerful.  Not only does it feature house-rattling bass, but ambient and directional effects are exhilarating.  Dialogue reproduction is crisp and spot on.  Simply put, it will never look or sound this good again.  It was restored from the original source.  This was the first of Spielberg's oeuvre to be released and the follow-up have not been disappointing.  ""Minority Report"" is a revelation, ""War of the Worlds"" and Saving Private Ryan"" ...all of these are demo-worthy, reference grade transfers.

The price has dropped on this set dramatically even from when I wrote my original review.  It is still one of my go-to discs to demo my blu-ray, so people can see what the format can do for a film that is 33 years old!  I cannot wait to see ""Jaws"" and ""A.I."" added to the repertoire.  Close Enounters is not just a movie, but an experience.  It reminded us to look at the stars with awe and wonder and dream of the possibilities.  The story is expertly crafted and still relevant and relatable.  The fact this transfer is so spectacular makes it a new experience with all the awe and childlike wonder flooding back to me.

10036,5,076780192X,"If you are looking at these reviews you already know what a great story Spielberg put to film back in the 70s and like me may well have fond memories of watching this one in the theatre. You likely, therefore, are more interested in how it all comes across on blu-ray:

I got this a couple months back and I have been very impressed. For the obsessive (or just curious) there are multiple versions of the movie and you can even select to have an on-screen indication of whether or not each scene you are watching was in other versions or not. I am a bit of a purist and tend to like the theatrical version but there are good and bad things (relatively) to say about each version. In this case, you don't have to compromise...you get them all. They even include a card summarizing the different versions and their differences so you can choose before you hit 'play'.

I disagree with another reviewer who felt the transfer was bad. I feel the picture is very sharp, way sharper than any way I have seen this in the past. For example, in prior versions early in the movie when the alien ships turn their lights out, you could only ""see"" the ship moving among the stars by seeing some brighter stars wink out, now you can see all the stars and the ""shadow"" of the ship has substance. The discs sound great as well.

Overall, I am very impressed and recommend this to anyone, especially at this price (I paid quite a bit more than the current price and still feel I got a good value).",1263168000,9,1480,4.335740072202166

10041,5,076780192X,"""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is Steven Spielberg's 1977 blockbuster that examines how a man's life is changed forever when he realizes through a series of unexplained events that other beings exist in the universe. Roy Neary, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a happy family man when, one night, a spaceship flys over him in his truck. This leads him to investigate the incident, with him ultimately losing everything he has, including his family; his investigation becomes a compulsion that even he can't control. The movie was one of the biggest blockbusters of the 1970's and is the best film that explores aliens and the unknown. This beautiful 2 disc DVD set is loaded with extras including interviews with Dreyfuss and Spielberg, 11 deleted scenes, a making-of documentary, a 1977 featurette called ""Watching The Skies"", plus much more.

When I watched it with the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack, it became out of sync with the picture starting with the first Richard Dreyfus scene with his family. This was during the ""Theatrical Edition"" version on the disc. Fortunately, this awesome version also includes the DTS HD soundtrack as well.

I admired the ""brilliant"" UFO designs, and the stunning performance of Richard Dreyfuss. Now, I can see that this film hasn't experienced any wear and tear, except maybe the commercial products that were used in the film. The special effects are still mesmerizing, the characters are still engaging, and even though I'm a fan of John Williams, the otherworldly music is still spectacular. Francois Truffaut steals the show as Claude Lacombe, but Dreyfuss is also worthy of mention. He plays Roy Neary, a man who has just had a ""close encounter"" with a trio of unidentified flying objects, and is becoming increasingly obssessive with a mountain-like shape that he seems to see in everyday objects. He should have won the oscar for this film, instead of ""The Goodbye Girl.""

Thank goodness that Star Wars, which was released in theaters in the same year, didn't overshadow this arguably important sci-fi film. It's one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made, and it one of my favorites alongside 2001: A Space Odyssey & John Carpenter's The Thing.

I am 33 years old, and must confess that I had never seen this film in its entirety. As I am a huge fan of Alien and similarly themed films, I decided to make this the day to start my journey into this disc set. I watched the original ""Theatrical"" ed, and will update my review as I watch the others. PQ 3.5 and AQ 5. I was a little disappointed in the picture quality, which displays noticable grain. I've seen old films with better PQ.

First, the performance of the lead character was one of the most heartfelt I've ever seen. His desire to explore and be a part of this otherworldly miracle is just stirring. I absolutely loved the score. I think that music and scoring was, perhaps used much more effectively in this time period. The effects, even for an older film, were outstanding and with a little suspension of disbelief-convincing. The space ship at the end is just incredible, as is the return of the other ""abductees"".

10075,4,076780192X,"The sign of a classic movie is how well it ages and ""Close Encounters ..."" seems to get better over the years and the more times you watch it.  This film has many signs to show that it was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" from the opening sequence to the massive role of music to the whole feel of the movie and yet Spielberg did not simply copy Kubrick's formula but instead took the genre on to another level putting his own stamp on it.  Franchises like The ""X-Files"" and many others have at least been influenced themselves by this film and the special effects are spectacular for the time given there was little if any CGI to the scale of today and yet the visual effects hold up very well even by today's standards.

This one-disc Collector's Edition is also a real treat for fans as it has been restored very, very well for an excellent picture and sound quality.  I watched this in DTS surround and anamorphic video and the impact was fabulous!  I finally did justice to my system as it gave all my speakers a great workout.  I tried to find picture imperfections but in vain.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are no Special Features to speak of and for that you'll need to get the 2-Disc version.  For those who just want a great Director's Cut version of this film and are happy with just the one disc like myself, this is a very good dvd version to get.

Highly recommended!",1229990400,3,1441,4.387218045112782
10076,4,076780192X,"Strange events around the world foreshadow the first contact between mankind and aliens.  Several people who encounter UFOs are psychically imprinted with an impulse to converge on the meeting area, including a worker for the phone company (Richard Dreyfuss) and a mother (Melinda Dillon) searching for her abducted son (Cary Guffey).

I'm not sure which of the three (at least) versions of this film I saw.  I didn't get to see the interior of the ship at the end, but I did see the scene in which Dreyfuss tears up his yard to construct a replica of the mountain in his visions; that may provide a clue to those who are more knowledge about this movie than I.  There may be a superior version of this film out there, but I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  No one can convey that sense of wonder better than Stephen Spielberg at his best.  The story structure is very effective, alternating between the intellectually stimulating narrative of two scientists (Francois Truffaut and Bob Balaban) who are investigating the unusual phenomena and the intense, personal stories of two people who don't understand what is happening to them.  The wonderful finale provides a nice contrast to most science fiction films, which are really teched up action flicks with violent endings.",1228867200,,1273,4.8657407407407405

10080,5,076780192X,"Close Encounters is one of those Spielberg movies where you can really feel the magic. It isn't a downer, and it isn't the kind of movie that makes you think about the world's problems. Even the US government seems to have the best intentions when it comes to the aliens. The whole movie wears a little smirk on it's face.  Masterfully done, Encounters has some simple but effective visual effects and a emotional and powerful soundtrack. The casting is good considering it was early in the careers of several of the people involved. Richard Dreyfuss plays his character perfectly. Roy Neary is a regular joe that suddenly is confronted with some life changing events that he can't understand. The messages that he is getting in his head confuse him all the more and Dreyfuss does a perfect job of illustrating that.  The supporting cast turns in good performances as well and really give the impression that you are watching a documentary rather than a work of fiction. The best parts of the movie in my opinion is when they are showing you clips from around the world of different UFO encounters and the research team finding evidence of an alien presence. When they're in the Mongolian desert and they find the freighter Cotopoxi. The same ship that was lost for real in the Bermuda Triangle. It still gives me chills. They slowly pan across and you see a huge ship sitting in the middle of the sand. Oooooh man, great shot.  Bottom Line: This is another one of Spielberg's classics. You must get it on DVD for the multitude of extras that are on the 2 disc set. If you haven't seen it yet and you like either UFO's and/or Spielberg, you won't be disappointed.",1220313600,,1663,4.6305084745762715

unlike more recent computer-generated ""eye-gasm"" style sci-fi flicks, CEOTTK begs us to fill in the gaps with the wonder of our imaginations - and then surprises/relieves us with each resolution and new question - such a ride!  the end is a bit ""answery"" and it could be trimmed.  for example, it might be more powerful and self-consistent to *not* see the actual creatures themselves, and instead witness them only through their amazing light-shadows and sonic-auras.  but the film is light-years ahead of the show-every-detail computer over-generation that's become a staple of the sci-fi genre

in combination with their judicious use, the special effects are clearly analog and make the overall effect mysterious and *life* like to me.  there is something about their imperfection that actually makes them feel more alive - amazing!  i noticed this especially with the spaceships and their movement

the film uses music wonderfully, both implicitly and explicitly - so rare to have the soundtrack be a part of the plot itself, and another brilliant element of this tight movie

i appreciate the juxtaposed mania of ""everyday life"" contrasted with the transporting awe of a world that is larger than our expectations, and i appreciate the ""surprise"" that this larger world can be inspiring to us, and not just threatening",1219363200,2,1595,5.007575757575758

This film was made in 1977, prior to the well explored theme of government conspiracies with evil aliens intent on colonizing Earth. Earlier and later sci-fi films (with the exception of E.T.) have generally attributed much less benign motives to space aliens.

Spielberg was able to get his audience to believe in well intentioned aliens interested in making first contact with authorities on Earth.

Finally, the 1977 uncut version of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" has been release on DVD.  The first release on DVD still had three scenes missing from the 1977 version that I saw on the theaters.  I did miss seeing the man with his family commenting on how far behind the aliens was in technology when it came to our highway systems.  I also miss Ray wife (Teri Carr) complaining that she was not going to get a job and Ray looking at the pillow and seeing the mountain shape in it.  The third scene was included with the outtakes.  It was the scene with Ray walking into the Electric Power Plant (his job) and talking to his co-workers.

The first two scenes were not in the outtakes so the movie was missing something.  These two scenes were less than a minute each but they really stood out in the film.  I had to wait 30 years for this movie to be release the way I originally saw it in the theater in 1977.

If you enjoy the 1980 re-release version of this film it is also in this package and so is the release 1997 DVD copy.  If you get it now it cost a lot less than it did in November of 2007 so, if you enjoyed the original versions of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" take advantage of this offer.",1215302400,2,1302,4.126984126984127

These are some of the best films in the genre, and they're all getting the treatment they deserve on the new high definition format.

If you haven't seen the movie in any of its three versions (all of which are available here), no plot summary can do it justice. It's worth a blind purchase based just on its pedigree (Spielberg, fresh off of Jaws, is at his creative peak) and reputation (8 Oscar noms, #64 on the AFI top 100, 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) . If you need to know a little something before jumping in, it's the story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss) who, after witnessing a series of unexplained bright lights, becomes consumed by an obsession with UFOs that tears his family apart. At the same time, a multinational group of scientists investigating a series of mysterious events begin preparations for the first diplomatic visit from extraterrestrials.

So the film is a classic. What about the disc? First, this is the only Blu-ray I've come across that doesn't have that cheesy blue plastic top. The packaging is a stylish cardboard slipcase with shiny metallic artwork of a bright light on the horizon. Along with the two discs, which I'll get to in a minute, are a book containing on-set photographs and biographies of the cast & crew, and a poster outlining the differences between the three versions of the film. These are the kind of paper inserts I wish more movies came with instead of worthless lists of chapter titles and ads for other movies. All told, this set looks very nice on the shelf.

But how does it look on the screen? Great. Bright lights against a dark sky usually spell disaster for image quality, but everything looks as it should here.

The transfers look great on my 51"" HDTV, and the sound is fine given the film's age.  Over the years, I have bought a CLV Criterion LD, another version on LD that is a terrible transfer, the standard DVD, and now the Blu-Ray.  I have one complaint.  I don't like any of Spielberg's cuts.  I believe this would be a better movie if EVERY scene was present except the entry into the ship, which is a meaningless light show and which Spielberg was forced to do against his better judgment.  Why not offer a version with all the cuts present and allow the owner to deselect the unwanted ones?  The CAV Criterion LD offered that feature a quarter-century ago but at a $130 premium.  The nature of the cuts is such that the movie should still flow well.  Hence, four stars instead of five.

Is there a fourth version of this film?  When I saw it at the theater in January 1978, I remember seeing the power plant AND the ship-in-the-desert scene AND the Wyoming scene with the future ""Apollo Creed,"" which appear together in none of these versions.  When I bought the Criterion version, I remember being disappointed at not seeing them.  However, Spielberg insists he didn't film the ship-in-the-desert scene until later, so I suppose he knows his own history.

The extras disc is fascinating in that you see actors whose principle work fell to the cutting room floor.  You also get to witness some very bad movie making that fortunately never saw the light of day except here.  Yet, the cut scenes involving Roy in the field before his first contact, bad as they are, make his subsequent firing easier to understand.

The collectors set with packaging is worth the FULL ASKING PRICE; It comes with three versions of the movie and Special Features on a two Blu-ray Disk (BD) set.

Disk 1 has: The Original Theatrical Version, Special Edition, and the Directors Cut.  All in 1080p High Def and with English DTS HD 5.1 or Dolby Digital TrueHD 5.1.

Disk 2 has the Special Features.

It also comes with a 30th anniversary collectors book that has information on the actors/actresses and other details of the movie.

10124,4,076780192X,"Hollywood runs 10 years behind. My friends and I were watching for UFOs in 1966. Somehow, Dreyfuss got into the three biggest movies of the 1970s. In Close Encounters, he is obsessed with an image in his mind. It turns out to be Devil's Tower in Wyoming, a vertical monolith created by erosion and the nation's first National Monument. Dreyfuss is drawn to an alien landing. ""The Third Kind"" indicates actual contact with UFOs. The film tries to create a sense of realism. So far, UFO stories have been hoaxes and science fiction. Where does Dreyfuss go with his aliens?",1203897600,,570,4.71
10135,4,076780192X,"There are some great reviews about the film, so let me just talk about the transfer. I bought the special edition dvd a few years ago. It looked good on my LG BH200, but not as good as the blu-ray version. But it's weird, some scenes look absolutely amazing, while others look grainy and over saturated. Still, it is a heck of a lot better than the dvd version. Do I recommend this blu-ray? Yes, but only if you aren't paying full price.",1203379200,2,437,4.27710843373494

I was so shocked I literally yelled out because I had NO IDEA this line existed. I have seen this movie nearly 50 times. The bad thing about the original version leaves out the Cotopaxi ship scene.

At any rate, if you love this movie this is a must have. I have the VHS, the 20 year DVD and now this 30 year. This is one od his best movies and is a classic.",1202515200,,667,4.091603053435114

I must have come up with same story in my dreams and thinking because when I saw it the first time, I was aghast at how closely it resembled my hopes and ideas about alien encounters.  I love this movie and can watch it over and over.  Richard Dreyfuss gives, what I consider, the best performance of his career.  Teri Garr was great for the part, but I fell in love with Melinda Dillon.  If it ever happens, let it happen something like this.

10138,5,076780192X,"How well I remember walking out of the theatre in 1976, and looking up at the sky as if it were a living thing! CE3K remains a beautiful metaphor for all that is unknown. For many of us, the first question will be, ""Did Steven ditch that interior of the Mothership?"" Happily, it was the first cut he made. All the good stuff is here, edited more tightly by an admittedly older and less credulous director. Yet despite his avowed ""maturity"" (read skepticism), his Director's Cut is delicious, loving, and as full of wonder as ever. I know this is unpopular: I love Spielberg for his lyricism, his poetry, and his willingness to take us ""out there."" ""Private Ryan"" was quite well-made. I've never gotten through Schindler. But in CE3K, ET, Jurassic Park, Always and others, Steven has shown me things I've always wanted to see. Though much of his industry recognition has come from his more recent work, it's always been his forays into fantasy that seemed so redolent of truth to me. In the Director's Cut, he shows that the boy within the man is still alive and luminous. Dreyfuss has never had a better turn (arguable, admittedly, when one thinks of ""Mr. Holland's Opus,"" a more mature tour-de-force for him) and Melinda Dillon is the ultimate feminine archetype. Can't recommend this highly enough. The decision to split the newer ""extras"" into three parts, across the DVDs is inconvenient, and a small matter in the face of this wonderful release.

And if you like that dreadful UFO interior, it's on the second DVD. Enjoy.",1201478400,,1526,4.7368421052631575

10141,5,076780192X,"Home video is quite a temptation for directors. It allows them to go back play with, alter, tamper and second guess themselves. We get three versions via seamless branching on Blu-ray on one disc with a disc of extras and the films presented with extras over three discs on DVD allowing us to see Spielberg's thoughts on ""CE3K"" over three different decades. The latest 30th Anniversary edition allows writer/director Steven Spielberg to fix flaws in ""CE3K"" that have bothered him for years about the film. The original theatrical version editing he felt was rushed and unfinished while the ""Special Edition"" deleted some key scenes and added a completely unnecessary trip inside the Mothership (something he later regretted). --he's edited it again (it's 2 minutes longer with some scenes lengthened and others shortened plus the trip inside the Mothership has been left to the audience's imagination). The ""Director's Cut"" works better than both versions; Spielberg has licked some of the pacing issues that dogged the original film and he has eliminated the gaudy trip inside the ship. For those fans who HAD to see the inside of the ship we still get that edition of the film which is a good thing--this is the most comprehensive version of ""CE3K"" released. This is the definitive version(s)of the film.

Interestingly, Spielberg added the last section inside the ship so he could get the financing to re-edit the film for the 1980 re-release. It was a compromise he could live with at the time but he has since reversed that opinion wisely realizing that focus groups (Columbia's marketing department got focus group feedback asking to see the inside of the ship and that's where the decision to show the inside came from)can be idiots and cause damage to a film (see ""Blade Runner"" for an example of how it can compromise a film).

The image quality is spectacular on Blu-ray and looks terrific on DVD as well. I have to give Spielberg credit; unlike, say, George Lucas, Spielberg presents his original vision with as much respect and care as he does his later revisions. You can pick and choose which version appeals to you--I liked the original version a lot in 1977, disliked the 1980 ""Special Edition"" and loved the ""Director's Cut"" of the film. What was subtle in the first version was blunt in the second and has been returned to subtle in the third version with better pacing and cuts that work better with the flow of the film. Fans of the film will love having all 3 versions so they can pick and choose which version they like.

Audio sounds terrific as well with an active 5.1 mix presented in DTS and Dolby Digital Surround. The Blu-ray also features the sound presented in lossless uncompressed TrueHD Dolby. John Williams' soaring and uplifting score is beautifully rendered.

The Blu-ray uses an interactive comparison feature ""A View from Above"" that has a pop up color/shape to tell you when there is a difference in a scene. It is color co-ordinated to which version has a difference and also to which version you are watching. It shows an image from the scene and explains what was altered. We also geta hard copy of that as well for both the Blu-ray and DVD with a ""map"" explaining the differences between the three versions and, on the other side, a reproduction of the original, effective poster (which also was used as a teaser trailer and is on the cover of the box)from 1977.

There is also a storyboard to scene comparison section as well as conceptual art done by Ralph McQuarie (who also worked on ""Star Wars"" and ""Alien"" coming up with designs for various aliens and spaceships). Complimenting these sections on storyboards and artwork is a companion 30th anniversary scrapbook. We get brief biographies and backgrounds for the key players in the film and behind-the-scenes as well as comments from Spielberg about the project and behind-the-scenes photos.

Ported over we get the extensive 1997 documentary on the making of the film as well as an interview with Spielberg from 2007 discussing his thoughts on the film, the changes he made and where the film fits for him now 30 years later as a film director. The original 1977 ""Watch the Skies"" featurette that played on TV as a promotional tie-in is included as well. A number of deleted scenes are also included. Finally we get the various theatrical trailers with the original teaser (that didn't show any scenes from the film but was compelling and artistic by itself) included as well.

All of this is housed in a sturdy cardboard case for both the Blu-ray and DVD. This set is highly recommended on both DVD and Blu-ray since it houses the ultimate edition and allows viewers to pick the version of the film they enjoyed the most. It's also a way for Spielberg to have his cake and eat it, too.",1200700800,9,4786,4.786924939467313

10143,3,076780192X,"While it's always a pleasure to see a good film presented in a better home-theater version than has ever been available, my recent screening of the Blu-Ray version of Close Encounters left me flat.

I'm not going to go on at length about why the film didn't work for me or my wife, who are both at the older end of the Baby Boom.  Suffice it to say  that there's no doubt that the movie is a fine piece of craftmanship all the way around, and the Blu-Ray pressing brings out every visual and aural detail. But none of that quality can turn a story that doesn't ""work"" into an evening of great entertainment.

There's no way to know how YOU will react, especially if you haven't watched any version in the past few years.  It might be prudent to rent the blu-ray before springing for your own copy.

Happy Blu-Ray watching, even if this re-pressing doesn't do the job for you. There are lots of great new discs out there well worth viewing and buying.",1200268800,,950,4.369318181818182

The audio is outstanding too ... the house literally shook when my subwoofer belched the presence of the mothership in the last part of the film !

Other Blu-ray disks I've bought since this one have blown me away (like the Planet Earth anthology), so I don't think the discrepancy between my dreams and reality are technology related.

Don't get me wrong, Close Encounters is entertaining no matter how many times you've seen it.  Spielberg is a master storyteller and the special features are very entertaining.  However, if you're going to by one Blu-ray disk to impress your friends and neighbors with 50"" 1080p and surround sound (and maybe your Harmony remote) - this isn't the disk to buy.",1200182400,3,883,4.634615384615385
10156,5,076780192X,"Following in Lucas's footsteps with his release of the original Star Wars as it was first presented. Spielberg does his sci-fi epic the same way with this excellent release of the 1977 UFO Classic, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. When it was first released on video back in the early 80's it was the Special Edition version which was released to theaters in 1980 with new end footage with the interiors of the Mother Ship as well as other scenes edited out entirely and replaced with other scenes or alternate versions of other scenes. In fact, the only way to ever see the original was when it aired on TV as a movie and even then the two versions were combined to fill a 3 hour time slot. In the 1990's Laserdisc owners were the first to be able to own the original version thanks to Criterion Collection laserdiscs, except that the end credits were from the 1980 version. Then in 2001, the Collector's edition came out and it was more of a marriage of the two versions as it still eliminated key scenes from the original version, yet restored the original
ending.  The Best part of this DVD set is that it pleases everyone. It has the original, complete with restored original 1977 end credits ( for the first time, The Special Edition, and the collector's edition and loads of special features including the extended teaser trailer for the first film, the trailer for the second and the advertising trailer for this ultimate colection edition.  The sound is presented in 5.1 Dolby and DTS format on all 3 discs. If you have the right stereo equipment, you could play the original in its original stereo sound format...but why. I'm all for nostalgia but this is one of those movies where you need to have the subwoofer active, especially at the final scenes where the mother ship blows out the glass in the observation tower. The video quality is also superb. I can only imagine what this film sounds like and looks like on the BLU-RAY version also available and for about the same price as this set through online discount retailers.  A must for any Spieleberg fan.
A little bit of trivia regarding both Star Wars and CE3K is that at the time of the release, both directors were reportedly in Hawaii, discussing the possibileity that their indiviual movies would flop  Both films were very succesful.

Having seen this film in the theater many moons ago and then on laser disc
much later, I was not sure what Speilberg and company could do to improve on this--his best work to date. One could argue ""Schindler's List"" must have been better since it won a Best Film Oscar, while ""Encounters"" won ""everything but.""
But that's the old apples and oranges scenario which precludes making
comparisons of films simply because is has common directors.
From John Williams' haunting score to Richard Dreyfuss"" virtuoso acting performance as the water and power man trying to deal with the surreal
this film holds up well after 30-odd years. Indeed, Close Encounters takes its place with the great sci-fi films like ""War of the Worlds""
and ""2001"" which provided an original aproach, based on scientific principals instead of rubber monsters tossing Buicks around New York.

10161,5,076780192X,"Close Encounters is thirty years old and can be considered a classic among cinema fanatics.  The movie was released when special effects were in their infancy.  Movies like Star Wars had just come out and the idea of bringing UFO's to life was becoming possible.  Now thirty years later movies like this seem very simple.  Although the story never grows old and now in hi-def it is well worth another look.

From the minute I got my hands on this set I realized how nice it actually is.  Containing just two discs but hours worth of features.  The first disc contains the movies in three different editions.  The Original Theatrical Version contains the movie how it was originally seen on the big screen.  Special Edition is the same version that was released several years ago with a few additional features that was added to the Theatrical Version.  The Director's Cut contains additional parts of the movie that were Steven Spielberg intended to be in his movie.  For all of you confused don't worry the set comes with a high quality glossy timeline sheet with the extra parts that were added to each edition.  On this disc you are also given an option to run the movie with all the extras.  So essentially you have four versions of this film.

When I started watching this movie I was in awe.  This was one of the best hd transfers of a movie I have ever seen.  I have watched numerous movies over ten years old and this one looked best.  The color and visuals looked superb.  The sound is superb and the way it was intended to sound.

For those of you who have never seen the movie it involves several characters.  A group of scientists are researching strange discoveries that are taking place like a fleet of WWII planes that went missing thirty years prior.  The discoveries are just the beginning as UFO's begin to make appearances all over the world.  Richard Dreyfuss is one of the people who witnesses the UFO activity and from that point his life is changed.  Trying to discover what the meaning of this is.  Of course in the meantime his family and work life are completely disrupted.  Although this is just the beginning of this mysterious journey.

Close Encounters is a magical movie to say the least.  The story is timeless and has been copied for many years without the same success.  The special effects have improved greatly over the years but movie still remains a classic.  Now on Blu-ray this movie gives people a whole new reason to own it.  The extras make it well worth it.

There's a lot of stuff here for fans of this movie. Yes there are some bad spots in the movie as far as video quality, but I don't know that there was anything else they could do to repair problems with the masters.

One thing that I'd like to add to the other reviews is audio. I have the Panasonic DMP-BD30K bitstreaming the audio to a Denon AVR-3808ci receiver. The audio is fantastic. There's one scene when Roy is in the utility truck stopped at the train tracks checking his map. When the UFO shines the light on the truck and everything starts shaking, it felt the the UFO was over my house. I can't remember a movie that's ever worked the subwoofer so long or hard before.

I do have a detraction from the release however. I think classic movies like this with all the bonus features ect. really need IME/PiP. People that are fans of the movie are going to be the majority of purchasers of this, and as such, are more likely to want IME stuff.",1198108800,,1093,4.321951219512195
10176,2,076780192X,"The movie focuses primarily on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an electric line repairman who goes to work one night to fix a massive power outage and sees several low flying spacecraft.  Many others see these craft including Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon from A Christmas Story) whose son is later abducted by the aliens.  At the same time, a group of researchers who apparently work for the government travels around the world gathering information on various alien sightings and encounters.  All of this comes together when everyone converges on one spot to find... well, that's the question that plagues all of them.

The government researcher scenes tend to be chaotic and confusing.  It's not unusual to have to sit through a few minutes of incomprehensible material before you can finally understand what's going on at the very end of the scene.  They also didn't add a whole lot to the film, especially given the amount of time they take up.  The plot line involving Roy Neary is the most interesting.  After his encounter, he's driven by strange compulsions but he doesn't understand what they mean or how to deal with them.  His family gets pretty freaked out, especially his wife (Teri Garr).  If his wife wasn't screaming all the time, this would have been a great story, but she gets old very quickly.

The climax of the film involves a light show that lasts about twenty minutes as various alien ships dart around, hover, and finally land.  They then play a rousing tune for a few minutes to communicate even though they give the earthmen no way whatsoever to put the notes into any meaning or context.  It felt like an endless nightmare watching this scene drag on and on before it was finally over.  I'm fine with a peaceful encounter but this could have been done in one fourth the time with absolutely nothing lost.

It's difficult for me to recommend this movie.  For hard-core sci fi or Spielberg fans, you should see it once for yourself because it is one of the milestones in the genre.

Other than that the outdoor scenes are great, and the colors and sound are awesome. If you have a Samsung DLP, though, you will have to watch it with the DNIe off. The picture is not as sharp, but the snow is not as bad.

It could have been set up so that all were on one and you chose which version from the main menu.  The different cuts are a smallish part of the whole and could fit on the one disk.  Besides, putting it on three parts also makes for the stand-alone commentary to be spread out over the three disks, which is an odd thing to do.  As to the film, they could have left the special edition go altogether.

10179,4,076780192X,"Just thought I would bring a matter to the attention of those interested in this set, especially those who already own it. Though of course each of the three versions of CE3K are offered with the DTS audio option in the languages menu (as was the case with the original DVD release) the set I own returns to the default Dolby Digital 5.1. And it is the case with ALL THREE of the discs. I highlight ""DTS 5.1"", then select play, and trying this numerous times, but is still playing in DD 5.1. Just in case, to check to see whether if it is my Pioneer DVD player that is acting up, I tried several other DVDs (including the above-mentioned first DVD release of CE3K) and they are accepting the selection. So my question to any owners of this set would be: Does anyone else experience this, or might I regard this as just a isolated defect for the set I own? I do plan to exchange the set to see if another one would have this same issue. Though I feel the DD 5.1 quite adequate in most instances, I do find (to my ears at least) that the DTS audio is often more rich and has a more seamless surround perspective. Regardless of one's preference, I want of course what I pay for in any product, per the advertisement.

Anyone else encounter this problem? Feedback on this issue will be greatly appreciated from fellow CE3K enthusiasts.

As an aside--I do prefer the original theatrical version as the best of the three offered, but it's neat to have all three available, and the poster diagram included (reverse of the great theater poster) is useful to refer to at, at least initially to sort out the cuts and additions.",1197244800,,1617,4.404682274247492

I later bought the ultimate director's cut LD (the same ultimate director's cut on this release) and was really disappointed at the low level of detail even though the sound was really good. I resisted buying the DVD because that I didn't want to buy it again while not being certain that the picture would be really great. LDs' sound have always put the sound on DVDs to shame. So I waited for a Superbit version of the film but it never came. When I saw that it would be released on Blu-ray I simply jumped at the change and pre-ordered it right away.
When the discs arrived I was extremely pleased that the picture at last was of a quality that the film deserves. There are film grain visible but it doesn't matter since almost all 35mm releases have visible film grain on Blu-ray disc (I expect the same is true of HD DVD releases too). The picture was quite simply magnificent, the level of detail was very rich and the colors were very vibrant. The colors of the picture of BD releases is what I really am impressed with and this movie shines.
The sound was a little different matter. I use a PS3 to watch BD movies with an optical cable to my Yamaha amp with only Dolby Digital decoder (no DTS decoder) so when I watch the movies I use the DD track if available. The DD core of the Dolby TrueHD track was only 448 kbps instead of 640 kbps (all other Dolby TrueHD titles that I have have a 640 kbps DD core) and it was a little underwhelming, being the same sound quality as the DD track on DVDs. But when I set up my PS3 to decode the Dolby TrueHD track as a 2 channel LPCM track the soundtrack really excelled. The film originally was mixed in Dolby surround so to use the surround processor on my amp to play the surround sound in mono on my back speakers didn't bother me. The detail in the sound, especially at the end of the film, was so rich. I know this is not a fair assessment of the Dolby TrueHD sound, but Sony should have but a 640 kbps core on the TrueHD track, like with the Spider-man trilogy. I am really looking forward to getting an amp with HDMI input to process the true HD sound from both Dolby TrueHD and uncompressed PCM BDs (and DTS-HD MA when the PS3 can decode it).

The extras were basically the same as on my old LD Sony release with a great in-depth documentary on the making of the movie, the special edition (released in 1980) and director's cut. It also included a new 2007 interview with Spielberg reflecting on the movie after 30 years (the documentary was made in 1997, 20 years after the original release). In the case there was a booklet with some text on the making of the film with lots of pictures and a fold out with the film poster on one side and on the other side there is a outline of the differences of the three versions of the film with three timelines (one for each version) and notes pointing to various points with comments. What I really miss is a commentary track with Spielberg on each of the versions. I don't think that there is a single movie of his that has a commentary track on either BD or DVD. It would be perfect with a commentary track.

As it stands this release is really good. Some have complained on the lack of a BD plastic cover and I can understand it but with this content it is well worth the price (some have complained on that too) and I would recommend this release to all sci-fans.

Addition on 17. January 2008:
I have since I reviewed it bought an amp with HDMI to hear the uncompressed PCM sound from my PS3. I must say how that the sound is truly  amazing. It is so full and detailed. The bass, especially in the scene with Dreyfuss in the truck in the beginning, is truly spectacular. The sequence at the end behind Devil's Tower is a feast for the ear. I have only been able to get the HD sound from the Dolby TrueHD track but I would expect the DTS HD-MA track is equally impressive since both is a lossless format.",1197072000,2,4029,4.2490221642764014

10195,5,076780192X,"I've owned hundreds of laserdiscs and DVDs over the past few decades and I have to tell you this release is quality form the ground up. Here are a few reasons why I think this is my favorite version of any movie I've purchased.

1.) Main Menu. The main menu resembles the light display form the end of the film and the lights blink in time with the notes of the music. While this isn't a huge deal, it shows the level of detail that the producers of this version went to in order to make the ownership experience better. While the lights play in time to the music, scenes from the film appear across the light rectangle, giving a glimpse into what you're about to watch.

2.) Soundtrack. The DTS ES soundtrack is amazing and I think this is the first time this film has been given the DTS-ES treatment. Deep rumbling bass for the ships remind me of some of the things that made me love this movie when I saw it when I was only 12 years old.

3.) Image. Holy cow! It hasn't looked this good since 1977! Colors are rich and the print is pristine. There are some minor artifacts in a few sections, like when Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is being questioned in the government trailer, but they look like film grain issues not compression artifacts.

4.) Content. The two-disc set is loaded with features. The best of these is the ""View From Above"" setting, which shows you interactively where scenes differ from the original 1977 version. A text sentence and small image are displayed when something differs, giving a terrific, at-a-glance look at the differences among the three versions of the film. With three versions, it's hard to keep all the changes straight just looking at the included full-color, printed chronology but the on-disc version of this is stellar. Simply the best presentation I've seen.

5.) Extras. The original 1977 featurette and a new, 30th anniversary documentary are included along with trailers. This disc is loaded! The interviews with Spielberg were riveting, and Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon and ""one-take"" Cary (Child ""Barry"" in the movie) all provide terrific insight to how this was made. On top of that you get a full-color reproduction of the movie poster with a chronology of the three versions on the back-side. The poster measures about 13 x 17, but that's not exact I didn't use a ruler I'm eyeballing. There's also a full-color booklet (about 30 pages) outlining the creation of the movie with some great behind the scenes photos.

In short, this disc had everything I could've wanted and more.",1196035200,5,2548,4.701793721973094
10196,5,076780192X,"I bought a Blu ray player a few months ago.  At 39 years old I was really hoping to see some of my favorite movies in this new HD format.  Some movies seem to really benefit from this format (Kubrick's re-releases, Fifth Element, etc.).  And some movies don't seem to take full advantage of the HD format.

So it is with great pleasure that I say that this edition of Close Encounters of the Third Kind is quite simply ""amazing!""  Yes, the film is 30 years old.  And some grain is to be expected.  But wow, what a transfer!  The colors pop off the screen.  The contrast is nice and sharp, but not in a bad way.  The dark scenes are virtually flawless.  The color tones and overall look of the entire film is breahtaking.  The audio easily makes this a reference Blu Ray disc and will really test your system.

I'm not sure how much of the look of this film is due to the recent digital remastering and how much is simply due to the HD format, but the end result is enough to give you goose bumps.

The movie may be 30 years old, but this transfer makes it look as though it was released this year.

Worth noting is, thanks to the Blu Ray format, this release is just two discs (not 3 discs as in the standard def format).  All three versions of the film (original Theatrical release, Special Edition release, and the edition for this set, Director's Cut) are ALL on the first disc.  Disc two contains all the special features.  And there's hours of non-filler, must-watch stuff on this disc too. A 2007 interview with Spielberg and cast talking about the versions, an almost 2-hour documentary from Collector's Edition release, 42 minute ""Making of"" documentary.  After watching all the special features I want to go back and watch the film again.

The Director's Cut seems to be the one to watch since it is Speilberg's idea of the how the movie should look.  Worth noting is the deirector's cut of the movie removes the scene inside the mother ship.  Wich Speilberg admits in the special features was a compromise with the studio to fund a few extra scenes for the Special Edition.  (The ""Director's Cut"" is a combination and re-cut of the original release and the special edition.)

In colclusion, a fantastic release that seems to embrace the benefits that the Blu Ray format offers.  A stunning and breathtaking transfer of an already great movie.  The transfer is so good that you'll feel like you're watching it for the first time all over again.  I suspect this release will be in most Blu Ray owner's libraries.",1195862400,62,2520,4.50551876379691
10197,5,076780192X,"As a HUGE CE3K dork, and someone who's gonna eventually own this ANYWAY, it is both with a sense of complete ridiculousness and a sense of, well, MORE ridiculousness, that I post the following questions...

Being familiar with the '77 version of the film by way of my childhood and the lovely and amazing Criterion laserdisc, I'm curious about a few shots that Spielberg had removed from the film on laserdisc and included only as trims on the ends of the appropriate sides. And those are...

1) The UFO passing over Neary's truck as he speeds towards 'Harper Valley', which didn't appear until the Special Edition. Did they include that in the '77 version on DVD? Or is it the proper longer shot of Neary in his truck as he drives along?

2) The extra, if highly non-important, shots of folks in neighboring yards going about their 'regular' business as Neary watches from his window after building Devil's Tower in his living room. Are they there?

3) The shot of Neary, Jillian and LARRY! actually escaping the helicopter (""Go for the mountain!""). Is it in there?

Okay, that's it. Just stupid me wondering aloud about something I'll find out for myself soon enough.

Love,
Big Dork",1195862400,,1185,4.728155339805825

10202,5,076780192X,"OK, here's a review of the DVD itself. (5 stars because the studio finally has released all 3 cuts of the film)  There's never enough info out there on the DVD content alone, but there are hundreds of people's reviews and opinions of the movie.  Suffice it to say I love the film, always have; simply one of Spielberg's best films ever.  And to now have the actual 1977 cut of the film on DVD is a huge payoff for fans of this modern classic film.

OK, this standard DVD release is on 3 discs.  The 1977 Original Theatrical Version on disc 1; the 1980 Special Edition on disc 2; and the 1998 Collector's Edition (aka The Director's Cut) on disc 3. The studio split the 101 minute 36 sec ""making of"" documentary directed by Laurent Bouzerau into 3 parts, one part on each disc.  Not very convenient but at least its the same documentary, same length, as was on the 1998/2001 ""Collector's Edition"" DVD. The two trailers from that earlier release are here although the 1977 trailer here is called Original Theatrical Preview and is 1:20 longer (for this one they add 1:20 footage up front from the air traffic controllers scene; almost sounds as if the narrator is different, see what you think).  The Special Edition trailer is the same as on the Collector's Edition DVD.  The 1977 ""Watch the Skies"" featurette has also been released here on the 30th Anniversary Edition as well.  What's totally new here is a newly-filmed conversation with Spielberg called ""Steven Spielberg: 30 Years of Close Encounters"" running 21:21; and a 2 minute 30th Anniversary release trailer.  One of the coolest things of all is a 14""x21"" glossy poster with a complete guide to the 3 versions (edits) of the film indicating which scenes are unique to each version and which scenes were trimmed, added, excised, etc. laid out in a ""timeline"" (of the 2 hour+ running time) fashion.  Finally CE3K fans can get straight which scenes were in which version after all these years! The reverse side of the poster is the 1977 movie poster.  There is also a really nice booklet (lots of pages) with production stills and filmography information on Spielberg and the 4 main stars.  The only thing not included here that was on the Collector's Edition DVD are the 11 deleted scenes totalling 24:17 - so between that release and this, you should have pretty much all you need! (The 1990 Criterion laserdisc material would be great to have as well, but it's not a perfect world - this set and the Collector's set together make this fan completely happy!)

10204,5,076780192X,"Close Encounters of the Third Kind remains at the top of my list of my all time favorite movies. It has invoked a sense of wonder that no movie has ever come close to. And now that we have the 30th anniversary edition on DVD, we finally get to experience the movie in the original release as well as the two other cuts.

The movie involves the government searching for UFO evidence and the everyday people who see the UFO's who didn't go seeking them. While the government searches merely on scientific facts to make contact, the ""everyman"" characters develop an artistic talent either through art or music to lead them to contact. Those two sides finally clash before both making contact and realizing how they came together and how they were all ""invited"" to make contact.

I think what makes this movie so special for me is how little you see of the UFO's during the entire movie and how it affects the characters throughout the film. Then we are rewarded with the best final 20 minutes of any film made since. And the music...not just the ""5 notes"" but the entire soundtrack by John Williams is so haunting and is a character in itself.

Having the original edition again is a thrill and I believe I have to give it the edge, though the ""Director's Cut"" is a very close second. The Director's Cut has the better Neary introduction but everything else I like better in the original cut. Don't ask me why, but the pillow scene was always a haunting scene and I liked it. And I like the order of the scenes between Roy and the government officials better. Though, as a whole, the director's cut isn't bad at all, I just like the original. When I was younger, I was thrilled to hear about the Special Edition to see ""inside the mothership."" And as a kid, I loved those scenes but was so unhappy that the building of Roy's Devil's Tower was left out and as a result, it ruined the movie for me. Now, I am glad the mothership inside scene was removed from the Director's Cut as it does take away the sense of wonder if what it would be like from our minds.

Close Encounters has stood the test of time and it is a film that always will and could never be remade.",1195084800,23,2160,4.365671641791045
10205,5,076780192X,"Now this is the way it should be. You get all three cuts, all remastered in 5.1 surround and all have been digitally transferred. Thank you so much Mr. Spielberg because this without a doubt has to be one of your best (along with the original ET).

Last night, I watched the original theatrical version and forgot how much was removed for the ""Special Editions"" and the final ""Director's Cut"". In my mind, the original version is the best and to finally have it in all it's uncut 5.1 surround sound (which didn't exist back then) glory is simply wonderful.

The packaging is nice, although I found it very difficult to remove the DVDs without fearing I might snap them because the locking mechanism seems to not want to let go of the DVDs no matter how hard I press down on them. I suppose I could look at it in that I shouldn't fear them coming off during shipping and getting scratched up.

The box is nicely designed and inside are some wonderful items. It comes with a poster that gives a time line for each movie and where each cut differs which I found really interesting. It also comes with a book full of bios on the actors and other people that worked on the film. Plenty of in-movie and behind-the-scene shots. Finally, the three DVDs are housed in a tri-fold container. Inside and outside are colorful shots from the movies and it really makes the entire set look nice.

In addition to the three editions of the movies, there is also a new ""30 Years"" documentary looking back over time at how CE has been a favorite movie that has stood the test of time. Also, the making-of documentary that was on the original Director's Edition that came out a few years ago has been split across the three DVDs. Also included is the 1977 making of documentary which was also on the previously released Director's Cut DVD.

Missing are all the ""deleted"" scenes that were included on the Director's Cut. So, if you own that one, it might be best to keep it since they are absent from this edition.

Overall, this is an excellent release and no one should be without it. To finally watch it like I did when it first came out back in 1977 (and I lived in Muncie, Indiana at that time so you can just imagine what the crowd did when that came up during the movie) was so refreshing and wonderful that I can't wait to watch it again!",1195084800,209,2325,4.395348837209302

10214,5,076780192X,"Okay, I really don't get how this price is ridiculous.  For a few reasons.  Here are mine.

1. Spider-Man 3 is $50 retail, same as this.  One version of it, too.  And most people didn't even think that movie was all that great.

2. Blade Runner is ridiculously UNDER-priced.  Think about it.  A typical Blu-Ray release is around $20 if you get it through amazon and at least $25-$30 if you get it at a department store like Best Buy.  Blade Runner is a FIVE disc set for $40 retail and $27.95 on amazon??  That is, hands down, the best deal I have ever seen on home video.  Period.  But don't let it screw the curve for Close Encounters.

3. You're getting THREE versions of the film, two of which have never been on DVD, none of which have been on Blu-Ray.  And plenty of extras.  And it's a classic, classic film (unlike Spider-Man).  Well worth my $35.  In any case, this release is ten times as awesome as the typical Blu-Ray release by the looks of it...and only about $5 more than I'd pay for another one at Best Buy.  I think it's perfectly reasonable myself.",1191024000,19,1066,4.324873096446701

This is one that could be enjoyed even by those who hate science fiction films.  The plot is amazing and, in my opinion, this film needs to be regarded as the standard setting sci-fi film of the 70's, just as 2001: A Space Odyssey was in the 60's.  Also, the acting was just astounding, especially on the part of Richard Dreyfus.

In conclusion I wanted to add in response to the reviewer below that it is more like good riddance to a witch of a wife.  Teri Garr did a splendid job of playing a wife who's head was completely in the sand and was not supportive of her husband at all.  I mean, if I had a loser wife like this, then I would be really tempted, alien encounter or not, to trash my living room and build a replica of Devil's Tower in my living room so she would think I was crazy and would leave me... FOR GOOD!!  Or, better yet, have the aliens abduct her, harvest her organs so they could see what a LOUSY EARTHLING WIFE IS MADE OF!!

Close Encounters Of The Third Kind is the journey of Roy Neary. Roy Neary is a dreamer, stuck in the mundane craziness of everyday life. One night Roy sees something that changes his life, he has a Close Encounter with something unexplainable.

Roy's life goes into an tailspin. He loses many things that are dear to him in his search for truth, his curiosity becomes an obsession. Roy begins to see the shape of a mountain in pillows, in shaving cream, and seems to be falling apart at the seams.

This Close Encounter has changed Roy Neary's life, and that of those who are featured along his journey. This film has stood the test of time for thirty years, and is a testament to the talent of Steven Spielberg.

This film, along with Star Wars revolutionized not only special effects but blockbusters in general. I've never seen another film that weaves both music and special effects so beautifully.

Steven Spielberg really messed up this time around, making a movie about space and yet most of it takes place on earth.  Duh...what kind of science fiction movie takes place on Earth in the 1970s?  This one, I guess.

If you like to see movies about Richard Dreyfus playing with carbs, then you'll love Close Encounters.  And special effects?  I don't know why they're considered so revolutionary because they're not half as good as anything I saw in ID4 (that's what I call Independence Day) or MIB II (Men in Black II) or iRobot or even Wild Wild West.  Apparently in Steven Spielberg's mind all space aliens are going to terrorize our planet after they arrive in a big Simon (complete with flashing colored lights and the annoying four musical notes)

I have rediscovered it now, thanks to DVD, and am kicking myself for not getting better acquainted with it after all these years. It isn't a stretch to say that Close Encounters may be the best Alien movie. Spielberg also wrote the film(and why hasn't he written a truckload more?), and it's a wonderful accomplishment still after 30 years. The great Richard Dreyfuss stars as Roy Neery, a middle class, suburban husband and father who has a 'close encounter' when UFO's begin to come into his town of Muncie, Indiana. And what a great scene that is!. Roy and a few others, including single mom Melinda Dillon(A Christmas Story), end up with a connection to the UFO's as the aliens inside try to make contact with earthlings. Spielberg has a great sense of feeling and wonder thru the entire film. He shows us how this could be taken in two ways. One, he gives us the whimsical, fantastical, awe-inspiring side, and with a fantastic sequence in Dillon's house with her son, also gives us how this can be frightening and scary. One look at that scene and you can see how this movie heavily influenced Shyamalan's ""Signs"". The movie was made 30 years ago, but it holds up strongly. It's 30 year old story and effects are more affective than a lot of the films today with millions of dollars and fancy new technology. Dreyfuss is always good, and he's great here as Neery. Teri Garr plays his wife. The home life aspect of the fillm doesn't work for some, but it's part of what made the movie to me. Seeing how this normal, average joe gets sucked up in this obsession and how it starts to affect the family life. Garr doesn't get a whole lot here, but she seems to get across that she is a woman who doesn't know what to do. The late director Francois Truffaut plays a scientist, along with Bob Balaban, tracking the UFO's and the strange occurences that have happened around the world. The score by Spielberg mainstay, John Williams, is another success in his long cannon of work. Beautiful and haunting, and who will forget those few chords?. The end is still remarkably fresh and amazing, and the mother ship itself is more cool and impressive than a lot of what we can see nowadays in movies. It's grand entrance is still amazing and a great accomplishment in filmmaking. The smaller ships that come and go are equally fun and well done. Close Encounters has a lot of great things going for it. There are a number of great/classic scenes, a wonderful score, good acting, and a sense of awe and wonder that Spielberg is so brilliant at capturing. You gotta love early, 1975-82, Spielberg. The fact that this movie remains to be so good and touching and amazing 30 years on and before all the studio money that goes out nowadays is a testament to the film and Spielberg's talents. A true classic.",1178496000,2,2906,4.547709923664122
10254,5,076780192X,"On its thirtieth anniversary, Steven Spielberg's UFO masterpiece, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), seems as fresh and wondrous as a child's birthday present.  UFO's appear in the night skies over Indiana and kidnap little Cary Guffey.  His poor mom, Melinda Dillon, has no idea that the aliens are friendly.  Richard Dreyfuss sees the sightings also and all but ignores wife Teri Garr to follow them all over Indiana in a truck.  After Dreyfuss makes a giant mountain of earth in his living room without knowing why, Garr takes their son and leaves him.  But he's too busy trying to figure out what obsesses him about the mountain.

Then Dreyfuss and Dillon realize at the same time what the mountain means--Devil's Tower in Wyoming.  But what is the mystery of Devil's Tower?  Pretty soon they are joining forces by truck to head for Wyoming.  What compels their journey?  I'm not even sure Spielberg, as writer and director, knows.  Over thirty years, he has re-edited his movie at least three times--from 135 minutes, to 132 minutes, to a Director's Cut of 137 minutes that leaves out several scenes I remember, including the inside of the space ship at the film's finale.  Anyway, our intrepid duo reach Devil's Tower.  Ironically, the Army arrest them as aliens!

The last third of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, secretly filmed in an Alabama warehouse, has some of the most spectacular visual effects in movie history and won Vilmos Zsigmond a Cinematography Oscar for his brilliant work, in tandem with at least five other cinematographers all over the world, including Douglas Slocombe in northern India.  (The great Douglas Trumbull gets Visual Effects credit, along with Spielberg.)  Legendary French filmmaker Francois Truffaut has a nice supporting role as a French scientist who initially wants to know what Dreyfuss knows.  But he turns out benign.  This was one of the first mainstream Hollywood movies to treat extra-terrestrials sympathetically.  (Spielberg's E.T. was still five years in the future.)  And it is still one of the best ever, helped immeasurably by John Williams' ethereal score and an innate intelligence toward UFOs.  Young Guffey's final scene is particularly lovely as he waves goodbye to the departing spaceship.

I still wish Spielberg had kept in the scene he replaced in the 1980's for TV where we go inside the spaceship at the end.  But my Mom thinks it is more satisfying to let us wonder what the interior is like and who is inside.  Judge Crater?  Lee Harvey Oswald?  Marilyn Monroe?  I still fondly remember ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" from PINOCCHIO playing inside, but maybe my Mom is right on Spielberg's decision.  He and longtime editor Michael Kahn (still his editor of choice) seem to have imperceptibly improved the middle of a long 137 minute movie.

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is magnificent filmmaking that holds up beautifully after thirty years.  Though his SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) are mature adult works of art, Spielberg still has no equals for creating great popular movie entertainment for kids of all ages--like the INDIANA JONES trilogy.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is worth another look if you have not seen it in a while.

I am reviewing a $10 drugstore DVD with no bonuses, but restored color, THX sound, and letterboxing for Panavision.  You might want to spend more and get the two disk set with bonuses on how the astonishing UFO's were created.",1178150400,4,3442,4.971978984238179
10255,5,076780192X,"Though, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was made thirty years ago, it has a wonderful, fresh, timeless quality that keeps you intrigued and entertained.  Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a father and husband, is forever changed upon experiencing a close encounter with beings from another planet, during a blackout, while in his truck, on his way to repair multiple electrical outages in his town.  Roy is changed, after having this experience, and it totally turns his life on its head in his process to really understand what he encountered in the darkness, that evening.  His wife, Romie (Teri Garr) and children cannot comprehend this sudden change in Roy, as he is driven to more and more unusual behavior, as the story progresses.  Roy encounters Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) and her son, Barry (Cary Guffey), who also experienced a brush with this supernatural encounter.  They are brought together by their experience, and are also divided from those around them who have not witnessed the arrival of the mysterous, night-dwelling spaceships, and the bright lights that announce their arrival.

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS deals with some very well-executed themes.  They include the concept of life, existing on the planets beyond our Earth and the possibility that some people really are destined to explore life beyond the constraints of the world that we know.  Also, Richard Dreyfuss' character is representative of the dreamer that exists in all of us, before the world shuts down our feelings of possibility.

What's more, this duel disc collector's edition of the film includes bonus footage that was left out of the extended version of the film, as well as a documentary that takes a closer look at the special effects and great effots that went into bringing the story to the screen.

10270,5,076780192X,"Almost everything is enlightening, especially on repeated viewings, in Steven Spielberg's best movie (IMHO).  And there seems not a wasted frame (even in cut/uncut/recut DVD extras) involved in this, a strange, wonderful SCI-FI/FANTASY film that blurs the lines joyfully between the two genres.

On one hand, CE3K is based upon just enough facts and evidence (with credibility) about the UFO/ET phenomenom (continuing to present day) to effectively suspend disbelief in the audience, but is filled with amazing and eye candy CGI special effects to realize that vision of those crazies who have been contacted.  And those who have yet not.  Except for the original Apocalypse Now (not the crappy and detracting ""redux""), this is almost a ""perfect film"" in every way.  Especially for ""Hollyweird.""  Shame this had to come in the same year as the original ""Star Wars.""  As well as other great films.

Roy Neary is the everyman.  Just an ordinary American schlmoe in a small town, an electric power county repairman, who one unexpected night, called out on an emergency power blackout, is encountered on a dark, quiet, star-filled night sky, by something very strange, and beings far beyond his understanding.

His truck is ""explored"" by a brightly lit UFO, turning his vehicle suddenly anti-gravity, and sunburning one side of his face as he tried to look up at the ET craft, in a truck whose electronic systems and radio have all gone haywire and dark.

Everyman Neary (Richard Dryefuss) sees a lot of other amazingly colorful and special, special effects shortly after his first encounter, but with a non-understanding wife (Teri Garr), his personal life falling apart because he just can't get over WHAT HE EXPERIENCED (despite official government denials) and becomes obsessed with it, Roy hooks up with Jillian (Melinda Dillon) who shared Neary's experiences, and whose young boy was apparently abducted by the ufo's and E.T.

Unlike Spielberg's later (more successful financially but much less so artistically) ""ET: The Extraterrestrial,"" Close Encounters captures the awe and wonder at the confrontation of the unknown and frighteningly unexplored.  While in ET, most of what is presented is childlike and revealed, in CE3K (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), the genius of Spielberg is more fully realized and more rewardingly subtle.  Maybe Steve was just uncorrupted by the Hollywood system, but while I like ET, Close Encounters is presented as a mystery in the most cosmic sense.  A normal American joe encounters the extraordinary.  How will he resolve this?  And what wonders await?

I have always had a problem with the various versions and releases/edits of this film.  Even with deleted scenes and unseen ones however, there really is no ""filler"" here.  This was and is, Hollywood SCI-FI/FANTASY filmmaking at its best, along with George Lucas and his efforts of course.

I envy those who have never experienced this movie.  I've seen it (in all its forms) more than any other film (save perhaps Apocalypse Now in its two forms), and there are parts I still MUST watch, whenever it appears on the tube.  It is a movie of mystery and frustration, of identification with the characters and that sense of wonder of exploring the unknown, and while Spielberg's ""ET"" might've been a compelling exploration of that quest to understand the wonderous unknown, this movie is even more compelling.  And appeals not to the child, but to the child within all of us, so called ""adults.""

""Even if there ain't no such thing,"" Roy Neary said.

The story is believable, the characters are all of us in a way, the special effects are spectacular, the wonder of it all is evident in almost every frame, the music is second to none, and this was, and remains Steven Spielberg's finest achievement.",1167091200,6,3794,5.059485530546624

The title of this movie is actually one of the classifications used to classify the reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).  A six-fold classification was developed in the late 1950s:

(1) Nocturnal lights: bright lights seen at night.
(2) Daylight disks: usually oval or disk-like.
(3) Radar visual: visual sightings detected by radar.
(4) Close encounters of the first kind: visual sightings of an UFO.
(5) Close encounters of the second kind:  visual sightings plus physical effects on animate or inanimate objects.
(6) ** Close encounters of the third kind: sightings of occupants in or around the UFO.

There is also another category not on this list:

Close encounters of the fourth kind: actual physical contact with the occupants of UFOs is made.

The movie was written and directed by Steven Spielberg.  He explains his movie:

""I wanted to make a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with his experience.""

This movie focuses on three main characters:

(1) Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss):  He is an everyday kind of guy that has a materialistic wife (Teri Garr) and three children.  He has an experience that makes him obsessed with aliens.  (This is the person Spielberg is talking about above.)

(2) Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon, who earned a supporting actress nomination):  She is a single mother whose young son, Barry (Cary Guffey), was abducted by an alien spacecraft.  She thus also becomes obsessed with aliens.

(3) Claude Lacombe (played by the great French moviemaker Francois Truffaut):  This character is based on a real-life UFO expert.  Lacombe is a U.N. scientist who is in-charge of a mostly American team investigating unexplained phenomenon on Earth.

All three of these characters meet and experience (with others) an extraordinary event--First Contact.

Note that this movie, as can be deduced from its title, focuses on an encounter of the third kind but encounters of other kinds do occur in this movie.

In my opinion, of all the actors, Richard Dreyfuss as the obsessed Roy Neary does an excellent job.

The genius of this movie is that we don't find out until the end whether the aliens are hostile or not.

The special effects are remarkable for the time especially at the end.  Actually much of this movie does not have major special effects until its end where the fantastic effects easily stand up to those of today.  This brings up another point: this is an intelligent sci-fi movie where the special effects have a purpose and are not simply used for display.

The background music is especially good.  It garnered an Academy Award nomination.

This movie in total had eight Academy Award nominations and one win for Best Cinematography.

The only problem I had with the story is that it seems to drag a bit during its middle scenes.

Finally, the DVD (collector's edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a few extras, all of which are interesting.

In conclusion, if you want to see what it feels like to experience First Contact, then I strongly recommend viewing this captivating movie!!!

10290,5,076780192X,"I was utterly rivetted by this film when I saw it in '77.  It had no shoot'em up alien stuff, but instead is an extremely subtle exploration of first open contact with alien explorers.  THere is a lot of humor and mystery in it, unexplained things that come together in the end in a wonderful and optimistic climax.  I found it a powerful emotional experience then, and seeing it nearly 30years later - with my kids, who were also fully engaged in the mystery and mood of it - equally satisfying (ok, a bit slow at time for them as they are used to star wars action and pace).  Indeed, this is one of the best sci-fi films I have ever seen.

But at the heart of the story is the young Richard Dreyfus.  I think this is one of his greatest performances, which is really saying something given his qualities as an actor.  Here, he is a normal guy who becomes an extraordinary person:  while he lacks the education and experience of those who are similarly smitten with close encounters of the 3rd kind, he rises above them all in an earthy way that shows the qualities within him that no one, not even himself, knew he had.  It is really a subtle transformation,  a new kind of film experience in my view.  His crazy behavior in the beginning is revealed later as an almost spiritual journey to which he was ""invited.""

One of the funnest thing about this film is how many things go unexplained.  That means a lot of it remains under the surface, where answers are implied but never made explicit.  Why now?  What were the aliens looking for?  Why was Dreyfus ""invited""?  (Did they see something in him?  Were they testing similar people?  Why didn't his friend feel ready to go as well?)  If you are so inclined, these questions can ignite your imagination as the best sci-fi can.

Warmly recommended.  This is a masterpiece of off-the-beaten track sci-fi.",1138147200,,1855,4.491017964071856

This movie is one of my all time favorites becuase I have this thought running around which says 'it could have/could be happening'. This possibility and the gentle emotion throughout makes me on the edge of my seat even after my fifth or sixth time watching.

I can't watch it every day like I can with some movies but I do watch it about once every two years or so. This is a classic up there with Batteries not Included and I really wish there was a sequal.

The only thing which I wonder about is: Is Taken a follow on from this movie? It sure seems like it.

Otherwise I have no complaints and love the funny obsessions and determination of the main charaters to see for themselves. You can really imagine it happening that's why I love it.",1137110400,,869,4.154761904761905

I have to admit, I really fell in love with it.  It's nowhere near as dazzling as the special effects produced today, but it is still quite good.  The visuals are still amazing, despite how old the technology for it is.

If you like sci-fi stuff, and haven't seen this, do so.  Maybe it's not as good as star wars, but it's still good.",1130976000,2,468,4.087912087912088
10305,3,076780192X,"I bought the very same product on VHS tape (in widescreen).

I had hoped that this would truly make it an enhanced viewing experience, since it was on DVD.

Yes, it comes in a 2-DVD package, although the container itself is stupid to say the least. A flip-flop tray that has to be pulled out of a sleeve.

The second DVD doesn't offer much more, than the specials already included at the end of the videotape.

Granted, the sound is a bit better than its VHS counterpart, but was it worth it? NO!

Let me just compare it with the ""LEGEND - Special Edition"" 2-DVD release.

What did you get in that one?

First of all, since there were two versions of the ""LEGEND"" movie (a Europen/International and a U.S. version), you got them both.

Same feature was included in the ""ALIEN"" superbox, in which one got the theatrical releases and the special/director's cuts, back to back and in the ""X-MEN"" superbox, in which you can easily ""reintegrate"" the cut scenes of the theatrical versions with a push on your remote control.

Here you just receive Steven Spielberg's original vision and the cut/additional scenes are left to a special by itself, included in DVD 2.

The special contents are the very same as the ones included, as said earlier, at the end of the tape.

The interview with Spielberg is tedious and disenchanting. A man consumed by too much success speaks out and seems almost bored with what seems to have been his masterpiece of all times.

A man that has lost his original vision and is disenchanted with his own ideals of yesteryear is not very interesting at all. He's just old.

To impose it then to his ""fans???"" is stupid to say the least.

Maybe he is tired, maybe he is just plainly being sarcastic, or so I hope, 'cause if it is what the man truly feels about producing and directing his own movies (and having an extreme amount of luck in being able to do so at all, while many never get a chance in their lifetimes), seems like a slap in the face to those who have admired his work and his talent.

I, having watched the interview felt personally offended by his reviewed vision of things. Maybe I lack the ""maturity???"" he has achieved?

Nevertheless, I bought this, let me say, junk of a movie.

I even attributed it 3 stars in memory of the old glory it represented, when I first went to a movie theatre to watch it.

It hasn't improved one bit, being transferred onto DVD.

It just sits there, in my shelf, gathering dust.

I wanted to buy ""E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial"" Special Edition, but having seen this, I suspect it's the same-o, same-o as the Laser Disc version I already have and the special VHS widescreen tape I bought some years ago.

Nor am I enthused to have, as a special, the score conducted live by John Williams either. I'll rather wait until the ""live"" score will appear on audio CD one day, and then again, the question will still remain, will I still be interested in anything Steven Spielberg did?

As said, the decision to include such a disillusioned interview with Spielberg on a movie I have learned to cherish for years, made me think, and when I think, it is not usually a good thing.

I sometimes wonder whether this movie was made out of passion or plain and simply with a taste for money in mind.

These are things that irritate me immensely. It is as if Shakespeare would have put down all the works he had written and had considered them plain ""youth junk"".

Sorry Mr. Spielberg, a man that loses faith in his own visions, after having founded a family or not, has either been badly burned by life (which doesn't really seem to be the case with you), or he is plainly tired of his life as it is, in which case my honest suggestion would be, to change activity altogether and allow somebody else ready to carry your burden to emerge.

I have always detested winers, especially when they have reached the top and had so much luck with it.

Please take a moment and think about it, Mr. Spielberg.

Who made you what you are?

The Studios? The Executives? The Backers?

Or we, the audience?

Think, and think hard!

Sorry, I cannot recommend this product and unless somebody with more inventiveness and loyalty toward the audience will dish up both versions (in their entirety), with more uplifting and more interesting specials, I don't see why anyone would do himself so much harm as to waste his/her money in a clever ""rehash"" of the very same product.

By the way, since I am already at it. Please studios, distributors, directors and producers, do us all a big, immense favor.

Stop reissuing the same products in a dozen of different packagings, when the product itself is always the same.

It's a waste of time, talent, taste, money and a complete lack of true intelligence, creativity and intuitiveness.

I can only suppose that you are all better than that, so why don't you push yourselves harder to finally give us, the audience, better and more thoroughly thought of products?

You only stand to gain from it.

Just remember what Abraham Lincoln said:

""You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.""

A bit of respect to those who buy your products should be in order.

Do not ever dare assume that the masses are only formed by illiterate and uncouth people.

Unfortunately for you, there are also people out there able to scrutinize and judge you by your deeds.

There are even some, able to read between the lines.

So, please, become a bit wiser and show us that we are not just buyers, but rather chosers of your fate.

Yes, because ultimately it is us, the customers, who decide whether you have another day in business or not, not your fancy peers, nor your elegant, Armani clad, shareholders.

Keep that in mind, and you will be in business forever.

Forget it, and your life may be drastically changed by the twists of fate, and as we all know, fate cannot be influenced by one man alone.

This is it.

Buy it, my fellow customers, if you feel you have money to throw to the dogs. Refrain, if every penny is dear to you.

There are far better movies around.

This is just an old myth and getting older by the minute.",1127692800,7,6178,4.486123545210385
10306,5,076780192X,"Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is sent out on an emergency repair job late one night. While traveling alone on an isolated road he encounters the unexpected, an unidentified flying object is spotted overhead. The object also sees him, shining a bright light on his vehicle which causes a sunburn effect to appear on his face the next morning.

However Roy soon discovers he has received more than just a sunburn during the strange proceedings of the previous night. An idea, or impulse has overcome him and he isn't sure what it all means. He only knows ""it's important.""

Soon his strange behavior and obsession with the experience results in his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) and three children packing up and moving out. Undetered by their absence Roy continues on with his quest to discover what he's supposed to do. Roy finds the answer when he looks upon the image of a monolithic rock formation in Wyoming known as the ""Devil's Tower."" The only question that remains is can he get there in time to greet the ship when it arrives?

An ingenious blending of twentieth century UFO lore with overt Christian symbology and a religious-like fervor makes Steven Spielberg's '77 sci-fi classic more relevant today than ever.

Another amazing acting job by Richard Dreyfuss along with a surprisingly good supporting role by the legendary French director Francois Truffaut and the adorable little Cary Guffey as ""Barry!""",1126483200,3,1409,4.9576271186440675
10307,5,076780192X,"This still rates as one of Spielberg's best films. Richard Dreyfuss is at his best here as a man being drawn toward the unknown. The special effects were top notch for their day and still hold up well. There are scenes in this movie, such as the scene in which Dreyfuss is in his car and the UFO lights up his car and the mailboxes are rattling, that just knock you on your a## in suspense. The film is directed beautifully and the story told dramatically. This film is a masterpiece in film history and always will be. Spielberg was hitting his stride at this point, Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Close Encounters, E.T. are all great films in their own right.

The director's edition restores some scenes that were omitted when the special edition was released in 1980, and deletes the ""inside the mother ship"" scene, which I always felt was overkill.

On a more personal note...in the days following September 11, 2001, this was the film I finally came upon on TV after all those horrifying hours of 9-11 images.  As I watched, I was suddenly 10 years-old again, seeing the movie for the first time at the Ziegfeld Theater in NYC.  It didn't seem to matter that I had the uncut, unedited VHS tape on the shelf in front of me, I just kept watching it to the end.

10309,5,076780192X,"Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a great example of a film doing away with conventions and making a compelling and even magical film that you can't imagine being made today. When it comes down to my top 5 favorite films ever, this tends to interchange with E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. Whereas that film is still touching and more emotional, Close Encounters is filled with a visual splendor where the images are made to show us the wonder of things that can happen. Despite Spielberg's claim that it's the one film that ""dates"" him, it's still arguably one of his best, even in light of Schindler's List or Jaws.

Roy Neery is a blue-collar family man who, while on the job, has a strange encounter with a craft with bright lights in the sky. The experience ends up changing him and pretty soon he becomes obsessed with it and one particular image which causes much trouble with his wife and kids. Elsewhere, a frenchman named Mr. Lacombe and his interpreter Laughlin are finding strange things around the world such as planes and ships in the desert and a curious 5 note melody. All of this ends up tying together in the end as everyone discovers something life changing.

In the days of Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, one thing that was never lost on Spielberg was making even mundane scenes interesting. From radio traffic controllers encountering something strange to Lacombe showing the famous hand signals matching the musical notes, nothing in this film seems wasted. Which of course makes the completely memorable images all the more striking such as Roy's truck going haywire, mother Jillian getting unwelcome visitors in her house to seeing just how massive the final ship is compared to the mountain, this film never feels like it just lags.

One of the great things about Spielberg is that he actually explains why he shoots a scene a certain way or how he came up with a particular shot. Most directors go ""well...thought it would be cool"" but as he says in the excellent documentary on the making of the film; sure the mothership coming up from behind the mountain instead of the sky doesn't make any sense but it's an awesome image so who cares if it's not realistic. Included with the set is deleted scenes that didn't make the cut including the fate of the police officer who chased, (and flew over a ditch), one of the UFO's as well as the interior of the mothership with Spielberg being right saying it should've been a mystery.

Is it as exciting and popcorn fun as Jaws? Or as serious and character driven as Schindler's List? Well no but that's beside the point since this is a film where you're almost glad something that feels this against the grain exists.",1121817600,,2690,4.656842105263158

Dreyfuss is good, but a little to strong in his character. Melinda Dillon as the single mother who loses her son to the aliens is brilliant, so is Teri Garr. This film makes you think, can the government actually pull this off?...After seeing this, I believe it. The DTS version is incredible, the scene where Barry,(little boy), is abducted, is just out right crazy and loud.
  Dreyfuss,(a man on a mission), has had a close encounter, is out to find out where and why. Believe me, if this was you, you would have sleepless nights. Dialogue is good, FX, is incredible for 1977, and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC. Spielberg's 3rd feature film is a breakthrough, and one mans drive and vision of his childhood dreams.

They terrorise a mother to within an inch of her life, pulling her child out of her own arms leaving her distraught and not knowing whether he is alive or dead. Why did they do that when they had dozens of adult abductees that had perfectly useful mature brains for study? Nasty aliens. And what about those adult abductees? Second World War guys, torn from wives or girlfriends. True love gone forever. Their parents probably dead in the interim. On top of that trauma they now have to adjust to a new world where they don't fit in. The result: depression and alcoholism, maybe even suicide. Nasty, nasty aliens. Then to cap it all off they come out of their mother ship naked and expose themselves to the reception committee. Sexual assault can be extremely traumatic, resulting in long term psychological problems. Except the French guy who no doubt treats that sort of thing with a Gallic shrug.

How many people doesn't still look to the sky for answers of the great unknown that's above us for sure, the universe is there serving us with its' giantness and all that yet undiscovered out there making our imagination go wild -and that's what makes this movie as facinating as it still is today!

The wondeful Richard Dreyfuss in the lead, of course it is well acted -from most of the actors at least. The locations, somewhere in Montana (?) -perfect. Beautiful pictures of the nightsky, fantastic spaceship(s), the movie is sometimes witty, sometimes sad and gripping -the story being as complex yet as simple as it is. It's the story of a family falling apart, and a story of serial of un-explainable events witnessed by a father (Dreyfuss) that drives him to do things that makes it look as if he is going insane, he becomes obsessed. And much more to that of course.

I have no idea which version I have seen, could they not just release the extended version once and for all? That is the only stupid thing about this movie, or perhaps its' makers that is.

Close Encounters is very slow moving, with the occassional interesting thing occurring, but it is not until the end where something interesting happens.  And even then, I expected more.  I was left thinking ""is that it, after all that slow build-up?"".  Many scenes during the film are just too stupid for words.

I have viewed the 2-Disc collector's edition which apparently is a combination of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version. For a first timer to the film, it made no difference to me. However, as fans of the film have stated, the tampering by Spielberg for this special edition was not appreciated.  He re-edited the original version removing scenes that perhaps gave it its popularity (eg. Dreyfuss entering the mothership).  Spielberg has said he will never re-instate these scenes. Doesn't it annoy you when a Director refuses to let people see a film the way they originally remember?  It's almost a kick in the teeth for helping him make his millions.  Oh well, at least he had the decency to allow the original 'untouched' version of E.T. to be included on the 2002 digitally enhanced version DVD.

The second disc of CE3K contains the extras which I guess would be gold for fans of the film. The DVD overall is a limited edition and at a price too - I am surprised at the price considering the film isn't that great.

 Definitely a film that should be seen in the movie theater.  Perhaps it should be re-released again.
The best science-fiction film ever made. Every child and adult should see it.

  Rod Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is married to Ronnie (Teri Garr).  They have three children, Brad (Shawn Bishop), Justin (Toby Dreyfuss [yes, his nephew] and Silvia (Adrienne Campbell).  He is a good father, sometimes stressed out, but he is also a sensitive man.  One night, he gets an emergency call from his work. Being an electrical lineman, he has to go out. He drives to a rural area near Muncie, Indiana and stops at a railroad crossing.  This moment is about to change him.  He continues to have visions of something, but he does not know what it is yet.
  In Muncie, Indiana, there is a mother, Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) who raises her 3-year old young son, Barry (Cary Guffey).  There is some kind of storm brewing over. The boy wakes up and suddenly the toys come on and the vacuum runs around. The kitchen is a mess. The boy runs outside laughing and playing. Jillian runs after him and climbs up a roadside. Barry stands in the middle of the road and almost gets hit by Rod's truck, but Jillian is quick to get her boy off the road and so was Rod quick enough to stop the truck.  Then, several UFO's fly above them. That is just the beginning.

Also in the cast: Bob Balaban, Francois Truffaut, Roberts Blossom, George DiCenzo, Howard K. Smith, Carl Weathers, J. Patrick McNamara, Lance Henriksen.
That is Susan Seaforth Hayes and Bill Hayes in a real television clip from Days of Our Lives (NBC). As of this writing, they are still on the serial together.

This version does not include the ""Special Edition"" ending made in 1980 for the re-issue of the film. However, the ""Special Edition"" new ending is seen in the Deleted Scenes on Disc 2.

  Disc Two includes a 1 hour and 41 minute documentary, ""The Making Of Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  Very interesting details about filming locations, casting, a deleted scene, and seven new scenes added into the 1980 re-issue called ""Special Edition: Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  Also on Disc Two, an over 4-minute theatrical trailer of the original film and a theatrical trailer for the ""Special Edition"" version.  An over 5-minute 1977 featurette of the original film.  Over 15 unseen deleted scenes not seen in the original and not the ""Special Edition"", except for the ""Special Edition"" ending which is shown.

  The original ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" was released in 1977.  It ran at 2 hours, 15 minutes.
  In 1980, Steven Spielberg re-worked the film cutting some scenes out and adding newly-filmed scenes with more of Richard Dreyfuss inside the Mothership.  It also included the song, ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" in end credits.
  For the ABC Network version in the 1980's, another version of the film was made.  It included the ""Special Edition"", but with ""all existing footage"" from the original film also added.  It ran at over 2 hours and 20 minutes.

  In 1998, Steven Spielberg again re-edited the film for a DVD ""Collector's Edition"".  It does not include the ""Special Edition"" ending of inside the Mothership with Richard Dreyfuss.  Running Time: 2 hours, 17 minutes.
2002 DVD release. Single Disc. Widescreen. No Special Features.

Option of Language: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Thai.
Option of Subtitles: English Dolby Surround, English Dolby Digital, English dts, French, Spanish.

All of us fans hope that some day soon, Steven Spielberg may release the ultimate longest version with the original footage and the ""special edition"" footage and the additional network television footage all together in the movie itself and release it on DVD.  A full-screen version (standard) would be nice too. (In December 2007, All versions of the film was released in a new ultimate DVD package).
  Subliminals: The top of the mothership made to look like an oil refinery with pipes and tubes, but subliminally to suggest scale like the New York City skyscrapers. The bottom of the ship like a huge breast, hence the name Mothership.
  In a tight shot as ship flies in (rock and Melinda Dillon on right), a little upside-down R2-D2 (Star Wars [1977]) is hanging to the left of three circle lights.
  The shapes in the shaving cream, the mud pack, the mashed potatoes are subliminal to what you will finally see.

Some people see this movie as the escape of the main character from the drudgery of life on earth. But I think they have missed the film completely.

Of the three versions of the film, I prefer the original. To explain why, let me begin simply by offering some snippets from the different edits, without explanation: In the original version, we are given a very meaningful cut going from a young child running after UFO's under the night sky, to the main character's music box playing, 'when you wish upon a star' from the Disney version of Pinocchio (instead of going to the main character's own kid bugging him about doing his homework for him, as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a meaningful cut going from the main character trying to explain what he saw to his wife, to his wife hiding newspaper clippings from her husband dealing with the same topic (instead of going to an old lost cargo ship somehow recently left in the desert of Mongolia, as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a seamless transition going from a team of scientists learning about a set of musical notes in India, to an attempt to translate them into hand signals, to an attempt to use them to contact the aliens by transmitting them by radio--to a young child successfully using the same notes on a toy xylophone.

The theme of this movie is about seeing the ordinary as extraordinary. It might also be called: ""Man, Machine and the Northern lights."" Or even, ""Pinocchio for Physics Majors."" Though ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" suits it well enough. First kind: sighting. Second kind: physical evidence. Third kind: contact. These terms were coined by Hynek to categorize reports of UFO's. Spielberg applies them in a way more down to earth. The ordinary things seen as extraordinary: technology, seen as part of nature, like the northern lights; human beings and relationships, seen as remarkable and unusual as alien encounters--or as wooden puppets become real boys. The hero portrays an ordinary man who is childlike and single hearted. In terms of categorization, the movie might best be characterized as a visual-musical fantasy, though strictly speaking it is of course science fiction. It is quite ingeniously directed and very beautifully choreographed. Superficially, it is about alien contact, but at a deeper level, it is a beautiful depiction of the limits (and limited validity) of a mechanical approach to life. In the end, it's more about human contact, than about alien contact.

The film consists of several sub-plots which gradually dovetail together. At the summit: The hero, Roy Neary, and a young boy, Barry Guiler, having kindred spirits, are, so to speak--through many trials and despite themselves--eventually brought together as family, one might even say providentially so. This family is contrasted to some vivid scenes of domestic life lived in narrow and petty way; the new family feels at home with itself while welcoming the most distant strangers: visitors from the stars. This openness is conveyed on the level of a child who is too innocent to even know the difference between an alien and a human; I would say, precisely, that it was Spielberg's main accomplishment in this film to convey it. Here Barry, a toddler, even steals the show--reportedly nicknamed by Spielberg as the ""one take"" kid! Though outwardly a movie about aliens, the visitors ultimately have, in this sense, the simple role of introducing the boy--and his widowed mom, Jillian--to the man (and very much from the point of view of the kid). It is, as it were, the antithesis of the premise for ""Lost in Space,"" of a family huddled together in an alien and hostile universe. If the child in you is dead, don't waste your time watching this film. If the adult in you is alive, be willing to see the film multiple times. It hangs together very well, but it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate it and see why.

Perhaps it even takes the multiple re-cuts. This film made a big impact on me when I first saw the original version; watching the re-cuts and analyzing why it had such an impact for me did go hand in hand. It is very interesting to now see side-by-side the three different versions of this film which Spielberg came out with reworking it over the years; I'm happy to have the three provided together in this anniversary DVD. The line from the film which I made into the title of this review--spoken by one of Neary's sons--was actually not in the original cut. But it summarizes the original just as well as it does the other two versions (the ""special edition"" and the subsequent, ""director's cut""), nonetheless. Spielberg followed his gut in this film, but he didn't check his brain at the door. Both have served him well. I see the original edition as the definitive one, and the two re-cuts as commentary and footnotes. Spielberg has referred to the director's cut as penultimate. I do not exclude the possibility of a new, ultimate version. Spielberg says that the original version suffered by being rushed due to studio pressures, and that the special edition was compromised by studio politics which required a ""peek inside the mothership."" The director's cut, it seems to me (and others), was compromised by being made-for-tv.  The original or theatrical version won an Oscar for cinematography.  The second two editions do provide insight (and unused footage) into Spielberg's original vision; but I think the original cut still remains the best overall version to date.

Two fascinating, very effective and related themes of the film are seeing the world as new, as if for the first time, and persevering aspirations to be faithful to truth amid being called into question by more conventional points of reference. Neary is led at points even to question his sanity himself; the audience is given enough reasons to question his sanity too (or at least fear for his losing it), though are also provided with enough clues to leave open a positive final verdict.  On the one hand, for example, Roy is not concerned merely with UFO sight-seeing (even with his family)--he speaks in a number of places where he sees an importance to what he saw and the sharing of it with authorities--; on the other hand, when team of Lacombe (an international professional UFO investigator) first learns of the coordinates of the mountain where the aliens are planning a major visit, they wind up needlessly trashing some furniture (an expensive globe belonging to the county supervisor)--in other words, just what bad decisions will normal people make under extraordinary circumstances? The scenes where Neary inadvertently acts crazy in front of the neighbors--to gather material for building a large scale model mountain in his living room--were taken out from the special edition and restored in the director's cut; perhaps Spielberg worried the scenes put too much of the blame for the marriage breakup on Neary (and no, it's not like Neary has no flaws).  In the special edition, in fact, Ronnie leaves the house before we see anything of the large scale mountain; we only see Neary carrying a garden hose and his youngest son protesting being taken by his mom into the car saying that 'dad needs some more help'--with the car then proceeding to nearly run Neary over--; the version underscores: Ronnie deserted Neary.  (Though a relevant line of Ronnie's is only found in the original version, where she flatly states, 'I am not getting a job,' just minutes after getting the news Roy lost his job with the power company, a fact for which she was partly to blame as she was careless and nonchalant in passing on some urgent phones messages, including from the governor.)  Neary first noticed the real mountain on TV (after building--and regretting having made--the large scale model), in a news story covering a concocted ""nerve gas"" scare, which he saw just seconds after his wife abruptly hung up him (amid a sincere effort on his part to reconcile).  Alot to take in, a bit of a roller coaster, even for the audience.  Was Neary alone to blame for his marital problems, or did the failure to communicate (with Ronnie early on even literally plugging her ears), give him too much for him to deal with at once?  Roy was actually fired in the wake of his having been sent (also underscored only in the original version) to investigate the cause of a power failure--which he found--it was UFOs.  Did Neary, nevertheless, then abandon his kids and fail to provide for them, or did he, at least from the point of his wife hanging up on him, only pursue the best--or even the only way--to make good, provide a fuller appreciation of what is real, even secure visitation rights (against accusations of insanity)?  (It is sometimes said that good stories don't tell us what to think, rather, they simply give us things to think about.)  In any event, what Neary sacrifices to build the models, unexpectedly losing his family in the process, becomes very meaningful when he draws on this experience to climb the real thing--expressly going against a government cover-up story which evacuated the area to keep lay spectators away. Very intense scene, like a double jeopardy--and he is still not sure what he is going to find (nor is the audience). Beautifully shot. The last half hour of the film deserves its reputation, but the rest of the film is far from filler; it does, however, set the stage.  I do think the mountain-climbing scene is helped by showing the prior havoc involved in building the large scale model mountain; I think Spielberg was right to restore it to the director's cut.  Neary's recklessness in building the mountain was over the top, but his enthusiasm seemed to stem from being convinced that he was finally going to be able to share what he experienced with his family, though he was tragically mistaken.

Roy is vindicated at the end of the film in his conviction of the importance of his sighting--an importance which ultimately boils down, it seems to me, as the needed supplement for the limitations in a mechanical approach to communication. The limitations here are very beautifully portrayed in the final sequences by a ""musical"" conversation with the aliens, based on a five-tone sequence which humans first heard coming from the UFOs in India. Anticipating the importance of making the most of this for future communication, Lacombe makes use of a system for teaching music to the deaf to associate hand signals with the notes, which he teaches to the members of his team on the fly (in a nearly empty university auditorium). The notes were successfully imitated by radio to get in response (through radio telescopes) the coordinates of the mountain; they were also successfully used to initiate a whole musical conversation at the mountain itself (with a man at a keyboard and the mothership responding). But the hand signals were very nearly a case of being dressed up with no place to go. Computers were analyzing said musical conversation as it took place, searching for mathematical patterns (I imagine against a database), which the humans were doing their best to go along with, not by improvising, but by music theory. The computer found a pattern, took over the conversation, but it turned out to be incomplete. The computer could no longer respond to the mothership's prompts. The people were stumped too. (I don't fault Spielberg here for not telling us the formula the computer matched against the music, and why it sounded like music. Ever listen to mathematically generated fractal music? Some of it isn't bad, actually.) The point here was plainly that it was time for face to face contact. Lacombe was ready with his hand signals, but the aliens weren't too interested in them. They come out of the ship just romping and playing; they were looking for Roy. (An alien eventually does use the signals to wave goodbye--or was it hello / see you later?--to Lacombe, who had before waved his arms in exasperation when the aliens delayed responding to the musical tones.) To me explicitly having the theme of body language in the film made perfect sense. While you can't paint a real smile, you can study the difference between a real one and a posed one: they actually involve different facial muscles, even different neurological pathways. Neary's participation was necessarily spontaneous, and Lacombe was wise enough to understand its importance even from a more mechanical perspective: In its scientific defense, he refers to it as a ""sociological event."" To put it another way: Lacombe was ""left-brained,"" Neary was ""right-brained,"" and the two approaches come together in the end to make a fully-blown encounter of the ""third kind"" with aliens who are ""whole brained.""

Neary and Barry do have the common failing of not being notably articulate. Neary even once quotes Barry in trying to describe the UFOs as ""like an ice-cream cone""--adding only that its flavor was ""orange"" (and this being an improvement over his first attempt: ""there was a red whoosh...""). He does improve considerably in comparing them to the aurora borealis, the northern lights--but only mispronouncing ""borealis."" Jillian, more sensitive to the interpersonal side of things, does a better job too--and betraying herself a kindred spirit--when she spontaneously calls the visits in the sky ""Halloween for grownups."" Eventually standing at the end of a line of volunteer astronauts arranged by Lacombe (and the only one not carrying a large duffle-bag), Neary is singled out and playfully caressed by the playmate friends which Barry had already made, solidifying, confirming and celebrating the new family bonds (the most moving moment of the film, with music from Neary's favorite movie, Pinocchio, playing spaced-style ala John Williams). On the whole a remarkable accomplishment, and a Spielberg masterpiece (both written and directed by him). Taking nothing away from ""alien contact,"" it still in its own way trumps it with a ""family reunion."" This theme was to recur in E.T., but there alien contact becomes tongue-in-cheek and all-too-familiar; one might even say that E.T. is ""CE3K for dummies."" Barry was no less interesting or precious than any alien; at one scene it is even made obvious that he looks a bit like his alien friends. The deep, personal contact of the kindred souls, even if visceral and inarticulate, is the real ""encounter."" It was this simultaneous solidifying of earthly and extraterrestrial bonds which was really the most striking thing about the film. After welcoming Neary, and just after ""waving"" to Lacombe, the alien takes a moment to gaze upon the human crowd with such an expression of wonder and amazement, it is breathtaking; another inspiring, moving and thoughtful scene--as if Spielberg were holding up a mirror to the human race. When Neary was caressed by Barry's playmates, they visibly did so with a sense of awe and amazement, a moment which moved Jillian to tears as she witnessed it herself; in a sense she sees Neary through the aliens' eyes. Yet why shouldn't aliens act that way? Why suppose that these imaginary beings of the story are more jaded than Barry, Jillian or Neary? Neary's virtue might be summarized by the simple fact that (as expressed in his own words, while once commenting on the UFOs), he 'didn't want to see this;' he was just someone open to truth and faithful to whatever he saw. He wanted to see Pinocchio with his kids. Are such attitudes really so unbelievable or trivial, or are they neither?

""To the child the tree and the lamp post are as natural and as artificial as each other; or rather, neither of them are natural but both supernatural, for both are splendid and unexplained. The flower with which God crowns the one, and the flame with which Sam the lamplighter crowns the other, are equally of the gold of Fairy Tales[...]In the middle of the wildest fields the most rustic child is, ten to one, playing at steam engines. And the only spiritual or philosophical objection to steam engines is not that men pay for them or work at them or make them very ugly or even that men are killed by them, but merely that men do not play at them[...]The evil is that the childish poetry of clockwork does not remain[...]The wrong is not that engines are too much admired, but that they are not admired enough[...]The sin is not that engines are mechanical, but that men are mechanical."" -G. K. Chesterton

CE3K is this passage put to film.

Some digressions with tidbits and trivia:

Unfortunately the digital transfer (both for DVD and for Blu-ray) was not entirely successful.  Excessive graininess in some of the scenes and particularly disappointing is some blurriness / halos around the special effects (all three problems for the landing of the mothership).  The UFOs in the original film actually enjoyed some degree of 'photo-realism;' they did *not* just appear as 'moving neon lights,' each a 'red whoosh' with no visible object (i.e., nothing reflecting ambient light), though too often in the transfer they appear to be just that.  Having viewed the DVD shortly after seeing the original again as it made a one-time showing in a local theater (not too many years back), which was still using standard film projectors, and I immediately noticed the difference.  Comparing CE3K's preservation, to the restored version of the original Star Wars, is just plain sad.  (I've heard rumors that Trumbull actually filmed the original effects for CE3K in 65mm; in any event, to my eye, the digital transfer is noticeably poorer than the 35mm.)  Perhaps it can be said that even Chaplin film restorations have now enjoyed better final results; it can be hoped that one day CE3K will enjoy a better transfer.

There is a very awkward cut in the special edition (and in the director's cut) dealing with the Neary family, where Ronnie is first sitting with some of Roy's junk in her hands--and then, just moments later, when it cuts back to her--we see her holding her daughter instead. In the original edition, the scene of Ronnie holding her daughter is the first time we see her.  Teri Garr did a great job as Ronnie, though in my opinion she gave a more nuanced and moving performance in, 'The Black Stallion.'

I could never understand why the trucks secretly hauling scientific equipment are disguised as Piggly Wiggly and Baskin Robbins trucks. At that point they were still trying to figure out what cover story to get people out of the area with; maybe they were thinking of scaring them away with high cholesterol foods? I also find it hard to understand why there is a scene showing the volunteer astronauts wearing the special red suits as they go into a chartered bus. When sitting in what looks like a university auditorium, learning the hand signals, they are not wearing the red suits, but are singled out by having ""special"" seats off to the side. So why do they need the suits going into the bus in order to be visually singled out for the audience? The scene where the team members damage the expensive globe is a bit jolting, and seems a bit silly at first; but I can imagine they were planning to bring it back from the get go not realizing how big it was until they got to the county supervisor's office where it was kept, and so, instead of going back to get the coordinates and paper, they stuck to the original idea of just bringing back the globe for everyone to see, and thus infamously dropped it to the floor and rolled it to their destination.  True enough, when people wing it, stuff happens.

I can only say that the Wyoming tower (known by Native American cultures as 'Bear Lodge' and a traditional place for religious retreat), for the final scenes, was an inspired choice by Spielberg.  Situated in a lush prairie and part of the Black Hills, it is evidently the only volcanic structure in the North American plains (protruding through layers of exposed sedimentary rocks dating back to the Triassic age) and effectively symbolizes as well as gives a visceral sense of something which reaches deep into the earth.  Spielberg has said he wanted to underscore the earthly location of the story; he succeeded beautifully.  Add to that even its 'western name' mentioned in the film--insofar as it only underscores a tower which goes down instead of up--or rather, given that the mothership arrives upside down before turning right side up to land: poetry in motion.  The earthly witnesses of the mothership, looking up, are thus shown looking 'down' onto city skyscrapers made by aliens who, wherever they are from, have long looked towards the earth simply when looking up towards their sky.  (Of course, we need not appeal to extraterrestrials, to accommodate these differences in perspective.)  Add to that the fact that it is a national monument which most people, including most Americans, have never seen: impeccable.

It was real life nephew of Richard Dreyfuss, who plays Neary's younger son Toby (perhaps that is why he had a easier time than his elder brother, Brad, to take in stride Neary's apparent nervous breakdown).

When the movie was first released Watergate scandal / conspiracy was fresh off the press.  Spielberg has said he included a government cover up, to add a sense of realism, even if it is a sort of bluff: how does the audience know that these things of the movie, as well, aren't, 'actually going on right now,' just not the news?  Then again, while CE3K begins, it does not end, in a familiar mock docudrama format (also known to audiences at the time from 'documentaries' on Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster); there is even a character in CE3K who, as a believer in both, compares Big Foot to UFOs in the same breath at a press conference, to Neary's humiliation.  If the film is dated (of course it is in incidental things, like the Nearys' home furnishing, e.g., the color portable boob tube, complete with a dial to change channels, the aviator style glasses so many are wearing, along with the obvious absence in the storyline of GPS and cell phone cameras) I don't think it can be dated in this way.  The film's realism, to its credit, only cuts both ways.  The conspiracy aspect of the film is actually quite limited; the film really only presents it as Major Walsh's idea, for the sake of evacuating people, to secure the area.  Neary is its chief, largely unintentional, victim.  Neary at one point says, 'the army is getting us out of here because they don't want any witnesses.'  They?  Meaning Lacombe?  Neary doesn't say who 'they' is because Neary doesn't (yet) know who they is.  Lacombe, was arguing with Walsh, at that very moment.

The UFO experts themselves in the movie didn't know what to expect to happen at the site any more than did Neary.  Perhaps they knew less; the movie depicts some commercial airline pilots as seeing what Neary and Jillian saw early on, but the pilots decided not to report it (perhaps so as to not risk being labeled nuts and losing their jobs).  The cover up, fittingly, is not presented as invented for the sake of permanently deceiving the world--or involving the UN, the Man from UNCLE, or even the entire US government--and it was not Lacombe's idea at all.  An American UFO expert, who also comments near the end that 'Einstein was right' (a colleague jokingly responding that 'Einstein was probably one of them,' i.e., among those who took a ride on the mothership, thus having had personal experience confirming his prediction of time dilation), was the top official at the press conference, where he told spectators along with Neary, 'I don't know what you saw.'  He obviously knew more than other officials present at the conference yet there is also no reason to believe he was not sincere in his comments.  He was presented simply as discrete, diplomatic, scientifically skeptical; not as conspiratorial.  Perhaps this *could* date the film if: (1) it cannot be fully appreciated if enjoyed as science fiction and/or (2) it's narrative tacitly relies upon audiences, if only by drawing upon Orwell, to imagine many extra layers of 'cover up' and/or (3) historians of science have determined that the direct experimental confirmation of time dilation for space travel had come way before GPS.  No way did the mothership pass unnoticed; Major Walsh simply did *not* evacuate a big enough area.

Walter Cronkite, though mentioned by name, was not the newscaster making the cameo in the movie.  It was, however, the also prominent real life newscaster Howard K. Smith.  There is no suggestion he is to be taken in the story (let alone in reality) as part of any conspiracy; presumably the character was just reporting what Major Walsh and his team told him regarding a relatively mundane story about a train accident.

Personally, I was never much into UFOs, a fact which never detracted from my enjoyment of the movie in the least.  The film did spark my interest enough to actually read (Prof. J. Allen) Hynek's book (i.e., by a prominent, long time astrophysicist, at Northwestern University); yet my conclusion, precisely from reading it, was that there is nothing to it.  What I have read since (notably, regarding the 'anthropic principle' in cosmology, as discussed for example in a book coauthored by astronomer John Barrow and physicist Frank Tipler), has led me to the conclusion that the scientific consensus regarding intelligent life elsewhere (even insofar as it takes into account the Drake equation, just not all the principles invoked by Star Trek), is that, in point of fact, the odds are astronomically against it. The intuitive argument that the universe is so big that it must, rather, be likely, evidently doesn't hold up, as when taking into account the age and size of the universe and the complexity of DNA, the numbers just don't crunch that way.  Then again, by the same token, the odds of us being here would also be astronomically against it, so I won't belabor the point; in any event, here we are.

CE3K was one of the original 'box office blockbusters;' following Jaws, Spielberg, 'did it again;' in other words *alot* of people liked it. This is the only dimension of added 'realism' that has ever meant anything to me; Hynek cameo included, I have never met anyone who thought it was a documentary.  Looking for evidence of friendly and intelligent life in the universe?  A Lily Tomlin joke aside, look no further; even if the 1950s left you wondering, they are actually making movies now, they are even sitting in theaters, right next to you.

Spielberg has referred to his making of the film as a sort of catharsis.  I can understand that.

The grand finale begins immediately after Neary and Jillian show up.  The first few scout ships, pass right by them, before going to the landing area and then signaling to the other ships.  The film therefore does pose the question whether the final encounter (especially of the third kind) would have taken place at all if none of those 'invited' had actually arrived.  Perhaps the aliens would have suspected something was wrong or that humanity just wasn't ready.

CE3K has not enjoyed a sequel.  That's fine; leaves it to the imagination, a bit like the ending of, 'The Life of Pi.'  After learning what Neary went through, does the future activity of the aliens include arranging a special visit with Neary's kids?  Does Neary reconcile with Ronnie?  Does he marry Jillian? What happens to Major Walsh?  It makes no sense for the mothership simply to take Neary away and never return.

The inserted scene in the special edition, which depicts the Cotopaxi as found in the Gobi desert (the 1920s cargo ship thought lost in the Bermuda triangle), in my view has the failing of overextending the mock docudrama format (as well as interfering with the lyrical timing) of the original version.  Though it was nicely filmed, I also have no idea why the helicopters are flying fast so close to the sand dunes, following their contour.

I wouldn't touch the scene where the mothership, when seen for the first time, seems to rise over the mountain rather than descend from space; it is a very powerful visual symbolizing being both ""on earth and among the stars""--and is just ambiguous enough to allow for the mothership merely ""appearing"" to rise while in fact traveling horizontally (relative to the ground at the tower)--an appearance perhaps due to the size of the ship and/or the curvature of the earth--it leaves the audience wondering a bit just what is going on--kind of like watching a moonrise. However, on very close scrutiny, it seems there were some minor flaws in the special effects concerning the mothership (perhaps due to a rushed editing job, which Spielberg admits): In certain scenes the mothership does not appear quite as big as other scenes require. Basically, in the shot of the rising/landing mothership, it should appear about 4x or even 8x (at least 2x) as large if it is to be the ""city in space"" (though even at 1/2 x it would still be too big to escape the notice of Howard K. Smith) which the more close-up shots of the mothership (both outside the ship, as given by all versions, and inside, as given by the special edition) require. (I suspect a similar scene in 'Independence Day' was closer to what Spielberg was technically going for.) Still, the visuals are remarkably effective and quite beautiful, and give a very memorable impression.

I've given alot of analysis, but I don't think I've spoiled anything.  Chesterton echoes Einstein:

""The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. He who knows it not and can no longer wonder, no longer feel amazement, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out candle."" (Albert Einstein)

10346,5,076780192X,"Director Steven Spielberg's classic 1977 follow-up to ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" stars Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary. Neary's just an ordinary blue collar guy, a bit of a dreamer with a taste for Disney films and miniature railroads... until he witnesses a spectacular UFO appearance. Haunted by mental images of a mountain he's never seen before, Neary risks his job, his marriage, his sanity and, eventually, his life to uncover what it all means.
""Close Encounters"" also marks the first appearance of the Spielberg formula. You know, the messy suburban house, the mouthy kids, the whole ""just plain folks involved with something magical"" storyline. And while he gets a lot of knocks, both justified and unjustified, for inflicting this on American movies in the 80s, Spielberg's use of documentary-like elements throughout (as the space people play some Burmuda Triangle-related tricks on what's apparently an international investigation team) and some funky casting (Teri Garr, French director Francois Truffaut, Bob Balaban and others) combine to lend this one a veracity some of his later films- and those of his imitators- sometimes lack. This is a very fresh and original take on sci-fi subject matter, completely without physical violence (although there is some of the emotional kind). Seeing decades later after so many heartless, bombastic, noise and light CGI fests, one can't help but admire Spielberg's ability to get to the emotional core of this material.
Plus, it helps that the cutesy elements are kept to a minimum. There's Melinda Dillon as a single mom whose oh-so-adorable-with-his-big-eyes kid gets kidnapped by the UFOs; the scene is played for scares, rather than laughs and it is genuinely terrifying. Neary's kids are mostly unpleasant, and gone after the halfway point. Dreyfuss downplays Neary's potential drippyness and plays up his frustration and rage as circumstances overwhelm him. And Garr is very believable as Neary's doubtful wife; she keeps the character from becoming a one-note shrew. You actually sympathize with her as she deals with what she thinks is her husband's selfish midlife crisis.
The film ends with an amazing sequence of events and actually takes on an epic scope without losing the human element that makes it all so enjoyable. This DVD release follows the format from the recent ""Jaws"" disk: a gorgeous widescreen print, a few deleted scenes, some documentaries. A handsome release.",1099699200,,2458,5.289002557544757

It is not clear from the start whether to view the visitors as a malevolent or friendly force.  The film introduces us to Roy Neary(Richard Dreyfus) who encounters an alien craft while repairing some downed power lines.  From that moment on he is obsessed with this encounter despite the toll it is taking on his family and his marriage.  We also meet Gillian (Melinda Dillon), a young divorcee whose toddler son has been abducted by the aliens.  The two join forces in attempting to locate these beings despite interference by a seemingly hearltless government beauracracy(""E.T."" again).  They eventually locate the mothership in Wyoming where there is a major multi-national effort to communicate with the mothership.  The scene in which the technicians use musical notes to communicate with the alien craft is classic.  Not to give anything away, when we do finally see the aliens and the inside of the mothership it is something of a letdown.  I like this film immensely, though I wouldn't exactly call it a great film in the legacy of Spielberg.  It's a nice thrill-ride of a movie and you have to put in perspective that this film came at the beginning of Spielberg's career before he evolved into possibly our greatest director.",1097193600,,1365,4.91703056768559
10351,5,076780192X,"""We are not alone!"" screamed the ads when ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" was first released to theaters in 1977. After 95 minutes of suburban angst, the viewer discovered they indeed had a friend from the skies.

I was just a young kid when I first saw ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and I really didn't have a clue what was going on during the surburban angst sequences. But oh how I loved the finale, a special effects-choked extravaganza which became one of the most famous scenes in cinema history. The film's seemingly endless buildup had some kind of payoff, and director Steven Spielberg's career was set for life (well, he did follow this film with ""1941"").

The spring of 1978 was the season of ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters."" My friends and I would debate the qualities of ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters,"" arguing as to which was the better film. For me, a junior high school lad, the greatest film in history was ""Close Encounters.""

I still love Spielberg's epic UFO creation, a sort of quasi-religious experience for a kid raised on ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Invaders From Mars."" In ""Close Encounters,"" the aliens were friendly and most shocking of all - we were nice to them! This had not been done before, as the alien standard was a growling James Arness dressed as a murderous carrot.

These days I still get a child-like thrill when watching ""Close Encounters."" The opening two-thirds of the film are no longer ponderous, but identifiable. The awkward situations of a struggling middle-class family are realistically portrayed. Paul Schrader, noted author of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Hardcore,"" wrote the original draft to this film. One suspects the obsessions and frustrations of Richard Dreyfuss' character came from his tortured pen.

Dreyfuss plays Roy Neary, working-class father and husband who witnesses what he believes to be a UFO. He finds himself tortured by visions seemingly stuck in his head, and he becomes obsessed with UFOs. Like an alcoholic, Neary soon falls apart, losing his job, friends and eventually his family in several harrowing scenes. He befriends Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a single mother who has also witnessed these UFOs and is obsessed with similar visions. Her son is abducted by the aliens in one of the most terrifying scenes in film history. Together, this tortured couple eventually realizes these visions are mysteriously pointing them towards Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Frantically, they travel there even though the U.S. military claims a train wreck has caused deadly gas to cover the countryside. Scientist Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and his eccentric team have devised a musical language enabling them to communicate with the UFOs. The meeting place is, of course, Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Neary and Guiler fight their way to the mountain, stumbling upon a government-constructed landing strip where Lacombe and his scientists hope to meet the aliens. An enormous mothership appears and contact is made with aliens for the first time in human history.

This is not a simple story, and the drama which plays out between Neary and his wife (Teri Garr) is brilliant. Guiler's angst for her missing son is also perfectly portrayed by Dillon, one of the finest character actresses of this era. But the core of ""Close Encounters,"" the moment of truth so to say, is the sequence involving the aliens. There are so many hundreds of ways this scene could have gone wrong. The aliens could have looked fake, but they didn't. The lighting could have been wrong, but it wasn't. The aliens are portrayed as being just as shy as we are - a perfect choice. There's a sense of wonder throughout these extraordinary proceedings. Eventually, one gets the feeling that if we truly meet brothers from another planet, it will happen much as it does in ""Close Encounters.""

If Walt Disney had decided to make a film for adults, it would have looked something like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Maybe Spielberg is the Walt Disney of the ""Easy Rider"" generation. And perhaps that is what ""Close Encounters"" eventually represents - a Baby Boomers' ""Peter Pan.""",1094774400,2,4134,4.982608695652174
10352,4,076780192X,"I used to own a Criterion Collection laserdisc with both versions of the movie. Why no Criterion dvd? AND, why hasn't Columbia made a Superbit Edition??!!",1093651200,,154,4.961538461538462
10353,5,076780192X,"When I was six years old, I sat with my friend Kevin on his jungle-gym in his backyard at night and stared up at the sky.  It was a very brisk evening with little humidity, and the light pollution from the nearby highway took only a small portion of the horizon out of view.  It was the best night sky I've ever seen in suburbia in my conscious 25 years.  We spent I don't know how long staring into space, but for some reason that night every blinking ball of light on an airplane or any other airborne object was to me a UFO.

We began saying things like, ""Look at that one!  That one!""  I believed for a long time afterwards that what I saw that one night were alien ships circling Earth, that we were not alone, and that it wouldn't be long before everyone else knew what I knew.  Of course I was a tremendous fan of Sci-fi films like ""Last Starfighter"", ""Explorers"", the ""Star Wars"" films, TV shows like ""Transformers"" (later on in life a show called ""Space: Above and Beyond"" would get cancelled much to my disappointment).  I was the believing nerd; you couldn't convince me aliens weren't real.

Everytime I watch ""Close Encounters"" I get that same chill I remember from being six.  That sensation the actors have on screen when they look up at the sky and suddenly realize that there's more to watch for than just stars is real because I felt the same way that night.

The plot is about a middle-age man Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) whose family life disintegrates after a close encounter of the second kind with an alien spacecraft as he's called out on a job late at night.  Lost on the roads, he stops to check a map when suddenly  blinding lights appear from above.  No his truck doesn't go soaring up into a spaceship, no Neary doesn't get probed, instead his truck dies, there's a moment of anti-gravity, and Neary gets a nice sun-burn on one side of his face.

UFO cliches die a happy death in this film.  The aliens are neither aggressive, nor are they provoked into being aggressive.  In fact, they are perfectly benevolent, if not partially enigmatic.  Spielberg wanted to show a range of diversity amongst the aliens that would be parallel to humans, so you have short, stubby aliens, lanky, stick-figure aliens, and also more humanoid aliens that are expressive.  Nowhere are there crop-circles, there are no long exegeses on their superior technology, no ray guns, no tractor beams or teleportations.  Meeting the aliens is actually a highly organic experience; achieved with colors, musical themes, and staring one another face-to-face.

In fact, nothing is really explained, it just happens and plays itself out.  How are these people having visions of Devil's Tower in Wyoming, the exact coodinates of the alien visitation?  How do they prepare the ""arena"" that's like a landing pad next to Devil's Tower?  What's up with the alien technology?  Do they have warp-drive capabilities?  Do they have anti-matter containment units?  Do they explore ""temporal disturbances"" like the crew of the Enterprise show after show?

The questions are all moot.  ""Close Encounters"" is just about the encounter, the experience, not about the calculator or the engineer.  If you're looking for explorations of futuristic technology and the ""Cool!!!"" factor, apply somewhere else.

This is somehow the reason why I come back to the night sky again and again.  I've heard more than one backyard astronomer describe the night sky as a reliable, familiar friend.  Herein lies the true form on ""Close Encounters,"" not that technology such as what the aliens possess exsists, or that we are enlightened by their coming.  What gives form to the film's premise is the possibility that when we look up at the stars, those stars are looking back.",1092268800,3,3740,4.765163297045101
10354,1,076780192X,"The film  ""Close Encounters"" is one of the best Spielberg ever directed,some would argue THE best and I would be hard pressed to counter that assertion.
This is indeed a wonderful movie ,a film that works on multiple levels and on a grand scale that focuses on the people that have encountered UFOs up close and personal. Spielberg even gave the late Prof. Allen Hynek famed UFO researcher from North Western University a cameo role near the end of the picture to lend it an even more realistic touch.
However Spielberg has stated more than once that he would NEVER release the movie as it was originally shown and true to his word he has so far stubbornly carried out his promise. His reasoning on this point totally baffles this reviewer. It IS a wonderful film,what is the problem Mr. Spielberg?
Therefore if you  would like to see an uncut/original version of this film,NOTHNG at ths time of writing is available to satisfy your desire. Nor does it look promising for the forseeable future. What a pity. I have viewed every version released on video and DVD and each one changes the feel and direction of the movie in some way and none of them match the impact and intent of the original.

The acting in any scene involving the Nearys is astounding.  Even though that family doesn't end up the way we might hope, they behave exactly like a real family might when faced with their situation.  Pay special attention to the children.

10357,5,076780192X,"Director:  Steven Spielberg
Cast:  Richard Dreyfuss, Francois Truffaut, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon.
Running Time: 137 minutes.
Rated PG for mild language and some intense situations.
Fresh off the outrageous success of his first hit ""Jaws"", Steven Spielberg creates the extra-terrestrial epic ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  While obviously a film about aliens, Spielberg uses star Richard Dreyfuss as a chess piece to how the mystique and mystery of a foreign being can not only cause a man to go crazy, but can ultimately influence mankind as a whole.
Dreyfuss is extremely under-rated in his performance as a man driven to the brink as he experiences an otherworldy encounter with extra-terrestrials while inside of his vehicle.  Not knowing the affect this would later have on his life, he returns home as if nothing happened.  Dreyfuss's behavior grows stranger and stranger (he first makes a mountain out of mashed potatoes at the dinner table, then creates an even larger model of this mysterious mountain out of his yard while still inside his house), he realizes that he most confront this incredible feeling that has overcome his mind and search for answers.  What he encounters is magical and unbelievable.
Spielberg's direction is top-notch and sincere, proving that his previous sucess was not a fluke.  Much like his other alien film, ""E.T"", ""Close Encounters..."" provides  a symbolic theme that is far more significant than what the aliens look like or what planet they came from.  With the peformance of Dreyfuss, Spielberg is able to to show that it is okay for all of us to return to the kid we once were, and to explore all of the questions that we all want answers for.  A true spectacle of a film with superb special effects, a wonderful musical score by John Williams, and a child-like charm that is for the whole family.",1085184000,2,1849,4.9546925566343045
10358,5,076780192X,"It had been years since I had watched this film and i wanted to see whether it would have the same impact on me as it when i saw it almost 20 years ago.
  Perhaps unsurprisingly it was every bit as intimidating, eerie, and tremendously entertaining as it was back then.
  Ask any UFO buff and he/she'll tell you that when it comes to films about the ""objects in the sky"" there are very few, extremely few, that can demand good notes from the audiences.
  ""Close encounters"" is definately one of them, a film that despite a near 30 yrs after its release it still jumps at you (small screen or big) and is at the same time thought provoking.
  Spielberg has some tremendous (especially at the box office) hits under his belt but in the minds of many this might be one of his very best films. If not the best.
  As ""they"" arrive with lightning-speed craft that cruise the skies of a small american town, scanning and patroling while getting the attention of every local in sight it seems like a collective obsession takes over the residents and the viewers together.
  What do they want? Who are they?
  The questions, the fear, the immense intimidation, the complications and the implications come through in brilliant manner through all the characters that parade through this classic film.
  But what still impresses is that ""Close encounters"" manages to remain intelligent even if you see it today. That might sound
like a moot point to those that love this film but it's a legitimate point. Spielberg doesnt ridicule the issue, doesnt attempt to offer some laughable debunking, doesnt dismiss it, but instead takes it full-on with the seriousness it demands.
  And even when the film has its funny moments the focus isn't lost for a single second.
  All the more wowing is the fact that effects still look pretty damn good and i saw it in my small living room TV. Sure, it might reek of that 70s aura all along but that's inevitable and it really doeasn't come across as annoying, if anything that even adds to the charm.
  Funny and certinaly bizzare that I haven't seen a good film with this theme in a long, long while, unless we consider braindead disasters like ""Independence day"" contenders.
  This is why i picked up to the DVD and the reward factor was immense.
  The extra features on this limited edition disc are seriously interesting as well.
  Way up there with the cinematic classics regardless of genre. If you haven't seen this check it out.

10359,5,076780192X,"After the release of JAWS in 1975, Steven Spielberg became the most popular director in Hollywood. People were wondering what he would do for his next picture, he already knew! Steven Spielberg had wrote a script called CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND when he was 18 years old. He tried to get the movie made, but no studios wanted to take their chance with an unknown director with such a big project. With JAWS becoming the highest-grossing movie of all-time, Steven set himself to direct his movie. The movie was bought by Columbia Pictures who was facing some financial difficulties at the time. The project was given a $20 million budget, which was extremely high at the time. Steven hired again Richard Dreyfuss to play the lead role. Principal photography of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND started in November of 1975 and continued through 1976. The production was extremely big and had many technical problems. For the special effects, Steven hired ILM to produce some of the most amazing special effects in movie history. Before the release of the movie, people were pessimistic at the idea of the movie saying it was too science-fiction, but when CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND opened on November 17th, 1977, critics were all agreeing to say that the movie was a masterpiece. The movie grossed $166 million domesticlly, becoming the second-highest grossing movie of 1977 just behind STAR WARS, who beated JAWS as the highest-grossing movie of all-time. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was nominated many times at the 1978 Academy Awards and garnered Steven Spielberg a Best Director nomination, something that JAWS didn't do. The movie was re-released in 1982 and then released on VHS in 1988 as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND : THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION. In 2001, it was released as a collector's two-disc DVD edition containing many bonus features.",1071878400,2,1876,4.977707006369426
10360,5,076780192X,"I admit it: I'm not a Richard Dreyfuss fan. I have only really liked him in two movies -- George Lucas' American Grafitti and Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
Until recently, I had only seen bits and pieces of Spielberg's 1977 UFO classic. I never had the time or inclination to sit down and watch the whole movie. That is, until my current boyfriend (a true Spielberg aficionado) purchased the Collector's Edition DVD. We sat down in my living room and watched it.
What surprised me about Spielberg's film is how well the story of a peaceful encounter between humanity and a spacefaring civilization is told. Not only are the 1977 special effects still effective, but the human interest part of Close Encounters was compelling. As seen mostly from the point of view of Indiana electrical engineer Roy Neary (Dreyfuss), the movie depicts the mystery and wonder of how we discover that we are not alone in this universe. It shows that even though Neary loses almost everything to the compulsion mysteriously implanted into his mind, he eventually finds that his sacrifices were worth it.
The movie is never boring. Instead, even though it's not a film like Star Wars with ray guns and explosions, it's fast-paced and interesting. It takes its cues from actual UFO sightings and other unexplained mysteries (such as Flight 19, the 5-plane training flight that disappeared off the coast of east Florida in December of 1945) and ends up with a realistic scenario for a ""close encounter"" between humans and aliens. The acting is excellent, and the young Spielberg got great performances not only from Dreyfuss, but also from Teri Garr (Veronica Neary), Melinda Dillon (Gillian Guiller), Francois Truffaut (Lacombe) and Gary Guffey (Barry). Also adding to the magic was composer John Williams, whose 5-note musical phrase became famous as the proof that music is truly a universal language.
The two-disc collector's edition includes the movie in wide screen format, with a second disc that contains a making-of documentary, eleven deleted scenes, plus theatrical trailers. Both picture and sound are excellent and considering it's a two-DVD set, the price is affordable. I give this movie a strong endorsement.",1065916800,4,2226,5.084699453551913
10361,5,076780192X,"I really liked the way this movie used mystery and linked it with good feelings. Spielberg and others who worked on this film, used their imaginations to create positive symbols for the unknown. Roy who was played by Richard Dreyfuss, was child like in his excitement and drive to discover and learn more about his encounter. His child like desire seems to touch the viewer and get them caught up in the movie, feeling his fascination. He kept saying, ""I know this is important""! The film has awesome special effects and for that time period was really spectacular. It is definately a classic, at least for me. The only sad part was that Roy's family left him. They seemed like a happy, busy, bustling family before Roy's encounter. Instead of supporting him, they turned away with fear and distance. I felt that was dissappointing. Although, I liked watching him build the mud mountain in his living room, if I was his wife, I may have drawn the line of support there. I also liked Teri Garr's performance. I think she is a good and funny actor. Wouldn't it be eerie to experience an encounter? It kinda makes you wonder if anything is being covered up out there, stuff they don't want you to know about???

10362,5,076780192X,"Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Steven Spielberg's 1977 UFO classic, is the thematic antitheses to 1996's Independence Day.  While Roland Emmerich's ID4 is a throwback to 1950s ""invaders from space"" flicks, Spielberg's vision of a ""close encounter"" between humanity and extraterrestrials is more mysterious and, in the end, more hopeful and awe-inspiring.  Instead of exchanging bullets and ""heat rays,"" humans and aliens communicate by using musical notes.
Spielberg's screenplay divides Close Encounters roughly into three acts, basically corresponding to each of the three kinds of  ""encounters.""
In the first category, sightings of a UFO, we first see a very strange sight in the Mexican desert: an international team of researchers led by French UFO expert Lacombe (the late Francois Truffaut) and guided by several Mexican Federales finds five World War II vintage Grumman TBM Avengers.  The planes are abandoned but strangely intact, as though they were brand new.  ""Who flies this kind of plane?"" asks a bewildered cartographer/interpreter named Laughlin (Bob Balaban).
""No one,"" replies another astonished researcher. ""This is Flight 19.""
(Flight 19, of course, is a reference to a Navy training flight which took off from Ft. Lauderdale one morning in December 1945 and vanished, along with a Martin Mariner search plane sent up to look for the missing planes and crews.  Flight 19 is now famous in the lore of unsolved mysteries related to the Bermuda triangle.)
 Laughlin is baffled by something else, as well.  A Mexican villager, old, sunburned, and seemingly delirious, keeps repeating, ""El sol salio anoche y me canto. El sol salio anoche y me canto.""  When Laughlin asks what the phrase mean, a researcher who is fluent in Spanish says, in an awed tone, ""He says the sun came out last night.  He says it sang to him.""
Later, in the Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, a more dramatic close encounter of the first kind plays out on the radar scopes as airliner pilots call in reports of bright lights in the sky and unknown contacts make their presence known.  For a few tense minutes it look as though tragedy is imminent, but within moments the contacts vanish into the night sky.  Torn between reporting a UFO sighting or just letting the incident slide by, pilots and air traffic controllers alike opt to keep quiet, mainly to avoid having to fill out tons of bureaucratic paperwork.
As important as these sequences are, the focus of Spielberg's story is on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an employee of a Midwestern power company whose life on Earth is ordinary, hectic, and somewhat unfulfilling.  Sent out to investigate a section of power lines in rural Indiana (caused, of course, by the UFOs' passage), Neary has a close encounter of the first kind and impulsively goes on a truck-borne pursuit of two small ""flying saucers.""  This sequence, which ends with a Keystone Kops-like police chase of the same UFOs, triggers an obsession within Neary that neither his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) nor his children will understand, much less accept.  Neary, along with several hundred other people from different towns and states, will soon be haunted by both a visual image and a simple five-note musical phrase.  The traces of the UFO flights that leave traces behind (sunburn on people who, like Neary, were exposed to bright light at night) are known as close encounters of the second kind.
Spielberg weaves Neary's everyman-faces-an-extraordinary- situation plot with the official investigations being carried out by the UN-sponsored Lacombe team and a more secretive U.S. government First Contact program.  These plot threads will all lead to a climactic and awe-inspiring close encounter of the third kind: actual (and documented) contact between humanity and another space-faring civilization.
The Columbia/Tri-Star Collector's Edition brings not only a newly re-edited version (trimming some excess material from the 1980 Special Edition) of the 1977 film, but also comes with a second disc loaded with extras such as a Laurent Bouzereau documentary on the making of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a 1977 promotional featurette, and the theatrical trailers.",1062633600,73,4193,5.206537890044577
10363,4,076780192X,"Close Encounters of the Third Kind was a revolutionary film for its time, which is why it is so highly appreciated by so many.  Including moi.  It not only wowed people with special effects, but a story line.  For once, an alien film didn't include corny music and screaming women standing out in the streets, or little green men shooting lasers or what not.  This film brought sci-fi films to a new degree.
So often, we see sci-fi films inter-relate with horror films, this is no horror film, it's a true sci-fi film.  The suspense does not come from terror, but from wonder and awe.
I've read some reviews that state that you shouldn't show awe towards aliens that kidnap and brainwash people.  From what I saw, there was no brainwashing, and the kidnapping was not as big a deal as you may think at first.
Richard Dreyfuss gives a hell of a performance in this.  He's an ordinary guy whose life gets turned around by these phenominal events, which are the sighting of UFOs.  Other ordinary people are effected as well.  This is the power of the film.  The heroes aren't these Indiana Jones or super experts who know ""everything"" about aliens.  They are people, like you and I, who have a drastic change of viewpoint.
Other reviewers complain about Dreyfuss's character because he becomes obsessed with this phenom.  Well, excuse me, but if your entire world as you knew it was suddenly changed because you realized that there were higher forms of intelligent life out there, you might become obsessed yourself in figuring out the truth.  It's realistic and human to be curious.
I think this movie was very realistic and avoided the corny, unrealism of other sci-fi junk.  The negatives of this movie is:
1. Not enough Alien parts, meaning there needed to be more encounters with Dreyfuss or with other people.  There were only two, not counting the end.  This isn't enough, at least I felt, to get a good grip that this film is about Aliens and not government cover up.  Because the first third is about the Aliens impacting people's lives, while the other two thirds is government conspiracy or the recreation of Devil's Peak either through dirt, mashed potatos, or drawings.
2. As a result, to not enough encounters with the Aliens, the film can be quite boring at certain points.  Now when I say encounters, I don't necessarily mean having more scenes where they fly around and buzz people with their space ships.  Not at all, I mean more alien phenoms, like the ship in the middle of the desert or the lost air planes now suddenly found.  These were great, there needed to be more of them.
3. The ending.  I don't know, it was awe inspiring but at the same time real boring.  There needed to be a climax, and I think Spielberg felt that the aliens showing themselves would be it.  I'd rather they hadn't shown the aliens, that would've been more real.  Think about it, making contact with an entirely different species?  Not real.
Plus, Dreyfuss just suddenly given the nod to travel with them, even though he's wanted by the government?  I mean come on, not real.
4. Because this film has some lengthy, boring scenes, it's more likely than not this won't be an addictive film.  You may see it more than once but you'll probably allow a great deal of time to pass in between, because it's a film of wonder not a film of entertainment galore.
As you can see, there are some flaws that keep this film from being totally realistic.  But for the most part it is, and I liked it.  I think you need to see this film, you will enjoy it for the first time at least.  Seeing it again and again?  I don't know about that.  That's why it's four stars and not five.

10364,5,076780192X,"To me, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is without doubt one of the best Science Fiction movies ever made.
Under its seemingly simple premise, it takes us on a wonderful journey: the story of a man faced with something more formidable than him, and his relentless, unwavering drive to get the answers he seeks, whatever the cost to him.
Richard Dreyfuss is the symbol of our humanity: fragile, slightly immature, drowned in his own problems, unable to face them, overwhelmed by what happens to him, but uncontrollably driven toward this unknown that touched him one night and changed his life forever.
The other important role is that of Franois Truffaut (the famous French director) who plays the role of the scientist who attempts to understand what the aliens are doing and prepares first contact. This is the only role that Truffaut ever accepted in a Foreign film.
What I like best about the movie is its positive message: it's not the military that were chosen to get on the alien ship, but the simple guy, the only true representative of humanity.
Get this DVD, there are hours of goodies on both discs, and I especially liked the bits about the music, by John Williams. This is without doubt the best and richest score he made for any Spielberg movie.
To those who complain that they don;t get to see the inside of the mother ship, they should know that Speilberg never intended us to see that. It was forced upon him to shoot these sequences for the previous special edition of the movie. There is no need to see the inside of the ship, we know it's formidable and here, imagination takes over.",1059264000,,1605,4.654929577464789
10375,4,076780192X,"Steven Spielberg's second smash hit, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is an effective, optimistic, and visually appealing film.  In the light of current special effects, it's showing its age, but the story still retains wonder and interest.  Richard Dreyfuss is very effective as the man who sights a group of U.F.O.'s and then becomes obsessed with them.  Others that have made sightings share the obsession, including a woman whose child is abducted by the aliens.  A seed is implanted in their minds that draws them to Wyoming.  Their stories are intercut with the story of two scientists (played by Truffault and Baliban) who are investigating the strange re-appearance of ships and planes that have been missing for years, and which turn up in strange locales.  They, too, receive a message (along the more conventional method of radio contact) to head to Wyoming.
Dreyfuss logs the bulk of the screen time, and he easily carries the film.  As his marriage melts down in the wake of his obsession, he manages to maintain our sympathy and interest.  Truffault is a surprisingly effective actor, even when speaking through an interpreter.  Even the child that gets abducted has a great performance.  Likewise, the pacing and suspense through the first 2/3 of the film is flawlessly executed by Spielberg, not revealing too much and intercutting short bursts of action with more contemplative and personal scenes.
Unfortunately, the film grinds down to a deadly pace in the last 1/3 of the film.  It is essentially 40 minutes of a faceless mob (of scientists) and Dreyfuss staring at the sky and watching lights appear and disappear.  Yes, the effects are good, even by today's standards, but it is boring!  Similarly, Teri Garr as the protagonist's wife is nothing but a carricatured harpy, and their breakup is clumsily handled by the immature (at the time) director.  All in all, though, the film holds up well to time and repeated viewings.
This DVD edition is quite nice, with a 100-minute feature with commentary and insight from most of the principle filmakers and stars (except Truffault, who had passed away).  Spielberg does not do commentaries for his films, but he talks a lot in the feature which should sate the film buffs.  There are also some deleted scenes, including the ""new"" ending Columbia demanded for the ""Special Edition"" release in 1980.  The original 1977 ending is maintained for the film on this DVD (and rightfully so!).",1049328000,,2453,4.987714987714988
10376,2,076780192X,"""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" was a movie I fondly remember from my youth as kindling that spark of cinema magic that seems to be in short supply these days.  For its day the visual effects were mesmorizing and the prospect that we are not alone in this universe became very real for me after viewing this movie.  Plot: People from all walks of life are brought to the Arizona desert by a series of space ship visits to our planet earth.
Columbia Tristar has really angered me with this release.  Steven Spielberg should be none too thrilled with them either.  Their 2 disc special edition presents his masterpiece in a digitally grainy, thoroughly unsatisfying visual quality topped off by excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, low contrast levels, colors that bleed and an overall visual characteristic that ranges from too, too soft to digitally harsh.  There's no happy medium.  The arrival of the alien mother ship is totally ruined by excessive pixelization that breaks up fine details.  This is not the way I want to remember this sci-fi classic.  The soundtrack is dated but overall well represented.  The extras include a making of that is informative but a direct import from Columbia's laserdisc and some extra test and rehearsal footage that is somewhat dry.  I think Columbia would do wise to just hand over their film library to more capable hands to preserve.  Of late their transfers have gotten even worse than this.  However with this DVD release, there was a definite beginning to that end!",1048809600,4,1531,4.891472868217054

10380,5,076780192X,I saw this film when I was very young and it was very haunting and beautiful at the time.  After seeing it again recently I have to say that it is truly a masterpiece.  Richard Dreyfuss's intense focus for answers along with the Miltitary's attempted cover up of UFO contact keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Gotta love the mash potatoes and shaving cream scenes also.  I don't know how it could have been any better. (Some people don't like this film?!)  The exchanges with his wife are done wonderfully also.  You want her to believe him but she just can't make that jump in faith.  John Williams does a masterful job here and truly creates an atmosphere of intrigue and wonder.  It is one of my favorite film scores also.  If you are a Spielberg fan I highly recommend it.,1044144000,4,778,4.384615384615385
10381,2,076780192X,"Close Encounters has great special effects and an amazing light show but the story is so humorless, cold and sterile, I cannot recommend this movie.
We're supposed to sympathize with Richard Dreyfuss's character who becomes possessed with a vision imparted within him by super-intelligent, super-sensitive aliens.  But how can anyone sympathize with a man who willingly throws away his wife and children to follow some vague abstract space vision.
And yet we're not supposed to think of Dreyfuss as a victim of an alien-induced obsession.  Rather, Spielberg wants us to be in awe of and admire these aliens who are, in Spielburg's view, a more intelligent, advanced enlightened species than the human species.  But the facts of his story completely contradict this Spielberg vision of alien goodness and virtue.  The aliens kidnap and/or brainwash innocent people for no apparent reason and yet, because they're ""sensitive"" and intelligent, we're supposed to go ""awwww"" and think how wonderful they are.
The acting is fair but nothing special.  The only truly good acting performance is by Teri Garr who realistically and grippingly shows what is like to have one's life turned upside down by a spouse who's caught in the grip of an obsession.  Other than Ms. Garr, the rest of the cast is either way over-the-top (Dreyfuss) or forgettable.
Close Encounters is long, pretentious, sometimes dull, but often visually interesting to look at.  If you want to see a great light show, rent it.  If you want to watch a compelling movie, look somewhere else.",1043625600,11,1550,5.098814229249012

Unlike the sci-fi films of the 1950's that revolve around UFO's and alien contact on Earth that usually had the aliens being evil and coming to dominate and destroy the Earth,  Mr. Spielberg depicts them as benign and friendly.  The visual effects were first rate in 1977 and are a far cry from today's studio wizardry, they are not hokey and actually hold up well.  The cast all give fine performances including Mr. Dreyfuss, Teri Garr as his beleaguered wife and Melinda Dillon scored a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her role as a fellow contactee.  Although the film was not nominated for Best Picture, Mr. Spielberg received his first Best Director nomination and the film won one award for Best Cinematography and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects.",1043280000,2,784,4.916666666666667
10383,5,076780192X,".... Spielberg re-released it with additional footage in 1980, then altered it again for the film's 1997 re-release on VHS with the extra footage dropped and some scenes never released put back in. Additional material aside, does the film itself deserve a place in the collection of all-time great Science Fiction? The answer is a resounding yes, as the film conveys a sense of excitement, wonder and obsession. Differing from other nihhlistic sci fi films (The Alien movies), Close Encounters is a story of a Roy (Richard Dreyfuss), who, after having an encounter with a U.F.O, starts to become fixated with images and sounds that draw him to the film's conclusion. Roy is the everyman in this movie, and the film centres on a reocurring Spielbergian theme of extraordinary events happening to ordinary people.
Dreyfuss, ... is brilliant in this film, with his gradual obsessions and transfixion creating a fascinating film, which has become an undisputed classic. The oft-imitated famous five note tune composed by the maestro John Williams is only one of the memorable moments of the film, including Roy's obsession with the image that haunts him, the chase up Devil's Tower and the re-appearance of all the people abducted by the aliens. Carlo Rambaldi's excellent alien creations surpass most CGI attempts at realism. As far as the various versions of the film go, the definitive one is this DVD, with the extended ending omitted, leaving the film more complete, regardless of the shortened running time. A true classic that will be remebered as one of the greatest Sci Fi films in film history.",1042848000,3,1600,5.041509433962264
10384,5,076780192X,"This is such a great, great, great film. It succeeds on so many levels and this new directors cut is the best presentation of this film yet. Many scenes are restored to the film that I think add nicely to the build up and some have been removed that add to the mystery at the end, such as not showing us the inside of the ship from  Richard Dreyfuss's perspective. Also the use of Devils Tower, a black monolith combined with the eerie choral overture is a Spielberg homage to Kubrick's 2001. It is interesting to note that the government organization that is researching the aliens use the illuminati pyramid as their symbol indicating to the audience the secret society connections, they even have their own flag. Also I believe that Spielberg is clearly pointing out to us by the way the aliens arrive in clouds and thunder with flashing lights that they may very well be the God of the bible. Them choosing a mountain to appear for communication, descending upon it in cloud and thunder is right out of the old testament. Also the smaller ships have a definite face or animal like appearance and remind one of the visions of the bible prophets and from a distance can appear like stars in the sky when they mimic the big dipper which could also explain the ancient worlds fascination with the stars. But to remove all doubt Spielberg holds a church blessing on the team that will be going back with the aliens, as the minister gives the blessing he reads from a passage of the bible talking about angels lifting us up and in the background is a Christian cross side by side with the star of David. A deeper film than many believe and overall a beautiful DVD transfer with incredible sound.",1041638400,,1693,4.532679738562091

When VHS came out I hoped the far superior original '77 version of the film would become available but they only offered that aweful ""SE"" version.  Now the DVD is out and again Speilberg has blown it.  At least he has finally admitted that showing the inside of the mothership was a big mistake.  STill, he seemed to think the rest of his changes were worth making.  In my view everything they ended up doing weakened a once great film.  Now I hate that film.  It sucks.  I understand the only way to view the great origional '77 version is on laser disk which are probably very hard to find.

Still, having seen most versions of the film with it's various

This is one of Steven Spielbergs first films, and was very successful. At the time their was a lot of interest in UFOs in the mainstream. The special effects in this movie are stunning, and the UFOs look amazing. There is also a small romance undercurrent present.

The acting is good.  I don't know what it is, but this is a film that I am rarely tempted to watch.  For me, this is a ""pull it out once every five years"" film.  I find the development of the plot lines to be interesting and one that raises numerous questions.  I just am not terribly interested in the way the director chose to answer those questions.  It doesn't gel for me.  In the end I kind of have a 'so that's it?' feeling.

I just happened to finish watching it and let me just say that it still has the power of leaving un unforgettable and lasting impression!!!  I'm not really going to go into what the movie is about since if your reading this you most likely already know but just about how I think it was philosophically perceived back in the late 70's and how people look upon it today.  To be quite honest it really saddens me to hear some of the reviews  that people have given this film.  But I can sort of understand  why someone would give it a poor review.  In this particular case, and as with some of the films that came out of the 70's, I think it boils down to the rejection of the deeper meaning that the film is trying to project as opposed to simply focusing on the simple facts of the story plot itself.  What makes this film so beautiful and entertaining at the same time is that it allows us to maintain a sense of wonderment into the reasons why these aliens came down in the first place, what their intentions are and where this all will go. The film is simply in my opinion an introduction into the beauty and wonder of the universe.  Sort of how we humans view ourselves here on earth and in relationship to the universe.  We don't really have to know or might not even want to know what the intentions of the aliens really are.  Close Encounters is at heart a religous experience and if we did know the answers to these question the wonder and beauty of it all would simply be taken away only to make the film less powerful and highly rational.  You can also look at movies from the same era like The Exorcist and Taxi Driver and say the same  thing.  What was really going on in Travis Bickle's mind that allowed the social decay and degredation of his world to drive him to the film's violent climax?  Just why exactly was Regan McNeil choosen by Satan?  Allowing these questions to go unanswered allows us the viewer to step inside the character's world and make our own individual answers.  Thats why these movies were so great and have really stood the test of time.  In today's world we're used to knowing the reasons for why things happen which of couse in itself isn't a bad thing.  But in certain cases, and certainly in the case of close encounters, sometimes the mystery is in itself the driving force.",1026864000,3,2388,4.361990950226244

Set in a small town in Illinois (aka Spielbergville), it tells the story of Roy Neary and his encounter with a UFO.  Roy is trapped in a meaningless job in an unhappy marriage with his unimaginative kids.  Roy and others like him will embark on a quest that will lead them to first contact with aliens (hence the title).  As in many Spielberg films, certain themes and events re-occur, eg. reluctant fathers, abduction of children by supernatural forces, references to world war two and old movies, and a sense of fear and wonder of the unknown.
Adding to the wonderful story, Spielberg has at his disposal terrific special effects and a wonderful John Williams score.  Who will ever forget the final incredible half hour when the UFOs dance overhead bathing us with beautiful colours and light while communicating with us via music.

Including the then 5-year-old Drew Barrymore. The model making, lighting, location scouting and even the actual shooting of the scenes can be found here.
Listening to Spielberg discuss almost every aspect of the making of this film is fascinating. And you get two versions of the movie. The one he originally cut and the theatrical release. For Sci-Fi fans the original version Steven cut is far more superior.
This is a must DVD to have. The Collectors Edition is great and is worth watching over and over again.

10424,3,076780192X,"I would really rate this as 3.5 stars but not 4, so I'm forced to give it a 3.
First off, the movie overall is excellent. Heck, I was 11 years old when this came out and I LIVED in Muncie, Indiana when it was released. The theater went nuts when the subtitle came on, saying ""Muncie, IN"", and then seeing Roy wearing a Ball State University shirt, well that just got the crowd in the theatre all worked up. We loved it!
I saw the ""Special Edition"" on VHS when it came out. I was a little diasppointed at the time when the scene with Roy tearing up his lawn was removed from that edition.
However, I wasn't as disappointed with that version as I am with this. Many of the scenes from the 1st SE have been moved off to the second DVD as deleted scenes. A bad choice in my opinion. However, those scenes that were missing in the SE from the original release are back in with some other new scenes plonked in as well. Still, it's a disappointment with the other scenes missing.
But, the other features on the second DVD are great. But, I wish Columbia/TriStar would take notice of how James Cameron released T2 - The Ultimate Edition. In that release, you have the choice of 3 versions of the movie on the same DVD: The original theatrical release, the Special Edition which came out a few years later on VHS, and then a third version with more deleted scenes in addition to the SE version. I don't know why Columbia/TriStar/Spielberg couldn't have done the same for Close Encounters.
The picture itself is great and the sound is excellent. Much better than the original release back in 1977, but of course, technology for sound has improved vastly since then, so it's not a surprise. Still, it's amazing how the sound can make a difference in how a movie is presented.
To have this on DVD is a must. Now, if Spielberg would release the Indiana Jones movies and Lucas would release the 2nd trilogy of Star Wars as well on DVD, my sci-fi/action DVD collection would be almost complete.",1023926400,40,1980,4.412568306010929

10426,5,076780192X,"This movie, along with Goodbye Girl and the fantastic JAWS, are all excellent showcases of Richard Dreyfuss's amazing talent.  The movies he's been in lately have been so disappointing in comparison.  If you haven't seen this movie you are probably much younger than I am, since it was right up there with the Star Wars trilogies as the THE movie of the time, and I have to highly recommend it.  Beautifully done, and the ending is a good surprise.  I would have done the same thing he did!

10427,3,076780192X,"'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' is more of a children's movie.  Although adults will appreciate it, most of them will wonder what was the point behind it.  On a crystal clear summer night, average citizens witness what appear to be UFOs in the sky.  For some the UFOs affect them more than others.  A child, his mother, Richard Dreyfuss, and a dozen other unnamed people begin seeing visions in their head.  They see a geographical structure, but can't make sense of it.  Later they find out it is Devil's Tower in the west.  Cut between these stories are small stories of strange events happening across the world; stretching from Mexico to India.  In the middle of the Gobi desert, a seaship is found.
Finally our heros, Richard Dreyfuss and a woman reach the Devil's Tower for the climax.  The climax is enjoyable if one of able to make sense of it.  Some people will look at it and say, ""Wow look at all the pretty spaceships!""  Maybe Speilberg was trying to entertain and mystify us for two hours, which he does at certain momements.  I guess what he's trying to say is, ""Aliens are not harmful.  They are here to make peace with us.""  But at the end, when the gigantic spaceship rises behind Devil's Tower, the only thing I was thinking was, ""Wow the only thing bigger than that spaceship is Speilberg's ego!""",1021680000,4,1320,4.561702127659575
10428,5,076780192X,"I am not a sci-fi fan.  At all.  But i just saw ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" on DVD and I loved it.  Maybe not Spielberg's finest (""Schindler's List"" takes the cake), it's definitely one of his best.
The setting is rural Indiana.  Our main character is one Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a struggling electrician who is contacted by aliens and travels to Devil's Tower to meet them.  Accompanying Roy is a distraught mother (Melinda Dillon), whose little son was ""kidnapped"" by the aliens.  But also heading to Devil's Tower is a band of government researchers led by a French scientist named Lacombe (Francious Traffaut).
In all, this is an amazing movie.  Filled with great acting and mind-blowing special effects, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is truly a masterpiece.  And a magical John Williams score only makes it better.",1018483200,,841,4.914893617021277
10429,5,076780192X,"Director Steven Spielberg's classic 1977 follow-up to ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" stars Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary.  Neary's just an ordinary blue collar guy, a bit of a dreamer with a taste for Disney films and miniature railroads... until he witnesses a spectacular UFO appearance.  Haunted by mental images of a mountain he's never seen before, Neary risks his job, his marriage, his sanity and, eventually, his life to uncover what it all means.

""Close Encounters"" also marks the first appearance of the Spielberg formula.  You know, the messy suburban house, the mouthy kids, the whole ""just plain folks involved with something magical"" storyline.  And while he gets a lot of knocks, both justified and unjustified, for inflicting this on American movies in the 80s, Spielberg's use of documentary-like elements throughout (as the space people play some Burmuda Triangle-related tricks on what's apparently an international investigation team) and some funky casting (Teri Garr, French director Francois Truffaut, Bob Balaban and others) combine to lend this one a veracity some of his later films- and those of his imitators- sometimes lack.  This is a very fresh and original take on sci-fi subject matter, completely without physical violence (although there is some of the emotional kind).  Seeing decades later after so many heartless, bombastic, noise and light CGI fests, one can't help but admire Spielberg's ability to get to the emotional core of this material.

Plus, it helps that the cutesy elements are kept to a minimum.  There's Melinda Dillon as a single mom whose oh-so-adorable-with-his-big-eyes kid gets kidnapped by the UFOs; the scene is played for scares, rather than laughs and it is genuinely terrifying.  Neary's kids are mostly unpleasant, and gone after the halfway point.  Dreyfuss downplays Neary's potential drippyness and plays up his frustration and rage as circumstances overwhelm him.  And Garr is very believable as Neary's doubtful wife; she keeps the character from becoming a one-note shrew.  You actually sympathize with her as she deals with what she thinks is her husband's selfish midlife crisis.

The film ends with an amazing sequence of events and actually takes on an epic scope without losing the human element that makes it all so enjoyable.  This DVD release follows the format from the recent ""Jaws"" disk:  a gorgeous widescreen print, a few deleted scenes, some documentaries.  A handsome release.

Look for Lance Henrickson in a small role.  He'd later appear as one of the Mercury 7 in ""The Right Stuff,"" and investigate the unknown on ""Millenium.""  And Carl ""Apollo Creed"" Weathers as a National Guardsman!",1015286400,,2687,5.248243559718969

This early effort is even more idiotic than most of his more recent, half-hearted efforts. This film is an incredibly boring, almost plotless, overlong borefest that may well cure you of insomnia by boring you to death. Also, a special note to the manufacturers of this disk: This is the 21st century! We want more than just some sorry movie on the disk. If all we the public wanted was the movie we would gladly buy the VHS. For your next release, try putting some worthwhile extra features on the disk. At least then you might be able to trick the public into thinking they are getting something worth the money they paid.",1014076800,12,832,4.480263157894737
10457,5,076780192X,"I just got done watching this for the third time.  The first two times, I had seen it on TV, and kept getting interrupted.  Either by people talking so that I couldn't hear, or having to leave the TV and missing scenes.  So, when I finally got to sit down and watch this straight through, I was blown away like it was the first time.
This is one of those movies that you can watch no matter what mood you are in, and end up feeling good.  This DVD contains the best version of it, too.  There was an original and a special edition.  The special edition cut out the scene of Roy Neary (Dreyfuss) tearing up his yard and throwing dirt and stuff in his window for a scene of him breaking down in the bathroom.  Personally, I find the first scene to be more interesting and entertaining, but the second is more vital to the story because it shows that he thinks he's going nuts and so does his family.  But, not to worry because BOTH scenes are spliced into the movie.  Also, the SE had and extended ending of Neary in the spaceship which isn't spliced into this one.
This movie, no matter how many times you see it, holds you spellbound.  Everyone was brilliant in this.  Speilberg's directing, Dreyfuss's acting (his performance in Jaws was damn good, but nothing compared to this), Terri Garr's acting, John Williams' musical score (somebody give him a lifetime achievement award, or better yet, three), and Paul Schrader-that's right, Paul Schrader's-brilliant screenplay.  Yep, the man who brought you such masterpieces as Taxi Driver as wrote this.  Speilberg rewrote it so much, though (probably because it was too dark, as Schrader's work tends to be), and Schrader said he didn't want anything to do with the new script.  Regardless of who wrote it, it's perfect and entertaining as all hell.
You would think that a movie of this caliber, with such a climactic and intense ending, would lose it's power to leave you staring at the screen in awe, but it doesn't.  During the whole last half of the movie (the close encounter and the events leading up to it), I was not only riveted, I was anxious and nervous.  Just like the first time I saw it.  I was doing all those nasty habits I do when I get anxious or nervous, even though I KNEW what was going to happen.  That's how friggin POWERFUL this movie is.  Everyone knows the basic plot to this movie, but it doesn't matter.  It spins it web over you, and you can't help but get caught in it every time.
Now, about the DVD.  Whoever put this DVD together is almost as brilliant as the people who made the movie.  It's 11 deleted scenes show you everything that was taken out of the movie (the extending ending, etc.), and then some.  The 100 minute(!) documentary is fascinating, if it had been any shorter(like those twenty minute ones, or even worse, one of those 7 minute ""featurettes"") I would have been mad as hell.  Again, hats off to whoever made it.  It also includes a featurette called Watch the Skies, which I admit that I haven't got around to yet, because I've been busy with the other features, and of course watching the movie!  But even if the featurette wouldn't have been included at all, the documentary more than makes up for it.  The DVD also includes trailers, which no one really cares about usually, but I always get a kick out of them.  The best thing about this, though, is the restored picture and sound.  The Dolby 5.1 sounds even better than the original sound!!!  And the picture is a million times better than VHS!  Definitely a noticeable difference!!
Oh yeah, the reason for my title is of course because this movie makes you use your brain, but it also leaves you feeling good after you watched with wonder as the close encounter unfolded.
Let me just say that this is one of the best sci-fi movies.  Except most of it isn't a sci-fi movie, so you don't need to be a sci-fi nut to enjoy it!!  This DVD NEEDS to be in your collection!!!",1013990400,6,3924,4.4739803094233475
10458,4,076780192X,"There's been a raging argument since this film's release back in the late 70's: which is the better science fiction film, STAR WARS or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND?
I think those who've engaged that argument have been going about debate much the wrong way, for there are really no similarities in these two pictures except for the fact that both includes aliens and otherworldly craft ... but the comparison really stops there.
After its initial release, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS enjoyed a second release not much later with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS: THE SPECIAL EDITION, which added footage cut and/or reshot to make the film a bit closer to visionary Steven Spielberg's dream picture.  The added footage, however, really was tacked onto the end of the film, giving viewers a glance inside the Mothership of the UFOs that have been haunting Earth.
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND: THE SPECIAL EDITION is an amalgam of the two films, preserving the best essence of the two pictures by creating one complete whole.
Perhaps the greatest nod to this film is that there would be no THE X FILES without this film having been made.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS paved the way found countless variations on the theme of extraterrestrial contact.  In fact, Spielberg himself had initially dubbed E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL as the unofficial sequel to CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, but he changed his mind last minute as the two films really have very little linkage.
This two-disc compilation boasts an excellent digitally mastered (audio and visual) product along with Dolby DTS and Dolby 5.1.  The second disc includes a Making of Documentary that gives some valuable history to the picture as well as commenting seriously on the films of Spielberg as a whole.  The deleted scenes add little to a film that already holds a complete rung on the ladder of the film industry.",1013472000,,1834,4.960912052117264
10459,5,076780192X,"Saw this one in the theater on my tenth birthday, and it was the most amazing movie I had ever seen up to that point, more amazing even than ""Star Wars"", which came out the same year.
I remember my Dad lamenting to my Mom when we got home that night, ""There wasn't any real violence in it... just a cop car crashing."" Many people like my Dad probably thought this film just wasn't for adults. After all, it was a feel-good, non-violent film with a wide-eyed little kid in it, and nobody (except the cop in the car wreck), really got hurt. The aliens were cute and friendly, too.
Some people, like Dad, have naturally made the mistake over the years of thinking that ""Close Encounters"" was just a kid's movie. But that was never so; if you take a close look, you'll see a very serious, intellegent film. There are really spooky, frightening moments that kids may or may not understand. Who can watch the abduction sequence or the Neary's encounter at the train crossing, and still say this was a kid's movie?
Watching this film again, in pristine DVD clarity, reminded me of just how little talent and creativity remains in Hollywood these days. As awesome as the effects in ""Close Encounters"" were (and still are), they never overpower the human element. Today, sci-fi is filled with a glut of pointless CGI, explosions, cleavage, mindless action, and violence, in place of real human characters interacting. How refreshing to look back and see a film from a simpler, more idealistic time when ideas and original concepts still exited!
I thought back to all the films and TV shows that came out around the same time; ""Star Wars"", ""Silent Running"", ""Tron"", ""The Black Hole"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Space:1999"", ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Buck Rogers"". Heck, for that matter, even ""Damnation Alley"", and ""The Cat From Outer Space""! Whether you liked any of these projects or not, all of them were highly original and different, unlike the tripe being force-fed to fandom today.
The new, original documentary on the second disc is very, very informative, and included there are all the deleted scenes (I at long last found out whatever happened to that cop who crashed his car!), the ""Special Edition"" extra scenes, trailers, and an original featurette from 1977. Interviews include Spielberg, Douglas Trumbull, Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon, Bob Balaban, composer John Williams, the actor who played the child Barry (Cary Guffey), and others. Also, it's funny to see a young, beardless Spielberg!
This DVD version of the film keeps some of the Special Edition extra scenes added after the film was originally released in 1977, and the result is the best of both worlds. The film clearly states that, although the unknown may be frightening at first, we may not really have anything to fear.
Best of all, we wisely do not follow Neary into the ship.",1012780800,2,2851,4.844262295081967
10460,2,076780192X,"I vividly remember seeing ""CE3K"" as a teenager and I especially remember the ads with the long stretch of highway and the ominous quote ""We are not alone!"". Seeing the film 25 years later makes me wonder what all the fuss was about. This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most overated films. It resembles a tv mini-series, long and plodding, and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions. I'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it! As with many early Spielberg films, there are lots of noisy, irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia. After a long hour and a half, these people finally make it to Devil's Tower, where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans. This sequence is still dazzling, but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show. And, oh yes, that five note tone gets really irritating by the end of the movie!
I was disappointed with the quality of the dvd as well. There is a highly noticable ""shimmering"" in the interogation scene between Dreyfess and the government agents. Also, the night sky scenes looked uneven with streaks of gray overlapping the blacks. Many scenes were ""soft"" and uneven.

Playing the same discs on a different DVD player and television produced the same results.  I can only assume that mine is not the only CLOSE ENCOUNTERS DVD with this flaw, and I am surprised that the quality control folks at Columbia Pictures did not catch this problem and correct it before shipping the product.

10463,5,076780192X,Steven Spielberg went all the way with this cut of CE3K.

10465,5,076780192X,"Nearly a quarter century since it was unleashed, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND ranks as one of the supreme cinematic achievements of the modern era.  Steven Spielberg wrote and directed this tremendous science fiction film with his own distinctive middle-class view on things.
Richard Dreyfuss is at his usual terrific best in the role of Ron Neary, another of Spielberg's ""Everyman"" characters.  He is an Indiana power lineman who is called out on a night where the entire city of Muncie goes dark.  Then, at a railroad crossing, he is suddenly shocked by the appearance of a UFO, flooding him with brilliant white light.  This encounter soon turns both him and his life upside down; his wife (Teri Garr) and kids can't understand his obsession with turning the shape of mashed potatoes or mounds of dirt from his backyard into a mysterious mountain he's been seeing in his mind.  Meanwhile, a lonely mother (Melinda Dillon) has her own close encounters with the UFOs, resulting in the still-unseen aliens abducting her son (Cary Guffey).  She too has visions of a mysterious mountain, visions which find their way into paintings and colorings.
When the news comes on TV with word that a train supposedly loaded with deadly nerve gases has overturned in northeastern Wyoming, however, both Dreyfuss and Dillon know the locale--Devils Tower.  In spite of government officials closing the park off to outsiders (the nerve gas leak is an elaborate cover story), Dreyfuss and Dillon witness, along with a noted UFO expert (Francois Truffaut, director of the 1969 classic THE WILD CHILD) and hundreds of others, the first actual close encounter of the third kind--direct physical contact between Earthlings and extra-terrestrials.
Spielberg's film was obviously a radical shift from most previous Hollywood depictions about outer space visitations to Earth.  He evokes the famous line ""Watch The Skies"" from Howard Hawks' 1951 classic THE THING, but does so without the paranoia and hysteria of the space invasion films of the 1950s.  There are no lasers or bug-eyed monsters.
Because CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was made after America's twin debacles with Vietnam and Watergate, it takes a low-key but rather apparent questionable view of the military and the government--as Stephen King put in his book ""Danse Macabre"", a ""don't-let-the-military handle this"" approach.  In its scope and approach, this movie is closer, in a middle-class way, to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which Spielberg has always numbered among his favorites, than to any sci-fi film of the past.  Dreyfuss and Dillon are excellent in their roles, as is Truffaut; and as for John Williams' score...what more needs to be said; it's brilliant.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (also known as CE3K) won an Oscar for Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography, though four other men (William Fraker, Douglas Slocombe, John Alonzo, Laszlo Kovas) are also credited.
Well conceived, suspenseful, occasionally terrifying, and finally uplifting, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is yet one more staggering masterpiece for a director with a whole lot of masterpieces still to come.",1008288000,7,3097,5.259634888438134

While the book sticks to the facts and doesn't jump to conclusions, the same can't be said for the movie. All goes ""according to plan"" until the ending-- when for some reason they decided to toss the book out and write a sappy ending. I guess the director felt it would be more entertaining that way.

I rate my movies in the following manner: Believeability of the script and acting. Interesting subject matter. And how well each acter is introduced in a way we know the nature of the character. In many movies, I require at least one good nude scene of the female character to add to the introduction.(Of course this is not the case in all the movies I like) However it is always a plus point.

But we watched it with our kids (13 & 8) in the year 2000 and they hated it, and frankly, I dozed off myself. Science fiction is the hardest genre to keep fresh for generations, for obvious reasons, but some core elements of film-making never go out of style.
It feels so self-important and plodding. The pace is slow and the special effects no longer have the power to stun. And the movie doesn't really surprise.  There is no ultimate mystery to the plot.  Yes, one might wonder what the aliens are like, but we never doubt that they're there, that Dreyfuss will get to see them and that nothing bad will happen.  The movie never builds up any truly engrossing tension.  We feel safe throughout, and wouldn't you think that the world, getting ready to see aliens for the first time, would feel more frightened (and the viewer more frightened)?
It's fun to hear the ""alien theme"" music again, and Richard Dreyfuss is very good. But Francois Truffaut?? Why did Speilberg cast him?

10506,5,076780192X,"I personally think this is one of Spielbergs greatest movies. Melding the wonder of the unknown with high adventure, it still gives me goose bumps 24 years later. Sure some of the effects look a little dated and the 70's hair do's are a distraction but look at the heart of the story and you see a classic.",1001289600,,306,4.293103448275862
10507,4,076780192X,"The most telling thing about ""Close Encounters"" is that it's been out for a quarter of a century, and even Steven Spielberg doesn't feel he's *quite* gotten it right yet.  The 2001 DVD print is the ""Collector's Edition"", and is not the same as the version you remember from the movie theater, cable television, or the laserdisc (depending on how you were first introduced to the film).
As with Spielberg's later ""A.I."" (also generally regarded as a misfire), this is a darker science-fiction fable than you'd expect from the director.  The sense of discovery and wonder is present from start to finish, in images and pictures if not so much in words.  The UFO display lighting up the pitch-black Indiana sky, or soaring over the Devil's Tower, haunted my dreams for years, just from seeing the TV trailers at a young age, long before I'd watched the movie.  From that stand point ""Close Encounters"" is one of our most enduring films.
Less well-remembered is Richard Dreyfuss's role as Roy Neary, a man whose life is quite literally torn apart by his encounter and subsequent visions.  Almost unbelievably for a Spielberg film, Neary's marriage does't survive the film (Terri Garr does at least lends unexpected depth to what could have been a thankless role), and we're left wondering if he'll be reunited with his three children -- or if Roy Neary really cares?  The one family scene before his close encounter shows that he's pretty well alienated from his home to begin with.  Was he happy with his life before the flying saucers found him?  Will he ever return to Earth?  What does Spielberg mean by that U.S.S. Enterprise hanging in Roy's living room? :-)
The film is rife with Spielberg's great cinematic signatures and humorous touches (the UFOs, who are first mistaken for a truck pulling up behind Roy's vehicle, lift up and fly *over* him, but he's too busy reading a map to notice).  The final half-hour of the film is virtually dialogue free -- at least, in this particular edition -- and ends in a show of lights that mirrors the look of ""2001""'s last segment, if lacking in that earlier film's impact.
The DVD transfer is, as others have said, a joy to watch.  The special features are a bit repetitive -- the making-of documentary is nearly as long as the movie -- and not all the footage from all the versions of the movie have been incorporated.
Most Spielberg fans will not find this to be his most cohesive work.  Indeed, one day Spielberg may return to the picture yet again.  But the physical package is impressive, and the 4 hours you spend with these discs are 4 hours that you don't need to spend watching ""A.I.""",1000598400,6,2636,4.691973969631237

But that is the original version not the sanitized special edition. If Steven Spielberg is such a great filmmaker, than why did he recut the original? He destroyed the emotional ending by inserting Richard Dreyfuss hyperventilating as he enters the mothership. And he suspiciously removed the scene which accused the government of covering up their knowledge of UFO's and how people are looked upon as crazy for their beliefs. So, Mr. Spielberg continues to censor his original masterpiece. Why? I have rated the original. Please search it out.

10512,5,076780192X,"I am not the biggest fan of Spielberg. He might be thought of as one of Hollywood's sacred cows, but not everything he's done has turned to gold. A regrettable example of that would be ...Batteries Not Included in 1987. He has done his share of stinkers as well, but Close Encounters of the Third Kind, even more so than E.T., in my opinion, is his crowning achievement. I guess I have a bias towards Close Encounters as far as Spielberg films goes because it gives me such fine reminders of my early childhood (I was just five years old when it hit the theatres in November 1977). Trust me on this, this is one creepy film. Especially the special effects and the fact a lot of it was set at night, giving one the creepy feeling that one might encounter of UFO. Enough has been already said of the film that hasn't been already said. The film involves Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) who keeps having a recurring vision of Devil's Tower in Wyoming, which he is so compelled to go there that it ruined his marriage with Ronnie (Teri Garr). Devil's Tower was the location where Roy will encounter the giant mothership and communicate with the aliens. There are at least a couple of versions of this film. There was the theatrical version where Roy communicates with the aliens in the spaceship at the end but that's it. And then there's the 1980 Special Edition where you actually see the interior of the UFO that Roy went in to. I have seen both versions, so I should know. When you're younger, you mostly enjoy the movie for the visual effects and the fact you got to see aliens at the end (which look very similar to the ""Greys"" that real life people said they encountered when they were supposedly abducted by aliens). When you're older, you'll find out the movie has a lot of cover-ups and conspiracies involved as to why the area around Devil's Tower was evacuated (truly a treat for those who listen to Art Bell's radio program). It took me so long to figure out what was up with those fighter planes found in the desert, those were the ones that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in December 1945 (several months after WWII ended). If it was any movie that was perfect to watch at the drive-ins back in the 1970s, Close Encounters was truly that one movie. I am not much for Hollywood movies, because so much of it is so hyped and commercialized, or so mediocre, but this is truly amazing and needs to be seen.",998265600,3,2415,4.46606334841629

And would they be hostile or friendly?
Steven Spielberg's film has defied dating.  Although the time and place are the same, the messages are universal and do not grow less with age.  And Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary, American Everyman, hasn't been better before or since, in my opinion.  Plus, the film boasts the legendary Francois Truffaut.  The special effects, amazing for the day, continue to jawdrop.
The sound and picture quality are flawless, especially the DTS track, which resonates with the voices of the otherworldly.  The documentary, culled from the laserdisc version, is excellent, and even better than a commentary.  It offers insight into the making of one of the most important science fiction films ever made.

10524,5,076780192X,"Strange things are happening around the world; things that challenge the imagination and open the mind to possibilities almost beyond imagining.  Things that only director Steven Spielberg can explain, which he does in his monumental epic of man's encounter with alien life, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""  Planes lost in WWII suddenly appear in a Mexican desert; a long lost ship turns up in the middle of the Gobi Desert; and in Dharmsala, Northern India, hundreds of people are gathered together, singing--a short ""tune"" that consists of a mere five notes, over and over, repeatedly.  When they are asked where they heard this tune, the throng, as one, dramatically thrust their hands into the air and point to the sky.  And, indeed, in the skies all around the world, strange things are happening.
And even as these events are transpiring, one evening in Muncie, Indiana, the city is suddenly blacked out by an inexplicable power outage.  Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is at home when it hits, and he is called in by the power company for which he works, then sent out in the darkness to an unfamiliar location.  Lost, he sits in his pick-up truck at a railroad crossing, studying a map, when all at once he notices a ""disturbance"" around him.  Mailboxes along the side of the road are clanging open and shut by themselves; then things inside his truck begin to move, subtly at first, then erupting and flying about as if caught up in a tornado--and then just as suddenly his truck is engulfed in a blinding light.  He leans out the window for a look, but it's too bright and he has to pull back.  Then just as abruptly, it all stops-- the disturbance, the light-- everything.  And he looks out the window again; but this time he sees something.  And though he doesn't realize it at the time, at that moment, his life changed forever.
In this wonderfully realized, highly imaginative film that is extremely well crafted and presented by Spielberg, he takes you along with Roy in the days that follow that strange occurrence in Muncie.  Roy becomes lost in thought, drifting, unable to focus on anything, much to the consternation of his wife, Ronnie (Teri Garr).  But he can't help himself; something-- an image-- has begun to form in his mind.  He has no idea what it is or what it means, but it becomes an obsession, and slowly it begins to take shape:  First in a handful of shaving cream, then in a plate of mashed potatoes, which he piles up and begins to sculpt with his fork, while Ronnie and his kids look on in bewilderment.  But he can see it in his mind, and it's like a mountain-- a mountain shaped like a ""tower.""  And Roy isn't the only one.  Around the world, others are being drawn to the same image in their minds, and it's a force that compels them, pushing them on to find whatever it is, a power so strong in cannot be denied or refused.  They know only one thing:  Whatever it is, it's important, and they have no choice but to follow where it may lead.  And it becomes a great adventure, one in which they discover what Man has long suspected:  We are not alone.
Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as Neary, a regular guy-- he could be your neighbor or the man who comes to install your phone-- and gives a thoroughly convincing, introspective performance while creating a character with whom it is easy to relate and through whom you are able to share this unique adventure.  Garr does a good job, as well, as Ronnie, the wife concerned with her husband's sudden and seemingly bizarre behavior, someone with whom you can certainly sympathize.  Dillon delivers, too, as the single mother who suddenly finds herself caught up in these inexplicable and extraordinary events, and also turning in a memorable performance is the young Cary Guffey, as Barry, Jillian's son, who makes his own connection with the other-worldly visitors.
The supporting cast includes Francois Truffaut (Lacombe), Bob Balaban (Laughlin) and Lance Henriksen (Robert).  An uplifting, positive motion picture, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is thoroughly entertaining, as well as thought provoking.  Spielberg draws you in as few filmmakers can, with a great story and with characters who are readily accessible and with whom it is easy to identify-- all of which adds up to an absorbing, memorable and enjoyable experience, and a perfect example of the real magic of the movies.",996105600,,4388,4.74078947368421

Also, the documentary on this disk is incredible.  It is much more thorough (and seems to be a longer version) than the one that was included on the recent VHS release.

But in retrospect this film followed an era in which an idealistic generation, once devoted to social change and the immortalization of its own youth culture, had to settle for the latter of the two possibilities.  The ""story"" represents not just an escape from the banality of middle-class values but from responsibilities, conflicts, risky human relationships, and life itself.

Out of all the great sci-fi and adventure films of the late '70s and early '80s, I always liked CE3K the best. The best quality of Steven Spielberg has always been his ability to provoke a sense of wonder, and nowhere is that more evident than here.  We marvel along with the characters at the strange happenings of the early movie, and Dreyfuss and company convey perfectly the astonishment of the breathtaking mothership.

Spielberg came up with the novel idea that perhaps ""invading"" aliens needn't be hostile. Nevertheless communication between alien species can't be easy. They don't quite know how to go about contacting us and become a bit of a 'bull in a china shop.' Their methods are inexplicable and cause somewhat of a tumult on Earth, but that's why they're aliens, right? We're not the same. Why should we expect them to think the same as we do, with the same respect for personal boundaries and behavior? The complexity that went into the creation of the aliens' behavior and culture is one of the things that makes this movie so interesting.
Richard Dreyfuss, still spry and angst-ridden in his youth, is terrific as Roy Neary, an electrician whose contact with the aliens leads him to obsession and ruins his domestic life.
Of course, the most enjoyable scene in the movie is the first real contact between humanity and the aliens with the best part of the musical score on display.
The only thing missing on this DVD is the option to view the movie INCLUDING the missing scenes like the ones aboard the spacecraft.

10547,4,076780192X,"Like several other reviewers, I am something of a Close Encounters connoisseur, having viewed every different cut of this movie since the original 1977 release.  My least favorite, by far, was the so-called ""Special Edition"" that was released in 1980 and for years was the only version available for home viewing.  I always felt that the deletion of certain scenes from that version made the story difficult to follow and the flow of the movie somewhat choppy.  The shot of Dreyfuss inside the Mother Ship killed much of the mystery and wonder that surrounded the ending in the original cut.  When the movie was aired on network TV back in the early 80's, a complete version was shown, including all of the original '77 footage and the additional ""Special Edition"" scenes edited together.  With the exception of the scene inside the spacecraft, this version would have to be my favorite.  As a fan, I feel like I'm getting the complete Close Encounters experience when I watch this cut of the film.  In every other version, somehow I feel cheated when a scene, or even a quick camera shot, is missing.  In 1990, Criterion released a laser disc version of this film that included all the footage.  My hope was that the ""Collector's Edition,"" as this DVD edition is called, would also include the ""complete"" film.  While the Collector's Edition is a vast improvement over the Special Edition, I still find myself wishing that a few extra scenes could have been included in the main feature.  I always felt that the scene showing Neary at the power plant was necessary to explain to the viewer why he's out in the middle of nowhere looking for downed power lines.  This is on Disc 2 as a deleted scene, but without this short scene included in the main feature it requires the viewer to make an a cognitive jump in regard to the story-line, and is actually quite confusing to the first-time viewer.  Another deletion (that's not included on Disc 2) is where Neary ""sees"" the mysterious shape in a pillow at home.  Later in the film he refers to this previous vision, but since the scene referred to has been deleted in this version, it doesn't have the full impact on the viewer that it could.  There's a few other minor exclusions that die-hard fans will wish were on there.  Fortunately, Spielberg deceided NOT to include the interior shot of the spacecraft in the main feature, so the mystery remains (not to mention the end of the film flows a lot better without this additional scene, in my opinion).  I still feel the Criterion release on laser disc is superior, at least from a content perspective.  You had the option of watching the original '77 cut that was released in theaters, the 1980 ""Special Edition,"" or a complete cut of the movie with all scenes, all depending on how you programmed your laser disc player.  Perhaps Criterion will see fit to re-release this movie on DVD using the same format as their previous laser disc set.
In conclusion, I feel this cut (the ""Collector's Edition"") is excellent, the transfer seems good, and the documantary and extras on Disc 2 are a real treat.  Nevertheless, truly die-hard fans will find themselves wanting a slightly more complete cut of the film.",992390400,17,3205,4.719928186714542

Simalar (but better designed) packaging used for ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and the 2 disc version of ""Boogie Nights"" would have been a better choice all-around.

10549,5,076780192X,"It's easy to take this movie for granted, now that so much of it is embedded in the public consciousness. But maybe that's why Close Encounters of the Third Kind earned its #64 spot on the AFI top 100 ranking. It's a mystery story infused with real life with shades of quite plausible science fiction. And, that all being said, human relationships are the focus here.

Dreyfuss is a normal man living a normal life. Alien spaceships, visually beautiful, begin visiting far-flung locations on Earth. They are revered by some, while others are threatened, and yet others refuse to accept it's happening. It's not that there are Good Guys or Bad Guys. It is more how all of us react to a knowledge which is new and strange. Do we hide from it? Embrace it? If you're a mother, do you let your child get drawn off by these unknown creatures? The movie does a great job of showing all sides, how the aliens *might* be friendly - or they *might* be a threat. How can one know? The government is trying to get a handle on things without causing a panic. Is that a proper response? Anyone who's seen the TV series 24 knows how tricky that type of decision can be.

Garr plays Dreyfuss's wife, who while skeptical, does also try her best to understand him. She goes with him to the press conference. But to her it's as if he claims to have seen the loch ness monster. He's already lost his job over this. How about her kids? How much can she let her husband's ""bizarre behavior"" affect them? When he flings a heavy plant through a window and at her head, and starts ranting while stealing fencing from his neighbors, many would say she's quite right in taking her kids to safety.

Then there's Dillon, who plays the mom of a young boy who is taken away. She is determined to get her child back. So while Garr runs away with her kids to protect them, Dillon teams up with Dreyfuss to get hers back. When Dreyfuss is falling back on the mountain, it's Dillon who kicks him into gear. I did find it a bit iffy that a short while later Dreyfuss gives her a fairly warm kiss on the mouth. How quickly he forgets his wife. And kids. And it's also a bit strange that Dillon, knowing her son is probably with the aliens, doesn't want to go too. If I was a mom and my kid was in there, I'd be heading down to get on board right alongside Dreyfuss.

It's amusing that some of the alien music ends up sounding Jaws-y.

The government does send two females in their nearly all-white-male submission to the aliens. And the movie features the two women in the cast showing two different points of view - the one who shies away from the aliens for her kids and the one who goes towards the aliens for her kid. But really, 99% of the movie is about men. The two women never talk to each other and barely see each other as they pass in one scene. Dreyfuss has one woman to take care of his kids, another woman to empathize with his dreams, and it doesn't seem like he gives his family even a passing glance before he hops the next spaceship out of there. He created those three kids - but he was apparently ""meant for so much more"". They annoy him with their talk of fractions and mini-golf.

And one has to say, if the aliens can figure out our long/lat system and have advanced physics, surely they could learn English in a week or two of monitoring our TV signals and simply talk with us. Not nearly as much fun as teaching us slowpokes an entirely new musical language.

So yes, as much as this positions itself as the intellectual counterpart to Star Wars, it's still not as tightly written as many other movies out there. That's all right. It's more an artistic romantic vision than an intellectual examination. This is a man's fantasy about escape. He has women to care for the various aspects of his life, he has the freedom to escape, and he goes. He throws caution to the wind and hops on that space-schooner into the unknown. It gets kudos for its portrayal of that simple desire to head off towards the horizon, and its presentation of aliens as a pleasant rather than dangerous force.

Well recommended.",992390400,,4089,4.378129117259552

What strikes me about this version is what it is lacking.  It is a well know fact that Spielberg regreted filming the inside-the-ship segment inserted into the Special Edition.  But in all fairness, it should have been included in the deleted-scenes portion of the special features.  There were numerous other scenes that could also have been included in the same way. Regardless of some interesting supplemental material, the Laser Disc version had so much more, and also included many versions of scenes that had been removed or changed.

10588,4,076780192X,"I had forgotten how good this movie was until I got it on DVD.  Richard Dreyfuss puts in a great performance as Roy Neary.  His portrayal of the subtle changes his character goes through throughout the movie, from child like enthusiasm, to outright obsession, is spot on.  Francois Truffaut also puts in an outstanding performance.  This is the movie that established Spielberg's kind of ""awe/woundrous"" style of filmaking.  You know, like the spaceships in Close Encounters, E.T., Indiana Jones' adventures, the first glimpse of a dinosaur in the Jurassic series, he just stages some wonderfull awe inspiring scenes.
I really like how this movie is made.  It's not so much about the aliens as it is about the people, namely Roy, who they touch somehow.  How these people become obsessed with UFOs or whatever.  As for the UFOs themselves, Speilberg teases us with small sighting near the beginning of the film, a tense scene at the house of the little boy, and some finds of missing planes and ships.  Other than those few scenes, it's more about the characters and you don't really see much about the aliens until the big pay off scene at the end.  And as for that scene, it's worth the buildup.  Even 20 some odd years after the movie came out, with the advancement of special effects and everyting, the climax still manages to be awe inspiring.
The extras are great as well.  Some really good deleted scenes here, about 11 in all, some dealing with the chaos of Roy doing his work when the power goes out, some dealing with Roy's obsession with the sky and the infamous inside the spaceship ending that was in the Special Edition.  I also really like the scene with the policemen filing their reports.  A couple of old trailers for the movie, it's interesting to see how they advertised their movies back in the day.  And my favorite, the in depth documentary.  This baby is as long as a movie by itself and it has tons of info on the movie, everying you wanna know.  I love it when a disc goes all out on a documentary, as I find the behind the scenes stuff, the stories to be told and the looking back on stuff intriguing.  This movie whets my appetite for Spielberg DVDs for now, much like Jurassic Park and Jaws did when they came out.  But like those movies, it won't be long before I crave MORE Spielberg on DVD!

10589,5,076780192X,"This movie is why DVD players were invented!  I remember seeing this in the theater 24 years ago and not quite understanding what it meant (I was only 7).  The 1980 re-release added a couple of scenes including the ticket-selling final sequence inside the mother ship.
The DVD version of Close Encounters contains neither the original version nor the Special Edition.  Instead, DVD owners are treated to the ""Directors Cut"" that ""...can be seen and enjoyed as he has always intended..."".  This basically means that the sequence inside the mother ship is cut out (a sequence he never wanted to do anyway) and a few scenes that were included in the original were put back (including a favorite scene of mine of Roy taking plants and fencing from the neighbors to build his mountain).
I personally love this director's cut.  I must admit my initial viewing ended in disappointment when the final mother ship sequence had been removed.  After watching the phenomenal documentary on disc 2, I understand why it was taken away (you can still view the scene as part of the ""deleted scenes"" portion of disc 2).
The documentary really gives the view a renewed appreciation of what it took to make this film.
We've waited a long time for this DVD and it doesn't disappoint.  It deserves 5 stars (though it would have been even better had it included the parody, ""Closet Cases of the Nerd Kind"").",991612800,8,1385,4.745833333333334
10590,5,076780192X,"This is actually the third edition of Close Encounters, and could be considered the director's cut. For the special edition, Spielberg had to make some promises to Columbia about showing the &#8220;inside of the ship&#8221; before they would give him the money to &#8220;finish&#8221; a film he had to rush into the can because of the studio's budgetary problems in 1977 (watch the included documentary). The result is breath taking. It will ruin you for all the ...expensive film currently washing through theatres in the U.S. (no names &#8211; I'm sure by now everyone has their favorite stinker for this year, even though it's only June).
This was not a cheap movie. Many effects, including Spielberg's trademark use of  &#8220;cloud tank&#8221; skies were perfected for this film. Not everything worked the first or fourth time they tried it. Columbia ran low on money while Spielberg was polishing off the second edit, replete with footage added. I argue that he just did not want to stop touching his movie until he was forced to. My proof is that there are currently three versions of this film, two of which have additional footage that was added by Spielberg after BOTH 1st and second unit were wrapped up.
This is not Spielberg's magnum opus: I believe that is in the future. As a director he is growing and changing and building on all those glorious films he has given to the world, rushing towards a pinnacle that will change film forever. Not all of them worked. This one did. The result is what our parents used to experience in a dark theatre years ago when people's lives changed based on what flickered before them on a silver screen. Magic. And for just shy of three hours, this magic will be yours again, in your homes, with your families, for as long as your VCR or DVD functions.
A truly great artist understands that people want to dream, and be lifted into worlds away from those familiar, if only for a little while. Spielberg is a truly great artist. This was his third film.",991267200,,2001,4.717142857142857

The digital remastering was fantastic, but I can't understand why the Special Edition wasn't the feature. The Special Edition, especially with the inside-the-ship scenes, far outweighs the original. Also, there are other scenes which should have been left in instead of being shown on the Deleted Scenes on Disc 2. Roy Neary getting the assignment from the power plant and getting bad directions was critical to his first encounter. Also, the scene where he first sees the mound shape in the pillow is missing. My personal favorite, at the BBQ, when he gets everyone looking up has a fantastic dual meaning. He is looking up into the heavens and being worn out by the domestic boredom on Earth at the same time. Disc 2 saves this set. I have always wondered how Spielberg pulled this off. The Documentary is incredible. Over an hour and a half of inside info that makes viewing this movie even more enjoyable, if possible.

10593,5,076780192X,"I have recieved my new copy of the CE3K DVD, and am very pleased. As far as my review, it has been my favorite movie of all time, beginning with the first time I saw it on cable in the early eighties, at the age of 10. Star Wars and all stole my heart, but this one stole my mind. I like Amazon's reviewers comment that the movie is more about the drive of artistic expression than science-fiction, and generally I was more interested in the ""real-world vs the extraordinary"" story line than anything regarding UFOs.
The most impressive DVD addition are the deleted scenes, most of which I had never seen. What is so interesting is that they reveal answers to so many unseen questions and results regarding the sightings in the movie!
Did you wonder what ever happened after the ""AirEast 31"" landed? How about what was going on in Tolono? What the cops really thought about the UFO chase? What did Roy's neighbors think about his sighting? How did Roy and Jillian, while running from the Feds, ""get some gas and get down in there?"" These scenes, while not altogether vital, wouldve added even more interest to the fabric of the film. As deleted scenes, they are gems.
Among the scenes are several from the original release but not in the special edition or the collectors edition. These include the first part of Roy in the Power Plant and the scene in Wyoming with ""Appolo Creed"" Carl Weathers telling Roy that the Army shoots looters...The Mother Ship interior is also a deleted item. There is even a hilarious outtake with Truffaut and Balaban that certainly didn't make the first cut, and definitely shows Truffaut's humor! The fabulous documentary (an edited version is on the VHS tape) also includes outtakes, and hilarious production stories.
However, my only complaints were that there are even MORE deleted scenes that were not included:
The alternate intro to seeing Roys family with the Pinocchio figurine; The scene where the farmer on the road says ""We're years ahead of 'em on the highway'; Where Roy sees Devils Tower in the pillowcase; and Lacombe's standing ovation. There possibly were more, but that's from memory. These are minor, but are needed to complete the extras.
Also, to make this edition complete, a Music Score only track would have enhanced the role of John William's music, and of course, a commentary from Spielberg himself, but we all know he doesn't do that sort of thing. Maybe for the next ""Collector's Special Ultimate Edition""!",991180800,,2466,4.77751756440281

This scene is now among the 11 ""deleted scenes"" found on disc 2!
What's been restored/removed:  1) When Neary is followed by the UFO from his first encounter, the large ""shadow"" moving over him was removed - it was night-time afterall...  2) The ""shower scene"" restored for the 'Special Edition' is retained.  3) Roy gathering 'supplies' for his family room sculpture project is restored - including his encounter with the hairdryer wielding Mrs. Harris (Mary Gaffney).  4) When Ronnie Neary leaves for good, the roof-top platform is not seen - (1 of the deleted scenes on disc 2 involves this observatory 'deck')  5) At the end, when Roy Neary walks to his destiny, almost immediately the 'head alien' has her conversation with Francios Truffaut [eliminating the theory that Neary was 'changed into' an alien in preparation for space travel]

The original movie was excellent, don't see the need of any re-editing. I believe it's about money as Steven Spielberg's most movies are. Close Encounters was his last film as a director with innocent creativity that brought great movies like Duel, Sugarland Express, Jaws and Close Encounters. From my point of view, the new ending did hurt the movie.  The original one was very satisfying, presented just enough and left much more for our imagination. Obviously Spielberg wanted to re-done this movie in his in ""cheesed up, at times childish, big bang Hollywood style"" which is evident in duds like ET (artistically), Hook (financially).Just leave Close Encounters alone, perhaps make another ET (hope not)if he feels the need for more alien, sci-fi flicks.",990576000,4,885,5.103448275862069
10598,5,076780192X,"Steven Spielberg uses the concept of urban paranoia to dismantle it, to expose it and to denounce it. The intervention of extraterrestrials in our society starts a real panic among many people, and at the same type mesmerizes some who are invited in a way for the grand coming that is announced by this open show of power and benevolence. Then the film analyzes the reaction of authorities. Military authorities are obsessed by limiting the contact of these ETs with the population, hence they evacuate the area where the meeting is supposed to take place, they establish a whole fear and even fright process to convince the population that they must go away or stay away,and they constantly think of danger, instead of thinking of potential opening. On the other side the scientists, strangely dominated by a Frenchman, are jumping on the occasion to open their minds, to seize the day, the night and the new vistas that open up to them.
The capture of a child gives a tremendous sentimental and affective dimension to these contacts, because he does not know fear and only sees what it is for him : a contact with a new toyland, with new playmates. The whole deal is to surrender all the men the ETs have captured over the previous decades, and the equipment with which they had been captured, such as planes and boats, in exchange for a new batch of volunteers to go with them for exhanges and a visit to this extraterrestrial world. The suspense in the film is created by a man who was visited a couple of nights before on the road and who manages to go through all barriers and to impose himself on the trip, with the complicity of the Frenchman.
What is admirable in this film is that the ETs are shown as absolutely mature and our society, at a scientific level, as being ready to experiment, to take risks, to engulf in an adventure. It is a very positive approach to the problem and this is refreshing. Steven Spielberg manages to literally mesmerize us by organizing a real ballet of light and colors and music as the way these ETs can communicate with us (music and colored lights) and can demonstrate they power as well as their total un-agressiveness (the ballet of lights and beautiful movements  in the sky). He also evades the necessity to show the ETs by blurring their rather childish forms in a nearly blinding light. They are only shadows in this light, and this keeps some kind of mystery in the encounters.
This film is refreshing, optimistic and the perfect counterbalancing vision as opposed to the totally urban paranoid approach of many authors, the latest book on the subject being Steven King's Dreamcatcher. Here we understand we must not be afraid of them or their coming, because, and definitely more than us, they want to know, to exchange, to build together with us rather than destroy and annihilate.

It is hard to go into details about this film because it is so good. I will point out the infamous last 1/4 of the film. Using music as a way of communication is simply brilliant. It is an illustration that music is indeed the universal language along with math.

Because we can identify more with a middle-aged electrician than we can with a moisture farmer on a desert planet. Richard Dreyfuss is the aforementioned electrician, who has an extraterrestrial experience and suddenly is obsessed with these aliens. This epic is an excellent early work of Stephen and truly delights the senses as well as the mind, and is still extremely watchable today. Now, for the faults. It starts slow and never really builds to a frantic pace, but it only increases the suspense. Although the aliens are a little disappointing (just the basic pointy-eyed, almond faced stereotypes), these faults are easily compensated in this amazing experience.

Basically this movie is for those who wanna lie to themselves and say that there's nothing to worry about. 2001 is definitely the movie to see if your interested in aliens- im not saying it's real (who knows though?), but its sure more engaging than Close Encounters.",972259200,3,1358,5.04
10616,5,076780192X,"Great special effects are of course of value in science fiction but here the draw is really the characters.  I felt invested in each of the main characters and wanted to keep watching.  The music was haunting and well planned, adding wonderfully to the atmosphere of the story.  Might be too frightening for young children but not boring to non-science fiction fans since the focus is on what drives and pushes the characters.",972000000,,426,4.808219178082192
10617,5,076780192X,"This is a cult classic movie about an unexpected event - close encounters of the third kind. When it's on DVD, this is a must for your collection.",971136000,,146,4.25
10618,5,076780192X,"I would rate this as my favorite film ever! I've been waiting for this film to come out on DVD for ages, and am growing steadily impatient with the delay!  The Alien spaceships still stand up today to close scrutiny more than 20 years since the film was made, I hopnestly have to say that the film certainly doesn't show it's age!  The one thing you have to start watching out for with this film is that the people you let watch it, don't start making mountains out of their mashed potato, and please if you have an expensive living room and carpet make sure that any mud is kept well away!  Without doubt one of the best films ever to come out of the imagination of Steven Spielberg, the master of Science Fiction!",970617600,,715,4.32089552238806
10619,4,076780192X,"Without a doubt, one of Spielberg's best.  A clean, well-written movie  that blows away most alien contact flicks.  Science Fiction done with  respect and love for the genre.  Unfortunately, there are so many versions  of this film floating around that you'd better just wait and see what they  do with the DVD.  I for one hated the ""Special Edition"" and am  just as unimpressed with the Director's Cut.  There are still scenes  missing that need to be restored (including the '77 ending), and only DVD  can do the special effects and soundtrack justice.",968198400,5,554,4.838709677419355
10620,5,076780192X,Spielberg before his genius was realized and Dreyfuss before he was legendary. A story of two people among thousands touched by a vison they don't understand after encountering visitors from outer space.  A vison  that drives them in different ways for answers to questions they did not  know they were asking.  Overcoming obstacles placed in front of them by a  government trying to keep the secret the two separately seek answers to the  questions that could very well kill them.  One leaving his unbelieving wife  and family and the other looking for her recently abducted son they find  each other in their trek to Devil's Tower Wyoming to witness contact with  an alien species. With Academy Award winning Cinematography and sound  effects combined with amazing visual special effects and an truly moving  score by John Williams this is a movie that takes you out of your seat and  into the world of movies like no other before it.  A must have for anyone  who dreams.,955238400,3,973,4.8121212121212125
10621,4,076780192X,"An intriguing story of a man's quest for answers after he gets buzzed by UFOs late one night.  The movie progresses quickly and rarely lingers, and comes off as one of the more believable close encounter movies around.  It's more than just a sci-fi film, it's a look at what happens when a  person can't explain what's driving them forward.  Highly recommended  except for one flaw; the director's cut removes a few minutes of brilliant  footage of a man going nuts to stick on some fancy special effects.",952992000,3,505,4.681818181818182
10622,5,076780192X,"Steven Spielberg topped himself with this movie, which arrived two years after JAWS, the movie that blew the movie industry -- and the rest of us -- away.  The first movie to explore aliens from the vantage point of someone  who could be your neighbor, or YOU, is fascinating and utlimately  surprisingly moving.  The visual wonder of this movie is so palpable you  can almost touch it with your hand, and the performances are so in synch  that you become friends with these people by the time the Mother Ship  arrives -- especially Melinda Dillon and Richard Dreyfuss; Teri Garr is as  usual excellent, and Francois Truffaut is the perfect man to embody a  sympathetic scientist, filled with wonder.  When communication between  humans and aliens begins to explode, I found tears welling up in my eyes,  so complete was Spielberg's magic spell.  The fact that this movie  essentially features no real villian is remarkable; it manages to be  profoundly funny, sentimental, interesting and magical without any real  violence and no real character conflict/battle.  John Williams once again  provides a score of majesty and power; the creative collective genius who  concocted an alien encounter entirely through music, whether it was  Williams, Spielberg, the writers, or a combo, deserve(s) special mention,  and Williams' theme evokes precisely the right emotional chords to  transport you to the galaxies above, or at least to heaven.",945993600,12,1437,5.156521739130435
10623,5,076780192X,"One of Spielberg's best films, his next blockbuster as the follow-up to Jaws. Close Encounters, about a man (Dreyfuss) and a few others all have a calling to meet at Devil's Mountain where they will meet  extra-terrestrials. Some of the best scenes full of intesity made whole  with John Williams awesome score. The final scenes are some of the most  memorable, and the best special effects you will see in modern cinema  (comparatively so with CGI). Spielberg also wrote the script, along with a  cameo of famed French director Francois Truffaut.",945475200,,547,4.967032967032967
10624,5,076780192X,"This is one of the most amazing movies you will ever see. It's one spectaculer movie. Just to say, STEVEN SPEILBERG is my hero, my favorite director, and the best director. I am his biggest fan. Just to say, I would  recommend this movie to anyone. They will love it.

10625,5,076780192X,"A classic not only of thoughtful science fiction in the tradition of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", but of cryptic suggestion: Dozens of threads are tied together only slowly, as the viewer gains slowly  more and more access to the facts.

Details like maps and posters B4 internet and smartphones.  Not to mention twisty candles and milk cartons and swim goggle hats.
