5057419,5,B0076ANKSG,Excellent variety of workouts.  Love Stephanie & Shelly as instructors.  Very fun & motivating!  This is a must have for avid exercisers.,1338336000,,137,5.136363636363637
8510817,5,B0076ANKSG,"You definitely need to buy this set of 4 dvd's.  It's really a steal, with each dvd being about 1 hour (but divided into segments, so if you are short on time it's not a problem).  I have a large collection of workout dvds, so that I can pick one for my daily workout depending on my needs that day.  I hadn't done the workouts from Shelly McDonald for a while, and when I worked out to them today, it reminded me how much I love her positive energy and clear instruction.  Nothing confusing, just a fun and solid workout.  I'm also a big fan of Stephanie Vitorino, and wish that both Shelly and Stehanie would come out with new dvds.  They are both superlative teachers.  I'm not sure how old these workouts are, but I assume that they are approximately 10 years old.  Sometimes older workout dvds can be dated (not just the clothes).  But nothing that Shelly Mc Donald or Stephanie Vitorino does is at all dated.  They are wonderful, fun and classic.  I expect to be working out to this collection forever.  So, a super great buy, and you should purchase it.",1466640000,2,1060,4.37948717948718
8510818,5,B0076ANKSG,"Really like this one, challenging, but not too difficult.",1457913600,,57,5.444444444444445
8510819,5,B0076ANKSG,"This video set is a smokin' deal. Two videos from Stephanie Vittorino, two from Shelly McDonald. I mostly use the Vittorino videos- it's challenging and well-rounded, and I like the way she encourages me to keep trying. For those you need two sets of hand weights. For the other two videos you don't need any equipment, so they're good to take traveling.",1426291200,,354,4.725806451612903
8510820,5,B0076ANKSG,"Stephanie Vitorino is great! I really like her style. She is no nonsense and maintains a good pace to her workouts, mixing up strength training and cardio while using handweights, a step and mat work.  There's no fluff or excessive chatting here, the focus is on efficiently working out the entire body. I am working my way through this 4 dvd set and really like it so far.  The set is also a great value when you compare the price of purchasing the dvd's individually. Great intermediate workouts with plenty of variety to cut down on potential boredom.",1423785600,,554,4.642857142857143

8510826,5,B0076ANKSG,"I happened to learn about the release of this DVD collection and I immediately preordered it.  It is a 4 DVD set consisting of 2 workouts each from Shelly McDonald and Stephanie Vitorino.

Bikini Body and Workout on the Go are by Shelly McDonald. She is best known for the Caribbean Workout TV show which I have been a long time fan of.  These 2 workout DVDs were released a few years back and then quickly went out of print.  I was ecstatic to find out they were going to be released as part of this collection.

Unfortunately these do not appear to be the same workouts that were on those original DVDs.  I rented Bikini Body at one time from Netflix and I distinctly remember that those were different episodes than these, I don't know about Workout on the Go but I suspect the same.  This isn't a huge deal but I am slightly disappointed.  While they are not labelled Caribbean Workout these appear to be later episodes of that program.  They are filmed in Barbados and the scenery is amazing.

Bikini Body has 2 - 20 minute workouts, Boot Camp and Muscle Conditioning.  In Boot Camp Shelly is joined by Joanna who is a long time participant on the Caribbean Workout show.  This workout is mainly aerobics, following by some toning using only your body weight before you finish out with some abs.  Much of the aerobics is high impact which I tend to stay away from, but it could probably be modified to low impact fairly easily.

Muscle Conditioning is Shelly exercising by herself.  This workout is more interesting to me, it consists of mainly compound movements or combination exercises as Shelly calls them, light weight work where you work upper and lower body at the same time.  Shelly uses one pair of dumbells and a step though the step is optional, I find the moves easier to do on the floor myself.  An example of some of the exercises you see here are squats/front raise or reach, squat/one arm overhead press, front lunge/lateral raise (I substitute rear lunges), rear lunge off step/bicep curl, chest fly/glute bridge, etc.  You get a lot accomplished in little time here.

Workout on the Go consists on 3 - 20 programs designed for folks on the go and don't have access to a lot of equipment. Shelly is joined by Joanna again for all three workouts.  I really like the scenery on this DVD, they have a pool behind them with lots of colorful flowers all around, in the distance you see the ocean.  The first workout is Athletic Circuit, you will see a lot of aerobics, a mixture of high and low impact with some toning exercises sprinkled in.  Some use a set of hand weights or dumbells, others use just your body weight.

The next 2 workouts are Fitness on the Go 1 and 2.  These workouts are great for people who travel and might be stuck in hotel rooms.  All you need is a chair and yourself, no weights are necessary here, nor to you need a lot of space.  You will see basic calisthenics and some muscle conditioning.

Overall, I am still pleased with these workouts, my schedule is a lot busier these days so I really appreciate having all these short workouts to choose from.  And I have always like Shelly as a lead, I enjoy the banter between her and Joanna, it's like working out with a couple of friends.

I bought this series mainly for the Caribbean Workouts but the main and most pleasant surprise for me was the workouts by Stephanie Vitorino!  I was not really familiar with her before, though I know her from Exercise TV and I have seen her as a backgrounder in several workouts.

The first workout is Body Target 60, Stephanie is joined by Michelle and Carla who shows modifications to some of the moves.  Stephanie gets huge points from me for including a modifier and I follow them any time I see them in a workout.  Many instructors have modifiers these days but not all of them, I really appreciate it when they do though.

Body Target 60 is split up between a few sections, Total Target which switches back and forth between cardio and weight work. The weight work is mostly compound or combination moves using upper and lower body at the same time.  Gradually she will add on pieces to the move to make it harder if you choose, and sometimes you will see balance challenges with really work the midsection, my midsection needs serious help so this will be very beneficial for me!  Some of the moves you will see here are rear lunge/front shoulder raises adding an optional kick, squat w/kettlebell like swing into tricep press, lat row into rear swing adding a rear leg raise, squat/curtsy lunge w/lateral raise.  There are also 3 - 10 minute segments, Arm Target, Buns Target and Core Target, which you can add on or do separately if you choose.  All you need for this workout is a couple sets of dumbells.  Some of the moves are done on the floor on your knees, a chair could be substituted if this isn't comfortable.  Overall I would rate this workout intermediate, advanced if you do the higher impact moves. A bonus feature on this DVD is a segment called ""Body Talk"".  Stephanie is gathered with a group of ladies from her classes and they are discussing the workout, etc.  I liked this segment, it shows that Stephanie really cares about her students.

The other workout is Ultimate Body Shaper.  This workout consists of a high step workout and a mat workout which can be done together or separately if you wish.  Each workout is 30 minutes long, not including warmup or cooldown, those are listed separately on the menu.  Both workouts alternate between cardio (Intensity Boosts) and weight work.  A lot of the weight work is combination moves, with some balance challenges thrown in which works the core.  Stephanie uses this format in many of the workouts I have seen her in(including Exercise TV), but in my opinion she does it extremely well.  Plus they are unique and interesting but effective and safe enough that you aren't going to injure yourself.  I have seen moves in other workouts that are creative, but they border on unsafe, which is too bad.  I didn't see any of that here though.  Proper form is important though which she also demonstrates well.

The high step workout is tough, you need a high step and a couple sets of dumbells.  I put my high step at 10 inches, it appears that 12 inches is used in the workout, I may get to that level some day!  I used anywhere from 5-10 pound dumbells, though I use my 8's quite a bit.  This workout alternates between weight work and cardio intervals which Stephanie calls ""Intensity Boost"". There is no low impact modifier here, but the moves are fairly easy to modify if you choose, although she does start out slow and ups the intensity so you could just stay low if you wanted to. Step ups with bicep curls, rows with tap ups, diagonal lunge with overhead presses, one legged squat with front raise on step (hard!), plank rows are some of the strength moves you see, and some of the cardio moves are high jogs, plank hops, squat kicks, and jumping jacks.  If these don't get your heartrate up, chances are the combination moves will.

The mat workout is done on the floor, on a mat but much of it is standing.  It is the same format as the high step workout, intensity boosts combined with weight work much of it done in compound fashion. Plie squats with chest flies, tree pose with lateral/front raises, reverse lunge with overhead press, static lunge with one arm tricep extension, lunges with rows, single leg deadlift with V press are just some of the weight moves you will see.  Skaters, jacks, mountain climbers, high jogs and rollbacks are some of the cardio moves here.  Warning, the rollbacks are really hard, they are a lot harder than they look but Stephanie and her backgrounders make them look easy.  Rolling like a ball might be a good substitute for this move, that is probably what I will do until I can master this, which will be a long time I think.

I can't forget the cooldown, it is yoga inspired and one of my favorite cooldowns here.  I hate to admit I skip the cooldown in a lot of workouts, not this one.  There is also a segment called V8 abs, where Stephanie shows her favorite ab exercises.

Not only is this an awesome workout, it is visually appealing.  I have seen this setting used by many instructors, but I really like the background lighting she chose, and I really like the outfits she chose for her and her backgrounders, it's almost as if she was really paying attention to details here.  Then there is Stephanie herself, she has a million dollar smile and amazing hair (yes, I am envious of it), plus she and her backgrounders are fitter than fiddles.  I would rate this workout intermediate to advanced.

I have reviewed a lot of workouts, and done even more.  For someone who has only released a couple of workouts on her own (not including Exercise TV), I am very impressed with Ms. Vitorino, her style reminds me a lot of The Firm which I have been a long time fan of.  I believe she was even a backgrounder in some of their more recent workouts actually.  And she is a great instructor, she is pleasant, displays good form and comes across as genuine and caring.

Back to entire package deal here, this is a great price for all the workouts you get.  This is by far my best buy of the year so far.  Highly recommended.",1338681600,19,9274,4.51168364289994
