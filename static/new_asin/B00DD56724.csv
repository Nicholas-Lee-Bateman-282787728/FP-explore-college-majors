5792678,1,B00DD56724,"Night Court deserves a solid 5 stars for the television show but drops dramatically thanks to Warner Home video.

I remember Night Court on NBC and the final episode was a one hour series finale as I recall. Here, it is split into two parts. The first part barely runs 21 minutes.

Also, these final season episodes are almost all 21:57 when the closing credits begin. I know that television shows airing on NBC were not 22:25 total time (after the closing credit roll) on the original network run.

So, has Warner Brothers charged an outrageous price for Video-on-Demand copies that have not been remastered and appear to be the syndicated rerun versions of this great sitcom?

You be the judge.",1373068800,6,696,4.7272727272727275

5792681,5,B00DD56724,"I suppose there are a few people out there who have never heard of the comedy series, Night Court, which ran from 1984 to 1992. But for those unfortunate few, they truly do not know what they are missing.

Night Court broke the usual comic mold. Most comedies are centered around a normal central character witnessing the madness around him or her. With Night Court, everyone is nuts, including Harry Anderson, who plays a judge, a figure society assumes is as solid as a rock.

What made this show so darn funny was clever, well-written scripts, the right combination of identifiable personalities (I mean, who does not know a person like Dan Fielding or Christine Sullivan?), and the choice of actors perfectly suited to match their characters, giving performances of the roles of their careers.

There was also an incredible range in its humor. While most comedy series usually find one level of banality and stay there, the comedy in Night Court covered a greater spectrum. Thus, the humor was sometimes poignant, sometimes philosophical, sometimes slapstick, farcical, or even downright dumb, many times in the same episode. The humor, though, was never boring. The humor was intelligent, smart, ... and just darn funny.

The show never really jumped the shark, even when it easily could. In the eighth season a new character, a ditzy Court Reporter, was introduced. So now there are two comic relief characters in the Courtroom, the Court Reporter and one of the Bailiffs, Bull Shannon (Richard Moll.) While introducing a new character to an established routine is usually fatal to the over-all chemistry of the cast, this new character, through deft comic script-writing, fits right in, adding, not hindering, the comic effect.

Recurring actors include John Astin, of Addams Family fame, Yakov Smirnoff, and Mel Torme, who shows incredible acting flair as Harrys idol.

For all those who have not seen this series, check it out.",1498003200,2,1936,5.034375

5792696,4,B00DD56724,"Season 9 is the last of the Night Court seasons.  It's kind of sad.  Some of the great acting is just petering out.  Dan (Dan Larroquette) will always be remembered for his role as the sleezy Prosecuting Attorney.  He was great at it.  Harry (Harry Anderson) will be remembered as the judge who was actually a person first.

With three two parters in the series, Night Court begins to close down operations.  Harry looks to teaching, Christine to politics.  Dan looks to himself and Bull looks to Outer Space.

And then there's the continued running joke of Harry and Mel Torme.  Harry finally befriends Mel only to unwittingly lead him to slaughter.",1467849600,,650,4.723214285714286

5792738,3,B00DD56724,"Night Court's 9th and final season sees Judge Harry(Harry Anderson) and company rethinking careers and companions, while Bull (Richard Moll) stumbles through the wedding china on his way to matrimonial bliss.

It's a good thing Bull has Harry, Mac (Charles Robinson), Roz (Marsha Warfield) , Christine (Markie Post) and even Dan (John Larroquette) on hand to get him to the altar on time. While Harry considers a career in higher education, Christine takes a look at Congress as Dan rethinks his commitment to his primary field of interest (it's spelled S-E-X).

Meanwhile ditzy-but-stunning court steno Lisette (Joleen Lutz) is harboring a secret of her own, one that concerns a prominent member of the cast. And what on Earth do aliens want with Bull? Mel Torme, Gilbert Gottfried, and Stephen Root are all found among the season's memorable guest-stars. But as the final hour airs - and the cast depart for different climes, whither Judge Harry? A 3-Disc, 22-Episode Collection.

This 1991-92 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 19 years old in my Freshmen year in college and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1992-1993 when George Bush, Sr. was President.",1393200000,,1234,4.894736842105263

The writers expected the Eighth season to be the last, and it was excellent.  This one undoes all the great endings, putting most of the characters back to where they were before the start of season 8.  I found that disappointing, as most of the season 8 changes were for the betterment of all the characters.  Most of the episodes seemed unfocused and tacked on compared to previous seasons.
