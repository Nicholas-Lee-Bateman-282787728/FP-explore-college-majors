7888617,3,6305384665,This film tells the story of two young men involved in the hardcore gang life of China.  Filled with blood filled brawls and hand to hand and knife fights this film is entertaining and deep at the same time.  One of the movies that lifted the careers of Ti Lung and David Chaing.  Worth seeing if your a Shaw Brothers fan.,990576000,,322,4.245901639344262
7888618,3,6305384665,"This 1971 Shaw Bros. kung fu crime drama, better known as DUEL OF THE IRON FIST, offers exciting battles, good acting, and strong period atmosphere. It was directed by Chang Cheh, who directed many Hong Kong kung fu films and made stars out of the leads of this film, Ti Lung and David Chiang. The plot is reminiscent of Japanese Yakuza movies and centers around gang warfare in 1920s China and features an exiled gang lieutenant (played by Ti Lung) coming back to find his old crew in disarray, leading to an escalating series of confrontations. David Chiang is a mysterious suited figure called The Rover who rescues Ti Lung after one particularly harrowing fight and then joins him for the final battle.
The fighting consists of knife slashing and kicks (not a fist in sight!). Ti Lung just rushes into the opposing throng and slashes and kicks until they're all dead or have run away. He's actually quite good here and somewhat believable, at least in the early scenes. Towards the end, it gets to be too much as he takes on impossible odds. The final battle is cut short. Apparently there is an uncut version with the complete battle. The plot is mildly reminiscent of THE GODFATHER (which was made a year later) and the production design (with abundant shades of brown) recalls that film as well. Everything seems to have been shot in the studio, including a railroad scene. Crash Cinema's letter-box transfer is quite good.",983923200,,1430,4.746987951807229
