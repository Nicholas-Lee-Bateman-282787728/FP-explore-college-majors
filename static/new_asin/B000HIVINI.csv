2638490,1,B000HIVINI,"Do not buy this if you are looking for the original version from British TV.  We had recorded that version on a VHS tape and wanted to update to a DVD version.  I failed to read others' warnings that this version has been ""Americanized"" and watered down.  The British (cockney) accent, unconventional language, and irreverence are what made the original a family Christmas favorite.  This version is only appropriate for the kindergarten set.  I am buying a separate replacement from the UK.",1198972800,21,491,4.939024390243903
2638491,1,B000HIVINI,"Beware everyone familiar with this film from British TV. This is an americanized version of what, to me, is a Christmas classic - and it ruins it. Mel Smith no longer provides the funny, colloquial voicing for Father Christmas. Instead you get a sanitized ""posh"" British accent, killing most of the humour. He hardly says ""bloomin'"" at all!",1197331200,42,340,4.879310344827586
2638492,3,B000HIVINI,Nice but a disappointment as the grumpy charm of the original has been editted out and replaced with a sanitized version conforming to preceived American tastes.,1039651200,15,161,5.230769230769231
2638493,4,B000HIVINI,"Narrated by none other than Santa himself, FATHER CHRISTMAS is a cute look at the ""rest"" of Santa's life.  Go along for the ride as Santa vacations in France, Scotland and even Las Vegas before returning to the comforts of home.
Not traditional in any sense of the term, this film brings a more modern feel to the ""life of Santa"".  Use parental discretion when purchasing this video... young children may become confused by this story and might come to you with questions such as why Santa has no Mrs., why he only has four reindeer, and why he lives in a house that appears to be in a city.  This film is, however, perfect for the post-kindergarden crowd who understand that there is more than one way to look at things and will not be bothered by trivial differences in detail.  Also of note is a brief gambling sequence during Santa's visit in Las Vegas.  While the video doesn't make mention of it, it does show Santa involved in the act.  If you actively avoid exposing your child to this activity, (sadly) you should avoid this film as well.
A mere 24 minutes, this video is perfect for families who don't want to miss out on classic Christmas entertainment but don't want their kids parked in front of a tv for hours. (NOTE: if you have a DVD player, I highly recommend purchasing the joint copy of The Snowman (also by Raymond Brigs and a personal favorite of mine) and Father Christmas - you'll get two holiday classics for far less than the cost of purchasing them seperately).
ENJOY!",985046400,,1494,4.514814814814815
2638494,1,B000HIVINI,"WARNING.. This in not the hilarious video we saw on TV in 1995.  This has been scrubbed for ""G"" and does not include the dialoge we had hoped to find.  We tried the other listed video on this site, and it was a  scrubbed""G"" also.",944956800,13,229,4.044444444444444
2638495,5,B000HIVINI,Father Christmas has become a modern British classical Christmas video. I hope it's popularity spreads to the other side of the Atlantic.,941932800,2,137,5.2727272727272725

2638501,3,B000HIVINI,"I was a little disappointing. Its not the version I watched as a child. They have voiced over the original character, and its a little strange for me. I wanted to carry on the tradition of watching this every Christmas eve with my children, as my parents did for me, and was so happy when I found this. I just wish they had kept the original voice and dialogue...",1419292800,,363,4.27536231884058

2638506,2,B000HIVINI,"The expectations set by The Snowman were high as it is an excellent film.
First off this short had dialog which was certainly not expected!
The animation was ok and not nearly the quality of the first.
The hope was extending the Christmas joy of the Snowman to/and through Father Christmas.
Didn't happen.",1358467200,,305,4.773584905660377
2638507,5,B000HIVINI,Great movie.  We loved The Snowman by Raymond Briggs so we bought this movie.  This movie continued the magic.  Would definately recommend.,1357344000,,139,5.2272727272727275
2638508,1,B000HIVINI,"For whatever reason someone decided to re-dub the original Mel Smith voice over with someone who doesn't sound grumpy, doesn't say bloomin' and swaps in words like vacation for holiday. Absolute nonsense. Seek out the original online.",1356393600,,234,5.351351351351352
2638509,1,B000HIVINI,"This version is NOT the original, they have re voiced Father Christmas and made him less grumpy and changed words and his accent. Mel Smith - the first actor listed is NOT the voice actor you get - apparently it is an American voice actor (if you look closely at the description) - I contacted amazon and told them about it - I am returning it for a refund and they are going to look into why mel Smith is listed when so many people have said it is not the right version!! Very disappointed - was showing it in the USA for some UK culture and it was not the version I know - we watched the original version on YouTube instead!",1355184000,3,626,4.097560975609756
2638510,4,B000HIVINI,"This movie is soooooo cute and makes you laugh at times.
I only got this movie because I just ""love"" THE SNOWMAN! Everytime I watch The Snowman I actually cry at the end. It's just so very sad how close the boy is with his Snowman and only to have him melt away never to come back again. But... I think in my mind for a happier ending - that he rebuilds him the next year and he DOES come back to life and every year their friendship just grows and grows and they remain the best of friends forever and ever! :-) So with that said.... onto FATHER CHRISTMAS.....
If you really like or love THE SNOWMAN as I do, I highly recommend this movie. However, don't look for this movie to be like The Snowman. It's a little different but with the same look (drawing and ink coloring technique). It's much funnier than THE SNOWMAN cause Santa needs a vacation and takes several through out the movie. It's a short flick but with much humor. I love when he has to keep running to the b-room!!! :D TOO CUTE and FUNNY! Also don't expect this movie to be a very serene quiet one as THE SNOWMAN because this Santa TALKS and TALKS and TALKS through out the movie but it's a NICE way of talking he does. He doesn't ramble on and on to where it's annoying. With him talking as much as he does I think with what he's saying it ADDS to the movie cause he's hilarious with some of the things he says and the way he says it as well as the way his voice sounds. I like it myself. He's a real cute Santa. The way I've always pictured Santa to be in my mind.
Do get this movie as it will add humor to your holidays. It's a MUST for the avid Christmas movie/DVD collector especially if you like cartoons.
Now I'm waiting to purchase Raymond Grigg's THE BEAR dvd. I've heard that's even better than this movie. But still THE SNOWMAN reigns TOP of all of them! I do agree with that. Wish there could've been THE SNOWMAN PART 2 where the boy and Snowman are reunited again for another adventure. However you do see a short clip of the two together when Santa visits I assume the North Pole in the sky where the Snowmen are having their Christmas party with lots of dancing. There you find the boy and Snowman (from THE SNOWMAN movie) too. Hope to get THE BEAR movie this year sometime in the summer long before next Christmas so that I can watch it when  Christmas comes next year! Raymond Briggs is an excellent author with such heartfelt Christmas stories. If he's still living, I wish he would continue on with his wonderful little stories for Christmas because they aren't just for kids! They are for kids at heart! :-)
HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie - FATHER CHRISTMAS as well as the others ESPECIALLY ""The Snowman""!",1293148800,,2688,4.280943025540275
2638511,1,B000HIVINI,"This version is TERRIBLE!!!  It really deserves ZERO stars.  Only a milktoast (spineless, vascilating sissy) would enjoy it.  ROLL ON MEL SMITH!",1260576000,12,144,5.454545454545454
2638512,2,B000HIVINI,"this is a terrible sanitized version of a great British classic...  lots of funny scenes are missing ...most of the humor is completely lost in this awful re-working..if you want a simple characterless 24 minutes for little children fine...but if you are anticipating the Mel Smith 'fun for all the family' Christmas treat - forget it!  It cites Mel Smith as the 'actor' but he is not!
why oh why can't the original version be released in the US?",1260316800,3,446,4.632911392405063

2638515,1,B000HIVINI,This was not the UK version with Mel Smith although his name appeared in the catalog but the (inferior in my opinion) US version. Still an excellent story but better with the UK voices.,1200528000,8,185,4.470588235294118

8139971,5,B000HIVINI,Delightful traditional Xmas tales narrated by Dave Bowie and featuring his famous Snowman which was re his childhood and where Snowmen go on Xmas Eve- to N Pole to see Santy. The Father Xmas video was a real bonus and funny as well.,1492128000,,232,4.4186046511627906

This American dub is fair and still good fun, though it does take away a good deal of the special's charm by removing the title's character's grumpiness, the focal point of the special and the book it was based on.",1475712000,,249,4.434782608695652
