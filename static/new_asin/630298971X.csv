528475,4,630298971X,"probably one of the only hollywood films to feature the Brazilian martial arts style known as Capoeria. the movie features Mark Dacascos  who hosted the Americanized cooking competition american iron chef. playing against a villain who's accent seems to change every time they have a show down.

the story of an ex military operative coming back to his home town to learn that crime has increase at his local school and ending up becoming the teacher to 12 of the worst students at his old high school. his task is keeping out of trouble by introducing them to Capoeria.

Paco Christian Prieto the actor that plays the main villain tries his best to make the viewer hate him as his character is the reason why the school is the way it is. but his performance comes off as rather comical especially his accent going from Brazilian to Portuguese and back.

the fight scenes are choreographed well  and the music is superb, the acting leaves something to the imagination. the actors try to hard to come across as believable again the villain.

I love the ending but wish they had some sort of epilogue showing what the 12 students and the teacher did after the graduation ceremony.",1469232000,,1178,4.694174757281553

528623,5,630298971X,"IMO, Mark Dacascos is a great martial artist and he demonstrated this in Only the Strong.
This is also the first best movie I've seen about Capoeira. The story, acting and plot is a tad campy (almost predict what is coming next) but music is catchy and upbeat.

Sadly, after making a few good action movies (Crying Freeman, Drive) he starred in a couple really REALLY bad flics and then ran off to Iron Chef America. Despite that, Only the Strong IS a good movie.",1377907200,,463,4.447058823529412

528627,3,630298971X,"Playing out similar to an afterschool special for adolescents, Only The Strong (1993) features a group of troubled teens, whose lives are turned around by their study of martial arts.  There isn't much depth or realism involved, as the main focal point is showcasing Mark Dacascos displaying his skills at Capoeira, a dynamic kick oriented style of fighting, popular in Brazil

After leaving the Green Berets, Louis Stevens (Dacascos) returns to his hometown of Miami.  Visiting his old teacher Mr. Kerrigan (Geoffrey Lewis), he learns that an undesirable criminal element has invaded his former school.  After Stevens uses his fighting skills to chase away some punks, the school decides to sponsor a test program, where Stevens will attempt to reform a group of problem students, using a program that includes the instruction of Capoeira.

Progress is slow, but with the support of his former girlfriend Dianna (Stacey Travis), a teacher at the school, Stevens begins to find some success in reaching the kids, and teaching them fighting skills.  The one exception seems to be Orlando (Richard Coca), a student who is the cousin of an underworld leader named Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto).  Silverio has plans to involve Orlando in his car theft operation, which leads to conflict between Stevens and Silverio, who is also a skilled fighter.

Upset that Orlando appears to be straightening out, Silverio and his gang show up at the school, and set a fire in which one of the students is killed.  This sets the stage for the films climactic final battle between Silvero and his gang, and Stevens and his students.

A fantasy tale of the redemption of youth gone wrong, and good triumphing over evil, Only The Strong nicely showcases the expansive movements and flashy kicks that are a part of Capoeira, as both Prieto and Dacascos have ample opportunities to display their skills.  The violence isn't extreme, and the fighting may present a different look, but that aside, the story doesnt offer much that is new or fresh, as the film has many predictable elements.  Only The Strong may appeal to teens in the Disney demographic, and those who enjoy flash over realism, or attractive male combatants, when it comes to martial arts.",1361059200,,2235,5.010810810810811

528631,5,630298971X,"Remember Dangerous Minds, the movie about the Marine (Michelle Pfieffer) who becomes a teacher and earns their respect by dressing in a leather jacket and teaching them martial arts?  There was an accompanying video by Coolio and a morbidly obese singer named L.V. who, based on the amount of sweat, appears to be singing in a dimly lit sauna.  Remember that?  Well, it's all a rip-off of Only the Strong (which is loosely taken from Band of the Hand).  Anyway...

Dejected after finding his former Miami high school in a drug and gang-fueled mess, a Special Forces soldier named Louis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) attempts to instill discipline into the school's most problematic students via the Brazilian martial art known as capoeira.  Sure, he could have just kicked a bunch of kids out and artificially boosted his school's basic skills test (looking at you, Morgan Freeman), but he decided instead to take on the challenge.

The setup is somewhat clich&eacute;, and the actors playing high schoolers could have been better, but you get what you pay for.  The movie showcases brilliant capoeira moves, a mesmerizing sound-track that features authentic sounds from Brazil, well-crafted fight scenes, and just enough storyline and background to keep it from being completely B-level.  The true star of the film is obviously the fighting, and the fluid moves shown throughout are some of the best fight scenes ever captured on film.

This movie should have garnered more support, and if it were made today Mark Dacascos would be a megastar, and taking roles away from that hack Ryan Reynolds.  Oh well, the world isn't perfect, but this movie nearly is.",1350518400,,1651,5.010989010989011
528632,5,630298971X,"I picked up this film to get an idea about capoeira and how a film about it would be pitched to its fans. I am not a fan of martial arts films at all. But this film worked for me and did what I wanted.

I can see that this is a beautiful form of movement and how music relates to it. I can also see more clearly its potential in bonding and a sort of ""spiritual"" side to it in integrating the physical with the emotional at a higher level than anger etc.

The film allows one to think about male bonding and different ways of bonding that can be more ""civil"" than crude.

That said, the story line was formulaic and sort of an ""off the shelf"" sports film about overcoming great odds with determination etc. There was a sort of inspirational Rocky element that is in almost every sports film. No surprise. Good guy against bad guys. Sit back and take it for what it is and it is very enjoyable. This is not Citizen Kane.

Still it worked quite well for me and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in capoeira even if they are not in the martial arts community. Well done.",1332979200,,1082,4.1380952380952385
528659,4,630298971X,"Ha, ha, ha, I bought this movie because I play capoeira and we are showing it at our Academy for some of the newer students.

I love this movie so much it's absurd. The overacting, the improbable story, the ridiculous wardrobes, it's everything that made the late 80s/early 90s great. And then, to top it all off, the martial arts are incredible. In fact the movie merely acts as a vessel for capoeira in the same way a plate is the vessel for a dinner. This move highlights capoeira in a way that is not plausible at all to the layman, but any traditional martial artist will recognize, as a way to improve lives.

The movie is lovable in the same way Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension is lovable, in a completely ridiculous way. Don't expect a great movie, just an enjoyable one.",1287360000,,869,4.6

528667,5,630298971X,"The fundamentals of martial arts are lost on many people, nowadays. In a world dominated by mixed martial arts fandom, the common notion is that these age-old systems of combat - when not being derided as decrepit or inefficient - are only good for fighting off street thugs and/or beating up people inside a cage. The aspects of character-building and spiritual betterment are no longer as widely appreciated by the general populous, who are routinely conditioned to believe that you have to be a 200+ pound muscleman to excel in self-defense. Thus, the unorthodox Brazilian style capoeira, regularly jeered as being too showy for practical use, isn't a common sight in Hollywood...save for this movie. While the film's tagline (""the Ultimate Martial Art"") is ambiguous, few movies like this do as good of a job of exploring the social benefits of the fighting arts. The spirit of capoeira as a means of preserving culture and community is perfectly expressed in Mark Dacascos' first starring vehicle, which I consider to be an underrated classic many times over.

The story: Green Beret Louis Stevens (Dacascos,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood-of-the-Wolf/dp/B00006ADEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a>) returns from his military service in South America to his Miami hometown to find his old high school transformed into a dangerous haven for gangs and drug dealers. At the urging of his former teacher (Geoffrey Lewis, ""Maverick""), he takes a dozen of the worst-case students under his wing in a special program to teach them virtue via the capoeira he learned in the military. He works against the pessimism of doubting school officials, the apathy of the students, and the will of the lethal neighborhood crime lord (Paco Prieto).

I will never understand why this film didn't catapult Mark Dacascos into instant Hollywood prominence alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme and Seagal - he's certainly got the moves and superior acting ability. I suppose that given his storied career, it doesn't really matter, but fact is that his physical performance in here is amazing. In lighting up a number of fluid fights and demonstrations, he's backed up by baddie Paco Prieto - an exceptional capoeirista himself, who fought Van Damme in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lionheart/dp/0783228465/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lionheart</a>&nbsp;- and legitimate teacher Mestre Amen Santo, not to mention the students who learned the style for the movie. Rock-solid choreography makes for seven exquisite exhibitions filled with plenty of kicks, flips, tricks, spins, and even a couple of nifty weapons encounters including metal poles and machetes. Were it not for his work on the cult flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>, I'd daresay that this is the highlight of Frank Dux's fight-staging career; there's some truly amazing stuff to be seen here.

However, the fight content largely serves to support the movie's message of defying poor standards and peer pressure, even if it comes from your own family. Martial arts flicks carry the stigma of being morally empty and featuring substandard acting, but these criticisms do not apply here. Though established stars Dacascos and Lewis, along with Stacey Travis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-World/dp/B00005T30L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost World</a>) and Todd Susman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Roller-The-Stu-Ungar-Story/dp/B00070Q7VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Roller - The Stu Ungar Story</a>) as members of the teaching staff are reliable, I was most surprised by the performances of the young actors playing the students. Little-known performers like Roman ""Shay"" Cardwell, Ryan Bollman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-NeverEnding-Story-III-Escape-From-Fantasia/dp/B00006472Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The NeverEnding Story III - Escape From Fantasia</a>), and particularly Richard Coca (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Knight/dp/B0018B15P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Knight</a>) do themselves justice as youths troubled by indifference and peer pressure, giving Dacascos' character real issues to work with and exhibiting tangible character growth. It's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Karate-Kid/dp/0800179501/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Karate Kid</a>&nbsp;on a larger scale and a few years older: it's melodramatic and a bit sensationalistic, sure, but the problems and situations explored are relevant to the real world (even 17 years after the film was made) and handled well.

Rest assured, in the end, ""Only the Strong"" is only a martial arts movie, but for once, the term ""martial arts movie"" is respectfully not confused with ""action movie with a lot of kicking"". While high on the list of the best films of Mark Dacascos, it's more notable for being one of the few movies of its kind that has actual heart behind its nifty moves.",1267833600,,5265,6.495726495726496

528671,4,630298971X,"Ok so there are a few ways to judge this movie. Is it a masterpiece. No. Not even close. However, if you grew up watching king fu theater and understand the mindset you must be in to watch this type of movie, it is great fun! The acting was horrible as was the writing itself. On several occasions the Villain kept switching from a spanish accent to a brazilian one or worse yet, pronouncing a word incorrectly in either language. The editing in this movie was below amateur as well. Too many mistakes to begin noting. The casting was probably the worse thing in the flick. To believe that any of the boys in the class were one of the 12 baddest kids in the school forces you to suspend all belief in reality and just get on bored for the ride. LOL!!!

Ok that said, this was the first U.S. movie made that used capoeira as the primarly artform, making it a pioneer. The movie was also a lot of fun. It was so bad that it was terrific to watch! This rare quality is similar to old kung fu flicks and most Jackie Chan movies. You aren't watching them for technical or acting or script quality.

This movie is what introduced me to capoeira. In fact it took me 3 years after seeing this to finally find a school to learn it. Over one hour away from home. Since then I have helped open a capoeira school in Philadelphia for a Brazilian Master and have helped bring this beautiful art to many people. All that started with this movie. So for that, the beautiful adventure that I found as a result of seeing this film, it is a masterpiece.

I have to say that I was highly disappointed that there were no special features on this DVD. That was just wrong!!!!

If you are a martial arts movie fan and in a non-serious mood, Check this movie out. Maybe it'll inspire you to living an adventure of your own!

528673,4,630298971X,"Why Mark Dacascos isn't a bigger name in movies confounds me a bit. To me, he's always had the qualities to be a star in action cinema. Guy looks good, is very fit, has an appealing screen presence, and can even act some. And he's definitely got the martial arts cred. I first saw him in ONLY THE STRONG back in 1993, and dude left an impression.

This film takes us back to the days when it was still hip to hoist a ghetto blaster on your shoulder. Louis Stevens (Dacascos), a former Green Beret and fresh off a military stint in Brazil, has just returned home to the seamier side of Miami. When visiting his former school teacher, Louis can't help but note the downhill progression of his old high school. Steel bars and security staff run rampant in school, but do little to stem the thuggery and drug deals going down. When Louis applies his capoeira techniques to fend off several goons on the school grounds, his teacher takes in the students' reactions and hits on the idea of hiring Louis to instruct the art of capoeira to twelve of the worst kids in school.

Predictably, Louis's experimental martial arts program doesn't win the kids over in a day, but, little by little, progress is made and the kids begin to pay attention. But one of his pupils turns out to be a relative of the local drug and chop shop kingpin, Silverio, who himself happens to be a capoeira master. As Louis begins to impact these messed-up kids, Silverio begins to feel threatened. Soon, he and Louis are engaged in a brutal contest to determine who runs these Miami streets.

While ONLY THE STRONG isn't my favorite Dacascos flick (that would be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crying-Freeman/dp/B0013M0Z8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crying Freeman</a>&nbsp;and the awesomely awesome&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive-Special-Collectors-Edition/dp/B0013M2VYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive (Special Collectors Edition)</a>), it's still a very solid action film. The fight choreography is very good, with the film showcasing the Brazilian art of capoeira. Dacascos is a dynamic martial artist, slicing the air as he does with acrobatic strikes and kicks. Dacascos was already well-versed in judo and karate, but had to learn the discipline of capoeira for this movie. I'm no expert so it's not for me to say how convincing he is in demonstrating his capoeira skills, but I came away feeling good about this very rhythmic martial arts. I dig that capoeira exudes such a sense of fun and excitement in its free-wheeling, seemingly improvisational style. Even right now, I feel like busting a ginga (cue the song ""Paranaue..."").

There's a whiff of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-and-Deliver/dp/6305161917/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand and Deliver</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lean-on-Me/dp/6305133514/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lean on Me</a>&nbsp;in this film, but don't get it twisted, ONLY THE STRONG is, above all, a martial arts movie, so there's a fair amount of violence here. But, hopefully, viewers will come away with an awareness of just how much training, focus, and self-sacrifice it takes to master the martial arts, and also with an appreciation of the inherent beauty and serenity of the thing. The film's plot tends to run its generic course, with the school teacher premise serving more as a backdrop to the capoeira sequences. And, in these sequences, Mark Dacascos shines.

Really, why isn't this guy bigger in movies?",1219536000,,3624,5.666666666666667

Public fights never end like it is shown in movies - vengence and maiming and death are much more a realistic end to physical violence.
Further, although the martial art style is exotic and interesting - this is not a fighting system!  Sure it may have some distant roots in a camouflaged martial routine - but was and is not a true or even practical fighting system (like Krav Maga or MMA).  It takes very little understanding of physics to see that standing upside down on one hand while kicking, is not the most effecient use of balance, weight or speed - all of which are required for effective fighting.

However he did seem to have the needed requirements:  minimal acting chops, a ripped body, and the ability to do some amazing fight scenes.  The last reason is what makes this movie a little known action classic.  The movie is completely average, except the amazing kicks & other athletic moves preformed mostly by Dacascos.  The best part of the fight scenes however is the fact that they don't look completely fake.  With movies today they use so many wires & special effects that they leave whatever sense of reality the movie had previously maintained behind.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes old school action flicks.  If you like this movie you will probably like ""Drive"" another little known classic featuring Dacascos.

I remember catching this on HBO(of course) while staying home sick from school one day(knowing me, I probably wasn't actually sick, but that's beside the point).  Glancing at the box cover, it's easy to mentally shelve this away alongside movies like American Ninja 4 or anything with Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson.  Make no mistake about it though, while this may be a bit formulaic, it's does stand out.  The plot is an often told tale of outsider who teaches misfit kids self respect and fair play.  In this case, it's Mark Dacascos teaching Capoeira.  Capoeira is a martial art from Brazil that seems to consist of a lot of spinning kicks. It almost looks like a dance of sorts(I think it is actually).  I'm not an expert on martial arts by any means, but this style is fascinating to watch and the movie takes every opportunity to showcase it.  That's a good thing too, coz this particular style isn't really shown in movies.  Well, Dacascos teaches this style to the kids as part of a new unofficial high school program, and it becomes a hit not only with the students, but with the school and community.  Now comes the Van Damme-ish part of the film.  One of the most difficult(and in the end, most dedicated) students is cousin to a Brazilian drug lord who reigns over the neighborhood.  He's not too happy about Dacascos' interference with his plans, or his turning his cousin against him.  In a coincidence that only action films can muster, this drug lord is also a master of Capoeira.  Soon the war is on between the drug lord and Dacascos, resulting in a big Capoeira showdown.  No, it's not all terribly original, but something about this movie really works.  What would normally comes across as corny, doesn't so much.  Maybe it's the mesmerizing Capoeira scenes, maybe the performances.  Well, maybe not the performances coz they're typical of this kind of film.  Normally the name Mark Dacascos slapped across the front of a dvd cover box is reason to walk away considering he's never been the mark of quality for a film(though he always seems to have a good screen presence, bad movie or not).  This movie could have made him a star though.  It's not Shakespeare or anything, but he manages to take a tough guy martial arts character a la Van Damme/Seagal, and make him more human and likable.  Yes, Dacascos does a fine job here, and he has some terrific moves.  I very much recommend this one to anyone who likes to discover those good ones that slip through the cracks.

528701,4,630298971X,"Amongst the thousands of martial arts films in circulation, it is near impossible to find one that focuses on Capoeira fighting.  And among a few films that contain tournaments, such as the Bloodsport series, you can find a Capoeira fighter in the tournament.  But if you are looking for a fighting style used throughout an entire film, Only The Strong is the only movie I know of.

In addition to a Capoeira treat, the movie stars Marc Dacascos, a fan favorite by many who has been in several notable films such as Drive, Cradle 2 The Grave, and American Samurai.  Though not a true Capoeira fighter, Dacascos did a pretty good job of learning it for this film.  Though the fights look unrealistic because of all the flash of the moves, nevertheless it is beautiful choreography that is quite original and never gets old.  This is why we watch movies after all, to see fantasy fights that look sweet.

As for the story, though somewhat cheesy, I thought it too was quite original.  The Mark Dacascos character returns to his old high school in Miami, Florida and begins a program to teach the absolute worst kids there the art of Capoeira.  Unfortunately, one of the student's cousins, Silverio (played by Paco Christian Prieto - Street Law, Champions), tries to put an end to it, leading up to a big confrontation and fight between Dacascos and Prieto.  I loved the fight scene.  It lasted 4 minutes, about average length, and took place on a sgement of Miami beach at night.  The choreography for this fight was amazing to watch.

You might even like the soundtrack for this film, which incorporates a lot of rhythm and beat for the fighting.  Songs like ""Bananawe"" may stick in your head for hours and hours after watching.

I highly recommend Only The Strong if you want to see a lot of Capoeira fighting, or just something different in a martial arts movie.  I also recommend Tony Jaa's newest movie ""The Protector"" if you want to see a really flashly fight involving Capoeira.",1180396800,,1983,4.671469740634006

As a capoeirista myself I found the actual demonstration of the art to be very limited and the writers understanding of the art to be somewhat lacking.  Mark Dacascos is not a Capoeirista but trained in a style of kung fu, explaining why his skill in Capoeira is less than desireable but his basic fighting knowledge pretty good.  He trained for six months in capoeira  for this movie which is not enought to really get any good.  In response to one of the other posts, Capoeira is Brazilian.  It is based on an African fighting style but does not currently , nor has it since the slaves modified it so much, resembled the lost African art it originated from.  OTS is a campy movie that has a lot of flaws to it.

All that being said I have to say that I really liked.  Admittedly it has so many things wrong with it that I could not list them all here but I didn't care when watching it.  It is fun, and easy to get into.  As a capoeirista I felt that they showed a good effort in displaying all the art in many parts, even if the writers really didn't understand on a higher level what it is about.  The movie was memorable and entertaining.  I recomend watching it but I just can't give it more than three stars because of huge cheese factor.

What I was greeted with was a painfully gruesome movie. I was saddened by the fact that, when viewed only once, this movie flat out sucked. While I did expect the acting and plot line to take a backseat to the fight scenes, they were just too painful to ignore. The villain (who, by some random freak chance, also knows Capoeira... go figure) is such an over the top, macho, ""heterosexual"", overdramatic character, my friend and I could not stop laughing.

This whole movie is laced with scenes where when they're not meant to be funny, they're hilarious. When they're supposed to be funny or light-hearted, they're annoying.

The only reason this movie gets a 2 is because the Capoeira is quite impressive in some scenes. I just wish the scenes of Capoeira hadn't been wasted on the main character teaching a bunch of smart-ass teenagers how to do the moves. The final fight scene between the hero and the villain even abandons the fighting style Capoeira altogether that is seen throughout the entire film and, instead, we see the two characters, tired and weary, flat out punching and kicking each other.

I wanted this movie to be a great movie because of the fighting style that it revolved around. It just so happened that the Capoeira fight scenes were not impressive enough to get over the glaring issues of the acting, dull plot line, and painful characters.

He played the berimbau (an insrument used in Capoeira) wrong, he pronouced many of the terms incorrectly, and he had no flow to his movements.  2. The acting was horrible.  While watching this, you kind of get the picture that the director wanted to finish this movie a soon as possible.  Most of the lines were just stupid.  Dacascos character had no real history.  apparently had this mysterious past you really could care less about because the plot was so predictable. 3. The fighting was laughable at best.  Capoeira is the only martial art that was outlawed for being so violent and unstoppable.  You don't need corny fight scenes to show it's usefulness.  Most of the fight scenes where repeated movements that were shot at different angles.  Dacascos was doing meia lua's (a spinning kick in which both hands are on the ground as you strike) that were knocking out three people at once.  In one ridiculous scene, Saverio (the drug lord) pointed to where he wanted Dacascos to stand so that he could miraculously appear behind him and perform and unchallenged jumping kick to the back of his head.  I wish an experinced Capoeirista would have done the fight scenes.  Although this movie was horrible, it is the only movie in which Capoeira is suppose to be the main artform used. While watching this movie, one can only hope that this poor performance dosen't hurt Capoeira's chances at being the cornerstone of another movie.",1104710400,5,1599,4.729241877256317

(USA - 1993)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo SR

Upon returning home to Miami, a former Green Beret (Mark Dacascos) is employed by his local high school to rehabilitate some of its worst students by teaching them the art of capoeira (a form of martial arts from Brazil, using dance-like moves). But his work brings him into conflict with a local drug lord (Paco Christian Prieto), whose operations are threatened by Dacascos' interference...

A predictable B-movie plot is elevated above the routine by virtue of its slick presentation and interesting cast, all of whom turn in creditable performances under the assured direction of Sheldon Lettich (former scriptwriter of RAMBO III who went on to helm some of Jean-Claude Van Damme's most popular entries, including LIONHEART and DOUBLE IMPACT). The script - co-written by Lettich and Luis Esteban - provides a showcase for the visual artistry of capoeira, practised with genuine flair by DTV favorite Dacascos (BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF), whose mastery of the form helps to win over some of the most problematic students at his former high school, now a crime-ridden wasteland whose faculty (led by Geoffrey Lewis, acting everyone else off the screen) is clearly at the end of its collective tether.

A faint air of camp hangs over the entire enterprise, as ultra-buff Dacascos flaunts his pumped-up torso through a variety of tight-fitting vests (drool! slobber!) while facing off against ultra-butch Prieto (a real life martial arts instructor, making one of his first screen appearances), though ultra-cute Stacey Travis hovers around just long enough to blunt the film's relentless macho swagger and provide a fleeting romantic interest for Dacascos, thereby reassuring the movie's target audience that his character is entirely heterosexual. The film is naive, obvious and predictable, but it moves at a rapid clip and is well-staged thoughout, and the bone-crunching fight scenes manage to live up to every expectation. Good, catchy music score, too.",1081728000,5,2049,5.311728395061729

528736,5,630298971X,"Most people who purchase this movie will do so because of the martial arts action and it will be well worth it. Mark Dacascos is highly underrated, perhaps due to some of his choices to star in movies that really don't highlight his abilities both as a martial artist and an actor.
On the martial arts side, there's some great displays of Mark's abilities. His kicks are extremely fast and he demonstrates acrobatic abilities that most martial artists wish they had. The only thing you don't get a sense of is the speed of his hands, which is up there with Bruce Lee. You can get some idea of this in Drive and Redline.
The thing that elevates Mark above his other action alumni is his acting ability. While he's not going to be mistaken for a Gary Oldman or Tim Curry in true acting ability, he does hold his own against most of the popular actors out there. This movie is pretty watchable even without the martial arts. Although it's not very artistic, it's still watchable and it does have a message.
On to the extras. Or, I should say, the complete lack of extras. I have the VHS version which has a video on it but we don't even get that for the DVD. I've also seen some photos of the movie showing Mark doing some high flying kicks against the main villian, which would have been nice to have in a deleted scenes or making of feature. Sadly, these are missing, but still a great movie.",1077494400,,1391,4.374517374517374
528737,5,630298971X,"Mark Dacascos delivers a performance that could only be described as breathtaking in a movie that delivers the perfect balance of punch and pomp.  On the exterior, Only the Strong is the story of a GI who comes home and tries to ressurect the neighborhood through Capoeira, a Brazilian martial art.  At the heart of this film lies the story of a man who is lost and searching for redemption.  He finds his niche in helping troubled teendage students at a gang-ridden Miami public high school.  While the students come around and change their behavior along with their outlook on life, Dacascos meets them halfway and finds his true self and love, too boot.  Only the Strong is a scintillating and uplifting drama that teaches us that controlled violence is the best way to solve problems.

Being in martial arts myself I know Capoeira realistically speaking is useless for self-defense but Only the Strong does an excellent job of making it look realistic.
I remember seeing this movie when it first came out at theatres when I was in my teens.
This movie  is what first brought Capoeira(an afro-brazillian martial arts combining martials,dance,gymnastics and acrobatics)an art with its owh history,its popularity to the rest of the world after so many years of Capoeira's existance.

I remember seeing a featurette on TV, why didn't they include that? 20th Fox just slaps the movies on the DVD with no effort and thinks that's ok! Well they are lazy and could have done better. The Reality is we are in the ""21st"" century and DVD has many capabilities to take advantage of. A documentary about capoeira and interviews could have been nice. I hope to see more Capoeira movies with a good storyline. This is a must for your martial arts collection seeing that there aren't many capoeira movies out there.",1072828800,3,564,4.53921568627451

This showed good examples of capoeria moves and styles.  The hero was using Regional, while the villiean was using Angola.

The first five minutes and the last five minutes are the only ones that contain any real capoeira, and that is mostly just flashy.

It has a cool plot (bad guy rules city, good guy comes and kicks bad guys [rear]) and the capoeira is extremely fascinating and authentic.  At some points the men were moving so fast and executing attacks so quickly that I had to stop, rewind, and watch it frame by frame.

I love the film because there are some very good looking guys in there (especially the guy that plays Arlando and of course Mark Dacascos)! After seeing this movie you'll want to keep seeing it over and over and maybe even want to take up martial arts! My 8 year old niece and my mom who is 53 aloso enjoyed this film as much as I did!

In the beginning of the video you see Mestre Amen pulling a backflip at one point of the roda and landing somewhere else in the roda...very weird. But its cool enough for people who don't know what Capoeira is too see a little.
When I showed my teacher...the only thing he said was that the only good guy in this video is Mestre Amen.
Look at the beginning of the video...how many times do you see someone do a ginga??? almost never.

528780,4,630298971X,"This is a charming movie with a stupid storyline like those seen in most martial arts movies. But hey, the point is to see the hero beat the bad guys with some sweet moves, right? And this movie delivers just that. So  why bother analysing it any deeper?
Mark Dacascos plays a young  capoeirista (a guy who practises capoeira) who gets some misfit students  onto the right side of the law by teaching them capoeira. Of course this  leads to some showdowns between him and various criminal elements. And  that's it, really. But capoeira is a beautiful sport to watch, and the  movie is a good teaser for the real thing.
But Dacascos isn't really a  capoeirista, and the movie misinterprets some of the basic elements of the  sport. If you become interested in learning more after watching the movie,  look up the nearest capoeira club in the phonebook and try it for yourself.  I guarantee it will be an experience well worth your while! I speak from  personal experience.",958953600,12,971,4.652941176470589

528782,5,630298971X,this movie started out just like any other movie but i had the twist of a far off nation and its surroundings.  the whole point of this movie is well documented right after Lewis Comes home to Miami to see his whole high  school up in flames with drugs and violence when he throws a drug dealer  off campus it put the whole movie in perspective in his views and his old  social studies teacher by getting the attention of the students with the  off beat form of brazillian martial arts. As the story drew on the point  became more clear to the audience and the actors that if given direction  anyone can do anything they set their minds to if it is to graduate high  school or follow a career in something the movie is motivational as well as  entertaining. Also i think that parents should let their childern watch  thios movie to tell them what to stay away from. One a scale of 1 to 10  (violence rating) i would give it a 4.5 it is not that voilent to let a  young person watch but this movie is one to watch,954979200,,1012,4.15979381443299
528783,2,630298971X,"I feel that this movie was an okay movie because it is about my favorite thing in the world: Capoeira. I feel that the main character would be better if he was a real capoeira mestre, not some Karate Champion. The only  parts worth watching are the first and last 5 minutes where you get to see  roda in action. I am a self-taught capoeira student and I can play better  than the goofs that they put in the movie. It is a good movie for capoeira  newbies, but if you really want to know about REAL capoeira, research and  find a mestre near you so that you can experience the exhileration of  practicing such a beautiful art.",948844800,,625,4.254237288135593

He studied for only four weeks, and he  looks like a master!  An acrobatic sensational ride of whirling kicks and  flips to a heavy back beat.

Those Brazilian martial arts and their ability to flip their bodies beautifully andartfully in the air is unsurpassed in other *typical* martial arts films, (Chan movies, etc.).  The only thing I thought was odd about the story, was Orlando Olivera's cousin Silverio.  He was the main drug lord and gang boss, who crossed swords with Stevens (Dacascos). What are the odds that Silverio would know the same martial art as Stevens?  In addition, why didn't Orlando, Silverio's cousin and troubled student, tell Stevens that his cousin knew Capeiora also?!  I mean, wouldnt' Orlando rather learn from his cousin first?
