194210,5,1573626171,"Well I still get upset when I think of the terrible circumstances surrounding the death of Phil Hartman. His talents were so great and we were robbed of him in his prime. A lot of us know Phil from his hillarious work on the Simpsons where he provides the voices of many characters including Lynall Hutz and Troy McClure... Some of us however were priveledged enough to see him in his element... Saturday Night Live. Phil had the ability to do hundreds of voices and play more characters than you can count... Some of his more memorable ones are displayed on this video including Discover the World of Science, Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer and my personal favourite The very funny King and I skit... Guarenteed to make you laugh.
I miss Phil he made the whole world laugh and this video is a tribute to how great the man really was.",1003708800,,827,4.52

I would say 30 out of the 36 sketches on this tape are very funny.  It's incredibly saddening that Hartman is no longer alive to share more laughs with us.  This tape is a great tribute to the times that he was.  I dare you fans and new viewers to try not to laugh as you view this truly great tribute to a truly comedic genius.",1003536000,25,1350,5.004464285714286
194212,3,1573626171,"Before you slam me, keep in mind I am definitely not giving Phil Hartman's talent a less-than perfect rating (I would give him 10 out of 10 stars, if I were rating that) or his performances on SNL as a whole a sub-par rating  (10 out of 10 stars again, if that were the case).
I just felt that this  collection didn't do him the justice he deserved. There was some great  stuff in here, such as him as Barbara Bush, The Sinatra Group (where as  Sinatra, he hilariously puts down his 'guests' Billy Idol, Sinead  ""Uncle Fester"" O Connor, and Luther Campbell, played by Sting,  Jan Hooks, and Chris Rock) Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, Bill Clinton, and more.  After watching it, however, I did feel like they could have done a better  job putting it together-there were sketches that I really had to wonder  what they were thinking (such as the beheading one) when they included them  instead of more of PH as Ed McMahon, or  even more Sinatra. After it was  over, my husband said he felt like he was watching ""The Best of Jan  Hooks and Phil Hartman"", since she seems to play a more prominent role  in some of the bits they include than he does. I should state in all  fairness that I was never a big fan of hers, and was relieved when left the  cast. But even if she didn't irritate me, this should really be a tribute  that focused more closely on Hartman.  I agree that they (Hooks and  Hartman) worked closely together (for example, she played Hilary to his  Bill)so it would have been hard not to have her appear at least part of the  time. I just wanted less of her and more of Hartman.
At first, I didn't  especially like the short film they ended it with (Hooks plays an elderly  star who goes to her safety deposit box to try on her prized jewelry  collection, and we flash back to her as a young woman, dancing with Hartman  in a glamorous Astaire/Rodgers type musical)  the first time I watched it,  but upon repeated viewings, the ending really grew on me and I found it  very touching and fitting. It is so well-done and romantic that it probably  would make me choked up a tiny bit even if Hartman was still alive,  but  since his tragic murder, it really is poignant to the point where  I get  teary just thinking about it.  At the risk of sounding really sappy, his  death was so shocking and unexpected that I still hard to believe sometimes  that he is gone. This video collection is good, but just seems as though it  was slapped together too fast (with the better organized Farley tribute, I  get the feeling they already had put the whole thing together and ready to  go months before he passed away-they aired it what, 2 weeks after he died).  I am sure everyone involved in the making of this collection was still  emotional and shaken up after Hartman's death, and were maybe so sad (he  was especially well-loved among everyone that worked on the show-I have  never heard anyone ever say anything negative about him before or after he  died) that they didn't have their hearts in it to do the best job possible.  I enjoyed it, but felt it was too short and left out too much...though it's  a long shot, I'm hoping for a volume 2, a second, better-organized  collection.",963878400,74,3188,4.407917383820998

However, most of the rest of the material is horribly chopped up - it is much too short (sometimes just a few seconds), taken out of context, and thus very frustrating. It also includes some really crappy skits that don't do justice to the hundreds of great skits they did NOT include...

194465,3,1573626171,"My review here is a response I posted to the guy who gave this DVD only 1 Star:

""While I don't agree with you about your assertion that this DVD is a COMPLETE piece of tripe, I DO agree that they could have done a better selection of Phil's funnier stuff. For the life of me, I can't figure out why Phil's Susan The She-Male from Mike Meyers' Sprockets sketch isn't included (""Allo, my name is Susan, und I just got out of prison!""); I thought I was going to fall on the floor when ""she"" shared what a perfect date with Jason Priestlywould be. (Also, this for me was the funniest Sprockets skit ever--a parody of The Dating Game.) I also would have liked to have seen where he does his dead-on Frank Sinatra imitation and he's confronting Jan Hooks as Sinead O'Connor. It is a crime, also, that they left off 3 of his most unforgettable characters from Dana Carvey's Church Lady sketches: Donald Trump, Jimmy Swaggart, and the HYSTERICALLY funny bit with him as Jim Bakker and Jan Hooks as the hideously mascara-streaked tearful Tammy Faye Bakker. These 3 sketches had me LMAO.

""Lastly, why the producers thought Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer belonged on here is a mystery to me. This was one of the VERY few examples of how not everything Phil did on SNL was solid gold--probably the most unfunny character in his entire repertoire. But considering the unbelievable talent this man had, it can easily be overlooked. The fact that he was taken from us in such a cruel & unnecessary way still hurts even today, and you can see from the final sketch on the DVD--a very touching musical number with Jan--that it absolutely devastated his fellow cast members...not to mention those of us who loved & respected him. Rest in peace, Phil.""",1282521600,,1728,4.588996763754046
194466,3,1573626171,"For the most part, this Phil Hartman collection is okay. However, a few skits they should have added are ""As World Turn"" (another Frankenstein skit, with Mel Gibson as his evil twin brother), ""Founding Fathers"" (especially the part where Hartman, as Ben Franklin, pretends to be Marilyn Monroe and sings ""Happy Birthday Mr. President""), and the one where he plays the baby doctor who deliveries are all girls...sort of. Plus, they could've done without the ""Robot Repair"" and ""Sassy"" skits. They were just stupid.",1265155200,,513,5.119047619047619
194467,5,1573626171,"Like other utility comedy performers such as Dan Aykroyd & Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman could do practically anything on SNL with ease, and be consistently brilliant at it. Sure, he lent his distinctive voice to ""The Simpsons"" cartoon show & worked on ""Newsradio"" (post-SNL). But there's no doubt he did his best work on SNL.
The ""Bill Clinton jogging to McDonald's"" sketch eerily foreshadows the Lewinksy scandal yet to come (""Listen fellas, there's a LOT of things Mrs. Clinton doesn't know!""). His rare breakup on camera during a ""Tonto, Tarzan & Frankenstein"" sketch is memorable (he escaped by crashing through a wall). The Anal-Retentive Chef is one of my favorite Hartman bits. His sendup of a moronic Peter Graves hosting (and ruining) a science TV show is hilarious. And his early satire of a one-dimensional movie actor (circa 1947) talked into trying the new ""sci-fi monster"" genre (with fellow cast member Jon Lovitz) is classic stuff.
Watching this collection, I can't help but respect & admire Hartman's wide range & professionalism as a comedy performer.

Hartman was a comic genius, period. He was the best supporting actor ever on SNL, hands down, able to take a walk-on in a crappy skit and turn it around with one line. He was also a fabulous impressionist; his Sinatra, Clinton, etc etc are classics.

I agree with the other reviewers here that this is NOT the best stuff he did for the show, but there are a few of his best here, and those alone make this a must.

Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer may be my all-time favorite SNL short; a perfect script and Phil milks it to the hilt.
Lots of other nuggets here; just watching Hartman's face is enough to crack me up even when he's not speaking. He was a true master of comedy.

You may also remember him as Troy McClure, star of such shows as News Radio, but some of his best moments are here.
BUT, many more of his best skits lay in the vaults; there were dozens of great ones and dozens of good ones.
Lorne Michaels should be kicked in the ass for not having a Volume Two out by now.

We miss you, Phil. You made life a lot more fun.",1190505600,,1038,4.093596059113301

There were so many great skits left out here that I just cannot give it five stars. And that is not to say it's a function of time as some of what they left in was rather mediocre.

As for Hartman, there were few more gifted comedians in history. His impressions were masterful and an absolute joy. He had that winning combination of talent and intensity that is possessed by few others. The end of his life was a tragedy as he is one of those rare deceased celebrities who our culture actively misses. He continues to be an inspiration for the general public along with young comedians everywhere.",1186012800,,806,4.52054794520548

""Man Who Reminds Me Of My Doggie"" ... ""Hair Head!""  I thought for SURE that THE funniest skit in all of SNL history would be on there, but no...it was just a 20 second clip. I was SO disappointed!!

And it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety...They just weren't funny.

On a positive note, there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the DVD that was so sweet, it brought me to tears. And the bonus featuring Phil's audition was quite interesting. But overall, I don't recommend it.",1168300800,5,894,4.216374269005848

Yes, some reviewers are correct, this DVD could be better. Maybe there are missing, funnier, sketches; maybe the finale is too romantic; maybe ...  (that's why it gets a 4 star rating from me).

But still, this will make you laugh and remember good old Phil.

Among others, you will find him impersonating Bill Clinton, Frank Sinatra, Phil Donahue, Alm. Stockdale, Donald Trump, Jesus, Barbara Bush, Frankenstein, Ronald Reagan and Ed McMahon. He also appears as the Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, a russian weightlifter, the Anal Retentive Chef, and other funny characters.

Again, if you were a Hartman fan and miss him, get this. It might not be perfect but it's good enough. Hopefully they will make a second DVD with more sketches.",1159315200,2,816,4.884057971014493

194532,3,1573626171,"Phil Hartman was a cast member on ""Saturday Night Live"" for eight years. During that time, he gave the show some its most memorable and hilarious moments. From zany recurring characters to dead - on impressions of people in the news, he always knew how the grab the audience. So after his untimely death in 1998, it was only fitting that the good peole at ""SNL"" would put together a collection of Phil's best moments on the show. The result, ""The Best Of Phil Hartman"", was a good collection but many people felt something was wrong.

""The Best Of Phil Hartman"" starts off on a high note. Showcasing his memorable impressions such as Bill Clinton (I personally like his better than Darrell Hammond), Phil Donahue, Peter Graves, Ronald Reagan, Barbara Bush and Frank Sinatra (in the funniest sketch on the whole dvd) is a great way to kick things off. In fact, the first 45 minutes or so is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

However, there's a noticable drop in quality after the ""Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer"" sketch. Sketches like ""Anne Boleyn"" and ""Robot Repair"" are basically filler sketches added for time. Also, there are funnier Frankenstein, Tonto And Tarzan sketches than the one here, but they opt for their first appearance. I would havee loved for an ""As World Turn"" or ""Season's Greetings"" sketch. The only real keepers throughout this entire half are the end tribute and ""Cooking With The Anal Retentive Chef"".

If they wanted to make a great tribute to Hartman, they should have devoted the first half to his impressions and the rest to his many recurring characters. Phil had a lot of memorable and funny characters - Mr. Claymore, gay talk show host Russell Clark, Mace the convict, Susan The Transsexual, Helen and even Jesus (which is actually more of an impression depending on your beliefs). All of them are either missing are butchered to mere snippets in montages.

I was also very surprised that they didn't included ""The Environentally Conscious One"". This sketch was a parody of the movie ""The Wild One"" with Alec Baldwin in the Brando role, except he's a defender of the environment fighting pollutionist Phil Hartman. The best part of the sketch is at the end when Baldwin is about to ride off on his motorcycle while the town is being destroyed by pollution when Hartman jumps on and says, ""take me with you"". Hartman says it so funny and woman - like that Baldwin starts laughing. I truly expected it to be here (though I'm glad they kept the part in the ""Greenhilly"" sketch from the same episode where Baldwin and Hartman kiss each other).

Overall, this dvd starts off great but really loses steam toward the end. Hopefully they will release of volume 2 of Hartman's best (like Phil's 1990s' successor Will Ferrell, although his second best - off was a lot less funnier than his first). Maybe then they can spare us a complete sketch of his Charlton Heston impression or maybe the ""Dating Game"" parody on ""Sprockets"" where he played Susan. Until then, this will just have to do.",1110067200,11,3014,4.733333333333333
194533,4,1573626171,"While this compilation is not as consistently funny as the Will Farrell ones, it definitely has its moments.  Thought he did a great imitation of Donahue (banging the mike on his head, while waiting for an answer was a good touch).  The funniest bit (I thought) was the 'Robot Presents' skit.  Every time it came back with another title for the show, and the robot explaining that the title doesn't reflect what the shows about, I laughed harder and harder.  When he came back with 'Let's Fix, Robots', I literally fell off the couch, because I was laughing so hard!  And the Anne Boleyn skit was very well written....especially when she keeps asking what will happen to her head after she is killed (Phil: your body will then be folded up and shot out of a canon....Candice: will my head then be shot at my body?).  I also throughly enjoyed the nice sendoff at the end, with him and Jan Hooks imitating an elderly couple, thinking back to their younger days.  And knowing he never made it to old age makes it especially touching.  I'm not sure, but I think that's Bing Crosby's voice he's singing to.

Some sketches I thought dragged was Clinton in McDonalds.  The Barbara Bush skit didn't work, and the Sinatra skit was so-so.  The worst one was the opening with Adm. Stockdale....ugh, that couldn't get over fast enough.

So, all in all, a definite keeper.  It's nice that you can just fast forward thru the bad stuff, and watch the funny bits.",1109548800,,1447,4.583657587548638
194534,5,1573626171,"I have to admit that, aside from the original cast, my favorite SNL cast was the Phil Hartman-Jon Lovitz-Dana Carvey era. Such talent, and Phil Hartman was one of the best. Even though some of the targets of his impersonations have faded from memory (Donahue, Adm. Stockdale), his immense comic talent would make them hilarious to one who didn't know who these people were. Others, though, are truly marvelous--Frank Sinatra hosting The Sinatra Group was perhaps my favorite, Bill Clinton visiting a McDonalds was an excellent, if a bit obvious, choice. I smile when I think of his talentless propaganda-movie actor being told by Jon Lovitz that he's not needed anymore, or his Duke of Norfolk talking to Anne Boleyn (Candice Bergen) about possible execution methods. What can one say about his short film with Jan Hooks? It's not necessarily funny, but it is a striking moment, and an indellible image.

Since I was still in grade school when Hartman was on the cast, my only knowledge of his talent before this was the occasional episode on Comedy Central. So, I can't say that I am the ultimate authority on what Hartman did on the show, but that made the DVD more worthwhile for me. I do wish that the Reagan Iran-Contra sketch had been fully included, instead of just a snippet, but I have that one on tape. Although I'm sure that everyone will have their opinion on what they consider to be Hartman's best work, but I think that this DVD represents a good portrait of the man's work, and why he is still regarded as one of the most talented cast members ever on SNL.",1109376000,,1572,4.654676258992806
194535,3,1573626171,"Such a talent and yet not the best clips selected.  His best skits were the satires of others (Frank Sinatra, Admiral Stockdale, President Clinton).

194536,4,1573626171,"Phil Hartman is one of SNL's best, and this DVD does a fair job of capturing his talent, but, like most of these recent SNL DVD releases, it is definitely lacking. If you're a big Hartman fan, you should buy this, but if you're looking for a DVD packed with non-stop laughs, you may be disappointed. This one starts out strong, but dwindles in comedic value by the end. The extras are OK at best, although I did really enjoy the audition extra, which again, if you're a huge Hartman fan, you'll definitely want to see. Overall, there's nothing wrong with this DVD, I had just hoped for more going into it. It would be a definite buy for less than $10.",1103414400,,651,4.344262295081967
194537,4,1573626171,This volume clearly shows how wonderfully unique Phil Hartman was.  My favorite skit on this DVD was Unfrozen Cave Man Lawyer.  I would like to see at least another volume or two from the SNL archives on Phil.  I don't believe they even scratched the surface of his best past performances.  Some of the videos shown here were just snippits of performances.,1097366400,16,356,4.693548387096774
194538,4,1573626171,"When Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife, he left behind something that nobody could take from him - his legacy. As possibly ""Saturday Night Live's"" most versatile star, he was a major influence on later, equally great castmembers Will Ferrell and Darrell Hammond (who is the only castmmebrs whose Bill Clinton impersonation matched up to Hartman). As always, when he died, Lorne and company decided it was time to put together a tribute show as they did for Chris Farley. The resulting ""The Best Of Phil Hartman"" was mixed at best.
The first half is hilarious. Here, he gest to show up his versatillity in such roles as Frank Sinatra (""The Sinatra Group""), Bill Clinton (""Clinton At McDonald's""), Peter Graves (""Discover The World Of Science""), Phil Donahue (""Donahue""), and ""Barbara Bush (don't know name of sketch, but features Nancy Reagan (Jan Hooks) trying to take back the White House). Also, there's a great montage of his impressions. He became so well known for playing Bill Clinton, people forget that his repetoire included Ted Kennedy, Andy Griffith, Telly Savalas, Michael Caine and even Jesus. Also, there's his infamous ""Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer"" and one, the ""Weekend Update' ""All Drug Olympics"".
But after this, the dvd falters. While ""Cooking With The Anal Retentive Chef"" ""Succinctly Speaking"", and the touching closer ""Love Is A Dream"" are worth viewing, the second montage (don't know what it's about), ""On Broadway"", ""Ann Boleyn"" and ""Robot Repair"" rank among the worst ""SNL"" skecthes ever.
Is this dvd worth viewing? Yes. But is it perfect? By all means, no. How could it have been better? First, they could've taken out the entire second half (with the eexception of ""Anal Retentive Chef"", ""Succinctly Speaking"", and ""Love Is A Dream"") and replaced it with the ""Sinatra Duets"" sketch, another Clinton one, and a montage of his voiceovers. I think Phil Hartman deserves a best - of, volume 2.",1089417600,6,1917,5.031446540880503
194539,2,1573626171,"I read all the reviews of this, and i found the one extremely negative one and figured it was just some moron that didn't know what he was talking about.  After buying this and watching it, i realized that he was way closer to the truth than any of the other reviewers.  This dvd contains about 4 funny sketches, tops.  I remember phil hartman being way funnier than he is portrayed on this dvd, and i have a theory as to why this one stinks as bad as it does.
-Phil Hartman is an extremely funny and talented actor, but for some reason he was written in as a funny ""side guy"" in a lot of sketches, and the ones where he is the main character, he is usually doing an impression of someone or it is just plain boring, for whatever reason.  Therefore, to see Phil Hartman in his top form, you would be better off buying Adam Sandler's, Mike Myers', or Chris Farley's dvds, because theirs probably have all the sketches in which we remember Phil Hartman being so funny.  The only sketches left by the time they got around to making Hartman's dvd were the ones we would have been better off forgetting.  The only things worth watching on this dvd are ""cooking with the anal retentive chef"" and ""the all drug olympics,"" which is about 10 seconds long.  I hate to write a review like this because i really loved phil hartman, but it is a shame that i would rather watch the ""bad"" ones on the will ferrell dvd than the ""good"" ones on this dvd.  Sorry.",1086825600,24,1444,4.283088235294118
194550,4,1573626171,"For 8 years, Pil Hartman kept America laughing as one of (if not the ) most versatile castmembers on ""Saturday Night Live"". Judging by his long line of work, it would be hard to find just 20 sketches that would qualify as his best. In 1998, shortly after he was murdered by his wife Brynne, Lorne Michaels and Company came up with ""Saturday Night Live: The Best Of Phil Hartman"", which was soon released on dvd. The results were okay at best.
The first half is hilarious. ""The Sinatra Group"" is my favorite, especiially the Sinead O'Connor (Jan Hooks) jokes. Also worth a view are ""Clinton At McDonald's"" and ""Discover The World Of Science With Peter Graves"", in which Hartman plays the screen veteran as a bumbling idiot (so gold is long and thin like, say, Kareem Abdul Jabaar?). Best of all, there's a montage of his impressions. So many people watch him for his Bill Clinton that they forget his repitoire ranged from Ted Kennedy to Burt Reynolds to Jesus. After the ""All Drug Olympics"" sketch, the dvd falters a bit, but enjoys a resurgance of hilarity with ""Cooking With The Anal Retentive Chef"". But skecthes like ""Robot Repair"" and ""On Broadway With Brenda Krouse"" just weren't as good as I expected. The final sketch is ""Love Is A Dream"", a short film with an ending that will leave you misty - eyed.
Overall, not a bad set, but it could have been a better sketch. For instance, where was the sketch where he's Frank Sinatra and he's recording his ""Duets"" album and he doesn't like his partners?",1085961600,7,1504,4.594795539033457
194551,1,1573626171,"First off, the 1 star is for the 10 minutes of extras.  They are the only material half funny on this entire DVD.  I sat in total shock as I watched the first chapter, then the next, and the next.  I kept saying, this is going to be halarious, you just wait.  It was very painful to watch.  For one of the most talented actors to come out of SNL, they picked the absolutely worst episodes to show.  The opening segment was the most boring, unfunny scene he's ever done.  What were they thinking??I know there are many of you out there right now saying, ""hey, he's absolutely right, it sucked!"".  Maybe that's why it took so long to release his compilation; Maybe all the good episodes are still tied up in his estate litigation, or.. someone maybe couldn't make up their mind on what was funny and what wasn't.  The people that put this DVD together should be taken out back and stoned by Phil's true fans.  If you want a great example of showcasing a talent, watch Chris Farley's SNL DVD......You'll laugh yer ass off start to finish.  All I can say is I wish I could get my money back because this was absolutely terrible!!!  I hope I can get $5 for it at my spring garage sale, but I seriously doubt it! Shame on SNL for releasing this goop.  Even Will Ferrel's wasn't as polished as Farleys or Meyer's or even Sandlers DVD!!  No wonder SNL sucks now, it has run it's course and their compilations get worse and worse. You'll agree, the best ones were the first ones....right?

194552,5,1573626171,"Phil Hartman was a genius, to be simple. He can do anything he was asked to do, whether it was Bill Clinton, Frank Sinatra, or The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, he was arguably the most versatile actor on ""Saturday Night Live"".
The cold opening on this dvd, featuring Hartman as General Stockwell and an almost unrecognizable Dana Carvey as Ross Perot, just goes to prove my point. And while he only appears in one sketch, he was undoubtedly the show's best Clinton. In ""Clinton At McDonald's"", he captures the scandal - ridden former president to a t. He also does great as Frank Sinatra in the hilarious ""Sinatra Group"". Towards the end though, the dvd does start to hit the skids, but over all it's an excellent representation of his eight years on ""Saturday Night Live"".
Extras include a photo gallery, audition tape, dress rehearsal and outtakes. I also recommend all the other great best - off's sets out there, namely Dana Carvey, Mike Myers and Adam Sandler.

The Sinatra Group-this is the best skit! He does a great Frank Sinatra impersonation! He's crack about O' Connor are hilarious!

After much trouble finding this video (Amazon, by the way, was the only place I could find it conveniently), I was thrilled to receive it in a matter of days.  It was great to see so many of his legendary skits and many older ones that they reruns may not air.  I loved his impersonation of Phil Donahue.  His classics are great too: the annal retentive chef, unfrozen caveman lawyer and, of course, Clinton.
