8128255,5,B000G0O5A0,My grandsons love watching this DVD.,1459814400,,36,5.166666666666667
8128256,1,B000G0O5A0,"That is what I would tell someone if they asked me if they should buy this dvd. Hard Hat Harry is THE most irritating ""actor"" I have ever seen. Anything interesting that could have been learned from any of these dvds, is overshadowed by the horrendous acting and god-awful host. We bought several of these at one time and my husband and I just can't stomach them enough to watch them with our son.",1374537600,,397,4.378378378378378
8128257,5,B000G0O5A0,"My 3-4 year old just loves these series and will sit for hours if we let him as he watches them.  I have to say that he does learn things on them all.  It does give a good overview of things he sees like trucks, ships, etc.  He particularly likes the military one.",1296345600,,264,3.943396226415094
8128258,5,B000G0O5A0,"This is our son first ""All About"" DVD. Since then we have bought several more of ""All About"", ""Hard Hat Harry"", and ""Mighty Machine"" series. He has been watching this DVD since he was 3.  He is now 5 and still watching it, 20 or more times already! This DVD features Hard Hat Harry, a magical ginnie, that can take kids anywhere they want to go.  I like the songs and find it entertaining. This is our favorite ""All About"" DVD so far.",1273449600,,434,4.216867469879518
8128259,5,B000G0O5A0,"The All About series of DVDs has been great for our son - he can now rattle off so much information he learned from them, and sings many of the songs from the DVDS.  The Military one is very good.  While the military could be a difficult topic to cover for young children, the product's focus on the neat-o super equipment (in my son's words), the equipment capabilities in difficult environments/conditions, etc. is very informative.  The All About Space is particularly loved by my son, as he is a space nut.",1244073600,6,510,4.582417582417582
8128260,4,B000G0O5A0,Hard Hat Harry is a great series of videos.  Our son can sit and watch the same ones over and over and doesn't seem to get bored of them.  He learns about things that he wouldn't have otherwise known.,1231632000,2,200,4.102564102564102
8128261,4,B000G0O5A0,"These 2 episodes teach kids interesting facts about both Military vehicles and the NASA shuttle program, including the required training.

I would have preferred it not to include the imaginary device of a ""genie"" and the use of ""magical powers"" for the story-line...kids have enough imagination, and interest in such topics that the extra silliness scripted into the dialogue is not necessary.",1171843200,6,394,5.354838709677419
