Few people are as wildly idiosyncratic as Khan. Most Bollywood is like any other national cinema, a bunch of people who have very similar styles with very little to differentiate them as artist. It's why almost every movie at Cannes tends to be a downer drama about the working class made by rich kids who have never worked. Feroz Khan is the exact opposite. I can spot a Feroz Khan movie a mile away.

Feroz indulges his Feroz-i-ness here. The Russian style film editting is pushed hard. His obsession with male bonding is evident. Also, his pushing of sexual boundaries is on full display here. Bollywood is a culture where kissing on the lips is akin to having been in Gaspar Noe's Love or Vincent Gallo's Brown Bunny. Feroz gives you a rather risque lesbian belly dancing sequence in a brothel here involving Hindu and Muslim women before the Muslim hero kisses the Hindu heroine on the mouth multiple times as the movie goes on. It seems pretty daring as there are movies from Bollywood now that are rather loathe to show any kind of kisses, which seems to be changing just a little bit.

It also leads to the interesting poly-religious elements that pepper all his films. They have less to do with religion itself than they do the culture and economic impact of the religion. The hero is Muslim but it's cause he's from the poor caste instead of the lighter skinned upper castes. Basically, he is born out of Hinduism. He marries a poor Hindu girl, gets married in what looks like a Hindu ceremony and adopts many Hindu cultural elements. He basically is gangster Ghandi towards the end.  Again, he's way less interested in the theology as he is the way the religions interact by class and how ones religion changes in India by your standing within it. It also is seen as a way to escape and move up through a different route. All of his movies display it a little differently too. He seems to not hate any of them.

The story itself is pretty ambitious too. It's one of those life of movies. One thing about it that I find interesting is that it seems dangerously close to some real life Muslim gangster who ended up basically supporting terrorism in the end through the Mumbai bombings, shootings, and even supplying bombs for the first World Trade Center bombing. It was a simpler time back in the 80s before the whole globe was dealing with Islamic Sharia extremists.",1476748800,,2543,4.5701754385964914
