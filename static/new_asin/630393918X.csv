738143,3,630393918X,"Eccentric is the word for this documentary. Diane Keaton's interviews are much more interesting than the insterted stock footage and strange music which makes it hard to become involved with the subjects. However, 1987 was a more experimental time, and it was her first foray into her own style of filmmaking. If Diane Keaton as Annie Hall is your favourite character, I think this would be Annie Hall's way of making a documentary-decidedly odd. La-de-dah! For a more standard documentary made just two years later covering a similar subject I suggest 'The Big Bang' by James Toback. I would suggest watching 'Heaven' first, though, as it is not your normal interviewer-subject talking head type of documentary. Rather, like Diane Keaton, it's in a class all it's own.",1218672000,,769,5.062992125984252
738144,3,630393918X,"This Diane Keaton-directed film is better as an idea than as an actual movie. It's an Errol Morris style documentary asking people what they think heaven will be like, and the transparent goal is to ridicule as many people as possible, many of them with obvious mental problems. It's fascinating to see the variety of ways heaven is depicted in clips from old films (Spencer Tracy's ""A Guy Named Joe"" is the classic ""walking-on-clouds"" vision of the hereafter), but the rest of the documentary is Keaton seeing how many bizarros she can squeeze in per square inch, and how many tilted camera angles she can acheive doing it. Interesting in places, but not her finest moment (try ""Unstrung Heroes"" for that).",1163030400,,707,4.851239669421488
738145,5,630393918X,"I wish I had the time right now to do justice to this film.  Diane Keaton is a genius and her film describes Hollywood's apprehensions of heaven better than anything else before or since.  We witness various Hollywood film and television discussions and depictions of heaven.  We meet and listen to a variety of opinions on heaven by folks who live in or near Hollywood.  ...  The result is astounding.  Not only hilarious, this film is deeply moving.  It asks questions about heaven of its subjects, whose answers comprise the bulk of the film.  And it leaves each of us with those same questions.  ...  How will yours compare to those you've been fed by media machines?  ...  This is a film that, contrary to some of the reviews below, deserves multiple viewings.",1134864000,,765,4.669172932330827
738146,3,630393918X,"I was hoping to get some answers rather than a series of unsupported opinions.  This film doesn't tell you what heaven is like, but it tells you the opinions of a lot of people who don't know any more than you do.

How can a film possibly tell you what heaven is like?  I don't rule out the possibility.  Things that seemed impossible decades or centuries ago are very possible now, and there are so many people who claim to have seen heaven during hypnosis or perhaps during a ""near death experience"".  So I was hoping to learn something new from someone who has had a real experience.

We are given a series of opinions, some more intelligent than others.  The single most annoying of those opinions came from a dogmatic Christian who insisted on the acceptance of Jesus Christ and all that rot.

Some very interesting questions were raised, like if there is sex after death, and if there is a hell, but no real answers were given that I can take as being authoritative.

So this film isn't really an exploration of whether there is a heaven, but rather an exploration of people's opinions on the subject, and as such, it is of limited value.

The best you can say is that it may be thought provoking entertainment.

I recommend a book called Journey of Souls by Michael Newton.  That's not about opinions.

My favorite part of the film came near the end, when the subject of love came up, and we were shown some heart warming examples of people in love.  The second half of the film was better than the first.",1127520000,,1512,4.450909090909091
738147,2,630393918X,"A friend of mine recommended this documentary for me, making it sound very interesting.  When I sat down to watch it, I was baffled that anyone of Diane Keaton's stature would even be proud to have made this annoyingly edited documentary.  This was created for the ADD afflicted among us, as anyone who has a longer attention span than a few seconds is going to find the jumping around too annoying to be enjoyable.

There are some gems in the documentary, as it is interesting to hear people's take on the afterlife...but it would have been nice to have a name and what they do in subtitles.  Watching it, I didn't know who these people are, why they were lucky to be selected for Diane Keaton's documentary, and what ""expertise"" they have to represent humanity on the nature of an afterlife.  The whole documentary comes across as nothing more than an actor's vanity project.  Interspersed with this poorly filmed interviews (with odd looking backgrounds and weird angles, in which half a person's face was cut off the screen) are old footage from films long forgotten (though I think some footage seems familiar to me, such as the classic ""Metropolis"" from the 1920s).  Perhaps the biggest cringe-inducing moment for me was the film clip of an extremely racist and stereotyped old film showing African Americans in heaven, eating freshly killed chicken and hiding inside watermelons, dancing around with nappy hair and big lips...its just unbelievably racist footage, though we shouldn't forget that this once passed as acceptable entertainment in our country.

The documentary is divided into segments, with such themes as ""is there love in heaven?"", ""is there sex in heaven?"", ""can you prove there's a heaven?"", and even discussion on hell.  The only bits I liked in this documentary were hearing some people's view of what might happen to us when we die, and the old 1970s-ish footage of an evangelist in a light blue suit talking about his version of the afterlife.  Its amusing to watch all these people disagree and debate on such a topic, with all the certainty of one who has actually experienced death to come back.  I also liked the flaky New Age lady and some of her wacky ideas of communing with trees, two stoners discussing spirituality, and the one African American lady who presented the best idea I've heard yet (and agree with) regarding sex in heaven...that we don't need the physical act to experience the intensity of heaven, which will come automatically.  Right on, sister!  Unfortunately, this documentary isn't.  See it once if you're curious, but you're wasting your money if you buy it.",1107388800,,2616,4.889140271493213
738148,4,630393918X,"The subject sounded cool, but I was hesitant with someone as mainstream as Diane Keaton directing.  Wow, this blew me away!  If you're hardcore religious and can't laugh at yourself you may have problems with this. But to hear the variety of people interviewed interpreting their view of what heaven is, as well as death and other related, hard to discuss topics is hilarious and sometimes touching.  I can't believe the soundtrack Diane used, it's like a watered down version of old Ministry/Skinny Puppy.  I had know idea Diane was so hip, specially when you consider the year this was made, which I believe was 1987.  If you like stuff like the Awful Truth or Errol Morris docs, you definitely should check this out.",1077753600,,719,4.766129032258065
738149,5,630393918X,"Keaton's first directed film is one of the funniest, weirdest and best films on religion that I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of 'em. Some of the folks interviewed are downright scary, others naive & silly, but all of them seem sincere. Highlight of the film is an argument between an atheist punk teen and a longhaired Jesus freak who talks about cows being God's lawnmowers (thus don't eat the lawnmowers). Several of the old film clips woven throughout are forever in my head, especially the deranged voice of a preacher screeching ""ARE YOU AFRAID TO DIE?"" yells over footage of buildings collapsing, dams bursting, car wrecks, etc.
For me, this film is better than any of Woody Allen's movies, except for ""Sleeper"" which is even crazier. This film itself is a sleeper that will likely get a lot more attention years down the road. The fact that Keaton directed it makes the viewing all the weirder. In America's culture of total fear of everything it's a film worth watching.
If you have a sense of irony, can appreciate the juxtaposition of heartfelt interviews with bizzare religious film footage, and can ""get"" this level of hilarious film making, this one's for you. If you lack these critical viewing skills please give your copy of this film to someone who does, it's a brilliant, must-see movie!",1072828800,,1312,4.758771929824562
738150,4,630393918X,"This is a fascinating, playful, and scary film.  Most of the interviewees were obviously selected for their entertainment value, so there is not much of the ""man/woman on the street"" feel, unless the street happens to abut a fundamentalist insane asylum in the French Quarter.
I enjoyed laughing at the many assorted kooks until I remembered that the majority of Americans probably share their views.  Evolution has some catching up to do. Check it out.",979257600,,453,5.026666666666666
738151,4,630393918X,"Actor Diane Keaton made this unique little gem, way, way back, consisting of some really strange ancient b&w ""heavenly"" footage, and  interviews with all kinds of folks regarding their personal views on sex in  heaven, angels, God, and all stuff celestial. Particularly notable is the  two guys arguing about how one can believe that God exists, in regard to  how one can believe that they actually have a physical brain in their head,  even though none of us has ever actually seen our own. Brilliant argument!",967939200,,511,4.895348837209302
738152,4,630393918X,"If you're a lousy listener, you definitely won't dig this film, because Keaton's technique is to simply turn on the camera and let people talk about...Heaven. What it's like, who gets to go there and so on.
But if  you think it's interesting to hear real people say what they really, truly  think about something as important as the  afterlife, you'll find this  movie fascinating. I did.
Can you imagine? People talking with absolute  certainty about a place they've never been. Their desire, their hope, or  more accurately their FAITH that they are absolutely correct in their  visions of Heaven is almost palpable
No matter what you believe Heaven is  like, it's wonderful to see how wildly that varies from somebody else's  idea of what it will be like. A place full of diamonds and jewels...a place  of absolute goodness...a place of impartial justice.
Sometimes it's  funny. Sometimes it's scary. Sometimes it's just weird.
In the end, I  found this film to be very moving. Because after watching dozens of people  talk confidently about Heaven, I realized that while they all had different  ideas, all of their visions boiled down to one thing: Heaven will primarily  consist of those things that are profoundly missing from their own lives,  be it material comfort, social justice or, usually, unconditional  love.
It made me realize that what we mainly want to have, is Heaven on  Earth.",949449600,,1397,4.92274678111588
7856678,4,630393918X,"This film for pure avant-garde satire, and finely done. So well done that it's stunning the critics of New York, and the industry, were fooled by it. They didn't get it. They gave it serious ""documentary"" attention.  What a laugh.  It flew right over their heads.  That's rather an amazing testament to the power of what Keaton did here. Imagine the crew of  ""Saturday Night Live"" having to explain their skits to the audience and the press. Hah! Not going to happen; artists don't explain their work,  They just do their thing and you get it or you don't.  Seems few got it.

This thing is pure performance art.

No one should EVER take the title seriously. Sheesh, isn't that obvious? That's merely the backdrop for an assemblage of New York characters, to show up and cut loose on camera.  And boy can they improv. These are not serious ""interviewees!  It's an assembled staccato, a long procession of hungry New York types, the Woody Allen crowd of New York and their wannabees, and many another character from among the boroughs who yearn for a camera and a moment of fame, including Don King and a procession of bible thumpers and acolytes.  Everyone in the world can give an option of some kind on such a grand and fantastical theme as ""heaven,"" and Keaton sowed that fertile field with facility and humor. Nice work!

Few even today get this film. It's rather a virtuoso spawned out of that scene in NY at the time.  And Bravo for it!

Keaton was clearly stunned so few got it.  And she lets it lie, as all artists must. What a let-down the world turns out to be actually so full of dullards and dimwits. And how ironic that is in perfect keeping with her film!  A satire of that condition which bites her at the box office.  That's rather grandly rich.  And this includes the lauded critics of the press.  Vacuous dilettantes it would seem.

No, this thing is chocked full of the keen energies of roving actors, hipsters, street comics and willing charlatans from all over, and I swear we see a young Julia Louis-Dreyfus (at minute 30:13) who was another aspirant protege of the peripheral Woody Allen scene, and we know her from Seinfeld, as Elaine.

That's what this film is, a fresh and novel cinematic piece of art. It has the power to mesmerize and hold us quite powerfully from the beginning, but it's overlong.  It's stunning that Keaton could keep up this pace for so long. This is too much for a theater but surely belongs among the libraries of cult film fans.  Even THEY have missed it, so far.",1512604800,,2514,4.5377777777777775
