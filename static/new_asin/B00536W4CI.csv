There are a lot of quick movements used here, mostly using the Aerobic step. And they don't really show you what to do before hand; you just jump right into the routine. And I'm fairly fit, using various work out routines, and for this one, I actually did all the modifications because I just couldn't keep up without tripping all over myself. And even doing the modifications, I was exhausted after 30 minutes.
I did this routine for a week, and didn't notice any loss in inches or weight as I have with other routines--which isn't always the goal, I know, but for me it is.",1402099200,,606,4.371681415929204
