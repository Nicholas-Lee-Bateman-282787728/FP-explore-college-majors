8620406,5,B00G3IYY7S,This is a really wonderful DVD.  I have been teaching ballet for 20+ years and have even studied Russian pedagogy for ballet but character has been difficult to understand from the teaching end.  Ms Stabrova does a wonderful job explaining many details that teachers need to know that I never really paid attention to as a dancer.  Thank you Inna for sharing your knowledge and experience in this way.,1497571200,,401,4.782608695652174
8620407,5,B00G3IYY7S,"I am a ballet teacher in Brasil and ordered this dvd, plus Character Class for Level 3 and Character Dance Class Syllabus for Level 1, because,  I will soon start teaching children Character Dance and -- even though I've had some experience dancing different styles as a professional dancer -- I need to learn more from an expert, especially how to conduct a whole class. Besides, there's no similar practical material to be found in my country. The dvds are being extremely helpful, they are very didactic.",1487548800,2,507,4.827586206896552

I would recommend this class not only to students, but also to teachers, especially knowing that this video is done by someone who understands methodology of Vaganova School.",1383782400,2,254,5.195121951219512
