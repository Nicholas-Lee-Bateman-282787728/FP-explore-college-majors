My ancestor William Caldwell Sublett, AKA ""Ben"" Sublett, is the subject of one of the segments in Volume 1.  It was disappointing to find absolutely nothing new ""uncovered"" in this video but it was very pleasant to see snippets of my grandparents and great-aunts and uncles on screen, stuff  I DON'T already have in my family albums.
The biggest complaint I have for this product is that it sold out and is no longer available.",1353715200,,616,4.80188679245283
8255723,5,B0014HMQF0,If you are the type that searches for coins after a winter storm on the beach; you may be the type to really appreciate this great show on lost treasure. Its a great late 1950's gem that sadly only lasted one season. If you are debating whether to buy a metal detector or not to find coins and jewelry then this is the show for you.,1217203200,,332,4.045454545454546
