7963938,3,B0000687M1,"There was some good acting here, but I wouldn't call the cast a slam-dunk. As another reviewer noted, production and acting quality is on par with a lower-budget made-for-TV movie, especially (appropriately) those made in the 80's and 90's. But definitely watchable, even so.

The basic story is of a video rental business owner who is pushed out of business by the wheels of corruption and zealotry. There are some interesting twists and turns along the way, including surprising moments of violence considering the supposed offense the owner has committed (but then, isn't that always how it is with zealots?).

The movie does seem to have difficulty figuring out its tone; I don't mind mixing it up a bit, but when a movie seems to flip-flop back and forth between a light-hearted buddy-cop style movie (with civilians taking the place of the cops) and a suspenseful thriller, it may be trying too hard, exploring too many extremes. That said, on the whole there's a real story being told here, and that it could be even partially based on real life is distressing.

Sad to say, I'm not convinced that things are really that much better today. I would not be surprised to find that our public officials and hate-mongering groups have just gotten better at covering their tracks.

It occurs to me that the film has in it a bit of the ""passion play"" structure. There's a close-knit group of friends, the sacrifice of one of the group, and the betrayal of him by another. Granted, it's a bit out of order and Jesus wasn't known for his thirst for revenge. So maybe I'm just reading too much into the script. But if it was unintentional, then I find the similarities all the more ironic. :)",1386115200,,1689,4.695945945945946

7963940,3,B0000687M1,I didn't like the way they mixed religion with politics.  It started out crazy but got little better at the end.  They sure could leave out the cussing.,1367712000,,152,4.392857142857143
7963941,3,B0000687M1,"This film seemed to me to have something missing-it was just ok it wasn't good or bad. Plus serious moments seemed to be interspersed with inappropriate 'comedy' moments, I couldn't quite work out if thie film was serious or a comedy. However, it was interesting and worth a look for anyone who likes true stories or ones with an 80s type theme.",1356566400,,345,4.580645161290323
7963942,4,B0000687M1,"The movie brings back those fond memories of biggest controversy of the 1980's: VHS or Beta-max. The era when only two types of people wore large crosses: Madonna fans and terrorists. This film is set amidst of the era when the far political right gained power by murdering abortion doctors, protesting evil Disney films, and manipulating DAs. Mike (Matt Letscher) and Diane (Sarah Brown) open a successful chain of video stores. In spite of the fact these stores closed down most of the adult movie theaters in the world, the religious right was upset it was renting a video entitled ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" to people who wanted to see the movie, unlike the protesters who never saw the film. Rather than toss the movie out, Mike and Diane decide to keep renting the film under some obscure law seeming known only to liberals as ""The First Amendment.""

Now personally I would not consider this film worthy to draw a line in the sand over. In my neighborhood they stuck the film in the adult section and claimed to have removed it from the store. This film progresses at a good clip. The drama wasn't overly intense. There was some minor humor to keep the subject matter from getting too dry.

Tony Todd plays a minor role as Chuck Berry. This was Chlo Grace Moretz debut film, and she doesn't have much of a role.

The movie tosses in an F-bomb with some sex and nudity (Katelin Chesna) which was a bit disappointing. Not that Katelin was disappointing, but that they had it in the film to begin with. It really didn't add anything to the film and could have easily been done without it, reaching a younger audience.",1339977600,3,1625,4.596551724137931
7963943,5,B0000687M1,"A wonderful film, well deserving of the awards it won and many more. This superlative film is based on a true story. It's not really a story of revenge though. It's much more: It's a powerful and touching account of how, even against terrific odds, justice can manage to prevail, and uplift and even change the human heart. Don't be surprised to learn that the production of Heart of the Beholder is a very meaningful labor of love -- this actually produces a special quality that shines throughout so that the audience senses that something truly different and remarkable is going on here.",1227225600,4,590,4.737864077669903
7963944,2,B0000687M1,"This movie has garnered plenty of self promotional support, festival screenings the last three years, and heartfelt arguments against the naysayers. In my five years of being a movie store owner and reviewing films, this one appears to the most difficult for me to find impartiality.

DVD: The DVD had a fair quality transfer, with the camera artifacts, mic sounds and lighting shortages showing up throughout; ironically, the best clarity appeared in a brief segment at the paintball sequence where they changed cameras. The DVD promo was a wash of other films that would be hard pressed in finding distribution, and the slide show segment pushed more of the films obvious slant (understandably).

Cast: The cast is made up of a ""where did I see that actor before"" every few minutes, including pros from Star Tek NG, General Hospital, Ally McBeal, Third Watch, Three's Company, etc. The film resonates like a Lifetime movie both in film quality and production, but with the nudity, sex and language.

Film: I spent more time watching the background props (posters, cases, store fixtures) as the first 20 minutes reminded me of how I started in this business. The Chuck Barry tie-in was a surprise, as was seeing Beta beating VHS in customer count. The whole premise is actually very sad and scary, as I would have reacted much differently had it been my daughter. The acting was painful at times, but I know this was a passion piece, and Sarah Brown had one of the best scenes showing her abs without fear or makeup (bedroom 3-way scene at the end) - not common in Hollywood.

I have had a religious group boycott my store before over carrying documentaries, so I empathize with the story. I will be carrying this film on my shelves as I feel it is a necessary story to relay, albeit the message is told with a ""local"" feel. Have no expectations, roll your eyes a few times at the forced schtick, but give it a try. NOTE: had I not been an owner I would have said skip it.

Thanks for the info Mr. Tipton.",1214006400,3,2006,4.6394366197183095
7963945,4,B0000687M1,"Marketed as a controversial true story. This independent film was written, produced and directed by Ken Tipton (whose life it is based on) delves into the lives of a small community in St. Louis, Missouri where a once top notch computer specialist, Mike Howard, gives up a lucrative job to follow an entrepreneurial dream. Mike is one the first people to open a video rental store in 1980.

Success is slow to come but it does come. With it comes the sanctimonious escapades of a group of religious harlots with their own agenda. They begin to target Mike's ""Video Library"" with a vengeance when he refuses to remove movies from his store that they deem inappropriate for human consumption. Movies like Hail Mary, Splash and The Last Temptation of Christ. When legitimate campaigns don't work the leader resorts to black mailing a local prosecutor into destroying Mike's and his family's livelihood.

This movie is very disturbing on one hand but entertaining on the other. The recognizable actors (Matt Letscher, Sarah Brown, Michael Dorn, Jason Wiles, Priscilla Barnes) are great and so is the filming. Surprisingly, many scenes are delivered tongue-in-cheek, like when an adult movie from Mike's ""Video Library"", submitted into evidence, is shown to the jury members.

If you take all the religious goop out of the way, it's a simple story about man who hits rock bottom, how he chooses to react to it and how he fights his way back after loosing everything he thought was important to him. He comes out of a dark tunnel with a fresh lease on life.

I watched the film at the online Heart of the Beholder web theatre which took me pretty much all day (as they were cut into 72 1-2 minute scenes) but I couldn't tear myself away. I sure wouldn't pay the $200 'rare' cost that is being sold in the third party area but you can buy an online version from the official website for $7.99 or a physical copy can also be bought or rented from the site as well.

Heart of the Beholder is an interesting movie delivered with taste and humor. Our personal freedoms are often taken for granted in the day-to-day and this film is a good reminder of what we should appreciate. I will admit it is a little one sided in perspective and this film certainly wouldn't appeal to everyone. Now I don't know if it's a ""true story"" but I enjoyed it and recommend watching it.

Although not from the mainstream film company, you would not know this from watching this movie.  It was done very well.",1139011200,8,254,4.6
7963947,3,B0000687M1,"I finally got around to seeing Heart of the Beholder.

The movie was very engaging. It follows Mike and Diane Howard from before the birth of their first child. Their hopes for a better life are realized when Mike's gamble of opening a video store blossoms into a popular video store chain.

That's where the problems begin. A local religious splinter group targets the Howard's video store chain for offering blasphemous videos such as Tom Hanks' ""Splash"".

When Mike refuses to cave to their demands, their leader blackmails the DA into creating charges against them. There are death threats against his little girl, and things get just plain ugly.

Justice prevails, but it was too late. The weight of the legal expenses crushes the Howard's dreams.

I don't want to spoil it for you, but how the Howards get revenge is hilarious. Check it out!",1126656000,12,847,4.813793103448276
