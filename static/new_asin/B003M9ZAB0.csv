8400330,1,B003M9ZAB0,"Seriously dissaponting, 1st off, I thought it was a book, It's a DVD, oh well, so I played it, i think it was over in like 20 Minutes, or so it seemed. I thought this was gonna be an insiders look at one of golf's legends. Instead what i got was every thing i already knew. Seriously, I saw his press Confrence on TV, its on here, I saw Parnevicks interview, on TV, Yes, its in here. They said he went to Stanford. I knew that back in 95. I didn't learn a thing i didn't already know. But i guess people wanna make a buck from suckers like me. Just think for a moment, its Title, Prodigy"" An UNAUTHORIZED story on Tiger Woods. To me it implies i'm gonna learn something new and actually be entertained. The only thing i learned was i wasted $13.49.  Nice work Infinity Enternainment Group!! The only one being Entertained is your Bank portfolio. Nice way to whore out Tigers name and not provide anything remotely resembeling substance.",1297468800,4,936,4.379310344827586
