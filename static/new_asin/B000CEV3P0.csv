2460719,5,B000CEV3P0,"I just viewed this movie last night with my husband and we thought it was THE BEST! I feel it deals with REAL families and emotions, right down to the ""farts"". I didn't realize Paul Reiser was such a talented writer. He turned out a movie that didn't once make me feel that it was contrived or stilted. It was like being with the family---a family that cares and shows anger and fear and frustration and LOVE. And it shows us that we CAN grow and change AND still love and support each other.

It was one of the best 98 minutes we've had together right up to and including the tears we shared at the end. Right on, Paul Reiser! Don't let anyone convince you otherwise, this is THE REAL DEAL!!",1148860800,8,692,4.242424242424242
2460720,1,B000CEV3P0,"The synopsis on the back of the box made this sound like an intelligent, thoughtful movie.  It lied.  In my book, nothing lowers the intelligence level of a person or movie more efficiently than a constant barrage of swearing and cursing, particularly the F-word.  The barrage didn't let up and I willed myself to sleep a little more than half-way through.  Husband watched the rest of the movie and filled me in later.  He informed me that the cursing didn't let up.  Reiser's character was the worst.  Funny thing, his character never swore at home around his wife and kids but did everywhere else.  My life observations tell me that this is a very unrealistic scenario.  What could have been a thoughtful, intelligent movie was destroyed in it's quest for the all-important PG-13 rating.  It's not as if it spent a lot of time, if any, in the theatres anyway.  Bad move.

Aside from the mindless cursing: Olympia Dukakis - one of my favorite actresses, is hardly even in the movie.  Never saw her during the whole portion I was awake through.  Saw her in the closing scene when I woke up.  Husband said didn't appear much more than that.  What a waste of a great actress.  The characters of Reiser's sisters were funny however - reminded me a lot of the banter between me and my siblings.",1147219200,4,1291,4.592105263157895
2460721,4,B000CEV3P0,"This movie opens with a funny scene with a good monologue given by Ben (Paul Reiser) describing his father's talcum powder habit. We soon learn that Ben's mother (who is in her 70s) has left his father and has not disclosed her whereabouts to anyone.

Peter Falk plays Sam, the unfortunate husband. He has a heart of gold, although he seems to be quite difficult to deal with. What a character, though! In spite of his character flaws and thick-headedness, there is something very lovable about his personality. There are some really great scenes between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. Some are funny - and others are touching and honest, as these two men go on a ""road trip"" of sorts together.  These are two good men who seemingly needed this time with each other.

Ben's mother and father ultimately reunite, under unexpected circumstances, and the movie has a very sweet ending. Some of the characters in this film reminded me of members of my family, which made the viewing experience very enjoyable for me.  The characters are so relatable and so honest that I believe all of us will be able to relate to it, on one level or another. The movie is funny, quirky and entertaining. I would recommend it.",1146700800,5,1203,4.660377358490566

2460723,3,B000CEV3P0,"This just feels like one long couch session.  I don't know whether Rieser is exocising some family demons or what but there is nothing new or ground breaking here.  You should have done this, you should have done that.  Children always have the luxury of being sideline coaches after the fact, don't they?  Peter Falk give a great performance to a mediocre script and I rather have had a V-8.",1140998400,,392,4.557142857142857
2460724,5,B000CEV3P0,"Honestly, this is a rare gem that didn't get the attention it deserved.  Very few movies really nail a realistic family dynamic like this one does.  It's definitely one you'll want to own and watch every so often to remind you that your family isn't weird and that love is a good thing.",1139961600,2,286,4.377358490566038
2460725,4,B000CEV3P0,"""The Thing About My Folks"" takes a light-hearted look at the complexities surrounding the relationships within one family.  The story begins with the apparent collapse of a marriage, but then delves into an aging father and grown son getting to know each other for the first time during an extended road trip.

Paul Reiser and Peter Falk make a fine father-and-son team, bringing laughs and tears as they relive the past and talk about the future. The occasional curse or crude remark seem very natural as these two men explore their emotions together when they're unexpectedly forced to spend an excessive amount of time with each other.

""The Thing About My Folks"" is a small film -- a labor of love for actor-writer-producer Reiser.  As with most small films, this is a low-tech experiment in human emotions completely dependent upon the writing, acting, and directing.  In this case, all three elements come together beautifully, although the excessive chatter might disappoint more action-oriented viewers.

2460769,3,B000CEV3P0,"My husband saw this movie on a local tv channel and loved it, and he hardly ever watches movies!  So when he kept telling me how great it was and that I needed to watch it, I didn't hesitate trying to find it to buy it.  Couldn't find it anywhere for sale locally, so I found it on Amazon.  The shipping was super-fast and in great condition.  However, upon watching an ""uncensored"" version, the language is pretty rough--way more cussing than we will usually tolerate when selecting a movie.  But it has a great story and gives you things to think about long after you've watched it.

We laughed and laughed in this movie.  Peter Falk has some very truly great lines that he delivers hilariously funny and perfectly timed.  The chemistry between Paul Reiser and Peter Falk was what drove this film from beginning to end.  They gave excellent performances and you really got into their characters.  There are some sad parts also but overall the movie was a great movie that made you laugh, made you sad and everything in between.  I would recommend this movie.  Although, I will warn parents that I would not consider this a family movie, as there is language in this film that is not appropriate for children in my opinion.",1309910400,2,788,4.686131386861314
2460853,2,B000CEV3P0,"The script is bad.  Olympia Dukakis' appearances in the movie are slightly more than a cameo.  She is one hell of an actor, as is Peter Falk.

Paul Reiser made a mistake in not creating a documentary - something along the lines of ""A Day with My Hero.""  It would have been better for Reiser to have a one-on-one experience that we could enjoy.  There could have been several installations of this, including getting to go ""fishing with my hero.""

Many of us dream about spending a day, or more, with someone we admire.  Most of us would be awkward about it, if given the chance.  Reiser's film, and Reiser himself, are clearly uncomfortable.  And who can blame him?  He has done what we would  like to do, but don't have the access.  But he should have made it as completely personal as he really wanted the experience to be.  (I'd bet that he has many regrets about things he didn't get to say to Mr. Falk, or do with Peter Falk, and that's a pity).

Reiser made this film because of his adoration for Peter Falk, and, Mr. Falk was lovely to consent to do the film. The script is not good.  The direction is not good.  Time spent with a hero, on the other hand, might well have been brilliant, but I don't fault Reiser one bit for so much wanting to be part of the light and life of his star.",1285200000,,1293,4.237704918032787

2460895,3,B000CEV3P0,"The best thing about this movie is, of course, Peter Falk, but listening to him argue over and over with his son, always saying the same things, got a bit tedious, and the fart joke wasn't funny after the first time.  I was disappointed not to see more of Olympia Dukakis.

Still, an interesting take on relationships, and how we never really know our parents. Worth a look.",1198800000,,374,4.485294117647059
2460896,5,B000CEV3P0,"The movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father.

The brilliant dialogue, lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back layers.

The core issues of parenting, communication and manhood are explored indirectly.

In fun ways the curtain is pulled back, the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed.

2460899,4,B000CEV3P0,"Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us.  THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents.

Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background.  One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving!  Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members.  Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living.  The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of  Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending.  All is not what it seemed: it's better and, well, different.

Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film.

Well worth viewing. Grady Harp, January 07",1169337600,3,1620,4.517123287671233

My husband and I actually watched this together! A miracle! Too bad Hollywood is so invested in its big special-effects blockbusters like the 14th sequels to Star Wars or Mission Impossible that movies like ""The Thing About My Folks"" end up lasting in theaters for about two weekends.

2460903,5,B000CEV3P0,"The Thing About My Parents was a heart warming, insightful, and touching film about family life. I found the performances true to life and honest despite the fact that the film is written to be humorous. It is a moving story of a family in a ""crisis."" From that standpoint it cleverly reveals the meeting of generations forced by the sudden and unexpected. As the story evolves through a son meeting his father, perhaps the first time, the depth of illumination of family relationships is thought provoking, and the insights into relationships in general - parents to children, children to parents, brothers and sisters, males to females, and to some extent, the ""old"" days to newer days - was simply amazing and wonderful. My hat is off to Paul Reiser for a fantastic writing job and performance! Of course Peter Falk is always tops in my opinion - both for touching my sentiments and stirring my funny bone without being obvious. To the critics who didn't approve the profanity and ""crudity"" - woh! Where and how did they grow up? Aren't we all more profane and crude in the security and  privacy of our families than we are willing to admit much less want everyone else to know? Considering the context of the film I felt everything ""fit"" with straightforward and honest humor. We benefit from not taking ourselves SO seriously. I highly recommend the film for fun, for entertainment and for an insightful look into family dynamics and relationships. It gave my wife and I a lot to consider and talk about, and really got me thinking about my boys. I hope to beable to share the film with them. I would encourage folks to watch it, enjoy it, and then think about it. The humor is fun, not forced; the scenes that brought tears were sincere and not contrived. I do wish hollywood could get beyond the idea that people only do ""odd"" things because of life-threatenting disease; we all need to move beyond our fear of death and focus on celebrating life. I think ultimately that is what this film is about. I definitely plan to buy the film and enjoy it again and again.
