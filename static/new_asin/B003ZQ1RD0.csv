""mono 2.0  Region 2""  it is manufactured and sold in the UK.  Amazon had it shipped to me from the U.K.  Now what do I do with it?  Is there a way to play it, anyone?  Can I return it to Amazon or what?  If it can't be played in the U.S.A. then it is useless and I want a refund.",1393113600,,397,3.588235294117647
4235105,5,B003ZQ1RD0,"I saw this movie when I was 10 yrs old.
It was significant then because of two grand factors.
It was the very first movie I ever saw in colour...and wow...I still remember how vivid or oversaturated the colours were.
Secondly it was the first movie I watched in Cinemascope.
I couldn't stop talking about this movie for months.
The DVD copy is excellent condition and still remains one of my very special favorites.",1355529600,7,415,4.621621621621622

4235109,5,B003ZQ1RD0,"This is a unique movie, evoking something of a colonial Africa 50 plus years ago.  Made in 1963, it details the story of a 10-year-old boy who, after just having lost his parents in an air raid in Port Said (Egypt) during the Suez crisis of 1956, takes to the road on his own in an effort to reach an aunt he has never met before living in Durban, South Africa.  Vagabonding with a number of different characters along the way, the story takes a fairly unsentimental approach to its main character, Sammy, and the characters his meets. It doesn't have that ""Hollywood"" feel, although some of the soundtrack music in the beginning may have been a bit over the top.  Overall though it's a pretty engaging little story and not least into the bargain are a plethora of stunning views - the best in armchair traveling!

As to DVD production, the beautiful widescreen transfer is clear and the colors vibrant. On the con side however, I would have like to have had English subtitles.  Some of the different accents, not least of all British, had me struggling to understand at times. This added to the fact that sound effects volume often overrides the speaking.  Fortunately for the most part you get the gist of it.

Special features include a couple of interviews - a colleague talks about director Alexander Mackendrick, and the actor who played Sammy (Fergus McClelland) discusses the film.

Buyers should make sure they have a REGION-FREE player if watching in North America as this import disc is PAL region 2 for Europe/UK.

8410718,5,B003ZQ1RD0,"This is a magnificent story about a young boy who loses his parents in the Suez action of 1956, and sets out to find his aunt - who lives in Durban at the other end of the continent!. At his age he has no notion of the distance involved, but he has a little compass and he knows that it is south, so off he goes.

On his way he falls in with various people, some a lot more trustworthy than others. As a result he soon develops a highly suspicious nature, becoming very jumpy and inclined to take to his heels at the first sign of anything suspicious. This tendency to bolt first and ask questions afterwards almost certainly prolongs his adventure a lot more than it need have been, and I have a sneaking sympathy for the frustrated rescuer whose car the boy immobilised before escaping, and who (now a hundred dollars out of pocket) expresses a desire to drown the brat. But in light of Sammy's experiences, his attitude is not unreasonable.

The high point of the film is when Sammy falls in wit a loveable rogue (Edward G Robinson), who takes him under his wing and gives him his first bit of security since his long walk began. You can see the boy's self-confidence steadily grow, to the point where he saves his benefactor's life by coolly shooting a leopard when it attacks. The boy is now so happy that he wants to forget about auntie and just stay here forever.

But it's too good to last. Sammy's guardian is outside the law, and his new life is brutally destroyed when police come along and do their duty. If I recall correctly, this loss of his new ""family"" is the only time in the film where Sammy breaks down and cries. But it couldn't have lasted anyway, as his friend (after a heart to heart from his oppo Harry H Corbett) acknowledges that they have no long-term future together, and that Sammy needs to return to the world of school exams and qualifications. For this reason he harshly breaks off their relationship and gives information about Sammy to the aunt - though persuading her to let him complete the journey for himself.

He duly does, but now he's a different boy. Despite the brutal parting, he remembers the old rogue with fondness and asks after him, and in general has clearly made the jump from little boy to young man. It is either luck or a stroke of genius that the actor chosen for his part, Fergus Maclelland, is actually twelve rather than ten. Over the months of film making he gets noticeably taller, which is symbolic of how Sammy has grown, along the way - and by no means only in height.",1504483200,,2532,4.415417558886509
8410719,4,B003ZQ1RD0,"This DVD is a region B, PAL encoded DVD as opposed to the USA standard region A, NTSC encoded DVD. To play this DVD in the USA one must have a region B or an 'all region' player.

This is a 1963 movie that I remembered seeing and enjoying decades ago. The story line is about a 10 year old English boy living in Egypt in the 1950's who suddenly finds himself an orphan in the time of conflict. Without a clear understanding of where his closest relative lives except for a first name and a destination of Durban South Africa the boy begins a journey South that will take 5,000 miles to complete. A film of a boys adventure story with support from various adults who have various motives as to why they are helping the child. The film quality and acting are up to the standards of the time and the inclusion of Edward G Robinson as one of the adult characters bringing a pleasant surprise.",1483401600,,888,4.285714285714286
8410720,3,B003ZQ1RD0,"A really good movie but be sure that you have a ALL REGION DVD player.  THese DVD players can be ordered from Amazon a very reasonable prices.

There is a technical quality issue with the playback having video noise at the bottom of the screen in several scenes during the movie.
It may be just my copy.  I don't think it is the DVD player as 99 percent of the video is good quality.",1467849600,,383,4.148648648648648

8410723,5,B003ZQ1RD0,"My children and I were absolutely enthralled by the story - delightful locations, and a real sense of realty sometimes very harsh on the young child, but he is a trooper.  Reminded me of the African version of Empire of the Sun.  Gritty, real, desperate, overcoming some nightmare situations, beating the odds and the resilience of a child faced with the most harrowing circumstances.  A very interesting film for children and adults alike.",1423180800,,440,5.0

8410726,5,B003ZQ1RD0,"Great to see a story of this quality taken seriously and well acted by all. There is a strong central character: Sammy. The narrative revolves around him, and he is not dismissed by the other characters for being a child, as so often happened in other non-children's films of the era. This is important, because it shows the audience that Sammy is a real person, and it makes the audience more interested in what makes him tick. It also makes the other main characters more human. Thus the audience is drawn into, and involved in this tremendously strong small story. It appears however that some of the film was lost, as the film was apparently originally ten minutes longer. This is a shame because the audience becomes aware of the tiny leaps in the narrative flow. Still a great film though.",1403308800,,795,4.6453900709219855

The film is memorable for some passages but doesn't hang together as well as the book, which is able to get more into the boy's mind than the film could.

I was pleased to get the film and as usual Amazon did a great job in getting it to me.",1393200000,,313,3.727272727272727
