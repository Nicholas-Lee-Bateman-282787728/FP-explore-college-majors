8343424,5,B001UE7BYI,"Monkeyshine is an enchanting tale about love and adventure, following the hero of the story Jake Truman and the discovery of the legacy his grandfather has left him.
This film is perfect for those who have a love of the fairytale type story, pirates and romance.
All in all, Monkeyshine is a lovely family fun film.

Please note however, the dvd is currently in PAL format - so make sure your player is compatible before you buy! :)",1239408000,,432,4.538461538461538
