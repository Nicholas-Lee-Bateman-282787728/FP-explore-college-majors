3858471,2,B00275EHDM,"The movie starts off pretty quick. If your looking for Audrina Patridge then don't blink. She does what she does best: laying on her back, saying little, pretending she's dead, all for a big paycheck. Her cameo last all but less then fifteen minutes. Sorority sisters prank a brother of there sisters into thinking he slipped a girl a roofie and about to get lucky, but she pretends she's dying and they drag her to the middle of nowhere. The brother really kills the girl and after much arguing and wasting of time, they dump her in the abandoned mine shaft. It's been done before but then the movie just does a 360 and turns into a boring, lifeless film. No suspense was given and the kills were good but cut. Cut? Well, if you want to see them go extra bloody wait till the dvd is released in unrated, too scary for theatre version! The movie took way to long I thought and the ending was just plain confusing and stupid. They added so many possibilties but it all failed in a jumble mess. The ending spelled a sequel, which i'm not really anticipating.

While it's not the worst horror remake ever made, it was the most boring remake i've ever witnessed. It could have been PG-13 if they cut down the laungage.",1254096000,2,1214,4.419642857142857

[...]

 Mark Rosman's THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW was a very decent 1983 slasher movie : gruesome in the right places, with a strong final girl, efficient suspense scenes and a pleasingly surrealistic finale. It's not a classic, nor (until later this year) has it ever had a proper DVD release, but it is an 80's horror movie, so it obviously needs to be remade so that we contemporary audiences don't need to watch anything made before 1998.
  The new movie with a shortened title has token references to the older movie : it unfolds at ""Rosman College"", briefly features the bird-like cane that was a memorable murder weapon in the 1983 film, and has a scene of corpse-dumping. Otherwise, the moments that feel familiar in SORORITY ROW could have come from any number of 80's slasher films, and the elaborately nasty prank that triggers the plot is more reminiscent of the exposition in movies like SLAUGHTER HIGH. It's barely a ""remake"", and the opening titles confuse matters more by stating ""based on the screenplay SEVEN SISTERS"" - that being an early title for HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW.
  Curiously, the new film's core story and structure are very close to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and it has an almost identical group discussion scene before the body - dumping that sets off the slasher plot. It doesn't't directly reference other slasher movies, but its smartass attitude, in which characters in peril crack self-aware or callous one-liners, is very much in tune with the SCREAM slasher era of the late 90's. It feels like a film out of time - though, luckily, it has more to offer than most.
  The set up is as simple as you'd want. A bunch of really bitchy co-eds (all of them hot in some way, with one who pretends to be dowdy but we know the truth) unwittingly wind up with a dead sorority sister. This is the result of a prank that drives the prank victim to kill a girl, while, afterward, her friends decide that for the sake of their future, it's best to throw the body down a mineshaft and never speak of this event again. Eight months later, it's Graduation and, because this is 2009 not 1997, those involved receive mysterious, threatening text messages rather than notes saying ""I know what you did..."". A killer in a graduation gown wielding a pimped up tire iron, does them in one by one.
  Many of the clichs you know and love are present and correct in SORORITY ROW : mobile phones with no signal when you need it ; fake scares involving the medicine cabinet mirror ; a double twist finale with back-from-the-dead shenanigans. It's far from perfect : the killer, when he's finally unveiled, is fatally bland, and the climax involves a raging house fire that conveniently pauses itself to allow the protagonists to fight to the death with said killer without burning up.
  That said, it's often stylish, with a neat, visually striking malfunctioning-Jacuzzi death and an extended opening tracking shot through the sorority house (with clever hidden cuts) that bids to be the slasher movie equivalent of memorable moments in GOODFELLAS and BOOGIE NIGHTS. It's sharply written and acted, with a nice ear for the sheer bitchiness and scathing wit of teenage girls : the dialogue skews closer to HEATHERS than to regular slasher flicks, and the banter and intentional laughs are a lot of fun throughout. Carrie Fisher gets a scene-stealing bit as the gun-toting badass house mother (a totally different character to the crabby bitch in the 83 film) who says rousing things like ""He, she or it is about to get two rounds to the face"".
  Unlike a lot of the post-SCREAM slashers, this slick, well directed, fast-paced movie ensures that the exploitation movie expectations of the typical audience are fulfilled. This means a bunch of pleasingly bloody kills (stand-outs involve booze bottles and flare guns), and gratuitous boob shots that make you feel like 1983 never went away. It misses out on the genuine creepiness of Mark Rosman's under-valued movie, but this is still worth a look.",1253404800,9,4192,4.968571428571429
3858473,5,B00275EHDM,"I thought this was a really good horror/slasher film. As I watched this, I was reminded of the classic slasher films of the 80's and 90's! I loved the killer's outfit, it was really creepy and I loved the pimped out lug wrench that the killer uses. Rumer Willis did an awesome job as Ellie, and was the only girl I cared about. At a party held at the Theta Pi house, Jessica, Cassidy, Ellie, Claire, Chugs and Megan play a prank on Megan's boyfriend, Garrett. When the prank goes too far, Megan ends up dead and the girls throw her body in an old mineshaft, and swear never to speak of it again.

Eight months later on graduation day, someone wearing a black hooded robe comes to kill off all the girls who knew one at a time. During the graduation party is when things really begin to cook. Could it be Megan coming back for revenge? Or someone who can't live with the secret anymore? I highly recommend SORORITY ROW!!!",1253059200,2,920,4.348837209302325
3858474,3,B00275EHDM,"Yeah, I watched it!  So what?!  When you know what you're going in for, this kind of movie has many merits.  Sorority Row is a movie about a killer who meanders through an alcohol-soaked, drug-fueled, sex-crazed, sorority McMansion during the end of the year party indiscriminately butchering the tight-bodied, scantily-clothed co-eds - and their dufus boyfriends - who may or may not have knowledge of a murder cover-up involving a senior soror who got chucked down a well like baby Jessica.

Additionally, the cheese-covered horror rules are followed perfectly:  The phones get no reception unless receiving a horrifying, tension-increasing picture or video from the killer.  A dark, mysterious figure in a face-covering graduation robe, the killer is so derivative that I imagined the character holding the fishing hook from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer/dp/6305017115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>&nbsp;(IKWYDLS) and wearing the mask from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream-Trilogy/dp/B00004W20F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream Trilogy</a>, neither of which happened.  There is full frontal nudity that serves no other purpose than checking off the nudity requirement.  Characters who engage in illicit sex almost certainly die.  Characters who elicit groans or disapproval from the audience are guaranteed excruciating deaths.  And, finally, there is inevitably more than one ""twist"" to mislead the viewers attempting early killer recognition.

As for the characters, just picture IKWYDLS and replace the male characters with gorgeous, nubile, women in their early twenties.  It's the ""talented"" Megan (Audrina Partridge); smokin' hot Cassidy (Briana Evigan), the girl with the moral compass; Chugs (Margo Harshman), the sorority's resident slut (who is present in all real life sororities); the sexy Claire (Jamie Chung), fulfills multicultural standards for the sorority's funding purposes; the blonde vixen Jessica (Leah Pipes), who is as ruthless as she is beautiful; and Ellie (Rumer Willis), the slack-jawed, kind of ugly girl (but with a nice body) all sororities need for term papers and to increase cumulative GPA.  Aside from the main cast, there is an endless supply of hotties prancing around in lingerie (or less) and either dancing about in the soapy bubbles from an overflowing hot tub or having a feather pillow fight in pajamas with exposed behinds.  Read that last sentence again.

As for the plot, a sorority prank goes wrong, one of the sisters dies and the rest of the movie is about the characters covering up the murder, repenting their actions, or playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with a tire-iron wielding killer who appears to have an oral fixation.  Pretty standard, suspenseful stuff.

Aside from my belief that Ellie should have been the victim of the prank, thereby improving the possible skin-to-film ratio, the directing, acting, special effects, and all other aspects representative of any number of recent Hollywood horror flicks are sufficient.  No awards will be won, but I'd probably watch it again for hot chicks and bad jokes.",1252972800,31,3239,5.85531914893617
3858475,4,B00275EHDM,"My number reason for seeing this movie had a tire iron stuck through her chest after five minutes.

A coverup ensues, and eight months later when all are due to graduate, suddenly the dead bodies of those responsible start to pile up, but who is the killer with the Swiss Army pimped up tire iron, and the hooded gown?

Whoever came up with this movie must have had these movies in his dvd player.  The antagonist wears a large hooded graduation gown, similar to the other two movies, although in Sorority Row you start out with multiple protagonists.

I have to admit that this movie does grip you and does not let go, and I could really feel my tension increase at certain points, so that was very well done. It has multiple protagonists so it's difficult keeping track of who's who, although as get you further into the movie it does get easier.

A point of interest in this movie is the presence of Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce, and Demi Moore, who emerges as the protagonist later in the movie.  She gives a good performance, and she does stand out among the other characters, does not particularly dazzle, yet does have considerable promise.  I wonder if you found this helpful.",1252800000,7,1788,5.790076335877862
3858476,3,B00275EHDM,"Is ""Sorority Row"" supposed to be a straight-up horror film or a very dark comedy? There are times when it tries to be both, and I admit that some of them are successful. I find this odd, given the inherently unpleasant nature of the plot, which involves five sorority sisters, a sixth sister who was accidentally murdered, and a cloaked psychopath on the prowl. There are a few select moments that genuinely seem to be addressing the plot's absurdity, as when an exasperated Rumer Willis sobs, ""We are so dead! We are so dead!"" and an unsympathetic Leah Pipes responds, ""No one's dead! Well, Megan ..."" But then there are the moments too ridiculous to be enjoyable, as when the sorority mother, played by Carrie Fisher, wanders the house in search of the killer, blasting holes in the walls with a shotgun. If there's anything this movie doesn't need, it's broad, desperate humor like this.

The long and short of it is that ""Sorority Row,"" a remake of the 1983 film ""The House on Sorority Row"" (a.k.a. ""Seven Sisters""), has moments of style but is really no better than your average teen slasher film, all silly setups, gruesome deaths, and implausible conclusions that go for shock value and nothing else. Those audiences only interested in female nudity will be pleased to know that one topless scene finds its way into the film, and now that we've established that, let's get back to business, shall we? It's a classic case of trying to guess the identity of the killer, who stalks the young sisters of Theta Pi while hidden underneath a hooded graduation robe. When we finally learn who the killer is, we can't help but feel disappointed because this person (and I won't say if it's male or female) had nothing much to gain. Truth be told he or she wasn't all that involved to begin with.

It begins, as many such stories begin, at a wild and crazy party, where girls have pillow fights on trampolines and beer practically flows out of fountains. In the midst of this revelry are six Theta Pi sisters: The protagonist, Cassidy (Briana Evigan); the self-appointed and mean-spirited leader, Jessica (Pipes), who has her eye on the son of a prominent senator; the shamelessly bulemic Chugs (Margo Harshman), who willingly sleeps with her therapist for pills; the brainy Ellie (Willis), who cries at the drop of a hat and can't seem to handle the situation she eventually finds herself in; the beautiful Claire (Jamie Chung); and, finally, the ill fated Megan (Audrina Patridge), who fell victim to a prank gone wrong.

You see, it was discovered that Megan's boyfriend, Garrett (Matt O'Leary), has been cheating, and as Jessica firmly asserts, ""You cheat on one Theta, you cheat on every Theta."" To teach Garrett a lesson, they instructed Megan to fake a seizure, and after Garrett ran to the sisters in a panic, they played the part by frantically getting Megan into a car and worridly trying to drive to a hospital. They then announced with horror that she died, which meant, obviously, that the body had to be taken somewhere remote and dumped.

Oh, but that Jessica; she just had to suggest that the dismember the body so as not to leave evidence. Garrett, still under the impression that Megan was actually dead, took a tire iron and jammed it deep into her neck, apparently trying to decapitate her. Now with a real dead body to deal with, Jessica took over, forcefully trying to convince her remaining sisters that to save themselves and their families from a lifetime of hardship, they had to dispose of Megan and move on with their lives. ""What about Trust, Respect, and Honor?"" Cassidy says, remembering the Theta Pi motto. ""You're forgetting the rest,"" Jessica coldly responds: ""Secrecy and Solidarity."" And on that note, Megan is wrapped in a blanket and unceremoniously dropped down an empty well along with the tire iron.

We know flash forward eight months, when, in the midst of graduation and celebration, someone is sending the remaining sisters video footage from Megan's cell phone shot the night she was killed. Pretty soon her jacket shows up. So does the message ""Theta Pi must die!"" which was written in blood at the bottom of the well. And that's when the bodies start piling up. Is it possible that Megan didn't die, that she's now back for revenge? If not, then who else knows the guilty secret of the Theta Pi sisters?

And that's pretty much all I can tell you. Something might have developed here were it not for the general disconnect between the film's horror and comedy. Much of the latter is reserved for Jessica, who's given dialogue so sarcastic that it quickly loses its appeal. But the film's biggest problem is following a routine most are simply tired of. Consider this setup: Ellie, sent to retrieve more alcohol for a party, descends into a dark, dank basement all alone with nothing but a flashlight to guide her way. Right after saying, ""Hello? Anyone there?"" the batteries in the flashlight fail. The music takes an ominous turn, and ... well, you get the idea. Having recently sat through two truly terrible horror films, ""Halloween II"" and ""The Final Destination,"" I can say with complete honesty that ""Sorority Row"" isn't quite as bad as they are. Unfortunately, that's the best I can offer in terms of a recommendation. You want a typical slasher? You've got one.",1252627200,6,5314,4.770652173913043

3858480,4,B00275EHDM,"This female-powered slasher film tells the story of a group of sorority sisters who find themselves being stalked by an unknown maniac one year after they accidentally killed one of their sisters in a prank. For these girls it will take the power of sisterhood to survive the killer party in store for them.

This 2009 remake was a bomb at the box office, despite its hot cast and great throwback to classic slashers. It features great kills, and witty dialogue, but what stands out the most is its female cast.

Typically in slasher film, there is usually more focus on certain characters than any others. While we do have a focal character, each female in the film is considered a lead have their own chance to shine.

First up is Briana Evigan who stars as Cassidy. Cassidy is our focal character who we supposed to root for and relate to the most. She is the conscience of the story, has the most strength of the girls, and isn't afraid to stand up to whatever or whoever is in her way, and truly loves and wants to protect her fellow sisters.

Next is Leah Pipes who stars as the not so nice girl you cant help but love, the queen bee, Jessica. Jessica is the character that isn't afraid to say how she feels, even when its at the most inappropriate moments. She is definitely the character that really only think of herself, but shes also a strong woman in her own way and isn't afraid to take a stand (she has no problem taking an ax to go after their assailant). But even when she has the chance to run, she doesnt leave her sister behind.

Rumer Willis plays Ellie, the brainy one. Despite the fact that she is typically seen crying and screaming and panicking through the film, Ellie is a lot stronger than she actually thinks.

Jamie Chung plays Claire, Jessicas sidekick. She wants to be like Jessica, but it doesnt take her long to see the error of her ways and wants to break free from her role as the sidekick and become a stronger and better person. Shes also not one to take any crap from her boyfriend (whos a total jerk).

Finally theres Chugs, played by Margo Harshman. Chugs is the drunk sister who knows who she is and quite frankly isn't ashamed or afraid to express it. Like Jessica, she says whats on her mind and doesnt sugar coat things.

So, even though certain characters make have more screen time than the others, each of these women have their own time to shine and show their female empowerment as leads. They could be strong from beginning to end mentally and physically, some have to come into their strength, and some have inner strength and self-confidence that make them just as strong as the others.",1462665600,,2638,4.46985446985447

Where is this college and how soon can I apply?! Every guy and girl featured in the film, with the exception of Carrie Fisher, could be models, despite being well passed the age of most college students.

The girls decide to cover up the incident and put it behind them, but at a large cost to their sisterhood. A year later, at the same party, someone knows what happened last year, and have decided to make the whole Sorority pay for their crimes. This film is a classic 'who done it' mashed together with a slasher film, and the results are pure excitement. The truth is that most of these film don't have much in the way of a story line and the killer is obvious to everyone, but not this time.

Both versions are about a group of sorority girls who prank someone.  Then the prank goes south and they're left to pick up the pieces.  Ive never seen the 1983 version, but I have seen this one.  And here is my take on it

Its the start of senior year at the fictional Rosman University.  The sorority girls at Theta Pi are celebrating with their 1st party of the senior year.  Adding icing to the cake, they decide to play a prank on Megans cheating boyfriend Garrett.  And everything seems to be going well until Garrett kills her for real.  Then the girls agree not to go to the police, hide Megans body and go on with their lives.  But fast eight months to graduation day.  Someone doesnt want their secret to stay hidden..

Sorority Row was fun, but predictable.  I wasn't really surprised by the turn of events in the movie.  I have to say, though, the kills were quite impressive.  They were gory, but not overly so.  Megans death scene was well-acted.  The panic, desperation from Ellie and Cassidy and the other girls as they tried to save her life was very well-done.  Very stylish.

The acting itself was okay.  The best performance for sure belongs to Leah Pipes, who plays the leader and ultra-bitch Jessica.  Usually, you don't root for the bitch.  But I found myself doing just that in Sorority Row.  Yes, Jessica was a social climber, a mean girl and incredibly self-absorbed.  But she was also tough, resilient, smart and take-charge.  And in her own way caring.  Leah Pipes did a great job at bring these qualities to the surface.  She was also the movies main source of comic relief.  This wasn't your stereotypical character.  Briana Evigan was decent as Cassidy.  The others weren't bad, but they didn't really stand out as much.

Director Stewart Hendler put together a stylish, shiny package.  Like I said before, the movie was pleasing to the eye.  Its just that weve seen it all before.  Id give a 3.5/5

The typical b*tch character takes it to psychotic levels, at one point making a joke about the corpse of her friend having ""looked better"". The supposed ""good"" protagonist shows only the bare minimum of decency by not letting the other girls get away with a death they were about 95% responsible for which is pretty much useless as she also stood by and let it happen, and the other friend of note is a bundle of neuroses who hyperventilates for about 5 minutes after the act which she should've saw coming a mile away. I'd feel more sorry for her if not for the fact that her little fit was surprisingly devoid of tears, and she seemed more concerned about jail time than the death of her own friend.
The main plot is kicked off by one of these vile excuses for human beings being incensed that her boyfriend who she had cheated on, had also cheated. No, I am not kidding.
This poor sap is tricked into believing he had killed her, and the leader of the gang convinces him to ""take care"" of the supposed corpse.
In a mix of confusion, shock, pain, and rage, he does, only to find out he had just killed her for real, and becomes increasingly tormented and even suicidal throughout the film, and also gets hit with a car by the b*tch. He was one of the only sympathetic characters, the other of which being a target for slut-shaming by the movie and characters wherein.
This movie and it's characters(save those two) are ultimately just unpleasant, to the point where I was disappointed that so many of the heroes were alive at the end, and was looking forward to an ending where the bad guy won.
Some of the deaths are cool, and I was grinning ear-to-ear when the b*tch got stabbed through the mouth and skull. Vicious, brutal, and darkly hilarious. That's really one of the only good parts in the movie.

The word ""Sorority"" carries a lot of baggage in movie titles. I don't need to tell you what it's supposed to make you visualize; suffice it to say that it leads you to expect a lot of nudity fronting for a show that's pretty dumb. Not here. Oh there's a fair amount of nudity, although not as much as most Greek life films usually provide, and it's sexually quite raunchy, but the underlying story is anything but dumb, and this creative team realizes that story incredibly well.
The first part really had the feel of those movies, ranging from Will You Rather to Devil's Dozen to Truth or Dare that set out to explore human nature by putting a gang of interesting characters in an unimaginable situation and seeing what happens. Usually it doesn't work because the creators of the movie aren't as good at coming up with good characters as with wild scenarios, but in Truth of Dare and even more this movie, high caliber acting work and a great (though sometimes too elaborate) scenario come together to form something greater than the whole of its parts.

3858596,3,B00275EHDM,"You gotta love a movie that starts out with college girls jumping on a trampoline in pj's having a pillow fight. Clearly the writers know the formula for a successful slasher movie. The sorority girls are intelligent and snarky. Roofies? ""A great way to have sex and get a good night's sleep all at the same time.""

When one of the boyfriends of one of the girls cheats on him, they opt to play a joke on him. His gf pretends to be knocked out from roofies while he initiates sex. Then she vomits fake blood and pretends to die. In a fake panic the sisters take her and the unsuspecting bf out to a remote area to bury her, although she is not dead. In Hitchcock like fashion the boyfriend, Garrett, throws a wrench into the works...well okay a tire iron, but it had the same effect. Now with a real corpse, they decide to cover the whole episode up.

TV actress Leah Pipes plays Jessica. She is the blond ring leader of the group. Her dad is running for the senate. She is opposed by Cassidy (Briana Evigan of ""Burning Bright"") who has a raspy Demi Moore voice. Rumer Willis (daughter of Bruce Willis/ Demi Moore)plays Elle. She is the girl who goes along with everything. She wears glasses in this film which makes her look like Emma Stone on a bad hair day. She is the one that doesn't sound like Demi Moore. Jamie Chung, whose career has taken off (no thanks to this film), plays Claire as every movie now needs its token oriental babe, something Jessica makes clear. Margo Harshman plays chugs and rounds out the group of sisters because they needed a fourth to carry the body and dump it down a mine shaft, as Cassidy wouldn't help. Chugs is the drunk and slut in the group. Guess who dies first? In order to ensure her silence the sisters tell Cassidy she was the one that killed Megan (Audrina Patridge) as opposed to Garrett(Matt O'Leary).

Then the killing starts. The movie is about who lives, who dies, and who done it. Caroline D'Amore plays dead Megan's sister Maggie who is going to start college and decides to pledge the same theta pi sorority because we need one more killer suspect to prevent this from becoming a Scooby-doo mystery. Carrie Fisher plays the House Mother. She lets us know how far down she has fallen since being a princess.

Unfortunately this is just a me-too slasher film and doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Now if they had a better sound track that worked with the film and maybe a scene of Carrie Fisher with some Star War memorabilia, we could have bumped this up a notch.

3858597,4,B00275EHDM,"Possible Spoilers

If you took ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Urban Legends"", put both films in college and made the students even stupider than the cast of the first ""Summer"" movie then you would have ""Sorority Row"". This sounds like a major slam against the film, but while not great it is fun to watch and most of the women in cast are quite good looking, which makes it easier on the eyes for those who enjoy that kind of thing.

It starts out with a few sorority sisters playing a prank on a guy who cheated on one of them, so one of these sisters pretends to be drugged and then she ""dies"". The sisters burst in and try to come up with ways to get rid of the body and decide to dump it down an old mine shaft. The guy however ends up actually killing her (Audrina Partridge, ""The Hills"") and of course the remaining sisters make a pact never to tell a soul what happened.

Now a year later these sisters are looking towards graduation, but things start to get weird, the girls all start getting pics and text messages from someone who was at the scene of the crime and unless you've never seen one of these films its very predictable from here on out. Someone is killing the girls who were there on that night and despite all the red herrings its obvious who it is. The death scenes are somewhat creative and the gore is good if not spotty.

The cast is average for a horror film, though again most of the girls look great, especially Briana Evigan (""Step Up) and Jamie Chung (""Sucker Punch""). Nice cameo by Carrie Fischer (""Star Wars"") as the head master of the sorority. The best part of the film is the opening sequence and a couple of the scenes afterwards, then its typical horror stuff.

I personally enjoyed the movie, its not great, but its fun and goes by at a quick pace. **1/2 out of 4 stars.",1320019200,,1817,4.270348837209302
3858598,3,B00275EHDM,"SORORITY ROW

Ah remakes, those pesky little things they just keep on popping up on us. Well this one is a few years old but still I think you know what I mean. This of course is a remake from the slasher pic ""House on Sorority Road"" and is not all bad. I went into this expecting another horrible film and came out kinda liking it. Now it is not a classic and I don't think you will find anything new here, but it is ok.

From the title I bet you can guess this is college related and is about none other than a sorority. Yes indeed I know that is a shock but that is what it is about. And like any good horror flick it is about a group of females, you know what that means. You guessed right kiddies, lots of blood, death, and naked girls; I know it doesn't sound that bad. The film follows a group of sorority sisters that play a prank, said prank goes wrong and a fellow sister is dead. Of course from there the ""ladies"" and the prank victim decide that they should dump the body as not to ruin any graduation plans and life after school. The leader of this group is particularly all about image and not going to jail, that makes her kinda fun.

Time goes by and it is graduation time which of course means party time, why not,  you only killed a so called ""sister"". So like any good teenish horror flick a killer pops up and knows what these girls have done. Will the killer go to the police with the information, no silly, said person would not be named killer for no reason. So the girls start to get threatening texts and videos and stuff to their phones. This of course only leads to multiple deaths in various ways.

Now I have to say one thing first off, I could never take a killer seriously if they started texting me. I am not a texter and refuse to read them when some one sends me one, therefore I wouldn't even know there was a killer after me. If some one has something to tell me then they can call me. Any way as for the deaths this is a pretty good flick but everything else is your typical new age horror flick. I will say that the first part of this film is really good. The build up to the prank and the entire prank scene are really well done, and the aftermath at the scene is just as strong if not stronger. Everything after that is just your typical flare.

The acting is everything you would expect from this type of film, which is good because that is what this type of film calls for. The leader of the sorority is wonderfully evil here, especially in the aftermath scene of the prank. Any way this is a good enough flick for a rental I would guess and who knows you may like it better than me. Was this a classic, no, but was it fun, yes.",1318204800,,2670,4.08587786259542

While Stewart has a few smaller directing gigs before this one Josh and Pete have both had a lot of experience, though in television. Sorority Row is another one of the horror remakes that hit the big screen in 2009. You would think with how much money is clearly being funneled into the horror genre with the slew of remakes being put on screen we could get something original for a change. This film is a modern day ""re-imaging"" of the 1983 classic slasher The House on Sorority Row. By re-imaging it is clearly a brand new film and not a real re-make of the classic. I will give it credit though for doing one very important thing - not caving to get a PG13 rating. While the gore is light the content is strong enough to deserve a R rating and I for one am of the opinion that all horror films should be rated the same way.

The film opens with a group of sisters from Theta Pi are having a party, though it is one with an agenda. One of the girl's has a boyfriend who recently cheated on her and they plan on having a little fun with having revenge against him. They come up with a prank that makes it looks like he kills her and when they go to dump the body (where they were going to reveal that it is a joke) he ends up stabbing her while trying to dismember the body - actually killing her. They make a pact to never speak of it again and everyone lives happily ever after.

Well that would make for a boring film so let's say happily ever after lasts until the end of the semester when someone starts calling everyone that was involved in the prank telling them they knew what had happened. At this point we follow a pretty standard modern slasher film that was unfortunately pretty predictable. The only real surprise was who ends up being the killer though aside from that wasn't trying for anything groundbreaking. Which in a way works as the classic sorority slashers were a fun watch but still I was hoping they had found a way to update the formula to bring us something new. Still, the ability to have the characters believably work together or fight among themselves depending on their personality fit together well.

While it wasn't a bad film it wasn't something that you are going to find a lot of replay value in. While it wasn't the greatest horror film in the world it was a `remake' (and again I use the term lightly) that at least was able to carry itself with a decent plot and acting that didn't make you cringe to watch on screen as so many of the recent ones have suffered from. I do have to give the director bonus credits though for casting Carrie Fisher as a bad ass `house mother' to the girls who always had an answer. At very least the writers were able to get some credit on the film as they are currently in the works of writing what will clearly be a masterpiece - Piranha 3-D.",1301788800,,2894,4.2967032967032965

dis-robe and scream. this boring tripe had little dis-robing, but a lot of screaming.
and what a performance by STAR WARS' CARRIE FISHER. i guess the economy makes one do things they wouldn't normally do.

One of them is being cheated on by her boyfriend. A fact discovered at another  alcohol and drug filled party. They play a prank on the cheater and convince him that he has  killed his girlfriend. They all set out to dispose of the body and end up at an old mineshaft

The cheater takes the ""Body"" outside of the vehicle. and one of the girls jokingly mentions that they ought to Let the air out of her lungs so she doesn't float to the top. Do you know what Einstein does then? takes a tire  iron and stabs his girlfriend in the  chest jn an effort to do so.  ITS A  DEAD BODY AS IN THE PERSON  HAS STOPPED BREATHING AS IN THERE IS NO AIR IN THEIR LUNGS!!!. HOW STUPID CAN YOU GET???.  his girlfriend dies for real.

Someone starts killing people from the sorority  mionths later.

That's a lot more  effective than leaving town or staying at home or transferring schools. That would be tooo suspicious. No. if I commit a lot more murder  I can hide my involvement in this one  murder a lot better than if I did any of that stupid stuff. Yay. I'm a genius.""

3858622,2,B00275EHDM,"The original ""House on Sorority Row"" was not a great or classic film in any way. It didn't really stand out from most of the other slasher films of the 80's and was somewhat forgettable. This remake didn't really have that much to live up to. This 2009 remake actually comes across as inferior to an already average at best film. In the original the sorority girls accidentally kill their house mother who they hated in a prank gone wrong and this is what sets up the later bloodbath that is to come. In this one they use the prank gone wrong idea again but this time a girl pretends to have OD'ed and freak the guy out who gave it to her. The guy thinking she's dead starts to chop her up so he can burry her only to find out that she was still alive.
To me this just seemed like a ripoff of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and other modern teen slasher films from the late 90's onward. The film then goes on to a typical murder mystery as to who is the killer as they are one by one picked off. Sorority Row basically just copies most of the cliches of slasher films such as making sure the minority doesn't make it through the film(usually a Black character but this time an Asian). Other than the death at the beginning there aren't any really standout kills in the movie. Some good things this film has to offer is for one most of the girls in here are at least kind of hot and a second is that I changed my guess maybe twice over who the killer will be.
This film is watchable as a cheap rental or if it's playing on TV but nothing worth going out of your way for. Overall it's a forgettable and cliche'd slasher film that fails to stand out with the current crop of slasher films or with the 80's ones either. Sorority Row fails to live up to the already low standards from the original 80's slasher film.",1290038400,2,1814,4.15625

I was surprised to see that it is only a remake of the original ""House on Sorority Row"" in its simplicities.  I was so glad they did not copy the same narrative as the first.  Both the original and remake are about a group of sorority sisters covering up a secret only to be punished for it later.  Other than that the movies are different.  This remake is sassy, funny, over-the-top scary. How would I describe this remake to young horror fans who have never seen the original?

Not because it was scary, but because I was afraid it would fall into the catagory of all the other ""slasher"" movies of the time.  So it took me time to actually get up the courage to watch this.  SO, I finally did and I am actually glad that I did.
  The character dynamics is what you would expect from a slasher flick.  The primary character became evident quickly in the first twenty minutes.  You found the character you couldn't wait to bite the big one, and guessing the killing order was more exciting then some of the dialogue.  For most guys they love seeing hot chicks half naked though certain scenes.  I am happy to say that none of the main characters ever showed more than a bra.  Which is a nice change of pace.
  There were a few great lines and good moments in this movie.  Carrie Fischer as the House Mother rocked, her line, ""I live in a house of 50 psycho bitches, I'm not afraid of you,"" was awesome. Another awesome part of the movie was seeing Rumer Willis look like her parents when she uses a shot gun.  Briana Evigan, the main character is great.

The acting is the only terrifying sight to behold. The script, written by a couple of creepy looking dudes in their late 30s, strains way too hard to keep churning out bitchy one liners and snappy quips (""Take it easy Lezzie Lohan."") that never pay off. And, as is the case with nearly every other modern day slasher film, when the killer's identity is finally revealed you find yourself going ""That person?"" ""Really?"" ""But why?"" In other words it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Oh, and the second to last scene has the obligatory moment when the ""last girl(s)"" walk towards the camera in super slo-mo as an explosion goes off behind them and one of the crappy anthems from the soundtrack blares over the speakers.

It's pledge week at Theta Pi and a cruel prank is about to go horribly wrong. 6 sisters come up with a plan to get back at a guy who two timed one of their own. They give him roofies, or so he thinks, to slip her so he can make love to her comatose body. But when the girl suddenly starts convulsing and throwing up, the guy freaks. He runs for help and, along with the other 5 sisters, loads the body into a van which is presumably headed for the hospital. Instead the sisters take a detour and wind up near an abandoned well. Content with letting the boy, who happens to be the brother of one of the other sisters, cry his eyes out and convince himself he's just murdered someone, the girls giggle and go along with their prank until the voice of reason, Evigan, decides to put an end to the shenanigans. Before she can reveal the ruse, the boy takes a tire iron and impales the still alive sister. As everyone looks on in horror, the girl dies for real. There's a quick cover up planned, a' la 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', and the body gets dumped down the well. Cut ahead to 8 months later. It's graduation day at Theta Pi. As the graduates gear up for a big party, they receive a troubling text - a photo of the tire iron used in the murder. Shaken but not troubled enough to stop their drinking and hooking up with random dudes the girls continue with their party preparations. When a masked killer, cloaked in a graduation gown, shows up at the party wielding a ""pimped out"" tire iron, heads start to roll. It's up to these once inseparable friends turned bitter enemies to stick together and figure out who's taunting them and trying to pick them off one by one.

The only thing that comes close to making this movie a guilty pleasure is Carrie Fisher as the girls' stern, hard drinking house mother. Not only does she come armed with some deliciously bitchy one liners, but watch out for when she gets hold of a shotgun and sets out to protect her bratty charges. Her scenes are easily the most entertaining in this sorry movie. And for any Patridge fans who wanna see their girl act, beware that her screen time is limited. I mean really limited.

Although they admittedly could have given the killer a different look than the hooded black graduation gown (which obviously looks like the Fisherman garb from I Know..), the first obvious difference is that I Know What You Did Last Summer was all about a car accident killing a pedestrian, and Sorority Row involves a rather edgy prank getting violently out of hand.  The main differences, though, are in style.  I actually liked I Know What You Did Last Summer when I finally saw it (I avoided it for a while, thinking it was going to be another Scream-type self-parody, which I'm not really into), but I Know was more...I don't want to say 'light' because that sounds like a putdown and I don't mean it as such...it was more of a mainstream, horror-tinged thriller, whereas Sorority Row is a much sharper, edgier, horror slasher - sometimes sexy, sometimes intense and bloody.  A good point of comparison might be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valentine/dp/B00003CXUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valentine</a>, or imagine a darker version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cutting-Class-Unrated-Version/dp/B000UO4F8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cutting Class (Unrated Version)</a>.

  After the break-up of a Theta Pi sorority sister named Megan (Audrina Patridge) and her boyfriend Garret (Matt O'Leary) after he cheated on her, she and several of her friends plan a prank to get back at him - she'll pretend to get back together with him at a party, they'll be making out upstairs and she'll have a fit from something she took (here's the one angle of the movie that rubbed me the wrong way, and I'll get to it in detail in a minute), and will apparantly die.  Then the sorority sisters, including Garret's sister 'Chugs' (Margo Harshman) will stumble upon the scene and convince him that because it was an accident he's not to blame but nobody will believe him, therefore they better dispose of the body.  Exactly how far they plan to go with this isn't clear - it appears to have not been thought out in depth.  But to everyone's horror, it goes a lot farther than planned after a drive out into the country when Garret rams the sharp end of a tire iron through Megan's chest so the lungs will collapse and the body will sink easier in the lake.

  Panic ensues.  Ellie (Rumer Willis) and Cassidy (Briana Evigan), the two sorority sisters who weren't actually part of the planning or executing of this genius scheme, along with Claire (Jamie Chung) are in favor of going to the police and trying to explain.  Jessica (Leah Pipes), unofficial 'queen bee' of the Thetas, leads the camp opposed to 'fessing up, champions the cause of going ahead of getting rid of the body, and manipulates/wheedles/bullies much of the rest of the group into going along with her.  Only Cassidy is the hold-out, but Jessica circumvents this by slipping some evidence onto Megan's dead body.  If Cassidy goes through with her threat to go to the police anyway, she'll be the only one connected to the corpse by evidence and the rest, Jessica insists, can just say they never had anything to do with it or even knew about it.  That's the set-up, and while I realize it probably sounds like I've said too much, that only covers the first ten to twelve minutes.  The rest of the movie unfolds with a pretty high number of twists, with several possible leads as to the identity of the black-clad killer but no blatantly obvious red herrings and no characters hanging around who you can predict will turn out to be the killer just because they have no other real role to play.  It plays out less predictably than one might expect, and although the 'ominous messages' start in advance of the killings, the killings themselves all take place on one day and night, helping with the movie's fast-moving flow.  It also helps because you don't have a situation where people are getting killed for a week straight but no one notices that the college population is getting pretty sparse.

  All the aspects of Sorority Row have been handled with care.  The acting is high-quality, the movie just looks great visually, the characterization is full and realistic on both the characters you like and the ones you can't stand.  The killings are highly effective.  The dialogue is inventive and believable, the movie has a high sexy edge, the girls are gorgeous, and there's real suspense.  Carrie Fisher adds a lot to the movie as the Thetas's dorm headmistress Mrs. Crenshaw (they didn't turn her into the stereotypical 'token uptight authority figure', instead letting her be a fully developed character), and Caroline D'Amore is just terrific as Maggie, Megan's spunky and strange sister who's preparing to start at the same college next year.

  Okay, now the bad.  It's got to do with the initial prank, as I alluded to earlier.  The masterplan of having Megan pretend to get back together with Garret and then die of an accidental overdose has this added little angle: Megan and Chugs cook up a plan where Chugs will give her brother Garret a placebo drug, but tell him it's a date rape drug, and encourage him to slip it to Megan to help speed their reconciliation along (that's what she 'overdoses' on).  And he goes along with it.  Ouch.  Along with destroying any sympathy we might have for Garret after he sees his girlfriend apparantly die and then again after the incident with the tire iron, it takes the whole prank angle, already edgy but in a good way, and then moves it into sleaze territory.  There are other places where Sorority Row goes over the top a bit, but in these instances it's going over the top in the right directions.  The date rape drug angle, even though it's techincally a Fake date rape drug, should have been left out, in my opinion.  Does it cripple the whole movie?  No, not at all.  But it is a chink in the armor.

  The movie succeeds in recapturing its footing surprisingly quickly after this misstep and goes on to be a hot, vicious, winning horror movie.  Definately one of 2009's most under-appreciated efforts.  9/10, could have been 10/10.",1269907200,5,7028,5.026770293609672

And speaking of Willis they even try a corny in-joke involving her name.

I think it would be funnier if the girl had said, ""Ellie, what I like about you is, someone could shoe a horse on your chin.""

I always wonder: why do these movie makers spend $50 million or more to remake a perfectly great classic that never needed to be touched again?

In this one, you have a group of attractive and mostly talented young actresses.  Yet, they're given a script and direction so atrocious that none come out of this mess with anything to admire.

For one thing, the very plot of this remake defies logic: a group of vicious  sorority witches decide to trick a guy they don't like into believing he murdered one of their members. They carry this scenario out with predictable results: the poor slob actually ends up butchering the pretend victim. They throw her corpse into a pit and then spend years pretending they don't know what happened.

Then they do stupid things. When it's clear that someone has discovered their secret and are killing them off slowly, the girls never arm themselves against danger. If they're trapped in a room and someone's battering down the door, the victim just stands there and screeches and looks around without trying to find some object to defend herself.

And then at the end, when the killer is revealed, you have to stare at this person to remember where you've seen him. Because he's only been shown for a nano second at the beginning and nothing in the movie connects him to being a psycho.

I can't think of any old classic that hasn't been butchered and ""re-imagined"" these days. ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" is coming out in a few weeks. Lionsgate is determined to give us yet ANOTHER Halloween remake after Rob Zombie butchered the franchise with his two atrocities: Halloween and its sequel H2 Halloween.

What I found were film highlights that surprised me in a good way and some lows that were irritating and maddening.

The surprise?  Usually what is bad in a slasher flick?  The acting of course!  Actually, I was taken aback at the director, the script, and the lead actresses to blend a menagerie of  personalities into a believable group of stalked and terrorized sorority sisters.

*Spoilers if you don't want to read on*

Leah Pipes, who plays the witchy Jessica, made my jaw drop a couple of times during the movie with her dialogue and the dead-pan serious way in which she conveyed it.  She has great fun with the self-obsessive, downright cruel sorority ""leader"".  Margo Harshman, who plays Chugs, the beyond sexually promiscuous one, comes across with such a matter-of-fact I'm a tramp and I know it--whatever.  The scene where she toasts herself in the mirror and ridicules herself with a self-admitting this is what I am statement is both saddening but amusing.  Rumer Willis, who plays Ellie, covers the emotionally distraught one more than sufficiently.  My only fault with Rumer and it isn't so much her fault, perhaps the director, is that she goes through the entire movie near hysterics and at the end in the blink of an eye does an about face into ""I'm a brave person now"" seriousness.  It seemed very hollow, there should have been more of a cue in metamorphosis where the viewer could see the character of Ellie moving toward the change.

The other actresses did well too and the cameo performance by Carrie Fisher as the tough as nails house mother makes me want to purchase this movie.

  I also give credit for creativity-I never saw a tire iron made up like that into a weapon, yikes.  The beginning prank resulting in death was a bit stretched too long, but I'll give it an A for originality. The resuscitation scene was a little gross though, have to admit.

  The lows:

1)  WHY is it in most slasher movies that when there is a group of people trying to escape from a slasher, they DON'T run, no, they all go back into the house where the killer is and THEN they split up. Well, maybe if they do that, there's no story or movie. :))  Still, there has to be a different way.

2)  A very aggravating scene was where the biological sister of the sorority sister killed in the prank is wandering through the downstairs calling for her sister who may still be alive, but her calls were not emotional, desperate, or really full of anything.  She might as well have been calling out ""I think it's going to rain today"" or ""I have some letters to put in the mailbox after class"".
Aaarrrrgh!

3)  The ending, or so-called sequel hint of an ending. Enough said.

4)  I guess I'm more of a suspense fan. Like the ""Scream"" series, I like action-slasher films.  There's no chase scenes, only ""oh now where are you killer"" moments and then he's there and it's done. And it's too reminiscent of the ""Black Christmas"" movie for those of you who have seen it who can recall the house fire at the end of that movie.  Just because it's a sorority house doesn't mean it HAS to catch on fire!  In closing, the confrontation scenes really were just the heroine hitting the killer over the head and walking away, the heroine hitting the killer over the head AGAIN and walking away.  I just wish I had director skills for I believes an audience deserve something to ""chew on"", hold them in the moment, create suspense not just clobber-pause, clobber-pause, etc.

 All in all, I'm very surprised to be wanting to get this movie for the acting and not the script content.  To the actresses-way to go ladies!!

3858656,5,B00275EHDM,This was to me a very good slasher flick like the scream. i know what you did last summer and the urban legend movies which i enjoyed. If you enjoyed those movies i highly recommend this movie. Can't wait for the DVD release.,1264982400,4,225,4.255813953488372
3858657,4,B00275EHDM,"What you see is what you get. This is a GREAT slasher, and CORRECTLY serves as a throwback to the 80s and 90s slashers we all loved so much. The kills are really creative and cool, the dialogue is funny and delightfuly cheesy. Means Girls + I Know What You Did Last Summer = Sorority Row...SLASHER GOLD!!",1261440000,19,304,4.350877192982456

8354040,5,B00275EHDM,"Six girls that are introduced as Chugs (Margo Harshmann), Jessica (Leah
Pipes), Claire (Jamie Chung), Ellie (Rumer Willis), Cassidy (Briana
Evigan from burning bright) who are celebrating the beginning of their
senior year. They clandestinely watch Chug's brother Garret (Matt
O'Leary) and Megan (Audrina Partridge) by laptop camera, and Garrett
leaves in a panic as Megan throws up as a joke, the group joins Megan
as they had a good laugh off and continue with the prank as Garret
returns with a car to get to the nearest hospital. They have no phone
signal and they are led to an abandoned water well site which is remote
from any suburban area. Garrett fatally stabs Megan with a tire iron.
In a panic and composure with true inner tendencies coming out like
never before, they choose to keep ""secrecy and solidarity"" on the
cover up by dumping Megan's body with Cassidy's coat, and on time to
come back to the party.

Eight months later on their graduation thanking Mrs Crenshaw (the
fabulous Carrie Fisher who adds comedy flair and balls), as they hang
out, a text attachment of the bloody weapon that killed Megan appears
on their mobile cell phone, they delete to forget it - and throw
another wild party for the evening, then Megan's Sister Maggie
(Caroline D'Amore) shows up which freaks the group out so they sent her
away gently.

As the group break up the gruesome and cringing murders happen one by
one, as the group are getting mind screwed with impossible
possibilities such as: is Megan back from the dead? Or has really
Garrett gone nuts? They are at a break down and breaking point with
betrayal or making bonds as the story unfolds and the culprit reveals
their identity.

The script is fantastic because it is so unapologetic and bombastic,
this is a crazy and youthful movie that has the darkest humour I ever
seen. Majority of the cast is good looking and have their own sense of
comedy wit. Leah Pipes steals the show as the detestable, icy, catty,
loquacious Jessica who is my favourite character and didn't want her to
die. Ellie the plain Jane out of the girls survives and is the most annoying character (identical to the same looking girl from Rob Zombie's Halloween).

Despite the turnout, this is one of my favourite horror movies that is
crazy, narcissistic, ratty but witty and very funny. The death scenes
are well created. What more could you ask for with a great music score
and memorable soundtrack?",1494547200,,2436,4.738207547169812

8354042,5,B00275EHDM,This is movie is fun to watch when their is nothing good on television. I wanted to watch this movie in theaters but I wasn`t old enough to watch back then. This movie brings back liked any other horror films back in the day that has to deal with a killer in a party. When I order the movie I got a different cover it`s not as the same as the picture but I watched the movie it`s in english.

8354047,4,B00275EHDM,"This supposed remake of The House on Sorority Row has a bad practical joke go horribly awry.  Naturally, they cant have a pesky body lying around.  But how convenient, heres a mine shaft, dump her.  Of course not everyone is bereft of conscience, Cassidy (Briana Evigan) tries to stand up for whats right only to have her sorority sisters turn on her, threatening blackmail.  Whoops, your jacket is on the body.  (And yet the ringleader has no problem with also dumping the murder weapon down the same shaft.  With her fingerprints and the killers on it!)  Theyre not the brightest mob on campus.

Of course they all start dying at the hands of a robed killer sporting a snazzy new tire iron rigged with weapons suitable for slicing and dicing.  All the elements one would expect in a slasher flick are present and accounted for.  The big REVEAL is a bit of a lead weight.  The attempts at humor are a bit lame.  Still, it was entertaining.",1478736000,,940,4.562874251497006
