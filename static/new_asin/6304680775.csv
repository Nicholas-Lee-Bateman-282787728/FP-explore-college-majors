909974,4,6304680775,"This is a good, if somewhat dated, film and shows Robert Young as someone other than Jim Anderson (""Father Knows Best"") or Marcus Welby. It's on a par with his other movies from the late 1940s-early 1950s. The transfer of the film to DVD is adequate, at best, but at least the film is available and watchable. I recommend this DVD to film noir and Robert Young fans.",1271894400,3,366,4.397058823529412
909975,5,6304680775,"This atmospheric mystery has almost a gothic feel, the stark black and white photography of Hal Mohr meshing nicely with Tschaikousky's music to create a sustained mood throughout. Produced by Mort Briskin in conjunction with Robert Smith, who also wrote the story, it gradually pulls the viewer in deeper and deeper until completely immersed in the happenings.

A mysterious mood is set from the very beginning with shots of a house called Hilltop overlooking the California coastline. Betsy Drake's voiceover reveals in flashback the reason a simple knock on her door instills fear. Robert Young is the architect named Jeff who meets and charms Betsy Drake's Ellen Foster on a train bound for Pine Cliff. It is where he built Hilltop for a bride we discover died in a tragic car accident the day before their marriage. He has not been the same since, Dr. Hartley (Morris Carnovsky) stating his concern for his intermittent bouts of depression.

Ellen is a sweet girl who falls for Jeff during his more charming moments and is sympathetic to his darker moods. Ben Shepard (Henry O'Neill) is the would-have-been father-in-law he has remained close to, and Keith (John Sutton) is the slimy playboy lusting after Jeff's newfound love. An atmosphere of impending doom hangs over the couple's romance, and as misfortune begins to pile up on Jeff, Ellen suspects he is being given the gaslight treatment. Since he is obviously keeping a secret, it is unclear what is really going on, keeping the viewer guessing.

Drake is very likable as the CPA standing by Jeff even as he pushes her away. She knows a fading painting, a dying bush, and a wounded horse are a statistical improbability, Jeff's rotten luck a little too bad to be true. But when helping him puts her in danger, he hatches a dangerous plan to get at the truth. There is an earthy realism to their romance, a maturity that seems fresh for this time period. What it lacks in excitement it makes up for in psychological drama and atmosphere. Director James V. Kern's film may be less heralded than others made earlier in the cycle, but makes a nice one for a Saturday morning or late at night. Robert Young and Betsy Drake make a nice couple in a forgotten little gem which deserves a second look.",1270166400,3,2254,4.774358974358974
909976,4,6304680775,"Forgotten noir with Robert Young and Betsy Drake...lots of atmosphere and, for its time, a good amount of guessing before you know who done it. Young's cliff side house is an amazing set piece.",1246665600,2,193,4.705882352941177
909977,5,6304680775,"This atmospheric mystery plays out like a gothic drama, the stark black and white photography of Hal Mohr and Tschaikousky's music creating a sustained mood until its satisfying conclusion. Produced by Mort Briskin and Robert Smith, who also wrote the story, it gradually pulls the viewer in deeper and deeper until we are completely immersed in the happenings.

A mysterious mood is set from the very beginning with shots of the California coast and a house built on a cliff overlooking the sea called Hilltop. Betsy Drake's voice relates her fear regarding a knock on the door, then flashes back to the events leading up to it. Robert Young is an architect named Jeff who meets and charms Betsy Drake's Ellen Foster on a train bound for Pine Cliff. It is where he built Hilltop for a bride we discover died in a tragic car accident the day before their marriage. He has not been the same since, Dr. Hartley (Morris Carnovsky) stating his concern for his intermittent bouts of depression.

Ellen is a sweet girl who falls for Jeff during his charming moments, sympathetic to his darker moods. He remains close to his former fiancee's father, Ben Shepard (Henry O'Neill). Keith (John Sutton) is the slimy playboy hoping to get control of old man Shepard's money while at the same time lusting after Jeff's newfound love. There is a moody atmosphere of some impending doom hanging over their romance, and as one instance of bad luck after another begins to pile up on Jeff, Ellen begins to suspect he is being given the gaslight treatment. Dr. Hartley believes however, that Jeff is displaying classic symptoms of paranoia brought on by guilt at his fiancee's death. Since it is obvious Jeff has some secret he is keeping, what is really happening remains unclear.

Drake is very likable as the CPA standing by Jeff even as he pushes her away. She knows a fading painting, a dying bush, and a wounded horse are a statistical improbability; as she tells Jeff, ""Your bad luck, Jeff, it's a little too bad to be true."" But when helping him puts her in danger also, perhaps even from himself, he hatches a dangerous plan to draw out the truth about what really has been going on. There is a sort of realism to their romance, a maturity that seems fresh for this time period.

What it lacks in excitement it makes up for in an involving psychological drama which glues the viewer to the screen. Director James V. Kern's film may be less heralded than others made earlier in the cycle, but makes a nice one for a Saturday morning or late at night.

909978,5,6304680775,"I had never heard of this movie, but it was a very pleasent surprise.  It was suspenseful and a good watch.  Well worth the purchase.",1214784000,5,133,4.28
909979,2,6304680775,"Robert Young plays Jeff Cohalan, an architect who may or may not have caused the death of his bride-to-be several months ago. Now, as he becomes involved with a young woman staying nearby, strange ""accidents"" begin to plague his life ... is Jeff subconsciously ""punishing"" himself over his feelings of guilt, or is something more sinister going on?

Unfortunately, the outcome of the mystery is rather routine, the romance aspect of the plot is rather unconvincing, and though the film isn't exactly dull, it's not half the fun it could have been.

Alpha's DVD is about average for them (which is to say pretty poor by anyone else's standards). The picture is watchable, not too dark, but there are numerous instances of print damage and vertical lines appear on the right side of the picture for long periods of the film. Sound quality is again poor, but bearable. It's low and rather muffled throughout the film, and once or twice the dialogue drops out completely for a second, but after a while you get used to it. For the cheap price I paid, I didn't mind the sub-standard DVD quality too much - the movie is still watchable.",1126396800,15,1130,4.702020202020202

910138,5,6304680775,"I have always liked Robert Young and he did not disappointment me with his acting in this movie. He could light up a room one minute and the next minute he was brooding. I did get frustrated with him a few times during the movie because he seemed so passive at times when I felt he should have became aggressive. It was a ""stick and stones"" attitude. But all of this was for a reason as you will see by the end of the movie.

Like Ellen, I felt that someone was setting him up--and I thought I knew who it was--a snake in the grass. Then later I thought it was someone else who seemed to take too much interest in Jeff. Every time you turned around something bad happened to Jeff--some of it pretty horrible. The suspense kept building as each new thing happened--and you wondered how Ellen could still have faith in Jeff and believe in him. I guess real love does that to you. Some would call it denial.

I won't tell the story as I am sure others have already done so here, I will just tell you that I really liked this dark mystery and was really surprised at the end. Once I knew who was really doing all of these bad things to Jeff, I immediately knew why--and you will too. But you are going to have to watch the movie to come to the same conclusion because I won't give the end away.

I know that this was an old black and white movie, but I still enjoyed it. If you like suspenseful movies and ""who done it"" movies, then this movie is for you.  There was no sex scenes or profanity in the movie--which I really appreciated.",1452384000,,1531,4.162162162162162

910146,4,6304680775,"...funny, not comic laugh funny, not joke on the street funny, but maybe just plain old ordinary human nature funny, the strangest kind, how lust for revenge, hell, let's call it by its right name, bloodlust for revenge, will twist a man or woman up inside so much they, well, they will not hesitate at the crime of crimes, murder. Take Ben Sheppard , successful California real estate developer, whose family had been in California since practically before those stinking bracero conquistador  Aztec days and he had the land grants to prove it. He had been successful beyond his wildest dreams as he hit the post-war (post- World War II to not confuse anyone on which war) California real estate god gold rush before most people could even identify that august state on a map (and given three chanced to boot).

Yes, he was selling dream, California-blessed fading orange sun-sized dream of cozy little sea-side inlet bungalows and other prime new world a-borning valley housing tracts to those eager G.I.s back from the Pacific war and then welded to the California coast that they had noticed when they embarked on those leaky troop transports headed on to ancient island battlefields. To those who had prospered, war prospered, in the great okie/arkie dust bowl migration and eager to shake the dust off, the sod off, and the from hunger off with some little California modern to replace the trailer park digs. And Ben could look forward to selling, once they settled down from the boom-boom pacific coast highway chicken runs and the late night abandoned sex in their hot rods, those very sons and daughters of that eastern migration.(Ben, realistic to the core when it came to real estate, if not in other matters,  knew that he would never capture the serious white trash market, the guys and their mamas who were burning up the highways and scaring the bejesus out of honest citizens on their boom-boom-boom Harleys and Indians. He would leave that market to the stinking braceros. )  So Ben Sheppard, well respected, well- connected Ben Sheppard was on easy street.

Oh sure he had had some problems like we all do. A wife, a wife who came from good old Spanish land grant family, and knew senor this and senora that, going back to Cortez and Balboa, who had run off one night with his garbacho stinking  building site foreman, some low mex batos loco as it turned out when he tried to trace  them later. Run off in one of his brand new Hudson coupes, she waving some silky mex-colored  scarf  trailing in the wind as she, half- drunk as usual, kissed him off as he watched them in the driveway of his hacienda, yelling ""Adios, gusano, adios,"" leaving him with his young daughter. His private detectives never did find her (or him) although he had them search the whole west coast and right down into fellaheen Mexico.

Of course, as one would expect as that daughter, Vivian,  came of age, he had his problems with her, her and the boys, those hot rod boys who were thrilling all the young coast girls with their dare-devil antics, their golden boy good-looks and their ,ah, bedroom eyes. One incident at a LaJolla road house had cost him plenty to hush up, hush up about her age (under age for drinking) , hush up about what she was caught doing in some tar paper back lot joy shack and with whom, and hush up those guys involved too. She certainly had some of her mother' s spitfire whorish ways in her, for a while anyway, until he sent her away to school in the east. And until Jeff (played by Robert Young), his main dream house and dream California architect, caught her fancy when she came back from the east cured of her wildness. And so things stood until the war came, and Jeff was off to the Pacific.

After Jeff got back from the Pacific wars they were to be married. Ben, who had treated  Jeff like a son and had pushed hard for his projects before the banks and other interested parties, was the happiest he had been had been since that whorish wife left him. Then the very night before the wedding, Jeff, Jeff drunk as a skunk had taken one of Ben's Hudson coupes, and taken his Vivian for a coast ride, a fatal, fatal to Vivian, high speed coast ride. Jeff had murdered, there was no other word for it in his mind, none, his only daughter. The cops said accident, everybody else just said it was tragic and moved on. Even Jeff was eaten up by what he done, eaten up to the core and consumed himself in work. But when a man murders, and the more Ben thought about it the more that word really was the only word for it, a man, a father if he was really a father must avenge that death, and avenge it anyway he could. And that is when he began to hatch his nefarious plots.

Meanwhile Jeff, starting to have the fog lift a little from his traumatic involvement in Vivian's dead, began to have a very odd string of bad luck. A favored horse came up lame and had to be put away. A favorite dog died under mysterious circumstances, a favored rose bush too. Things, very strange things kept happening and as they did those around him began to sense that Jeff's wheels were coming off. When his house (a very Frank Lloyd Wright-ish house) nettled atop an inlet rock cove burned to the ground he almost went over the edge. And those around him looked twice when he approached them.

But see not all Jeff's luck was bad, not by any means, because during this time a niece house guest of a neighbor, Ellen (played  by Betty Drake), came  his way, they fell for each other big, and she, a trained  CPA (Certified Public Accountant, no other meaning for those in steeped in cyberspace lingo) while not cooing with Jeff, stood by her man, big time as well, and helped to find out why Jeff was having some very bad days against all the laws of probability, luck- wise that is. Needless to say no CPA (remember what that means) would fall for a murderer so she/he/they began to unravel the details that led up to those pieces of bad luck. Guess who they zeroed in on. Yes, Ben. And guess what Ben found out to his misfortunate. Well I will leave that to your viewing. But here is a hint. Vivian had a little more of her mother's laughing brown eyes whore still left in her that old Ben realized. Still that revenge thing, that bloodlust revenge thing, well it was pretty strong. And has been part of the human condition for a while.",1357344000,,6342,4.485689505637468
