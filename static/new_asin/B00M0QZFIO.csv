8669506,5,B00M0QZFIO,"All of the Intimacy Anorexia & Married and Alone resources are very good for treating this aspect of sex addiction (SA). As is written by multiple authors, sex addiction is an intimacy disorder, and this along with the pervasive lying-deceitfulness mindset and lifestyle that also accompanies SA, the sex addict develops moderately to severe Intimacy Anorexia (the severity of his IA depending on multiple other factors).

But Weiss is overall very uneducated (and this is quite surprising given the nature of his work and all the tons of info available) in regards to the whole devastating experience that a sexually betrayed, multi-faceted traumatized, love-starved, wife endures. In his dvd Helping Her Heal and here and there throughout his other resources, he shows good understanding and compassion for betrayed wives, but then he equally shows so much LACK of understanding and compassion throughout much of his resources as well, and which then so further harms and hurts wives.

He just does NOT understand that it takes anywhere from 2-5 YEARS (and even beyond depending on her specific marriage and childhood experiences) to heal from all the multi-faceted trauma and grief  avalanche of losses is one way authors Dr. Jennifer Schneider and Dr. Deborah Corley describe this part of the wives experience; these authors plus Wendy Conquest wrote of the length of healing time for wives (by the way, I highly recommend all of their excellent info books!).

Weiss expects wives to bounce back FAR too quickly and if they dont, he severely shames them (by invalidating the degree, depth, and extent of their grief, pain, and trauma, and by having unrealistic demands of them) by slapping on the label that they are IA or what he refers to as Reactive IA. He included in his books and dvd that 39% of wives are IA, which is completely erroneous because he comes to this conclusion based on the fact of his refusal to become sufficiently educated on the extent of her multi-faceted trauma and depth of her grief which is inflicted on the wife by her unfaithful husband. Complex Betrayal Trauma, which includes Sexual Trauma (from both withIN and without the marital relationship), Emotional & Psychological Trauma, and also Reality Fragmentation Trauma (some authors use the terms Relational or Attachment Traumas). And all of these in ADDITION to her overwhelming grief and losses.

Weiss is very largely completely unrealistic in his expectations of the betrayed wife, while very frequently suggesting all sorts of things for HER to do IN ORDER TO keep the recovering sex addict as COMFORTABLE as possible and doing so
at HER EXPENSE (which then also diminishes HIS recovery because PAIN is what drives him to strongly pursue recoveringas has been said in the recovery world, one does not change until the pain of NOT changing is GREATER THAN the pain of changing). For example, he expects her to regularly speak praises to the husband who has slaughtered her heart and life. He also  as is typical of all sex addicts  expects her to forgive way too soon -> authors like Stefanie Carnes, Milton Magness, and Vicki Tidwell Palmer strongly caution against quick-forgiveness, which is very unhealthy for the wife and also detrimental to the addicts recover. Another example is that he strongly pushes her to be sexual with her adulterer husband very early on/FAR TOO SOON in each of their recovery process for what is best for HER, in order to protect the sex addict from experiencing the natural unpleasant consequences of his wrongfulness against her. This level of cruelty toward wives by Weiss is completely incomprehensible.

In addition, until the sex addict has done a THOROUGH Step 4 in the 12-Steps program (followed by a polygraph because no sex addict will confess ALL without knowing that it will be objectively verified) of his moral failures, including his sexual ones, he brings that repulsive crap to  and literally INTO  his wife during their shared sexual experience together, which her body-heart-spirit experience as repulsive, defiling, and traumatizing. One aspect of the psychological phenomena of projecting/transference/adult-to-adult induced. Also, until he does about 18 months of very diligent recovery work (including completing a thorough written 12 Steps program in a recovery group), then followed by studying and learning about what MATURE marital sexual intimacy truly/actually is, he will just continue being sexual with her in the only way he knows how -> draining and depleting her, and very mainly only going after what brings HIM the greatest sexual intensity pleasure and not giving much care at all to what makes the experience a very positive one for HER, and this all works to further traumatize her sexually, emotionally, and psychologically, while also taking away from her already-depleted energy of focusing on her healing. The addict also is in need of learning that the only HEALTHY purpose of being sexual is to EXPRESS LOVE to his wife. It is NOT for the purpose of merely seeking his own intensity sexual pleasure, NOR that of filling his emotional or spiritual needs/voids (including that of helping him to cope with life, to manage his stress, anger, and sadness in his life)  he needs to work diligently on his own to meet those needs and in maturing in his emotional life and spiritual life, and not look to draining and using his wife sexually in order to medicate these areas.

Unlike all or nearly all other recovery authors, Weiss only lists HIS resources at the back of his books for the reader to seek out more info, while other authors list multiple OTHER authors resources. Weiss would do well to be much more connected to and learning from many other professionals in the recovery world  this would greatly help him in correcting his multiple harmful approaches toward betrayed, traumatized wives.",1522713600,,5865,5.065284974093264
