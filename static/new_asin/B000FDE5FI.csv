2561249,5,B000FDE5FI,"Kathleen Madigan gives an outstanding performance in the DVD presentation. It's a solid evening of entertainment. She includes some of her older material (which is classic) but most of the DVD is new. Any fan would be pleased and if you have never seen Kathleen perform, a real treat awaits you.",1168300800,5,295,4.803921568627451
2561250,5,B000FDE5FI,"I've watched it twice now and enjoyed her performance both times. First heard of her on Sirius satellite radio and enjoyed the bits so much, I had to have the DVD. Recommended!",1167177600,,176,4.53125
2561251,5,B000FDE5FI,"I caught a quick clip of Kathleen Madigan in this performance on Comedy Central one day and laughed so hard, I went searching online for any available DVD of the performance. This DVD was even better than I expected. Six of us watched it together one night after dinner and we were in tears with laughter, clutching our sides which hurt from laughing so hard. Kathleen delivers a great performance with exceptional comedic timing, the right amount of irreverance, great political thoughts, and a fun look at some everyday occurrences we can all relate to. This was one of the best comedy DVDs I've ever purchased.",1164326400,23,613,4.7924528301886795
2561252,4,B000FDE5FI,I was interested in this Kathleen Madigan DVD since she is from this area originally.  Very funny take on a lot of current events.,1156464000,2,130,4.416666666666667
2561253,5,B000FDE5FI,"We thoroughly enjoyed Kathleen Madigan, and would like to see more DVDs with later performances.",1267833600,,96,5.466666666666667
2561254,3,B000FDE5FI,"The Kathy Madigan received on this live stand up show does not have the momentum and energy as we have experienced in the past. Several of the jokes are re-told, perhaps more politically correct, but certainly bumbling. I was amused at her family story telling of liberal parents, then flopping into their ""ignorant"" right-wing stereotypes. Again, Madigan's own disdain of relationship guru Laura Schlessinger and her opinions of others, are matched with Kathy's own slant. With that, her stereotypes against southern people have gone from the previous pointed cute idiosyncratics, to down-right hateful assasination of Southern character. Listening to the marginal response of the Denver audience, you may understand their own confusion as-to-whats-up-her...? No, I'm an Arizonan, folks....

In all fairness, it has its moments, the earlier audio DVD is much more entertaining. I really looked forward to  seeing Kathleen live, but now I'll pass. If your from the ""Deep North"", within all of it's glorious elitism, then you'll enjoy the portions.",1255996800,3,1047,5.45679012345679
2561255,5,B000FDE5FI,"Yes, rolling on the floor laughing! I don't go to comedy clubs, and I never before owed a DVD of a comedian, but when I heard Kathleen Madigan on Sirius radio I knew I had to hear more. This DVD does not disappoint! The first 5 minutes start to warm you up, and by 15 minutes in you are hurting from laughter.",1235865600,,309,4.0

2561257,5,B000FDE5FI,I really needed a laugh when I bought this.  Kathleen has a priceless sense of timing and delivery.  I will keep buying the material she produces.  One thing I like is she changes her material on subsequent issues.  One of our best female comedy stars.,1204329600,,252,4.533333333333333
2561258,5,B000FDE5FI,"After seeing Kathleen Madigan on Comedy Central I looked online for a DVD featuring her.  I bought this DVD and enjoyed it very much.  Clean humor, great delivery, and terrific timing.  I can't wait until she produces another DVD.  Highly recommended.",1191888000,,251,5.048780487804878
2561259,5,B000FDE5FI,"To Onstar: ""Lady, I repeat, I'm trapped in the car with my parents"". This album is hysterical and infinately quotable.  She's intelligent, sarcastic, smart, VERY funny, and will make you tear with laughter. We've listened to it many times and although we know what's coming, it's still hysterical. If you like Ron White you would probably like her. Good political humor, social commentary, with a clean presentation, yet hysterically edgy.  She is extrememly sarcastic, with great metaphors about George Bush. I can't wait for her next ablum. ""in other words......"" She's simply a great giggle over and over again. I HIGHLY recommend her. There are so many good routines, I can't pick one.",1187654400,11,689,5.088495575221239

8120877,5,B000FDE5FI,"if you're having a blue day, this is a good antidote.  kathleen madigan's take on life will have you laughing so much you might have to hit ""pause"" so you don't miss any dialogue.",1476662400,,179,4.264705882352941
8120878,4,B000FDE5FI,"Kathleen has a very entertaining delivery. I believe this was one of her earlier CDS.  Her growth as an entertainer, the topics covered  in her later offerings captured our faithful following...waiting for her latest CD.  Pat Engebrecht",1470182400,,236,5.324324324324325
8120879,4,B000FDE5FI,"Kathleen Madigan I think is a very under-rated comedienne. She has an amazingly funny take on many real life situations. And her descriptions of her family interactions are truly hilarious. While my favorite of her performances is still ""Kathleen Madigan Again"" this one is excellent as well.",1466726400,,292,5.23404255319149

8120885,5,B000FDE5FI,"She tickles my funny bone.  This DVD is an earlier work up of her 2 later ones - but being a big fan I got it from Amazon - used at a ridiculously high price.
If you want this DVD new - go to her official website - get it there for  $20.00.  Much less than I paid for a used one - laughing and kicking myself.  Am finding more and more I can get better choice and costs  going directly to artists' sites.  Always take a second third look at  Amazon prices these days is my experience and advice.",1396483200,,495,3.89
