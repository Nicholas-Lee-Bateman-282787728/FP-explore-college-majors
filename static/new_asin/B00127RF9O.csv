8244556,3,B00127RF9O,"I liked this movie. It was entertaining but it is a PG movie so if your looking for the nudity found in a modern biker flick like Hell Ride you won't find any here. The acting was decent especially for one of Jack Nicholson's early movies. The beginning was great due to the appearance of the real Hells Angels led by a young Sonny Barger. There are some nice old bikes pictured and some good riding scenes. This is what I like seeing in a biker movie as opposed to some other people. However, the ending was abrupt and somewhat comical. It's not bad but I wouldn't spend too much money buying a copy. Some of the prices I have seen online are ridiculous. Hells Angels '69 is a better movie in my opinion but if you like collecting biker and Jack Nicholson movies you would probably want to have this movie for your collection.
  Wild Ride was a very primitive production. However, I didn't dislike this movie because Jack Nicholson was a bigger villian than he is at Celtic-Laker games. He does a good jod portraying a hot rodding juvenile delinquent who doesn't care about anyone but himself. It's too bad the film couldn't have been preserved better because it's pure Jack and I found it interesting. If the director had a bigger budget and better production this movie could have been better, in my opinion, than Rebel Without A Cause. Nicholson was great even then.",1294531200,,1370,4.5425101214574894
