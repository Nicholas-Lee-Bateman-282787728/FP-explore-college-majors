8318926,5,B001LNOM2M,"By this point everyone probably has every Roy Rogers film ever made or enough movies on hand to watch and enjoy. Die-hards are presently seeking the complete (non-TV 54 minute prints) of a few films that have yet to be found uncut and unedited. Gasp! Yes, many Roy Rogers films on DVD being sold are edited. Any film under 60 minutes is edited. During the 1960s, many of his films were cut down in length for TV airings and sadly, that's what exists. But you can find full-length uncut prints if you take a moment and make sure they are longer than 60 minutes. Average length was about 72. Anyway, this is one of those rare films people overlook because Roy Rogers is in the cast (before he became famous as Roy Rogers, ""King of the Cowboys""). Don't expect him to play the lead role. But watch out for a pre-starring role from the man himself.",1370217600,2,843,4.410256410256411
