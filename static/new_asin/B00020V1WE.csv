Judge sentences him to a community work for his ""masterpieces""-and both of them are going to escape desperately boring reality either experiences by own way.

8019718,5,B00020V1WE,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable film.  For those of you who don't speak Danish it may take more than one viewing as one tends to lose some of the action while reading subtitles.

The Dark Horse is a refreshing alternative to the overproduced sappy american love stories where everyone is the hero with nary a hair out of place.  Dark Horse is in black and white and all of the characters are flawed and that is precisely why we love them.  Nicolas Bro gives a stellar performance as Morfar, Daniel'sby the book best friend who aspires to become a soccer ref.

In addition to directing Kari also composed and performed the soundtrack with his fellow band member Orri Jonnson.  Keep an eye out for Kari's latest film ""The Good Heart"" starring Brian Cox and Paul Dano.",1212883200,2,765,4.588235294117647
8019719,4,B00020V1WE,"It's a true story about a young Canadian equestrian and a difficult misunderstood horse, who make the Canadian Olympic Dressage Team.
While it is the typical girl loses her horse, girl needs a horse, misunderstood talented horse needs understanding trainer and rider, they all get together and win a really big event type of story...horse lovers will still enjoy this film.
Also there are not many horse films about Dressage riders and their horses and this one, while it could have been better and the camera work could have, at times, shown more of the horse in action than reaction shots of the rider's face, it is still a wonderfully entertaining movie and well worth the price it sells for and you won't regret the time spent watching it!
It is suitable for all ages and horse lovers will enjoy this story!",1084492800,6,811,4.71830985915493
