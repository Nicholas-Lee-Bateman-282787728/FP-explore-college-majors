8319187,2,B001LNOMUY,"""Dangerous Charter"" is a fairly standard early 1960's heist movie set on a very old yacht, the ""Medusa."" The print is in terrible condition with numerous distracting scratches and flaws present and a very abrupt opening title card. The premise is simple, if daft. Three fishermen, led by the dapper Marty (Chris Warfield,) find an abandoned yacht with a dead body onboard. They take it to port and find the man has died suddenly and without warning from mumps (!) and since the boat's owner cannot be found, they are given the boat as their reward. It turns out the previous owner of the boat, the urbane Mr. Monet (Peter Forster,) wants the boat back. No wait. He doesn't. There's a charter to Bolivia. No, wait, a hijacking Mexican lobsterman helps redirect them to Catalina Island (which is clearly visible in the background of much of the film.) Monet is mean. Then he's nice. Then he's mean again. People do illogical things and utterly fail to help their situation. Mayhem ensues. It's not actually the boat Monet wants, it's the $500,000 (1962 dollars, remember) worth of heroin hidden on it. The stirring conclusion involves a hail of gunfire, a speedboat, a spear gun, a bomb, and a very unlikely betrayal.

In other words, it's all very formulaic, right down to the multiple awful guitar-backed ballads Marty belts out to love interest June (Sally Fraser) and the campy, often ridiculous banter that passes for dialogue. This is an undistinguished almost forgotten film, and has nothing to particularly recommend it. Having said that, it is also inoffensive and there are many, many worse movies to spend your time watching.",1321920000,,1634,4.898916967509026
8319188,2,B001LNOMUY,"DISCLAIMER:  I watched this film as included in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savage-Cinema-12-Movie-Collection/dp/B00310PSUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savage Cinema: 12 Movie Collection</a>, and as such, I cannot comment on the transfer quality of this manufactured on demand DVD-R.  Instead, I can only offer my overall impressions of the film as entertainment.

It is probably a testament to the slew of bad films that I've watched recently that I would even consider giving this film a third star, but it's honest, and no one's tried to make more of it than what it is.  Three fisherman, who've had a string of difficult times, stumble onto an abandoned yacht - worth 200,000 in 1962 dollars - with a corpse on board, and haul it in for salvage.  Unable to solve the mystery of the abandoned boat, or the dead man aboard, the Coast Guard and the FBI eventually release the boat to the fishermen (and the very attractive Sally Fraser, scream queen of late 50's horror flicks, who plays the daughter of one and fiance to another), in order that the down-at-their-heels men can start a luxury charter business.

But the FBI and the Coast Guard haven't given up altogether - they expect, and warn Capt Marty McBain, of possible trouble ahead.  Whoever abandoned that yacht may have a vested interest in getting it back, and the charter business might be a great way to smoke out whoever is in hiding.  In other words, to use the fisherman as bait.  (Ha!  This is about as sophisticated as the humor gets)

While this film is mostly predictable, the actors aren't overmatched by their roles, which at least lets the storyline glide along smoothly when the new charter business is hired to go down to La Paz, and is promptly hijacked on the high seas.  There is also quite a bit of corny dialogue fairly typical for an early sixties film, but it isn't too painful.  Although it lacks production value and star power, I don't see a lot of difference between the entertainment value of this film and dozens, or hundreds, of low grade adventure films.  The closest thing that this reminds me of are mediocre westerns from the same time period, and those who can appreciate those films as they are will probably not see much difference in 'Dangerous Charter'.  Yet those aficionados who are always on the lookout for bizarre movies and unrecognized cult classics may be disappointed here - 'Dangerous Charter' is too straightforward to supply much of the unintentional entertainment found in those other films.

I would be surprised if the print quality of this recording will be much better than the one from the collection I watched, produced by Mill Creek Entertainment.  That print was in bad shape, with the beginning credits chopped off and a title placard inserted instead.  Still, when cost-averaged out, the Mill Creek edition comes to about fifty pennies, and might be a better value.  Overall, 'Dangerous Charter' certainly isn't a must have (unless you are a Sally Fraser completist, and their could definitely be worse things), but not a complete waste either.

Note: my title isn't a misspelling, but rather an in-joke from the movie.",1285459200,,3188,5.036190476190476
