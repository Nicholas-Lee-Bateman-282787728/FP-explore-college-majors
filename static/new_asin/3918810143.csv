204845,1,3918810143,"I absolutely love the first Protector so I was looking forward to seeing this. But it's so bad it's really not worth it. While #1 was raw, slickly choreographed fight after fight, this one was stupid-looking, cheesy, badly animated crashes and gun play and not even a lot of the acrobatic stuff Jaa is so good at. Add to that poor editing and camera angles - way too many close ups. Looked like a high school film project gone wrong. The story wasn't even grabbing me - same old stolen elephant theme.

Dont know whyy they higher rappers in movies rarely goes well. I guess they had a shortage of crappy talentless actors and rza was first pick for the part.

204851,1,3918810143,"it kept getting worse and worse as it went on.  halfway through, i thought ""this is maybe a 3-star movie, nowhere near as good as the first one"" but by the end i'm pretty sure it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen.  tony jaa looks good and his young female costar jija yanin is good as well, but everyone else in the movie is terrible.  i find it hard to believe that this movie was even directed by the same person as the original because they have nothing in common.  the fight scenes are poorly choreographed, awkwardly edited, and lack any sense of energy and power that marks so much of jaa's other work.  it just looks staged and poorly rehearsed, and several of the actors are obviously not professional martial artists, so their scenes are heavily edited to make it appear like they actually know what they're doing.  one of the biggest action set pieces in the movie was the rooftop motorcycle fight, and it comes off as really lame and stupid.  jaa barely fights in that one, he just runs around.  and the special effects are truly terrible at times.  many scenes are full of obvious greenscreen cgi and bad wire work.  every time the movie tries to kick it into high gear, the bad fight choreography and poor direction slow it down to a crawl.  it's almost embarrassing.  the plot is full of bizarre contrivances and pointless decisions by the other characters.  when jaa apparently falls of a skyscraper into a swimming pool (?) the cops look around but don't see his body so they just shrug their shoulders and walk away.  huh?  and in the big final fight scene, the villain seems to be trying to commit suicide by activating the bomb when he's standing right next to it.  seriously, that final fight scene makes no sense at all.  exactly what was the villain trying to accomplish?  the last 20 minutes of the movie are just awful in every way.  they should have saved the money they spent on all the bad cgi, and used it to hire better martial artists and create better fight choreography.",1444348800,,2009,4.5

204862,3,3918810143,"Talk about doing a complete 180 from it's predecessor. Where as the first film had a little bit of wire work & special effects (nothing wrong with that) this sequel completely over did it in those departments...big time. Half the time while watching this ""martial arts"" movie I didn't know what it was trying to be. Either a basic fight film or a typical been there seen that big budget action circus show. The premise that attracted me to this genre in the first place was always its simplicity to entertain with all the well timed choreographed fight scenes each film displayed. Once you start tossing in blue screening & wire work into the mix plus guns with big explosions then it stops becoming one of those movies, & turns into one of THOSE movies. Something I've seen time & time again from all the U.S. action stars of yesteryear & today. The only reason why I did give this 3 stars unbelievably enough was because of some of the fight scenes that actually stood out as being really well done. Which is the only reason to actually give this film a look.",1436659200,,1061,4.5025906735751295

204867,5,3918810143,"I really like the first film but I like this one too. I can however see why some people don't like this one.

1. the special effects. I did notice that a stunt double was used for some of tony's fight scenes. he did not do them all by himself.
2. it's the whole elephant getting kidnapped thing again.

but for me that still did not take away my enjoyment of this one. in the Protector 2 tony is framed for a murder he did not commit
while once trying to save his elephant this time from RZA and his army of bad guys. I thought RZA was a really great bad guy in this. the final battle between him and tony is a great one. I will not spoil it for you. I'll just let you watch and see for yourself. the extra features included are interviews, a making of, trailers and more. the thail language with optional english subtitles and english dub are the languages for you to select.
again not every one will indeed like this but if you can give it a try.",1426377600,,948,4.064171122994653
204868,3,3918810143,"As mindless entertainment, The Protector 2 (Tom Yum Goong 2) is barely acceptable. The effects are cheesy and the story is confusing, but the Thai film still manages to be entertaining with the OK action set pieces using wires and visual effects. But what we have here is Tony Jaa, the guy who gave us Ong-Bak, and considering that fact, his new film is pretty disappointing.

The originals hero Kham (Tony Jaa) is back in his village living with an elephant Khon, but once again the elephant is kidnapped by someone, and Kham chases those who are responsible, while being chased by the police as a wrongly accused murderer.

The story doesnt make much sense, but this film's real trouble lies in the action part, or I should say, the way they ruined the action stunts. Tony Jaa does what he does, but, aside from the bad editing, the film suffers from the cheap effects (the film is obviously shot with 3D in mind). The use of fake exposition or fake cars lessens the thrill of watching action stunts considerably.

Also, as martial arts fighters Marrese Crump and Rhatha Phongam (memorable in Only God Forgives) are very impressive, but choreography is pretty generic, and Jeeja Yanin of Chocolate is terrible underused. Tony Jaas latest film needs a more coherent narrative and authentic action stunts, instead of CGI.",1424390400,,1321,4.81057268722467
204869,2,3918810143,"i love tony jaa, he is a total bad-@## . but this movie wasnt. it was ok , and the fighting was ok but the storyline wasn't even ok and the special effects are more like special-ed effects. its to the point of being funny or just sad instead of cool or awsome looking. do yourself a favor and rent this one if u really want to see it. but don't waste your money (unless youd like to buy mine).",1421452800,,393,3.925
204870,2,3918810143,"The Protector is easily the best martial arts movie Ive ever seen, and one of the few action movies I can watch at any time and still have fun watching it. It was raw, had insane fight sequences, showcased just what Tony Jaa was capable of, and didn't rely on cheap computer special effects to get the point across that Tony is a human weapon. On top of that, it managed to have a plot that you could get into a little bit. When Tony screams for his elephants, you want him to get those elephants. You almost want the bad guys to lay off and hand them over, because its clear no ones going to stop this guy. When I saw that a sequel to The Protector was made, I was pretty excited. How do you even attempt to top such a giant action movie? Well, you dont. The Protector 2 is basically what you shouldnt do when making a sequel to one of the best action movies out there. It feels like a made for tv movie, has countless scenes that would barely pass for a Playstation 2 era game cutscene, and once again, RZA is crowbarred into another martial arts movie. I only managed to make it through the whole movie because I thought for sure thered be a payoff in the end, maybe something like what I call The Bone Cracker Quartet from the first movie. Nope.

Plot summary in short = dudes in suits take Khams elephant and he goes nuts.

Plot summary a little less short? Kham is thrown into a bizarre world of cheap CG and poorly directed fight scenes whereok, you meant seriously? Well, thats the thing- its a mess. You have Kham looking for his elephant, but the guy who took it is mysteriously killed by an assassin (who used his fists for some reason on this defenseless guy). The murdered suits two nieces with bad haircuts think Kham did it and hunt him down for revenge. Meanwhile, the cop from the first movie, Mark (aka Humlae from Ong-Bak) is hot on the case of a terrorist plot todo something big I guess. And theres an underground weapons dealer named LC who is working behind the scenes with military leaders who want to control two countries that have finally begun peace talks. This guy also happens to run a stupid numbered fighting circle, where everyone is ranked and has their number somewhere on their body, from cuts to brands to tattoos that are clearly freshly done with Sharpies. Will Kham find his elephant and save it from poor writing and even poorer fight choreography?

Man, it really hurt to watch this one. Remember the intense stairway sequence in the first movie? Remember how it was all shot in one take, or at least looked like it, so you could really get into it? Remember how the camera was always on Tony Jaa when he was fighting or doing a stunt, so you could see that it was him doing it and not camera tricks or CG? Yeah, they did the opposite of that and manage to take the greatest movie martial artist out there, and make his fights boring. There wasn't a -single- fight that got me excited. Theyre constantly cutting from one actor to the next, and most of the guys here don't even attempt to make the action flow. The first example that comes to mind is this horribly done fight between a girl, 20 (her rank and apparently the only name she goes by), and another underground fighter. They practically take turns you block, I punch, you kick, I dodge. How did something so bad make it into the sequel to something so great? You may think Im in love with the first movie with how Im talking about this one, but if you have the misfortune of watching it, youll understand. Theres nothing special here. Even the motorcycle gang from the first Protector is brought back. I smiled so big when they appeared, thinking oh man, here we go! because their scene was one of many awesome ones before. Nope. Instead we get a downright dull chase on rooftops, that are clearly sets, while Tony runs from them Tom and Jerry style until he finally start taking them out. What happened?

The biggest offender for me was the special effects. Id tell you to take a shot each time you can tell somethings shot on a green screen, or someone is edited into a fight to make it look like they're really being hit so hard that they go spinning in a weird way, but youd be dead of alcohol poisoning in less than 20 minutes. One scene about halfway through had to be rewound several times because I couldn't believe what I saw. When two thugs hit a burning wall, they fall to the ground, and as they roll away, the guys change color. Like, theres a clear change in the color they were when they started to roll, then after they did. Its not a change in lighting either, just poor editing and effects. Motorcycles flying into a train, only to barely fly away and stay in-tact was weird. And Im pretty sure that when some people hit the water after falling from a roof or bridge or whatever, that the splashes happened before they even touched it. I had to wonder if they tried to use special effects on RZA to make his acting slightly better than usual. Does this guy really need to be in so many martial arts movies just because he likes them and is knowledgable? Ill give him credit on that, since he knows his stuff, but that doesnt mean he needs to be in them when he brings nothing to the table. Wait until you see the faces he makes during a fight. Youd think he was posing for animators.

At first I considered giving this movie 1 star. Theres nothing I liked about it. Poor Tony Jaa doesnt do even 1/4 of what he normally does (or is this what he normally does now?), theres nothing captivate you, the plot was thrown together during a lunch break, and the best actor in the whole thing is the elephant. Then I remembered that I laughed a lot during the first half, before I got so bored that I stopped reacting to anything. The bad special effects had me laugh out loud a lot in the beginning, and rewinding the weird change in color bit is something for the books. I hate to see this happen to Tony Jaa, since hes such an amazing fighter and stuntman. A real director needs to get him and use him in something before he makes more of these.",1421280000,,6059,4.334801762114537

204872,3,3918810143,"Its been many years since the original and I think Jaa's flavour may have worn off already, the guy is very talented when it comes to stunts and fighting but the film as a whole is not as classic as the original warrior king or Ong-Bak, I think he's just not good at sequels as Ong-bak 2-3 got worse as they went along, but still this movie is not as bad as Ong-bak 3 at least with plenty of action from start to finish, it should still at least satisfy people, the story is plugged on the back of the DVD saying he's framed for killing a gangster boss and gets mixed up in a gang of underground fighters on a secret mission which he must bring down, yes that happens but primarily this story yet again is about getting his elephant back again that was stolen from him, the elephant is like his brother and nobody gets in his way, its a lame story but any good excuse I guess for a collection of martial arts displays, there are plenty of action scenes, a rooftop fight with motorbikes, there's a stylish fight in a room of fire while his feet are on fire, there's a hilarious scene where Jaa fights somebody while their feet are electrified on a train track and as they kick they make light-sabre sounds, yes its corny as hell Feet-sabre battle it is! you have to watch just to believe that scene alone, plus various other fights and action especially towards the end, its nothing we didn't see in previous movies but great fun bone crunching none the less I guess, the cast is good, some usual faces pop up, Rza plays the main villain and it was at least good to see JeeJa Yanin the female Jaa equivalent from the movie chocolate (2008) for a Thai movie its pretty big, not as big as the original, there's a tad too much green screen effects in places too which really spoil the movie too, if you like Jaa check it out as you won't get much better any time soon, fun martial arts action but a little more of a let down than last time.",1420848000,,1936,4.235135135135135

I loved the first protector and this one did have some really great ideas and potential but I couldn't get past the bad CGI used throughout the movie. Early Jaa movies reminded me of early Jackie Chan with outrageous stunts where you would say ""I can't believe no one died doing that"". This one had some stunts but most of the crazy stuff was done using really schlocky CGI which took away any sense of awe.

On a positive note there was a young girl (I heard she was the star of the Jaa produced Chocolate) who was amazing.

It's an bad attempt of showing he is some kind of Jackie Chan.

1 hour 11 min into the movies, (this is a very long dull movie), action scenes seem to start but by then you're worn out.

The good thing is the girl from Chocolate is in this. Watching her fight is very entertaining cause she is smaller & weaker. & she tries so hard.

I don't think I can disagree with any point the other reviewers have made who gave this movie 1 star. I have been pleased with all the other Tony Jaa movies I have seen. And if you throw in Jeeja Yanin what could go wrong? This movie demonstrates the answer. I might give this movie 2 stars for the fights with Marrese Crump (Number 2). Other than that the fights are - ""Tony gets hit a lot and runs away"" (repeat MANY times), ""Jeeja gets hit a lot and is rendered helpless"" (repeat MANY times). Neither of them are allowed to demonstrate the abilities we have seen in all their other films. And the fights are just 'ordinary' - no interesting use of props or environments. If this were their first movie it might be understandable. (This wasn't actually made 10 years ago was it?)

This movie could have been so much more as a martial arts film, but instead what we got was a movie with a ridiculous plot, bad special effects, and even worse acting, especially on the part of those whose native language is English (eyes *RZA*). SPOILER: One of the more ridiculous parts of the movie was when #2 and Tony Jaa's character Kham wet their feet and had an electric fight on the subway rails. The sound effects were ripped straight out of Star Wars. Really, you wouldn't be out of your mind if you thought that #2 and Kham were having a light saber fight with their feet. I laughed more at this scene than I did during the entire twenty plus seasons of The Simpsons.

The only thing I saw was BAD CG, repeated action sequences with BAD CG, yet again with some stupid story line which is a joke.

204904,2,3918810143,"A disappointing Tony Jaa vehicle, Protector 2 being (of course) the sequel to the original Protector film. In that movie we saw the simple but lethal country chap played by Jaa have his elephant stolen. And being a one man wrecking ball our main man followed, demolishing gangs in brilliantly choreographed fight scenes with brilliant stunt work and imagination. The movie felt expansive party because a chunk of it was set in Sydney, Australia.

Well keep hold of those memories because you'll need them to wend your way through Protector 2. A visibly different looking Tony Jaa here has eschewed his normal reluctance to go down the wire-work path and instead we get lots of it and dodgy CGI (which almost every other reviewer has remarked upon). The whole film feels flat and uninspired.

The plot? Well here goes:  in this movie we see the simple but lethal country chap played by Jaa have his elephant stolen. And being a one man wrecking ball our main man follows, demolishing gangs in..... err.... tediously choreographed and never ending fight scenes. Honestly most martial arts movie fans will allow a lot of suspension of disbelief but I'm sorry, half way through a bunch of the fights here you'd be dead. They are interminable. By which I mean they go on forever. And when I say they go on forever, man do they go on forever. Just forever. You know, way past any point had been made. Just forever. Beyond any sort of acceptable exposition of skill. I mean they just go on forever. I could go on forever about how these fight scenes go on forever just like in the bad old days of grainy 70's chop-socky flicks.

The acting is weak. Which is to be expected. The sub-plots are boring and heck, the main plot is such a tiny fraction of the film you don't really get to feeling connected in any way to what our hero is trying to achieve. You don't really dislike the bad guys either apart from how lame they are, how distinctly non-threatening they appear and honestly........

A poor film even by cheaply done action flick standards given how little joy comes off the screen. Honestly, there is as much feeling as you'd expect there to be in a script reading session.

In summary: Action and fight sequences that are interminable to the point of stupidity that only the most generous viewer could excuse. Poor acting, poor plot and what plot there is gets little screen time which means the viewer has nothing vested in the endless fight scenes. No tension and no emotional 'hand-holds' for the audience.

""Ong Bak"",  ""The Raid"" 1&2, ""Chocolate"", ""Tom Yum Goong"" and classics like ""Once Upon A Time In China"" and ""Police Story III: Supercop"" and epics like ""Ip Man"", ""Fearless"", ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon""band even fun films like ""The Twins Effect"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle"", I was eagerly awaiting to see the return of Tony Jaa in ""Tom Yum Goong 2"". Is that Tony Jaa magic still there? Yes. Are there some good fight scenes? Yes. Was it awesome having Jija Yanin and Tony Jaa in the same film together? Yes. But that is where it ends. The film is plagued by horrible CGI and 3D effects, bad editing, bad acting (especially The RZA), bad writing and a lame story. ""The Raid 2"" blows ""Tom Yum Goong 2"" completely away in every way. TYG2 is borderline B movie fodder. But, for what is it, the film is still fun and action packed. I would suggest renting it to see if it is your flavor first. Some reviewers may be a little too hard on the film as it is not that bad. ""Chocolate"" is even a much better film. But. ""Tom Yum Goong 2"" is better than ""Raging Phoenix"". It seems as though the filmmakers who made TYG2 were going for mainstream appeal on this one when they should have just kept it real with no CGI, no 3D effects and no wires and let Jaa and Jija do their thing.

UPDATE:

After a second viewing, I must say that I really enjoyed the film much more than I did the first time. If you can get pass some of the cheesy and even abysmal acting (RZA), you are in for a pretty good martial arts ride with some great fight scenes. The story is a ""been there, done that"" for sure but the action scenes and fighting scenes do actually deliver the goods. Don't go in expecting ""The Raid 2"", the original ""Tom Yum Goong"" or ""Ong Bak"" and you might just have a blast with ""Tom Yum Goong 2"".

204930,4,3918810143,"First let me start by saying that if you watch this movie you must first keep in mind that so many factors stopped this from being what it could have been. Factors such as contracting issues, being absent for 3 years and the crazy idea of adding 3D effects. Once you take those into account you can stop and look at this as not necessarily a comeback for Jaa but rather a step through the door back into our line of sight. This is more of a ""remember me?"" tone rather than a ""I'm back!"" kind of statement.

Now, I won't go into all the plot details of the movie because frankly it could be summed up in two words.....kidnapped elephant. The fights are solid enough; however if you are looking for Tony to preform his usual stunts shown in his previous projects, your not going to get the same treatment. whether it's because of the contracting issues or the break he took for so long being the problem here is anyone's guess. There can be so many things pointed out in this movie that could make you shack your head, from cheap explosions to wire work and eye soar slow motion scenes.

On the flip side there are also a lot of good things as well. All though Tony doesn't really have his groove back in this movie, his presence on screen is still tougher than ever. Jeeja has been said to be underused in the film but personally I believe it was just enough, so as to not take away the camera from Tony. Fight scenes are put together pretty well and the wire work (unfortunately used) is done with good taste for the most part. And by good taste I mean its used in more practical situations. I'll put it this way; you won't see anyone jumping four stories for a single kick and you won't see anyone doing 4 backflips into a one finger hand stand on a single blade of grass.

Elements from the first film are replicated in the second to show a sort of signature for the Tom Yum Goong series. (*Spoiler*)Such as the biker scene, it mirrors the scene in the first where Tony must dodge all the BMX and Roll bladders coming from every direction. The project is a complete mix of equally bad and good elements. The worst element I would have to say is the RZA. Now I do admire his interest in martial arts and the martial arts movie scene. Honestly I have to give him some points for stepping up in a time where not a lot is being done. I mean lets face it, the martial arts movie community has really been suffering to put out not just decent films but enough period. It almost feels like you have to wait three years to get two films put out for the entire genre. But no matter how much good you do facts are facts.

Fact; RZA stinks. He is horrible. He can't act, can't fight and to be honest the movie would have been much better without him. And before anyone says it; this is not a because he's black thing, I'm black and I think that fool needs to just hang it up. Now after hearing that, anyone would probably pass on this film and wait for Jaa to put out something else. But before you pass judgment you have to know about the best element of this film.

He goes by the name of Marrese Crump. Known in the film as No. 2, Marrese picks up all the action pieces that Jaa seems to drop. Not only does Marrese Crump show that he's more than a match for Jaa, he even sometimes manages to outshine him in his own film. The way crump moves and executes every punch and every kick....it's like a smooth fighters poem that can only truly be understood if you were in the ring with him. Giving a look on screen of the expression ""talk with your fist"" a whole new light. Crump is fast, skilled and in this line of work a new face. I have no doubt that we will be seeing more of him in the near future.

Overall Tony Jaa is not at his best in this movie but he's not at his worst either (ong bak 3). I enjoyed Tom Yum Goong 2 and took it for it's entertainment value and fight scenes. And besides I don't remember Jet li or Jackie chan making every movie a hit. There are some bad films in their closet that I'm sure they would like to forget but we all still own anyway (Romeo must die,/The tuxedo).",1402272000,,4092,4.179974651457541

It is the martial arts action that the world wants to see from the 'once upon a time fantastic' Tony Jaa.
Man!! What happened to Tony? Maybe old age has caught up
with him. The martial arts he showed in this film was really mediocre and lame.
I remembered the action scenes in his earilier film ""Ong Bak 1"".
The stunts and martial arts skills he beautifully showed to the world was AMAZING in that earlier film.
I was totally shocked by the low level of martial art choreography shown in this 'Protector 2'; it was pathetic; it was lacking in strength, imagination and grittiness which was so marvelously abundant in 'Ong Bak 1', the ground-breaking film that brought world recognition and acclaim to Tony Jaa.

In the end he uses Jaturongkabaat, so I wasn't sure what the whole point was. Thailand has just broken out in peace to the dismay of arms dealer LC (Rza) who plans on doing something about it....something that involuntarily involves Kham and his brother, the elephant...although don't accuse his dad of having slept with an elephant.

The movie is filled with action and has very little drama filler outside of what is needed for the story. There is an extensive rooftop fight involving motorcycles/scooters as well as Kham being chased by every cycle in Bangkok. There are CG explosions, some more impossible than others. It includes some good grindhouse metal music and light saber noises in one of the fights.

The film looks like it was made for 3D in many scenes. There is some eye candy with fighter number 20 (Rhatha Phongam). The film starts out with subplots, but does come together. It has subtitles, except at the end during the credits when they run outtakes.

I never really pay attention to the cinematography, directing or stuff like that.  I love movies with action and special effects, but I never critique stuff like that until now, everything in this movie was a joke.

204960,3,3918810143,"When the first Tony Jaa vehicle in three years has now finally been released, fans will definitely take notice. Cautiously, I think, because despite having set the standard for all martial arts action films more than once in his life, the general consensus seems to be that Jaa's output for the last half-decade has been substandard for a performer of his caliber. Somehow, a disappointment from Jaa can seem disproportionately significant: if, for example, Jean-Claude Van Damme or Jason Statham makes a stinker of a film, fans will shrug and hope for better next time, whereas the downgrade in quality of Tony's two sequels to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak-The-Thai-Warrior/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak - The Thai Warrior</a>&nbsp;have been met with open-mouthed disbelief by hardcore devotees, and their lament has been great. Regrettably, I have a feeling that their jeremiad will continue with the long-awaited sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Protector/dp/B000I0RNWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Protector</a>, which fixes some of the mistakes of Jaa's previous feature but replaces them with equally large snafus. ""The Protector 2"" is a very competent action movie with some good fight scenes, fun humor, and cool stunts, but for a lead star from whom nothing but the very best is expected, it disappoints on both ideological and practical levels.

The story: when his elephant is stolen for a second time, Kham (Jaa) follows him into the middle of an international terrorist plot orchestrated by a deadly arms dealer (RZA).

The story is as good as any place to start this review. Folks who thought that the original ""Protector"" was too simplistic in this department will be pleased that the story's become a bit more intricate: though Kham resumes his never-ending quest to rescue Khon the elephant, the plot incorporates the personal fight club of the villainous RZA and his plan to create political turmoil by assassinating the leader of a separatist nation via exploding elephant tusks. Kham is framed for murder and blackmailed into committing another one, while Jeeja Yanin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolate/dp/B001L67A4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolate</a>) plays the daughter of the first victim on a quest to wreak vengeance on Kham. Things get a little complicated, but never too difficult to follow. Viewers who doubted the validity of a character risking his life for an elephant in the last movie will probably be irked that this is again a major plot point, but because I actually liked that aspect, I appreciate that this story tries to explain the human-animal bond a bit more clearly.

Dramatically, everybody does fine. RZA probably gives the clearest acting performance of the ensemble, and the returning Petchtai Wongkamlao is a solid comedic anchor. Tony and Jeeja are good at showing rage. However, I am a bit disappointed in the utilization of the performers on a thematic level. On a small scale, there's Jawel El Berni, who showed such potential in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-II/dp/B00FRILRRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja II</a>, only to get built up and then killed in here before he gets to do anything cool. Similarly, Jeeja Yanin has been built up as the female equivalent of Tony Jaa for the last five years but is clearly presented as not only out of his league, but also the league of every other supporting character who gets to fight. Though he has no doubt waited for most of his life to contribute to his favorite genre of movie and plays the role of the rich villain very well, I question the decision for RZA to become an onscreen fighter (purportedly the best of his evil bunch, no less) in this particular film: nothing against RZA, but he looks out of place among all of these stunt players. And speaking of players, I'm disappointed that there is a noticeable deficit of specialty fighters: Marrese Crump (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Side-of-Town/dp/B002ZNNXDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Side of Town</a>) is definitely worth watching, but almost every other fighting villain in the movie is an interchangeable, faceless thug.

What might unpleasantly surprise people more than anything else is the drastic change in production style since the last movie. I'm talking about green-screening, folks: lots and lots of digitally imposed backgrounds. The filmmakers' decision to shoot the film in 3D probably played into this design, and to their credit, it does sometimes look fairly neat. However, it's still jarring to look at, especially coming from the team that has become known for the physical legitimacy of their productions and their knack for showing off the style and beauty of their native Thailand. Equally understandable for the 3D presentation but less easily forgiven is the absolute overkill of computer-generated imagery. This mainly takes the form of explosions and environmental effects, but even becomes an integral part of some of the fights, like when a brawl takes place on top of train tracks and CGI electricity crackles across the bodies of the fighters, complete with lightsaber sound effects. For newcomers to Jaa's films who are used to Hollywood-style action movies, this probably won't matter much and may even enhance the presentation. For established fans who enjoy these films specifically for their minimal use of the computer, it may seem like nothing less than a betrayal of trust.

But what matters above all else is the quality of the film's action content, and in this field, the movie succeeds...at least half of the time. Make no mistake, Tony Jaa is held to his own standard: if Van Damme, Statham, or anybody else was the star of this movie, the reaction would be practically orgasmic and include declarations that these guys were now as good as Jaa. Tony, however, carries the admittedly unfair expectation of needing to create a new chapter in the annals of action movie history whenever he shows his face onscreen. It might be a good idea for even the most diehard fans to shed this expectancy as Jaa prepares to make his debut in American films, but I can understand that the anticipation attached to the sequel of one of the best martial arts features ever made. Enjoying these scenes involves overlooking the green-screening and CGI bits, with the result that Tony & co. still show off some very neat moves. The first scene of substance is a rooftop battle between Jaa and a bunch of minibike riders, which turns into a chase scene involving probably a hundred riders and their girlfriends. This combined scene is at least fifteen minutes long and Tony plays it sort of in the style of Jackie Chan, with more clever evading than outright fighting. This changes quickly, and the remaining eleven encounters become more about hand-to-hand fighting. I give my personal approval to about seven of these, disowning anything that features wirework. As a rule, the standout matches feature Marrese Crump, who easily becomes the toughest onscreen opponent that Tony has faced and whose choreography is varied and fantastic: he's able to play both the swift powerhouse and the methodical fighting artist. RZA's fights are automatically better than anything he got up to in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-with-the-Iron-Fists/dp/B0090SI3ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man with the Iron Fists</a>, though you can almost see Tony holding back so's not to knock him on his butt.

Seeing as this might be the last Thai film that Tony appears in for two years, it's disappointing that ""The Protector 2"" isn't a better sendoff vehicle. Let me specify that it isn't a bad movie at all, but it is very disappointing that it's a film that could have been made in practically any country: Tony has a singular presence and performs acrobatic moves like few others, but the quality of the action and the style of the production could conceivably be replicated by Hong Kong or even American film studios - there's little about the movie that is uniquely Thai, save for the language (and even that is heavily diluted by RZA's English dialogue). Time will tell whether Tony Jaa will recapture the standard he achieved a decade ago, but for now, you will have to approach this film as a fun time-waster than a landmark adrenaline piece to fully enjoy it.",1397347200,,8574,5.442857142857143

204962,1,3918810143,"Let me be clear, I watched the first Protector at least a hundred times. I love Tony Jaa, he is a very talented martial artist. However, this is his worst movie yet, and from what I hear even Tony Jaa hated it. Apparently he had to do this under contract, and they brought in some Michael Bay wannabe to direct it. Tony Jaa's character gets his ass kicked by a girl and two black dudes throughout the whole movie. At the end the girl kills one of the black dudes with a needle, and the other one grabs onto the elephant tusks which they put bombs in to kill the Juktarbarangblah or however the heck you spell it and Tony kicks him with both feet sending him flying and detaching the tusk bombs which then conveniently explode killing the bad guy yet not harming Tony or the Elephant even though they were still just a few feet away.. The CGI is obvious in the final explosion. There's also a fight where they stand on subway tracks with wet shoes and kick at each other shooting sparks everywhere and they play the lightsaber sounds from Star Wars. Then there's a scene where Tony sets his feet on fire to fight. Tons of stupid bullcrap in this movie. I would definitely pass if you're a Tony Jaa fan and like his movies for the realism and brutal martial arts. If you just want a dumb popcorn flick and don't care about martial arts or anything though, go ahead and watch it at your own risk.",1396915200,,1393,4.300380228136882

Thailand has just broken out in peace to the dismay of arms dealer LC (Rza)  who plans on doing something about it....something that involuntarily involves Kham and his brother, the elephant...although don't accuse his dad of having slept with an elephant.

The movie is filled with action and has very little drama filler outside of what is needed for the story. There is an extensive rooftop fight involving motorcycles/scooters as well as Kham being chased by every cycle in Bangkok. There are CG explosions, some more impossible than others. It includes some good grindhouse metal music and light saber noises in one of the fights.

The film looks like it was made for 3D in many scenes. There is some eye candy with fighter number 20 (Rhatha Phongam). The film starts out with subplots, but does come together. It has subtitles, except at the end during the credits when they run outtakes.

In one translation ""worry"" was spelled ""wory"". When Raz spoke English they include English subscripts. Sometimes they wrote the profanity, other time they omitted or changed it to ""butt.""  I guess creating subtitles is a complex process like sausage making...you just don't want to know.
