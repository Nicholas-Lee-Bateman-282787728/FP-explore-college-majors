2668077,5,B000JBWWP6,"I recently repurchased the Second Series because my DVD player damaged two of the discs! I was so angry. Not only did I have to buy a new DVD set but a new DVD player. But this series enthralled me! Every episode on this DVD is so enjoyable. David Tennant is my favorite Doctor of the revamped series. Then again I've only seen two of the Doctors.

The show really goes into its own with Billie Piper and David Tennant having such an incredible chemistry together. I can honestly say that I'm enjoying this viewing the most. I'd seen it in 2007 and 2012 previously. This time was the best. The set has everything for you: Horror, monsters and wild action adventure! I loved seeing Daleks and Cybermen fighting one another was fantastic!  I always wanted to know what would happen had they fought one another. Now we all know. The Daleks would have wiped out the Cybermen! The Battle of Canary Wolf was epic, absolutely epic! I will never forget it. The tenacity of Rose who wanted to stay with the Doctor through thick and thin and her intensely emotional reaction to discovering that she could never return and see him again was riveting!

I give this set Five Stars. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. I'm the 369th to give this Five Stars and the 442nd overall to do a review.

2668148,1,B000JBWWP6,"After the amazing bd box set that I drooled over for years but accepted as too spendy to buy sat on my wish list *forever* I found through the magic of The Digital Bits that the seasons (sorry... *series*) were available individually for pre-order - small, bite-size increments that spread out would be easier to digest - and still be less spendy that that almighty boxed set. I pre-ordered S1 and S2 this spring - although they were several months apart. S1 shipped, was received and eagerly watched - no, not being a true hi-def source it isn't an absolutely stunning visual masterpiece, but it looked much better on my 57"" HD tv than the old dvds I had from years past. Worth it.
I waited on S2 to become available. Then S2 updated as something along the lines of ""see buying options"" - of which there weren't any..... then it just... faded away. S3 I had on my wishlist updated from bd to dvd.... because I wouldn't notice, right? And *now* I can get what appears to be a region-friendly import only for twice what the bd had listed for only a few months ago. *Not* worth it.

2668214,5,B000JBWWP6,"I got hooked the first time I saw Doctor Who on TV (the one where Christopher Eccleston plays as The Doctor).  So much so, that I have bought almost every single Doctor Who seasons/series on dvd (i.e. the ones where Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith play as The Doctor).  I still cannot accept or watch Peter Capaldi as The Doctor, because (1) his heavy Scottish accent is hard to understand, and (2) he played Caecilius in the ""Fires of Pompeii"" episode of Doctor Who (I just keep seeing Caecilius whenever I see Capaldi play as The Doctor).

In this series David Tennant takes over the role of playing the Doctor.  Christopher Eccleston was a ""tough act to follow"", but David Tennant did a good job.  Billie Piper reprises her role as Rose Tyler, and was fantastic.

The writing/scripts are excellent.  Everything starts with the writing/story, then everything else builds from there.  The acting is great, the music is great, the visual effects are great, etc.

I have watched the Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith Doctor Who series FIVE times, and will probably rewatch them again!  That is how good everything is in these series.

Funny thing is, after watching them five times, I am finally seeing scientific improbabilities/mistakes and some plot holes. This series must be great, since I did not notice these mistakes during my first three viewings.

I loved Billie Piper playing as Rose Tyler.  I wish she would have done more than two seasons/series.  Although, she does appear as a guest star in future series.",1457913600,,1557,4.893129770992366

2668227,5,B000JBWWP6,"To me and the Doctor Who audience in general, David Tennant was the best Doctor. And I think that Series 2 is his best series. Every story is great. They're all classics. Great monsters, great special effects. And Rose, as his companion, is stellar. You just can't beat this series!",1454371200,,282,4.66
2668228,5,B000JBWWP6,"MY FAVORITE SEASON!!!! The best episodes are New Earth, Idiot's Lanturn, Satan's Pit/Impossible planet, Fear Her, Tooth and Claw, and School Reunion. Warning: the last episode really does a number on your emotions. It's REALLY good, but it does do a number on your emotions. If you love New Who, you love David Tennant as The Doctor, and you love The Doctor and Rose, BUY THIS DVD set. You get to meet many new and old faces in it, some from season one, and even some from Classic Who. It also has wonderful invision and audio commentaries of all the episodes. Pay attention and try to catch as many references to ""Torchwood"" and ""Torchwood Institute"" as you can.  It is important to the arch of this season.",1453939200,,708,4.574803149606299

2668232,5,B000JBWWP6,"Doctor Who is a national treasure as well it should be and Tennant reprises the role of the Doctor as only he could with acting equal to Eccleston, my Doctor. I received this set for Christmas and it is a proper bumper gift set with all sorts of extras. There are video ""diaries"" by Tennant which female Whovians will love. with David looking straight in your eyes, face to face, as if having a FaceTime call with you. And there are video ""diaries"" by Billie Piper as well for the men though not as personal as David's. There are out takes and a handful of deleted scenes which actually add another level to the scripts. Especially the one for Age of Steel.

The best bits for me, though, are the commentaries. I'd heard about them for years but had never seen/heard them. One note: The commentaries are hidden under the SETUP screen on the TARDIS. I'm that daft a git that I never twigged that for a week!

My Doctor was Eccleston and I was absolutely gutted when he regenerated because, like Roae, I had no idea what was going on. I spent most of The Christmas Invasion waiting for this new ""Doctor"" to change back to Eccleston. But then...then...with a sword fight and a ""fightin' hand"" I had the Doctor again.

Do buy and enjoy this set. It's bigger on the inside. The acting of Tennant and Elisabeth Sladen and the fun scripts and extras make it a treasure for you and your children.",1451779200,,1388,4.435294117647059

Growing up with Tom Baker and loving him and K9  I knew I'd enjoy the new series as well and so I do.  The 2nd series introduced us to David Tennant as the 10th Doctor and we instantly fell in love with him and his oh so very complicated relationship with Rose.  My favorite part was seeing Rose meet Sarah Jane (Rest in Piece Elisabeth Sladen) and K9. We love each individual story as well as the series long story that they try to put the puzzle pieces together for.  This is a great set tohave on its own & even better if you have watched previous series (seasons for us USA folks) but there isn't any real need to have watched previous Doctor Who shows to enjoy this one wholeheartedly.
The discs worked great in our little DVD players and we enjoyed the extras that come along with a fun behind the scenes look.  I hope you'll enjoy it just as much as we did.",1444176000,,989,4.125

That said, even if 4, 5, and 6 played perfectly, 1/2 of a season is not worth the $40 price tag.

After  the doctor regenerates at the end of series 1 David Tennant takes over. Tennant is my favorite Doctor. Rose Tyler my favorite Compainion, I cried at the end of her role in the show, even when she appears from time to time, i still yelled at my tv for the change I didn't want to except the change. The 10th Doctor is in love with Rose even if he never actually tells her, even if she does.

Rose gets to meet and save her father, creates a paradox, releases monsters into the world, travels to another dimension, same earth, same time line, whole different set of people and problems.

My wife and I became fans of ""Doctor Who"" after our daughter started watching it and it probably says something about our family in that we really liked almost all of the episodes we watched.  However, I think David Tennant and Billie Piper really made the Second Series.  If you like weird scifi-fantasy, this is among the best of the TV programs of this genre ever made!

What I will do is list all of the episodes in this set because when I was looking to purchase ALL of the episodes including the specials, I had trouble finding out exactly what was in each set. Not knowing that, I had to order them and compare the episodes against the actual master list from the BBC. Season two is complete with no missing specials. The following are included in ""The Complete Second Series"".

 ""The Christmas Invasion""
1 ""New Earth""
2 ""Tooth and Claw""
3 ""School Reunion""
4 ""The Girl in the Fireplace""
5 ""Rise of the Cybermen""
6 ""The Age of Steel""
7 ""The Idiot's Lantern""
8 ""The Impossible Planet""
9 ""The Satan Pit""
10 ""Love & Monsters""
11 ""Fear Her""
12 ""Army of Ghosts""

After Season 4, the BBC aired 4 special episodes and are available on DVD and Blu-Ray as ""Doctor Who - The Complete Specials"". This is a 5 disc set with David Tennant (the 10th Doctor on the cover). They aired before Season 5. The Complete Seventh Series did not include ""Doctor Who - The day of the Doctor (50th Anniversary Special)"" or ""Doctor Who - The Time of the Doctor"" and must be purchased separately.",1426032000,,1173,4.3963133640553

2668352,5,B000JBWWP6,"Thus begins the true run of my all-time favorite Doctor: David Tennant. Even though it took me until the season finale 2-parter to truly see his genius I still enjoy this series. Only having 2 truly bad episodes of the lot is not too shabby, even if they are Love and Monsters plus Fear Her. Mostly just a fun series that has a more lighthearted Doctor. Though he certainly has gravitas in his dark times. I'll mostly just go over my opinion on the quality of the picture and sound since many before me have reviewed the episodes in depth on the reviews. I honestly thought the picture was going to be a lot worse but, even though it is not blu-ray quality, it is still a clear picture in all the scenes that matter only truly blurring during some massive motion happening which personally didn't bother me. The sound is nice for this release and the special features are always a treat. The menus may get a bit tiring with them all being the same main menu screen but don't let that stop you. There's no reason not to get the DVD version of this if you didn't want to drop $300 for the limited edition set. Plus, in all honesty, I am perfectly happy with the picture and sound in this set. Plus, I have multiple DVD players and only 1 blu-ray player so I can enjoy the quality of the second season wherever I go!

In short, if you don't have this set, get it. You know if you're reading these reviews you're gonna wind up buying it eventually so why not treat yourself now?",1422489600,,1474,4.302158273381295

2668355,4,B000JBWWP6,"Ahhhhhh.... Tennant. Been waiting to get to him. Right from the start, he captures his audience with his friendly yet dark personality: and with that big grin. He does a fantastic (I sound like Eccleston) job as the doctor. Starting in 2005 when he first showed up on our screens, he stayed on till New Year's day 2010: another 5 years, being the longest running doctor in the new series (second longest running doctor in the program, the first being Tom Baker, also a favorite). The reason the review is 4 stars is because Rose did not change her character the same way Amy did, growing from the bratty little teen wanting her way, to an adult making the right choice. Don't get me wrong, I really like Rose, but not the way her character changed.",1420675200,,748,4.507352941176471

I purchased a new copy of this season from a marketplace seller and it was a BOOTLEG!  And I researched and found out that these Dr Who  bootlegs infest the marketplace (and that other auction site too) and you stand a far stronger chance of getting a counterfeit copy from the marketplace than if you go directly through Amazon.  The quality of the bootlegs is garbage and they aren't worth the paper and plastic they are printed on.  Well I got burned so don't let it happen to you too.,1401494400,,608,4.243478260869566

the set's new lower price. The stories for this set are absolutely marvelous. bringing back Sarah Jane Smith really solidifies the
new series with the old. Bringing Mickey Smith on as a companion was a real bold move for the creators of this series. The series
in itself, kept up with the fast paced style of the first season. David Tennant's role as the 10th Doctor brought more fun and humor
to the new series than even was present in the classic series. Overall, I really liked this DVD set.",1394582400,,624,4.73394495412844
2668542,5,B000JBWWP6,"The resurrection of Doctor Who was an amazing feat. Taking a show that began four decades earlier and making it relevant, fun, and a success with fans and critics is unprecedented, mostly because there are no other shows that have survived that long, But the producers only had Christopher Eccelson for one season, so they had to go to the Tenth Doctor. So they selected Scottish actor David Tennant, who'd performed in several British TV series but was unknown in the US, except for appearing as Barty Crouch Jr. in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" Billie Piper returned as Rose Tyler, who is arguably the best companion of all. The chemistry between the two was powerful. Tennant's Doctor is funny, intelligent, and not a little dangerous, as he demonstrates in the first episode, granting mercy to an invader of earth, but only giving one chance. The quality of the stories throughout is high, showing the best of the series, and while I enjoyed all of the Tennant episodes, the interplay between him and Piper made this a special season.",1394323200,,1047,4.790055248618785

2668574,5,B000JBWWP6,"I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't sure whether or not I was going to like the 2nd series of Doctor Who. I have been a David Tennant fan for years, but Christopher Eccleston was always my Doctor. (Still is.) But for me, like always, anything that David Tennant touches is pure gold. He doesn't replace my favorite Doctor, Nine,  he just brings such a new unique, honest and lovable quality to the Doctor that you find yourself filled with so much joy just watching him. He doesn't replace Christopher Eccleston's Doctor, your heart just finds more room for him!
Honestly, season 2 is one of my personal favorites. Not only because of David Tennant but because of Billie Piper as well. The 1st season is where we meet and fall in love with Rose Tyler. A sweet, feisty, caring young woman who finds purpose and adventure with the Doctor. In the 1st season she helps the Doctor save the world, but as she travels in the Tardis she begins to grow & even hold her own. She doesnt need the Doctor to save the day, she can hold her own. While they fell in love in season one, its the 2nd season where their bond starts to grows & pretty soon they're inseparable.
Billie Piper brings so much truth and strength to Rose Tyler that she is as important to fans as the Doctor is. She becomes your best friend, the person you love and root for. Her and David Tennant are able to introduce a new facet to the relationship between her & the Doctor. They seem more open in their caring of one another and find an easy, silent camaraderie that bonds them even tighter. They love their characters and seem to get along so well and have so much joy for what they do that you can't help but see it onscreen.
Being brutally honest when I say you HAVE to buy this. It is gonna be, as the Doctor would say, FANTASTIC.",1394236800,,1787,4.318452380952381

Doctor Who needs little introduction - a TV sci-fi series that started way back in the 1960's that ran more or less continuously until the late 1980's and was required Saturday night viewing for generations of British kids. It was notable for it's scary monster of the week theme, the changing title role, the Doctor's slightly ramshackle mode of conveyance and the variety of ""Doctor's Companions"". Sadly, it was also notable for it's limited budget, wobbly sets and man-in-a-rubber-suit aliens. However, despite its failings, it gained a special place in the nation's consciousness and is looked back on with fondness by many.

After a seventeen year break, the series restarted in 2005 with new writers, Doctors and companions and it has gone from strength to strength since. The second season of the series' renaissance, with David Tennant taking up the Tardis' helm, featured 14 episodes, penned (for the most part) by the usual suspects - namely Moffat, Davies and Gatiss:

- ""The Christmas Invasion""
- ""New Earth""
- ""Tooth and Claw""
- ""School Reunion""
- ""The Girl in the Fireplace""
- ""Rise of the Cybermen""
- ""The Age of Steel""
- ""The Idiot's Lantern""
- ""The Impossible Planet""
- ""The Satan Pit""
- ""Love & Monsters""
- ""Fear Her""
- ""Army of Ghosts""
- ""Doomsday""

Why is it that The Doctor, who can travel anywhere in the universe, always ends up fighting off aliens who want to wreak havoc in London? It strikes me that the writers were either under some strange obligation to stick to Earth, or they lacked a lot in the way of imagination. Well, the second series, /does/ actually represent a huge improvement on the first. The stories seem a lot more exciting and inventive and there is an enjoyable self-awareness to it all. The aliens (even if they ARE still just blokes in rubber suits) look better - scarier, cooler, more imaginative. Even the earthly locations have a more sci-fi, less lo-budget feel to them, so things are definitely looking up.

Tennant, the new Doctor, is a big improvement on Christopher Ecclestone. Still worryingly manic, still rather patronising to ""his"" pet earthlings, but not quite so put-on loony. Billie Piper continues to chav it up, poor old Mickey tags along for the ride for a few eps and we even meet Sarah Jane Smith and K9. There are some real beezers too, not least The Rise of the Cybermen two-parter (god bless Roger Lloyd Pack), The Girl in the Fireplace and another two-parter "" ""Impossible Planet/Satan Pit"". If only the Tardis could work up enough whizz to get out of Sol system a little more often...

Oh, and I really enjoyed the controversial Love and Monsters. A welcome break from the Doctor, some great acting from Mark Warren - poignant and gently comic by turns - and a plot that plays subtle tunes on your emotions. A five star episode, in my opinion.

The Ood: The Beast and his armies will rise from the pit to make war against God.

2668820,5,B000JBWWP6,"(MINOR FIRST SEASON SPOILER, NO SECOND SEASON SPOILERS)

I loved the first season.  Creative, witty, easy on the sci-fi (making it a bit more accessible to my partner), intelligent, funny, touching.  And the Doctor and Rose were full of heart.  So when they changed doctors at the end, I was a bit shocked, and wondered how I could love a new Doctor as much.

THE NEW DOCTOR

Hard to believe, but David Tenant is even more amazing than the previous Doctor.  As exuberant as Christopher Eccleston was as the ninth Doctor, David Tenant has an even wider range of acted emotions.  In particular, he is really good with darker feelings; you can watch his face change as his feelings make a transition, and he can do crazy things with his eyes to convey all kinds of feelings.  I really wasn't too sure about David Tenant at first - of course, he was mostly asleep when we first saw him, and it all changed when he woke up.

ROSE

I think the chemistry between the tenth Doctor and Rose is even better, both on-screen, and off-screen (in the excellent Confidential background clips on the sixth DVD, which MUST be seen to really get a deeper understanding of all that goes into making these shows).  There's more to be said about Rose, but no spoilers here.  I can say that her character developers over two seasons from timid shop girl through do-what-must-be-done to take-charge-and-give-orders-to-save-the-day.

STORY LINE

The stories are bigger.  First, there are story arcs that span multiple episodes, mainly around Rose and her family and friends, and they have a neat conclusion that tie things together in an unexpected way.  Second, there are a few two-part episodes which you think are finished, only one of the two-part episodes actually breaks into a later two-part episode, making it really a four-part one.

We are among the many who have not seen the original series.  Fortunately, the new series introduces us to important figures like the Daleks and the Cybermen.  For me, the height of the season, or one height of the season anyway, is when these two very stylized creatures meet, with hilarious results.  There is also a dramatic height of the season in the same two-part story, but no spoilers here.

I thought the episodes at the beginning of the season started off a bit slower and less impressive than the first season, but as the season got going, the stories got better - MUCH better.  In this season we have what must be some of the most classic episodes of the whole series.  Hard to say, since we have not started season 3 yet.

Last thing to mention is Torchwood.  In season 1, we met Captain Jack Harkness and a few actors who later went on to play members of his team on Torchwood.  We saw Torchwood first, so they really stood out.  In season 2, we meet one more future Torchwood cast member.  More to the point, the word ""Torchwood"" is thrown out repeatedly in several episodes, the most important of which is when Queen Elizabeth establishes the Torchwood Institute.  Later in the series, we see what Torchwood has become in current day London, though it is nothing at all like the branch in Cardiff that is headed up by Captain Jack.

BOTTOM LINE

This is brilliant TV.  Original writing, fine acting, appealing actors.  A blend of drama, humor, sci-fi, and camp.  Tremendously inventive in the physical production of challenging sequences (you HAVE to see episode-by-episode background on how they made them on the sixth DVD to really appreciate what went into this work).",1337299200,,3506,4.7388429752066115

It's the REAL beginning, however short (7 min), of ""The Christmas Invasion,"" the first episode of Season Two. David Tennant discovers his new fleshly abode in a bit more detail than is provided in Episode One. How wonderful that this Doctor Who watched the earlier series as a child, and in fact decided to become an actor partially based on his desire to play the Doctor. A great lesson in talent and persistence paying off.

The extent of the Who oeuvre is supernatural. Russell T. Davies rescued the TARDIS and allowed his stars to fully flesh out the Doctor; their talents and quirks enrich the Who tradition. Christopher Eccleston as the first new Who was great, no doubt about it. David Tennant is superb, even more nuanced, intense, and wacky. He IS Doctor Who, with all the layers of previous incarnations busting out all over. Sadly, the fifth season is being muddled  by Moffat, doing a turn as the infamous John Nathan-Turner. JNT also picked a young replacement and went on to ruin Doctor Who.

Tom Baker's hippy Who is a treat, mindful of a more creative period (before JNT). There was a mysterious brain-drain in the 1980s, during the Thatcher and Reagan era, that resulted in horrible Doctors. Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy were costumed up in garb that proved producer JNT had no creativity or respect for fans. Thankfully, the current generation reflects the real Doctor Who in character and look, with the rag-tag thrift-store appeal of the original 1960s & 1970s Doctors.

This new generation of Doctor Who restores the intelligent alien with the eccentric grace of Hartnell, Troughton, Pertwee, and Tom Baker. David Tennant is amazing as Doctor Who, and gave his all throughout his tenure, with his own mischief and sinuous mind. Tennant's incarnation flares with the elegant and quirky mannerisms of the brilliant Who, ""I know what kind of hand this is, it's a fightin' hand...."" As Hartnell declared as he leapt upon an opponent with glee, ""I'm so used to outwitting the opposition that I forgot the gentle art of fisticuffs"" (The Romans: Story 12).

The one reservation is that Rose is too much the waiting pet, hoping for the pat on the head, and her alternative life at the end is needlessly sad. The role of Jackie is pitch-perfect. Billie Piper acts with amazing conviction. The characters of Zoe (Troughton years) and Sarah Jane Smith were great female leads, brilliant and assertive. Why couldn't Rose have just gone on to a good life with her parents and boyfriend, grateful for the Doctor Who Experience, instead of mascara smeared tear-stained grief? Give the girl a break.

Also interesting that the Doctor became romantically attached to Rose, but the way they broke it off was also good.  I'm wondering if other universes mean there are other Doctors?

In the older series' it seemed like they were always going to other planets and exotic settings, and even though their special effects were primitive back then it still made for an interesting story.

The Cybermen and Daliks appear in this series - they are really something. A little cheesy, but still great at the same time - maybe because they are a little cheesy. Believe it or not, Satan makes an appearance as well in this series.

I am sorry that the Rose character will not continue into series 3, as she and the Doctor went well together. The current Doctor will continue which is good. It seems that Jackie (Rose's mother and a great character) will not either, nor will Mickey - I won't explain or that will ruin the last episode of the series for you.

We have a new Doctor, David Tennant. And although I would have liked to have seen Christopher Eccelston in the show for a bit longer, David Tennant does make a great Doctor himself. By just watching his premiere episode, you know that David Tennant was the right man for the job. We also have a great companion, the best since Sarah Jane Smith, depart. Billie Piper as Rose Tylor proved to be a fantastic assistant for the Doctor, and now with season two's finale we see her leave in one of the most dramatic and emotional (and best) goodbyes there ever was for a companion.

Dig a bit deeper, watch a bit closer, and learn a bit more.  I've since got two other Tennant sets and am starting to consider ""other"" Doctors...all this from someone who doesn't like sci-fi. We never stop learning about ourselves, I guess. Oh, wait, that's yet another English Teacher-loving theme that runs through the series!",1268611200,,1018,5.189024390243903

2668954,5,B000JBWWP6,"One of the things that's hard for a show to do, even a long-running series, is to match the success and strong story elements of the first season the second time around. But the cast and crew of ""Doctor Who"" not only matched the success of season one, but actually surpassed it with the second season. David Tennant, taking the TARDIS keys from Christopher Eccleston, proves to be a fantastic successor to the role of the Doctor, bringing a lot of humor and gravitas to the role, and is supported by the equally-fantastic Billie Piper as his companion, Rose Tyler. Coupled with a brilliant supporting cast, strong storytelling, fantastic visuals and strong music, this is a terrific season of the show.
Highlights include: ""The Christmas Invasion,"" David Tennant's premiere episode; ""Tooth and Claw,"" which brings werewolves into a story of aliens after Queen Victoria; ""School Reunion,"" which reunites the Doctor with Sarah Jane Smith and K-9; ""The Girl in the Fireplace,"" a brilliant episode from the always-brilliant Steven Moffat; the two-part ""The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit,"" which pits the Doctor against the Devil himself; and the two-part finale, ""Army of Ghosts/Doomsday,"" which features both a head-to-head battle between the Daleks and the Cybermen, and the exit of Rose as a companion in a final scene that will leave nobody with a dry eye.
The DVD release of series two is also improved over the first. The picture quality is fantastic, and the audio, a problem with the previous set, is much improved. Extras are fantastic, from David Tennant's video diaries to cut-down versions of ""Doctor Who Confidential."" Longtime fans and newcomers to the show will definitely want this set in their collection! Allons-y!

2668955,5,B000JBWWP6,"I'm a fan of the Doctor Who Series, and this season is my favorite. I was pleased with my order and have been watching episodes ever since. I like the product and I appreciated the seller's quick delivery and careful packaging.",1261958400,,227,4.560975609756097
2668956,5,B000JBWWP6,"First off, there is a minor audio issue with the surround background music overwhelming the dialogue of the actors.  I haven't found a resolution and just turned up my volume.  Subtitles/closed caption will help with this minor issue.  Also image is very crisp and special effects are wonderful on this DVD set compared to Sci-Fi channel airings.  Also, there are no shorted episodes like those aired on TV.

Now, it's onto my review of this DVD set.  This is a brilliant continuation where Christopher Eccelston left off in the first new series of Doctor Who.  David Tennant (regenerated 10th doctor) and Billie Piper (companion- Rose Tyler from the last doctor) start us with the Christmas invasion with the colorful cast of Jackie and Mickey who are Rose's mum and pal/pseudo-boyfriend.  Tennant quickly develops his similar style in loud and snide comments as Eccelston did last year.  However, he adds another side of humor which is more physical and serious than Eccelston.  Piper is pretty much herself and the mother character is more hilarious and kookier than Rose's sweet nature.  Insecure Mickey is a great contrast to Piper's commanding tone.  Episodes fit nicely one after the other.  Favorite episodes are listed below and Doctor Who Confidential are on the last disc for behind the scenes.

* Rise of Cybermen (Part 1)
* Age of Steel (Part 2)
* New Earth
* Girl in Fireplace
* Impossible Planet (Part 1)
* Satan's Pit (Part 2)

Here are a listing of our favorite heros/villans.

* Cybermen- still the same but interesting storylines
* Daleks- slightly upgraded with levitation powers (I prefered the rolling droids)
* K-9- robot dog from the Tom Baker years
* Sarah Jane- from the 3rd & 4th doctor series
* Jackie- Rose's Mom and also cougar who preys on young lads and the Doctor
* Mickey/Ricky- Rose's buddy and parallel universe ""Mickey""

Also, here are the last couple of episodes before actor Tennant regenerates to actor Matt Smith.  I have the reviews for these episodes already available on DVD.

* The New Doctor (with David Morrissey)- Christmas special 2008
* Planet of the Dead (with Michele Ryan)- Easter special 2009

The soon to be released Tennant final episdoes are as follows:

* The Waters of Mars- aired November 2009
* End of Time (Parts 1 and 2)- will air December 2009 and January 2010",1259452800,,2324,4.832911392405063
2668957,5,B000JBWWP6,"It always struck me that Christopher Eccelston's Christmas Day interview with the BBC in 2005--the day that ""Doctor Who"" was rebooted for the 21st century--was ironic.  He knew, because the complete first season was shot, that he wasn't coming back; which was why his mention of the Doctor's ability to regenerate was so...telling...
  But maybe Chris also had a clue about the coming storm that was David Tennant.
  Tennant's Doctor--Ten, as other reviewers refer to him--spiritually does connect back to Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor, but David captures a joy in his Doctor that Baker didn't seem to have.  Both their Doctors seem to understand the ""stream of thought"" concept in line delivery that captures the TimeLord's essence...but Tennant has a fun with his interpretation that Baker either wasn't allowed or couldn't express in his 1974-1981 run.  As a result, David pushes the envelope from where Eccelston had the Doctor at the end of his run.  While being far more joyful, Tennant also seems to capture the core sadness and anger of The Doctor, and those moments seems starker and more striking when they occur.
  Because Russell T. Davies allows Ten to be more of a romantic, there are some stunning moments through the season.  In many ways, ""School Reunion"" and ""The Girl In The Fireplace"" plays as a two-part episode.  ""School Reunion"" brings Elisabeth Sladen back to the Whoniverse as The Doctor's former companion, Sarah Jane Smith, and allows for a discussion--aside from the main storyline--that the previous run of Doctor Who might not have broached.  The scene in which Sarah Jane, sneaking through the school at night, discovers the TARDIS, and then turns to find Tennant and realizes who he is--is joyous, but quickly turns heartbreaking when Sarah Jane vents at The Doctor for leaving her...which in turn, makes The Doctor talk about his reality--that he loses those he cares about, no matter what.  This is a theme that plays out in ""The Girl In The Fireplace"", where the TimeLord develops a strong attraction to Sophia Myles' Madame de Pompadour (Tennant's great line after Myles kisses him--""I just snogged Madame de Pompadour!!!""--is a wonderful kick).
  Tennant's interpretation of The Doctor is a wonderful match for Billie Piper's Rose Tyler.  Watching the Doctor grow closer to Rose--we understand his reluctance, but she won't deny her feelings--is marvelous.  Camille Coduri's Jackie Tyler is scattered and charming, and Noel Clarke's Mickey Smith matures courageously and sadly through the series--Mickey comes to accept Rose's attraction to The Doctor, but also comes to grip with larger responsibilities in ""Rise Of The Cybermen"" and ""The Age Of Steel"" that give him a place and purpose.
  This box set is about the line that opens--and closes--this season, which is why this review is titled as such.  From the opening to the Daleks/Cybermen smackdown that finishes the season in ""Army Of Ghosts"" and ""Doomsday"", this season allows for a more thorough introduction to The Doctor and his world, allows longtime viewers to see the heart (Hearts, since he has two) of the preeminent character in British Science Fiction.  Though there will always be an element of mystery clouding The Doctor, Davies and Tennant allow us to see more of the TimeLord than we've seen over the years...his strength, his humor, his devotion to life and this planet...in short, a greater understanding of ""who the 'ell he is..."", and this is continued in Tennant's run in Seasons Three and Four.  This set--highly recommended.",1258156800,,3536,5.111304347826087
2668958,5,B000JBWWP6,"In my view this is the single best season of Dr. Who.  I know that's saying a lot - and I know a lot of people would disagree with me.  It's pointless to say all the stories in Series 2 are great - because virtually all Dr. Who episodes from all the seasons are great.  I think, more than anything else, it's the character of Rose Tyler that puts this season over the top. She was great in Series 1; but she's almost sublime in Series 2.  Plus, this season contains the single most poignant story in the entire Dr. Who repetoire.  Though I agree with Colin Baker, who reportedly said that ""The Empty Child"" (from Series 1) is just about the best Dr. Who episode; to me ""The Girl In The Fireplace"" from Series 2 is the most poignant.  It's far from the best Dr. Who; the alien menace is almost comical in the way that some of the aliens from the earliest Dr. Who episodes were; and the story line does seem stretched a bit.  But there's something so almost magical about the episode, and so unexpectedly sad about the ending.  You get the feeling that if Dr. Who could have chosen a true soul-mate from among all the women he had ever encountered, it would have been this ""Girl In The Fireplace.""  And the two-part episode ""The Satan Pit"" shows the depth of the bond between The Doctor and Rose more succinctly than any other episode; he is willing to place his life entirely in her hands - that's how much he's come to trust her instinct for doing the right thing.  Then the season finale, another two-part episode, brings their relationship full circle.  It, too, is one of the most poignant Doctor Who episodes - and one of the most innovative, pitting two of the Doctor's greatest enemies against themselves as well as against the world.  All in all, this season is nearly perfect.",1249430400,,1784,4.405487804878049
2668959,5,B000JBWWP6,"David Tennant's first series as the doctor proves a worthy follow-up to Eccleston.  Geeky and manic, Tennant's energetic Doctor is quite possibly the most charismatic to date.  Billie Piper returns as Rose and together, they take on some new monsters and old foes.  Every story's a winner in this season, ranging from Daleks vs. Cyber-men, to the return of K9, to battling the Devil himself.  While new viewers can easily pick up from here, this series will especially please fans of the old series.  And don't forget, there's also a plethora of great special features, most notably some fantastic deleted scenes.",1246579200,,613,5.02970297029703

Gatiss returns to write the wonderful ""The Idiot's Lantern"" (set in the 50's); ""Love & Monsters"" is hysterical; ""School Reunion"" brings back Sarah Jane and has Anthony Head (Giles from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as a baddie); ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" is wonerfully inventive; and the Cybermen are back.",1237680000,,545,4.71578947368421
2668992,5,B000JBWWP6,"When word came down that Christopher Eccleston was being replaced as Doctor Who to say the least I was hard to convince.  They say that the Doctor that you started with forever becomes ""your"" doctor and I will second that motion.  That being said David Tennant does grow on you take it from someone who found out first hand.  You have to judge each individual season on its own merits.  So as to the episodes themselves
New Earth is a good way to open up this shows the Doctor in a most traditional role solving problems that others have never considered the solution to.

I consider it the best episode of the entire Second season.

That being said the second episode Tooth and Claw is good because we get to meet Queen Victoria and see how exactly the Torchwood Institute was founded.

For that same reason School Reunion is also good because it actually reintroduces a companion of the Doctor's from the old days Sarah Jane Smith.  A meeting of the minds between the old and the new its pretty awesome.

The Girl in the Fireplace is also a good episode it tells with a historical aspect (the Madam) but also the consequences of the nature of travel and what it does to those we leave behind.

I could see where you would like Rise of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel but the trek fan in me is reminded to much of the Borg although the idea of alternate realities is very cool.

If the second season has a weak link it is probably The Idiot's Lantern Television sucking the life out of people is not my idea of a good storyline sorry.  I never blame the excellent actors and the chemistry between them for making the best of a bad script.

I know I already said New Earth was my favorite and it still is but The Satan Pit and the Impossible Planet are also very cool.  I mean a space station orbiting a Black Hole what's not to like about that storyline?

I know people go nuts about Love & Monsters and how funny it is but I never much cared for the episode.

""Fear Her"" is a nice spooky little episode

Doomsday and Army of Ghosts are a nice farewell to Rose Tyler.  Its always a shame to see a companion go but if you have to go this is a nice way to go out.
Overall-Good season with a few misfires but nice solid entertainment",1237248000,,2233,4.263657957244655
2668993,5,B000JBWWP6,"I was worried about how much I'd like the new Doctor, who was essentially replacing 'My Doctor', but it couldn't have been a more natural transition.  David Tennant is just as wonderful as the Tenth Doctor.  He brings his own quirkiness to the character of the Doctor, while still keeping some of the dark, emotional side brought in by Eccleston.  Billie Piper is back, as well, as his companion.  The chemistry between Tennant and Piper is equal to Eccelston, and possibly even better than the first season.

Season 2 brings back all the good things about the first and adds yet more to the Doctor Who universe.  It brings laughter and tears and a bittersweet conclusion that will have you reaching for a tissue.

If you have any doubts about continuing on past season one, don't.  Tennant delivers, as do the creative staff who have brought us yet another great season of our favorite Doctor!",1233100800,,894,4.72258064516129

2669023,4,B000JBWWP6,"As a fan of the original series - especially the golden age of Tom Baker (when he was still taking the show seriously) - I have not been disappointed with the new ""Who."" From the wonderfully reworked title sequence and theme tune (so much better than the tinny version that introduced the show from late Baker onwards) the new series maintains much of the charm of the original without the wobbly sets. I loved Christopher Ecclestone's portrayal of the Doctor, so awaited this second season with a little trepidation. Although I find David Tennant's Doctor a little more superficial, he does a creditable job nevertheless.

But WHY OH WHY are BBC DVDs SOOOOOO expensive? Sure, they're generally a quality product, but that doesn't justify charging two to three times as much as for an equivalent US series.

Tennant not only lived up to the part, he has ecliped Eccleston in every way possible.  He is easily best Doctor since Tom Baker, and brilliantly meshes the serious and comdeic traits necesary to be the Doctor.  Some of these episodes really stand out and there is a nice mix in this set.  Blink may be the scariest Who episode I've seen---EVER.  Must see Who!!!!",1213747200,,712,4.543307086614173

Billie Piper comes back as the magical Rose Tyler and we are given a series where she not only has to handle the notion of a different looking Doctor, but she has to handle the fact that she's falling in love with him and we're given hints that he's falling in love with Rose.

Episode 1: New Earth: In the year 5 Billion and 23 the Doctor takes Rose to the new home of the human race, simply called New Earth and he takes her to the aptly named New New York. There the Doctor meets up with an old friend the Face of Boe but he stumbles upon a secret in the hospital basement, who is lurking there and what have they done with Rose?

Episode 2: Tooth and Claw: Landing in 1879 Scotland, the Tenth Doctor and Rose meet Queen Victoria, travelling with her to spend the night at the Torchwood Estate. However, a group of warrior monks have sinister plans for the monarch, and the full moon is about to summon a creature out of legend.

Episode 3: School Reunion: The Doctor goes undercover in a school as John Smith, children are mysteriously going missing and the Doctor needs to find out why. He meets not one but two old friends and Rose finds a bit of competition in one of them.

Episode 4: The Girl In The Fireplace: The Doctor accidentally stumbles across a derelict spaceship that seems to just be floating unmanned. The weirdest thing is that the spaceship has a fireplace but as he looks through it, he discovers it's a time window to 1727 Paris. What he finds there isn't a bunch of French Aristocrats, he finds something much more sinister

Episode 5: Rise of the Cybermen: After the TARDIS makes a crash landing on the Earth of another universe, Rose discovers her father is alive and rich, Mickey encounters his alternative self, and the Tenth Doctor learns one of his oldest and deadliest foes is about to be reborn.

Episode 6: The Age Of Steel: Lumic sends out a signal across London through the earpieces to get everyone walking towards Battersea Power Station to get the upgrade. The Doctor isn't just fighting a robot army, he's fighting the conscience of Rose who's determined to save her Father.

Episode 7: The Idiots Lantern: In 1953 London, the police are abducting people from their homes. The people of Britain gather around their new-fangled ""tele-vision"" sets to celebrate the new Queen's coronation -- but something strange is affecting the signal.

Episode 8: The Impossible Planet:The TARDIS lands in a base on a planet orbiting a black hole, an allegedly impossible situation -- according to the physics of the show -- that stumps even the Tenth Doctor. The base crew are drilling to the centre of the world, to claim the power that keeps it in orbit for the good of the Human Empire. However, an ancient evil is down there too, and he is awake...

Episode 9: The Satan Pit: With the TARDIS seemingly lost, Rose and the remaining humans are trapped on the base with the possessed Ood, while the planet floats helplessly towards a black hole. Meanwhile, the Tenth Doctor is about to discover exactly what ""Beast"" is trapped in the heart of the impossible planet...

Episode 10: Love & Monsters: An ordinary man named Elton Pope becomes obsessed with a man called the Doctor and his strange blue box, joining a group of like-minded people in hopes of finding him. But when the mysterious Victor Kennedy joins the group, the fun stops and Elton discovers a darker side to his hobby.

Episode 11: Fear Her: It's the 2012 London Olympics and in one street children are going missing and there's no explanation for it. Rose and the Doctor go on a quest to find out what's happening to the children but the key to this is a young girl called Chloe who likes to draw.

Episode 12: Army Of Ghosts: As the ghosts of loved ones appear, the whole world celebrates. But as the Doctor investigates he believes that there is a more sinister motive behind their appearence. And deep within the Torchwood tower, a mysterious sphere containing the greatest enemies of the Doctor is opened...

Episode 13: Doomsday: Earth becomes the battlefield for the greatest and deadliest war of all time, as the Daleks and the Cybermen clash with the whole universe at stake. The Doctor and Rose, reunited with old friends and Cybermen experts Mickey and Jake, race to find a way to bring the war to an end before it brings about the destruction of the whole of space and time. But the Doctor soon faces an even bigger dilemma - could ending the war mean the death of Rose?

This is an amazing series but we are given an unfortunate goodbye to Rose Tyler, how do we say goodbye? Well you will have to see for yourself.",1205020800,,4811,4.540415704387991

2669077,5,B000JBWWP6,"The 10th doctor is wonderful. I had seen him in Casanova and was impressed with him then. He does a wonderful job here and the chemistry between him and Billie Piper is evident. All in all a great series with a gut wrenching final episode. Yes, I cried a lot. Also wonderful are the behind the scenes Confidential series and David Tennant's Video Diaries. As a performer myself it is very interesting to see how the show is made as well as personal experiences of the cast. Definitely buy this.",1203120000,,494,4.5
2669078,5,B000JBWWP6,"The second season of the ""Doctor Who"" revival brings with it a new Doctor (David Tennant), a returning companion (Billie Piper), old friends, new enemies and a couple of old ones as well.  This DVD set covers all of season two and includes the Children In Need special which covers events immediately following the ninth Doctor's regeneration into the tenth.  Key stories in this second season include ""The Girl In The Fireplace,"" the quirky ""Love And Monsters,"" and the wonderfully excessive season finale, ""Army Of Ghosts/Doomsday.""

Tennant slides into the role of the Doctor seamlessly and appears to really be enjoying himself as he portrays his childhood idol.  While Eccleston's Doctor was fun, he had a very dark side lurking just beneath the surface.  The dark side still lives in Tennant, but his humorous and, quite frankly, cocky attitude suppresses it for most of the episodes in this season.  I also see parts of Peter Davison and Tom Baker's portrayals of the Doctor present in Tennant's performance.  Tennant's Doctor has a very appealing demeanor and it's easy to get lost in his vision of the Timelord.

Billie Piper reprises her role as Rose, the headstrong, curious companion of the Doctor.  As expected, hints of a romance are dropped throughout the season, and take a humorous turn with the return of Sarah Jane Smith (the excellent Elisabeth Sladen) in ""School Reunion.""  Mickey, Jackie Tyler and Rose's father, Peter, also return and take on bigger roles this time around.

Old enemies revisited include the always reliable Daleks and a revisioning of the Cybermen.  Although these new Cybermen are interesting, I miss the old version of the Doctor's gold-resistant enemies.  Cassandra, a new enemy in the new series, also makes a return in an interesting story that touches on medical ethics.

New enemies include include an extra-terrestrial werewolf in ""Tooth and Claw"" and maybe even the Devil himself in ""The Satan Pit.""  In ""The Girl In The Fireplace,"" we are introduced to some sinisterly silent clockwork androids.  ""Fear Her"" gives us a non-enemy in a truly touching story about a child who misses its family.  Overall, the new enemies are good, especially the werewolf in a legitimately suspenseful tale.

Special features included in this set include video diaries from Tennant and Piper, as well as running commentary on each episode.  Once again, we get to look a bit deeper into the production of the show in the ""Doctor Who Confidential"" segments.  Highlights include the ""School Reunion"" Confidential which catches old fans up with Sladen and K-9, and the ""Girl In The Fireplace"" confidential that includes a look at the read through of the story.

Overall, this season of ""Doctor Who"" is an excellent addition to the wonderful catalogue of the Doctor's many adventures.  While Peter Davison will always be my favorite, David Tennant's Doctor will struggle for second place with Patrick Troughton's Doctor until the end of time.

If you're not familiar with the old series, have no worries.  This set can be watched with no previous knowledge of the original.  It might be helpful to watch season one in order to pick up on a few things but that, too, isn't necessary.  If you're a fan of intelligent, quirky and sometimes hilarious science fiction, the second season of ""Doctor Who"" is just what you need.  I highly recommend this set.",1202774400,,3376,5.003584229390681

And as with series one, those who don't know much about the old series are still taken in. Quality production work all around. Lots of location shots (thanks to having production in Cardiff) which makes the show even better.

Back story with Rose's family and boyfriend are continued, helping give the show an anchor. David Tennant does a wonderful job as Doctor #10. As one friend said, he makes you say, ""Christopher who?""

2669151,5,B000JBWWP6,"Where do you begin on such an awesome mind-blowing season?  Even the pedestrian episodes, like ""Christmas Invasion"", ""New Earth"", ""Fear Her"" and ""Idiot's Lantern"" were still excellent just by sheer triumph of style alone: for example, watching people`s faces and identities get sucked into a TV set.  The second season still manages to nicely captures its own newness and the joy an old character rediscovering itself, and of a writing staff blazing into new territories of storytelling.  Yes, David Tennant may take some getting used to, but he will grow on you quickly.  Besides, when you have a Queen Victoria and a werewolf ""Tooth and Claw"" episode, there's no time to hold grudges.  Everything works marvelously this season--there's a Sarah Jane Smith reunion with the Doctor in ""School Reunion"", as well as a gorgeous period piece (one of the all-time best written episodes in my opinion) with ""The Girl in the Fireplace""  It has a fairytale-like quality with the way the Doctor appears in Madame de Pompadour's fireplace at critical moments in her life.  The Cybermen get to make their reappearance in a two-part ""Rise of the Cybermen""/""The Age of Steel"" story-their method of creating new Cybermen is one of the all-time great horrific moments of the series.  ""The Impossible Planet"" is a great high-concept story that is nicely book ended by ""The Satan Pit"" which brings you down from the concept (a lonely planet in a stationary orbit around a black hole) and into the pit (as it were) of a horror.  There is also one very offbeat episode, ""Love and Monsters"" that gives the Doctor and Rose the Rosencranz and Guildenstern treatment by moving them to the periphery of the story and focusing on the small-time character of Elton instead.  The monster is a hoot, especially when he and the Doctor finally meet.  It all comes crashing down magnificently with the Dalek-Cybermen throwdown season ending of ""Army of Ghosts""/""Doomsday"".  This is the episode the Freddy vs. Jason and Alien vs. Predator fans had been waiting for and every potential is lived up to here with some eye-popping CGI effects and a heart-wrenching farewell between the Doctor and Rose.  As a product, the overly priced (my one HUGE complaint) DVD set adequately satisfies also.  There are enough special features to almost equal out the episodes themselves.  The commentaries I heard (it's pretty hard to listen to watch an episode again all over) were pretty relaxed.  I dug the in-vision commentary . . . but don't explore this until you've actually seen and enjoyed the episode, because it's really distracting otherwise.  In all, this was probably the best 13 or so hours of sci-fi and storytelling that have been on television and DVD in a long while.  As for Season 3 . . .",1195344000,,2759,4.9094827586206895

2669154,4,B000JBWWP6,"I am another viewer who has been a long-time fan of the original show.  When I first heard about the new series a few years ago, I was unsure. In fact, I was sure that I was going to hate it.  After all, I'd hated the TV movie and I knew that nothing new could ever live up to the best of the original series.  (Though of course, rotting pond scum would be an improvement on the WORST of the original series.) Then I caught the first episode of the new series -- and shocked myself by loving it. Enough to immediately buy the region2 DVDs, which were the only ones available at the time.  (Which were then replaced by region1 as soon as THEY became available. It didn't feel quite like ""Dr. Who"", but it was entertaining nonetheless, with good acting and good production values.

Now, onto series 2.  I haven't seen all of it yet. (Disc 2 of my set was defective, so until the nice folks at Amazon send me my replacment set, I have to miss out on Sarah Jane's return.)  And ... I like it ... The worst stories (""New Earth"") are a bit better than rotting pond scum, and the best come very close to the best of the original.

But

Yes, it's a new series.  Yes, it's wonderful that it has the budget to do things with a thousand times more flash than the original.  But flash can't replace heart, and there IS a definite lack of heart.  And the sexual tension between Rose and the Doctor (which is much stronger in the second series than the first, if only because Tennant is so much younger and classically hearts-throb gorgeous than his predecessor) is a poor replacement for the more fatherly love and concern that we saw in the original.  Yes, any one of the doctors would have sacrificed his life for any one of his companions. Sexual love is not required for that sort of emotional attachment. Tennent also seems to never quite convince that he's an alien -- a non-human character with exeptional intelligence, but with real characer flaws.  He seems to teeter between utterly human and utterly god.
On the positive side, the 2nd series gets points for making at least an effort to remember its roots.  Too often the Doctor, and indeed the series (think console room) seems to completely forget that it had an existance before Rose appeared.  But here we see real Daleks and Cybermen. The Doctor mentions, however briefly,  previous planets and previous adventures.  And my daughter and I had a blast ticking off all the similirities between the alternate universe Cyberman story here (forget the title), and Troughton's ""Invasion.""
Now, if they could just remember that they're supposed to be telling compelling stories rather than demonstrating their ability to generate fantastic CG characters, they'll REALLY have something worth watching.",1193702400,,2746,4.6384297520661155

The only thing I found to be ""off"" was the doctor's flirtyness (which seemed like more than just flirting, really) with other women (in both seasons) while seeming committed to his partner.  It's just an odd thing to throw in when both seasons are actually quite romantic.  Perhaps the writers think that they can keep more viewers that way?

2669184,5,B000JBWWP6,"How do you improve on the near perfection of the reborn ""Doctor Who"" starring Christopher Eccleston? Quite easily, when you have stories like ""School Reunion,"" ""The Girl in the Fireplace,"" ""The Impossible Planet,"" and ""The Satan Pit,"" to name just a few, but... I'm getting ahead of myself here!

For those of us of a ""certain age,"" as we say in England - that's the wrong side of 40! LOL! - and remember the origins of the series waaaaaaaaay back in the 60's, then spent the subsequent decades suffering through more cardboard sets and rubber monsters than you could shake a stick at - the Daleks being honorable exceptions of course! - the rebirth of the venerable Doctor in 2005 was a revelation.

The stories had been tightened-up considerably - no running up and down endless corridor filler here! - the budget for a single episode appeared to be more than was spent on an entire series from the good-old-days, the production values/sfx were stellar, the writing tight and dramatic, bringing the Doctor and his Companion thoroughly up-to-date without losing the essence of the original. In Chris Eccleston they had, at last, a genuine, heavyweight Thesp playing the Doctor, an actor who could not only handle the edgier, more grown-up aspects of the new stories, but could also inject an element of the manic/slightly unhinged into his performance, similar to the much-loved Tom Baker. And any worries that Billie Piper would not be up to the job, dramatically, were soon laid to rest... and how!!!

To say that us fans were spoiled by the 2005 series was putting it mildly, then as the season climaxed with the superlative ""Bad Wolf"" and ""Parting of the Ways,"" we were all thrown for a loop when given a ""regeneration scene"" and a NEW Doctor! What were the BBC thinking about, were they crazy?!?!?! The short answer is ""No,"" the casting of David Tennant was every bit as inspired as his predecessor; he actually managed to up the manic-quotient without going completely bonkers, and brought a kind of geeky coolness to the character we hadn't seen before!

And then there was ""Rose;"" oh my goodness, in all it's years, there has NEVER been a companion for the Doctor like Rose Tyler. Unlike practically all previous companions, Rose is a character in her own right, with her own back story, fully realized, she is, dramatically at least, the Doctor's equal. Her development, from London shop-girl, to time traveler, explorer of the universe, and killer of Daleks, helps drive the stories in a new, more emotionally fulfilling direction.

After the roller coaster ride of Season 1 with it's ""Bad Wolf"" story arc, Season 2 scaled things back ever so slightly, but invested even more time and effort in exploring the relationship between the unearthly Doctor, and the all-too-human Rose. This is tackled head-on in the 4th episode, ""School Reunion,"" which goes some way to answering the question of what happens to the companions after they have stopped travelling with the Time Lord; a stand-out episode, it re-introduces Elizabeth Sladen's ""Sarah Jane Smith."" I don't want to say too much about any particular episode for those who haven't seen the series yet, but the scene where Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS and its owner made the hair on the back of my neck stand up! Later in the episode there's an affecting scene between the Doctor and Rose as he tries to explain to her why he can't allow himself to become emotionally involved with his Human companions... he's practically immortal, we're not.

The next episode, ""The girl in the fireplace,"" perfectly illustrates the preceding point, when the Doctor allows himself to become attached to Madame de Pompadour, whilst simultaneously battling clockwork androids on a derelict starship in the far future! ""Rise of the Cybermen"" and ""Age of Steel"" successfully reinvents one of the Doctors most popular adversaries, whilst ""The impossible planet"" and ""The Satan pit"" set-up some very Alien-esque chills in a wonderful two-parter.

The series ends, just as did Season 1, with another amazing two-part story, ""Army of Ghosts"" and the aptly titled ""Doomsday,"" which sees the Daleks fighting it out with the new-and-improved Cybermen for control of planet Earth; to steal a line from the totally execrable AvP, ""Whoever wins, we lose!"" LOL! It's difficult to know which fate would be worse, having the whole planet ""upgraded"" by the Cybermen, or flayed and filleted through the Daleks genetic labs to help create an even bigger and more murderous Dalek army!!! This is a superb story to end the season, but be warned, the finale is... emotional!

There's a nice recurring theme in the series concerning the ""Torchwood Institute,"" which becomes central to the final two episodes, and if this set is the first you've seen of Season 2, DO make sure you watch the ""Children in Need"" episode in the ""Special Features"" section of the set FIRST. It acts as a coda to Season 1, as well as a prologue to Season 2, and explains the somewhat crazed materialization of the TARDIS, as well as the Doctor himself, in the rollicking first episode, ""The Christmas Invasion.""

Any worries I had that the quality of the first season could not be maintained were unfounded... if you enjoyed Season 1, grab Season 2 immediately, you won't regret it!",1186790400,,5286,4.917040358744394

2669189,2,B000JBWWP6,"I found this series almost painful to watch at times. Dr Who was always great ""cheesy"" fun, but this new version takes itself far too seriously at times - making the cheese-factor something you laugh AT, rather than laugh along with. There are far too many episodes in London (it feels like a council promo at times...) and some of the supporting characters are hugely annoying - especially Mickey, who often had me cheering for the bad guys in the hope that the annoying little so-and-so would get killed in some hilarious (and preferably gory) fashion.
On the plus side; David Tennant is perfect as the Doctor, and Billie Piper is also fantastic as the down-to-earth and likable sidekick - they have a great chemistry. Some of the visuals are excellent, and occasionally it does actually hit the mark when trying to be poignant.

2669241,1,B000JBWWP6,"I agree with the other 2 one star reviewers - why bother? This is some of the worst television I have ever seen. I love old Doctor Who up to somewhere towards the end of Tom Baker - then it gets patchy and is only sporadically worthwhile. This new series is Doctor Who in name only - when compared with the old stuff this is a good demonstration of our culture going to seed.
The format has changed completely - admittedly this second series Tennant is much better than CE, but neither of them are 'Doctor-like' at all in my opinion. The new BBC production is glossy and looks kind of impressive but it fails to hide the lack of heart beneath. Everything is sensationalised and overly dramatic - the writing is terrible, the characters particularly annoying and the Doctor, although historically sometimes playing the fool, here adds to the role a cocksure arrogance which somehow doesn't feel right anymore.
In fact, this new Doctor Who is an apt metaphor for the once Great Britain going to seed in modern times. Slappers, whingers, louts and bullies make up the characters and there is so much pulling of the heart-strings that it all snaps pretty quickly. The new 'action' emphasis represents a dumbing down of the format into a more modern American feel but 90s Star Trek was so much better than this.
It shows how lacking in imagination the BBC is that it had to drag the Doctor kicking, screaming and whinging back into the 21st century to a treatment and postmodern environment that doesn't suit at all. They really should be ashamed of themselves but they wouldn't have the good sense to be I guess.
It is obvious I am out of step with popular opinion - you'll find lots of people who loved the new Star Wars films too - but I reckon if you genuinely enjoy this stuff then that's pretty sad.
This is empty, flashy rubbish that recycles old ideas into an ill-fitting new format designed to suit the audience of today with 10-second attention spans and a need for explicit romantic content and soppy emotional rubbish entirely lacking in credibility or sincerity.
It's not that I think they should have remade it trying to keep it as it was, they just should have let it RIP and come up with a new idea - obviously too hard for the masterminds running BBC these days.
(On a similar theme - the decline of the British persona is shown up in a series of embarrassing interviews done by some young git for the Fawlty Towers boxset. Check out the one with Prunella Scales - I felt sorry for her having to tolerate the fool.)
OK - tell me how unhelpful it is to post a different opinion here rather than the normal, gushing 5-star rave and the sycophantic Amazon official review - I'm waiting.....",1182124800,,2699,4.544147843942505

2669243,5,B000JBWWP6,I've been a Dr. Who fan since Tom Baker days.  These episodes are the best ever.  A great buy - one that shouldn't be passed up.,1181174400,,128,3.8846153846153846
2669244,2,B000JBWWP6,"A simple question.

All writing should really be critiqued by modern script editors and writers, even producers, by five basic questions - Who? Where? What? How? Why?  Sadly these very basic questions aren't brought into play when shows like this are made.  Much of modern television writing is very sad, but the efforts tend to survive via hungry, lethargic audiences in need of escapism that find delight in sexual content, glossy effects, and kitschy but vapid symbolism/content.  All story based entertainment has to have strong story to be excellent, and this is really, really, really awful scripting.

That being said, I do want to say that Tennant is probably the best Doctor since Tom Baker, and if he can refine the character a little and cut out some of the hectoring speech and slobbering he might be the television character of the decade.  The production values of the new series (aside from writing) are brilliant!  But many of the actors can't shine because the scripting is so limited and flabby to center on glitz rather then character - a shame since so many British actors are brilliant at making greater then life, enigmatic and memorable performances when given good script and direction.

Davies seems to have a penchant for the hilarity that is putting the 'Doctor' in HOSPITALS.  Har har, such a great joke, especially to kick off a new Doctor.  90% of the season deteriorates into logicless monsters and motives.  Awful denouement tends to involve the Davies signature Machina-Ex-Dues with a super magic wand sonic screwdriver.  Cop outs galore!  And if that isn;t enough, you get a surprise oral sex gag for the kiddies, and a slew of black tie parties, east enders, and sappy sexual situations that take the place of the base instinct of survival and greed that made the series able to continue through the decades.  If writing reflects a writer, then the writer(s) basically portray that they are all about sex, parties, hooking up, sappy sentimentality, and random political struggles within corporations.  Nice.

The shining star of this season, standing head, shoulders, chest, abdomen, groin and thighs above the surrounding efforts in 'Girl In The Fireplace' written by Steven Moffat (creator/writer of the brilliant COUPLING sitcom).  While this is a story of twisted survival it is also about emotional love and devotion; an unusual Doctor Who aspect unexplored until now, especially swamped in lusts the rest of the season.  The Doctor becomes an enigmatic and valiant 'prince' that unexpectedly (but extremely well written) creates devotion in an unusual 'princess'.  But then the logic of the story goes to hell in the denouement as it becomes another silly 'doctor rants at lethal enemy that stands there and takes it on the chin while standing still as a statue' moment common in this season.  That is vindicated by the final twist revealing the motive of the story.

The ""New Adventures of Doctor Who : EastEnders Lost In Space"" is a grab bag.  If you are a kid who needs a new shiny with some lust and casual love thrown in - it's perfect.  if you are an intelligent viewer who wants great story, perhaps something to reaffirm life's glory and myriad wonders.... walk on by, or sob like a little girl over the money wasted on ephemeral garbage.  Personally i found this season, and almost all new Who stories, rather intellectually insulting and simplistic.

If only the crew asked - WHY? - from the start.  They would have found they did it for the money and fame, and just written shows about money and fame. And we would have at least had stories that honestly expressed their souls, rather then a combo of fan pandering images and situations strung together with screeching, simplistic dialogue.",1179964800,,3742,4.92822966507177

The old Doctor Who of the 1960s and '70 may have had cheesy sets and lousy acting, BUT THE STORIES WERE GOOD!

I would have utterly embarassed, if I were BBC, to put that show on the air.  This teary, sappy, emotional stuff just doesn't work, it's not Doctor Who.  And why so many episodes on earth?  That's not Doctor Who, either.  This guy travels, his Tardis takes him where he doesn't know where, not to London in different time periods.

2669289,5,B000JBWWP6,"From the beginning of the slam bang Christmas Invasion, it was clear that the Tenth Doctor, played by Scottish actor David Tennant, would be marvelous. His geek chic, enthusiasm, and warmth capably took what Eccleston had established as the Ninth Doctor and ran with it.

All thirteen of the regular season episodes are well written and well acted, with each adding something to the series canon.

Here is brief information about each (There may be slight spoilers, but I haven't revealed endings):

1. New Earth: Rose and the Doctor visit the fifteenth incarnation of the city of New York, and Rose gets to know and trust the newly regenerated Doctor. The prosthetics are amazing.

2. Tooth and Claw: Classic historical episode. The Doctor and Rose meet Queen Victoria and see the Kohi Nor. Also, David Tennant has an opportunity to use his natural Scottish accent.

3. School Reunion: Rose's on-and-off boyfriend, Mickey, alerts her and the Doctor to some odd things happening at a present-day British school. The Doctor and Rose go undercover, and K-9 and Sarah Jane Smith make an emotionally charged return to the show.

4. The Girl in the Fireplace: My favorite episode of the season finds Mickey, the Doctor, and Rose on a futuristic spaceship that contains the past-literally, the life of Madame de Pompadour. The Doctor dances again and gets emotionally involved far more than he usually allows himself to be.

5.-6. Rise of the Cybermen/Age of Steel: Mickey, Rose, and the Doctor accidentally land in a parallel universe in which Rose's father is alive and a scientist is trying to change humanity into immortal and non-feeling cybermen. Chaos ensues, and the Doctor is forced to make tough choices in order to save the day.

7. The Idiot's Lantern: A nice change of pace finds Rose and the Doctor in London before the coronation of Elizabeth I, where a mysterous force is stealing people's essence. The Doctor has fun riding around on a motor scooter, and it's obvious his attachment to Rose is growing.

8.-9. The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit: Dramatic two-parter in which Rose and the Doctor are trapped with a group of human researchers in outer space. The Ood make an appearance, as does Satan.

10. Love & Monsters: Possibly the least popular of this season's stories. The Doctor is seen through the eyes of a group of friends who track his activities. The villain in the episode was created by a fan who won a contest.

11. Fear Her: People are disappearing in the year 2012. The Doctor and Rose have to discover how without disappearing themselves. This episide is like the calm before the storm. The Doctor has premonitions, and Rose just hopes things will go on forever as they are.

12. Army of Ghosts: The first of the final two-parter, but it stands in its own right. Rose and the Doctor return home to Jackie, only to find that people everywhere are used to seeing the ghosts of their dead loved ones appear regularly. In their quest to find out why, Rose and the Doctor end up in Torchwood, where mayhem ensues.

13. Doomsday: Season finale. Two of the Doctor's bitter enemies return, and the Doctor confronts one of the hardest decisions he has ever made. A beautiful, heart-wrenching episode.

It's not only David Tennant who does a good job here. Billie Piper, Noel Clark, and the other supporting castmembers turn in believable and sometimes brilliant performances.

Season 1 of the new series was a jumping-off point. It's safe to say that with Season 2's caliber of writing, acting, and effects, Doctor Who has a glowing future ahead.

2669292,5,B000JBWWP6,"I've actually had this set in my collection since last November. I'm not sure what happened to my original review.

I was always leery of the new Doctor, having got so comfortable with the previous one whoever that may have been.

Chris Eccleston's Doctor was a real triumph and his pairing with Billie Piper was nothing short of inspired. The stories were great, taking not only the series to new heights but TV sci-fi also, so his departure after one season was truly brave, for where was that going to leave the show?

In the hands of a very talented individual by the name of David Tennant, that's where. His Doctor explores humanity like never before and it's not since The Green Death that we see him so openly attached to his companion. Their separation was a miserable experience for me and, damn, did I want him to tell Rose his feelings for her. She knew it, he knew it, we all knew it but just say it!

The stories are of a consistently high standard and some of the Doctor's lines are pure magic (""I may die but the moral high ground is mine""!) This show has not only hit its stride but come of age. This is intelligent sci-fi, thoroughly enjoyable, gripping, witty and produced by people who care.

The downside is that my set comes with a natty little Cyberman head stuck on the front (I couldn't wait for the US release!). Just like the first box, which I also got from Amazon UK, this won't go many rounds. I took the first set out of the box and put them in separate cases to avoid unnecessary wear and tear. Perhaps I should do this again.

This is a minor quibble, I suppose.

The point is that the BBC has produced world-class television. That this television is my favourite ever show is a very good thing.

Enjoy the show, one episode after another. Tennant's Doctor rocks.",1175644800,,1795,4.434650455927052

2669338,4,B000JBWWP6,"My husband could barely contain himself when he found out that his much beloved Dr. Who was coming back to town on the Sci-fi channel back in 2005. I have to admit that I was a bit excited myself. Here was a chance to get reaquainted with the a little British sci-fi export about this painfully British looking guy (Tom Baker, of course) with this forever long scarf loping about among cheap ""hi-tech"" sets with this much younger British chick. I had only seen a couple of episodes as a very young child and found that it merely creeped me out (I believe it was Robots of Death), but I remembered enough to relate when people mentioned the show, or when I would hear the theme music. So, here I am at 33 years-old ready to wipe the Dr. Who slate clean and begin things all anew for my husband's enjoyment, if anything.

The new series has been alot of fun. Hearing the theme music again, even to a non-fan is nostalgic enough to bring tears to the eye.  The effects and studio sets look great, the stories exciting and clever.  Both doctors have been fun loving and just chock-full of all things a sci-fi fan could possibly want, and proving once again that one doesn't have to be a ""kill em all and let God sort em out"" kind of hero to save the day in Whoville.  So, I give this series a nice, healthy rating. Room for it to shoot for perfection, not that it has far to go.  That being said. . .

After watching ""School Reunion"" with Elizabeth Sladen reprising her role as Sarah Jane Smith with faithful computer dog K-9, it made me wonder about the whole Dr. Who phenomenon in general.  My husband filled me in on the fact that this show had been on for 26 consecutive years from 1963-1989 and that there had been more doctors before and after scarf dude. So, out of curiosity, I started dabbling into classic Dr. Who mostly from the 70's being that this period more coinsides with the little I remember about the show, and the fact that more dvds are available from this era.  Since then I've seen the light.

True, the effects and sets are still pretty poor, and the creatures costumes rather embarrassing, the scripts a bit forced, but it does accomplish one very important aspect of Dr. Who.  It lasted out 26 years through the blood, sweat, and tears of those men and women in front and behind the camera.  There were no computer artists to type in a program to bring all those monsters closer to life.  Many scripts were written up in a week's time or less.  The filming was fast and furious, often requiring the actors to get it right the first time, because studio time was a precious and expensive commodity.  All this to fill up a half hour every Saturday for British kids, and somehow, it still became a worldwide obsession.

Okay, enough of the soap-box talk and on to personal opinions of these new doctors.  Now, mind you, I like these guys, just as I mentioned before, and if these were the absolute first to play the role, it would be a no-brainer to say that they are dead-on.  But they aren't the absolute firsts and in some ways there is a lot to be desired.  They do a great job taking on bits and pieces of the doctors they generated from, but I find Eccleston's heavy northern accent rather jolting.  He reminds me of Drax from the Armaggedan Factor episode from 1978 with that accent, and I'd rather not be reminded of Drax manifesting in any doctor regeneration! And as for little David Tennant, well, I referred to him as a little, oily rat in another review, but only because I had only seen him in his role in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and he did such a great job as a little, oily rat man (other than wormtail, of course)!  He's also rather too young looking to play this 900 year-old Timelord. At his age he has to be careful not to come off a some arrogant, know-it-all brat.  And as for companion Rose and all her baggage (I mean 'family'), I don't recall Tom Baker's doctor ever caring whether he had a companion or not. He most certainly never begged them to come along, they were sort of always dumped on him to haul around.

These are personal opinions, of course, and if northern British accents and kid looking timelords are your cup of tea, hey, this new series is perfection already. But if you can't help but long for the Bohemian dressed, scarf wearin', alien charm of Tom Baker loping about those cheap, built from scratch sets, ad-libbing Oscar Wilde style in his smooth baratone voice, then slap 4 stars on this series and remember to be eternally grateful that it brought you back to tried and true, bare knuckle Who.",1174176000,,4574,4.407363420427553

2669357,4,B000JBWWP6,"I was thrilled when the new Dr Who series came to the USA.  Christopher Eccelston's characterization of the Doctor during the first season was more than I could have hoped for.

So I was very disappointed when he chose not to do a second series.  Then when I heard that ""Barty Crouch Jr"" from Harry Potter was stepping into the role well I was resigned to never watching the good Doctor again.

To say that I was surprised with how much I liked Tennant's take on the Doctor would be an understatement.  He brings his own brand of quirky joie d vivre to the role that both fits and is different from Eccelston's Doctor

His characterization has a harder edge - he is willing to take a bit more violent stand and he is willing to let his feelings for Rose show a bit more

The end of the second series really points out the tragedy of being the Doctor (immortality is not all it is cracked up to be). I am glad Tennant is coming back for season 3.  It will be very interesting to see what new characters pop up since several from last season have gone on to have spin off shows in the UK.

If you are a old time Dr Who fan, like British TV, or are in to sci fi, you will enjoy this new incarnation of the old favorite.",1173398400,,1216,4.11864406779661

2669359,5,B000JBWWP6,"The first season the first doctor was amazing. I am a huge Tom Baker fan and in my eyes there could never be another Doctor as good as him. I was very skeptical of this new Doctor Who series. After watching the first season I was amazed how great the plots were and how amazing this doctor was. Shockingly they replaced this doctor with a new one at the end of the first series. I could not believe this. Personally I was shocked they found an actor this good to play Doctor Who. Now they get rid of him and replace him with a new actor. My thought, the show is over, they will never find another person to play the doctor as well as this first guy.

To my amazement this new guy is unbelieveable as the doctor. He is even better then the first and reminds me a lot of Tom Baker. The second season is great all the way through until the end. Billie Pipper I love. She is great as the doctors side kick and not to leave out she is HOT!! Just after two season they are now getting rid of her. Did the first Doctor and Billie Pipper choose to leave on there own or were they fired. If they left on there own they were fools cause this new series is great and should be picked up for many seasons to come. I am in fear of this new side kick who will be appearing in season three.

2669361,5,B000JBWWP6,"The return of Dr. Who is the most exciting thing that has happened to Science Fiction TV since Star Trek The Next Generation premiered-- and much less disappointing. David Tennant is a funny, versatile, sexy doctor. Although I miss the edginess of Christopher Eccleston, Tennant is terrific-- immediately likable. He's like a Doctor with ADD, sometimes almost manic in his characterization, sometimes sad, very emotional, but always with a very firm set of internal guidelines and invincibility. This doctor has accepted who he is, has come to terms with the life of a Time Lord, and more than anything lets you see how alien he really is.

This season has some of the saddest episodes I can recall- three real tear jerkers, and for the first time we actually get to see the Doctor in a potentially romantic capacity. I love his delight in exploring the universe-- when confronted with a huge, menacing werewolf his first reaction is, ""Beautiful!"" Billie Piper as Rose is a good counterpart to this as they both frequently get caught up in the fun of traveling-- yes they are facing horrible villains and having to save the world on an episodic basis but they are also just plain HAVING FUN.

It is a delight to see Elizabeth Sladen back as Sarah Jane Smith and also to see K-9 back. Although I wasn't completely happy with the bitter portrayal of Sarah Jane, I can see what the writers were doing and can see that it made sense in light of the story.

I DO wish the series hadn't spent so much time with Rose's family. More than half of the episodes centered on Rose, her mother, her father and Mickey and it was, frankly, tiresome. Companions are not supposed to have baggage! I realize that the writers were trying to explore this aspect of the show because it had never really been done before however that's always been part of the charm of Dr. Who-- the thought that he can pick up a companion, take them out of time and space with no thoughts for whomever they might leave behind.

My fears were laid to rest in the first five minutes of the Christmas episode and by the end of that episode I was totally in love with David Tennant. He made the Doctor his own while keeping the essence of the character. And Billie Piper? Well, I saw her first pop video when she first hit the music scene in England as a teenager. She has transformed herself into a very good actress. She's perky without being irritating and crys REAL tears. You gotta love the girl who makes the Doctor smile. Piper plays equally as well with Tennant as she did with Christopher Eccleston. I will miss her is season 3 so all the more reason to relish the DVD sets. Season 2 is gripping, exciting, touching, funny, suspenseful, emotional, and simply bloody FANTASTIC! I still cry during the final 2 episodes. Favorite episode is ""Tooth and Claw"". This episode is not only creepy with its warrior monks and werewolf but sets up Torchwood as season two's ""hint"" game. Watch all the episodes again and follow the trail of Torchwood.

David Tennant plays a great doctor who, but about all of the stories in this season are set on Earth.  Forward in time, backwards in time, current time in an alternate universe, but on Earth.  I don't know if this is because they blew their budget on the first season, but most of the episodes are pretty sappy (especially the later episodes).  Since most of the episodes focus on Rose, they have a Scrappy Doo quality to them that makes them all a bit silly.

I really want to enjoy this series, and I'll tune in for season three, but if it keeps going its current direction, it will soon be airing as some kind of after school special called ""Rose Who?"".",1171152000,,762,4.263888888888889
2669522,5,B000JBWWP6,"This series has come a long way since the it debuted in the early sixties. Who could've known it'd still keep going strong, fresh and vigorous into the 21st century? It alsmost didn't. Not until a wonderful man by the name Russell T. Davies took the helm of the new project and infused it with all the wonder, wit and flamboyant eccentricity of the early series. Series 1 of the new Doctor Who showed that the series could keep its essence and original storytelling without being overwhelmed by modern special effects - which were sorely need, though. It also cast some wonderful characters to carry the torth. Christopher Eccleston's Doctor will go down in the annals of Who history as the ""Golden Age"" of of the new Doctor Who. When he left at the end of series 1, David Tennant, who took on the role had some pretty big clogs to fill. Fortunately, Tennant's Doctor is as energetic and powerful as Eccleston's while remaining very different. His Doctor seems reminiscent of the olde Tom Baker era, and the stories his character gets into often exude the horrors of the Patrick Troughton early years. Doctor who was always best when it was scary, something the orginal series seemed to drop towards the end in favor of telling stories that were just ""weird"". Fortunately the new series knows how to exploit its deeper roots and brings some incredibly hair-raising moments. Werewolves, Cybermen, and TV's that suck people's faces off. Also, the stories are well written, not just resting a cruch of cheap thrills. Each story seems to have something intelligent and moving to say, something that separates Doctor Who from being just a ""Kid's show"" to something everyone can enjoy. I, for one, was strangely attractd to what is probably the most bizarre episode of series 2 (nay, the whole series), ""Love and Monsters"". Although not told from the Doctor or Rose's perspective, the intrigue, emotion and charismatic branding of the series are all packaged neatly into it. It's as bizzare as it is moving. But I won't dare spoil it for any of you because it is an epidode, I believe, that is meant to surprise you becuase of its ""uniqueness"".

Overall, series 2 has done a fanastic job of opening the world of Who to old and young alike. For me, someone who comes from the fandom of the classic series, I feel like I'm rediscovering my love of the show without having to relearn it. For my friends, who scarcely glanced at the old series, its ageless fun and intellegence (not to mention updated special effects) have drawn them in as well.

Season One revived the show with a bigger budget, better effects, superb writing, and a charismatic new Doctor in Chirstopher Eccleston. Season Two's new Doctor, David Tennant, blends beautifully with the supporting cast while bringing his own classically quirky stamp to the character. Less childlike than Eccleston, Tennat's Doctor gets a little more time for romance, even with sidekick Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). But he still does his share of fighting evil, aliens, and evil aliens. This year sees him take on a werewolf, Cybermen, Daleks, Satan (yes, that Satan), and Torchwood- England's answer to Ares 51.

The six-DVD set includes the Christmas episode and the ""Children In Need"" short that ran between seasons in England, as well as outtakes, deleted scenes, and an entire disc of the min-documentary series Doctor Who Confidential, which was shown only in the UK until now.

2669541,5,B000JBWWP6,"When Doctor Who returned to our screens in 2005, even for the disinterested, it was probably THE British TV event of the year. For the die hard fans, it was a dream come true. Finally the BBC was giving it the profile, the budget, the schedule and the kudos that they felt it had always deserved. Russell T. Davis had reinvented a classic TV icon and made it even more exciting than ever and Christopher Eccleston brought a new edge to the world's longest running sci-fi TV hero.

But before the first season had even run its course, Eccleston was gone. Never explaining why, after the huge relaunch, the BBC were already having to recast the role, running the risk of losing everything they'd built up in such a short space of time. Thankfully, (unlike so many times in the 1980's) the production team made a truly inspired decision to cast David Tennant in the role of the Doctor and keep the new found dynamism on track.

Here is the complete first season of Tennant's stint as the Time Lord from Gallifrey, which I personally hope will be the first of many. He really has taken the role to heart and developed a truly engaging and charismatic Doctor - one that's on a par with the great Tom Baker for sure and outdoing many others who've taken the role in the past. All 14 episodes are included, starting with the hour-long 2005 Christmas special, followed by the 13 45-minute episodes from the spring of 2006.

There are many fans of course who aren't particularly enamored of the new approach to their favorite time traveler. It is fair to say that the whole concept has become rather `soapy'. It's certainly no stretch to see that Eastenders seems to have a big influence over the style of the new direction. Whereas it brings an edge of reality to the series to flesh out the lives and emotions of the Doctor and his companions, it has to be said that in this particular season, that emotion is being somewhat overplayed. Sarah-Jane Smith is back at the Doctor's side in `School Reunion' after having been dumped from the TARDIS back in 1976. It's great to see Elisabeth Sladen back on form, but from a continuity point, it's not really true to the original series. Sarah-Jane did already meet up with the Doctor again, back in the 1983 20th anniversary special, The Five Doctors, and the hurt and despair explored now ignores that particular narrative completely. Every episode seems to have some emotional turmoil between the Doctor's current companion, Rose, and the Time Lord himself, which seems to always be edging them towards at least a romantic relationship, if not a full-blown sexual one. After a while, it seems this sub-text is always getting in the way of the main narrative of each story. Even the long awaited and definitely overdue clash between the Doctor's two most famous enemies, The Daleks and The Cybermen, is eventually pushed into the background to develop more of the Doctor/Rose relationship. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just overplayed. I for one would like to see less of Rose's emotions and those of her family and hopefully in the 2007 season, new characters will be handled differently.

There are fewer extras than were included on the Eccleston season release, possibly to accommodate the extra episode. The short interim piece shown on the BBC's Children in Need charity telethon is included and there's a commentary for each story, often with on-screen visuals. A sixth disc includes the accompanying Doctor Who Confidential, behind the scenes documentaries, but there's little else. It's still a great package nonetheless.

I hope the rumors of David Tennant's departure during the 2008 season are false. He's such a great Doctor; it would be a shame to lose him. But so far, most of the rumors about the series that have done the rounds have all pretty much turned out to be true. Still, they moved effortlessly from Eccleston to Tennant, so presumably they can do the same again. In the meantime, here's some wonderful Doctor Who to enjoy again.",1170201600,,4003,4.762247838616715
2669542,5,B000JBWWP6,"Fear this DVD set, at least if you are pressed for time. A season full of thoroughly entertaining, enjoyable science fiction TV episodes straight from the UK are to be found within, and the temptation to put the next disc in and keep watching is terribly hard to resist.

David Tennant certainly had some pretty big shoes to fill (nine pairs of them, actually), but he has really done a wonderful job in taking on the role of the eccentric space/time-wandering Doctor. He's as delightfully quirky as ever, yet in a more hyperactive manner. Full of frenetic humor and yet less distant emotionally, with more warmth and less sarcasm than his immediate predecessor. This makes him a bit more likeable but also a bit too human perhaps; it's easier to forget that he's not of this earth, although traces of #9's convincingly alien mean streak remain. And his oddball sense of wonder in the face of the unknown--even werewolves have a certain ""beauty"" for him. In general, Tennant's Doctor will prove to be a memorable one, I suspect, faithfully true to the character's general persona while engagingly eccentric in its own very unique way.

The storytelling has thankfully improved very much since the prior season. Don't get me wrong, I liked ""The Complete First Series"" quite a bit, but this second time around the plotlines seem less rushed and the solutions less sudden and out of left field. More of the stories are two-parters, which helps immensely in this regard. After all, the good old classic ""Doctor Who"" tales gradually developed through four episodes of about half an hour each; two hour-long episodes back-to-back amounts to much the same thing, which may be about the ideal time necessary for a Doctor Who plot to unfold. This season has a good mix of stories too. Many are good solid straight science fiction, and this is especially so of ""Rise of the Cybermen"" (okay, even if the Cybermen's inventor does seem like a carbon copy of Davros), and along the same lines the Doomsday battle between two classic Doctor Who foes in the season finale is totally and utterly inspired! I've dreamed of such a confrontation ever since I was a nerdy teenager watching this show religiously on PBS. More characteristic perhaps of the season as a whole though are stories that straddle the boundary between sci-fi and horror in intriguing ways, including a face-off with the devil himself. Sounds corny, but it's actually pulled off well, downright scary but with just the right dose of agnostic ambiguity.

Not every episode is a masterpiece, of course. The masterpieces wouldn't stand out then. And everyone will have their favorites. But overall this is a fine year's worth of an excellent show in its latest incarnation, the New New New New New New New New New New Doctor Who.",1169856000,,2779,4.846315789473684

To think that in 7th grade oh so many years ago I used to run home from school to see Jon Pertwee play the Doctor in his first visit to US Television, and that I have loved him and the series ever since.

To see the characters and the stories finally get the production values they deserve, to compliment the always wonderful writing, is a joy to behold. THE LADY IN THE FIREPLACE is, I think, one of the best Doctor's ever, and the return of Lady Cassandra...well, what can you say?

2669544,5,B000JBWWP6,"I think I prefer this latest Doctor to the previous one and this series is better written and the stories more engrossing. I thought'School Reunion' beautifully acted by David Tennent and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith. I remember watching her the first time round and it was both touching and very sad to see how the after affects of travelling with the Doctor effected her..

  The story 'the girl in the firplace' was also well written and acted. It also made me cry.

 Doctor has to have at least 1 scary story and 'the tooth and the claw' filled that criteria.

  By the end of the series though I was tired of Rose. She was loud  and brash and frankly too immature for the Doctor's interest to be crediable. The finale was well written but I was quite numb to Rose's pain as she ended most of the episodes in tears and I was rather glad to see her go.",1169510400,,863,4.3105590062111805

2669547,5,B000JBWWP6,What can I say that has not been said about this wonderful series. Growing up in the late 70's and 80's some of my best memories was watching this show on PBS. I loved all the crazy aliens and cheesy effects and most of all the awesome theme song. Now the Doctor is back and the show is better than ever. I liked CE's Doctor but DT's is amazing and he hits the character right on the head. The effects are still a bit cheesy but thats what makes the show timeless and great. The writing on the show is some of the best in TV history and the supporting cast is wonderful as well. I can't wait for Season 3! Best Episode in my opinion is the Girl in the Fireplace.,1169337600,,662,4.0227272727272725

He's more believable than his predecessor, and his portrayal of our favourite Time Lord is the best I've seen in quite some time. Series 2 has preserved the spirit of classic DW while taking a bold step into the future (no pun intended), and

story arcs like 'Rise of the Cybermen'/'Age of Steel' and the season finale will not disappoint.

2669560,5,B000JBWWP6,"One of the best things that the BBC has ever done was to bring back the long-lived sci-fi show called ""Doctor Who"" in 2005.  After a very successful first season in 2005, the tenth Doctor (David Tennant, who many will recognize as the actor who played the character Barty Crouch, Jr. in the 2005 film ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"") with his human companions Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) once again travel through time and space in the Doctor's mysterious time/spaceship called the TARDIS.

The fifteen episodes included in this DVD set are as follows:

1. ""The Christmas Invasion"".  With the tenth doctor lying in Rose's home in a coma, can anyone stop the invasion of the aliens known as the Sycorax?  (Rose's mother Jackie played by Camille Coduri.)

2. ""New Earth"".  The Doctor, Rose & Mickey discover a bizarre hospital where the nurses are cat people.  They run into someone familiar: Cassandra.

3. ""Tooth and Claw"".  Traveling to 19th-century Scotland, the Doctor, Rose & Mickey meet Queen Victoria (Pauline Collins), who is being hunted by strange men and a werewolf.

4. ""School Reunion"".  The Doctor, Rose & Mickey battle aliens that are using human children as computers to crack a mysterious code, and they run into two of the Doctor's previous companions: K9 and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen, reprising her original role).

5. ""The Girl in the Fireplace"".  After traveling to the 51st century, the Doctor, Rose & Mickey find robots that are after an 18th century woman, Madame De Pompadour (Sophia Myles), for a diabolical plan! (A very emotional episode.)

6. ""Rise of the Cybermen"".  The Doctor, Rose & Mickey accidentally travel to an alternate universe and find an Earth where dirigibles are the norm and Rose's father Pete (Shaun Dingwall) is alive, not dead.  However, a powerful but dying businessman, John Lumic (Roger Lloyd-Pack, who played Barty Crouch, Sr. in the 2005 ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire""), wants to transform humans into Cybermen!

7. ""The Age of Steel"".  In the continuation of ""Rise of the Cybermen"", the Doctor, Rose & Mickey narrowly escape an assault by the Cybermen and work with people from the alternate universe to stop them.  One of the doctor's companions decide to stay behind.

8. ""The Idiot's Lantern"".  The Doctor & Rose return to the correct Earth to see Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, but people are mysteriously disappearing after obtaining an unusual TV set.

9. ""The Impossible Planet"".  The Doctor & Rose travel to a dark alien world with a mysterious pit and located near a black hole.

10. ""The Satan Pit"".  In the continuation of ""The Impossible Planet"", the beast in Satan's pit challenges the Doctor's core beliefs.

11. ""Love & Monsters"".  A group of people on Earth have been compiling information about the mysterious Doctor Who.

12. ""Fear Her"".  The Doctor & Rose travel to London for the 2012 Olympic games and discover that children have been mysteriously disappearing.

13. ""Army of Ghosts"".  As the world celebrates the ghosts of loved ones suddenly appearing, the Doctor & Rose find a new connection the alternate universe and once again find Mickey & Rose's father Pete; but one of the Doctor's deadliest enemies is going appear.

15. ""The Runaway Bride"".  A young bride is mysteriously transported to the TARDIS.

With impressive special effects, well-written & engaging stories and great acting, I rate ""Doctor Who: The Complete Second Series"" DVD set with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that loves sci-fi.",1168992000,,3765,4.9096671949286845
2669561,5,B000JBWWP6,"For those who have seen the second season of the ""new"" ""Doctor Who"" the big question will be is this worthwhile buying on DVD? Absolutely. Despite having a high sticker price, the set comes with commentary tracks (either InVision which is a video commentary with the video tucked into the right hand corner of the screen or audio commentary), David Tennant's video diaries (which run about 82 minutes all told), Billie Piper's video diaries as well as ""Doctor Who Confidential"" episodes (although supposedly these are shorter than the ones that ran. I can't comment on that since I never saw the original episodes of ""Doctor Who Confidential"" as it wasn't broadcast in the U.S.). We also get a booklet outlining which episodes have audio/video commentaries, an introduction by the producer and some behind-the-scenes photos on the last two pages of the booklet. The fifteen episodes included here are augmented by a special mini-episode produced for the British Children in Need telethon.

The show is housed like the previously season with discs overlapping on the inside and all of them in a cardboard fold out box with a linticular 3-D cover of the Tardis. A clear slipcase with Billie Piper and David Tennant slides over the set.

Fans should be aware that the flaw on disc one noted in the Netflix Edition of the show (where at 32 minutes into the ""New Earth"" episode the DVD shifts from the first layer to the second layer of the disc and shows the last half of ""The Texas Chainsaw Masacre: The Beginning"")doesn't appear to effect the ones for sale (so far there haven't been any complaints and the edition I got was just fine).

The ""Children in Need"" mini-episode should probably be watched before the first episode of the second season as a special feature (I would have put it as an episode you could select separately from the first episode of season two) but other than that BBC and Warner have done a fine job with the set. The problem with the oddly mixed audio of the first season second doesn't effect the second at all.

For more details and info about this season read below:

The Good Doctor faces a change during the second season of the new, revived and CGI driven ""Doctor Who"". At the conclusion of the first season the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston in the first season) regenerates and ends up with a different face and slightly different personality (David Tennant in the second season). It was a convenient out for the BBC as actors came and went throughout the entire run of the series during the 60's, 70's and even the 80's (with a brief visit from a new Doctor for an Americanized TV movie during the 1990's). During the first episode of the new season the Doctor is all but immobilized because he absorbed the energy from the Tardas in order to save his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper).

Fans of Doctor Who will be delighted with the second season of the ""new"" series. While the series could be a bit inconsistent in the writing department even the weaker episodes benefit from the delightful performance of the ""new"" Doctor played by David Tennant (""Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire""). During the second season the Doctor and Rose Tyler his companion (Billie Piper) travel to an alternate universe where the Cybermen come into being, see the return of the Daleks (yet again), meet the Devil on a planet circling a black hole and help Queen Victoria fight off a werewolf. All in a days work with the Doctor using his wits and sonic screwdriver to save the day. Oh and the Doctor meets Sarah Jane a companion from a previous incarnation (from the Tom Baker Who years).

The menus are similar looking and with similar function to those for the first season.

A solid second season from producer/writer Russell T. Davies, Julie Gardner and the rest of the ""Doctor Who"" production staff, the best episodes from the second season easily hold their own with some of the classic episodes that featured Patrick Troughton, Tom Baker and other previous Doctors. While the price for the set is steep every episode comes with a commentary track, we get a nice booklet as part of the package and a solid disc of extras for fans of the show.

I'm hoping that Torchwood eventually shows up as well only because I'd like to find out what happened to Captain Jack.",1168992000,,4284,4.70894526034713
2669562,5,B000JBWWP6,"After the astounding climax to the first season, I found it hard to believe that this strong debut would ever be topped. The Christmas Special blew those doubts apart, as well as setting the tone (and some plotpoints) for the rest of the season. This episode is one of the most unusual in the show's history, as the Doctor is incommunicado for almost three-quarters of its running time. The payoff is huge, with the best debut of a Doctor that I have ever seen. There are so many great moments in those fifteen minutes. Seeing the Doctor work out who he is. The swordfight. Six words. Russell T. Davies really stamps his mark on the series with this episode.

The succeeding episodes all, arguably, vary in quality depending on how high your standards are. The most annoying aspect is the inclusion of Torchwood - which on reflection wasn't as subtle as the 'Bad Wolf' meme

from last season. For me, the standout were the perfect three episode run - Tooth and Claw (Russell T. Davies), School Reunion (Toby Whithouse) and the absolutely superb and near-perfect Girl in the Fireplace (from the brilliant Steven Moffat). All, for me, perfect Doctor Who episodes and also great examples of the different tones and themes that the series has explored throughout its long history.

New series fans may be perturbed that Rose gets less to do this season. It's clear, in retrospect, that the focus is on creating stories for the new Doctor. While Rose's backstory runs as a subplot in the background. In retrospect this is understandable, but was rather jarring on initial transmission. Especially as Russell's plan for this season wasn't entirely clear from the first few episodes.

The DVD Extras are as great as ever. In addition to the Confidential Cut-Downs, there's also the DVD Commentaries. Dissapointingly, Steven Moffat doesn't get a turn this time round, although he does provide commentary in a podcast freely available on the BBC's Dr Who website. However Russell T. Davies does commentate on Tooth and Claw, and is wonderfully entertaining and informative. It's also incredibly pleasing to see the new Doctor - David Tennant - make a big contribution to the DVD as well. He contributes commentaries to three episodes (School Reunion, Idiots Lantern, Doomsday). And also provides a whopping 85-minute video diary that covers the entire season. It's a suprisingly frank documentary, showing David's initial nervousness at both living up to the Legacy he so clearly idolises, and coping with the hectic schedule that seems to be the hallmark of this new series. Big Kudos to Tennant for providing such a generous look at what it takes to be the very best in this fantastic series. In addition to being one of the best Doctor's ever, he's also a great Ambassador for the show.

Looking back on it, the Second series is much much better than the already strong First season. Whether or not you enjoy it depends on whether or not you accept David Tennant as the Doctor. And whether you can accept that this new series flatly refuses to conform to fans expectations of what a Science Fiction should be. This is Doctor Who as big-budget Family Entertainment. In my case, the answer is a resounding yes. This second series has helped in laying a strong foundation for what is undoubtedly the greatest run this much-loved series has ever had. If I could, I'd give this 10 stars out of 5.

2669565,5,B000JBWWP6,"If you enjoyed the first season of the new show and felt apprehensive about season 2, fear not - even with a new face, Doctor Who is still a show that packs a lot of fun inside of a single hour.  Making the new Doctor his own, Tennant jaunts across time and space in a season of new shows that alternate between funny & dark (often within the same story), consistently surprising and - considering the ends it goes in time & space - thematically coherent (the joke becomes the tearjerker or vica-versa).  If the stories themselves sometimes verge into tiresome or recycled, scripts and deft use of characters make each episode a ""can't miss"".  (The new show develops strongly on the original's excellent focus on secondary characters or even one-shot characters - witness expanded roles for Rose's mum, and for Mickey; Pete Tyler even makes a reappearance - sort of; there's even an episode told entirely from the POV of regular humans who chart the Doctor's exploits on Earth.)

Highlights for Season 2 are expanded roles for Jackie & Mickey, a guest-spot for Sarah-Jane, run-ins with a young Madame de Pompadour & an extremely unamused Queen Victoria, Cybermen, Daleks, one more bad wolf, The Devil Himself and finally an episode in which it's revealed that TV is itself evil.  (no, I didn't make that up!!  Nor am I making up the fact that the world is saved by...Betamax!!!)  While other sci-fi franchises slavishly cater and conform to fans' ideas of what the show has always been, DW spends most of its time going in surprising new directions.  In ""The Idiot Lantern"", we find the Doctor being his usual fun-loving time-hopper.  Yet ""The Girl in the Fireplace"", displays a more romantic, over-the-top chivalrous streak in the guy.

The season culminated in a three-story arc involving the origins of the Cybermen and the unveiling of Torchwood, IMO, the weakest of the series.  The Cybermen, it's revealed, were developed on a parallel-earth where it's always sunny and the sky is full of airships.  (The opening shot looks like something off a Led Zeppelin album, or the cover of a ""Luther Arkwright"" story.)  Positing a cold & calculating race artificially developed by a wheelchair-bound evil-maniac-genius, ""Age of Steel"" draws inevitable comparisons to ""Genesis of the Daleks"" from 1975, without matching that classic story's moral dilemma nor the desperate circumstances that underlies the Dalek's creation.  (In ""Genesis"", crippled-genius Davros has been tasked to create mobile armor to house/sustain a new generation of Kaleds - a race of aliens doomed to horrible mutation due to the effects of an endless war; no similar society-wide pressures seem to mandate the creation of Cybermen, and their creator Lumic has all the mad-scientist dash of ""Doctor Evil"".)  Instead, the high-point was ironically ""The Satan Pit"", which name aside, surpassed its obvious debt to the disappointing movie ""Event Horizon"" and created some of the most compelling and outright scary hours of ""Doctor Who"".  In that ep., part of a 2-story arc, the Doctor lands on a dead asteroid hovering at the edge of a black hole that has devoured countless civilizations.  A team of humans ceaselessly drills to the core of the rock hoping to learn how the asteroid has managed to escape the black hole.  Mixing great effects and tension, the story is a great example of how both the new and original show highlighted guest characters.  Whether you were a fan of the old series or never caught on, Season Two shows why you'll be hooked.",1168128000,,3521,4.947368421052632
2669566,5,B000JBWWP6,"Five TIME-TRAVELING Stars? Can we make it SIX!!
The Guiness Book of World Records holder for the longest running Sci-Fi TV show, ""Dr Who"", entered it's 5th decade and posted a wonderful return with Doctor #9, Chris Eccleston, in Season One of the 21st century. But Doctor #10, David Tennant , the 9th regeneration of the venerable Doctor, has turned up the ""Whoovian"" heat considerably with ONE OF THE BEST Dr Who characterizations of all times as seen in ""Doctor Who-The Complete Second Series"" DVD set.  And I must say his interaction with Billie Piper's ""Rose Tyler"" is great. Even boyfriend Mickey and her Mom interact at a high personal level with Tennant. Those British producers have outdone themselves again in finding a wonderful actor with the range and humor to be a ""Doctor"". Decade after decade they have found actors who have all been, in one word and in their own way, MESMERIZING.

And the good news is that the stories are sensational and the villians are more outlandish and evil than ever before (gotta love those Krillitanes and that wild werewolf). And no more cheesy special effects and paper-mache monsters, the special effects are now FIRST RATE. My personal favorite story, ""The Girl in The Fireplace"", is vintage Dr Who, time-traveling backwards via a fireplace of all things, to France at the time of King Louis XV for fateful meetings with...Rinette. The story, and especially the gripping opening sequence, are destined to rank with the best of all time. And bringing back Elisabeth Sladen's ""Sarah Jane"" AND Tom Baker's metallic pooch ""K-9"" AND John Leeson, the original voice of K-9, in the story ""School Reunion"" was a genius stroke that shows how thorough these producers are.  It brought back alot of memories from the late 70's (but she did say she was from ""1980"" in the ""Pyramids of Mars"", touching off a dating controversy). This DVD box set would be a great way for grandparents and parents to introduce the kids to this unique and sensational science fiction character, but we Whoovians know they'd really be buying it for themselves.

2669567,5,B000JBWWP6,"Both the 2005 and 2006 Doctor Who series proves beyond a doubt that the good Doctor will never die... he just gets a new face now and again, albeit Mr. Eccleson's tenure was way too short.

However, I like this new face, David Tennant as well. He brings a bright, playfull, youthful exuberence to the role that has not been seen since Peter Davidson played the part. He also has the humor and wit that others have brought to the role since the Hartnell days. A good choice for the Doctor, indeed.

I haven't seen much of the 2006 season, so I am really giddy to see ""School Reunion"" wich features the return of my all time favorite companion, Sarah Jane Smith!  I met both Ms. Sladen and Jon Pertwee back in the early 80's at a Doc Who Convention, and a great pair they were, too. Both wee absolutely humbled at how massive a following they both had here in the states, especially Ms. Sladen, and I am so glad to see her back in the Doctor Who universe again.

That nonwithstanding, I am already looking foreward to Series 3, wich will feature the return of the Sontorans, along with a few more suprises.

Dang, I can only hope that we can get Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures as well...",1167782400,,1194,4.36036036036036
2669568,5,B000JBWWP6,"The BBC's new production of its classic series, Doctor Who, weathered its first major casting change admirably.  Most actors remain in the lead role for at least three years, but for Christopher Eccleston, one year was enough, and his Doctor (aka 'Nine') died in the season one finale.  In keeping with Who tradition, the Doctor, upon his death, regenerates into a completely new body.  Taking the TARDIS controls from Eccleston is another Russell T Davies alumnus, David Tennant (who headlined Davies' production of Casanova) as the tenth incarnation of the Doctor (aka 'Ten').  Tennant had his work cut out for him, following Eccleston's marvelous turn as the Time Lord, but he made the transition so seamlessly that the character truly seems like the same man in a different body.

Aiding this transition is largely the same writing and production staff, as well as the same co-star (Billie Piper as Rose Tyler) and supporting cast (Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler and Noel Clarke as Mickey Smith).  It's to Tennant's credit that he not only immediately puts his own stamp on the character but maintains Eccleston's level of chemistry with the supporting cast.  Ten is physically younger than Nine, more brash, more impulsive, less tormented by guilt, but still achingly lonely.  His loneliness becomes a running theme throughout the season, touched on in nearly every episode.  Eccleston played the Doctor as he played Steve Baxter in Davies' The Second Coming (a tormented otherworldly being); Tennant plays the Doctor as Casanova (a young, lovelorn romantic hero).

The Doctor's romantic attachments, in fact, become the vehicle by which Davies explores the central theme of loneliness.  Ten and Rose build upon and deepen the romance that Nine and Rose began in the first season.  Their love is palpable; they're often literally willing to die for each other.  In the UK, the series is family-oriented and rarely strays beyond the PG level, so this romance is never physically consummated; the characters don't even kiss.  Despite this--in fact, because of it--their feelings are all the more poignant.  (And how often do we see a depiction of true and abiding love on television that doesn't involve some kind of bump-and-grind?)  By the end of the season, the relationship has come full circle: the Doctor has taught Rose all he can; it's time for her to leave him and put to use all the things she's learned.  Their final separation is tragic but yet also hopeful: despite the sadness, the viewer knows Rose will thrive in her new environment.  Billie Piper's send-off couldn't have been more positive or more lovingly written (and it leaves open the possibility of her returning to the series in the future for a guest spot).

Nobody who leaves Who is ever truly gone.  The tremendous ""School Reunion"" brings back an old fan favorite, Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen).  Again, romance is the means by which Davies explores the Doctor's impact on his companions' lives.  The story is beautifully written: suspenseful, funny, romantic, and poignant.  Sladen slips back into the role effortlessly, and Anthony Stewart Head provides a wonderful villain in the sinister Mr. Finch.  Romance also infuses the imaginative ""Girl in the Fireplace,"" in which an army of clockwork repair droids from the fifty-first century stalks Madame de Pompadour (Sopia Myles).  The Doctor is clearly smitten with the young Reinette, but the episode's conclusion showcases how the heartbreakingly short human lifespan will always thwart such attachments.

But romance isn't all the second season has to offer: old foes return (Daleks, Cybermen, Cassandra) as well as old friends (Harriet Jones, Sarah Jane, K-9, Pete Tyler, the Face of Boe).  Also, the settings finally get away from Earth for a few episodes, and there are a couple of trips to Earth's past.  The recurring characters develop beautifully, especially Mickey Smith, who finally comes into his own as a hero.  Particularly good is the two-part story ""The Impossible Planet""/ ""The Satan Pit,"" which finds the Doctor and Rose in a bleak space station on a planet perpetually circling a black hole.  But the real standout of the season might well be ""The Christmas Invasion,"" an hour-long special that aired on Christmas day, 2005.  This episode allows the supporting characters--and by extension the viewers--an opportunity to adjust to the new Doctor, and it allows Ten to establish his heroic bona fides.  The guest cast is marvelous, particularly Penelope Wilton as the UK's new prime minister, Harriet Jones.  An argument between the PM and Ten at the episode's conclusion is brilliant, worthy of the West Wing, showing that Davies isn't afraid to challenge his viewers' perceptions of heroism and villainy.

Other highlights of the season are ""The Rise of the Cybermen""/ ""The Age of Steel,"" the chilling ""Tooth and Claw,"" the off-beat ""Love and Monsters,"" and of course, the brilliant finale, ""Army of Ghosts""/ ""Doomsday.""  Of all the episodes, only the disjointed ""Fear Her"" feels sub-par.  The overall quality of the season is remarkable, given the amount of backstage shuffling that took place (e.g., the timing of Piper's departure was initially unclear; a few episodes underwent last-minute rewrites).  And yet another challenge looms ahead for Davies as he reinvents the show in the wake of ""Doomsday,"" which writes out literally the entire supporting cast.  Only two seasons in, and an era has already ended.

Much of the season's success is owed to Tennant, who has quickly established himself as one of the most popular Doctors in the show's long history.  His own love for the series and the character shines through every moment he's on scene, and he effortlessly conveys the Doctor's past through his expressions, body language, and vocal inflections.  If Eccleston was ""Doctor Modern,"" Tennant is ""Doctor Classic-Modern,"" melding perfectly the older and more contemporary portrayals of the character.  His chemistry with Piper is nothing short of magical, and he also plays wonderfully off the supporting and guest actors.

As with the first season, the second season is best viewed in pristine DVD rather than the hacked-up versions shown on TV.  The boxed set includes the usual extras; viewers should make the Pudsey Cutaway/ Children in Need special their first stop--it's an essential prologue to ""The Christmas Invasion.""  Season two is proof positive that Doctor Who can hold its own with pretty much anything else currently on television.",1167264000,,6515,5.156993339676498
2669569,5,B000JBWWP6,"Being a fan of the old series watching the series all the way back to the original pilot, and the uneasy feeling of some of the later episodes of the series that didn't work then the failed ressurrection movie I was a little bit warry of a new series, but when the Sci-Fi channel began to air the episodes earlier this year (albiet in a slightly edited version) I decided to give it a try. The episodes pull you into the story, and make you forget that the failed movie was even there.

Both Doctors are great in their own respects, and David Tennant is definately pushed his way to the top of my list as my favorite Doctor of all time (even surpassing Tom Baker).

Rose Tyler is the perfect companion, and for those who have yet to see the series even on the Sci-Fi channel, she is a mix of Jo Grant (from the old series) with a little bit of Dawn Summers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) mixed in, to make the series palatable for Buffy fans.

The sexual tension that is present between the Doctor and Rose is a definate bonus and gives the show an almost soap opera feel. While this is something that was covered in minor detail (esp 3rd Doctor/Jo Grant; 4th Doctor Sarah Jane; 5th Doctor/Tegan) in the old series, they were never allowed to explore it as much as they seem to be able to in the modern series.

The special effects are stunning, and they definately seem to have a higher production quality than the old series.

What I also like about the new series is that you do not need to be a fan of the old series to like this series. While the price may be a little steep in the shops for my taste, the slightly lower price on Amazon makes it a little bit more palatable.",1167091200,,1675,4.238244514106583

The usual good (rather than dazzling, there are some omissions such as Attack of the Graske and the TARDISODES) set of extras are included. A 5.1 sound mix is also included (though hopefully it's better than last year's).

2669571,5,B000JBWWP6,"All in all a pretty good effort from David Tennant and Billie Piper.  The season gets off with a mediocre effort, New Earth. Kind of annoying how the Doctor treats the cat nurses after all they had done to cure humanity of disease.  They had to create guinea pigs to experiment their procedures on. I thought I wouldn't like this Doctor at all. But then a funny thing happened on the way to the finale.  The stories kept getting better and better! (Up to a point, which you will see.)  School Reunion is just that, bringing back two old favorites.  After seeing School Reunion, you will never look at Sarah Jane Smith's stories with Tom Baker's Doctor the same again. The Impossible Planet/Satan Pit sequels is perhaps the strongest effort, containing aspects of The Omen and Alien.

Then came a slight drop-off in story quality. Love and Monsters can claim to be the strangest, most unusual Doctor Who story ever seen, not good, but a decent story. Following The Satan Pit doesn't help it in terms of excitement. Fear Her is a pretty weak story with a couple nice moments, such as the Doctor lighting the Olympic torch at the end.  Just when I thought the season hit the skids, along came the tremendous finale, Army of Ghosts/Doomsday.  Believe me, this story is fantastic and leaves a lasting effect on the viewer.  You can feel the Doctor's sadness at apparently losing Rose forever.  It was also nice to see Mickey back again, not the same cowardly Mickey whom the Doctor refers to as Mickey the Idiot, but a brave freedom-fighting Mickey.

Don't let a couple weak stories spoil the whole season.  This is a season that builds towards an exciting and heart-wrenching climax.",1166486400,,1679,4.69283276450512
2669572,1,B000JBWWP6,"David Tennant's mugging doesn't help the tired, repetitive scripting.  Apart from the magnificent The Girl in the Fireplace, a bland rehash of the first season.

2669573,5,B000JBWWP6,"I loved Chris E's doctor.  I thought, ""NO! They can't take my doctor away from me after only one season!""  I was distraught.  I started to watch the new season with an air of ""how can they ever come back from this,"" and ""sure, the series has to go on..."", but then, then I slowly feel in love.  David Tenant has a way of looking into Billie Piper's eyes and making you feel like this terribly intelligent and easily bored demi-god is completely bound to her, and at the same time, is self-assured and full of life enough to make a complete arse of himself with her.  It looks like, from their chemistry on the show, that they are having a party every day on the set.

And again with the snarky humor.  David delivers it spot on.  Why oh why are there only 12 episodes in a year?  What torture waiting for the next season.",1164499200,,821,4.211538461538462
2669574,5,B000JBWWP6,"I guess I was extremely spoiled by Season 1 (see my review there), waiting all those years to find that once the show had returned, it was back with a spine tingling, take your breath away with excitement, jump out of your seat in disbelief of such glorious scripts and performances, absolute freaking vengeance.  Now, onto series 2, I was in no doubt looking and expecting nearly the same, albeit with a different actor at the helm.  This was nothing different for Who fans, and with some slim exceptions, it all worked out well.

I know some of you say we can't compare this and series one, or this and that, but hey, it's what Who fans have been doing throughout time.  I firmly believed that as an entire season, last seasons series 1 of the new show ranked up there as possibly the best full run of episodes in Who's full run.  Having to follow that would be a true test indeed, and while I thought season 2 was very enjoyable, it wasn't quite as strong as 1.

There was evidence even in the promising first episode, The Christmas Invasion, that there was some little je ne sais quoi that I couldn't quite put a finger on, that made is ever so slightly down a notch from the high impact of season 1's shows.  There was further evidence when it came to season 2's first real episode, New Earth, as it muddled along without a whole lot of excitement to take in.

Thankfully, after the very good reunion of The Doctor, Sarah Jane, & K9, the show seemed to keep creeping up and up in excitement quality, until the brilliant season finale two parter.  In fact, this two part mind blowing season finish, was probably the first time I had felt as ecstatic as I did watching the entire first series episodes.

I was displeased that the second season never felt as unique as series 1, but nonetheless still had fun watching yet another strong run of episodes in Who's continuing history.  After thinking about it more and more, I came to the realization that it was less David Tennant vs. Eccleston that made the two series different, and more about the strong writing of series 1 compared to the medoicre scripts of season 2.  Season 1 just had more snappy dialogue for the doctor, more impactful events tightly woven into the 50 minute episodes, and overall better stories.

That's not to say this season didn't have it's share of goodies, including one of my favorites, Idiot's Lantern, dealing with supernatural events in the 1950's, and leading into the very spooky two parter, The Impossible Planet, and the Satan Pit.  It's just I couldn't help but think when I watched season 1, that this was hands down the best show on TV, the best sci-fi episodes on TV, and the best Who in a long time.  With season 2, I can't safely say that I enjoyed it better than say a season of The Dead Zone, Stargate, or Stargate Atlantis, but I can say it's a very enjoyable piece of sci fi and another superb addition to the Who Universe.  I just wish the scripts were tighter and flowed better.

On to David Tennant.  It took me a few episodes, for me to take a liking to him, but quickly found that he is just as quirky a Doc as any predecessor and deserves his worthy place among the rest.  He can bring his serious side out just as quickly and believable as his distinct, flamboyant one.  I think having him a second season will be a welcome event, after having Eccleston for one short one.  Hopefully, they will get the writing a little more up to snuff, and the excitement level, so I can once again, safely say there is nothing better on TV than Who.  For right now, I can't, but it's still an excellent season of Who, a smooth transition into a new Doctor, and left at a point where this new, yet old, franchise can continue to grow.  Here's looking toward season 3 ...",1164412800,,3761,4.426705370101597
2669575,3,B000JBWWP6,"The first season of the new Dr. Who was great stuff, and Eccleston was a marvellous blend of confidence trickster, scientific genius, and damaged goods. The stories were also uniformly excellent.

The second season sees David Tennant take things in a more flippant direction -- this doctor is a little too blase for my liking, lacking in intensity (save the occasional flash) and more smart-arsey. He strikes me as a guy who knows how the script will end, so the dangers he face can be wise-cracked about rather feared and countered in desperation. Self-referential humor, with a hint that everyone knows it's just a TV show, might be fine for Monty Python or Ali G, but it's got no place in Dr. Who. Tennant is skirting dangerously close the 1960s ""Batman."" The second doctor, Patrick Troughton, was also jokey and humorous, but he never left you thinking he was just a good actor in silly clothes acting in a silly kids' program. Tennant almost, but not quite, leaves that impression. I don't like it.

Some of the stories are also weak: the werewolves particularly so (what were they, what did they want, why did the come to earth -- no idea), but also the coronation-day invasion by talking TVs. Formulaic, one could say. However, the Cybermen were excellent, and the double episode about the Ood is also terrific.

So this is solid Dr. Who, but not the best. One hopes season three will improve, particularly if Tennant drops his shoulder-shrugging stand-up routine. And we can hope for some old monster's back -- come on, BBC, what about giving us some Ice Warriors, or Sea Devils, or Silurians?",1164326400,,1601,4.772563176895307
2669576,5,B000JBWWP6,"I was very pleased with the second series of Dr Who.  In my view David Tennant makes an excellent replacement for Eccleston (who while good, didn't seem to fit into the role naturally).  The storyline takes a darker turn, with the rise of the sinister government agency Torchwood.  Several new and old adversaries return, including the dreaded cybermen.  The start and end to the series are both very well done, with the right balance between action, humour, and plot.

The series also engages in some intriuging explorations, including an episode featuring the visit to a planet orbiting a black hole, to revolutionary France, and to another paralell universe.

The series ends on a promising note, and I am sure it will only get better from this point onwards.",1163635200,,762,4.9140625
2669577,5,B000JBWWP6,"This is a wonderful second season. My husband and I bought the DVDs from England as they came out (and a region-free DVD player so we could watch them). Definitely worth it. Mr. Tennant is a very different Dr. Who than Mr. Eccleston. It was fun to watch him make the character his own. We actually watched the first season after the second season, because the quality of the second season was so high. The production values are amazing - every episode is better than most feature films. And we were very curious about Rose and the Doctor's relationship; there was obviously a lot of history between them already by the second season, and we just had to know why the Doctor trusted Rose so much. (We bought the second season because we liked David Tennant in ""Blackpool"" and wanted to see more of him.)

That said, I do miss Mr. Eccleston's Dr. Who; his doctor seemed to go down a long way. Mr. Tennant's Doctor is definitely more charming and roguish, but not quite as dark. I'm sorry I won't get to know Season 1 Doctor Who better.

Last thing: lots of people trashed the ""Love and Monsters"" episode, but I have to make a plug for it. I thought it was adorable. It was a fun idea - to look at Dr. Who through a portrait of his admirers. And of course, it had lots of ELO. Can't go wrong there.",1162771200,,1294,4.320987654320987
2669578,4,B000JBWWP6,"Unlike Chris E. David Tennent is not one to go pounding morals down your skull(though I did like Escleston's energy and dynamics) David Tennent's ""Tenth"", himself is not in foulable in his mishaps.  Tennent's 10th Who, (who) I also thought did quite well in ""Cassanova"" is a silly eccentric with more on being a crazy imperfect himself and eccepting that than being obligated to appologizing afterwards as did Chris E. .  Billy Piper odviously does not speek ""Pig Common"" though as her faked accent sometimes faulters in situations that Pig Common cannot artiqulate as in the bazaar sci-fi words and reactions to aliens.  Usually she comes off fine in normal situations that call for the Pig Common charm.  Might I suggest trying to emulate Peter Woodthorpe who is the ""Scum of Theives"" in his speech.  Also he was Gollumn in the Baski Lord of the Rings.  The boyfreind is a backwheel and depicts K-9 as such insulting both characters as being as such when they could be more pivotal and taken more seriously by the audience if things were just left to roll on.  Doc #9 hated everyone in Rose's life except Rose herself and this alienated the audience(at least me) from him.  Tennent does this but to a lesser degree.(and it is a good thing to a degree)  The irreprotiable 9 and 10 are both much like Tom Baker and Chris E. being more on William Hartnel with the exception that Tom Baker didn't leave people to die becasue of questionable ""character"" as did Escleston(Even Will Hartnel's 1st was merciful to us morons.).  Tennent has moved away from the mondane and moralistic modernizatons of Earth and it's Reala T show feel and is more like the Doctor(s) of old.  Though the feel is still the way Escleston's stories and atmopsheres were which I don't really like.  It is still entertaining and fun with Tenent and though I Liked Escleston's early ones(usually writen by Russel Davies himself) his later ones were more like Stargate and the cheapness of Sci-fi channel stuff and it's P.C. feel. Briton has a weird way of conveighing ideas to the audiances and I prefer the toned down morality checks of Tenent and even Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee who were more into the entertainment areas than the informative areas.  K-9 was not a second bannana to the companions!  Sarah Jane is not an ""Ender"" or a dead wash-out as ""she makes me smile in the End"" as the song(from her heyday) goes.",1161993600,,2386,4.690647482014389
2669579,5,B000JBWWP6,"As everyone has already said in their reviews, David Tennant does indeed step in Christopher Ecclestones considerably talented shoes with ease. He graces his Doctor with the same amount of energy and charisma as the previous Doctor, but also manages to imbue him with a more natural and engaging warmth.

The second series may lack some of the excitement and 'new-ness' of the first, but thanks largely to it's great cast it manages to steer ahead strongly, driven by broader plots and leading to a darker end.

But, for me, it's Rose who is the real star of both. Billie Piper, ex-teen singing pop sensation, just bristles Rose to real life. I can see this every girl on any street in London or Cardiff, full of ideas, energy, wit, fear, strength, joy..... just watching her play off the Doctors' eccentricities is a reminder to how we would all like to behave if ever confronted with a Time Lord!

The last two episodes are up with the best, and unlike a previous reviewer, I disagree with the final episode being a let down. My judgement? No thirty four year old man should ever cry in front of his misses and kids because of a TV show, but the fact that I did is all the proof I need!",1161734400,,1188,4.465437788018433
2669580,5,B000JBWWP6,"If you thought the return of the Doctor was over with the regeneration of the Doctor, you haven't seen David Tennant(Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire)as the tenth incarnation of the Timelord. Just as loaded with emotion depth and darkness as Chris E's Doc, but with a more traditional streak of classic quirky Doctor traits.

The Doctor is suffering from post-regeneration stress on the X-mas special opener ""THE CHRISTMAS INVASION."" Although the Doctor is out-of-it for a major part of the special, Billie Piper and crew carry on superbly until the climax. The greatness of the season opener is no exception, nearly all of the season two episodes are perfect!

The weakest episode is the New Earth (#2)which is the first to competely feature the new Doctor. The Cat-nurse hospital is true to the spirit of the series, but the best parts are body swaping moments in which Rose becomes the posh Cassandra from season one, and so does the Doctor (insanely funny, both performances). The rest of the season features some of the best work ever done in the shows 30+ history, bar none! Other reasons to buy this set:

The Doctor finally meets a werewolf

The return of Parallel universes

The return of Peter Tyler

The return of the Cyberman

The return of K9

The return of Sarah Jane

The return of mysterious reference threads (TORCHWOOD)

The return of another long time villain(s)in a long overdue monster mash smackdown of epic proportions!

The School Reunion, which features the Doctor's reunion with fan-fav compainion Sarah Jane Smith & K9, is a touching and tightly composed story that nicely sets the tone forshadowing things to come, namely the amazing season finale.

The writing is terrific in each episode, the reinvention of the Cybermen, set up more stories that the fans themselve would have written. The Cybermen return for the finale along with some legendary uninvited party guest. Just like last season, you'll be asking yourself ""why hasn't someone done these stories already, WOW!""

Bring on the 3 season! Love & Monsters 4 ever!",1161561600,,2053,4.933139534883721
2669581,5,B000JBWWP6,"Casting a new Dr Who to replace Christopher Eccleston was never going to be easy for the BBC and Russell T Davies. Eccleston had made the role his own and his untimely departure had frankly put the successfully revived show into jeopardy.
Fortunately, along comes David Tennant who gets into the role with relish. It is pointless trying to compare Eccleston and Tennant against each other because both have such very different approaches to playing the Doctor. Tennant retains some of the intensity that Eccleston brought to the screen but his Doctor is more relaxed and laid back. Indeed, he is full of the eccentricity that previous doctors brought to the character.

Just like the first series, the second series is a delightful collection of episodes, some are naturally better than others but this is normally the case in any TV series generally.
Episodes to watch out for are Tooth And Claw where Tennant and Rose (again superbly played by Billie Piper) have to protect Queen Victoria from a werewolf, The Age of Steel and Rise Of the Cybermen have a superb reincarnation of one of the Doctor's greatest foes (even if the plotting could have been better), The Satan pit and Inmpossible Planet two parter, and School Reunion which sees the return of K9 and Sarah Jane Smith.
However, the real cream of the series comes down to three episodes:
The Girl In The Fireplace which is a superbly realised love story as the Doctor battles to save Madame Pompadour from the clutches of a sentient spaceship and clockwork androids...
Army Of Ghosts and Doomsday see the return of The Cybermen when they invade the Earth in their millions, and the Torchwood centre is shown in detail for the first time. Into this mix,however, then comes the Doctor's most dreaded foes - The Daleks....

Anyone who enjoyed the first series will get their money's worth out of this. Tennant has turned out to be a superb Doctor and Billie Piper again excels as Rose, his assistant. Sadly though, this is Rose's last series and David Tennant will have a new assistant for the currently filming Series Three.
That said, Billie Piper has indicated though that she would like to return to the role but in the newly created Dr Who spin off - Torchwood which features Captain Jack from the first series, again played by John Barrymore.
Hats off to Russell T. Davies has again done a superb job with the scripts for this second series of Dr Who. Fans will be pleased to know that Russell is also scripting the raunchy Sci Fi spin off from Dr Who - Torchwood, which on the strength of its first two episodes looks likely to be a winner too.

Fans of the series may be interested to know that Amazon.co.uk are releasing a limited edition pack of Doctor Who - The Complete Second Series in a three dimensional Cyberman head box, with other goodies inside. This will be available from the 20.11.06. be aware though that this is a Region 2 dvd set and you will need a multi-region dvd player to be able to watch this. Yet another dvd that justifies upgrading to a multi-region player, if you do not yet have this facility.....

2669582,5,B000JBWWP6,"The Second series of Doctor Who is much better then the first series.  The acting of David Tennant really makes the series so much better.  Also Billie Piper has grown in her acting skills and plays well off of Tennant.  Here is my take on the episodes rated with 4 being the best.

THE CHRISTMAS INVASION: The Doctor is stuck in bed most of the episode leaving Rose to figure out how to stop an alien invasion.  David Tennant plays the Doctor as if he always has been.  ***

NEW EARTH:  The Doctor takes Rose to her first alien planet where and old enemy is waiting for them.  This is not my fav. episode but it does have some nice character moments.  **

TOOTH AND CLAW:  The Doctor and Rose find themselves in Scotland where they meet Queen Victoria, Evil Monks and a Werewolf.  Plotholes aside this is a very enjoyable episode.  The special effects are some of the best i've seen on the show.  ***

SCHOOL REUNION:  The Doctor investigates a school where strange things are happening.  This episode is very fun for two reasons:  The Doctor meets some old friends(Sarah Jane Smith and K-9!!!)  Also that jealousy that sparks between Rose and Sarah Jane.  Also Anthony Stewart Head is great as the villian Mr. Finch.  ***1/2

THE GIRL IN THE FIREPLACE:  The Doctor, Rose and Mickey arrive on a spaceship in the 54th century where they find timeholes leading back to earth's past.  This episode is one of my top favs.  ***1/2

RISE OF THE CYBERMEN:  One of the Doctor's greatest enemies is about to come to life on a parallel earth.  This episode marks the return of the cybermen and Rose's father.  ***

THE AGE OF STEEL:  This episode is much darker then rise, but the dark atmoshpere adds much to the story.  Also Mickey's charater arc takes a surprising turn.  ***

THE IDIOT'S LANTERN:  It's the 1950s and the coronation of The Queen just days away.  People all over england are getting turned into faceless zombies by their televisions.  This is mostly a filler episode but with some fun bits.  Not my fav. but still enjoyable.  The villian is also not that great.  **1/2

THE IMPOSSIBLE PLANET:  The impossible has happened a planet orbiting a blackhole.  Can The Doctor find out why before something deep within the planet awakes?  This is a very fun episode and also an episode thats not set on earth.  ***1/2

THE SATAN PIT:  As Rose is threatened by The Ood, The Doctor faces an anicent evil.  This episode is a classic.  ****

LOVE AND MONSTERS:  An ordinary man becomes obsessed with The Doctor and tries to find him.  This episode is not as bad as everyone says it is.  The villian is dumb but the story shows what happens to the people the Doctor leaves behind.  **1/2

FEAR HER:  Another filler episode filled with some nice character bits.  Beware the giant scribble.  **

ARMY OF GHOSTS:  Torchwood is revealed while the Doctor is taken prisoner.  Who are the Army of Ghosts?  Rose comes into her own in this episode.  A Great episode.  ****

DOOMSDAY:  As Torchwood and the world is invaded, will the Doctor be able to save us?  A heartbreaking conclusion to an excellent season.  A great episode with a somewhat offbeat cliffhanger.  ****",1160697600,,3159,4.577617328519856
2669583,4,B000JBWWP6,"Series One was a tacky, self-mocking soap opera set on Earth with lots of trademarks from ""Doctor Who"" inserted just so the series title could be validated.  But while series 1 has its problems, it did have a few worthy moments too.  So, how does series 2 compare?

Series Two does feel more like 'traditional, Classic Who', especially compared to series 1.  There are a few issues (just about all of it is Earth-based AGAIN), but all and all it's definitely a tremendous improvement.

David Tennant is a refreshing change from the do-nothing Christopher Eccleston.  From the wacky to the serious, and from being pro-active and right down to the costume, improvements are all over the place.

The overall quality of series two's episodes is definitely sporadic.  Series 1 has a similar feel with all of its stories, even if the stories themselves were lacklustre at best.  Season Two goes all over the place in tone and intellectual quality, and despite its clunkers is definitely worth the different format (and actor!)

Indeed, the fact Tennant argued for the character's name in the end credits to be renamed to ""The Doctor"" is inspiring.

Rated on a 4 star basis, 4 is best and 0 is worst:

THE CHRISTMAS INVASION * * 1/2

The new Doctor spends most of the episode in a coma, leaving Rose and Mickey to figure out what's up with a bunch of mysterious and deadly Christmas figures and decorations.  The only saving grace here is Tennant's performance, and he's kept to the side for most of it.  Still, his presence gives us hope...

NEW EARTH 1/2

Think we'll finally get a story set on another planet?  Not quite.  The replacement for Earth is still called Earth.  The whole thing felt like a throwback to Eccleston's era, right down to body function jokes and sexual innuendo -- mindless fluff that is not ""Doctor Who"".  This one nearly had me calling it quits... glad I kept on.

TOOTH AND CLAW * * * 1/2

Queen Victoria, werewolves, odd karate monks...  everything about this is rather good.  But something called a Torchwood?  Hmmm...

SCHOOL REUNION * * *

anthony Stuart Head steals the show as the villain.  It also adds some new depth into Mickey.  It also brings back Sarah Jane and K9.  My problem with this one is, Sarah Jane is made out to be an ex-lover of the Doctor.  (even Mickey states an obvious comment and we're grateful it wasn't the Doctor who said it.)  It's got a lot of great moments (and in ways is what ""Logopolis"" should have been), but the bad moments (involving the verbal sparring between Sarah Jane and Rose) are cringing.  still, all things considered, it's worth 3 out of 4.

THE GIRL IN THE FIREPLACE * * * 1/2

Another winner, yet with another drunken excuse to thrust in more sexuality.  This time, it's the Doctor himself going after a lady.  Everything else about this story is great...  then consider the writer of it wrote the British comedy ""Coupling"" and it all makes sense as to why the Doctor has to have a sex life.  Sigh... why???  Why continue to humanize an alien character for pointless ratings?  On the flip side, the ship itself is an inverse of a Cyberman:  Human organs operating a machine mind.  That was way-cool.  But the sexual flippancy that's prevalent in the new series in general, why why why?

RISE OF THE CYBERMEN * * *

An interesting twist on the re-invention of the Cybermen:  a parallel dimension.  (could this parallel Earth be Mondas, the Cybermens' home world in our universe?)  We also get the big revelation the TARDIS is organic.  (that's great if the idea of organic technology hadn't been developed by any number of sci-fi authors in the past, including ""Doctor Who"" back in 1971 with ""The Claws of Axos""!)  The cliffhanger is decent too...  but this one is actually decent.

THE AGE OF STEEL * * 1/2

Mickey is still great.  Unfortunately, that's about it.  The sonic screwdriver, which has been misused and overused in the past, is really OTT in this episode as, amongst other things, it distracts a whole regimen of Cybermen.  We also don't need the 59th reminder this is not ""our"" Earth therefore it's not ""our"" Jackie and Pete.  The cliffhanger resolution is paltry...  there are some redeeming scenes, such as getting to empathize with a converted human...  but it's not a perfect resolution.  And parallel technology seems quite compatible despite their universe being much more advanced.  Still, if you don't think about plot holes, changed motives, or bad ideas in general, this story (along with most of them) would all be 4 out of 4 stars.

Also, the new Cybermen costumes aren't all that great either.  Sci-fi fans will recognize it as an amalgamation of C3PO (Star Wars) with Melkur (from the Doctor Who story 'The Keeper of Traken')

THE IDIOT'S LANTERN * * *

Not the best explained, but definitely a creepy and interesting idea regarding technology consuming peoples' lives.  (there are two themes in this series:  1 is Torchwood, which seems forced at times.  The 2nd is the integration of technology into peoples' lives, usually for bad effect.  This 2nd one is far more interesting and worthy, and the metaphor used in 'The Idiot's Lantern' is quite good indeed...)

THE IMPOSSIBLE PLANET * * * 1/2

Hmmm.  Should be a classic.  But why isn't it?  The fear factor is there, many moments that could have ended up as hokey jokes were played straight...  but there's no depth to the plot.  Not even little hints of intellectual depth.  Nothing to think about, it's just been spooned out to viewers.  But it is tense, gripping, and worthy...  but it's a tease.  The first time we're away from Earth and there's no alien civilization.  Just more bogeymonsters.

THE SATAN PIT * * * 1/2

Premonitions and resolutions.  Indeed, this conclusion to ""The Impossible Planet"" is very good indeed, and while the Beast is too synonymous with a particular religion, it's venerable.

LOVE & MONSTERS ___

WHY?  It's a parody of WHO fans, but at least it's parodying the new series rather than the classic one.  Some bits do work, but others are awful.  I like the idea of the monster, but they had to go overboard with the crass crudeness and bodily function jokes, of which series 2 has been mostly devoid of -- up until now.  Oh well, I shouldn't have had high hopes.  (the writer must be a fan of FOX cartoon shows...)  I won't bother to mention the final gag scene at the end.  All I'll say is ""there's a literal meaning to that"".  It redefines low.

FEAR HER * * *

Hmmm.  It seems to be a knock-off of a potential ""Sapphire and Steel"" story.  (or for Americans, it's rather like an episode of ""The X-Files"".)  The trouble is, the story loses its way at the 35 minute mark and never recovers.  As usual, the more interesting points aren't explained.  It's a real mixed bag, but the good points (e.g. the Doctor being trapped) make up for it.  The lead-in to the next story was also great at the time.

ARMY OF GHOSTS * * * *

No more silly references, Torchwood is revealed.  Smooth.  Not quite the same theme as ""Bad Wolf"" (for ""Bad Wolf"", Rose created it but the circumstances were implausible), but it's not as loosely shrugged off either (we had no idea how Torchwood would be defined... or how it could exist without UNIT knowing about it, but that's fair too).  This is Russell T Davies' best WHO story of them all.  It's taut, gripping, has some intelligence behind it (though I was hoping it'd be more than parallel universe cybermen wandering into ours), and then there's that cliffhanger that nobody expected -- the return of Daleks.

DOOMSDAY *

Okay, let's turn the whole affair into a parody of a self-mockery.  Apart from the initial Dalek/Cybermen spat, there is nothing worthy here.  Even RTD can't decide if the Genesis Ark is Dalek or Time Lord technology and merrily mixes it up as he goes along.  Worse, having been told 5,000 times that he's not our Pete and not our Jackie, the Doctor seems intent on getting Rose to stay with them.  And for all the maudlin drivel over Rose saying she's dying, she's also suggesting she wasn't alive until she met the Doctor.  This means she's only 2.  Hmmm, sounds about right...  Billie Piper is a great actress, but Rose was always a huge annoyance when not being a bland one.)  So much plot potential was thrown out by empty excuses, and for the big build-up of Rose's death of fighting a big foe, this is one real cheat.  And it's a real shame; I was expecting so much more from a terrific build-up.

I am looking forward to series 3.  All in all, the improvements far outweight the silly quibbles that the production team and writers can't seem to wholly divorce themselves from, but series 2 is a massive improvement.",1160524800,,8668,4.62606978275181
2669584,5,B000JBWWP6,"Season Two of the new series is a really odd mixed bag - as any season of Doctor Who should be.  The new series' honeymoon is over: now that the shock of ""Wow, Doctor Who's back!"" has worn off, viewers will inevitably start to become more critical of the show, and by having such an outstanding opening season, Doctor Who now falls into the position of having to top itself after setting a really high standard.

David Tennant makes an immediate impression as the new Doc, effortlessly stealing the show from Christopher Eccleston.  Everyone's going to compare him to Tom Baker, of course, but I think the previous Doctor he resembles most is Sylvester McCoy, with his exhuberent clownish exterior hiding a really, really dark edge.

The overall quality of this season's episodes was more mixed than the first season.  Season Two's best episodes were better than those in Season One, but the weak spots were poorer.

THE CHRISTMAS INVASION  * * * * 1/2

The new Doctor spends most of the episode comatose while aliens invade the planet, forcing Rose and Prime Minister Harriet Jones to step up to bat.

NEW EARTH  * * *

The first excursion off-planet for the new series.  This episode tries to be all things at once - comedy, thriller, zombie movie and tear-jerker - and as a result feels a little scattered.

TOOTH AND CLAW  * * * *

The first great episode of season two will now be shown at my house every Halloween.  Queen Victoria, a werewolf, kung-fu monks (!?!), and heavy product-placement for this fall's ""Torchwood"" spin-off.

SCHOOL REUNION  * * * * 1/2

This was the episode I was looking forward to the most this year, with the return of Sarah Jane Smith and K-9.  Anthony Head gives a wonderfully understated performance as the villain - he would've made a great Master!

THE GIRL IN THE FIREPLACE  * * * * *

Each of the first four episodes gets better than the last, with this being the peak of the first half of the season.  The Doctor falls head-over-heels for an 18th century French aristocrat while trying to stop an insane spaceship from the future from stealing her brain.  (You can't explain the plot to this one without giggling.  But it WORKS! Fantastic!)  The romantic plot would have made this a controversial episode if it hadn't been so damn good.

RISE OF THE CYBERMEN  * * * 1/2

Here we go.  After the Daleks in season one, the Cybermen were the next classic monster we knew we were going to see return.  The new series uses the clever idea of throwing the TARDIS into a parallel universe so we can discard all Cyberman backstory and start over from scratch.  Since this is a two-part story, any Who fan will know to resign himself to not seeing the monster until the cliffhanger at the end.  In the meantime, the episode plays with the alternate-Earth concept and the temptations that can present for the Doctor's sidekicks.

THE AGE OF STEEL  * * * *

Part two of all-out Doctor vs. Cybermen action!  A great conclusion to the build-up of part one, and a wonderful step in the character arc of Rose's sorta boyfriend Mickey, who was so useless in the beginning of season one.

The great thing about the Cybermen is that they were the Borg long before there was a Borg.  Unfortunately, since the Borg design is so much creepier it makes the Cybermen look pretty silly, even with the cool new outfits.

THE IDIOT'S LANTERN  * * *

The Doctor and Rose wind up in the Fifties and find that dozens of middle-class London suburbanites have been turned - literally - into faceless drones by their TV sets.  Metaphor anyone?

One problem with the show at this point is that it now becomes obvious that the Doctor and Rose's relationship - which was visibly growing throughout the first season - has gone about as far as it can without breaking through the family-friendly-TV barrier that we know it won't.

THE IMPOSSIBLE PLANET  * * * * *

The high point of the entire season, and possibly the entire series so far.  Definitely the scariest 45 minutes of Doctor Who to date.  The Doctor and Rose land on the set of ""Alien"" and find a crew of humans drilling to the core of a planet in orbit around a massive black hole.  I guess the words BAD IDEA are no longer in the language five thousand years from now.

THE SATAN PIT  * * * * *

Part two.  The Beast's minions swarm through the base while Rose and the explorers try to escape.  Meanwhile, the Doctor descends into the bowels of Hell to come face to face with the devil himself.  Like ""The Empty Child"" two-parter from season one, this is one of those classics I'll be watching over and over again.  Just don't make me chose between the two.

LOVE & MONSTERS  * * *

Here's where the season starts to wind down and you can tell the money was running out.  The episode follows an 'average bloke' who meets the Doctor and becomes obssessed with him.  I appreciate it when a show takes risks, but if this one had been played more seriously it would have worked better.

FEAR HER  * *

No thanks.  A cheap filler episode about a girl with supernatural powers that winds up like a cross between X-Files and Sesame Street.

ARMY OF GHOSTS  * * * *

Annnd we're back!  The intensity of the first half of the season returns, as the Earth suffers from a massive haunting and the Doctor finally crosses paths with Torchwood.

DOOMSDAY  * * * * *

Somehow, the second season tops the emotional climax of the first as two classic Who monsters battle in the streets of London and we learn the final fate of Rose Tyler.  Choices are made, choices are taken away, and the Doctor ends up with a whole new hole in his soul.  Bring tissues.",1160438400,,5605,4.45903257650543
2669585,5,B000JBWWP6,"Eccelston did a fantastic job as the Doctor and Tennant just gets better and better as the series progresses. The wonderful thing about this incarnation is that you don't have to have been a fan from the early days. The show is accessible to new viewers, while holding onto the history - as evidenced by Sarah Jane and K9. The story telling is marvelous and it's great to see a show in this day and age that does not always wrap up at the end of the broadcast hour.

This series has drama, humor, tragedy, everything you could want in excellent TV. For the new viewer, and the old, we learn more about how the Doctor came to be the last of the Time Lords, and he gives out tidbits of his history for the new viewer.

When you get these DVDs, sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. It's fantastic!",1160438400,,793,4.245033112582782
