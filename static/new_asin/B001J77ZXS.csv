8312103,5,B001J77ZXS,"Bait car is great for laughs, Jacked is great for an action look at catching car thieves. Watching the show just makes me want to join the task force. Great video of the NJ cops boxing stolen cars in with trucks with huge bumpers. It's like swat on wheels. Too bad it was only for one season.",1317859200,,292,4.140350877192983
8312104,4,B001J77ZXS,"My husband loves this show! I think it would be a good gift for anybody who is into law enforcement reality shows like Cops.

The show follows around a group of offices in the Newark NJ auto theft task force. Interesting how they get these guys. Sometimes, it's via a Lojack and other times, they'll leave a car running with the doors unlocked. If somebody takes it, they jump on him.

If this sounds good to you, you'll like the show!",1309132800,,435,4.3580246913580245
8312105,4,B001J77ZXS,"Jacked will get your blood flowing as they take you on an adventerous ride through Newark, NJ in the middle of the night. A set of high-powered trucks patrol the neighborhoods looking for stolen cars. And when they find one, you'll be amazed at how well-coordinated they are.

They surround a car with amazing automobilic stealth. Then they pounce on a target with speed. What happens next is anybody's guess. Maybe it's not a stolen car and their wrong. Maybe a guy whips out a gun or takes a hostage. Or maybe they'll flee with thousands of dollars worth of drugs.

Whatever they do, you'll enjoy watching the brave men of Newark's finest bringing down the cowards of the street.

As an added bonus, they'll let you know what happened (legally) to the suspect when the information is available.",1299801600,,796,4.712230215827338
8312106,5,B001J77ZXS,If you like watching stupid people do stupid things and getting caught then watch Jacked.,1279324800,,89,5.0
8312107,3,B001J77ZXS,"I got this video and watched it at work.  It was great.  I liked to watch all the BIG crime guys fall apart after they understant they are going to jail.  LOL That is great.  I also liked to see how they got more advanced tools to help them do the job in the future.  THe computer that scans plates I had seen before but not like this.  It was educational to see how that works and I hope in time they put it on all police cars.  IT scans the plates and tells if the car is stollen, registered, if the owner is wanted...  THe only down side is too much advetising is set up prior to comercials... that are not in the video.  They should have cut that out but then the video would have been not as long.",1272153600,,702,3.921985815602837
8312108,5,B001J77ZXS,"I saw this series on A&E - i can't get enough of this stuff.  The series follows the Union/Essex Auto Task force (based in Newark NJ) as they combat auto theft.  The cast is very likeable and comprises a tight-knit team of seasoned cops for this specialized operation.  They use some high-tech methods & gadgets to do their jobs - rigged decoy cars (that can be locked + stalled out, via remote control, to trap the thieves), computerized license plate identifiers that scan and ID stolen cars in seconds, and the like.  A lot of cat-and-mouse situations in the series, as they pursue auto theft suspects (and sometimes, end up involved in helping out other law enforcement operations, catching suspects wanted for other crimes, etc).  Very interesting to watch - if you like ""COPS"", this series will definitely appeal to you.  Above all, this series will give you an appreciation for the risks that the police take in protecting people & property on a daily basis - this is really, really dangerous work, in that the nature of this particular type of law enforcement virtually GUARANTEES high-speed chases, direct confrontations with criminals and a lot of tense situations once they stop and have to arrest the suspects.",1235692800,7,1222,4.879227053140097
