8664804,5,B00LAB2K24,Pure Rolling is a great compilation of different people from this academy rolling (Jiu Jitsu sparring) together. Every rolling session is narrated by Mr. Roy Dean explains the movements while they are happening as well as detailing the good things as well as the mistakes that take place. It's great because you get to explore the different styles each person has and how different styles have to adapt in order to flow with the other person.,1478390400,,442,4.828947368421052

The only thing that would make it better in my opinion is more a vocalized breakdown after the matches to discuss the strategies and applications while the roll was happening.",1462233600,,251,4.8604651162790695
