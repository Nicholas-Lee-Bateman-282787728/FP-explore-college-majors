The acting in the film was not to blame for the dismal failure of this film, the blame for that lies with the costuming, the director and most of all the screenwriter.

The film is not the worst out their but given the choice again of watching this film or sponge bathing seniors at the old people's home, I will head on over to the home without a doubt.",1345334400,,487,4.4
5114996,5,B007Z722CK,"This movie was incredible! Suspenseful the ENTIRE time. It never got boring or slow. I normally fall asleep during movies, but not this one! A definite thumbs up for horror movie fans everywhere.",1345334400,2,195,4.9393939393939394
5114997,5,B007Z722CK,"I was fortunate enough to be able to see Carl on the night of its premier! As I walked into the theater and took my seat, I thought I knew what to expect. A movie with 2 dimensional characters and lots of awesome bloody killing. I was quite pleasantly surprised that this wasn't the case. In fact, although there were a few excellent kills, writer and director Greg Daniel went in a different direction than most horror films I have seen lately.

I found myself shocked at how real the characters seemed. (I'm definitely glad that I saw this movie after spending so much time in the backwoods of Kentucky instead of before!) Carl wasn't shockingly bloody or gory, it introduced a different kind of horror than I'm used to. Discomfort. There was actually a moment after a particularly uncomfortable scene when you could literally hear an audible sigh of relief, from everyone in the theater, that it was over.

All in all, if you are a fan of horror movies, Carl will be an excellent addition to your collection! I can't wait to see what else is to come from the strange, twisted mind of Greg Daniel!",1335916800,6,1099,4.545454545454546
5114998,5,B007Z722CK,I was one of the lucky ones that got to be one of the first to see this film in the theater for the premier.  This film will exceed all of your expectations.  Awesome story that keeps you thinking and wondering what is going to happen next.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  This film is something you definitely want to own!  Keep your eyes out for more to come from Greg Daniel.  I have a feeling this is the beginning of something very big for him!  To follow him on Facebook go to:  [...],1335830400,4,505,3.98

8523307,3,B007Z722CK,"This movie was okay, the acting was bad. It starts out slow but then just takes off, it was hard to figure out what was going on and who is who, but then I think I figured it out. The only thing that I did not get was the daughter!? Who's she was and where did she go?? and why??
Sick family! I would say it is worth the watch.",1506729600,,327,3.6857142857142855

8523309,1,B007Z722CK,"The concept of this movie was ok, it just wasn't executed effectively to make it a good movie. The actors were all horrible, and could not act worth a damn, except for the mother.  If I could give it a minus c zero I would.",1506297600,,223,3.9555555555555557
