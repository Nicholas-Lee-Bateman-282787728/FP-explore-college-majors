8412598,4,B0041C4LG2,"I originally purchased the DVD but gave it to my son. I ended up buying the tapes for myself because of the price difference. Now I wish that I had purchased the DVD instead because the VCR's are being phased out. I didn't realize that the series were on 4 separate tapes, taking up more room on my shelves than one DVD...duh! I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the bulkiness of 4 tapes when they could have put the series all on one. The content is amazing!",1304294400,,466,4.131868131868132
