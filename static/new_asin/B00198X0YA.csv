3425123,5,B00198X0YA,"It was pretty cruel to release the first half of the 2nd season without the second half-we don't even get to see the Avalon journey completed. On top of all that, Hunter's Moon just may be one of the best gargoyles episodes created, and I want it on dvd! Because I support the revival of Gargoyles so much, I refuse to buy any of the new merchandise coming out used, and if I don't get something for as cheap as possible, that's saying a lot. Lets hope the more comments on this page, the more likely it is that the second volume will come out.",1215648000,43,544,4.190476190476191
3425124,5,B00198X0YA,"I've been eagerly waiting for this release since the day I bought Season 2 Volume 1 back in 2005.  I really hope Disney goes ahead and releases this.  Some extras could include:

1. The Bad Guys Leica Reel
2. Another ""Gathering of the Cast"" featurette with the rest of the cast
3. ""The Journey"" from The Goliath Chronicles
4. A copy of the soundtrack

This is one of the most intelligent, mature, and well-crafted shows I've ever seen - animated or otherwise.  It definately deserves to be seen in its entirety.",1214956800,4,511,4.571428571428571
3425125,5,B00198X0YA,"Oh my goodness - if this IS a real sign that Disney is FINALLY relinquishing the last DVD of canon Gargoyles - I just may have to do some sort of impromptu happy-dance, and, like, buy a ridiculous party hat or something, to commemorate the occasion. It would be WONDERFUL, I am seriously going to just hope and PRAY for this to be legit!

._. And as this is a review, I shall say that I predict that it shall be amazingly awesome. As Gargoyles always is. And the seasons being COMPLETED would be more than awesome, that'd just be -

3425126,4,B00198X0YA,"Gargoyles is still one of my favorite shows of all time. I've been dying for the rest of the series to come out on DVD. I've searched the web (rather extensively) for any word on an upcoming release but alas I've come up dry. If and when this DVD is released, I'll be posting a more in-depth review of its content and quality. Until then support the previous Gargoyles releases and hope for the best.

UPDATE December 30, 2014:

Well, after a decade, Disney has finally done what we've waited for them to do. So many, many fans of been highly anticipating having the second volume of season two of ""Gargoyles"" on DVD... and on January 15, 2015, it will be here. Now, for those who remember, back in December of 2005, Disney released the first half of season two and it was a great set (perhaps the bonus features weren't quite up to par with season one, but still a wonderful presentation of a show that deserves all the love it gets). Since that time, thousands of fans have virtually begged and pleaded for the series to be released in its entirety, and online petitions began popping up. A while back, Disney released a limited edition of season two volume two on their Disney store site, but it was an exclusive item, not available for retail and its presentation left something to desire. This is where it gets exciting. Disney listened to the fans. They are released season two, volume two on DVD in an attractively packaged set that is only selling for $15.99 (Amazon's pre-order price is only $9.99). I don't know about you, but after all the times that Disney has been a bit stingy with their releases, or released the same movies over and over while neglecting cult classics and little seen films, this is a real victory for fans and for Disney as well. I can only hope that as many people as possible pick this new set up and show their support for ""Gargoyles"" as a show and for the fandom. Maybe ""The Goliath Chronicles"" and other long sought after classics of animation will see the light of day as well.",1213401600,31,2017,4.493188010899183
3425127,5,B00198X0YA,I don't think this link was even here two weeks ago. Did they just add this??? Is Amazon trying to tell us something? PLEASE tell me Disney finally woke up and decided to release the rest of Gargoyles on DVD... They can't let their best animated series just rot like they have...,1211414400,3,279,4.384615384615385

3425137,5,B00198X0YA,This is the wrap up for the series. Unfortunately after this season they went with another director and animator. Goliath's chronicles aren't even worth watching. Fortunately all the plot points from season 1 and 2 have been wrapped up in a pretty bow. I wish Disney had given the series more time but it at least ends in a good place. There were comics that continue the story from here but they were discontinued and are a little expensive to get ahold of.,1510012800,2,458,4.530120481927711

3425139,5,B00198X0YA,"I grew up with the series, have always loved it and even looked for the DVDs in the early 00s but I wasn't about to pay $100s to have them then.  These were packaged well and in great shape.  I am very glad I could find these well drawn cartoons with great storytelling from the 1990s.

In case you don' know it was a time with a lot of cartoons with better characters and deeper stories than even some movies (not to mention almost all of the cartoons since then!).  Just so you know I'm not just saying that due to nostalgia either, look up the TV show ""Adventures of The Gummi Bears"" which despite reading a brief synopsis of it is quite amazing!  ;)  ...Though I hear this particular volume of the Gargoyles isn't considered canon by the creators for some reason.  =/",1506988800,,771,4.3125

3425148,4,B00198X0YA,"If you're reading the reviews for this product, I assume that you're already familiar with Gargoyles so I'm not going to spend much time describing the plot of this DVD. This volume features the remainder of the ""world tour"" episodes up through the climactic showdown in Hunter's Moon. There are a lot of great episodes in this volume, such as Grief, M.I.A., and Future Tense. The picture quality is surprisingly impressive - even on our big flat screen TV the episodes look excellent. It ain't Blu-Ray quality of course, but it ain't bad.

While the show itself is great, I am admittedly a bit disappointed with the DVD however. It feels bare-bones, especially in comparison to the previous volume. This volume features all of the remaining episodes of season 2 and... not much else. Unlike the previous DVD, here there is no bonus material at all. The previous DVD had special episode intros with Greg Weisman as well as full audio commentary for the 4 City of Stone episodes, for example. The previous volume also came in a high quality folding case that featured a note from Greg Weisman, an episode listing, and discs with gorgeous artwork. The case itself had 3 separate ""slots"" for the 3 discs, which kept the discs safe from scratches. Season 2 Volume 2 (the product I am reviewing) has no bonus features, a lazily made case (the 3 discs are all placed in the same slot), and it doesn't even have an episode list in the box - I printed out a simple episode listing of my own so that I could find specific episodes more easily. It is disappointing that even though this product costs about the same as the previous DVD sets, not only are you getting less content, but you are also getting a lower-quality package.

Of course, what matters most is the show itself, and it is as epic and entertaining as ever. So while the absence of bonus material is disappointing, it's a relatively small complaint. The bottom line is if you liked the episodes featured in the previous DVD sets, you will probably like the episodes in this volume as well. Definitely check out this DVD set if you like Gargoyles.",1493683200,3,2103,4.6353887399463805

3425176,5,B00198X0YA,"I remember watching Gargoyles as a kid in the 90's and being so disappointed when it was cancelled (so was my mom, who watched it with me). When I was in high school, my parents bought me Season 1 and Season 2, Volume 1. I couldn't believe that Disney neglected to release Volume 2! I happened to check for Volume 2 recently and discovered that they finally DID release it! I still love the characters and they really changed up their method of story telling in Vol. 2. I'd like to note that the 5 star rating goes toward the show only. Disney did a horrible job packaging the discs, setting them right on top of each other. I'll find a more suitable DVD case that allows for multiple holders for the discs. Also, the discs have the plainest label Disney could come up with. If I didn't enjoy the show so much, I would take off a star.",1473897600,3,835,4.2578616352201255

Only downside is that the packaging styles for Vol1 and Vol2 are different.  My Vol1 is ""thicker"" and thus larger than the standard dvd case-sized Vol2, so can't place them both in a ""holder"" as Vol1 won't fit even if I toss the outer sleeve.

Still, glad to finally have Vol2.  Wonder if (a legit) Season 3 will ever see the light of day, as I hear it was later deemed non-cannon in some circles.  :)",1471996800,2,482,4.359550561797753
3425182,4,B00198X0YA,"Season 2, Volume 2 continues the ""Gargoyles World Tour"" as well as offering a wonderful three-part conclusion. Disney has never released season 3 (which was re-titled ""Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles"") on DVD, and it's for the best. This season offers an emotionally satisfying wrap-up to the series, while open-ended enough that Greg Weisman could later return and write a comics follow-up. My only complaint about this is the packaging, which is relatively cheap and doesn't offer the best protection for the discs.

Now Season 2 -Vol 2 menu presentation was done on the run (unlike the other 2 previous collections). Not even mention the jewel case that have staked the 3 DVD's in the same pin, one over the other. That was a cheap approach. Seems that Disney, once again, took advantage of the fans who bough the previous 2 releases and ""threw this one and ran away"".",1469923200,,556,4.450980392156863

This time, team leader Goliath (Keith David) and his lady friend Elisa have discovered a lost colony of gargoyles on the otherworldly Island of Avalon. Now reunited with his long-lost daughter, Angela, they've hit a snag when it's time to go home (Avalon doesn't send you where you want to go, but where you are needed). Now the team must go on a globe-trotting quest, ""Quantum Leap""-style, to get back to New York. The Writers went all out on this season, scouring the mythologies of the world for adventures, everything from the Pacific Northwest to Loch Ness, West Africa, the Australian Outback, Easter Island, a guest appearance by King Arthur himself, and even time travel to participate in the Battle of Britain, all leading up to an all-or-nothing duel on the streets of New York with the near-omnipotent Elder God, Oberon.

This was a great way to wrap up the series (a short-lived sequel: ""The Goliath Chronicles"", was released a year later, but was unpopular with the fans and was cancelled by the network soon after). Although I am disappointed that the entire series wasn't released on DVD in a box set rather than in installments, this show is without a doubt #3 on my all-time best American-made cartoon series list, coming close behind ""Batman: the Animated Series"" and  ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"".

It is the final 26 episodes of season 2.  This made tons of fans of the show, myself included, extremely happy to finally get a copy.  Better late than never.  Whether they're the uncut episodes, I'm unsure, but it's nice to have the complete seasons one and two sitting gingerly on my shelf.

Now, the somewhat upsetting things about this set.  No idea why the previous sets were chock-full of features (behind the scenes, commentary tracks, introductions to each episode with the show's creators, etc.), but not this one.  And the other upsetting thing: the set came with the DVD's stacked on top of each other on one disc holder.  I replaced the case with one that could hold three discs on their own disc holder.

Overall, it's a decent set if you just want the final 26 episodes to complete your series thus far.

I have a feeling, however, that we may never see season three get a DVD release.",1457308800,,1158,4.541062801932367

3425215,5,B00198X0YA,"I wanted to let the buyer know, that yes this is the long awaited volume 2 of season 2 ... BUT.. and it's a big one...
This only takes the series up to the last few episodes where it changed from 'Gargoyles' to 'Gargoyles the Goliath Chronicles' which was the last season of the show.
So the series is still not finished yet. They need to come out with an additional volume with the 'Goliath Chronicles' on it.
So this volume takes you through the rest of the 'Avalon' trials and their return home but not the last episodes of the ""Goliath Chronicles'
Which made me sad.  So I'm still hoping Disney finishes this series out. If not in another volume  maybe they'll give us the full series on blu ray.
All in all though, it's still one of my favorite animated series and you can't go wrong with it.
The two best animated series of the 90's (in my opinion) were Gargoyles, and Batman the animated series.  You can't go wrong with either one.

The other two volumes of Gargoyles (Season 1 and Season 2, Part One) have each disc stored individually, opening and closing like a book. Not sure why this wasn't considered an option.

I am glad it is available because of the fact this show was amazing when it first came out. Very interesting characters, stories, myth and legends, and settings.

I won't go into the story of the series just cause if you're looking at buying this you probably have already seen or know about it.

So this DVD set isn't that great ill admit it. The main reason it is getting a good review from me is just for the fact we finally have it. Most companies from the 90's never seem to want to release their series on DVD or re-release it on DVD (before being only VHS).

The DVD's are bare bones. Barely anything to them other then some trailers for other shows.

Other then that, there is just a play all button, or episode selection. It could have been even more bare bones (like some DVD sets iv seen in the past) but I am just surprised they didn't include anymore behind the scenes stuff. But just be glad they released the DVD's themselves otherwise we might have never gotten them till say 50  years from now when most of the cast or creators would have passed away or something.",1447200000,,1216,4.31140350877193

3425248,5,B00198X0YA,"...we often find ourselves disappointed.  We discover that those wonderful things we grew up with aren't quite as great as we remembered them.  Sometimes, the quality is a bit below our recall.  Sometimes, we find that what we thought was so great was, in fact, a travesty, breaking our hearts.  Fortunately, this is not always the case, and Gargoyles is a fine example of childhood memories standing the test of time.  The writing, the drama, the attention to detail, is all as fantastic as I remember it being in the 90s.  Goliath, Eliza, and Bronx have left Avalon, accompanied by the gargoyle youth Angela, and have embarked on a quest that takes them across the world before finally returning to Manhattan.  Upon returning, the gargoyles begin to understand their place in the modern world, and the series takes the unexpectedly mature perspective that nobody is truly evil and even the worse villains can become heroes as we see Xanatos changed by love and family, and we see him reconcile with Goliath.

In addition to being a great action show, it also introduces children to Shakespeare, Arthurian and Celtic/Brittonic mythology, and also teaches peace instead of violence as a preferred resolution to conflict.  The show also isn't afraid to kill characters, even if the production is afraid to actually is afraid to show onscreen death (two notable exceptions, the rather epic death of a secondary villain and the heroic and selfless death of a secondary hero, being in the same episode...there's a bit of a symbology with this one, especially since the characters that died not only were each others enemies, but had also been master and apprentice).  Gargoyles is one of the most underrated, really great shows of the 90s.

The only problem I have, is that unlike the previous volumes in the collection, Season 2, Volume 2 drastically cuts down on features, offering no bonus content except possibly a few commentaries, but this is a small complaint compared to the show itself.",1439510400,,1991,4.948948948948949

3425276,3,B00198X0YA,"Wish I could give separate ratings...
Actual content of Gargoyles season 2 part 2= 5 stars.
Extra features= 0 stars. There are no extra features.
Quality/packaging= 0 stars. The 3 discs come stacked one of top of the other on one spindle (so if you, for example, want to watch an episode on the last disc, you have to work all three off of the inconvenient spindle in order to do so). There is no DVD guide or any other explanatory insert. Also (perhaps a nitpick), the sound and image quality on the DVD menu is terrible.

I'm so excited to finally be able to own an official copy of the episodes I know and continue to love, but I really wish someone at Disney still cared about the product they present. It's obvious from this DVD that Disney no longer expects to make good money off of their DVD releases and it just turning them out as cheaply as possible. There aren't any advertisements when you put the disc in; it goes straight to the DVD menu. Any extras that may have required thought or money are nonexistent. The DVD doesn't even have a menu option for Setup.
When first hearing about this release I was somewhat perplexed as to why this show wasn't packaged as full season 2 release, or a collector's edition, as others have suggested, because as a fan I would have paid more to get a quality product. But on seeing this DVD it's obvious that Disney is just releasing its older shows to shut people up and maybe get some pocket change out of it. They don't care, and that's a shame because this is a really clever show with a strong fan following.
Starting with ""Monsters,"" this collection contains all episodes though the end of season 2 multiparter ""Hunter's Moon.""

3425297,3,B00198X0YA,"I was very excited when I saw that season 2 vol 2 was released on DVD. So excited that I bought both vol. 1 and 2 since I'd been holding out on one. I have not actually watched the discs yet so this review will be updated later with that aspect. When both sets arrived, I opened them up to look inside. Vol. 1 is a love letter to Gargoyles. Colorful labels with characters from the show featured prominently. An introduction from Greg Weisman. The box art shows Goliath in a little too much shadow, but Demona looks fantastic. The only thing I didn't like is that Disc 1 covers disc 2 and must be removed in order to get to the second disc.

Now I had been warned through previous reviews that Vol. 2 was very bare bones, but I was shocked by just how bare it was. The cover art may as well have been ripped right from the season 1 box art which wasn't all that impressive either. There is no label art on the discs and 'Disney DVD' is much bigger than the name of the show. I don't know about you but I think the title deserves top billing. As previously mentioned, all three discs are on one holster.

There's something else I don't think has been mentioned yet. On the back, it says and I quote ""Join the epic struggle between good and evil as Gotham's guardians return to save humanity from the clutches of the world's most maniacal monsters."" That's not from Amazon, that's from the back of the DVD case. What's wrong with it? If you don't know, you're not a Gargoyles fan. But you may be a fan of BATMAN. The Gargoyles do not reside in Gotham. They live in Manhattan. BATMAN lives in Gotham! *screams and throws things* Ok, I'm cool, I'm fine. So since Disney doesn't want to do this right, I'll do it. I bought a multi disc DVD case capable of holding six discs and when it arrives I'll put all the discs in one package. I'll keep the vol. 1 case and chuck the vol. 2 case in the trash where it belongs.

I'm glad Disney finally released vol. 2 but I am disheartened at the effort Disney expended on this. Compared to vol. 1 and even season 1, this looks like something someone just tossed together and said ""There, that oughta keep the fans happy and we didn't have to spend any money to do it.""

If you're a fan of Gargoyles, please buy the set, but demand better from Disney. Demand the love letter it deserves. Demand that the cast be allowed to do audio commentaries. (And closed caption the commentary audio and not just the main episode audio.) Tell them that while we love Gargoyles and will support the show, we expect better. We deserve better.",1422576000,,2561,4.296066252587992

The episodes are still wonderful but now I have a greater appreciation because I am grown so I am looking at these characters with a different lens. I loved every moment. If I could give one critique is that unlike the other volumes there is no directors cut or creator insight on the episodes. I really valued that bit of extra information and to see their intention and feeling of the show progression. But, if all you want and need is the gargoyles you know and love and revisit fond memories this will not disappoint. You will applaud at the end. PLEASE DISNEY KEEP RELEASING THE REST!!

Course everyone knows about Japanese anime, but if you are in Japan, living off a base in the local community, and all the anime you get is only in Japanese, if you find any English speaking shows you watch them.  That's how I started watching these.  Trouble is, after a couple of the shows, you are hooked.  The storyline remained great, from start to finish.  You have ancient settings all the way forward to futuristic ones.  Weapons, equipment, it's all there to unlock the story and take it forward.  My only fault is that it's not on Blu-ray--hopefully one day it will be--and I'll go out and buy that also!  I just purchased a 4K television and can't wait to watch older DVD's, especially animated ones, to see how upsampling does.  I look at the Gargoyles as more of a cartoon for teens on up.  Children would have trouble following the story-lines.  I keep saying this over and over, but it seems like AMAZON is the source to go to at finding movies or t.v. shows no one else carries...to include the large retail stores sitting on every street block.

3425337,5,B00198X0YA,"With no warning and zero fanfare, it would appear that the second half of Gargoyles: Season Two has finally been released on DVD. Hallelujah! Encompassing fifty-two episodes in all,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-first-half-of-season-two/dp/B000ATQYVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the first half of season two</a>&nbsp;was released way back in 2005, though its relatively low sales meant that Disney was in no hurry to reward desperate fans with the next half (at least that was their excuse).

During its run back in the nineties, ""Gargoyles"" picked up a strong cult following, with viewers attracted to its dark tone, complex story-arcs, three-dimensional characters and strong grasp of continuity. Combining everything from Shakespearean characters to Machiavellian billionaires to Arthurian legend, ""Gargoyles"" was consistently surprising in its depth of plot and maturity of themes.

The gist of the premise is that sentient, vaguely humanoid creatures known as gargoyles once lived alongside humans in the distant past. One such clan, which protected a castle in Scotland, were betrayed by the humans they had sworn to protect and frozen in stone by a magic spell. A thousand years later they are reawakened in modern-day New York, bewildered by the new technology and unsure who to trust.

Their leader Goliath befriends detective Elisa Maza, who becomes the clan's secret liaison with the outside world, encouraging them to protect the city from its foes. And foes there are plenty, from the rouge gargoyle Demona who plots to eradicate all of humankind, to the billionaire entrepreneur David Xanatos, unceasing in his attempts to accumulate more power and exploit the gargoyles to his own ends.

These episodes begin halfway through what fans have nicknamed the ""Avalon World Tour"", in which Goliath, Elisa, Bronx and Goliath's newfound daughter Angela depart the mystical isle of Avalon only to find that the sentient island has other plans for them (this was well before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LOST/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LOST</a>, mind you). Instead of returning home to Manhattan, the four of them are transported to various locations around the world, awakening heroes and defending innocents from various threats, collecting hints along the way that a mysterious event known as the Gathering is scheduled to occur on Avalon at some point in the near future.

It includes some of my favourite episodes, such as ""The Hound of Ulster"" and ""The Mark of the Panther"", set in Ireland and Nigeria respectively, both with stunning animation and creative use of each country's folklore. As the Avalon World Tour winds up, we're treated to ""Ill Met By Moonlight"" in which Lord Oberon and Queen Titania return to their mystical island to demand the removal of the humans and gargoyles that dwell there. In a bid to allow the clan to stay, Goliath challenges Oberon to a duel across the island's terrain - but they may have unexpected help from his queen.

Later, the two-part episode ""The Gathering"" deals with a surprising twist in the Xanatos family. With the birth of his young son, David Xanatos calls on the help of the gargoyles to keep his family safe from the unexpected interest of Lord Oberon. These episodes contain not one but *two* dramatic reveals of characters that have gone about in elaborate disguises and under false identities for some time, providing pay-off to hints and foreshadowing that stretch back as far as the inception of the show.

Finally, the magnificent three-part ""Hunter's Moon"" returns to what is perhaps the show's most tragic plot-line: the animosity between gargoyles and humans, as encapsulated in the vendetta that exists between Demona and the Hunters, a family of warriors that devote their lives to hunting her down. With his loved ones caught in the crossfire, Goliath is first desperate to stop the fighting, before he himself is struck with the desire for vengeance. It's beautiful storytelling, with a devastating line delivered at its climax (""what have I... what have *they* done?!"") that will sent long-time viewers into spasms of delight at how poignantly it echoes an identical line said by a completely different character in frighteningly similar circumstances much earlier in the show's run. Like I said, these writers had an impeccable grasp of continuity.

Regarding the DVD itself, there is little in the way of extras. The last DVD set contained several fun extras, including introductions to each episode by co-creator Greg Weisman (who still runs a blog that allows fans to ask him questions about the show) though here it's simply the episodes with no extra frills. It's disappointing, but hardly surprising - and after this long, I'm just happy to finally have them on DVD.

As it stands, there's still one more season of ""Gargoyles"" to be released after this, though it's considered discontinuity by fans due to its fall in quality and the departure of co-creator Greg Weisman (in his comic book series he ignores all but the first episode of season three and strikes out on his own). So for all intents and purposes, my ""Gargoyles"" DVD collection is complete. It feels great to finally have the whole set - and I can't wait until my nephew is old enough for me to share it with him.

Beautiful animation, complex story-lines, lovable characters and talented voice-acting - this is everything I love to watch on television.",1394409600,5,5509,5.343713956170704
3425338,4,B00198X0YA,"I just found out this week that Gargoyles Season 2, Vol. 2 was even available. I don't need to go into details about the show 'cause other reviewers pretty much covered all the bases; however, there is some tension from others about the price offered. I personally was guided by a couple of reviewers towards DisneyStore.com and the most I paid was $26.40 tax included, at least with ""my"" state tax. But I was tempted to pay the outlandish price, only because had no previous experience dealing with Disney online. But in the spirit of understanding I believe, but could be wrong, that the sellers on Amazon could have only procured their new copies from the same source I did. And how can a business profit if they don't aim higher than what they paid. That aside, if the Amazon sellers soon become the only source for whatever reason than the price will really jump so choose wisely and quickly. Because if Disney sales aren't to their satisfaction and they eventually sale out, they might not see the profit in manufacturing more.",1393113600,,1033,4.681318681318682

3425341,4,B00198X0YA,"Even now this series stands as an impressive feet of complex and more adult minded story telling while still being freely accessible to younger viewers. I loved it in my youth and I still love it now. It was a long time waiting for this final installment of the proper series (there was a 3rd season dubbed ""The Goliath Chronicles,"" but creator Greg Weisman has disowned those episodes.)

Firstly it should be noted that these are the episodes only and that's in. There are no special features of any kind. No commentaries, no behind the scenes featurettes, no intros to the episodes, not even animated menus. But given how long fans had to wait for this, most will be plenty pleased with the episodes on their own.

The quality of the voice acting, animation and story telling remains intact from the earlier installments. Personally though this is not my favorite block of episodes. Beginning with the ""world tour,"" much of this collection is about opening up the world of Gargoyles and making it bigger. For me it did that a little too well. The world becomes so big that it makes the gargoyles themselves seem smaller and somehow a little less important or significant versus how it felt in earlier episodes. This is really just a personal preference for the more contained episodes of the first season and first have of Season 2.

First, there was an unreasonably long wait between the release of volume 1 and volume 2.  Despite the long wait, on volume 2 gives every appearance that it was produced as a rush job.  There is nothing wrong with the episodes themselves, but all the frills you'd normally expect with a DVD release are missing.  Compared to volume 1, the packaging is sub par, the DVD artwork is weak, the menus are bland, and the special features are almost nonexistent.

This is the only legal way to enjoy the last half season 2 so if you want to see the episodes, get the DVD set.  If you fancy yourself a collector though, this DVD set will disappoint you.",1378771200,2,805,4.3624161073825505

There's no special features, which was a bit of a disappointment, but the episodes appear all uncut with excellent audio/pic quality, and subtitles for those with hard of hearing, so I can't complain!

All that's missing is season 3, but to be frank I couldn't care less about that season. Greg Weisman didn't work on it, except the first episode, so it is basically crap.

One little thing I should point out is the cover-art for the DVD casing. Both Broadway and Brooklyn (the red and aquamarine ones) appear to be missing their wings???",1377129600,2,643,4.723214285714286

I asked TVShowsOnDVD about it and this was their response ""Thanks, we've been well aware of this for a long time now, but our site policy is to never cover items you need a membership to buy (ex: Disney Movie Club's Gargoyles, Talespin, Goof Troop, Weekenders, Kim Possible."". Apparently they knew about this release for a long time and didn't bother to mention it. I don't know about anyone else, but that makes me mad. How are we supposed to buy a release if we don't know it is out. Amazon gives us some releases that we can ask to be notified, but not all. I want to finish the Ducktales and Darkwing Duck Series, but there is nowhere on Amazon to be notified and if they come out this way TVShowsOnDVD won't tell us. I didn't even know the rest of Talespin had been released. There should be better advertising for shows that are released  for Disney Movie Club because they will eventually make it to Amazon and Ebay. Gargoyles: Season Two Vol. 2 I bought at Ebay $25.90, only because Amazon.con alerted me that it had been released. I wasn't alerted until July 30th and I was in shock and disbelief at first. I hope for the Goliath Chronicles, and the rest of Ducktales and Darkwing Duck. And Gummi Bears too. If they do come out I hope for better advertising.",1375228800,2,1498,4.427536231884058

However my question is don't you think 70.00 is a bit much for this economy? I spend 40.00 at the most for a new season of whatever. A smart investor would make the price more reasonable and make more seasons and advertise and different sites to get better profit. Obviously you can do this or you wouldn't be selling it in the first place. Please considered!,1375056000,2,465,4.482352941176471
3425369,4,B00198X0YA,"I've waited a long time for someone at Disney to wise up and finish the rest of (at least) Season 2. The series itself is great with a wonderful blend of action, humor and drama. The actors make the roles their own. Few shows are made like this anymore (or they are, and get cancelled by morons).

However, buyer take heed: Don't get so desperate to get this that you jump at the first opportunity. Some people are pricing this too high. I picked mine up on eBay for $24.99 (Buy It Now with free shipping, so it balanced out nicely), so don't be afraid to shop around and compare prices.

As for the DVDs themselves, I've yet to actually play the episodes, but I did pop the discs in briefly to check the menus. Each disc has a main menu with the same basic background, but the characters change. You can select the episodes individually or hit Play All. That's it. No special features or commentaries or anything (which I suspected when I checked around online and found show co-creator Greg Weisman was just as surprised as any given Gargoyles fan that the rest of Season 2 was being released). But, hey, it got released and that's a triumph in and of itself, right?

Now, here's what irks me straight to all get-out: This set has three discs, and one...ONE holster. They made the disc crevasse deep enough so that it can hold all three with a single peg, but they're stacked on top one another. This led me to worry that over time, the discs would become scratched. This is to say nothing of when I wanted to watch the middle or bottom disc, having to pop out more than I needed, and...well, long story short, it's a bit of a hassle. However, it's a hassle Disney could've easily avoided if they bothered to spring an extra dime to get DVD cases with a hinged panel that could hold a disc on each side.

Since Disney chose not to do this, I went to eBay and picked up a 3-disc DVD case for a couple bucks. This is why I gave a four-star rating for a five-star show: I have to include the mistakes made when this set was put together. I can understand not bothering to add in special features, but three discs in one holster? Yeah, that's ridiculous.",1374969600,108,2152,4.345771144278607
3425371,5,B00198X0YA,This series is offered by disney movie club for little over twenty bucks. They also officially sell this dvd set on a very large marketplace that you would go to buy and sell new and used treasures.,1373846400,23,198,4.378378378378378

3425373,5,B00198X0YA,"It's true! Season 2, Part 2 is now available as an exclusive release on Disney Movie Club. It retails for $19.99 for 3-discs, 26 episodes, and due to following the ""Exclusive"" DMC line trend, it is in a yellow box that does not match Part 1. If you are not a member of the club, most exclusives are not searchable until you are. If you search the site for Gargoyles and it doesn't come up, that doesn't mean they don't sell it.

Before becoming a member, search the web for the best invite codes. When you go to the site, the invite you get is random. There are much, MUCH better deals that will reduce the number of DVDs/BluRay you have to buy. The code I used made it so I got (I believe) 6 DVDs free and only had to buy 1 at $17, and 2 at retail ($20-30) to complete my obligation. Then I kept the club just in case they released something else I needed! May I suggest picking up other exclusives to round out your collection, like Kim Possible Seasons 1 and 2, DuckTales the Movie, TaleSpin vol 3, and more?

Or you can wait for the resellers. It'll probably be around $40-60 as that is what other DMC exclusives go for. (UPDATE Feb 2014: Now that there are more available it's around $25-35. See below!)

UPDATE: I've received my copy from DMC. There are NO extra features. Includes 26 episodes (approx. 9.71 hours/595 mins of content) through episode #52, in fullscreen (like the original), English 2.0 Dolby, ""Color/Digitally Remastered."" There is no insert. It is a single DVD case with the three discs in one tray inside. It's a very bare-bones presentation, but at least we have it now!

UPDATE FEB 2014: Gargoyles 2.2 is now listed available online through the Disney Store website for $19.99 + $5 shipping. I haven't ordered one myself, but it shows the same cover as the DMC website. No other DMC exclusives are listed as yet.",1372118400,35,1839,4.448071216617211

I am a newcomer to the Gargoyle world but i already LOVE it. If this really is legit, i won't have to reduce myself to watching the remaining episodes on youtube! YAY!

My friend got me into Gargoyles about a year ago, but i THINK i used to watch it when I was little: i think a few cobwebs are taking up that space in my filing cabinet:P
I love the characters, especially Goliath (why can't human men be like that?) and I love the whole Beauty and the Beast angle to it. Also, Keith David's voice is to DIE FOR. He's got one of those voices that you can't mistake! I nearly fainted when I heard him doing the badguy on Princess and the Frog...Singing (then i got a crazy mental image of Goliath singing and dancing as well!)
As well as this season 2 part 2 (HOPEFULLY coming out) i wish Disney would do a movie based on the series...I'm not sure how they'd do it...but maybe I just was me some more Goliath....hehe!

I'm in my mid twenties and I still go back to re-watch Gargoyles - and I always considered the later half of Season two as some of the best shows they came up with. It was so consistent! The plot of the show was universal enough that anyone could identify with it; and the sub-plots were just as good - and they referred  back to them! The show didn't throw aside a one-episode story, they often would mention it later even 10 or 20 episodes in the future - if not expanding upon it. I loved that. There was a HISTORY to the show. Nothing cancelled each other out, it only added to the characters and the background, and made the stories grew and made the show so much more fulfilling in the process. As a cartoon aimed at 7-12 year old boys, it somehow attracted a much broader crowd than its targeted audience. I was about 12 years old when it first aired and as a girl, I was absolutely fascinated by everything the show gave. I would sneak out of bed almost nightly to watch the show when it aired late several years after it was cancelled. That's how much this show came to mean to me.

It's history, it's code of conduct, even the hints of how life will not be kind but you can always overcome it if you try hard and look forward instead of back made me want to be noble like these made up characters - because they were more real than some people I knew. There just wasn't anything like it on the air at the time, and it was so deep and meaningful that it stood out to me and so many others.

When will these companies learn that people are FRUSTRATED with DVD box sets that FAIL to release the ENTIRE series OR, upon spending the money to buy season by season, the buggers release a COMPLETE series boxset that's cheaper and extra fancy. Due to YOUR stupidity, companies, people are not wanting to be jerked around and so they WAIT for you to release the ENTIRE series before they start buying....and meanwhile, you morons are waiting for sales on your single (or a scattering of seasons) to sell well enough to release the series.

Why can't old shows just release complete boxsets from day one? Then everyone wins.

This is a game of stalemate and no one is winning.

Cutting off ""Gargoyles"" fans on DVD JUST as the Avalon world tour is starting is just plain cruel. You wonder why people download: it's the only way they can get their shows!",1303257600,3,1077,4.62303664921466

That it was unfair of Disney to put out season one and half of season two, and not release the rest of season two and all of season three.  I hope the release of these two DVD's is for real, so all us fans of the Gargoyles series can watch and actually finish what we're watching and be satisfied.  But I'm not here to repeat what everyone else has been saying, I personally think that due to the great success of the Gargoyles series, that Disney should bring Gargoyles back and at least create a season four for us die hard fans, and the new generation of kids to keep the Gargoyles legacy alive.",1294704000,4,664,4.253968253968254

3425427,4,B00198X0YA,"In these episodes of Gargoyles, the Avalon travelers continue to be exposed to different legendary and mythological figures as they travel the world to return to Manhattan, while Goliath and Angela deal with the obvious ramifications of her physical appearance that won't have escaped any fans.

If memory serves (and it's been a long time), highlights of this volume, if it's ever released, should also include the end of the animosity between Fox and Lexington after the birth of her child, who turns out to be a little boy named Alex to whom Lex becomes a deeply devoted uncle figure and who clearly adores Lex in turn once he becomes old enough to be aware of his presence.  Alex would become not only the light of Lexington's life, but a ray of sunshine for fans as we watched him grow into a toddler conditioned to Gargoyles as a normal part of his world.  There would also be some very...interesting developments concerning Puck, who makes several return appearances following his debut in ""The Mirror"", and it would be the Midsummer Night's Dream faeries who would be the subject of this set's multi-episode arc ""The Gathering"".  I still remember grinning madly at the little curveball he threw the viewership and feeling bad for him after what subsequently happened.

Unfortunately, sales for Season 2 Part 1 were bad enough to discourage Disney from releasing Part 2.  All we can do is buy our copies of the two existing sets to indicate our support and express our interest by hitting that release notification button offered by Amazon.  Hopefully generated interest will be relayed to the powers that be at Disney.  With Gargoyles now hard to find on TV, it deserves a full release as one of the best animated series of the 1990s.

Update:  Disney has released this as a Movie Club exclusive.  Therefore, if you see any copies for sale, they are likely legitimate and you should probably buy the copy if it comes up, depending on what the seller is demanding and how much you are willing to pay for it.",1286150400,4,2014,4.742120343839542

Season Two holds episode's some of my favourite episodes such as 'Possessed', 'Future Tense' and the 'Hunter's Moon' three parter which was a great way to end the series. The second half of season two has made me laugh, cry until it hurt and had me on the edge of the seat.

3425431,1,B00198X0YA,"Just to make it clear, it's 5 stars for the Gargoyles Animated Series itself, especially Season 2 and ZERO stars for Disney for not releasing and selling Volume 2 of Season 2 to complete the set almost 5 years after the initial release of Season 2 Volume 1. =/

Gargoyles Season 1, introduces the ""players"" and sets the tone for the series, while Season 2 expands the series and the evolves characters within to heights not typically seen in in your typical animated series, with deep character development and expanded story arcs. Watching the series a second or third time you begin to catch subtle hints that lead to huge revelations several episodes down the line that you wouldn't necessarily have caught in the first viewing. That is one of the great measures of a top quality series.

Gargoyles - Season Two should have been sold as one big collector's set instead of being split into two separate volumes. It's crazy that fans of one of the best quality Western animated series have to be ""teased"" by a Season 1 DVD and only half of Season 2. We would have easily paid the extra money for the larger, more complete set.

I'm sure Disney has already made plenty from the sales of Season 1 and Season 2 Vol 1. It stands to reason that they will make just as much if not more by offering to the Volume 2 set to complete Season 2.

Hell, I would have gladly put even more money down for the complete ""Collector's Edition"" series with Seasons 1, 2 and 3 all bundled into one package.

I don't know why they make fans wait so long to complete a show, I heard for Gargoyles it would take about 1,000 more sets sold and that was some years back, surely that many sets have been sold. What about Ducktales, only one volume was left and they stopped it, after 3 years of putting out a set and I know Ducktales sold very well, it's like they don't think of the fans some times, whoever is in charge of the 80s and 90s shows decision making needs to go and get someone in there who actually had love and care for these shows. Though BCI is gone, they released almost every filmation show ever done, with extras and even completed shows on dvd that were not hot sellers, now what about Disney? Are you gonna leave your fans in the cold and just go onto the next show that ties into a movie, they are lots of money spending fans from the earlier series than just the more recent shows airing nowadays.",1262649600,8,1085,4.297560975609756

Thank goodness they are considering finishing the second half.  Season two was the best season, at the top of its game--gripping, dazzling, I wished it had been a novel to read again and again.  The writers were absolute genious on this one.  What a well thought out story arch!  Pity we only have half...  (Disney bleeps!!!)

From looking over these reviews, and just by seeing how many true die-hard Gargoyles fans are out there you KNOW these dvds sold well enough. And even if the didn't, they're DISNEY! They can definitely afford to just put out another little box set.

It's not like they even have to put out the third season at all--no ones asking for that! (blech, third season was awful, being non-canon)

I'm aware S2, V1 did not sell initially to expectations, but surely those who did delightfully find then buy copies of the first two DVD releases highly await the prospect of completing season 2.  I missed parts of the latter half of season 2 when it originally aired so I think I might have not seen parts of season 2's hunter's moon.  I distinctly recall the showdown between the alliance of humans and gargoyles against Oberon and his children.  Gargoyles from the very beginning had me hooked and still to this day I'm an avid fan.  As I noted in another review probably the one on Season 1.  To again hear the music alone still gives me chills occasionally though it certainly did when I inserted the first disc of Season 1 to watch Awakening in the five separate parts rather than the cut and edited together telefilm version of Awakening.

Both versions have merit though with the ownership of S1 10th anniversary copy I have grown more fond of the multi-parter version of Awakening.  Many episodes were stand out takes like Enter Macbeth, which fueled my interest in what exactly ensured Demona's survival when we were initially led to believe she died with the others at Wyvern thanks to Hakon.  As many fans probably noticed even now that so much of what happens in series ties back to the Wyvern Massacre of 994.

At any rate, I sincerely hope to own the other half of season two in time because I know at night I am not alone in looking for signs that our appreciation and faith in the Gargoyles is not misplaced.  Likewise those of you who have seen it likely have the DVDs and well those who have not take a chance, you never you could like this show too.",1247788800,7,1777,4.46749226006192

3425449,5,B00198X0YA,"Gargoyles defined my childhood. I LOVED this series then and now watching them as an adult I have realized that I had impeccable taste even at the tender age of 11. It's a cartoon that has themes that are universal to all ages centering on prejudice, love, and the downfalls of hate. It was even my introduction to Shakespeare and inspired me to read the works that were referenced in Gargoyles when I was in middle school. It is truly an educational series with a fantastic plot and fabulous story telling.

Furthermore, Season 2 volume 2 would contain, in my opinion, the best episodes of the series. The entire Avalon world tour, The Gathering, and Hunter's Moon were some of my favorite episodes and I would love to be able to own them on DVD. If you thought that Season 2 Volume 1 was good, it just gets better from there. And for those of you that have never seen Gargoyles before, I guarantee that if you enjoy cartoons at all, you will love this series.

I realize that Disney has said that Gargoyles suffered from poor sales, but I fail to see how their release of Gummie Bears, Darkwing Duck, DuckTales, or TaleSpin would prove any better. While I also loved these series as a child, Gargoyles has a fanbase that has been unwavering for almost 15 years. There are fans out there, like myself, that have never even attended The Gathering and may not be aware that Gargoyles is out on DVD at all. I was lucky enough to randomly type it into Amazon one day, but others may need a gentle reminder. I believe with basic advertisement for the release of Season 2 Volume 2, those fans would come out of the woodwork and sales would climb for all of the seasons.

I am hoping that this is the truth, that the second chapter of the season is going to be released.  It has been a pleasure for me to travel down the road of the characters again, and remember their journeys and to see how they have grown and changed.  I hope that when my niece gets older, I can share the Gargoyles with her as well.

I've checked various websites (such as Wikipedia) and they continue to insist that the other volumes have been axed with no plans of a release. The same has been with Family Matters; it's been posted for as long as I can remember on Amazon, but no release date ever given. I'm only saying this because it seems a lot of people are holding out for hope, and I certainly was one of them, but I'm not holding my breath anymore. 5 stars for the show, 0 stars for Disney's efforts.",1223856000,3,676,4.504065040650406

3425506,5,B00198X0YA,"Three Words: Avalon. World. Tour.

Any fan of ""The Disney Afternoon"" knew of Gargoyles. Any fan of Gargoyles- and there are enough to hold a full fledged convention for it EVERY YEAR- knows exactly what I mean by those three words. Season one was fantastic, introduced a myriad of great characters, and started the best animated show ever to hit the air (sorry Avatar. I still love you.). Season two, however, was PHENOMINAL. More characters and character development. Fantastic stories. It was a quality show and deserves all the praise that is lovingly thrown at its deserving feet. I love cartoons. This one was my favorite.

Putting out Season Two, Volume one was great- but making us wait so long for Volume Two? SHAME ON YOU DISNEY. I'm just glad you realized your mistake. I cannot WAIT to see this on the shelves, because as SOON as it's available for preorder, I will be one of the first to pick it up.

Huzzah for the best season of the best show!",1222387200,2,957,4.584795321637427

3425508,5,B00198X0YA,"Disney, Disney, Disney...  What's it going to take, guys?  Have you not seen the internet consumer response to the want/need of this product?  You release the entire Gummi Bears series on DVD, but you won't finish Gargoyles?  Seriously?

Open your eyes... this is an exact reflection of the energy crisis. lol  The majority of the American people want to be energy independent and to drill for oil to bring gas prices down... but Congress wants to take a 5 week vacation?  C'mon... you're better than that!  Release this... allow us to spend our money on you... allow us to stimulate the economy in our own way. ;]

Oh, and for those of you that are reading this for the review?  Absolutely worth the 5 stars.  In the first volume of season 2, you saw the beginnings of the entire Avalon story.  It only gets better from that point and the fact that they're keeping this sucker from us is pure evil.  If you want some deep story telling appropriate for all ages, while challenging children on the issues of morality and the unknown, then grab this up whenever and wherever you can.

Mythology, magic/sorcery, medieval times clashing with modern day, Arthurian legend come to life... it has it all, while sporting some of the best animation of its time (and even today).

Update 4/11/13:

I came back here checking for updates and saw the cover art in the picture area.  That obviously got my blood pumping, but who knows what it ""really"" means.  Anyway, after having read a few more reviews/comments, I decided to do a little research.

In my research, I found Disney's online streaming service (which is free) and has all of the episodes of Gargoyles Season 1-3.  I know that's not what we want, but it's something, right?  (I posted the URL, but Amazon deleted it - probably because they have their own screening service.  Just search for it and I'm sure you can find it.)

Otherwise, I decided to contact Disney with a surprisingly long e-mail (I hadn't realized that I had so much to say about this show - lol).  I'm hopeful that I'll get a response with some answers.  If not, at least I tried.  I'll update this review as soon as I have something/anything to update with.

Update 4/12/13:

Received a seemingly pre-prepared response from Disney.  See below:

I would suggest that anyone who wants to see this product see the light of day that they give Disney an e-mail or call and express to them how much you'd like to purchase it.  Not sure what good it'll do, but it couldn't hurt.  Hopefully Amazon doesn't delete the above phone numbers.",1218153600,2,3632,4.703174603174603

Please release Gargoyles Season 2, Volume 2 on DVD, so that everyone can complete the entire series including me.",1217721600,2,126,5.0476190476190474
3425511,4,B00198X0YA,"Gargoyles season 2 volume 2 contains some of the best stories in the entire series, most notably ""Future Tense"", ""The Gathering"" and the 3-part finale, ""Hunter's Moon.""

The writing and animation are as strong as in the other seasons.  This is Disney at their best!

If you are a fan of mature cartoons like Batman: The Animated Series, than you will LOVE Gargoyles.  Tell Disney it's time to release this classic.",1217635200,2,414,4.788732394366197

The series is making a comeback, in comic book form, and it would be awesome to see the remaining original episodes again.",1216944000,2,248,4.413043478260869
3425513,5,B00198X0YA,"Dear Disney,

What are you waiting for? How can you release Season 2: Volume 1 and not follow it up with Volume 2? You are totally screwing all the fans. In fact, the longer you wait to release these DVDs, the more money you are going to lose. There are plenty of places online to purchase these DVDs. Because Gargoyles is such a great series, I would like to buy the official DVD releases but I am gradually giving up hope that they will ever be released. So I'll have to get the remaining episodes elsewhere.

I wish I could expect more from Disney. But whatever... Disney doesn't even have enough common sense to release season sets of the 90's Spider-man Animated Series or the 90's X-men Animated Series, two other great shows. Along with the Gargoyles, you can buy these sets everywhere online. Obviously there is a demand for them. Wake up Disney and please give us what we want.

Thanks",1216339200,,894,4.506172839506172
