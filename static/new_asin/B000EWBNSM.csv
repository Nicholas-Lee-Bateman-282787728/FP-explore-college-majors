8220295,5,B000EWBNSM,"I really loved this flick.  Definitely aimed at kids, this film has no deep story and no great dialog.  But it does have a load of fun.

Why, oh why, Tom Fahn who plays the genie is listed as a supporting actor when he shares the lead with Matt Koruba is anybody's guess but it's a travesty as Tom is the one and only thing that floats this particular boat.

Grab your kid, some popcorn and soda and enjoy.",1501632000,4,406,4.10126582278481

This is not that film... This one is for the kids almost exclusively.  The acting is at the very least ""O.K.""  The plot is maybe a "" C minus.  Production values ..  sets,  costumes,  film technique,  etc  are "" again""  low budget .",1392422400,4,468,4.3882352941176475
