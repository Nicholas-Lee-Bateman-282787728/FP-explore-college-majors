2763489,4,B000NA6W5Y,"The quality of the DVD isn't very good; however, the DVD isn't a movie it is an exercise video.  The contents of the DVD is about strength fitness exercises with light weights for beginners.  I don't know if it actually promotes weight loss but it is a good starter DVD for people who like me lacked knowledge on how to exercise with weights.  The exercises are fairly easy and if they are not challenging enough you can use heavier weights.  The most difficult exercises are the sit-ups other than that the routine is fairly easy... easy enough for just about anyone to be able to follow regardless of their fitness level.  I am glad that I made the purchase and maybe some day I will graduate to an intermediate level.",1189641600,43,720,4.507692307692308
2763570,4,B000NA6W5Y,Exercises are easy to do and you can increase to heavier weights gradually. The plastered smile throughout the program annoying.,1399420800,,128,5.45
2763571,1,B000NA6W5Y,Really boring awful music. Some of the exercises are really hard for a person my age which is why I bought this. Wasted my money,1397088000,2,128,4.16
2763572,5,B000NA6W5Y,"This DVD has a warm up, 25 minutes weights exercises, cool down and relaxation with nature.

The Exercises are very well done.  She explains and shows the exercise first then she does 2 sets of the exercise.

She has good voice that's easy to understand and hear. She takes you easy step by step. She encourages you to enjoy what your doing, this is not for someone all ready in great shape.

I use 5 lb Weights and can see the difference it made in just a few weeks since I started exercising.  I enjoy the beautiful sunny beach background. I now know the routine so I mute the volume on the Tv and play my own music while I exercise. I truly enjoy the easy simple routine. Recommended.",1389744000,,687,4.294573643410852

2763574,1,B000NA6W5Y,"the exercises were fine BUT the music was horrendous, don't u know that babyboomers were NOT into HEAVY METAL music? that music was so distractiingly nauseous but if i turned it down I couldn't hear the instructions to the exercises, not worth the  $ at all...too bad the music ruined the dvd exercises which were good...",1386028800,2,321,4.732142857142857
2763575,1,B000NA6W5Y,This turned out to be an exact copy of her Fun Beginners DVD with the same exercises switched around. Total waste of money. I don't think I will buy from this person again as they are probably all the same and one can't return them.,1372377600,2,232,4.177777777777778
2763576,3,B000NA6W5Y,"Sunshine does a good job of showing the correct way to do each exercise, but I was a bit confused on part of it when it would skip from the warm ups to suddenly using weights.  There are also places where the amount of reps is not counted correctly.
But all in all, it's a good DVD for just starting out for someone not used to lifting but who needs to get some strength back gradually increasing the amount of weights.",1366329600,3,419,4.172839506172839

2763579,3,B000NA6W5Y,"Cheesy, but some good exercises.  Moves to fast between floor and standing exercises for seniors (my dad) to get into position.  We also didn't recognize that he would need weights until we started viewing it together.",1363651200,3,218,5.027777777777778
2763600,1,B000NA6W5Y,Seemed very uninspiring not much instruction and the music is horrendous.  Had to mute the sound because it was so harsh on the ears,1361404800,3,132,4.5
2763601,5,B000NA6W5Y,"This DVD is unintentionally funny with the strong Jersy accent and perpetual grin of the instructor.  The exercise is for people who are very out of shape and at the very beginning of a weight lifting program.  This was perfect for me, I was able to do all of the exercises and kept up with no problem.  I like the way she shows the exercise first and then does the reps.",1350777600,,371,4.197183098591549
2763602,2,B000NA6W5Y,"So, if you have been having babies, working, and not used to floor exercises and you are close to 60 this is not for you.  I thought maybe most boomers were like me, out of shape.  So I purchased this dvd.  You must have a bench or be able to lay on the floor up and down in about two seconds or you can't keep up.  You also must listen to headbanger music which I don't like.  Parts are good with weights for arms and back but there is no way even using this on a laptop to jump through the exercise to get to an exercise you are interested in.  If you select all and begin with warmsups it doesn't stop untill warmdowns.  You have to be able to put one foot on the floor and another on a bench and lift your heel so if you have arthritus this will not work for you unless you like pain. You also have to stand on one leg and bend the other knee to the floor with weights in both hands.  She has a pasted grin throughtout and there is not one instruction on what weight of dumb bell to use.  If you are out of shape this is not the one to begin with.",1343433600,11,1051,3.8511627906976744
2763603,5,B000NA6W5Y,"As a boomer I wanted to do some easy simple exercise routine with 5 Lb
 dumbbells to stay in shape and maintain my weight.

 This is it. The Exercises are very well explained shown and done at a
 pace easy for me to follow along. There is a warm up, about 25 minutes
 of different exercises with the dumbbells which are done for all the
 muscle groups. She first shows and explains how to do the exercise
 then starts to do 2 sets of 10 times each exercise. It took me a few
 days to get used to the routine now I do both sets easily and feel the
 difference in my strength and endurance. It gets easier with time.

 The DVD is filmed on a nice sunny beach which makes it enjoyable to
 watch. I now listen my own music since I am used to the routine.
 I Recommend it.",1328745600,3,767,4.0
2763604,3,B000NA6W5Y,"I had already bought the Bigginers exercise, bbut since I was a baby boomer, decided to get the Boomer's exercise too.  Unfortunately, they are exactly the same...boo-hoo",1328400000,2,170,5.296296296296297
2763605,2,B000NA6W5Y,"This is supposed to be for Boomers and seniors but how many of us have our own weight benches? The video says you can do these on the floor, but it rushes from one exercise to the next without any break in between, so you have to pause the video, get into position, then unpause it.

Probably my biggest complaint though is the absolutely horrid music played in the background. YIKES! This loud acidy rock is so jarring and discordant that I have to mute the soundt, which means I can't get the instructions.

All in all, I can NOT recommend this exercise video at all and I'm only glad it was cheap.",1327622400,7,600,4.300884955752212
2763606,2,B000NA6W5Y,"Okay, I'm not new to weight lifting, but was looking for a easy/moderate program.  I got this tape a few days ago and did the work out.  Beware it's not a work-out being LEAD by the instructor.  Its one exercise, directly after the other, no time to get down on the floor, or pick up different weghts.  Sunshine and the camera just goes from one scene (and exercise) to the next.  There is NO cohesive element -like an instructor presenting a program.  Its very oddly put together and well I can't recommend it as a ""work-out.""  Its almost disturbing.",1327190400,3,551,4.505050505050505

2763608,2,B000NA6W5Y,"As another reviewer said, THIS IS THE SAME DVD AS THE BEGINNER'S DVD, only different cover and name.  ""Sunshine"" (whoever that really is) is NOT wearing that USA outfit in this DVD.  It really is exactly the same one as the Beginners.

I gave this 2 stars because although the workout is excellent - I felt different and stronger after only doing it 2 times, the company is really horrible for selling the exact same workout with a different label, and ""Sunshine"" in a different outfit on the cover.

Amazon, you need to add a description to the review you give that this is indeed the same DVD as the Sunshine Beginners DVD.",1314576000,3,625,4.504424778761062

2763655,2,B000NA6W5Y,"I recently purchased Boomers Workout and was quite disappointed. The DVD claimed this would be a 40 minute workout, but, in fact, the running time is 27 minutes. In doing the routine, I noticed at least 3 times, the screen would say, ""Start set one,"" or ""Start set two"" and in each instance, there was no set two or no set one, respectively. My guess is that about 13 minutes got cut on the editing floor inadvertently. The actual exercises and workout are decent, but the product doesn't meet its claims and participants are not getting the full workout promised. Also, I contacted Funcercise and have never received a reply, which is also disappointing.",1222992000,20,655,4.754385964912281
