8362324,5,6301007417,"Four Acts. Vocalists/Soloists: Richard Lewis, Josephine Barstow, Leo Goeke, Bozena Betley, Alexander Oliver.  Glyndebourne Chorus, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Sir John Pritchard, Conductor.  COMPLETE OPERA. Synopsis: Idomeneo was recorded at the 1974 Glyndeborne Festival Opera and features a highly original production of epic proportions.  Although one on Mozart's lesser-known operas, it sparkles with the composer's usual brilliant melodies, and in fact it is only the now-unfashionably formal story that has kept this opera out of the mainstream.  Richard Lewis confirms his position as the world's leading exponent of the title role, and the part of Elecria is sung by the great soprano Josephine Barstow.  Seeing a production of this Mozart rarity is a real treat, especially with a superb cast and conductor like this one.  NTSC.  OPD-1408.  Released in 1998",1162771200,,869,5.682170542635659
