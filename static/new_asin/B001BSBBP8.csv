8284457,5,B001BSBBP8,"I am a huge fan of the Stooges and really enjoyed watching this silly collection of their routines. I did notice one reviewer was way too harsh with their comments. Sort of makes me wonder if that review was written by a young consumer who simply did not understand the simple style of comedy that the Stooges offers.  Long before there was Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin, there were the Stooges. Personally, I found this funny and very entertaining.",1396137600,,448,4.670886075949367
8284458,5,B001BSBBP8,"Here's a collection worth owning: a presentation of the Stooges' greatest skits as hosted by the goofballs from Mystery Science Theater 3000.  And, a special treat to fans of the Stooges, they're in full, glorious color for the first time!

If you're reading this review already, I probably don't need to sell you on the colorization aspect.  Look at all of the entertainment you enjoy today--it's all in color.  Da Vinci, Ruebens & Van Gogh--all in color.  In fact, pretty much the only reason that these older movies and short subjects are black and white is because of technological limitation.  Now that we can remove that barrier, why not experiment with it?  Especially when the end result looks so good?  Plus, nowhere else will you find such a concentration of Stooge material on a single disc: those days of fumbling through unwound, low-quality VHS tapes are done for good.  And, as a fan of Mystery Science Theater, you simply can't beat intermission antics of the Satellite of Love crew--much funnier than the typical DVD menu.

It's so great to see someone giving the Stooges their due love in this day and age, and the time, energy and money put in to producing these new DVDs the right way really shows.",1227657600,,1218,4.757142857142857
