4510479,5,B004ZMBKNA,"So glad to see this film is finally being released!  I saw this movie for the first time on the big screen at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and loved it at first site.  It is just soooo much fun.

The soundtrack is incredible, and the West Coast Swing-dance duet between Benji Schwimmer and Jordan Frisbee is literally mind blowing.

This is a wonderful movie with a wonderful story, a great cast, made by super-enthusiastic and talented people (heard them speak at the Q&A after the Palm Springs screening).

Every time I watch the movie I catch something new.  Definitely one of those films to put in my collection, as I'll be watching it again and again.

You should definitely buy this film!",1309219200,9,710,4.67741935483871

4510483,1,B004ZMBKNA,Bad acting. I Usuallyat least finish watching a movie but I couldn't do it with this one. Avoid if you value your time.,1403568000,,119,4.217391304347826
4510484,5,B004ZMBKNA,"Although admittedly lower budget, this film has many great musical, dance, and acting performances.  The casting was very good and cinematography stunningly good throughout.  If you don't laugh out loud during some of the great lines in this movie, then your sense of humor must be truly underdeveloped.

I'm not sure what film the other reviewers saw, but it clearly wasn't this film.  First, the amount of Ballroom dancing and musical numbers was outstanding. Second, every one of the main characters evolved and matured during the film.  Third, at least four of the major characters were played by real dancers, one was clearly a professional singer, and none were seasoned actors.  Strictly Ballroom was a major letdown in comparison.",1402963200,,738,5.159663865546219
4510485,2,B004ZMBKNA,The plot was all over the place. There was too much going on and no subject was ever really fully explored. The acting was pretty bad too .,1400716800,,139,4.0
4510486,3,B004ZMBKNA,"Not a whole lot of acting in this.  Lines carefully recited.  People make their marks.  Some fun dance numbers.  A very cute, wholesome lesbian.  But otherwise, meh.",1395792000,,165,4.962962962962963
4510487,4,B004ZMBKNA,and some great choreography. Even some of the bonus features are not to be missed. Really glad I got it.,1390348800,,104,4.25
4510488,5,B004ZMBKNA,"Beahm Teahm create an outstanding coming of age film along with co-writer Jennifer Bechtel. Laurel Vail and Nicole Dionne are the stars of this coming of age movie, featuring So You Think You Can Dance season 2 winner Benji Schwimmer",1384387200,,233,4.85
4510489,5,B004ZMBKNA,So much fun! This movie is not only laugh out loud funny but it is so heartwarming and touching. A must see!!,1382572800,,109,4.0
4510490,2,B004ZMBKNA,I thought this would be moreT about ballroom dancin.  And I have been a fan of Benji Schwimmer's since he wond So You Think You Can Dance.  He only performed one really short routine.,1382400000,,183,4.352941176470588
4510491,5,B004ZMBKNA,I love the relationship between Toni and Mona and the relationship between the two daughters and their mom. One of my favorite scene is the flashback of Toni when she dances with her mom as a child. It's a sweet and funny movie. Nice dancing. The only complaint is that I wish it tells us more why Toni and Mona fell for each other.,1379203200,,332,4.203125
4510492,5,B004ZMBKNA,"Leading Ladies is a fun coming of age film. It has great music, laughs, angst and plenty of dancing. Finding your own path be you gay or straight isn't easy. This movie reminds it doesn't have to be a bad thing. A happy ending is possible if you let love lead. Only thing more amazing than this movie was how easy and total hassle free it was to order from Amazon.com. So thanks Amazon couldn't have done it without you.",1376265600,,420,4.2625
4510493,5,B004ZMBKNA,"While this isn't the typical movie I'd go and see, it was quite good... and in unexpected ways.  The story was cute and rang very true, the cinematography was really neat. (you could tell they spent serious time and attention getting the shots *just* so -- I especially enjoyed the dance numbers)

Even if dance flicks or lesbian movies aren't your thing, I think you'll enjoy the funny look into the family dynamics that drive the plot.  Check it out, it's a different type of movie... and let's face it, we kind of need that.  Aren't you tired of the reboots and sequels that are hitting you all the time?  Check Leading Ladies out... you'll be glad you did... I know I am.",1368489600,,675,4.455284552845528
4510494,4,B004ZMBKNA,"The Campari family is well known in the ballroom dancing circuit. Mom, Sheri (ballroom diva Melanie LaPatin) who was once a ballroom champion herself, is now the driving force behind her up-and-coming ballroom dancer daughter Tasi (Shannon Lea Smith). When Tasi becomes pregnant, the pressure turns to older sister Toni (Laurel Vail) currently Tasi's practice partner, to take the reins.

Toni however, doesn't want to be a star; she prefers working in the background. As if that wasn't enough pressure, Toni has fallen in love with fellow ballroom dancer Mona (Nicole Dionne) and isn't quite sure how to tell Mona or her family.

Directors Daniel Beahm and Erika Randall Beahm have created a wonderfully wacky comedy about love, family, music and the crazy world of competitive ballroom dancing.

Newcomer Laurel Vail is fantastic as wallflower Toni who blossoms when she finds love. ""So You Think You Can Dance"" winner Benji Schwimmer also stars as Toni's gay best friend Cedric. Melanie LaPatin steals the screen as overzealous stage mom Sheri living vicariously through her children.

4510495,5,B004ZMBKNA,I saw this movie on Netflix last night and just bought it today. I absolutely loved it. There is a small ode to Dirty Dancing as well as some jokes which require full attention to get.,1367971200,2,184,4.138888888888889
4510496,2,B004ZMBKNA,"The actress that played the mother was so over played she was a caricature. The rest of the performances were up and down. The plot was predictable, but if played better would have been easier to sit through. The dance scenes were well done; I wish there had been more. If you are looking for a movie to combine lesbian lovers and dancing, this movie is for you. Somehow the movie missed the real issues of acceptance, family ties came through, but were breezed over. Mom's transformation, I guess was too easy and too anti climatic.",1367884800,,533,4.5625
4510497,5,B004ZMBKNA,The first time I watched this on Netflix I was laughing out loud at many of the one liner comments in this movie.  If you like dancing and a little signing in your movies this is a great pic.  There is a beautiful story line that touches the heart.,1360195200,,248,4.040816326530612
4510498,4,B004ZMBKNA,"While there was a lack, actually there was nothing, of ballroom dancing, it was a cute movie.  While we were watching it, I kept asking my partner, ""who is that woman playing the Mother?""  So, I went back to the credits and saw the name Melanie LaPatin.  And, I sat there bemused and began musing about where I had heard that name.  Then, it came to me....dear Heavens, that was the woman who paired with Tony Meredith on the American Ballroom Dancing shows on PBS.  By the way, they were great.  Who knew?  For awhile, I thought it was Laine Kazan!  And, I even remembered when Benjie Schwimmer won So You Think You Can Dance.  Cute movie, agree with 4 and 5 star reviews.  As for lower reviews, perhaps reviewer should read the synopsis of the movie a little better.  Maybe get some glasses.",1360022400,,793,4.4375
4510499,4,B004ZMBKNA,"A lot of lgbt films are low budget and lame.  This is probably low budget, but not that lame. It's funny, and its not about a lesbian stealing some straight girl's heart away from her boyfriend. You should watch this.",1357603200,,217,4.425
4510500,4,B004ZMBKNA,"Awesome story, I would watch it again in a heart beat. Its really cool, and funny. I can truly say that it was interesting.",1357171200,,123,4.166666666666667
4510501,5,B004ZMBKNA,"Very cool movie.  Funny in all the right ways.....intelligent humour and lots of cracks at that nasty little thing, homophobia arghhhh.  A brief story plot.  Two good looking gals want to dance together and the mum of one is a dance coach extrodinaire that wants to help.  They dance into trouble with judges of more than the dance, very judgemental people like many of us run into at times.  A worth watch movie.  Cool!",1349913600,,420,4.608108108108108
4510502,4,B004ZMBKNA,This is a great movie with a focus on a lesbian couple.  It is very original and that is hard to find in this genre.  I just with some scenes weren't so rushed.,1337644800,,160,3.8181818181818183
4510503,5,B004ZMBKNA,"Leading Ladies is a sweet, coming-of-age, coming-out narrative. Telling the story of two sisters, it explores their attempts to stake out their independence from their overbearing stage mother. The film is one part campy and zany, and one part earnest and sweet (I prefer the earnest and sweet part, myself). Laurel Vail stars as Toni Campari, the younger sister who has been living in her sister's shadow but who blossoms when she meets and falls in love with Mona Saunders (played by Nicole Dionne). The chemistry between the two central leads is good. The acting, at least Vail's and Saunders' acting during the more earnest parts of the film, is nuanced--especially Vail's (who is the focus of the film). The dancing is excellent--including an inspired turn by Benji Schwimmer. I would say that it's the best same-sex, ballroom dancing movie EVER, but it might be the ONLY same-sex, ballroom dancing movie ever. (A pity, if true.) Leading Ladies isn't perfect, but for what it's trying to accomplish (tell a compelling love story alongside a madcap, campy narrative of familial dysfunction), it's very good indeed!",1332460800,8,1118,5.081521739130435
4510504,5,B004ZMBKNA,"Disclaimer: The filmmakers are friends of mine. That said let there be no doubt this is a thoroughly enjoyable first film created by a host of very talented folks, on a shoestring budget with a very big studio budget look. They really did create a high quality film with minimal budget and tons of love. Check out the website for the movie to see just how many film festivals around the world have honored this film and you will see it has enjoyed enormous support since it's release. Daniel and Erika put together a team of professional film makers, who worked tirelessly and enthusiastically alongside a number of close friends and family on location in Champaign, Illinois, where with an enormous amount of support from the local populace and with a small contingent of Erika's dedicated students assisting (she is a college professor) they made a great movie shot almost entirely in and around the area.
Spend the bucks, you will not regret it. [...]",1327708800,5,954,4.787878787878788
4510505,3,B004ZMBKNA,Great Movie! The music and dancing are a flashback to the best of musical comedy. If you watch the trailer you haven't seen the best bits yet!!,1326240000,,143,4.333333333333333
4510506,2,B004ZMBKNA,"Expected an entertaining film with some great dancing.  While I can see that this may garner rave reviews within the gay community, as a stand-alone movie, I found it tedious.  I actually thought for a low budget movie the production quality wasn't too bad.  The music is really good and the two leading sisters are somewhat engaging.  However, the script is dire, sorry to say that the acting is pretty dire and most disappointingly, the dance sequences in ""So you think you can Dance"" are so much better than in this movie.  Clearly the dancers are top notch, but the choreography in no way does their skills justice. All the charm that Benji Schwimmer showed on television evaporated in this movie.  I guess it was meant to be a very stylized movie, but I found it heavy handed and almost completely humorless.  Melanie LaPatin seemed like a caricature of Bette Middler on speed, Benji Schwimmer a caricature of Jack from ""Will & Grace"" and the caption on the back of the dvd, ""Strictly Ballroom meets Dirty Dancing"" is very misleading in terms of quality, though you can see what they ""borrowed"" from Strictly Ballroom.  I really thought that if nothing else, the dance sequences would make up for any other shortcomings and sadly this wasn't the case for me.",1319241600,,1263,4.735159817351598
4510507,5,B004ZMBKNA,"Great movie! Great happy story!

4510509,3,B004ZMBKNA,"Unfortunately Leading ladies is a movie with potential which is never realised.  The cast are engaging and quite decent actors, but the story doesn't really go anywhere.  The production quality of movie is only OK.  In some scenes I could barely make out the actors faces.  Disappointing that so many lesbian and gay movies don't live up to expectations.",1318118400,,354,4.9491525423728815

8450272,5,B004ZMBKNA,"I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie. But it's absolutely wonderful!  I LOVE the characters and the actors who play them.  This is my favorite kind of movie: compelling to watch and a lot of fun, but also thought-provoking.  Highly recommended!!",1507420800,,259,4.711111111111111
8450273,5,B004ZMBKNA,"A must-see in dance and queer films! I thought I had seen everything in the LGBTQ genre but this is special and heartarming without being schmaltzy. OK for kids/parents to watch together. There are intimate scenes but nothing graphic and it starts the conversation of being who you are, whether that means doing what you love, being with whom you want and just being yourself!",1496448000,,376,4.8
8450274,5,B004ZMBKNA,"Acting is a bit over-the-top at times, but I get a kick out of seeing Melanie LePatin play a Dance Mom to her two daughters. I've followed Melanie's competitive career since the 1980s and have several videos of her and Tony competing. She is great as the Dance Mom. I remember Benji from ""So You Think You Can Dance"" and was amazed at how versatile a dancer he was. He had a lot of personality, so I'm not surprised when he was cast in this film. He is quite the scene stealer in this film as Cedric, a gay friend of the two daughters in the film.

I thought this was a really cute film. It is about the Campari family, consisting of Dance Mom Mona and her two daughters. Tasi, the competitive dancer, gets pregnant and can't compete in the upcoming competition because she no longer fits the costume. That leaves Toni, the quiet, in-the-closet daughter who has always taken a back seat to Tasi. She is now thrust into the spotlight and expected to dance in Tasi's place. Along the way she meets Mona in a swing club, a free-spirited, out and proud gal who loves to dance. The two click and start a relationship. Toni asks Mona to be her partner in the upcoming competition. They are coached by Cedric and Tasi. I won't give away any more of the plot, but if you love a cute, funny movie that's also a love story, you will enjoy this film. It is light, fun entertainment, and there's some great dancing in it as well.",1433116800,,1417,4.327067669172933
