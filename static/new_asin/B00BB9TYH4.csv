8565246,5,B00BB9TYH4,Brilliant concert love seeing Mark Owen Gary bandmate from Take That during Shine and Nicole doing the LuLu part on Relight my Fire and you will love the extra James doing Prayer with Gary Barlow and may I say that got some moves and JLS singing back for Good with Gary. Just love it!,1426118400,,284,4.277777777777778

8565248,5,B00BB9TYH4,"Gary has the whole package - great singer, songwriter, musician, performer.  I have over 40 live performances on DVD, and I can play this one back to back, I can't get enough of it.  He's one of the best artists, and it's surprising to see that most people in the US don't even know him - though many know his songs without realizing who he is.
If you're a fan of Gary and Take That, I also highly recommend the Circus DVD.  Just as awesome!",1400025600,2,441,4.1647058823529415
8565249,5,B00BB9TYH4,AMAZING concert! I'd like to see and hear more Gary Barlow performances.. Come to the USA soon for a concert tour!!!!,1383609600,3,117,4.619047619047619
8565250,5,B00BB9TYH4,Okay I must admit my 5 stars is based on Amazon. Com UK reviews since I have not been able to buy this product for one reason-The Price. This dvd is tagged as an import yet it also states it is NTSC which makes no sense since on UK site its PAL region 2 which does not work on US players. Why would an import be NTSC which does not work on European players. Amazon UK has starting prices at a little over 6 pounds for used copies and a little over 7 for new. Come on amazon get this  US price into a reasonable rate so  Barlow can start to make some fans in US.He is one fantastic performer as is his group Take That.,1365120000,5,617,3.888888888888889
