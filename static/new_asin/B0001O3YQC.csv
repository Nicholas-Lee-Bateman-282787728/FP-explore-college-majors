8015726,5,B0001O3YQC,"my five year old son loves Dave, like a personal buddy to him and he learns so much from these movies. Few things for children are presented well as it takes a certain gifted awareness of children in order to accomplish this. i know because i'm an adult child. these dvds, they're really mine but don't tell my son. i love dave and becky's humor. so please don't attack dave and becky's humor on here anymore because i feel very protective of them and it hurts me. so stop it. the dvds were expensive as i'm sure they are hard to find in dvd version or else we are just suckers but we love them so much, they are worth the price. however, dave and becky are priceless and irreplaceable. though the dvds were considered used quality, they were in brand new condition from goodwill in california. very happy with seller and product. a keeper for our (my) permanent collection.",1369008000,,874,4.46875
8015727,4,B0001O3YQC,"We bought this after we borrowed one of them from the library and our oldest son loved it.  Unfortunately, our kids have watched it maybe 5 times now (not the whole DVD) and don't ask for it.  I think it's a fun and educational way to teach kids about these things, so my husband and I are bummed that they're not excited about it.  Yes, Dave is kinda cheesy, but the younger kids (toddlers, preschoolers) should enjoy it.  I think they'd be more into it if we had started them at age 2.  My 4 and 5-year old childcare girls always ask for it, though.  I guess every kid is different.  Still, I think the DVD is the perfect blend of humor, excitement, and information for kids, so I'm giving it 4 stars.  The price is reasonable, so you could buy 1 set and see what your kids think of it.  Their favorite is absolutely the Rescue one, no surprise there, and it's the most interesting for me, too.  Our kids actually enjoy the ""There Goes a Bulldozer"" DVD, if that's any help.",1308787200,4,975,4.278688524590164
8015728,3,B0001O3YQC,My boys love all these videos.  I do not love it.  It actually is educational but really only appealing to kids >4,1298851200,,114,4.136363636363637
8015729,5,B0001O3YQC,"My son is obsessed with anything that has to do with transportation especially fire trucks and police cars.  This was a major hit!  He LOVES them, and has even learned a thing or two from the movies.  Great buy for the money!",1294185600,,225,4.309523809523809
8015730,5,B0001O3YQC,"My son is addicted to watching these movies.

I love the fact they are educational.  I don't feel guilty when he's watching them.

When we are driving through town he is constantly pointing out things that he learned from these videos.",1277596800,2,235,4.682926829268292
8015731,5,B0001O3YQC,"Yes, Dave is goofy, but that's exactly why the little kids love him.  The large amount of information included in each episode is interesting even for adults. Our 5-year-old and my 10-year-old students enjoy these videos and the adults don't mind watching them over and over.",1247875200,7,275,4.978260869565218
8015732,5,B0001O3YQC,These DVDs have come with us on long car trips and satisfied our little one. My son began to really get into them when he was 2 1/2 and he still loves them a year later. A great buy (and tolerable for adults too.),1186531200,7,213,3.8636363636363638
