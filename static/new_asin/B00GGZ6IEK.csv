OK so the video quality is not uniformly high BUT this is TPH at their height, in the Howie days, and this collection includes both some seldom heard gems, such as ""License to Kill"" as well as some stellar performances of classics like their cover of ""Rainy Day Women"" and ""Refugee""-its a great find for those of us who well remember these days as they were our best also! Each song was recorded at a different venue, ranging from TV tapings to mega stadiums. Includes the great ""Even the Losers"" and ""Straight Into Darkness""-yes!",1444089600,12,585,4.689320388349515
