8107081,5,B000E8M0RY,"For decades, I have had the glorious choice of two CD sets of the complete Beethoven Quartets: one by the Quarteto Italiano and the other by the Lindsays. Earlier vinyls by the Amadeus, the Hollywood, the Griller and the Busch filled my record shelves, and I have heard many of the works in live concert performances by the greatest quartets of our era. Having borrowed all 3 volumes of the complete DVD recordings by the Alban Berg from a friend, I was sufficiently impressed to desire my own copies, and opted for Vols 1 and 2 because  Vol 3 was so much more expensive for no good reason. I have to report that my initial impression, if anything, underrated their virtues. They are outstanding in every criterion by which a DVD can be evaluated.
Each volume has two discs. In Vol. l, the first disc begins with Op 18, No 4. The only one of the 6 quartets in this Opus written in the minor key. It is ideally suited to the fluently flexible style and exquisite sensitivity typical of this ensemble. The first movement is a masterpiece on its own, and the subsequent movements do not quite match the profound and haunting experience of its long, extended, principle themes. They are however played almost to perfection, with one slight criticism: after the ferocious pace of the opening Menueto in the 3rd movement, the Trio that follows, marked Allegretto, it taken at too slow a pace, and the violent contrast upsets the balance of the movement.
The great Op 131 that follows is given a performance notable for its accuracy, and its success in capturing the contrasting moods of the work: the brooding opening movement; the playfulness of the 5th (Presto); and the defiance of the final Allegro that becomes increasingly taken over by self-doubt, ending in resigned capitulation. But the heart of the work lies in the 4th , a set of variations on one of the loveliest melodies that exists in the entire quartet repertoire. It demands, and receives, great attention to the tonal and rhythmic changes in the progress from one variation to the next, together with a firm grasp of the movements architectural structure that keeps the whole from disintegrating into its individual parts. My one criticism relates to the role of the leader. Gunter Pichler is a master of his instrument, and in terms of his musical authority, an inspiration to his colleagues, but the sweetness of his tone can at times become thin, such that the theme of which he is in control may be masked by the accompaniment. He leads by consensus and persuasion, but there are times when one misses the more forceful and dictatorial tone of, say, Robert Mann of the Julliard or Peter Cropper of the Lindsays.
Op. 18, No 1,  is a remarkable accomplishment for a first attempt at the genre. It apparently underwent extensive revision before performance and publication, and is said to have persuaded the great Haydn to cancel all future string quartet projects. The 2nd movement, marked Adagio affetuoso ed appassionato, is ravishing. It has a feeling of loss and despair, enhanced by the extended line of its themes, often to a pulsing accompaniment that raises the level of the emotional intensity. It received an outstanding performance. Elsewhere, artful decoration and playful interaction characterize the style of the other three movements, features that display the rich talents of this gifted ensemble.
The 2nd disc opens with Op 18, No 3. This is perhaps the least attractive of all the quartets, but it receives an exquisite performance. The thematic material is not very interesting in its own right, but the twists and turns of Beethovens imaginative manipulations have their own charm and excitement that the performers bring out in full measure. The final Allegro is a ferocious Tarantella that demands immaculate unison to achieve the modulations in pace and volume, and it gets exactly what is required.
Op 74 (The Harp) is next up. The first movement that gives the work its name presents many difficulties arising from the extensive pizzicato passages immediately followed by firm bowing, a transition not easily achieved when 4 individuals have to do so simultaneously. Here, it is done to perfection in the best performance of the movement I know. The 3rd movement scherzo and its equally fast-paced trio bring out a strident character in the playing that is the groups Achilles heel, and a certain raggedness pervades the final theme and variations that follow without a break. But there is also some wonderfully sensitive pianissimo passages, and the explosive coda brings the whole to an exhilarating termination.
Last comes Op 130. The long opening movement is slow and ponderous, with outbursts of anger and brilliance. It is very difficult to bring off convincingly, but here the various moods and tempi are beautifully integrated in a performance that is well-nigh perfect. The 2nd is brief, dominated by rising climaxes and descents on the 1st Violin that should give the sensation of a concerto rather than a quartet, but Pichler plays it as too integral a part of the orchestra and it loses its dominant role. The 3rd and 4th are musically straightforward and not especially interesting, but the haunting and hesitating 5th (Cavatina) is handled exceptionally well. Beethovens original concluding movement was the Grosse Fugue, but its overwhelming demands led to an optional Allegro, often referred to as the Haydn Finale, that is half as long and one-fifth as difficult. This is how the disc ends, on a perfunctory note, but there is so much wonderful music preceding it.",1400112000,3,5570,4.943436499466382
8107082,5,B000E8M0RY,You do not need to think twice about obtaining this first of three volumes. It contains the Opus 131 in C sharp minor which is a stunning work. This volume also contains five other quartets which serve as a good introduction to the Beethoven quartets. It is very easy to imagine yourself in the concert hall which is an advantage over the CDs. All four musicians are superb and the ensemble playing incredible. The DVD gives you the chance to look at the bowing of the instruments and watch the ensemble playing. The audio quality is fine. I also have the other two volumes which are also excellent. I have complete sets of the Vermeer and Takacs on CD which are very different performances but also very enjoyable.  As an amateur cellist I really enjoy playing along with these recordings. It is both humbling and also an incentive to keep on practicing. If you have never seen a string quartet performance or heard these Beethoven quartets acquiring this DVD will be one of the best decisions you have made. Hopefully with the internet we will be able to experience live performances of ensembles like this with increasing frequency.,1262390400,7,1135,4.732323232323233
8107083,5,B000E8M0RY,"The Alban Berg Quartett always has been a very disciplined group and this cycle of the Beethoven quartets demonstrates ensemble playing of the very highest order - it just does not get any better. These are superb musical performances judged by almost any standard and for those wanting a video dimension in their quartets, these DVDs have to be the best available.

But, if I may digress for a moment; I have yet to be convinced that video enhances the level of enjoyment of this type of music. More often than not, I find it a distraction from the primary function of musical appreciation and this DVD set is a case in point. Camera work is moderately good and tolerably well directed relative to the score, although there are occasions where the musical focus might be on, say, the second violin but the camera is yet again absorbed with the unpleasant angularity of the Mozart-Saal organ case. There are too many of these instances which I find irritating and attention-diverting; ditto the ABQ's somewhat theatrical flourishes at the conclusion of a movement. And do we really need to see/hear the instruments being tuned before every movement? Once at the beginning of a work is sufficient.

As has been suggested elsewhere, these works may be experienced in sound only but that does seem a waste of the money paid for the video component.

On the positive side, the video can be helpful in identifying the inner parts with their respective instruments; useful in the absence of a score. However, for audio only (without the video distraction) I prefer to listen to a couple of other chamber groups who maintain a spontaneity and freshness which, in my view, seem in large measure to have been polished out by The Berg's striving for that homogeneity they so successfully have achieved. An example of this perceived ""sterility"" is the Heiliger Dankgesang from the A minor quartet, one of chamber music's most emotionally-charged passages but I think in this performance more than a little bland.

Regardless of my criticisms, these are absolutely first class technical performances and I recommend them. Incidentally, these comments are derived from watching/listening to all three volumes in this set; not just the volume being the subject of this review.",1190592000,13,2262,4.96042216358839
8107084,5,B000E8M0RY,"A 100% class act, and the recording is great too. You don't have to watch the video to enjoy it. Just select DTS, then sit back and listen to some of the finest talent around. They make it look so darned easy!",1182816000,3,209,4.0
8107085,5,B000E8M0RY,"Five MAGNIFICENT Stars!! This stunning two-DVD set deserves Six Stars! This multiple award-winning classical string quartet, the Alban Berg Quartett,  is composed of supreme musicians, who are also very prestigious teachers in Vienna.  Gunter Pichler and Gerhard Schulz are on 1st and 2nd violins, respectively; Valentine Erben is on cello; and the late Thomas Kakuska is on viola. It is wonderful to see and hear any great chamber quartet but these men are in the class of very few string ensembles: ever! This is second time they have done ""the cycle"" and this time it's on DVD, recorded live in Vienna during 1989. This is Part 1 of 3 DVD sets.

Founded in 1971, the Viennese-based quartet deserves another sort of award for longevity, amid few personnel changes, since some similar string quartets have folded their tents during the ABQ's 35 year run.  When I bought this DVD it was very pricey, but for two beautifully recorded, aurally perfect, stunningly performed discs, it is worth every penny. This DVD, detailing the ABQ playing a section of the Beethoven string quartet cycle, is A KEEPER. And I'm going after the complete cycle.

When these remarkable performances were recorded, the ABQ was totally prepared for the challenges of the Beethoven string quartets. ""The 'Berg"" literally work up a sweat as they elegantly, accurately, and furiously bow their way through these beautiful complex works of music. Their concept, cooperation, and command of nuance is BREATHTAKING to listen to and watch, as the music's volume ebbs and flows. My 'Piece De Resistance' favorites are all of the movements of No 10, E Flat Major, Opus 74 (Harp), which has stunning arco and pizzicato work, the overlapping instrumentation with each member taking the lead at times, and the tremendous demand on strength, patience, and timing. One hesitation and everything could collapse in on itself. But not here and not ever for these formidable musicians.

The camera cuts are numerous and riveting, the sound (Dolby Digital 5.0, DTS 5.0, or PCM stereo) is crystal clear, and the performances (one and all) are truly magnificent. (Region 1, NTSC. Liner notes in English, German, and French.) And let's not forget Mr Beethoven, himself, a true musical uber-genius who produced these most formidable of works amid personal turbulence and tragedy. Highly recommended. Six Stars!!!

(Notes:
*There are two other ABQ DVDs which complete the Beethoven string quartet cycle with Thomas Kakuska in the viola chair. Since this recording there has been one  change in the ABQ lineup. With death approaching, Mr Kakuska stated his express wishes that the quartet continue performing and that his brilliant former student, Isabel Charisius, take the viola chair: both wishes were honored, thankfully.

* There is also a great box CD set of the complete Beethoven String Quartet cycle by the Berg, which features two incarnations of the ABQ with either original violist Hatto Beyerle (member from 1971 to 1981) or Thomas Kakuska (1981 to his death in 2005);

*Alban Berg, the quartet's namesake, is the famed ""Second Viennese School"" composer (after ""First Viennese School""ers Beethoven, Mozart and Haydn). His widow graciously gave permission for the use of his name.)",1142467200,35,3245,5.152091254752852
