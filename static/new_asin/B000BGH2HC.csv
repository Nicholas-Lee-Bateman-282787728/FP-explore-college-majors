2416144,3,B000BGH2HC,"Sometimes you need more than an intriguing premise - a guy with amnesia learns he's a gangster with a lot of enemies - and excellent cinematography by John Alton (T-MEN, HE WALKED BY NIGHT) to make an entertaining movie.  Based on the positive reviews I've read I had high hopes for this film, but it ended up the one middle-of-the-road review I saw (in ""The Film Noir Bible"") was the most accurate.  This film has the makings of a minor noir classic, but it doesn't happen.

I didn't care for the main character; I felt no sympathy for him because he kept putting himself in harm's way.  The female lead had no screen presence and the bad guy wasn't intimidating.  I did enjoy the 40's street scenes.  Any noir fan should at least watch it once, but I don't think the average film fan will care for it.  Nice picture on the DVD though.

Also look for a brief appearance by the often uncredited Jack Overman (T-MEN, BRUTE FORCE, THE LONG NIGHT) as a hood in the scene where Eddie goes to the Golden Horn club.",1146009600,25,1009,4.387096774193548
2416145,5,B000BGH2HC,"Eddie Rice (John Payne) is a WWII veteran that's just been released out of the hospital. Because of a combat injury, he has complete amnesia. The only thing he knows is that he came from Los Angeles, so he goes to the city looking for someone, anyone, who might recognize him and help him unravel his past. Unfortunately, the first ones to recognize him are cops, who know him by another name, Eddie Riccardi, cold-blooded gangster. But they don't know that he's totally forgotten his notorious past. After being released by the cops, Eddie runs into his ex-wife, Nina (Ellen Drew) who's not too pleased to see him. The Eddie she knew was cruel and heartless, and of course she's very reluctant to believe his amnesia story. The next one to find out that ""Eddie's back in town"" is Eddie's former mob boss, Vince Alexander (Sonny Tufts). Vince is also upset that Eddie has returned, because Eddie had double-crossed him years ago and Vince has been waiting to get revenge ever since.

Because of the watchful eyes of the local cops and detectives, Vince sees that killing Eddie and getting away with it is impossible. So, he does the next best thing. He frames Eddie for the murder of a respected police officer, and before long Eddie (with plenty of angry cops looking for him) is wishing he'd just stayed at the hospital and left his past as a blank space. He finally convinces his ex-wife that his amnesia is genuine, and she finally decides to help him escape from the police as well as try to clear himself before his rediscovered life is brought to a tragic end. And while he's at it, Eddie sparks up a new romance with his ex-wife, who's very pleased with the ""new"" Eddie that`s kind and loving. With the cops closing in fast on Eddie, he bravely decides to take on Vince and his gang alone in a deserted building. Will the cops arrive in time to save Eddie, or will they find nothing but corpses filled with lead? Watch and find out!

1949's ""The Crooked Way"" is an obscure but highly enjoyable film noir, with some of the most stylish noir photography and lighting I've ever seen. This is because the cinematography was handled by the legendary John Alton, the most recognized and respected name in film noir cinematography. To be honest, I've never thought of John Payne as a great actor. However, with his gloomy, cynical personality and his frequent frowning, he was perfect for film noir, and appeared in several classics besides this one (""Kansas City Confidential"", ""Slightly Scarlet"", ""99 River Street"", ""Hell's Island""). With sharp dialogue, a well-crafted and fast-paced plot, and amazing cinematography, ""The Crooked Way"" is a great film noir that deserves a better reputation. Recently released on DVD by Geneon Entertainment, the picture quality is wonderful. The sound quality was only average, but considering the very low price of the DVD I have no complaints. If you enjoy classic noir films, then add this gem to your collection!",1136073600,62,2954,4.767578125

2416148,4,B000BGH2HC,"The image of the 2005 Geneon DVD blows this Blu ray away... totally.
The movie gets 4.5 stars for being a legit noir.

How could a DVD image be better than a Blu ray?
The reason, I believe, is that The Crooked Way is in the Public Domain. When a movie is in the Public Domain it is up for grabs to anyone or any entity to put out for sale in any kind of condition they can get their hands on. Geneon put out their DVD in 2005 and obviously had a near pristine visual source for their transfer. I see no evidence of DNR or grain removal or other digital tinkering on the DVD from Geneon.

Now, John Alton was the cinematographer for The Crooked Way.  He also photographed: The Outlaw, Bury Me Dead, T-Men, Raw Deal, The Amazing Mr. X, He Walked By Night, Border Incident, I the Jury, The Big Combo etc... all significant noirs. He was known for using as little lighting as possible to create shadows and impressive light-to-dark effects. He wrote a book titled: Painting With Light which is a primer for his noir work and a lighting guide to all Directors of Photography still.

The image of the Blu ray in the Kino Lorber release has either been brightened to bring out more shadow detail (which was NOT intended by John Alton) or the print was so washed out by being lensed so many times that the projector lights washed it out. It has tear marks & glitches galore and, to add insult to injury, the DTS HD audio is not much better than the Geneon 2005 DVD.

The Geneon DVD from 2005 has INKY black levels... so inky that ONLY the intended focus of the scene (be it human or production design) is lighted. THIS, is exactly the way John Alton worked. He lit the scenes for the intended subject and let the rest fall into shadows. He was a very insistent cinematographer and had a reputation for being very demanding to work with. In 1951, he and Alfred Gilks were awarded the  Academy Award for color photography for An American in Paris.

All I'm saying is that the image of this Blu ray is NOT what John Alton intended based on his work in the above mentioned Film Noirs. Do yourself a favor, trust me, get the Geneon release and see the image as intended, granted, the audio has pops, hiss and crackles but the dialog heavy film is easily understood. Because, after all, Film Noir is first and foremost about visual atmosphere & chiaroscuro (the treatment of light and shade in drawing and painting) and the Geneon 2005 DVD has it in spades (as in, Sam Spade)!

We watched about 20 minutes of this Blu ray, turned it off and put on the Geneon 2005 DVD and were FLOORED at how much better the DVD image came off. I relegated the Blu ray to my closet for a future trade in.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE most Blu ray images/sound and have an extensive collection of Blu rays but, if you love Film Noir, this Kino Lorber release of The Crooked Way is a WASTE of TIME. Don't believe Gary Tooze at dvdbeaver.com on this one... he's wrong.",1455408000,9,2933,4.318181818181818

2416150,4,B000BGH2HC,"I have mixed feelings about THE CROOKED WAY, a 1949 film noir that has been released onto Blu-ray by Kino Lorber.

John Payne stars as a war hero, suffering from permanent amnesia.  Discharged from the hospital five years after the conflicts end, he travels to Los Angeles, the city in which he enlisted, and is immediately picked up by a police detective  (Rhys Williams) who knows him as a career criminal.  Payne has no memory of his past and, since there are no charges pending against him, hes released.

Almost immediately thereafter, he encounters his former wife (Ellen Drew), who he doesnt remember either.  Shes currently working for Sonny Tufts, a mob leader with a grudge against Payne.  Our hero gets beat up several times by the mobsters henchmen and, after being framed for murder, goes on the run, hoping to prove his innocence.

A solid cast and, especially, John Altons magnificent black-and-white cinematography enhance THE CROOKED WAY.  Unfortunately, Richard H. Landaus screenplay (adapted from a radio play by Robert Monroe) is a bit confusing, particularly when it comes to character motivations, and Robert Floreys direction is uneven.  Nevertheless, Altons contribution does make this film worth the viewing.

2416154,4,B000BGH2HC,"This tense noir stars John Payne as a WWII veteran who is released from a hospital suffering from an extreme case of amnesia. The war wound has left him a permanent amnesiac, and Eddie Rice, played by Payne, returns to Los Angeles to attempt to piece his life back together. He is quickly arrested by 2 police detectives, who recognize him as Eddie Ricardi, who was a former employee of the notorious mob boss, Sonny Tufts. The police are skeptical about Eddie's memory, but have no reason to hold him at this time. They no sooner release him when he is taken and then beaten up badly by members of Sonny's gang. No one, especially even his ex-wife, Nina, played by Ellen Drew, seems pleased to see Eddie again. When he is subsequently framed for murder, he has no choice, but to find the real killer and clear his name by navigating through the crooked underbelly of Los Angeles. The film was based on the radio play, ""No Blade Too Sharp"", written by Robert Monroe. The theme of an amnesiac victim who must act as a detective in an effort to uncover his past is a familiar one in noir circles. What truly elevates this film is the stunning cinematography by the remarkable Mr. John Alton. Alton's use of chiaroscuro totally ramped-up the use of authentic locations to provide some stunning visuals. In addition, director Robert Florey utilized his knowledge of both expressionism and surrealism to fully capitalize on Alton's excellent talents. The final scene of a warehouse shootout is especially excellent. For all who are aware of Alton's talents, it is no surprise that almost every frame of the film is exceptional with it's visuals. Along with the excellent photography by Alton, there is some top-level acting turned in by most in the cast. Exceptional roles are turned in by John Payne as Eddie Rice/Ricardi, Ellen Drew as his ex-wife Nina, Vince Alexander as mob boss Sonny Tufts, and noir veteran Percy Helton as Petey. The running time of the film is 86 minutes. It is presented in full frame, with Dolby Digital 2.0. In addition, the film transfer by Geneon is surprisingly very good! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

2416155,5,B000BGH2HC,"John Payne's Eddie Rice (aka Riccardi) got some shrapnel embedded into his head during WW2 and now he can't remember anything about his past or who he even is. All that he knows is that he's from L.A., and that turns out to be far more than he bargained for. As soon as he arrives in town he's pegged by the cops. It seems that his pre-war years were somewhat shady. Payne is befuddled and determined to sort things out, and it all soon spirals downward in true fatalistic Noir fashion.

Thanks to John Alton's camera and Robert Florey's assured direction THE CROOKED WAY is a textbook example of the Noir look/style. Scene after scene, image after image. Great on location shots of L.A., day and night, a true historical time capsule. Lots of shadows and neon. And it's really a pretty good film as well as Eddie Rice finds his true self and even his wife!

2416156,4,B000BGH2HC,"I see that Amazon has only one of these Geneon editions of the Crooked Way left.  I also know that Geneon is no longer printing the title. Hence I bought 2. The Crooked Way is one of my favorite B-Noir films; this Geneon print is also close to excellent. I happen to be a John Payne fan, and maybe that has a lot to do with his often cynical and despairing manner, a great Noir fit.  He seemed to have gotten those character roles often enough. Anyway, an interesting film and it moves very well. Whoever nails this last Amazon copy, I hope you enjoy the film. It's a bit of a gem, and except for the brief Geneon interlude, has been almost impossible to find, at least from a factory source. If you know the Noir DVD market, you already know this.",1331251200,3,748,4.223776223776224
2416167,4,B000BGH2HC,"Amnesia is one of the staples - even cliches - of film noir, and it is often used brilliantly, especially in the short-term variety brought on by alcohol or knocks on the head (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Angel/dp/B00023P4G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Angel</a>&nbsp;is a fine example that comes to mind). There are a number of reasons for this usage - the war and it's psychological effect on the returning soldiers is certainly the most obvious external one, but in the labyrinthine, shadowy world of noir a search for a missing identity, a missing past can often add layers to an already complex story or set of characters.

THE CROOKED WAY shows us a less-common variant - total amnesia afflicting the protaganist, Eddie Rice (John Payne). Rice only knows from the Army doctors that he enlisted in Los Angeles, so he gets off the bus there to try to find clues as to his old life - and is quickly accosted by a pair of cops who know him as Eddie Riccardi, a small-time criminal in the employ of much bigger name Vince Alexander (Sonny Tufts) that they're still trying to put away for good, though Eddie's testimony against him had put him in the slammer for a while. And Eddie was apparently married, to Nina Martin (Ellen Drew) - who blames her for walking out on him. So he's got some problems - an angry wife prepared to turn him over to the mob, and a mob boss who wants him dead or at least hurt for what he did in the past. And Eddie can't remember any of it.

THE CROOKED WAY suffers a bit from not doing enough with the whole memory-loss angle. Eddie never seems even on the verge of really recovering his memories, but he manages to put together a past record pretty easily - and there's never any real doubt that it's the real past either.  A masterpiece like THE BIG SLEEP keeps you guessing as to the motives and actions of nearly everybody throughout; here there's no question that Eddie is more or less the ""hero"" and that he's on the road to moral recovery ever if he can't get his old memories back.  Though apparently a pretty nasty piece of work in his former life, now he's a typical example of the positive noir protaganist, someone trying to do right and atone, rarely if ever tempted into his old ways. And the cops badger him and go after him mercilessly - until they all of a sudden get the word from the Army that in fact his amnesia story is true, at which point they're more or less on his side. It's all a little too easily put together, and wrapped up.

But if the plotting and screenplay (by Robert H. Landau, based on a radio play) are obvious and sometimes even perfunctory, nothing else in this excellent production is particularly problematic. The cast is fine - why Payne, a better looking Fred MacMurray or a tougher Dana Andrews - never developed a better career is beyond me, he's been excellent in the half-dozen films (noir and westerns) that I've seen him in; and Tufts certainly gives a performance good enough to make me wonder why he was long considered a joke.  Ellen Drew is tough and just attractive enough - little attempt is made to make her a glamor-girl type; Rhys Williams as Lt. Joe Williams does one of the better cynical cops I've seen in these films. And director Robert Florey's camerawork is fluid and his attention to the L.A. locations is as good as anything from the 40s I think - this really gives a feel for the place that set-bound work can never quite capture. But the biggest star is probably the photography of John Alton, the great master of the noir lighting style, who here shows that he's just as good at capturing the blinding L.A. sun as he is at depicting dimly lit nightclubs, police stations and alleys.

Note on the DVD:  I wouldn't normally expect much from a company like Geneon, but this is a decent release with good contrast and fair sharpness; don't think it's a crappy public domain copy, it's quite decent.  No extras at all though, not even a menu - the disc starts up as soon as you pop it in.  Worth it I'd say for the noirophile at a budget price.",1289088000,4,4094,4.557823129251701
2416168,4,B000BGH2HC,"I liked this much more than the other reviewers. I put off watching it for a long time because of the amnesia angle. It's such a tired premise. (Like multiple personality disorder, the kind of amnesia you see in these films rarely happens in real life. These films make it seem like a common occurance.) But when I finally watched THE CROOKED WAY, I was enchanted. For me, the visual aspects of film are more important than any other elements, like plot or dialogue. That's why I love Noir. And this film, visually, is just as noir as it gets. There are moments of stunning beauty, and some images that are the very essence of Noir iconography. This is, of course, due to John Alton's genius. I also found the story very engaging. I see that the dvd is now out of print. I hope someone like KINO takes this opportunity for a restoration. (The soundtrack is pretty hissy.) If you are a Noir fan, do not miss this film.",1287705600,4,917,4.4
2416169,4,B000BGH2HC,"The film has all the production features of a first rate movie. Chiaroscuro Black and White, sharply etched images, beautifully modeled characters. It has John Payne, an experienced actor by the time of the film, 1949, for years a second or third tier leading man (not strong enough himself to carry a film but a successful support to some of the top actresses of the day). There is a workmanlike script, not seeking nor finding originality, but successfully covering all the bases of a tough guy-cops thriller.
There is an accomplished cast of professional actors who help make any star look good. Most of all, there is Sonny Tuft. As I said in the lead-in, to appreciate seeing Sonny Tuft as a  ruthless gang leader, ""ya hadda be there"" during WW2, when most established stars were in service and Sonny Tuft, come from nowhere and going to nowhere, co-starred with Bing Crosby and Betty Hutton, then coming into her own as one of Hollywood's Big Ones, in a major A film for Paramount. In fact, he made a series of A films getting above the title billing. Then the guys came back and Sonny Tufts picked up work as the guy who was once a star. There were jokes about Sonny Tuft, the actor; though, a husky, not bad looking man, who had trained operatically, he had a weedy voice and awkward demeanor. He was not Paul Muni (Scarface), Edward G. Robinson (Little Caesar) nor even Richard Widmark (Tommy Udo in Kiss of Death), he was a big, rather clumsy guy with an unimpressive voice and ungainly manner. Last I saw of him was on stage in a live theater, part of a circuit, including neighborhood playhouses throughout NYC, playing in a farce of the Yukon, a production which was never meant to hit Broadway (or even Kansas City).
Well, nostalgia aside, this is a well done film, of excellent B, though not  A caliber.  I would put it on the level of a decent, made for TV,  film, with superior camerawork.",1257724800,2,1905,4.56140350877193
2416170,4,B000BGH2HC,"""The Crooked Way"" is a minor film noir from 1949 with a familiar premise. Eddie Rice (John Payne) is a World War II veteran who has been in a rehabilitation hospital in San Francisco due to amnesia. A piece of shrapnel imbedded in his brain has caused him to loose all memory of his life and identity. Army records say only that he is Eddie Rice from Los Angeles. So he goes to Los Angeles in hopes that someone will recognize him, and someone does. Two police officers stop him at the train station and take him in for questioning. They say he is Eddie Ricardi, a gangster who ratted out his colleague Vince Alexander (Sonny Tufts) to save himself before skipping town 5 years ago. His ex-wife Nina Martin (Ellen Drew) also recognizes Eddie and rings Vince to say he's back in town.

""The Crooked Way"" was based on a radio play called ""No Blade Too Sharp"" and directed by Robert Florey. The cinematographer is John Alton. The print I watched is very high contrast, to the point that shadows are often completely black. I don't know if the contrast on that print or transfer might be too high, but, as Alton is famous for not caring about detail in shadows, I'm inclined to think this is just a very high contrast film, like the great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/T-Men/dp/B000KJTGFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">T-Men</a>. In any case, this is a classic scenario of a man with no memory trying to discover himself, only to discover that he was not a good guy. He cannot recapture his memory or escape his past. It's reminiscent of the 1946 film noir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Somewhere-in-the-Night/dp/B0009X7678/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Somewhere in the Night</a>, a more iconic film that takes itself less seriously.

John Payne is tall, handsome, and tough as Eddie Rice, but he isn't given a lot to do. Eddie is a simpler character than ""Somewhere in the Night""'s George Taylor. He seems oddly unfazed to learn that he was a sadistic thug in a previous life. Police Lieutenant Williams (Rhys Williams) has a quality unlike any policeman I've seen on film: a disarming combination of affability and nerve. Nothing scares him, and he is equally at ease with cops and gangsters. His manner is non-threatening; his pursuit of justice in not. ""The Crooked Way"" is not complex. It's dialogue is not especially sharp. But it is an entertaining film characteristic of the noir style.

The DVD (Geneon 2005): This is a grainy print, but there are only a few scratches or visible flaws apart from the grain, so it's not bad. Sound is ok. It isn't distracting, but it's not quite clean either. As I mentioned, the film is unusually high contrast, even for 1940s crime film, but I chalk that up to Alton. There are no subtitles, bonus features, or scene menu.",1244419200,4,2847,5.0275423728813555

2416174,3,B000BGH2HC,"""The Crooked Way"" is a 1949 film noir using the all too familiar theme of an amnesiac attempting to put the puzzling pieces of his life back together.  War hero Eddie Rice has been convalescing for 5 years in a San Francisco military hospital for wounds that have left a piece of shrapnel lodged deep within his brain.  Rice played by John Payne, only knows that he'd enlisted in Los Angeles.  He is convinced by his doctor to return there to hopefully discover his true identity.

Upon his arrival in L.A., Payne gets a lukewarm reception from police lieutenant Joe Williams played by Rhys Williams, owing to the fact that he is actually Eddie Riccardi a known gangster.  His old boss Vince Alexander played by Sonny Tufts has solidified his power base and views Payne as a threat.  Payne also meets up with the attractive Nina Martin played by the attractive Ellen Drew, working as a hostess in a gambling den fronted by Tufts.  Shockingly Payne learns that Drew was once his wife.

Tufts tries to frame Payne for a murder he committed of policeman Williams, who was putiing the heat on his operation.  Payne aided by the now sympathetic Drew must uncover evidence to prove his innocence as L.A.P.D. is hot on his trail.

2416175,3,B000BGH2HC,"In movie story parlance a character arc is a significant development that dramatically changes the life pattern that individual is pursuing.

In the case of the 1949 film noir vehicle ""The Crooked Way"" John Payne, a former musical star at Twentieth-Century Fox opposite their popular blondes Alice Faye and Betty Grable, plays a returning veteran from World War Two.  This was a familiar story element used in many late forties films, but this film involves a unique twist.

In Payne's case he suffers from amnesia and returns to Los Angeles to find out who he really is.  The character arc involves the fact that, the more the viewer learns, the easier it becomes to realize that Payne was not one of the community's solid citizens.  He was, in fact, one of the city's most prominent hoodlums.

The character arc involves the fact that the post-traumatic shock Payne is a thoroughly different man.  His efforts are accordingly twofold, 1) to establish that he is now a decent man, and 2) to learn about those dark secrets of his past life and seek to rectify them while building on his new post-war existence.

Ellen Drew sustains a profound shock when she learns that Payne is truly a changed man.  She was his former wife who soured on him and became involved with his rival a take-no-prisoners mobster played by Sonny Tufts.  Tufts bears a physical resemblance to David Brian, who played gangland bosses in many films of the forties and fifties.

Whereas Drew changes her opinion of Payne when she sees that he is a different person than the selfish, plotting mobster she earlier knew, Tufts has a one-track mind throughout.  A ruthless sociopath, for Tufts all roads lead to one objective - the elimination of Payne.

While this is not one of the more imaginative film noir efforts of the period from the standpoint of story, there are some pluses in this film.  The three leads of Payne, Drew and Tufts dominate and interact superbly, generating dramatic sparks.  Another plus is the excellent, brooding black and white photography of John Alton, one of the leading cinematographers of the post-war noir period, who weaves a fascinating tapestry of the Los Angeles of that period.",1174521600,6,2186,4.838709677419355

The doctors have done all they could for Eddie, a WWII Army veteran awarded with a Silver Star. Eddie has shrapnel embedded in his brain, scar tissue grown around it. Shrapnel's given him amnesia. The doctor informs Eddie there are two types of amnesia: psychological and organic. Well, he's got the organic sort. For whatever that's worth.

As you know, The Crooked Way is based on Robert Monroe's radio play ""No Blade Too Sharp."" Its plot propels Eddie Rice to Los Angeles where he learns from jump that he's persona non grata there. John Alton's moody photography helps to pound in how inhospitable Los Angeles is to our amnesiac. It's a city what's populated by pushy cops and vindictive hoodlums and dames with shifty allegiances. Turns out, Eddie was a hardened crook in his past life. And, even after all these years, his demented old gangster pard, Vince Alexander (Sonny Tufts), nurses an almighty grudge against old Eddie Riccardi. (Rice isn't our boy's real surname, how about that?) Somewhere in the past, Eddie did Vince a dirty. But someone give Sonny Tufts a sedative. Guy's foaming at the mouth. My way of saying that Tufts did a great job playing the vicious heel.

Ellen Drew plays sultry nightclub canary Nina Martin, and she does it with enough ambivalence at the start that you weren't quite sure which side she's backing. But, oboy, she's a femme fatale what's sure easy on the eyes.

It's crime drama. It's film noir. Half the film is cloaked in dramatic shadow. It's got that dark and dangerous Mickey Spillane vibe. And even though John Payne's most memorable movie is A Miracle on 34th Street, he's so wired into this movie, you buy him as a hard guy trying to navigate a treacherous urban landscape. I enjoyed this movie. It's neat to see what Los Angeles looked like back in the day. It made me hearken back to a bygone era where noirish folks wore trenchcoats and fedoras and smoked tons and pistol-whipped each other and talked tough in that clipped, old-timey dialogue. Good times.",1524268800,,2622,5.020689655172414
