8011346,2,B0001ENX7C,"the Albert King DVD was excellent, this was lame, it didn't have the feel or the sound of BB. You would be better off getting BB Kings DVD.",1378252800,,139,4.0
8011347,4,B0001ENX7C,"In this (1 hour 36 minute) DVD, guitarist Andy Aledort demonstrates how to perform portions of many of B. B. King's greatest songs. Mr. Aledort is an excellent instructor. He very clearly and precisely communicates what he is doing, and he slows down his demonstration enough to follow along. I like how he can break down a rift into little pieces (which then become easy enough to learn), then puts the pieces together for the entire rift.

This instruction is for the advanced guitarist. You should know keys (notes in any key), all major scale patterns, all minor pentatonic scale patterns, and all notes on the fretboard. You should be an expert at string bends, hammer-on, pull-off, and (of course) vibrato.

Songs (Intro and Solo):
- You Upset Me Baby
- Cryin' Won't Help You
- Sweet Little Angel
- You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now
- Rock Me Baby
- Five Long Years
- Just Like A Woman
- The Thrill Is Gone

There are two reasons why I gave this review a four star rating (instead of five).
(1) The DVD does not provide detailed instruction of B. B. King's (signature) vibrato. I feel this is a major deficiency. The instructor should have spent at least 15 minutes on this technique. I once saw a video of B. B. King explaining his vibrato technique. This DVD should have had a similar demo.
(2) The DVD should come with a PDF file that shows the licks represented in both sheet music and tab.

~ The DVD covers the following 8 of the 16 songs discussed in the book/CD package:  * Cryin' Won't Help You * Five Long Years * Just Like A Woman * Rock Me Baby * Sweet Little Angel * The Thrill Is Gone * You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now * You Upset Me Baby.
~ The book/CD package gives detailed written analysis of introductions and solos, but is of course limited to what can be conveyed in writing or via musical example.  The advantage of the DVD is that Andy demonstrates with camera close-ups and verbal descriptions all of the subtle details of how to finger and play in the style of B.B. King.  The disadvantage of the DVD is that much of it goes by rather quickly.  Yes, you can hit the rewind button and go back through the example again, but even with that feature sometimes things are not perfectly clear.  My recommendation is that if you are a beginner or intermediate level guitar player, you should purchase both the book/CD and the DVD if you are serious about learning the style of B.B. King.  If you are an advanced player, you can probably get away with just the DVD (which does not include any transcripts.)
~ Another item of interest related to this DVD and the companion book/CD is the Hal Leonard Guitar Play-Along book/CD ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B-B-King-Guitar-Play-Along-Volume-100/dp/1423451937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B.B. King: Guitar Play-Along Volume 100</a>"".  Although the transcriptions in ""Play-Along #100"" and ""The Definitive Collection"" differ slightly, they are close enough to allow any guitarist to reconcile the differences.  The transcripts in the ""Play-Along #100"" book include everything B.B. plays, not just select segments.  Also, the accompanying CD allows you to play the entire song.

King: Guitar Play-Along Volume 100</a>.
~ Bottom line: This DVD plus the companion book/CD and the ""Play-Along #100"" book/CD will provide guitar players of all levels with an excellent place to start learning how to play the music of B.B. King.",1339286400,2,2942,6.239506172839506
