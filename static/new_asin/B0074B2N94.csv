8509696,4,B0074B2N94,"If you traveled back in time about 70 years and watched a burlesque show (way before my time too), this is what would be on the stage. Back in the days before breast implants, the acts consist of gals finding entertaining ways to remove their costumes to music. No real nudity - at most they go down to pasties and g-strings but usually more than that remains covered. Between the dance numbers are comic acts, routines that the Marx brothers and Abbott & Costello borrowed from and did better. Six shows. About 7 hours all together with all but the last 10 minutes in black and white. Historically interesting. Photo quality is about as good as black and white film of that time is going to be - certainly not HD quality. If you are looking for actual nudity, this isn't the one that you want. But it is entertaining and way cheaper than a trip to strip club.",1463702400,2,860,4.415094339622642

8509699,5,B0074B2N94,"I don't know, maybe I was born too late, but entertainment from bygone eras is my beverage of choice, like well aged wine, and this sampling of six vintage girlie shows from Something Weird/Image Entertainment goes down mighty smooth for anyone with a discriminating taste in tease.

Produced when bump and grind had as much sugar as spice, these black and white films exhibit an 'innocence' and sense of fun that was lost once sex could only be expressed with the one note drumbeat of sleaze. This was a time before artificial body augmentation, anorexia, and tattoos became all the rage. The gals are refreshingly natural and 'do their thing' with class, individual style and grace, and still manage to generate plenty of steam. The comedy skits are broad, with an off-the-cuff quality that makes them delightfully charming to watch. And yes, at times the baggy pants routines are still pretty hilarious.

 The lineup of performers includes the top names in the business during Burlesque's Golden Age, which was already winding down by the '50s. You'll see legendary stars like Jennie Lee, Tempest Storm (who performs a hot number in gorgeous Eastman color), Gay Dawn, Mae Blondell and Misty Ayers, as well as old time comics Leon DeVoe, Eddie Ware, George ""Beetlepuss"" Lewis and Bennie Moore, among others.

On this two-disc compilation we have MIDNIGHT FROLICS (1949), EVERYBODY'S GIRL (1950), FRENCH FOLLIES (1951), ""B"" GIRL RHAPSODY (1952), THE A-B-C'S OF LOVE (1953), and A NIGHT IN HOLLYWOOD (1953). All appear to be transferred off 35mm material, and look and sound terrific, especially given their age and rarity.

All in all, this sumptuous smorgasbord of classic beauty and buffoonery is well worth picking up for anyone who appreciates nostalgia, and a less complicated form of entertainment that serves as a heckuva pleasant diversion to unwind with after a long day.

Highly recommended. Yowza!",1404172800,5,1909,5.102564102564102
8509700,5,B0074B2N94,"This is a treasure trove for fans of vintage burlesque. You get six whole features full of striptease and baggy pants comics. This is old-fashioned striptease - g-strings and pasties stay on - but there is lots of jiggling and bumping and grinding. This was an art form all its own with each performer bringing her own style to it, from elegant to sassy to athletic. The highlight is the appearance by the legendary Tempest Storm in the final film - ""A Night in Hollywood"" (1953) - in gorgeous colour! The rest of that film and all of the rest are in black and white. A large part of the appeal of these films is to travel back in time to a very different era, and this is especially evident in the songs and comic sketches. Be prepared! Some of the singing is not pleasant. And some of the comedy will have you groaning. But there are also a few genuinely funny routines, some of them including jokes which are still in wide circulation today. And one has to admire the verbal and physical skills of some of the comedians even when they are trying to bring life to routines that need to be put of their misery.",1386115200,5,1111,4.346153846153846
8509701,4,B0074B2N94,This video has six black and white films showing showing six burlesque shows from 1949 to 1953 put out by the Something Weird Video company. The strippers usually strip down to what appears to be flesh colored bra's - a lot of the time with pasties covering their nipples - and g-strings or panties. The movies run from 61 minutes to 83 minute long.,1358467200,6,349,4.46875
