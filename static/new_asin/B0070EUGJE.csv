8507761,5,B0070EUGJE,"Great movie, superior to ""The Competition"" in many ways. Tim Draxl is a winning personality, trying his best, yet ... The piano work is well done; all pianists look as though they are doing their actual playing, especially one scene with Travis Fimmel where I cannot believe it is not he playing that piano so beautifully. Very good ending, surprising, dear, and memorable.",1504310400,,373,4.936507936507937
8507762,4,B0070EUGJE,"I enjoyed it but, I found it just a little hard to follow. I also think that twenty-somethings would enjoy it more than my fifty+ age bracket. It's about competitive classical piano with two or three front runners. The winner of the big competition becomes notable in big city concert halls and his or her career becomes significant. The losers are doomed to become instructors which in their youthful thinking is like settling and a waste of their entire training.",1427414400,,465,4.825
8507763,4,B0070EUGJE,"Good portrayal of how competition effects performance.  How sometimes we focus so hard on something, it actually hinders our progress.  And how sometimes people we meet either enhance or detract from our musical emotion.",1397692800,,220,5.4411764705882355
8507764,2,B0070EUGJE,"""Ivory""on paper would have looked like Academy Award material. The reality is very different, the film is a hodge podge full of fine performances and good intentions. Central to the success of the film is Tim Draxl's superb performance as the young concert pianist attempting to navigate the world around  him. The problem is, there is a lack of conflict in the film and we end up with a performance that is not supported by a driven and interesting story.",1351728000,2,456,4.7
8507765,5,B0070EUGJE,"Watching this movie at a ""film party,"" my friends and I were blown away and glued to our seats all at the same time. The story was full of suspense and the acting was amazing! We could relate to the students and the college environment, where competition can almost become a blood sport. The surprising ending caught us completely off guard. This is a MUST SEE movie.",1335139200,3,367,4.492537313432836
