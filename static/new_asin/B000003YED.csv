7903211,2,B000003YED,I bought this because I thought it was a version of Lilac Time.  It is not.  It is an unconvincing story with very little to commend it musically.,1360800000,,146,4.178571428571429
7903212,5,B000003YED,"Richard Tauber has been gone for almost 65 years but, happily, through whatever incarnation those old 78 rpm records are in today, and through these black and white star vehicles so characteristic of the 30's and 40's, we still get a chance to hear and see one of the most distinctive tenors of the 20th century.
Happily, though a typical British production of the period (in which the Hitchcock and a few other productions were unique for their quality)Tauber is cast in a part which he fits phyically and which is within his range as a screen actor (not easy to do with opera singers trained to hit the top balcony with their voices and, in those pre-tv days, to make gestures which could be seen in the same seats).
In this purely imaginative reconstruction from the life of Franz Schubert (Tauber), he is given ample opportunity to sing, of which he takes full advantage. The story  is not embarrassing nor is most of the acting of the supporting players though the lovers he is seen to help go to the lips 0f that crevasse.
All in all, time well spent to see Schubert songs given the master's touch.",1246838400,5,1104,4.547738693467337
7903213,5,B000003YED,"Richard Tauber portrays an incident in Franz Schuberts life and this gives his magnificent voice the opportunity to be displayed in all of it's glory. The background music all by Schubert is simply wonderful. Yes it is a period piece and maybe a bit corny but any lover of great art will thrill to this tape.
