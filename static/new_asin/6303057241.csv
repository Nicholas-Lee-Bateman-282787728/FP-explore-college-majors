This movie is the best scifi horror movie ever. Nuff Said!  Buy this movie and you will fall in love with it I know I have.",1106524800,3,314,3.671641791044776
559745,2,6303057241,"The main concept for this movie is certainly a good one, and it is the concept that will be talked about for a while. Unfortunately it has not been worked out properly.

The idea is simple, some strange serial killer kills people that are in an addressbook. He ends up as a computerprogram and tries to kill that woman from ""Raiders of the lost Ark"" and her son. He starts with some people in her addressbook, those scenes are pretty gruesome. She is hlped by that rightwing guy from American Beauty who is a renowned hacker. Thanks to a 'great' idea they get the job done.

As I said before, the concept will last a while. The acting jobs done will not. The special effects are sometimes really bad and I do think they could have done better in 1993.

A Magnetic end indeed, but for other reasons.",1095984000,,798,4.378378378378378
559746,3,6303057241,"The concept of a serial killer's soul living inside a computer is a frightening and interesting theme.  However, director Rachel Talalay doesn't infuse this movie with enough tension and surprises.  Karen Allen stars as a single mother who makes the mistake of leaving her address book at the store where the serial killer works.  He is planning to return it to her, and kill her of course, but he is in a horrible accident, placed in an MRI, a storm comes, and kaboom somehow his soul remains alive in the computer and he accesses Allen's address book and starts killing them off.  Allen, a competent actress, does okay with her role, but it's not developed enough to place a lot of concern for her well being.  Chris Mulkey (Hidden) stars as computer hack Bram Walker, whose career got halted when he hacked into the IRS and gave all the residents of each state .05 extra on their return.  Mulkey has a brooding handsomeness, and a good screen presence, but isn't given a lot to do.  Wil Horneff as Allen's teenage son has just reached puberty and he and his friend pay their sexy babysitter 37 dollars to unbutton her blouse.  Of course, by the end of the film, Horneff is placed in jeopardy and the serial killer threatens our heroes lives in the college computer room.  Ted Marcoux as the serial killer isn't given enough screen time to truly intimidate the audience, but his brief time is effective.

GHOST IN THE MACHINE is a 1993 film, and the special effects for that time period are fairly inventive.

This is certainly not a rotten tomato, but it might have been better with more assured pacing and direction.",1090972800,8,1620,4.629370629370629
559747,2,6303057241,"gone bad.  This film was not completely terrible but it is no horror classic, I don't even think it's much of a horror movie -- It isn't scary, or gory, or suspenseful.  It had potentional but it just kind of fell flat on it's face.
Karen Allen, (Raiders of the lost arc, Scrooged, and Animal House), plays the single mother who's computerized address book is being used by the ""soul"" of the serial killer.  he kills off her friends that are in the book.
I can see why this is a ""straight to video"" movie.  The acting wasn't any worse than most horror movies, but the execution of the film is just poor.  If you are a real horror film buff, watch Nightmare on elm street as opposed to this.  The killer is actually scary!  ...",1004486400,4,726,4.294117647058823

I am not sure if it is available for rental. There are graphic special effects of folks getting done in and that maynot be suitable for young viewers. Don't run Ghost in the machine in the presence of young children. If you have a strong stomach for simulated death scenes, then well, go for it.",1395187200,,474,4.277777777777778
559831,4,6303057241,Yay another cool old horror movie. Sure it's dated but it was a fun ride and I look forward to seeing it again.,1356220800,,111,3.869565217391304
559832,3,6303057241,"There is little I can add to what has already been said about Ghost in the Machine. It has some amusing surprises that other reviewers do not discuss (like the death of a man at an automobile crash test site that plays with suspense very well and ends with an amusing surprise). What makes the film particularly interesting is how appliances are used to provide point-of-view shots and how they kill people in some innovative and occasionally quite grisly ways, creating an us-and-them scenario that works really well (something that doesn't work so well in King's Maximum Overdrive) and creates a palpable sense of unease. Without getting too carried away, it does for whitegoods what Jaws did for swimming.

Ghost in the Machine appeared at a time when slasher films had become so pass that creative death sequences had become pretty much their only attraction. Its hardly surprising then to learn that Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare helmer Rachel Talalay also directed this film as it likewise has its fair share of creative and icky death sequences. On a side note, Freddy's Dead is unfairly a much maligned film - mainly because of the appalling 3D sequence at the end - which was done despite Talalay's protests. If anyone is to be blamed for that debacle, its Robert Shaye and Aron Warner. It's nice that Talalay was given a second chance with Ghost in the Machine as it showed she has some directing chops, which she proved again in 1995 with the outlandish Tank Girl (the film that gave Naomi Watts an inroad into Hollywood filmmaking that led to her break through role in Mulholland Drive four years later). Tank Girl was Talalay's last feature film and ever since the mid-90s she has been very busy directing for television.

Much has been said about the dated special effects from 1993, particularly the computer animated effects in the final climax, but these were cutting edge for their time and they still look pretty cool, particularly in comparison to the onslaught of cheap and nasty CGI FX used today, such as you might find in Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus and its ilk (one could easily criticise Terminator 2: Judgement Day of some pretty hokey CGI - such as when the T1000 emerges from the truck crash inferno - but again, these were effects created at a time when there were specific limitations to this emerging technology and they stand as competently made artefacts of a particular age). I recall reading about how the CGI effects in Ghost in the Machine were achieved in FX magazine (where it was the feature story) and when I saw the film on its initial theatrical release, I remember being really impressed by what had been achieved. Ghost in the Machine is hardly an original concept. Wes Craven's films, Shocker and Deadly Friend both play with similar Frankensteinian ideas and have a great sense of humour, and Virtuosity (starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crow) which comes from the same period (1995) likewise pushes the envelope of what CGI was capable of at that time. Despite not being an original concept, Ghost in the Machine is nevertheless a really fun addition to the science fiction/horror genre and well worth a look for intrepid cinephiles.",1329177600,3,3193,4.83546617915905
559833,4,6303057241,"Okay, by today's standards, this film may seem dated. However, I liked it. But you may never look at computers the same way again. Karen Allen plays a mother who doesn't like modern technology...let's just say in this film, she has good reason.
There's a serial Killer loose in town, but before he can get to his next victim, he gets into an accident, and taken to the hospital....just before he dies, his soul is transferred to a computer. Still with me, so far? This movie has an interesting idea, but hardly original nowadays. However, director Rachel Talalay of Freddy's Dead, makes it look possible, yet we hope it isn't. The new murders are rather clever, the special f/x look dated but cool, nonetheless, give it a shot, you may like it.",1311638400,3,744,4.643939393939394

559836,5,6303057241,"Ghost In The Machine is a really interesting dive into the techno-slasher sub-genre. I was really surprised when i picked up the DVD and watched the film. It's a really underappreciated piece of cinema from lest we forget, the woman behind Freddy's Dead The final Nightmare. I think she's come on in leaps and bounds from that trash. Ghost in the machine offers interesting sequences and camera shots and the acting was mostly competant. Effects-wise, some of the cyberspace CG is a bit dated but still neat and all of the practical effects such as a gruesome microwave radiation scene stand up as being very noteworthy. The situations Talahay manages to create here are really creative. One such scene involves a boy being trapped in a swimming pool as the cover closes. Along with the creativity of the thrilling sequences as Karl puts his victims through their paces as the ghost in the machine are the variety in atmosphere in the given scenes. Some, such as a crash dummy scene provoke real tension. Others, such as a cremation-gone-wrong are actualy rather terrifying whilst one in particular involving a hand dryer actually made me laugh and then scold myself for laughing as something quite horrible happened to a man who's only crime was lighting his cigar with a candle and looking like a bit of jerk doing it.
Ghost In The Machine is an overlooked cult film that is quite enjoyable if you give it a chance. Definitely look into picking this up if you are a fan of slasher movies as some elelments are akin to films such as Final Destination but also if you are someone who just wants to add some mindless fun to their collection and can sit through a movie without griping about the fact that computer signals cant manifest themselves in electrical current and overload a microwave. The film is fun and yet it works as a horror/thriller and this is most certainly one movie i would be overjoyed to see given a re-imagining.",1250467200,3,1934,4.707964601769912
559837,2,6303057241,"How many movies have been made about a serial killer coming back from the dead to kill again? ""Shocker"" and ""Jack Frost"" are just to name a couple, each better than this movie. This movie just offers nothing more than what has been done a hundred times, but this movie is still a little more enjoyable than ""Jack Frost 2"". The acting is alright, but the death scenes aren't that interesting and neither is the plot. I actually almost feel asleep on more than one occasion, I think may actually have at one point. Not scary at all and no real good death scenes, the best out of all death scenes is when electricity makes a man boil. Even the end of the movie was unimpressive. Overall, a movie few would enjoy, especially not worth buying.",1187049600,,738,4.4338235294117645
