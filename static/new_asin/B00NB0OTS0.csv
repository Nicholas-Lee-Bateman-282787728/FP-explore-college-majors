6631432,5,B00NB0OTS0,This DVD is great! I just started Belly Dancing and Jacquita moves and teaches so beautifully. I wanted to find more DVDs by her but I guess this is the only one I could find. Wish she taught where we live.,1422489600,5,206,4.048780487804878

6631445,3,B00NB0OTS0,"It is set up like all other basic Element DVDs. I am able to follow it because I'm used to the type of instruction from their Yoga DVDs. But for a friend of mine, it was hard to her to understand what she meant sometimes. Overall, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't as engaging as I'd hoped. They should stick to Yoga. ;3",1453680000,,314,4.0
6631446,5,B00NB0OTS0,"Jacqui Lalita is not only a brilliant teacher in person, but her style transcends well in this awesome workout routine! I truly enjoy the atmosphere she creates and am completely inspired by her! I would love to see more.

P.s. Her poetry books are also amazing. I personally enjoy Romancing the Divine.",1453334400,,303,4.826923076923077

6631448,2,B00NB0OTS0,"I wasn't a big fan of this video. I rented it on Amazon instant video and got so bored that I didn't even finish it. I really like the Element Ballet Conditioning video, but this one didn't hold my attention. I've danced different types of dance for many years, but I'm pretty new to belly dance. Still, this video was too basic and slow, and the music was boring. It doesn't hold a candle to real, live shimmy-fit classes.",1441584000,2,423,4.367088607594937
6631449,5,B00NB0OTS0,"Excellent for learning basics technique. She is an excellent teacher and a beautiful dancer and Ihave seen some of the best.  I recommend  this to anyone who is a beginner. Also, to keep those moves honed and sharp.",1435708800,9,215,4.631578947368421
6631450,4,B00NB0OTS0,very fun & explanatory.  Have  not built up to the level  of flexiblitly of instructor but may over time I can.,1426982400,2,111,4.190476190476191
6631451,5,B00NB0OTS0,Great for beginners.,1425340800,2,20,6.0
6631452,5,B00NB0OTS0,"I haven't watched the entire video yet, just the first couple of lessons and I enjoyed them.  She starts with very basic moves (which are complicated to me) and breaks each movement down so that I can ""master"" it.  The exercises are quite a workout.  Easy to work along with, makes me feel like I'm really doing something.",1424736000,9,322,4.517241379310345
6631453,5,B00NB0OTS0,"Found this instructional belly dance video to be helpful in learning belly dance. Jacqui Lalita is a beautiful talented belly dancer and her instructions were clear and easy to follow.  Her beauty, grace and sweet sensuality in teaching made me want to continue learning belly dance. She is a great role model to all women. I am hoping for another DVD by her.",1423008000,7,359,4.698412698412699

8677101,5,B00NB0OTS0,A must purchase. Just got done dancing.,1474502400,,39,4.714285714285714
8677102,5,B00NB0OTS0,I love this workout and I love Jacqui Lalita. She's a great instructor and dances really nicely. It's a joy working out with her. Her workout helped me with the pelvis pain. The workout is a light workout for me. But I like that because it's like a meditation. The slow movements help me tune in and focus on my body and any points of tension. I wish she had more workouts!,1468540800,2,373,4.194444444444445
8677103,5,B00NB0OTS0,"I have purchased numerous belly dance instructional cds which I love to use.  Yet it is THIS ONE that I seem to go back to again and again because Jacqui Lalita's technique and manner are so pleasant and relaxed -- and, from the start, she turns routine exercises into feeling like dancing.  I don't know how she does it, but she is masterful!",1468108800,3,343,4.428571428571429
8677104,2,B00NB0OTS0,The video really doesn't give you instruction.,1457481600,,46,5.714285714285714
8677105,5,B00NB0OTS0,"Wow, beautiful scenery to look at while activating my inner belly dancer.  Surprised how Jacqui seamlessly wove so much content into one DVD.
The instruction was so clear, I finally got, how to do an undulation, correct cueing of right and left was so helpful.  I am doing the Dance Foundations every day and like that there are two routines to choose from, the Slow and Sensual feeds my flexibility,  the Belly Burn, fires my energy.  I feel so inspired to learn this Beautiful...Feminine Art Form.  Thank you Jacqui Lalita, please do another DVD.",1457308800,4,548,4.787234042553192
8677106,5,B00NB0OTS0,"Lalita is amazing. Tough workout on hips, butt and abs easy to follow as you learn steps. No hyper extensions of back meaning no backward leaning common in other videos. Motivating and approachable. Belly dancers are not skinny dancers, not intimidating to beginners. No complicated arms. If you're out of shape you can do this, but you will be tired at the end. When you will tone up you will still want to belly dance. It is a fun art form and culturally sensitive.",1456617600,5,467,4.571428571428571
8677107,5,B00NB0OTS0,Love it !!,1456531200,,10,2.6666666666666665
