2434707,5,B000BP8IJY,I saw this on TV and was intrigued . It is an absolute masterpiece in my view. It is unique in style and a film I wanted to show all my friends. If you are fed up with the Hollywood film formula and tend to watch films from Europe and other parts of the world you will really enjoy this. I am a bit of a film buff and couln't get my hands on this DVD soon enough. I gave it to an Asian friend of mine as a gift. She loved it. Every so often we accidentally come across a real gem of a movie. Tears of the Black Tiger is one of those rare gems. A love story/western/Asian style all mixed up. And a tear jerker near the end.,1331596800,,622,3.7557251908396947
2434708,5,B000BP8IJY,"A great little film that is part sentimental nostalgia film, part John Woo ripoff, part John Wayne, and part homoerotic romp. Crazy colours, amazing ricochet bullet.  ""Did you catch that? If not, we'll play it again."" Vintage stylish credits roll five minutes into the film, with cheezy song. Cheesy showdown on what looks like a theatre stage between Dum (the hero) and Mahesuan (one of the villains). Dum shoots the snake instead of Mahesuan.  Ten years ago, at Ban Plana Station, there's old train footage, and then the gorgeous ""Sala Awaiting The Maiden"", with its central scenes. The water turns ridiculously red after the fight. The filmmaker uses constant rain, at least in the intense scenes (confrontation, battle, etc.). The moon scar that Dum got from Koh, the broken flute, the hankie and the harmonica. Then there are the comedic scenes: ""Did you say goodbye to your wife?"" ""Yes, sir, all seven of them."" There's the crazy blood brother oath, and all of the battles - the best fighters seem to always kill two men with one bullet. How? We've already had one ""Ten years ago"" scene, here comes another ""One year ago"" scene, which shows our star-crossed lovers' reunion in Bangkok, when he pretends to not remember her. Then there's the attempted rape by Koh, and of course the rescue by Dum. The movie finally gets serious, and seriously good, with the lyrics of the end that tie it all together. ""Love is like a bull corralled/ Captured but untamed/ He'll buck and charge for freedom/ Love will not be held."" The two lovers on the beach speak with their thoughts, everything is symbolic (art house crowds love that, it's the language they speak). The gang ambushes the wedding, they even bring their midget on a pony.  What a cowboy gang!

Dum is betrayed again and again - when will he ever learn? She and the captain have their heads tied together, what a sad wedding. Dum looks into her eyes and tells of the ambush. Now the captain knows. After he sees the light, he becomes a bad guy, smokes like Fai. Of course, at the ambush at the end, it is raining heavily. The palace looks like Salzburg International Preparatory School, where I went for two years. Great cheezy scene during the rainy shootout, while Dum and Mahesuan stare each other down in the rain, there is a crescent moon above Dum (remember his scar?), and we see a shooting star flare through the sky. Also the rain falls only on Dum's face, Mahesuan's face is dry. And why not?

Throughout the movie the sad song intervenes from time to time, and there is the image of wildflowers choosing that time to fall, they all fall. At the end, they are two pictures side by side, the star-crossed lovers cannot meet, they are permanently on both sides of it all.",1314316800,,2736,4.6563146997929605
2434709,5,B000BP8IJY,"Combine several Thai cinematic arts forms from the past, Thai Likay theater, an American, Sergio Leone (at least one scene references Once Upon a Time in the West) and Thai western influence, a beautiful but bizarre palate of pastel and harsh colors, extreme violence, melodrama, songs, non-linear storyline and you get the unique Tears of the Black Tiger. It was a box office flop in Thailand though it did later help spawn a novel based on the script and a radio play. It was even shown at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. After hearing about this for years I finally got to watch this and I am glad I did. It is quite an uncommon viewing experience.

Chartchai Ngamsan (The Tsunami Warrior; he also worked with Wisit in a Thai Wrangler Jean commercial, you have to see it) is Dum the Black Tiger a taciturn good guy working as the number one henchman for a bad gang dressed like cowboys in a b-western clothes led by Fai who has no mercy for those who cross him. Fai's former number one is Mahesuan (Supakorn Kitsuwon: Ong Bak 2), Dum's blood brother who has a laugh like a Shaw Brother's villain and a completely forced deep voice which is hilarious (and a good reason to stay away from the English dub). He is jealous towards Dum because of his quicker draw and the fact he lost his highest standing with Fai.

Dum is a peasant lower caste boy who fell in love with a high caste Supanburi province politician's daughter Rumpoey (Stella Malucchi) in his youth and has pined the years away loving her. They both have not forgotten each other. Years later they re-found each other, but she has a forced engagement to a police captain because of her father. This does not stop him from protecting her from local ruffians and from them both loving each other. But she does not know he is a criminal. Will this affect her affection?

There are some lulls in the storyline which goes over the romantic triangle too long, though I have to admit it did make you feel (sometimes frustrated) for the doomed romance. Action aficionados might be more annoyed by this that I was. There are also some plot issues with attempted suicides, character changes and situations that sometimes felt forced or not belonging to the plot -- though to be fair, the film was never meant to be realistic.

The strengths outweigh the negatives though. This is a particularly peculiar film and I do not often see films that take as many chances as this one and not end up a befuddled mess. It is a lot of fun with its bizarre mixture of comedy, action and romance. I feel several scenes are so interesting that I do not want to spoil them by describing them to those who have not seen this. Tears of the Black Tiger is a beautifully directed movie with an engaging use of non-realistic colors, painted expressionistic backdrops and some of the most interesting cinematography choices I have seen since Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985). While I have seen a decent amount of Thai cinema it has been mostly relegated to Thai action cinema of Tony Jaa, Dan Chupong and Panna Rittikrai with a few art and epic films thrown in. This is now among my favorites from that country along with Ong Bak and Tom Yum Goong. Now I have to find Wisit Sasantieng's next film Citizen Dog.

Make sure you get the uncut version (110m) of the film such as the Magnolia R1 release (2007), luckily they were able to save this from Mirimax who had sat on the rights to this movie for over five years, which besides the Thai language release (both 2.0 and 5.1 mixes) also has an English dub (both 2.0 and 5.1 mixes) and a ""Making of TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER"" extra TV special that is 45 minutes long. It is a great extra with the production team, the actors discussing everything related to the making of the film. There is much discussion of past Thai cinema which is useful to anyone learning more about the older cinematic days there. The cut version takes out the extreme violence which I think hurts the flow of the film since there are some integral scenes that were shortened.",1314144000,,4036,4.515731874145007
2434710,5,B000BP8IJY,"Tears of the Black Tiger is an amazing and ground breaking film.  Fans of low-budget films that push the limitations of their situations to create unique works of entertainment/art deserved to be seen by a wider audience!
  I am excited because this film, along with Nang Nak, introduced me to Thai Cinema.. and now I want to see more!  Does anyone know if Yam Yasothorn will be available in the United States soon?  Or where I can find the soundtrack to this film?  Fans of this film should check out 6ixtynin9 by Pen-ek Ratanaruang as well!  Enjoy...",1206057600,,552,4.628865979381444
2434711,4,B000BP8IJY,"Thai cinema has certainly come a long way in recent years.  ""Bangkok Dangerous"" and ""Last Life in the Universe"" are just two of the more interesting Thai films of the past decade.  Now comes ""Tears of the Black Tiger,"" a stylistic hybrid that brings together the cinematic excesses of Douglas Sirk and Sergio Leone, with a smattering of Quentin Tarrentino.  Its director, Wisit Sasanatieng certainly wears his influences on his sleeve!  The storyline and dialogue are strictly from hunger, but the voice-over narration can be hauntingly beautiful.  It involves a poor boy who falls in love with the governor's daughter.  They are separated in childhood and then reunited as adults.  In the meantime, the girl has become engaged to a policeman, and the boy has linked up with a band of outlaws and is now known as the Black Tiger.  His male-bonding with one of the outlaws is reminiscent of the Monty Clift/Arthur Kennedy relationship in ""Red River.""  It's all very cliched and yet strikingly original (I half expected a Brokeback angle).  The music is folkish, the colors pastel, and the violence over the top.  But somehow it makes an impression; this is a film that will continue to haunt me.",1200096000,,1194,4.890547263681592
2434712,5,B000BP8IJY,"That's because Thailand is all that, and much more.

The five stars are because I love Thailand. If I could, I've have given it ten stars. But because of barrage of melodramatic - okay, corny - cliches, the cacophony of tossing everything familiar film trick into a cinematic blender, imposing the unique Thai logic, making incredible production gaffs first year film students would avoid and the really misleading hype of its marketing, I just can't. It's not clever parody nor artistic exaggeration; it's just seems an adolescent idea of such. Then too, Amazon just wouldn't allow 10 stars anyway.

Well, 'Mai Pen Rai'. Support this movie as a homage to Thai cinematic growing pains. That Thai phrase means 'Never mind, it doesn't matter'.
Oh, and the art direction, a Thai forte, is real pretty.

Better to recommend THE LEGEND OF SURIYOTHAI. It's as colorful and imbibed with Thai spirit, but less of a parody in a blender. And more informative re Thai history, too.",1184889600,,970,4.902439024390244
2434713,5,B000BP8IJY,"outstanding flick.  i expect most viewers not to ""get it,"" more's the pity to them (come on now, thai culture's not THAT alien to you all, is it?).  visually breathtaking, maniacally acted and directed.  deserves a wider audience and more appreciation than it's sure to get, sadly...",1181260800,,283,4.9787234042553195
2434714,5,B000BP8IJY,"The previews were intriguing, and the movie is so expressive it is surprising. I know the cultures of the Pac-Rim are old and in many ways sophisticated, but the adapatation of their esthetic to our genre is fun, cool and engaging. And, damn, the story is not half bad! It is not entirely a spoof, just that those cultures stylize for high esthetic goals, and this movie gets that treatment in the most unexpected dimensions of color, slow-motion, sound, and close-ups. Too good to not have in the collection!",1181174400,,509,4.730337078651686
2434715,2,B000BP8IJY,"**1/2

In this age in which just about every other film seems to be a sequel, adaptation or remake of a previous work, it seems positively ungrateful, not to mention counterproductive, to criticize a movie for being TOO innovative and creative - yet that is exactly the case with ""Tears of the Black Tiger,"" a movie that is a mixture of so many different genres and styles that it is virtually impossible to explain what it is like to anyone who hasn't actually seen it.

Indeed, if the term, in and of itself, were not self-contradictory and meaningless, one might be tempted to call ""Tears"" a ""Chinese Italian Western,"" seeing as it draws much of its look and style from those ""spaghetti westerns"" that Clint Eastwood made his name with in the 1960's: ""A Fistful of Dollars, ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.""  Yet, that would be an inadequate description of ""Tears of the Black Tiger"" as well, since the movie also looks like one of those glossy 1950's melodramas by Douglas Sirk, on the order of ""Magnificent Obsession,"" ""Imitation of Life,"" and ""All That Heaven Allows"" (albeit with an all Chinese cast).  It certainly makes for a bizarre hybrid, to say the least, but, despite its originality, this tale of an unlikely romance between a gun slinging outlaw (the Black Tiger) and a classy beauty from the upper classes - who seem to be inhabiting entirely different centuries, let alone entirely different parts of the world - fails to ignite much interest in the viewer.

With its cartoon-like violence, highly stylized settings, arch acting and corny dialogue, the film is obviously intended to be an affectionate send-up of the kind of escapist, popcorn movies Hollywood has been exporting to the world for nearly a century now.  But the movie is too strained to be truly funny, too artificial to be truly involving, with its jumbled, out-of-chronological-order narrative structure finally frustrating the viewer past the point of caring.  The bold, garish colors add to the film's air of surrealism, but most people will probably tire of the movie once the novelty of the concept has worn off.

""Tears of the Black Tiger"" is a film one would like to support and admire, but the sad truth is that, in this case at least, the filmmakers were not able to pull the thing off.  ""Tears of the Black Tiger,"" for all its goodwill and craftsmanship, earns an ""A"" for effort, but a mere ""Gentleman's C-"" for the overall product.",1178150400,,2455,4.75764705882353
2434716,3,B000BP8IJY,"Saw this at the theater and was wowed away by how visually stunning this film is. I was excited to order it on DVD, and received it today, but was disappointed by how low quality the transfer is. The colors are dull and blurry compared to what I saw on the big screen. Total let down because the visuals make the movie.",1177632000,,319,4.161290322580645
2434717,5,B000BP8IJY,"Amazing.  I just saw it in the theater in a limited run on a whim.  There is so much to say about it.  I don't think this film is really for everybody.  If you like Fassbinder, Leone, Pekinpah, Sirk, Itami, Ford, and the like....well, this is for you.  I've never seen anything quite like it(the colors are almost sickening at times), yet it reminded me of so many other films.  It's subtle and obvious at the same time.  Almost every cliche is there, and all of them are handled with deft wit and humor.  I quite liked the musical cues, particularly the scene where the girl replaces the young hero's wooden flute with a harmonica.  The music changes from flute to harmonica at the instant.  And so much of the music is overbearing and melodramatic, like the very precise melodramatic acting.  I'm sure this alone would make most people find it silly or hate it.  Well, it is silly.  But it is a particular kind of silly that takes a very special brain to create.  The picture that I first saw of it convinced me I had to see the movie.  It is from a very theatrical stand-off that was so strange and colorful that you really need to see it for yourself.  There are also a few moments of total absurdity that Stephen Chow fans will really enjoy.  Every time I think of this movie, I smile.",1174608000,,1290,4.352941176470588

2434720,4,B000BP8IJY,"Inadvertently starting a riot at the Cannes Film Festival is probably not the best way to make friends and influence people but it certainly makes for an invigorating evening. It was in 2000 when I was there with a group of `producers' trying to interest wheelers and dealers in a film project when we were suddenly `adopted' by a television crew who attempted to use us as leverage to get themselves into the celebrity laden MTV party. Push quickly came to shove, the security Gestapo got irate and before we knew it, it was war! The fracas in question had, according to news reports, George Clooney and the All Saints cowering under tables. As chairs began to fly and the gendarmes got busy with the batons we escaped the mayhem and stood and watched it from across the rue unaware that there was another, more constructive, upheaval taking place on the Cote D'azure with the first ever entry from Thailand - Tears of the Black Tiger.

  `Tiger' was about to herald in the so called `Thai New Wave' challenging the dominance of Japan and Hong Kong as the prime movers and shakers of Asian cinema - and what an debut!

  A lysergic western that tells the tale of a young man whose family is murdered and so joins up with a gang of bandits with vengeance on his mind. He soon builds a reputation earning him the name Black Tiger. His gang inevitability come into conflict with the local establishment, but when he discovers his childhood sweetheart is to marry a police captain he struggles to maintain peace between the gangs and the authorities but his efforts (much like our film project bid) quickly spiral into untold chaos.

  Taking place between parallel dimensions of a colour-saturated Wild West and contemporary Bangkok, Tears of the Black Tiger is a moving 3D postcard of retro-camp kitsch, and because of this, the sudden explosions of (literally) teeth shattering violence are all the more outrageous. The term `visual feast' seems made for director Wisit Sasanatieng's masterpiece as it takes 50's melodramas, Spaghetti Western's (or should that be Noodle Eastern's?) and Anime action and puts them through the wringer, resulting in a film that embraces as many conventions as it seems to demolish .

  As my own attempts to storm the Bastille of the film industry have, to date, yielded little fruit, I appreciate all the more a film that appears to have flaunted all the rules and has no agenda but its own. `Tears of the Black Tiger' is a brilliant example of revolt sans riot.",1161129600,,2495,4.75
2434721,4,B000BP8IJY,"The first thing you notice about this movie is its color.  Painted with primary hues, the colors in TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER positively pop off the screen and envelope you in a warm embrace.  The use of this surreal palette becomes abundantly appropriate as the offbeat story unfolds.  Certainly, in the history of the cinema there have been a number of Musical Westerns but none so drenched in ultraviolence or coming out of Thailand.

  The plot of this Asian oater doesn't break any new ground.  Boy meets girl.  Boy loses girl.  Boy falls in with bad crowd.  Girl's new fianc swears vengeance to bring down bad crowd.  A quick survey of my DVD shelf shows a few films along those lines.  In this case it's Dum (Chartchai Ngamsan), the young peasant who falls for the Governor's daughter, Rumpoey (Stella Malucchi).  Kept apart by their status (and geography), Dum joins with a band of outlaws.  He proves to be one hell of a shot, specializing in impossibly complex ricochets.  As expected, Dum's loyalties are tested when Rumpoey's new fianc goes after the outlaw gang.  By the end, there's fake blood everywhere and the air is thick with melodrama.  Think Sam Peckinpah meets Douglas Sirk.

  While the story may be rote and the film bogged down at times, TEARS delivers with its themes of love, loyalty, and honor.  Moreover, the over-the-top gunfights, breathtaking sets, and catchy tunes really stick with you.",1149120000,,1419,4.829166666666667

Simply one of the most creative, innovative, brilliant little films ever made. This is a stunning production with a fun, hokey, tacky ""story-line"" that is just surreally amusing and funny.

Blending genres, to a 1940's color tint, with a nostalgic song-soundtrack, Tears of the Black Tiger combines spaghetti western, 40's war movie, Gone With the Wind, The Godfather and a cast of great characters. The pencil-thin mustache outlaw is especially fun to watch as he intentionally over-acts, mugs for the camera, and struts.

Acting is competent, production, filming, direction, and all the rest are just brilliant, under total control of a master director with seemingly limitless powers and talents.
