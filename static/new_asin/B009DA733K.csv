8540174,4,B009DA733K,"This documentary was very informative . Its starts out with a scholarly voice over as documentaries go interspersed with  historical footage, personal home videos of Maria Altmann , lawyers, journalist, ect revealing a picture of the times, attitudes of the Museums and Austria's anti-semitism, and actions of the individuals involved and the proceedings to revert the famous painting back to the Block-Bauer family heirs following the intriguing courtroom drama with both sides playing tug of war.  Candid interviews at the end of the documentary. I highly enjoyed it. A+",1441152000,11,572,5.415730337078652

8540177,2,B009DA733K,I purchased this dvd based on just one review and was very disappointed with it...too many talking heads and not enough substance.  It could not compare with the wonderful book The Lady in Gold.,1398556800,5,194,4.705882352941177
8540178,5,B009DA733K,"Oh, my this is a beautifully crafted visual description of a wonderful historical event.  It is a well-documented addendum to Anne-Marie O'Connor's 2012 book LADY IN GOLD; however, it is worth viewing even if you haven't read the book.  I not only highly recommend the book but also encourage interested persons to purchase RAPE OF EUROPA.  I can only be grateful to the people who produced these films and for having the privilege of owning (and sharing) them!",1376092800,15,461,4.884615384615385
