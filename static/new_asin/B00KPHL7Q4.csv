8660570,1,B00KPHL7Q4,I have to agree with Mr. Steere Jr review. The Alpha DVD quality is awful. Do not bother until a better print turns up. I had to turn this one off and chuck it !,1476662400,,161,3.6285714285714286
8660571,2,B00KPHL7Q4,"Another dreadful presentation from Alpha Video of a poor public domain copy of what MIGHT be a wonderful D.W. Griffith film with the incandescent Mae Marsh.  With all due respect to the reviewer above, it is very difficult to tell how good this film is when the video quality is so awful.  I expect the Alpha Video copy is based on a poor quality 16mm reduction positive.  See www DOT silentera DOT COM for a bit more information.  If you must purchase this, you'd be wise to turn off the musical score.  It is a generic mishmash of inappropriate musical pieces some of which have appeared before in lamentable Alpha Video products.  Let's hope better film elements surface and that a more watchable copy with appropriate music becomes available.  David Shepard, where are you when we need you?  For fans of Mae Marsh, you'd be better off with INTOLERANCE (Cohen Media Group), TRUE HEART SUSIE/HOODOO ANN (Flicker Alley), D.W. Griffith BIOGRAPH SHORTS (Kino), D.W. Griffith YEARS OF DISCOVERY (Flicker Alley) -- all are nicely produced with better video quality and much better musical scores.  Avoid any dvd's from Alpha Video, Classic Video Streams or Grapevine.",1452556800,,1164,4.9282051282051285
8660572,5,B00KPHL7Q4,Mae Marsh and D.W. Griffith made a lot of xcellent movies together and this is one of the best. It shows off Mae's talent as she goes from an poor orphan to the town teaz ( Hence the nickname teazie then to a homeless mother who in the end almost dies. The last scenes of this movie will bring you to tears  This movie runs roughly along the same plot as Way down East but is faster paced and a bit better written. It is both funny and sad. This movie is a real winner and cements Mae's reputation as the best actress of the silent era.,1443830400,,536,4.009345794392523
