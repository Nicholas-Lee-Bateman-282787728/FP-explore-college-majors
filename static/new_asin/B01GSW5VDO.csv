7767642,4,B01GSW5VDO,"The inimitable Bob Newhart is back for another hilarious helping of off-kilter comedy in this 1987-88 Season of the delightfully daffy Emmy-nominated sitcom, with innkeepers, author, and television host Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart) and his spunky wife Joanna (Mary Frann) facing a whole new batch of comic misadventures as they contend with running the Stratford Inn as well as the oddball natives of their quaint remote Vermont town in this sitcom that ran on CBS from 1982-90.

 However, their quirky companions- handyman George Utley (Tom Poston), queasily cutesy couple Michael (Peter Scolari) and Stephanie Van Derkellan (Julia Duffy), and those brothers in buffoonery, Larry (Bill Sanderson), Darryl (Tony Papenfuss), and Darryl (John Voldstad)-are there to ensure that even in their own inn, the Loudons will find no shelter from the storm of silliness that surrounds them.

In the meantime, all you NEWHART fans out there can catch it on Antenna-TV.",1502668800,,954,5.346666666666667

7767656,4,B01GSW5VDO,"The sixth season follows Dick (Bob Newhart) and Joanna Loudon (Mary Frann) further into their adventures at their colonial Vermont inn, as well as Dick's weekly program at the local TV station.

Self-centered, often ditzy maid Stephanie (Julia Duffy) is still going strong with TV station manager Michael (Peter Scolari). They do have their ups and downs, as seen in the two-part ""Til Depth Do Us Part,"" when the two fear they're getting boring.

In ""Me and My Gayle,"" handyman George (Tom Poston) is both terrified and exhilarated by having a chance to reconnect with his high school crush at their 40th reunion.

The hilariously bizarre trio of brothers Larry, Darryl and Darryl (William Sanderson, Tony Papenfuss and John Voldstad) is also up to their usual hijinks, as seen in ""My Three Dads"" when they decide to adopt a child.

And of course, there's the usual array of eccentric and wacky townspeople and guests at the inn -- usually coming by just as Dick is busiest with his latest writing project.

Viewers young and old will enjoy this classic sitcom!",1486339200,,1061,4.872222222222222

This season in particular has one of my favorite episodes, ""A Midseason Night's Dream,"" where all of the main characters each have a dream about their fantasies.

7767678,5,B01GSW5VDO,"I keep saying that someday I need to go back and watch more of Bob Newharts 1970s sitcom.  And every time I think that, I get sidetracked by a new season on DVD of Newhart, his wonderful comedy from the 1980s.  Season 6 is another strong, hilarious season with these characters I love.

If youve missed this sitcom, you are really missing out.  Bob Newhart stars as Dick Loudon, do-it-yourself author who runs the Stratford Inn in Vermont along with his wife Joanna (Mary Frann).  Dick also has a local weekly talk show produced by ultra-yuppie want to be Michael Harris (Peter Scolari).  Michael also happens to be dating the Loudons maid, spoiled but cut off heiress Stephanie Vanderkellen (Julia Duffy).  Rounding out the staff at the inn is handyman George Utley (Tom Poston), whose family has been taking care of the bed and breakfast for generations.  Then there are the neighbors, who run the Minute Man Caf next door  Larry (William Sanderson), his brother Darryl (Tony Papenfuss), and his other brother Darryl (John Volstad).

Over the course of this season, Michael and Stephanie hit a snag in their relationship - they start to feel bored.  And they come up with a surprising way to try to get the spark back.  Larry makes a startling discovery  hes not the oldest in the family.  Meanwhile, he also takes a vacation and leaves George in charge of the Darryls.  The entire town gets alien fever on Halloween.  George decides to pursue his lifelong dream of being a used car salesman.  Dick gets his dream of working with one of the best illustrators in the how do business while Joanna takes on the job of giving the local history speech.

In other words, its a pretty typical season of fun with the gang.  We do get to see more of the townspeople this season, and they are always a delight.  While I complain that most the characters edge toward over the top caricature in the later seasons, they haven't slid too far in that direction yet, and they are still just delightfully over the top here.

Most of the stories this season center around the main cast and the townspeople with very little time devoted to guests.  Having said that, watch for early acting jobs for Bill Maher and Jason Alexander as guests during the season.

And the laughs!  Many of the episodes can make me smile just thinking about them and the fun we have in the time we spend with the characters.  Of course, it helps that by this point these are old friends.  Granted, they are friends we enjoy because we see them on TV (much like Dick, Id be annoyed by some of them in real life), but still, its hard not to love the characters and enjoy spending time laughing with them.

Naturally, this is another case where the actors and the writers are perfectly in sync.  Everyone know the characters, and they do a brilliant job finding ways to get us to laugh whether it is a new joke or a variation on a running gag.

Season 6 consisted of 24 episodes, and they are preserved here on 3 discs.  Theres nothing in the way of extras, but I will gladly take the episodes as they are.  The episodes are full frame and stereo, but this was the 80s after all.  Each disc has a disclaimer that the episodes are from the best source material available.  They may not be as sharp as newer shows, but they are certainly watchable.

In fact, I dare any fan of Newhart to find fault with this set.  Season 6 is delightful laughter at its finest.  Pop in a disc, sit back, and enjoy.",1477267200,4,3454,4.487961476725522
7767679,5,B01GSW5VDO,So happy to get another season of one of my favorite series!,1477180800,,60,4.083333333333333
7767680,1,B01GSW5VDO,"The first five seasons were well written and well acted. They were really funny and fun to watch.  Season six was like another series altogether. We watched about three episodes and put it away. It was actually more like what is suppose to pass for comedy on the networks today: mindless and silly. The laughter was obviously a sound track, else the audience was cued to start and stop laughing instantly.
The series should have ended with season five. Until six, we were waiting for season seven and eight to be released but no longer. Don't waste your money unless the trash on TV today suits your level of entertainment.",1477008000,,623,4.663636363636364

7767684,5,B01GSW5VDO,"Several excellent episodes.  Michael & Stephanie decide a wedding is just the thing to put the sparkle back in their relationship in ""Till Depth Do Us Part"", parts 1 and 2--I loved how a therapist strongly advised the shallow couple to break up.  Then Stephanie discovers someone more shallow (and several IQ points lower) than her in ""A Friendship that Will Last a Lunchtime.""  The ever-popular Larry and his brothers are shocked to discover that a Darryl is the eldest son in ""Prima Darryl"" and later decide to adopt in ""My Three Dads.""  Dick is suspected of being a Martian in ""Take Me to Your Loudon"" and I started laughing hysterically when Dick chose to give in & act the part.  I especially enjoyed seeing a minor character's chance to take center stage in ""Support Your Local Shifflett.""",1476057600,6,795,4.731884057971015
