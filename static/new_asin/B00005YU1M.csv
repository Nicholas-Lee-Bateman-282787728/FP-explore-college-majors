1677108,5,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball is one of those rare movies which come along and envelops the viewer.  The cast alone which includes Billy Bob Thornton, Peter Boyle, Heath Ledger and Halle Berry are cause enough to see the movie but the plot and outcome are further reason to see this fine film and applaud all associated with this movie. While the subject matter at times is rather grim and one may close their eyes for certain scenes, one leaves the theater feeling that this was time well spent.
Billy Bob Thornton plays the son of a law enforcement officer and the father of a young man, also a law enforcement officer.  He comes from a long line of bigoted men which is evident when two young black brothers want to hang out with Thornton's 20 something son. In addition to Thornton not liking blacks he doesn't seem to like his son too much either. Central to the movies plot is the execution of a black man.  As Thornton and the other correction officers including his son prepare this man and then witness the execution, the viewer is likely to think this might be the end of Thornton's involvement with the executed man.  But the execution has serious reprecussions on Thorntons life as a tragedy befalls him and he then meets the  executed mans widow.  And as they begin a rather unusual relationship you as the viewer are held mesmerized by the events unfolding on the screen.
There are parts of this movie which are truly painful to watch
and at times the viewer may find themselves overwhelmingly uncomfortable. But these feelings only further heighten the movies effect as one feels as though they are witnessing real life instead of a story. The performances are wonderful and one leaves the theater with a great deal to think about for some time.  Even the title is a good choice as monster's ball was the term used in England for the party which was held the night before an execution.
Do see this movie!",1007251200,45,1904,4.59882005899705

It seems like they are all numb from the head up. Like all these people live in an unhappy hole.

I don't want to say to much about the movie because everyone's opinion is different but I just thought the movie could have been better if there was an actual plot in the story.

1677217,3,B00005YU1M,"The movie lacked body. It felt disjointed with little continuity between scenes. I thought the acting was good, but the movie might have been better if the director was a little more in tune with the talent they were working with. The sex scene was over played and felt a little gratuitous. I am not sure what the director's intentions were, but the desperation of Halie Barry's character would have been felt even without all the sex in that scene. The strength of the relationship between the inmate and Barry's character was not clear enough to give any relavence to the discovery that Thorton's character was the executioner, I felt that part of the movie was forced.

Ofcourse I loved his performance in Sling Blade, but now my eyes have been opened to his ability to captivate in other roles. I can see why Halle Berry won an Academy Award. She was perfect in her role. The performance by all of the actors in this film is exceptional.

1677303,5,B00005YU1M,"This movie is about how the legacy of racism and poverty in the American South still prevents Southerners from living happy and meaningful lives.
Traditions of racism and punishment are the norm. The relationship between Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry represents an attempt to break free from old mores to create their own separate peace.

The most notable thing about the movie is Halle Berry's Oscar-winning performance, especially the question of whether or not it was deserved. I didn't especially enjoy watching an attractive and talented woman strip buck naked and engage in intercourse with ugly old man Billy Bob Thornton. Director Marc Forster directs their scene in a way that emphasizes detachment and impersonality. The sex in the scene is framed as an attempt to escape the pain of their personal lives, not as an exchange of tenderness and affection. We see sexuality used throughout the movie as a bargaining chip in relationships, so this scene illustrates how past, traditional mores re sex still affect relationships in the present day.

All in all, I'm not sure the Oscar was deserved. There might be some truth that a woman, especially a black woman, has to strip and subject herself to degradation for the Oscar establishment to respect her as an actress. Don't get me wrong--it's an excellent performance in which Berry isn't afraid to dip into the murky depths of her Leticia character, but there's too much melodrama in it to consider it a great performance. Berry's final moments with Thornton--all silence, with very complex emotions played beneath the surface--are easily her finest. Watch the movie, make your own decision.

The movie is shot in a hazy, music video style with lots of deliberate grain. The music by Ashe and Spencer is electronic and ambient and very memorable.",1470528000,,1810,5.046822742474917

1677348,3,B00005YU1M,"The movie could have gone much more explosive. I was hoping to see another angle enter in - the law enforcement officer at the hospital who never seemed to get back concerning the hit and run? Thus you are left with the question: what happened to the investigation? Obvious answer right away would be ""black boy was not important"" but frankly that just doesn't cut it. Having the law enforcement people tie up the connection between Thornton, his son and Letticia's husband would have been much more interesting than a late movie picture session.

Thornton's ""conversion"" and character. Well first he is a gun toting Southern man kicking black kids off of his property. Then he suddenly is ""converted"" based on his son's suicide. To me it just didn't fit.

Add in that at the end you are left with the question: did Thornton do all of the things for Letticia because he was involved in the execution? Or was his prejudice-conversion at work? Or was it real love? Letticia is not convinced but seems to accept it as her role in her new life/pathetic situation.

Sexual scenes ... the obvious use of the domination degrading rear entry position - if you miss this you miss the movie. Right away the hooker assumes this position and it told me right away that white males were going to be portrayed as bigoted, dominating types.

Sorry but I just cannot accept Hank's conversion. The movie would have been a lot better had he remained in form and slowly renounced his views as the movie came to a conclusion.

More comments: where are Hank's co-workers in all of this? Or people he knew? When he takes up with Letticia there are no bigoted actions. Where is the KKK? The usual kind of things you would expect when Hank walked into a bar?

I don't see the connection between the title and the rest of the movie past the execution scene unless the complete breakdown of Hank's family is some sort of poetic justice.

I kept expecting the detective to call Hank or show up and try and tie him in with the hit and run in some way. Or at least reveal to Letticia the connection of Hank and her husband. Frankly the movie needed more characters to interplay with Hank and Letticia to make it come off.

Good performances by the players - weaker script/story.",1460592000,,2249,4.5632754342431765

The performances are simply extraordinary. Halle Berry has the Academy Award very deserved. Billy Bob Thornton gives a perfect level of intensity to his character. Heath Ledger brings an excellent performance. The great Peter Boyle has an excellent and realistic performance. He plays so well his character of a bad guy that I hated his character.

1677406,5,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball was surprising and touching, and I was exhilarated with how much I enjoyed it.  It is absolutely absorbing.

I watched the film after Halle Berry had been nominated for an Oscar (or had won it), and I was impressed with her.  Impressed in the sense that she was credible for most of the time.  I never thought her much of an actress, though she often received praise.  I never thought her bad, but never was her presence worthy enough for me to pay attention.  I thought most of her acclaim from being a Hollywood star.

Halle Berry is beautiful - as she often proclaims - but I never thought she had star presence in a film.  Halle Berry's most impressive scene was the moment before her explicit sex scene - talking hysterically over her curtains then relapsing into the pain over losing her son, then losing herself physcially.  The sex scene  though explicit  was powerful; and it told a lot of both the characters.  I thought the end - when realization of who her lover was - well, her face was mechanical, then relaxed.  Not very good acting actually.  It was like the director told her to act sad, then smile, then try, and she just went through the facial rotation of taking a good family pic.  She just got over who her lover was too quickly, and she was not in the least bit credible.  She was false in every way, and that was my impression at the end of the film.  A sour note.  I will acknowledge she was on a tightrope act, but unfortunately, she fell.  Though I did not want her to.  I wanted her to keep being so good.  I wanted her to succeed, and be powerful.  But she was not.  She won an Oscar so I'm allowed to be critical.  And be disappointed.  It was a strong performance; she was the frontrunner, but personally, I was disappointed that Naomi Watts - who I thought simply phenomenal - was not even nominated for Mulholland Drive.  Naomi Wattss performance will be remembered; Halle Berry will just be remembered for winning the Oscar, but not necessarily for her performance.

All the performances were good.  Hank Grotowski/Billy Bob Thorton was wildly restrained and tormented as the prison guard.  He is so natural in his role.  Billy Bob Thorton is underrated as an actor; and he has flexibility, playing different kinds of roles.  I think because people expect him to be good, they are not particularly impressed when he delivers, as it seems he is just fulfilling expectations.  His character does not know what he wants, tolerating Leticia/Halle Berry, but not really moved, until he realizes she is a broken soul just like him.  His son, Sonny/Heath Ledger, is soft-hearted, which earns the enmity of his father, who loves him, but cannot express that love until his son's death.  P. Diddy is surprisingly touching as the condemned man.

It is a great film.  I was absorbed.  There were a lot of great performances.  And yes, Halle Berry was very good.  You sense her hurt, anger, and grief.  She was decent in a very complex, demanding role.  I don't mean to take away from her good work, but I don't think she deserved to get nominated.  Just my two cents.

That said, she and Billy Bob Thorton have phenomenal chemistry, and I wanted them to succeed.  In a weird way, this was a great love story.",1434412800,,3246,4.541522491349481

Didn't get to see it all so I ordered it.  Except for the much too explicit and raw sex scenes, especially the Big Couch Scene which went on way too long and was much too graphic, I really enjoyed the movie. At least now I have a good explanation of what gratuitous sex means - it means the movie would have been better without it. But, the movie is so well done otherwise and Thornton is such a splendid actor that his change in character and behavior is seamless.  He doesn't have to put it into words and the movie is better for that restraint.  You really have to be watching to catch all the things that make this a great story.  You can't take time to get a sandwich or go to the bathroom or you'll miss something important.  I'm going to watch it again with the commentaries.  Am looking forward to that.",1405814400,,986,4.130890052356021

1677552,5,B00005YU1M,"There is probably little I can say about this film that hasn't been said before.  It is a seamless work of art, blending so many elements--ingrained racism, the tension inherent in families, the sad results of bad parenting, the cruelty of society at large--that one is amazed to see it all fit in a single movie. Yet it gets these themes down effortlessly, thanks to fine writing, directing, and performances that shine through everywhere.  For anyone who doesn't know, ""Monster's Ball"" is about two very disparate parents who are plainly awful to their children. One is a corrections offiicer in a state penitentiary, living with his bigoted, rigid father, and the son he seems to resent without cause, who is following in his footsteps.  The other is a mother trying to raise a son whose father is on death row in the state pen, and due to be executed as the film begins. During the course of the movie, both parents lose their children, and a profound shift occurs in each of them.  Suddenly, these two people who never should have met, who never should have been destined to get along, recognize in each other a kindred spirit--and the result is so uplifting and beautiful.  I don't want to give the movie's best moments away; that would ruin it for future audiences.  But the changes in character, the absolutely wonderful cast, boosted by fine writing and direction and even a haunting, lovely score, are bound to capture imaginations everywhere.  Halle Berry gives the performance of a lifetime as Leticia Musgrove; Billy Bob Thornton is so subtle in his portrayal of Hank Grotowski that you want to applaud him for every scene in which he DOESN'T go over the top. And then there is Peter Boyle, the veteran, whose characterization of Buck, Hank's father, makes you forget he's acting. Finally, there is Heath Ledger, who is simply heartbreaking:  you see all the talent there, you know you are watching a future mega-star at work, and then you realize he's died, on the verge of so much greatness.  Ledger truly was a rare find. He was so young; yet in ""Brokeback Mountain"" he managed to believably age two decades. He had it all down:  the walk, the physical stance, the vocal changes....and his talent was surely on display in ""Monster's Ball"".  Already, he had star quality.  To see it snuffed out so pointlessly is killing. But enjoy him in this film; take a look and you are sure to come away uplifted.  There is no showboat scripting or acting here.  It is quietly affecting. But if you want to see a move that takes a genuine look at human nature--its ugliness and sadness and its redemption--this is the one to watch.",1405123200,4,2634,4.710239651416122

1677565,5,B00005YU1M,"This film takes a look at racism from the racist's point of view.  Don't worry, it still denounces such practices.  Billy Bob Thornton stars as Hank Grotowski, a deputy warden in a Georgia state prison (I think, the film jumps around a bit in regards to that fact.)  Grotowski lives with his son, played by Heath Ledger, also a prison guard, and his ailing father, played by Peter Boyle, a hardened racist whose son and grandson are steadily taking after him.  Their seemingly fine life gets turned on its side in the wake of the execution of a convicted murderer in which the two younger Grotowskis participate.  As the lives of the Grotowskis and the Musgroves, the family of the condemned black man, continue to spiral, unusual connections are made and people's thoughts on life are considered on both sides as they all struggle to cope with new emerging difficulties.  This film was startling in the issue it tackled and in the manner in which the actors behaved on screen.  I think everyone gave their best and more to make themselves come alive for their audience.  For once, I could not see Frank Barone when Peter Boyle spoke and, despite their sometimes extensive resumes, everyone else was also a fresh face for the duration of the film.  It's certainly not an easy movie to sit through, but I do feel it is worth it.  Enjoy.",1404086400,,1335,4.642553191489362

1677677,5,B00005YU1M,"I just watched this movie yesterday, and although I do feel it was a good movie, it is a tough look into the southern culture. Both Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thorton were very good in these roles, Billy Bob  portrayed a southern racist about as convincingly as one can and not totally make you hate him, before he does an about face and after his own loss moves him to a life change that transforms the film from a hate filled look into this small community to a person changed for the better as he ends up reversing his racist life.  As one viewer sait it is a ""gut wrenching, heart tugging performance that I have ever scene from Halle Berry."", which I agree with as I experience this element where I live in Mississippi and it is somewhat familiar. She is wonderful in this role, but her beauty and grace is somehow not exactly real, with these two beautiful people portraying people that in real life are so unlike the beautiful faces and bodies shown in this film.

1677806,5,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball is a pretty interesting drama.  Basically it's about Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry having their own separate sets of problems (some of which are major and life-changing) and eventually, they come together one magical evening.  The timing of the two coming together is fantastic and makes you think it was meant to happen.

So much storyline is devoted to building up family-related problems between the two characters WELL before the two of them actually meet.  It's wonderful when storytelling is precisely thought out and executed with such ease (thanks to Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry being top-notch actors and actresses of course).

On top of this, there's definitely a moral that you should accept people despite their skin color, and that issue is addressed in compelling, detailed and dramatic fashion (especially near the end involving a segment with Billy Bob's father and Halle Berry).  Let's just say, it's emotionally devastating, and given the nature of the father, not the least bit surprising.

Now what makes Monster's Ball actually enjoyable are the many emotional changes that occur along the way.  These moments contain an interesting set of circumstances that occasionally leads to a tragic outcome and most surprising is that the two scenes I'm thinking of are NOT related to racism.  Without spoiling what happens, both Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry's characters are forced to face unbelievable adversities.

Without spoiling another crucial element that makes the film click, the way everything ends up is surprising given what Billy Bob does for a living, and what he's responsible for.

I personally believe this is a golden example of drama done exactly the way it *should* be done.  Despite the slow pace and storyline development, you definitely don't want to walk out of the room and potentially miss a key moment of storytelling.  That's how a drama should be made.

Overall, solid acting, terrific storyline, wonderful characters, and a nice and relaxing country scenary elevates this movie to a perfect 5-star rating.",1326672000,,2078,5.182634730538922

1677810,5,B00005YU1M,"Polish American, Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), is the meanest SOB this side of the Vistula. He hates his prison guard job, his African-American neighbors, and his sensitive son (Heath Ledger), also a prison guard. Things come to a head when his son commits suicide after Hank berates him for botching his assignment of walking a death row inmate to the electric chair.

Hank quits his job and encounters a gorgeous, black woman, Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), who's having difficulties of her own. When her son is killed in a roadside accident, Hank and Leticia reach out to each other, both finding redemption in the unlikely pairing.

Monster's Ball (2001) was directed by Marc Forster and the Oscar-nominated script was written by Milo Addica and Will Rokos. Thornton and Berry are simply fantastic in their roles; Berry won an Oscar for her portrayal. Although her character is a bit rough around the edges, Halle Berry's beauty is simply breathtaking. The superb cast is rounded out by Peter Boyle, Mos Def, and Sean Combs. I was so mesmerized by the Asche & Spencer film score that I also purchased the film's soundtrack.

Monster's Ball is a spellbinding film and deserves every one of its five stars. Roger Ebert named it the best movie of 2001.",1277596800,,1261,4.883177570093458
1677811,4,B00005YU1M,"I didn't see this film when it came out in the theaters because it seemed, well, too monstrous.  Finally, this year, I picked it out of the bin at the local community college library, not knowing what to expect.

The first chunk of the film---maybe 40 minutes--was indeed monstrous!  I put my hands over my eyes during the execution scene.  I wonder why I even continued to watch it; apparently the performances of the principles had grabbed me enough to keep my attention.

It did get better, although not immediately.  The fact is that both of the main characters, played powerfully by Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton, are not very sympathetic.  In fact you could call them both child abusers.

Tragedies in both families soon bring both people to new depths and, in their pain, they manage to reach out to each other and find something like genuine love.  At least we hope that's what it is because  eventually we find ourselves rooting for them.

Thornton is wonderful as the brutal racist who finds that he can no longer make a living by watching executions and carrying on his family tradition of hatred.  A lesser actor might not make the transition believable but Thornton, apparently understating it at times, leads us along in his journey.  It's a performance that was as Oscar worthy as Berry's in my opinion; perhaps even more.

Berry is physically very beautiful which helps to relieve the bleakness of the story.  She was a smart choice for the role, although, as another reviewer noted, the fact that she is half-white may detract from her credibility here.  She is very good in the hysterical scenes; she lets out all stops.  I found her performance uneven though, particularly in the drunken scene when she flails her arms around aimlessly and in the final scene when one doesn't know if she's agreeing with Thornton that ""everything will be all right"" or if she's just lost her mind and can't do anything but eat that ice cream.

Heath Ledger is his usual amazing self.  He projects unimaginable pain in his brief appearance and it's almost a relief to see that his character won't have to suffer any longer.  The child who played Berry's son is also heart wrenching!

I would have given the film five stars except for two things.  The first is the excessively creepy way the execution scene was handled.  If the director was trying to make a statement, it was much better done in ""Dead Man Walking,"" in which the execution was wrenching beyond belief but also mitigated by the love of the nun who attended it.

The other is the way he handled the sex scenes.  The pathetic encounters with the town hooker were meant to show the lack of warmth in these men's lives, but again it didn't seem very believable.  The actress who played the part was far too beautiful to be the local whore in this run down town; gorgeous blond women who looked like that would have had much better options in life. It seemed exploitative on the part of the director.

As others have mentioned, the sex scenes between the two stars were controversial.  I found them curiously unmoving, certainly not loving or even erotic.  Then I realized that it was desperation that was being acted out and that seemed right.  Both characters, especially the woman, were coming from intense neediness, which justified her actions.  Still I wonder if that's how it would have played out in real life.  On a cynical note, I kept thinking that I hoped Berry was being paid well for her work.  I guess winning the Oscar made it worth it.

This isn't a film for everyone, as you can tell by the reviews.  I give it a high grade for its story and performances.",1273190400,3,3639,4.6328125
1677830,5,B00005YU1M,"There are two ways -- well, probably as many ways as watchers -- to view this film. First there are the time-honored conventions of epiphany through suffering and redemption through ""love"" or lust. That interpretation would take Billy Bob Thornton's sudden 'conversion' at face value, finding grounds for hope in the relationship he envisions with Halle Berry. I suspect that the logic of ""Hollywood"" demanded such an interpretation -- the closest that could be gotten to a happy ending. But a radically different point of view is more supportable, at least to me. Thornton's character is unredeemed and unredeemable. He's a 'control' monster, a narcissistic sociopath incapable of not hating. Clearly he did hate his son, and his father, so how will he strangely learn not to hate the woman whom he's effectively enslaved -- I use that word quite deliberately -- on the basis of her helplessness and his relentlessness? From that viewpoint, the film is a catastrophic tragedy. Pity that poor submissive woman! The horror in her eyes and the selfishness in his, in a moment you'll recognize when you see it, make all the stars of the Georgia night twinkle in bitter irony.

This is centrally a film about racism. I can tell you that much without 'spoiling' the plot, can't I? The depiction of racism is excruciating... and realistic. There are such people, even today. Racism is America's great failure, the hateful core of a society that has always claimed ""God's favor"". ""Monster's Ball"" is also above the corrosive immorality of ""Capital Punishment"". If the film is unambiguous about anything, it's the wrongness of Capital Punishment, although that theme goes 'underground, after the first twenty minutes. Capital Punishment isn't 'wrong' because the wrong person might be slain. It's wrong because of what it does to the society that arrogantly presumes the right to kill. Thornton's father is a monster because of his presumption of having the right stuff, of not being weak like his dead wife was, of knowing who needs killing in his world. Thornton may reject that father, out of his own hunger for 'love', but he trusts in the same self-righteousness. His son, the third-generation correctional officer, can't survive in such a world of righteousness. The most human character in the film, he is inevitably the victim of Capital Punishment, murdered by his own reluctance to murder. Capital Punishment is statist murder, inseparable from all the vices of racism and a violent society. [But don't yelp at me, dear readers! I'm just explicating the film. I'd push the button on a really vile criminal -- Ollie North, for instance -- without hesitation.]

Most of the one-star reviews of this already old film express outrage that Halle Berry won an Oscar for her performance in it. Me, I think she deserved it. The woman she portrays is so skittish, so defenseless, that her 'captivity' to the will of the Thornton character becomes plausible. A less vulnerable character would not have been such a plausible prey. Billy Bob Thornton is impressive also, portraying the repressed executioner. His transformation, to my mind, is plausible only if you recognize the ruthless selfishness it seems to conceal.",1272240000,4,3211,5.0680529300567105

1677832,5,B00005YU1M,"This movie was not a big favorite with audiences so I knew there had to be something meaningful in it that the shallow public could not see or was not able to see or perhaps refused to see.
It has one of the loveliest soundtracks I've ever heard which clings to the soul with a lingering and misty melancoly.
A movie for for those who have known suffering.
The Monster's Ball is a very bleak film yet it's also quite rare in that it's truly unpredictable.
You won't find Hollywood trappings here. This is an Indy film, thoughtful with symbolism and a profound message. This movie caused a knee jerk reaction in parts of the black community, causing calls for boycotting and some racial tension.
Simply put, a white racist death row prison guard, through a set of tragic and complex circumstances, begins to fall in love with the black wife of an inmate that he recently executed, of which she is totally unaware. Their anguished bond is the fact that they both have lost young sons.
There is some blunt sexual content, however it's mainly queasy and uncomfortably painful rather than erotic. Still, this motion picture is not intended for children.
This movie somehow captures the mood of yearning reconcillation between two devastated souls
who discover they have absolutely nowhere else left to turn, except to each other.
This is a startling ""feel bad"" movie that is able to say: tragedy will not be permitted to become the end of all hope. Rather it states: When you're at the end of your rope, letting go can be the best thing you can do.
Ultimately consoling in a way that seeks to unlock a warm, rainy night in your heart where abandoned innocence is finally given a chance to be regained.
Atmospheric and  moody with a poetic and mystical resolution that leaves you with a mesmerizing shimmer of hope.

1677833,3,B00005YU1M,"We all know that I love depressing, and I love dark depictions of human suffering.  I love to have my emotional core tapped, drained even, but harsh realities of humanity in its rawest form.  This very year (2001, the year in question) was dominated in my eyes by the very bleak and very raw `In the Bedroom', a film that tapped into the most brutal depictions of grief and loss and vengeance I've ever seen on film.  It may be concluded that, since I am so incredibly head-over-heals in love with `In the Bedroom' that my sentiments would be mirrored for the equally bleak and maybe ever more gritty depiction of depression `Monster's Ball'.

The issue I have with this film is that it is uneven and forced.

Don't get me wrong; there are many facets of this film that work brilliantly.  For the most part the acting is very strong and the script, while definitely brutal (almost to a fault) is written with a layer of depth that makes the overwhelming feel forgivable.  My complaint here is that the film could have been something truly remarkable if it had found its footing without resorting to complete and total devastation.  I like my depressing, but there comes a point within a film where you sink so low that you cannot fathom a resolution.

The thing is, `Monster's Ball' isn't the kind of film that requires that absolute lowness.

The film revolves around the unlikely romance between a prison guard named Hank and a single mother named Leticia.  Hank is a white borderline racist (he's more conditioned that way by an oppressive father than truly headstrong in that conviction) who happens to have a part in the execution of Leticia's husband, Lawrence.  Leticia has a lot of things wrong with her life.  She is struggling financially to take care of an overweight child she views as a burden, until he is hit by a car and killed and she realizes how empty she is on her own.  She strikes up a drunken fling with Hank that leads to a mutual bonding over the loss of family (Hank's tormented son Sonny recently took his own life) that is tested by the truths behind Hanks' involvement in Lawrence's execution, not to mention Hank's father's outlandish racism.

The film is shot in a very grainy almost yellow overtone (an aspect of the film I absolutely adore) that gives you an instant sense of misery and emptiness.  The performances by the cast elevate this mood.  Heath Ledger deserves `best in show' mentions for his BRILLIANT supporting performance (cameo if you will) as Sonny.  He evokes such pure emotional response to the situation, the line of work weighing in on his conscience and the emotional weight of his background and apparent emptiness crushing down on him.  Billy Bob Thornton takes that same emotional deterioration and muddies it a bit to elongate the performance.  He is essentially the same character, but Sonny's fatal explosion really makes his performance pop.  Thornton is just as marvelous (in my opinion) just in a different way.

I thought the Peter Boyle was serviceable in a caricature that really only simplified the films promise and took it down a notch.

This brings me to Halle Berry (OSCAR winner Halle Berry).  I admit, when she won I cheered.  It was such a milestone and her acceptance speech was SO heartfelt and beautiful and just mesmerizing.  Even if I felt that a few of her fellow nominees were more deserving (Kidman, Zellweger, Spacek) her win made me very happy.  That said, her performance is quite uneven and actually sets the tone for the film itself being uneven.  She manages to nail quite a few scenes, but she comes off desperate in some, unsure in others, and this takes away from the character.  Her quieter scenes tend to work better than her loud ones, but even in those she has moments where she almost seems forcibly subtle, as if she has been studying over actress's quiet depictions of grief and trying to emulate.  In her louder moments she comes across manic and desperate and overreaching for attention.  Sometimes it works (that drunk scene, regardless of what some say, was flawless) and other times it just doesn't (the scene where she attacks her kid seemed overreaching for me).  I love her and am happy for her and for her `moment', but in all honesty one cannot consider this a fully realized and deserving performance.

The films grittiness is almost to a fault in that it layers on the darkness without backing it up with a real sense of inner depth.  Where it tries to make a statement on the legal systems death penalty, it misses the mark that the masterful `Dead Man Walking' hit.  Where it attempts to connect with the effects of instilled racism, it misses the mark that films like `American History X' really connected to.  Where it makes strides towards the grief and guilt ridden depiction of a parent outliving a child, it misses the mark that `In the Bedroom' completely nailed.

It has a lot of avenues it tries to cover but it lacks the finesse to cover each one thoroughly.  It is a worthy viewing, but it doesn't reach the perfection that it could have found with a tighter script and a little more tailoring of Berry's performance.

That said; the final scene on the front porch stairs with Hank and Leticia is the perfect way to end and still haunts me today.",1258675200,2,5268,4.672451193058568

For instance, Halle Berry, I feel despite winning the Oscar for her performance here, was miscast--she seems too beautiful and glamorous to convince me that she's an impoverished Southern black woman.  Also the film seems to be under-written, I would've like to have more information about the relationship between her and the convict husband (Sean Combs, this film seemed to me to be more about Billy Bob's character than about her. Also the ending left me unresolved like that's it!?  No sudden explosion from her when she realizes the secret that Billy Bob has been carrying with him all this time. But there is some fine acting in this film not only from the leads but also from its supporting players like Sean Combs, the late Peter Boyle and Heath Ledger, who in one final scene with Billy Bob, showed us how talented he really was.

With the guilt of that, and Halle's son dying, they both created a comfort space for each other. They talked, related a bit and had sex (it was Halle's idea).

So she had to take her clothes off to get an Oscar?  Backwards!!  If you want to be taken seriously, Halle, as a black actress, keep your clothes on!  Hello, use your brain sometimes and not your body.

I don't think Ms. Halle ever really recovered from the divorces.  She is a smart woman, but she's got some screws loose.  Especially because Eric Benet told her to take the role, saying ""take risks""!  What husband that loves and values his wife would tell her to take a role like that?  Come on.  She has no self-esteem, self-worth, or self-respect.  I hope she is ashamed of herself.

So all in all the film itself was ""blah"".  It could have been MUCH better if they focus was more on the plot than them two getting it on.

The cinematographer, Robert Schaefer, did a terrific job with this.

I found it to be one of those rare movies that deals with racism that doesn't come on too heavy-handed with all the political correctness nonsense. It handled the problem intelligently, I thought.

None of the characters are particularly likable but I thought Billy Bob Thornton's ""Hank Grotowski"" was so interesting a character that I didn't care whether I liked him or not.

1677898,4,B00005YU1M,"I saw ""Monster's Ball"" in the movie theatre. I felt then that it was a good movie, but the key reason I even went to see it in theatres is because Halle Berry, one of my all-time favorite actresses, was starring in it.  I have seen most of Halle's movies, and I can attest to the fact that this is, acting-wise, her best film. Halle is an outstanding actress, but I have never really seen her give her all, until now.  Halle really went all out for this movie, and she deserved the Oscar.  Although I don't think it's fair that so many African-American actresses before Halle have done phenomenal jobs in movies and never received an Oscar, but Halle shined in this film and that Oscar had her name on it as far as I'm concerned.  The ranting and raving about Halle had to be foremost, however, the entire cast did a great job.  Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger, Mos Def, and Diddy all showed their acting abilities, and I was impressed.

This was not an easy film to watch.  It didn't have a Hollywood ending or cheesy subject matter.  The film shows us three generations of corrections officers, a grandfather, a father, and a son.  The father and grandfather both have prejudiced mindsets, however the son doesn't.  We learn that the father  (Hank) doesn't love his son, and his son does an unlikely thing to show how upset he is about that, commits suicide in front of his father.

We meet Leticia and her son Tyrell.  Leticia's husband is given the death penalty, and she's naturally on-edge.  She attempts to relax her nerves by smoking, drinking and lashing out at her obese progeny.  As the movie progresses, Tyrell is tragically killed in a hit and run.  From what the movie implies, all Leticia had was her son.  She was never seen with parents or friends.  After her husband and son die, she's all alone in life, until she meets Hank.  Hank sees Leticia and her dying son on the side of the road and decide to stop and offer aid to them.  He rushes them to the hospital, and from there, the two of them build a friendship, and then a relationship.

Hank and Leticia both feel vulnerable because of the unfortunate occurrences they both lived.  Their relationship, from the outside looking in, resembles two people who are yearning for a happiness they'd seemingly never come across and hoped to find in one another.

The irony of Hank and Leticia's relationship is that Hank was one of the correction's officers who helped kill Leticia's husband, but she is oblivious to this.

This motion picture will totally lure you into it's painful plot.  Other reviews that I've read on this movie said that it was boring, and perhaps to some, it is; but if you give this movie your undivided attention from start to finish, there is hardly a boring moment in my opinion.

I DO NOT recommend this picture for the faint of heart.  It includes some of the most graphic scenes cinema has ever seen, and some of them are not easy to stomach.  Also, that oh so popular sex scene...very candid and graphic. However, if you can handle it, by all means take a look at this heart-wrenching film.",1182816000,2,3087,4.533453887884268
1677899,2,B00005YU1M,"This is one of the most over-rated movies I've ever seen.  It is too contrived in plot and too manipulative, particularly with respect to the sex scene between Thornton and Berry.  Consider the following:

Billy Bob Thornton plays a racist prison guard who takes a sort of military pride in the structured electrocution of condemned prisoners.  His son, a non-racist guard under him, is not up to the same standard.  A condemned prisoner, the husband of the woman played by Halle Berry, is put to death.

Through a convoluted set of circimstances, Thornton takes up with Ms. Berry, after Thornton's son commits suicide and Berry's overweight son is killed in a car accident.  Neither knows of their connection to the electrocuted prisoner until the end of the movie.  The device used to reveal the connection should be obvious to any viewer  Are you following this?

For some reason (perhaps the fact that Halle Berry is drop dead gorgeous) Thornton gives up his racism and has an extremely steamy sex scene with the beauteous widow.  Well, that's understandable, but the fact that she is magnificent to look upon is grossly manipulative.  Would Thornton have been so solicitous of her if she had been an average looking African American woman?  I doubt it. Beauty trumps racism.

Several movies have been made, through the years, about a racist white becoming liberalized by association with an African American, and in virtually every case the device for attaining this has been so contrived as to make a viewer groan.  In one case a blind white girl falls in love with a very nice black man.  In another case, a racist white is chained to a black man and they have to cooperate to escape pursuers.  In yet another, a white girl brings a black man home to meet her upper class parents--but the black man is a handsome Ivy League surgeon.  Sidney Poitier, a fine actor, was in all of these.

In all of these, including Monster's Ball, the devices are just too heavy handed and obvious.  The acting in Monster's Ball is OK, but the story is the problem.  For example, I never believed for a second that the Halle Berry character would have said, ""Make me feel good"" and seduced Thornton.  Why?  I don't object to sexy scenes, per se.  I object when sex scenes are included to titilate the viewer, and that was exactly the case in Monster's Ball.",1181692800,6,2345,4.705159705159705

The characters are difficult to warm up to which may have been the writer and director's point.  We get plenty of love stories that lead us down the primerose path.  What about a love story about two people who never should have been associated with each other.  Two people whose stars not only didn't cross, they were magnetically repelled from ever even nearing each other.  This is what ""Monster's Ball"" is to me.  In that sense, it is an interesting movie.

The characters are rather extreme but, then, that's in keeping with the extreme nature of the message.  Still, it's hard not to be put off a bit because of how disfuctional the main characters are.  By the mid-point of the movie, we know who we DON'T like and the rest of the movie tries to salvage two out of those three.  This change of direction would seem impossible except for the introduction of exteme crises that alter the lives of the people we are reluctant to care about.  We reach the end of the movie shaking our heads but relizing that, in some perverse way, there's someone for everyone.  I'm reminded of the Rolling Stones's song with the lyrics ""You can't always get what you want but if you try sometime, you just might find, you get what you need.""  Not inspiring but a reminder that even scoundrels need someone to hold onto from time to time.  I found that the premise worked well enough for me.",1164758400,5,1502,4.514814814814815

You have one young man who self-medicates with a candy stash; there's another who chooses to end his pain by suicide. And anyone on these boards who hasn't turned to something--a higher power, alcohol, spending money, running, sex, Ben and Jerry's, the whole gamut of wholesome/not so wholesome activities--to make themselves ""feel good"" is a liar.

The story line is interesting.  A woman becomes involved with a guard who was at her husband's execution.  But the reason behind the realtionship is one of desparation.

For this to work, you need to have actors that this is reasonable.  But Hallie Berry is just too beautiful and they have done nothing to make her look any less beautiful.  As presented, she would have no problem attracting a variety of desirable men.  There are a number of actress who would be physically better suited or they could have just made Hallie look plain but no, they had to not only go with the flavour of the year and make her look glamourous too boot.

Additionally, they give her a child that would never be hers and her husbands.  But was choosen again to further the storyline.

This is an interesting story that was ruined by casting for dollars.  While beautiful actresses have played plain characters (see Ann Margaret in Return of the Soldier) but they toned down their looks to be more realistic.  This was not done for this movie.

I'm in complete disagreement with comments that remark the film shows 'a black woman is sexually servicing a white man' - it's obvious the comments were written by someone who hasn't seen the movie and is just aware of the contoversial scene. Halle Berry doesn't play a prosititute in the film and Thornton is not her john, there is no money exchanged and no 'servicing' going on here. In fact, if the reviewer had watched the entire movie they would have found it quite clear that, if anything, Thornton's character was 'servicing' Berry's character.  But when two lovers have sex, I've never found it common to describe either person has servicing the other.  In addition, describing a film as 'racist' when it clearly and intentionally portrays at least two characters as racists is just a poorly framed comment written by someone with a chip on their shoulder.  Berry did not get an Oscar for the sex scenes in the film, she won in spite of them.

Also the New Yorker's comments about ""the plotting is sheer Hollywood in its schemes and coincidences"" are misleading.

And there is no coincidence, whatsoever, to the fact that black women were forced to sexually service white men during slavery?  This is an awfully BIG coincidence that a black woman finally gets an Oscar for a role where is is a subordinate to a white man in a superior position -- just like the good ole days of slavery?  And I guess black people are expected to be too DUMB to figure out that this movie and the Oscar award was a DISRESPECTFUL SLAP to black women?  Come on now -- I know that black people are not too dumb to see this for what it really is.  True, there are some black people who will use one brain cell to say, ""Well, she's pretty, so I guess I will overlook all of the racism that happened with this Award.""  But not all of us are so STUPID and submissive of racism.  This is one movie that needs to be banned for being politically incorrect and disrespectful to blacks, just as Birth of a Nation and Song of the South were once banned -- please put the one at the top of the ban list.  And by the way, boycott Halle Berry for her participation as ""ho"" to Lions Gate being the ""pimp"" to the Oscars ""john"" because Lions Gate DUMPED N'Bushe Wright and Angela Bassett because they were too dark and refused to do the nude sex scenes.  Also someone tell me why the Oscars gave the first and only award to a black woman for a PORN role???  If you reverse the race roles in Monster' Ball and made the lead character a WHITE woman and the lead actor a BLACK man, those actors would have been blackballed, blacklisted and probably lynched.  But because of the legacy of slavery, I guess it is okay for the white man to have the black women, but not the other way around.  When the Oscars give an award to a movie with a white woman in a similar sex role with a black man like Monster's Ball -- then I will lift my boycott to Halle Berry.  But until then, I plan to protest and boycott this film and Halle Berry and will not support any of her future films as well.",1142812800,14,2330,4.197309417040358
1677930,5,B00005YU1M,"Thats how you feel when you watch this powerful film about a black woman (Berry) who loses everything, her husband, her son...just to find love in the eyes of a stranger.  Not just any stranger...but a racist white man who helped execute her husband.  Leticia (Berry) is struggling to keep her family alive, with no help from her inmate husband on death row.  She works a dead end job to feed her obese son and in her eyes, it all seems pointless...like her life is going nowhere.  When her husband is executed and a freak accident causes her the loss of her son she's thrown into an almost unwilling relationship with Hank (Thorton) a racist warden at the prison her husband was killed in.  Their relationship is strange to each other, and they want it almost as much as they're afraid of it, and it's the fear that I feel makes them want it even more.  This film has strong performances with an even stronger life lesson tagged on.  Sometimes we think we know ourselves, but with the snap of your fingers your can find that you never knew yourself at all.  I was so happy to see Halle take home the oscar and I hope to see her tackle more roles that challenge her and prove that this was not a fluke.  Look for strong performances by Heath Ledger (this is the film that persuaded Ang Lee to cast Heath in Brokeback Mountain) as well as Peter Boil who is so evil you loathe him long after the credits are done rolling.  This film touches upon raw human emotion coupled with real issues we still face today.  Brilliantly acted and scripted and well worth all the praise.",1141689600,5,1570,4.416666666666667
1677931,2,B00005YU1M,"This movie is totally overrated to me. Not worth watching more than once. Not even Oscar worthy. The only reason why this movie was a big deal and the reason why Halle Barry won an Oscar is because of the explicit sex scene between Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton.

I have to say I am really dissapointed in Halle Berry for doing that unnecessary sex scene. They did not have to go that far to get the point across. I haven't respected her the same since. Most women starting out in their acting careers do scenes like that to get ahead. Halle Berry was already well established and respected. She didn't need to do that kind of a scene.

Besides that one scene, the reason I didn't really care for this movie is because I felt that the characters were not well established. I did not feel a connection with them. Also I thought Halle Berry's acting was not that great or believable. I felt she overacted. There were only two characters in the movie that interested me and that was the husband on death row played by Sean Combs and the neighbor with the boys played by Mos Def. They were interesting enough to me where I wanted to know more about their characters.",1138147200,11,1167,4.398148148148148

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!

1677950,5,B00005YU1M,"Since Halle Berry was awarded numerous awards for this movie, and given so much praise, I decided to rent ""Monster's Ball"" just to see what the fuss was all about. After watching it, I was in awe, and feel that this movie should have been commended more than it was.

The story starts off with Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), a corrections officer who lives with his father, a retired officer (who is also a racist) and his son, Sonny (who is an officer only to make his father proud of him). Hank is also a racist because he follows in his father's footsteps. Hank hates his son because he feels like Sonny is too weak like his mother. However, tragedy strikes which make Hank think about his values in life, and what is really important. One day he meets Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), an African-American woman who is lying on the road with her unconscious son, screaming for help. He takes them to the hospital, and forms a connection with her. The story continues with Leticia and Hank's relationship.

Marc Forster (who also directed Finding Neverland) did flawless job in directing this movie. Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger and Peter Boyle acted well for their roles. But I feel the main credit goes to Halle Berry. I think she did incredibly well for her role as Leticia. Although there is a lot of debate as to whether she should have won the Academy Award or not, I personally feel that she deserved the award for her role in this film. To boldly play a role on a controversial story in one thing, but to act it well is another thing, and I think Halle Berry did very well in that aspect.

Furthermore, the chemistry between Hank and Leticia is portrayed nicely in the movie, where we get to see two people, who are suffering emotionally for all the mistakes that they made, and find some kind of solace when they meet one another, which eventually turns into love. Another aspect of the movie that impressed me was the background score. The dark, haunting music really went well with the scenes, and I applaud Asche and Spencer for their work.

All in all, I would definitely watch ""Monster's Ball"" again because it is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.",1134172800,11,2194,4.532828282828283
1677951,5,B00005YU1M,"This story really got to me. It made me see that when you come right down to it, no matter what your race, creed or color, we all have the capacity to want to be loved and to give love.

Here you have two people. The man is somewhat a bigot from a very bigotted family, he is in law enforcement and he has learned over the years to shut himself off from the world. You have the woman, a black woman. Her life has been a struggle from the time she was concieved in the womb. Her husband dies on death row (unknown to her is that the man was his prison guard), she drinks too much, tries to do good by her son but fails and he too dies.

These two come together in their loss. Sharing themselves with each other, they are unable to not need and want each other.

This movie was fantastic! Halle Berry did the performance of her life. She shows the pain and struggle of every pretty but poor young black woman in this country. Billy Bob Thornton made us hate him and then care for him despite all his shortcomings. Also Peter Boyle was one of the ugliest representations of white racism I've seen in a long time. Boyle's racist wasn't any tobacco chewing, moonshine swilling, Klansmen. He was worse. He was a sickly, old granddaddy who raised a family and made a career out of guarding people whose skin color he hated. This is the face of white racism in America nowadays, not hooded Klansmen and blackbooted Nazis.

Heath Ledger is a doll baby and is making a great career for himself (""Ned Kelly""/""Four Feathers"") in this movie he plays Billy Bob Thornton's negelected, emotionally battered only son. His life was tragic and so much a shame.",1131408000,7,1641,4.352941176470588

Contrary to the popular myth going around black male moviegoer circles, there are WAAAY more films showing interracial romance/sex between black men and white women? (Save The Last Dance, O, The End Of Violence, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?, Hustle And Flow, Love Field, etc.) And, on the rare occasion,

when we do get to see vice versa we got to hear and read angry, spiteful comments. PLEASE!

This isn't even a movie about interracial sex or relationships. It's about two people in a small Southern town in pain, gravitating towards each other because, depite all their differences, nobody else is there for them. Both ease the emotional burdens of the other one in ways no other black man or white woman can. Because down deep inside the color of their skins is less important than the tragic loss of child. That bonds them closer than race or nationality.

The sex scene was not intended to be erotic or arousing. If people see it that way, it is a shame. The sex these two have is really a yearning for life. They are both psycholigically and emotionally damaged. This wasn't any get yer freak on late at night on the sly interracial encounter.

1677953,1,B00005YU1M,"This is pure simplistic preachy garbage along similar lines as Disney's 'Remember the Titans'.  Just a little more edgy but still the same cotton candy 'rascism is bad' message done up all super sugary for your consumption.

First things first, Halle Berry really reveals the blatant charade she was playing about not wanting to do nudity when negotiating 2 million dollars to briefly flash her breasts in Swordfish.  She shows as much as she can without it becoming a porn film in Monster's ball in a very explicit sex scene with Billy Bob Thorton and all with no reservations or shyness whatsoever.

Great suspension of belief is required as Leticia unknowingly falls in love to the man who executed her husband for whatever crime he was convicted of.

Of course, Billy Bob comes with the baggage of racial prejudiced culture and family.  And typical fashion for these types of movies, they are brought together by circumstances and learn not only to tolerate but to truly care for each other.

It all comes so easy for the gorgeous Halle Berry and the hideous Billy Bob.  One minute Billy Bob is harassing black neighbor kids because they are black.  The next he is in love with a black woman.

And as easy as the prejudices disintegrate, the prejudices reimerge and cause problems.  This is the most insulting aspect of this movie.

Leticia and BBT (whatever his character name was) are now in love and Leticia comes to visit ole BBT.  There she comes across his father played by Peter Boyle who says some rascist things.  Well, the character of Leticia is presented as a truely shallow person and simpleton.  She runs off hating the BBT character and this is a HUGE obstacle in their relationship being unable to trust BBT as not being a rascist as well.

Apparently, the writers see fit to have the Leticia character be such an unreasonable dullard that she transfers any rascist sentiments by anyone to apply also to how BBT feels about her.

Just as if a butterfly has rascist thoughts in a corn field in Illinois, it can cause a chain reaction and become genocide in Indonesia.  So it is that Leticia and BBT break up due to the rascist perspective of BBT's father.  It's all so hard to overcome because Leticia won't talk to BBT anymore to know he isn't a rascist also.

The movie is another simplistic feel good story designed for extra-segregated types who like to proclaim ""I have (Black/White) friends and I consider them my equals.""

Despite being complete garbage otherwise, I did have a fondness for a certain scene.  BBT brings his rascist dad Peter Boyle to the old people's home.  During the interview, the representative states ""You must really love your father"".  BBT's reply, ""Not really"".

It is simplistic garbage like this movie that shows there still is a long way to go in regards to examining racial tensions.",1128211200,10,2838,4.742857142857143
1677954,1,B00005YU1M,"This is such a revolting movie that requires a certain mental and emotional degeneracy to create in its totality. But, I guess the real concern should be that of Halle Berry and Puff Daddy. One has to stop and wonder what manner of emotional and mental inadequacy besets these two individuals that they, with all their financial progress and public standing, could stoop so low to actually act those roles and so blatantly contribute towards publicly assasinating the so called ""Black"" Male ( the inverted commas """" are used because in truth my skin color and my hair color are two different colors and thus it is a senseless base for reference of a human race?). The question is, could these individuals not have requested that the script be void of undertones? And if refused could they not have stood up for something in their lives and walked away from the roles? There are numerous questions unaswered/unasked, but I shall leave that to individuals to bewilder about.

Back to the the two individuals in question here, Without being rude, It seems intelligence is not their strongest virtues.

Furthermore, I wonder if those who ""review"" this movie either lack, intentionally / unintentionally the capacity to see beyond their own prejudices and have thus, self-blind folded themselves to the ""undertones"" towards the ""black"" male in this movie? Even the verbal content is derogatory and filled with cliche's of the ""black"" male. Something reviewers here (for some reason best known to them) tend to pretend is not evident in the movie. Ironically, this movie and its questionable content was Something brought to my attention by a few people from even Asian, european and Afro-Caribean/African origin during light conversations when this movie was mentioned. Yet these ""reviewers"" whitewash this obvious fact and somehow shower praise....beats me!!

Anyway, I do not need to defend the race gender that I am a part of, but there are numerous 'brothers' out there who exists that do not conform to todays stereotype low-level intelligent, gun totting  retard hoodlum desperate to become an entertainer of any sort that the media trys so relentlessy to port as ""role"" models for ""blacks"".

Just as there are a few 'sisters' out there who are not plagued with emotional and mental inadequacies that drive them to vainlessly try to become semi-quasi straight (fake)haired defuncts of society that daily aligns our television viewing and walks our streets.

Sadly, maybe these retard actors, singers and sports personnel could take a few lessons from the behaviour of people like Mr Wesley Snipes, Mr Lennox Lewis and Mr Rocky Johnson maybe they will learn from these peoples behaviour (in the toughest/racist of times) that you do not need to bend all the way backwards in your quest for public attention, especially when you have reached a certain level within that artificial world of self-inadequacies.",1127520000,8,2907,5.083857442348008

Billy Bob and Halle Berry are both astounding. I heard people say she didn't deserve the Oscar so I really wanted to see the movie. Don't believe a word of that! She is simply great, very different from all her other roles. She has a special vulnerability and sadness in her eyes that would touch the coldest of hearts. And the crying scenes are extrmeely intense. OK, so the sex scenes were a bit long given the circumstances, but I totally cope with the idea of removing pain with anti-pain, which is pleasure. Actually there's a book (I honestly don't remember the title) where the main character says ""I need to have sex or I'll start  cuttin' myself, to take the pain off my mind"". And Halle Berry's line reminded me of that phrase. So just watch the movie and leave politics behind.",1126915200,4,961,4.522988505747127
1677956,1,B00005YU1M,"You know, this film insults the intelligence of the public. Why would a young beautiful woman go for an old miserable man? She has just lost her husband, and her fat child will soon die in the film as well.

Possibility #1: Race and socioeconomic status - I know, maybe it was because Halle Berry's character decided she was ""movin' on up"" and needed to get an established old white male from the community. That might be a deleted scene from the film.

Possibility #2: She is a highly overexposed sexy actor in a 2002 film, and the nation wants to see her naked with another famous hollywood actor. Now most people will lie that healing racial tensions and overcoming prejudice are key issues in the story. I beg to differ with this idea of ""healing"".

Taking what another reviewer said, if this were a black racist cop with a white female woman this film would have flopped...unless... you find a famous black actor and white woman. Let's say that Samuel L. Jackson is the black racist cop and Jessica Simpson is the widow. Do you think the audience would believe he truly regrets his racist ideologies? Not So. Most would understand he just wants sex from a beautiful and much younger woman. That is what this film is: a Hollywood sex show. If this film were all that great, you could change the cast members to be any person you would like and it wouldn't flaw the film. The problem is, without Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry, the film is about a racist white cop who gets easy sexy from a dumb black mindless widow who recovers from the loss of her husband (and her son) easily. Rate this whatever you want, but I see it as nothing more than a waste of time. Focus on something that affects your life, such as politics.

If this film had of been about a white female sleeping with a black racist cop who was her dead husband's executioner, this miserable film would not at all have been a hit. Since Hollywood can only think of racism from the white aspect, they chose to show this racist cop's hatred unravel through his love affair with a desperate black female. Sex scenes litter the film and sodomy does as well. Not that adults can't handle this, but I guess they wanted to make it extremely physical so that we could see just how much fun Hank has when he gets to toy around with the widow. My point is this. Both Berry and Thorton are way too good for a miserable film like this, and the award they gave her seems more a sarcastic insult then a reward for acting skill. Sure, make this out to be such an exciting movie when this happened so much in our nations past history. How many slaves were killed for trying to escape, and then their wives used as sexual action figures by the slave owner? I can't bear to watch this trash again. I guess the message is simple: Just because you are racist against a certain race doesn't mean you will turn down good sex when you can get it. Oh and Bulwinkle is a better show than this piece of putrid trash, I could take 5 minutes of Bulwinkle worthy of an award more than this tasteless movie.",1122681600,12,1484,4.2105263157894735

My suggestion:  Next time, try reading the liner notes on the dvd cover instead of just the title.  That way, your chances of ending up with something that would be suitable for broadcast on ""Nick at Night"" will be a lot better.

Believe me, this technique really works.  If nothing else, ""The adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" or better yet ""The Cat in the Hat"" may be your next best bets.  That is, if you don't want to be banished to the ""Dog House"" by your wife for weeks to come.

We, the viewers, cannot get past that she is Halle, and her acting is not as profound to convince us otherwise.  Sorry.

Billy Bob, however is excellent in which ever role he stars in.  He is gifted, although he deserves roles that can truly bring out his ability to depict memorable characters; this role was simple.

Don't even ask WHY she won an academy award.  Was it for that overexaggerated nude sex scene where she practically rapes Billy Bob???  Or maybe it was her OTHER scene where she attacks her obese son.

Billy Bob Thornton plays Hank, a supervisor on death row at the local pen.  Sean Combs (aka P. Diddy) plays Lawrence Musgrove, an admitted ""bad man"" on that death row. Hank has a son, played by Heath Ledger, who also works at the prison, and Hank's father, played by Peter Boyle, retired from the same place.  Dad is now old and decrepit, and is a poisonous racist. Lawrence's wife, Leticia, is trying to make ends meet as a waitress while supporting their son, Tyrell.

The first act ends with Lawrence's execution, and we see in that scene that Hank is deadly serious about professionalism on death row.

Hank goes often to the diner where Leticia works, and they gradually strike up a casual relationship.

Without giving away spoilers, disasters happen in both of their families, and they are drawn to one another in their respective grief.  This causes no small amount of conflict.  Leticia is black.  Hank's father is an extreme racist.  Hank doesn't know that Leticia is P. Diddy's widow.  Leticia doesn't know that Hank supervised her husband's execution.

It's inevitable that Leticia discovers that Hank was involved in the execution.  In a different movie that might have led to a final act full of histrionics and ending in some hokey reconcilement.  In ""Monster's Ball"" this discovery is realistic and low-key.  For several moments there is no dialogue, and the scene ends with shared ice cream rather than screaming.

Hank and Leticia both begin this movie with emotional baggage, and during the course of the movie, more baggage is added to both of them.  Yet at the end I felt justified hoping that things were headed in the right direction for both of them.

I see several reviews for ""Monster's Ball"" complaining about how boring and bad it is.  Several of these enlightened reviewers go on to say that Halle Berry's nudity is the only reason to watch it at all.  Curious that I can't find many negative reviews without misspelled words.  On the first page alone I see the following ""difficult"" words misspelled or improperly used: ""write"", ""roll"", ""would"", ""makes"".

My point is that I see ""criticism"" divided pretty evenly - those who have difficulty expressing themselves in written English don't like the movie, while those without said difficulty do.  So - the question for you, the potential viewer, is ""do you think?""",1117584000,8,2483,4.873508353221957

Her agenda is loud and clear and that's what detracts from her acting.  There are real, solid actresses out there, I really believe there are - of all ethnicities, who are also very attractive.  She just isn't one of those solid actresses; she's been overrated due to JUST her outward appearance, which is common for Hollywood to push on the movie-going public.

PS the person that wrote the fat kid is the star - he's right on!  His story and his acting are easily overlooked, poor fellow.",1109894400,8,1101,4.475
1677974,2,B00005YU1M,"I luv halle berry, infact, she's one of my favourite actors. In this film her character is more than convincing. However, I just think the film drags and hasn't got a real climax or that 'something' in a film that makes you have some kinda deep reaction that lasts for about 3 scenes. the deathrow scene and the sex scene are reaction-jerkers, but that reaction only lasts for a little while cos of the bland scenes to follow. I can't even be bothered to wrtite this review...infact, i'm boring myself so i'm gonna wrap it up. This film was borrrring..snorrrrrrrr!

1677975,4,B00005YU1M,"Here is a movie that uses the plight of a condemned man as a point-of-departure to launch everything else in the storyline.  This is a bit unusual, at least to my knowledge.  Usually in Death-Row films there is some sort of recapitulation of the crime that the felon committed.  Not so here.  We're never told exactly what he did, although we're probably safe in assuming he did something more egregious than double-parking.

The film takes a stab at sundry unpleasant aspects of the human condition.  We vicariously experience circumstances such as being an inmate on death row, being a corrections officer in charge of a death row inmate, being the wife of a death row inmate, losing a son, loss of employment & one's house,  growing old & feeling decrepit as well as a tinge of the horror of prejudice / racism.  In short, if you're looking for a cheery movie you may want to look elsewhere.

The movie is very well done and Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton turn in remarkable performances.  The tone of the film is very surreal and subtle, and the soft guitar soundtrack is a nice touch.

So, if you're into dark movies, death row movies or films that are a bit off-center, then this movie is highly recommended.  If you feel a movie must be uplifting in order to be good, then I recommend you not attend the Monster's Ball.",1109462400,5,1330,4.565400843881856

I even like slow movies and i thoguth this was unwatchable. After looking that there are over 80 one star reviews it makes me feel better inside that people don't actually like this drivel. The plot is ssoo lame and moves slower then molasses. Billy BOb's character is so evil it mkaes me mad. I just can't take this movie.

1677977,5,B00005YU1M,"This is one of the most deeply moving films that I have ever seen. Everything worked. The acting was superb. The script was masterful. Halle Berry richly deserved her academy award. The characters pain, frustration and confusion was palpable.

Unlike so many other films, there was no attempt to glamorize the characters living situation. No angst was played out in a $100,000 dollar Mercedes. These are people who have bills to pay, lonely lives to survive bereft of anything resembling abundance.

I deeply respect the deliberate pacing of the film. The director ( Marc Forster ), wasn't interested in pandering to short attention spans or limited empathy. Sadly, real people truly find themselves in situations where they experience crushing, almost unimaginable suffering. This film examines this realm of existence with honestly, attention to detail and compassion.

Monsters Ball is a masterpiece. I think that anyone who is interested is assembling a well rounded, well considered collection of films will want to own this DVD.",1104019200,10,1034,5.2926829268292686
1677998,2,B00005YU1M,"When I heard the hype about this movie when it first came out (about Halle Barry's makeup, the sex scenes) and now remember the night when Halle Barry became the first black actress to win an Academy Award for her role in this film, i thought, is it that good? I saw a few scenes on HBO, and thought it was interesting, intriguing, and hot. But then when i rented it and watched the WHOLE film, i was left wondering what's the big deal? First of all, the plot of this whole movie was lacking depth, and later on doesn't even seem to have a point to it. And Halle Barry's make up, or lack of it, was nothing special, she still looked like the same Halle Barry to me, except with a country accent. Don't get me wrong, i think Halle Barry is a great actress, and she deserved her Academy Award, but i don't understand what was so special about this role for her to finally get recognized for her talent. Her character lacked personality, and at times she was pretty boring. In fact, this whole film was kind of boring, and slow at times. And i thought the sex scenes weren't as hot and explicit as people hyped it up to be. It was nothing special, it was just too overrated if you ask me. So to conclude this, this film was just OKAY.

Girl, you have to see this movie to believe it!  Miss Thing deserved that Oscar and I hope she'll get more roles like that!",1103587200,3,396,4.171052631578948
1678000,4,B00005YU1M,"I do understand the criticisms that people have put against this film. The sex scenes are explicit, but I feel they are justified. Yes, Leticia (Halle Berry) had been mourning the death of her son and this makes it distinctly uncomfortable viewing. However, in times such as these, the human spirit turns to basic wants, whether comfort eating or sexual pleasure. The difference is not that vast.

The reason I applaud this film so highly is not so much for the acting, as this has been widely admired, but for the directing and the film in general. Things happen suddenly in this film and they often seem random. The end does not tie up neatly. But this, this strange ambiguity is what makes the film so real. Things do occur in life which are random or seem by chance (whether truly random or not is down to your personal belief) - like Hank being the one who passes Leticia and her son in the road, things do not tie up neatly, often you make decisions which are strange but perhaps necessary for you, like Leticia's choice to remain with Hank at the end. Having said that, this is left slightly uncertain and perhaps she does not stay with him.

Neither of the two main characters are perfect. Leticia abuses her child, and Hank is a racist bigot. Once again, this makes the film more true to life - nobody is perfect. I did not personally really sympathise with either of the characters, but it almost didn't matter as the story was still worth telling.

The film made me feel very much an observer, not someone drawn into the film - again this struck me as a sign of truly magnificent directing making this story true to life - you can never be inside someone else's story. You can only observe and emphathise with their story through your own experience, which is precisely what this film makes you do.

People have criticised the implausibility of the sudden love between the two main characters. However, I want to point out that the characters do not at any point say that they love each other, and their relationship seems more a product of mutual need. I think this is realistic - two people in difficult situations, not necessarily in love but keeping each other company. Company is often vastly underrated. I feel this is a film about company in the worst situations.",1102809600,3,2281,4.569682151589242

There is no depth of acting but that is true of a lot of actresses who receive oscars of late. This includes people like Julia Roberts, Hilary Swank, Helen Hunt and so on. They do not have any depth of acting. Actresses like Jodie Foster and Emma Thompson have overall ability and are able to act in different roles with aplomb. Now let us see the story in this movie, a racist person who changes over time and falls in love with an afro-american. She abuses her son for being fat and falls in love with the white person. Apart from small moments, there are very few moments of great acting. Seeing the other movies that she has played it like Tomorrow Never Dies, Catwoman (she was offered a place in Gigli), you can see how shallow her roles are. She was lucky that year as they were handing out the oscars to afro-american actors and actreses. Denzel Washington is another story as he is a class apart.

This movie doesn't make any sense. A black man is on death row and his last day he gets to eat whatever he wants - that's what's called a ""Monster's Ball"" (the last day before the chair). His overweight son and his sexy wife visit, and nothing gets resolved. P. Diddy turns in a lukewarm performance as the father who shows last minute love for his son, an obvious underachiever. Now Halle is alone, but befriends the guy who, unbeknownst to her, is a security guard at the very prison that murdered her husband (I don't care if its state-sanctioned - murder is murder). Thornton turns in his usual deep, yet underplayed performance, treats her like a human being, gets the yams and falls in love. His bigoted father tries to break it up, but Thornton dumps his pops and lets Halle move in. Where in the world is stuff like THIS taking place? This movie was a joke, but Halle is so fine, she can pull anything out of the gutter (except, evidently, ""Catwoman""). Don't waste your money.",1093651200,6,1283,4.417721518987341

 Neither one of these characters are people to sympathize with. The storyline is soooooooooooooooo thin that it's a wonder I can even name two or three things about these people. Halle's character? Hits her kid because he's fat and sneaks food, has sex with a stranger the night her kid dies, then is supposed to live ""happily ever after"" with Thornton's character, eating icecream next to the family cemetery? He's a ""reformed"" racist, I guess, and has sex with hookers that his son has sex with. Yeah, I'm sure a stunningly beautiful woman like Halle Berry (even with the stereotypical name Leticia) would fall for this older, white racist redneck. Please! This was her best performance? Why? Because she had sex in different positions? Wow, I'm blown away. She has even proven herself to be Oscar material with stunning performances in James Bond and Gothika. Wow. Halle has come so far. I guess I shouldn't be down on her too much...I mean, she had the Flintstones before this.

 PS. If you're looking for the ""hot"" sex scene, have fun. It's always so ""hot"" to see a lot of sex when the premise is her character feeling bad that he son just died. Have fun.

Mercy, what was the Academy thinking on that choice?  I thought her performance was unnatural and contrived, and not aided by the fact that her stunning beauty belied her otherwise down and out status (I'm only willing to suspend disbelief to a certain point).
  As for the film itself, it grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.  The mood it establishes, supported by an excellent musical score, almost hypnotizes you.  I was disappointed by the ending, however.  It seemed abrupt and gave me a feeling of incompleteness concerning the film.  The fact that there wasn't much dialogue to uncover the characters along the way only added to this feeling (I felt like I was only starting to get to know these people and then . . . the credits roll).

1678039,1,B00005YU1M,"How did Halle play the race card? Let's compare 2001's Monster's Ball to 1994's Jason's Lyric (unrated version). Once you see the similarities between these two films you'll understand how the race card played in the Oscar win in 2002.
Both Monster's Ball and Jason's Lyric are set in the Deep South. Both stories are bleak.
Both Monster's Ball and Jason's Lyric have troubled primary characters dealing with the death of a loved one Hank Grotowski is dealing with the suicide of his son. Jason is dealing with murdering his own father.
Both male leads are emotionally abused by a family member. Hank is abused by his racist father. Jason is abused by his ne'r do well brother who has been released from prison.
Both Male leads work in low wage jobs. Hank is a prison guard. Jason is a clerk in a TV repair shop.
Both Male leads long for something better. Hank wants to get away from his father. Jason wants to get away from his surroundings.
Both Female leads work in a food service establishment. Leticia Musgrove works as a waitress in a diner. Lyric works as a server in a restauraunt.
Both lead characters come together as a result of troubling circumstances. Hank and Leticia come together as a result of her husband's execution and the death of her son. Jason and Lyric come together as a result of dealing with his brother's problems.
Both films have an obese character. In Monster's Ball it's Leticia's son. In Jason's Lyric the fat person is Lyric's best friend.
Both films feature graphic sex scenes. Monster's Ball features a group of graphic sex scenes between Leticia and Hank where Halle Berry gets nude with Billy Bob Thornton. In addition, there's a graphic sex featuring Heath Ledger and a prostitiute. In Jason's Lyric Jason and Lyric have sex out in a feild. In this graphic sex scene Jada Pinkett and Allen Payne both get nude. In additon, Jada and Allen have sex in the TV repair shop. Furthermore the fat girl and Treach get seminude in an alleyway during their sex scene.
Both films feature suicides. In Monster's Ball, Heath Ledger's character kills himself. In Jayson's Lyric Bokeem Woodbine's character kills himself.
In the end Hank kicks his father out and moves Leticia in. At the end of Jason's Lyric Jason and Lyric finally get on a bus and leave their bleak surroundings once and for all.
Both Monster's Ball and Jason's Lyric were made with low budgets.
The only difference between these two films is that Jayson's Lyric had an ALL BLACK CAST and a BLACK DIRECTOR and Monster's Ball had a MIXED CAST WITH A FOREIGN DIRECTOR. The critics roasted Jason's Lyric; those same critics years later applauded Monster's Ball a film with the exact same plot as Jason's Lyric a film they bashed. Both Jada Pinkett and Halle Berry were given critical acclaim for their perfomances, but the Academy chose to give Halle Berry the Oscar nomination and the win.
Why? The only real difference between these films is the race of the male leads and their family. Billy Bob Thornton was white,and the actors who played his family were white. Allen Payne was black and the actors who played his family were black.
Both films were controversial due to a graphic sex scene. Jada Pinkett's ""performance"" in Jason's Lyric was just as ""riveting"" as Halle Berry's in Monster's Ball. However, Jada Pinkett wasn't lauded as a ""trailblazer"" she didn't get to go on Oprah and talk about how powerful a ""love story""Jason's Lyric was, how great an actress she was, and most of all, she got no Oscar nomination. Worse, they were planning on rating Jayson's Lyric X if the sex scene wasn't cut down some. Why? Because Jason's Lyric was a black film made by a black director. Perhaps if Jada Pinkett would have had a graphic sex scene with a white man instead of a Black one she would have been the one holding the gold statue on Oscar night in 1994",1084838400,10,3847,4.67551622418879

One of the worst parts of this movie was when Hally Berry's character catches her son eating and stuffing the food wrappers in the cushions of the couch, and then screams at him because of his weight and drags him to the bathroom where she forces him onto the scale, all the while telling him how fat he is.
That is a horrible way to treat anyone, especially a child, and it was after that scene that I turned it off.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, for any reason.",1082246400,6,752,4.244755244755245

The story is intensely dramatic, so much so that it loses the realism it struggle so hard to achieve. The circumstance that brings together the central romance is clearly meant to devastate the audience and bring them to tears, but all it does is disappoint.
(...)
By the end of the film, the audience is perplexed as to whether or not they were meant to believe in the characters, or dislike them. Every twist imaginable occurs, most of which are quite predictible. The only noteable thing are the performances.
And what performances they are! With a film like this, poor performances would have destroyed any impact the film could have earned, but everyone here is at the top of their game, from Oscar winning Halle Berry to the critically ignored Heath Ledger, giving a career high performance. But how can anyone mention Ledter when the two leading actors - Billy Bob Thornthon and Berry - are so strong and appealing. I have to admit that I had been rooting for Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge the year Ms. Berry won for this, but after seeing the film, it was a well-earned award. Her performance is the stuff of legends, unlike the film it is contained in.
Unless you are a film fanatic with a strong attention span, this slow, depressing look at ""life in the south"" is one to skip. Noteable only for its performances, Monster's Ball is easily one of the most disappointing good movies made in a long time. It's a shame, too - because these performances would otherwise have been remembered for decades.",1081987200,2,1587,4.691756272401434
1678042,5,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball"" is a great film with an uplifting message for anyone who has the intelligence to pay attention to it.
On the other hand, whoever would rent this movie and expect it to be the sort of family fare to watch while munching popcorn on the couch with Mom and the kids must have rocks in his head.
While I am sympathetic that someone might be offended by some of the nudity and/or situations presented in ""Monster's Ball"", I can't help but wonder why someone with that sort of dispostion would ever rent this movie in the first place.
My suggestion: Try reading the liner notes on the dvd cover, instead of just the title.  That way, your chances of ending up with something you find offensive will be a lot less.  Believe me, I've been to the video rental store lots of times and this technique really works.
We need more films with adult-oriented themes and less teenage-oriented garbage.  Our culture is awash with corporations that generate mindless garbage and pander to a dopey public in order to make a fast buck.  I'm sick of seeing films like ""Ernest goes to Jail III"" and ""Bruce Willis vs. Godzilla"" get promoted to death.
Halle Berry's delivery was awsome, and the story was fresh.  The characters weren't tremendously likeable, but they behaved in understandable terms.  In other words, the decisions the characters made, and the consequences of their actions, set in motion a series of events that made the story convincing.
The only problem I had with the film was that someone as glamorous-looking as Halle Berry probably wouldn't be living such a bummy existence, not even in the deep South.  But, that's poetic license.  The casting of Halle Berry made the part more believeable.  The expression on her face at the film's end contributed to an ending that was powerful, poetic, and hopeful.  I thought the ending to the story was both appropriate and beautiful.
It's refreshing to see something that's creative for a change.  I don't always agree with the Academy of American Cinema, but I can't say enough about how great I think this film is.",1080000000,4,2071,4.740947075208914

1678059,2,B00005YU1M,"A very, very overrated movie. In retrospect, I think Halle Berry --a beautiful and talented actress -- should have gotten an Oscar, but not for this role. She is utterly miscast as a down-and-out waitress whose husband is executed and whose grotesquely fat little boy is run over by a car. Sorry folks, but there is no way, no how, in no universe that a woman who looks like Halle would ever be in this situation. This is the ""trap"" many gorgeous starlettes find themselves in....they want to play serious parts, but their looks make a serious part as a poor waitress or lowlife impossible to believe. (Think of Michelle Pfieffer in ""Frankie and Johnnie"".) With her gorgeous face (even sans makeup), stunning body, delicate Caucasian-looking facial features and perfectly straight hair, she does not look like the average African American woman, let alone one living in wretched poverty in the Deep South. She looks like what she is  -- a beautiful movie star! This alone makes this psuedo-naturalistic movie a kind of bad joke.
Billy Bob Thornton is fine as the bigoted prison guard who falls in love with a black woman and undergoes a big personal transformation, but the role isn't much of a stretch for him. He's very low key in the part, which is OK but not special. Peter Boyle is kinda reprising his ""Everbody Loves Raymond"" role, only in a particularly malevolent way.  I do have to say I feel a lot of doubts about the film's message that the surly old man is best off bundled away in a crummy nursing home, than living with his son...this certainly doesn't send a pro-family, pro-social responsibility message for a film that is supposed to be so upright.
The only big surprise here to me was Heath Ledger. I thought of him mostly as a one-note, teen heartthrob with good looks but little talent. He was surprisingly good here, sensitive and even touching. A lot of energy goes out of the film after his suicide. I think the film might have worked better if it had been his character, Sonny, who had bonded with a local African American woman, rather than his father's. Sonny is the one presented as being more open and less predjudiced than the two older men.
Lastly, the ""big sex scene"". Way overrated. You will be disappointed. It's a bit more graphic than the usual under-the-sheets, wearing underwear sex scenes you get in some movies, but it's ABSOLUTELY NOT PORN, despite some comments on this site. If anything, it's rather grim and depressing.  The characters just seem sad and energyless, and so is the sex -- graphic but joyless, not sensual and no one really seems to be having a good time.

I was embarrassed to let my wife watch this with me - and was in the ""dog house"" for weeks to come, after watching this flick.

1678061,4,B00005YU1M,"Take away all the hype about race and bigotry and in the end you have an intense little movie about two messed up people and the love that changes their lives and saves them.  It features remarkable performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry who of course won the Oscar.
Billy Bob Thornton's character is unhappy in his job as a prison guard, unhappy as a son to revolting father, and unhappy as a father to a messed up son. Leticia is a woman who's had a hard life. Her husband was just executed for murder, she's too fond of sipping on liquor miniatures and she's failed as a mother to her deeply unhappy son.
Any discussion about Monster's Ball eventually gets to the sex scene. Yes, it's raw. There's no romantic lighting or sex scene music. There's no attempt to make the actors look glamorous. It's just two sad people going at it in an attempt to forget their lives for a bit. It's the most unerotic sex scene you've ever seen in a movie and to tell the truth, it could've been a lot shorter or skipped altogether.
The movie has a couple of other flaws. Every human obstacle to the couple's relationship is conveniently done away with. Leticia's husband and son die. Hank's son dies and he packs his bigoted, foul mouthed father off to a black owned nursing home. In real life things don't work out this way and that was the films major hype point: it's supposed raw reality.
Nonster's Ball is not as controversial or as great as the media makes it seem but it is a good movie. It's not something I'd want to watch every week but I'm glad I bought it.",1076198400,5,1566,4.381443298969073

1678095,5,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball gives us an Anti-Hollywood movie, a movie that excels not with eye candy and fads but with brutal realism set in a starkly portrayed southern USA.
I watched Monster's Ball with my wife, who constantly tried to guess out loud what would happen next.  She was wrong every time.  It's that kind of movie.  It's not trying to twist and turn the plot, but it is unexpected because it's not clichd.  Also see: Anti-Hollywood movie.
In the wrong hands, this film could have done the usual Hollywood thing: start preaching about the death penalty or racism.  It didn't do that.  It told a story about two people who are escaping their painful lives by joining together.  The movie has a very explicit sex scene.  It is shown so raw and real because the director needed to prove that Hank was not taking advantage of Leticia or raping her.  The scene showed us that Hank and Leticia's only refuge from the pain in their lives was when they bonded sexually.  If we hadn't seen the actualization of the two characters in the throes of their passion we would have questioned the relationship as it warded off threats the rest of the movie.
It was obvious that many pitfalls lurked in their paths.  The film navigated these in a way that intrigues the viewer.  Again, it is unpredictable.
This is not a feel good movie.  The execution, explicit sex scene, and heaviness were too much for my wife to enjoy the film.  I, on the other hand, appreciated what this film did with the story.  I really enjoyed the minimalist dialogue.  When I look to sum up this film in my mind, I say: here we have a very earthy story that gripped me for the entirety, had no discernable flaws, and was very well performed.

1678097,4,B00005YU1M,"This quiet, sedate film is a powerful observation on human emotions as well as a unique love story.  The plot is rather thread-bare, mainly concerning the gradual acceptance between a distraught widow and a prejudiced prison guard in an impoverished town.  But the payoff is tremendous.  The moment when he accepts her, and the much later moment when she accepts him (in a shining moment of acting that earns Halle Berry the Oscar), are transcendent.  The direction by Marc Forster is rather minimalist and meditative.  Dialogs are sparse and softly-spoken (this could have been a silent film).  There isn't any discourse on racialism or any social issue.  It doesn't offer any acts of heroics, any moral declaration, or any simpleminded resolution. This film is ALL about atmosphere, mood, psychological landscapes, perceptions -- things that are hard to put into words, plots, or dialogs, and can only be handled by the most skillful of filmmakers.  This is one of two types of films that usually bores the average viewer: the type that uses too much visual, aural, and editorial pyrotechnics (such as ""Citizen Kane""), and the type that uses too little.  MONSTER'S BALL is the latter, and it requires an attentive, observant viewing.  There is one graphic sex scene that quite effectively (perhaps a little too effectively) shows how the two protagonists use sex to escape from their depression.  If you like meditative films of this type, such as LEAVING LAS VEGAS, GEORGE WASHINGTON, EYES WIDE SHUT, etc., add MONSTER'S BALL to your must-see list.
Two DVD versions of this film have been released.  The now-discontinued 2002 release has the R-rated version of the film and two audio commentaries (one of which features Halle Berry).  The 2003 DVD release has the director's signature on the cover, and has the unrated version of the film, but only one audio commentary -- newly recorded, but without Halle Berry.

1678124,4,B00005YU1M,"One of the most stunning things about the film is the stark contrast between the quality of the visuals and the incredibly bleak story. The prison, the dusty roads, the stuffy old house that Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and his family live in are all beautiful, as seen through the eye of the cinematographer. I think the visual impact and symbolism that director Marc Forster was attempting in his earlier film EVERYTHING PUT TOGETHER fell flat and at times became heavy-handed and downright corny, but were strikingly present in MONSTER'S BALL.
Thornton follows up his excellent performance in THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE with another role that appears written for him. (From what I know of Thornton, much of Hank's characteristics and background aren't too far from his own. For instance, I couldn't help laughing over his standing order of chocolate ice cream with a PLASTIC spoon, as I know he has many food phobias, among many others.) I was also thoroughly impressed by Halle Berry (as the Academy and so many others proved to be). This was the first time I'd seen her offer a full range of emotions, and she certainly wasn't afraid to delve into raw and ugly realities of life contained within the story. I must also mention the strong supporting cast, including Peter Boyle as Hank's father and Heath Ledger as Hank's son, rounding out his dysfunctional family.
The ""controversial"" sex scene that has been so heavily discussed was one of the saddest moments I've ever seen portrayed on film; so heavy with desperate, awful need.

1678126,4,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball is a prison drama/romance with a difference. It's about tragedy, compassion, forgiveness, humanity and the need for love but this is no traditional Sunday afternoon made for television weepie. Brilliantly acted by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry, Monster's Ball is an intelligent but often bleak drama, subtly directed and utterly compelling.
The title, Monster's Ball is explained as being a condemned man's last supper before being executed. The condemned man in this case being Lawrence Musgrove (Sean 'Puff Daddy'/'P Diddy' Combs) an African-American who has been awaiting execution in a Georgia penitentiary for 11 years. Musgrove is married to a long suffering emotionally crushed waittress named Leticia (Halle Berry). Together they share an obese 13 year old son Tyrell who barely knows his father and seeks solace in junk food and candy bars.
Supervising officer on Musgrove's execution squad is one Hank Grotowski (Thornton), a widower and one of three generations of career prison officers. Hank's only child Sonny (Heath Ledger), a sensitive but unloved young man, is also reluctantly on the execution squad. Together they both live with Hank's retired father Buck, a bitter, nasty and brutal rascist physically disabled by the combination of chronic arthritis and emphysema. The wives of both Buck and Hank have committed suicide and all 3 generations of the Grotowski family are trapped in unhappy lives devoid of feeling, emotionally numbed and it is against this backdrop that enormously tragic circumstances conspire to bring Hank and Leticia together in this fragile love story.
As previously mentioned both Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry give stunning performances and contrary to popular opinion Berry's Academy Award was more than justified. Rather than being an act of political correctness it is actually one of the very few occasions where the Academy have actually got things right. Demonstrating a superb range of acting and range of emotions beyond most mere mortals Berry gives a touching and memorable performance as a woman crushed by an unfortunate catalogue of misfortune. Likewise, Thornton (one of American cinemas greatest talents) is captivating as an unloving bigot, bullied by his father and bully to his son, who begins a journey to back to life and emotional and spiritual salvation.
This is a very adult, unsentimental and intelligent drama that doesn't pull its punches. It's not what could be described as entertainment as the first hour of the movie particularly presents an increasingly bleak story of grief, loss and tragedy. However, as an examination of the human condition and our intrinsic need for love this is very powerful and thought provoking stuff, which against all odds ends on a positive note of hope. Uncompromisingly well written and directed, Monster's Ball also features great supporting performances (against type) by the likes of Heath Ledger and a surprisingly sombre Sean Combs.

1678129,2,B00005YU1M,"If a movie is to address the complex issues of interracial relationships and existential plight, it should at least do so effectively and, more importantly, competently.  Instead, MONSTER'S BALL is a film plagued by inconsistency, bad writing, confusing plot development, and--in the case of Halle Berry--overacting that literally is embarrassing to watch.
Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is a corrections officer with a penchant for ice cream (Why doesn't this guy weigh 400 pounds?) who hates his son (Heath Ledger).  We really aren't given a reason why he hates his son, he just does.  And of course, Hank's father (Peter Boyle) is a hardline Southern bigot who says hardline bigoted things, and the only thing this family has in common is a blonde prostitute who has a most intriguing way of initiating contact with her clients.  When tragedy befalls the Grotowskis relatively early in the film, we aren't given enough information about these three characters to assess or understand what happened; we only see Hank react by quitting his job, then we see him slouch and mumble through the rest of the film.
Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry) is an irresponsible, really bad parent whose husband just happens to be on death row.  Call it ""random fate"" if you will, but Hank appears in her life just as she is trying to cope with unspeakable tragedy of her own.  Misery loves company, and apparently it also loves mumbling and
melodramatic acting on a couch (with frequent tumbles to the floor) while a mysterious hand bothers a fluttering bird inside its cage.
An Andy Warhol moment.
Having vigorously--athletically--consummated their relationship, MONSTER'S BALL explores the subsequent uneven actions of Hank and Leticia as their lives become more intertwined, as the script becomes goofier, as the ad libbed lines become almost laughable.  And, as it should be, the film promtply dissolves into an anticlimactic non-ending.
Pass the ice cream.
My first reaction was to give this movie one star, but hey, it was so much of a mess I had to stop and think about it, then watch some of it over again (particulary the wrestling scene on the couch).  At least the strength and conditioning coach for the actors should get some credit.  Two stars.

Wow, was I wrong! Instead, it's about a Southern white man named Hank (played by Billy Bob Thornton) who overcomes racism & falls in love with a black woman named Leticia (Halle's character). They each cope with the death of a son, on top of the fact that Hank, while a corrections officer, had conducted the execution of Leticia's husband. It's all so, so heartbreaking.
On the downside, some scenes were quite graphic & disturbing. There's even more nudity here than in Swordfish (famous for a Halle topless scene), so this really pushes the envelope, even for an R movie. The sex scenes between Halle & Billy Bob looked so realistic that I hoped Billy Bob was wearing a condom! As for that blonde prostitute, I don't see why she needed to be in there at all.
But on the upside, I loved the DVD commentary by Billy Bob, Halle & the director. Halle notes how Peter Boyle (Hank's father in the movie) is nice & hospitable in real life, yet he could play characters with totally opposite attitudes. It's sad that Billy Bob had to exit the commentary during the last 20 minutes or so, but I like Halle's comment that she wishes for a sequel, that Leticia could find herself pregnant or something. That led me to think, wouldn't it be nice indeed if those characters could not only start life anew, but start a family anew as well?

Given that the director of the film is from Holland perhaps it is not surprising that the film has the slower, more sensitive, pacing of a European film.
This is definitely not a film that will appeal to all viewers. Many of those who have reviewed it here seem to have been incapable of appreciating the subtlety of its characterisations. For instance, the character played by Billy Bob Thornton is not a bigot - he is rather a man living under the shadow of his bigotted father. The film portrays the way the ""sins of the fathers"" are visited upon the sons brilliantly.
As for the explicit sex scene that so many reviewers can't seem to see past, it is one of the most touching depictions of human frailty to make it to the cinema screen in decades.

1678163,4,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball"" is a thoroughly engrossing film that is at times both intensely depressing and uplifting.  The performances by Thornton and Berry are absolutely superb and are really at the heart of what makes this film work, and even Ledger and Combs do very good jobs with their supporting roles.  At times the plot is a bit rushed and unrealistic, but these performances manage to keep the whole thing afloat during these few moments when the plot falters a bit.
The film itself deals with many serious issues including racism, capital punishment, interracial couples and death, and while there is certainly strong commentary presented on these topics, the film does a good job of not becoming preachy in its sentiments.  Underlying all of these more obvious issues are the more personal and character driven issues dealt with by the main characters.  Thornton is a man struggling to find himself and his true identity while attempting to finally escape the legacy of bigotry and ignorance handed down to him by his father.  Meanwhile, Berry's character undergoes a transformation spurred on by pain and personal loss and the effort to cope with her position as a black woman in the south.  Together, the two characters are able to scrape beneath the surface of who society percieves them to be by getting in touch with their own, and each other's, basic humanity.  Through a combination of overwhelming pain and strength, loss and gain, they experience a rebirth into a new life.

Just because more movies are showing miscegenation does not automatically translate into being consciously aware of race relations in this country.
The underlying message in Monster's Ball shows that interracial relations DO NOT work. How convenient to make these two characters lose everything precious to them, I'm referring to the children both Berry's and Thornton's characters lost. It would be too sticky, too challenging for these characters not to be such tragic victims and still find their way to each other.
As for Berry winning the Oscar, that was a joke, and I agree with the reviewer in pondering how America views Black people.

1678166,4,B00005YU1M,"There has been considerable negative criticism of this film, and I think it arises from the simple fact that it is not in the least what most viewers expect it to be.  Although it sports two well-known stars and expensive production values, Marc Forster's MONSTER'S BALL is essentially an art film that is unlikely to appeal to the mainstream audiences that rushed to see in the wake of Halle Berry's historic Oscar win.
The story is Southern Gothic to the max, playing with grotesque plot devices worthy of Flannery O'Connor and twisted characters that might have stepped out of a Tennessee Williams play. Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is a correctional officer with the Georgia prison system, where he works with a team that executes prisoners condemned to the electric chair. During the course of his duties, he participates in the execution of Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs)--an execution that, in the most unexpected way imaginable, leads to the violent death of his son (Heath Ledger.) He subsequently becomes acquainted with Lawrence's widow Leticia (Halle Berry), and when she too loses her only son (Coronji Calhoun) to violent death the two embark on a passionate affair fueled by their grief and bitterness.
The film plays with a number of ideas and issues, chief among them racism, but at core it is about the emotional sterility and shallow lives of its characters, and none of them are greatly likable.  This is particularly true of the two leads, who are abusive, frustrated, and bitter--until their unexpected affair forces them to evolve in new directions.  Even so, their motives remain problematic, and the conclusion of the film offers little in the way of closure.
While the plot relies on several improbable coincidences, director Forster and his actors make the most of it, and the result is a film that is truly painful in its intensity. While Halle Berry's performance has been justly celebrated, it is equaled by Billy Bob Thornton--and the supporting cast is equally remarkable. The cinematography and music is at once understated and extremely memorable, and the film as a whole has a desperate darkness that few others in recent memory have equaled.
This is not a film that a great many people will like, for it creates a brooding quality that is deliberately left unresolved.  But it is a haunting film, one that lingers in the mind long after the final credits have rolled. While the DVD is expertly crafted, I found the bonus features--which include various audio tracks, outtakes, and a short on the making of the soundtrack--fairly trivial. Recommended to viewers who appreciate bitter drama at its most intense.

The PREMISE of the movie is good... (Wife of a convicted murderer falls in love with prison guard from the prison where her husband was put to death.)  There were a few scenes that were not needed however: (1) execusion scene is quite graphic, (2) The father killing his son -- seemed to have no purpose in the film except to add extra and unnecessary family violence, (3) the intimacy between Hally Barry's and Billy Bob Thorton's character could have been really loving and sensual, EXCEPT that Hally Berry's character is really drunk... which is legally rape, but the film makes no mention of that (which is interesting since Billy Bob's character is a prison guard).

1678171,1,B00005YU1M,"When I saw the Monster's Ball at the movie theatre for the first time a year ago shock was the first thing that came to my mind.  The screenplay was very well written, but the [traditional roles] left me thinking how could Halle Berry play such of a role.  Then I thought again if she didn't play the role then someonelese would, which still left me even more depressed and disappointed.  Halle Berry played every negative ...typical role that black women had to play in American cinematography since the beginning of time which have been mammy, maid and [women of the night].
Ms. Berry played the role of mammy by being an ignorant mother who basically did not know how raise her son, but disciplined through beatings so severe and savage like that they were abusive. Next Ms. Berry, played a maid by working in a restaurant serving whites mostly and where she meets the male protagonist played by Billy Bob Thornton.  Finally, how Ms. Berry plays the most appalling role of all that of a [woman of the night].  I couldn't believe how Berry's character begged for ... relations with Mr. Thornton it disgusted me.
I would like to say that most of mainstream America found this film to be a great, so great that Halle Berry won an Oscar.  I would like to know, is this how America views black people here in this country as mammies, maids, [women of the night], coons, toms and bucks? just waiting to be saved by that white knight.

What I do expect is a story to be told with reasonable amount linearity.  Questions: What are the odds of a prison guard on death row falling for an executed inmate's spouse?  Why is the relationship between Hank and Sonny (father and son) terrible?  Why don't we see Halle Berry's character being more proactive in trying to help her overweight son than verbally and physically abuse him?  Beside the possibility of feeling sorry for Halle's character what reasons drove Billy Bob Thornton's character to cease from being a bigot?  These are just some of the problems with this film and beside being boring
scenes I feel I wasted my time watching this movie.
There are many gaps in this film that should have been addressed before moving on to a new scene, questions that any reasonble person should have answered.  I did not find this film entertaining and felt like I was watching a soft porn movie in sex scenes that overstayed its welcome.

I thought I'd seen it all until I saw this movie which hits the bottom of the barrel for [rubbish].  As far as believability in the plot, none, nada, zilch.  Just what are the odds that so many coincidences of fate that could possibly come together so conveniently?  Not much!  A much better plot would be Alice In Wonderland for strangeness.  Therefore, I found it entirely unbelievable.
As for Ms. Berry in her role, WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?  I guess her next move would be to become a porn star.  Why she would even want to or accept an award for such a piece of filth is beyond me.  I'd think she would rather want to hide her head in shame.  I'll bet sometime later, she will come to look at this much the same as Sidney Poitier did for his role in Porgy & Bess.
As for Thorton, I really didn't expect much anyway.  White [rubbish] is still white [rubbish].  You can't much improve on that.",1051142400,4,1032,4.402116402116402

If people want to see ... (or just see Halle's ...) watch another film, i.e. Swordfish.  At least there is a movie that is interesting enough to keep me watching.  During Monster's Ball, I had the urge to just turn the movie off and sit in my overheated non-airconditioned apartment.  I didn't even have cable at the time.

1678188,3,B00005YU1M,"Arriving without much fanfare, MONSTER'S BALL - SPECIAL EDITION is an extended version but not called a director's cut.  What it does is significantly expand the famous nude love scene between Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry.  In fact, it looks like every foot of film from all camera angles has been included.
Gratuitous nudity is not necessarily a bad thing, but this longer scene made me feel like a peeping Tom. Still, this is a gripping love story that knowingly plays with and against racial stereotypes. Interesting extras: Sundance Channel's anatomy of a scene, and cast and director interviews.",1049241600,3,606,5.05
1678189,5,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball is gritty and real. I have never gotten so close to characters in a movie before.  Heath Ledger, Billy Bob Thornton, and Halle Berry brought simple, everyday people to a very personal level.
  My favorite things about this film have to be the intriguing camera angles, the articulate accents of the cast, and the movie's decor.  I enjoyed the angles and movements.  I loved Ledger's husky southern accent, and I thought I could literally smell and taste the different sets-the diner, Berry's dirty apartment, and Thornton's tidy, musky home.
  The movie has many obvious metaphors that drove me crazy.  I don't say this in a bad way.  I noticed that glass windows, white walls, and paint all run in themes throughout the film.
  The director does a fabulous job of portraying a southern, racist family that begins a metamorphis from chance encounters.
Every event leads to another. Every person is linked by fate.
  I was disturbed but awed by the powerful performances given by every cast member.  It is extrememly obvious from the beginning that Halle Berry is indeed deserving of her Academy Award.
  I enjoyed Monster's Ball very much. I'm not certain I would purchase this film. Monster's Ball is genuinely Oscar worthy, but a bit too intense for frequent entertainment(for me).  I definitely don't mind the small ping of wonder I have in the pit of my stomach after having watched this movie, so I would highly recommend this film to all.",1048550400,11,1459,4.865853658536586
1678190,4,B00005YU1M,"Halle Berrie's accomplishment as the first African-American to win a Best Actress Oscar may have eclipsed the substance of this film, and that may be unfortunate to some extent. Here, Berrie's character of Leticia Musgrove is about to become widowed by way of her husband's execution by the Georgia Department of Corrections. In its wake, Leticia is drawn to Billy Bob Thornton's character of Hank Grotowski, a correctional officer who assists in the execution. Their attraction is strengthened but strained on both personal and social levels by the deaths of their respective children. What follows for both is an uncertain journey that evokes questions about racism, the inequities of the criminal justice system and the South's unspoken social disdain for interacial coupling. Director Marc Forster could easily have doomed his film to being another unremarkable social commentary but manages a stellar but unsettling film of substance with incredible character development. Neither Berrie nor Thornton's characters elicit much sympathy at film's start, but we actually come to feel some empathy for their lost souls and get some hope for their redemption in the film's last line, from Thornton: ""I think we're gonna be alright."" Not only is ""Monster's Ball"" difficult to watch, it's wrenching, and some scenes may actually shock, especially the one in which Berrie physically abuses her son for being overweight. In the end, though, Berrie does emerge from some kind of moral ambiguity to try to begin anew, and her performance is truly astonishing. But Thornton is no less so, and he is simply riveting! Here, he gives us yet another dimension of his obviously multi-faceted talent, and we come to feel nothing but empathy and respect for his character. More than a anti-comment on social and racial inequities, ""Monster's Ball"" makes that comment all the more powerful by giving us characters of incredible realism.",1047945600,7,1921,5.260586319218241

Yet, I do admire that it is one of the few movies that I've seen that shows that change is gradual. sometimes it is the smallest, most seemingly inconsequential things that help one to overcome the ruts we've buried ourselves in. So, the very things that made me uncomfortable as a viewer, I also admired. I admired that they wouldn't spoon feed me with pat answers and long soliloquies of why this happened or what everyone was feeling. I admired that it took the risk of being so dang uncomfortable.
The much mentioned sex scene--that was long. and a little gratutious. almost as if they decided that after the starkness and brutality we had seen up until this point, we needed to be won over by some t and a. yet, I also felt that it was one of the most obvious displays of the characters' desperation.
I don't know. if nothing else, it comes to back to mind, several times after the viewing. and it might give you a warm, fuzzy feeling simply because your life is very likely much nicer than theirs.",1046390400,8,1247,4.522123893805309
1678192,1,B00005YU1M,"His review hit the nail on the head.  I rented it thinking it must be good, after all Halle Berry won the oscar for it right??????  First, after 5 minutes, I had to chase my son and daughter out of the room.  Knew what was coming - better get them out of there!  Had no clue that was just a sampling of what was to come later with Berry and THornton.
The main problem I had with this movie was it seemed like they left about 1/4 of the movie for us to see and apparently 3/4 must be on some cutting room floor.  That is the only explanation for all the missing pieces of this puzzle that is suppose to be a great movie.  What the heck was going on with Sonny and his father?  Why did the father hate the son so much.  Before you even get a chance to actually get this whole question through your mind, BANG! the son is dead.  No explanation, just bury him quick! (I actually had to turn off the movie at the point where the ""funeral"" happened. I was so shocked by that scene.)
Then we are expected to believe that Thornton's character has a complete turnaround about his ""racial"" prejudice.  I for one really didn't feel he had a prejudice anyway.  Except for the scene where he chases the 2 boys off his property - wasn't that really for the granddad's sake anyway.  Then the make out scene.  I agree, that scene could have been in a porn movie and it just went on and on. And if anybody believes the ending was good, please tell me why.  I kept waiting for another scene.
All in all, I really hated this movie.  Heath Ledger's appearance in this movie isn't even enough to make me watch this movie again.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone to watch.",1046304000,7,1651,4.177215189873418
1678213,5,B00005YU1M,"I've been reading some of the negative Amazon.com reviews of this film in general and Halle Berry's performance in particular.  As everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion, I must say that I vehemently disagree with all of the slamming reviews.  USA TODAY's December 25, 2001 review said it best that ""'Monster's Ball' shows that Halle Berry had a spectacular performance inside her just waiting to be unleashed, and that Billy Bob Thornton had a third one [after ""Bandits"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There""] in his awesome 2001 stockpile.""  After seeing this film, I agree 100%.
In particular, Berry gives the best on-screen performance of her entire career.  Not only does she get by on the sheer brute force of her acting, but Berry appears to have pulled the necessary emotional resources from her very bone marrow to encapsulate the role of Leticia Musgrove, a self-loathing woman who seems to get dealt one bad hand after another.  She and Thornton's character, Hank Grotkowski (a death row prison guard and second-generation bigot), represent two damaged souls who come to need each other to maintain what little sanity that remains in the insane world that surrounds them.  Thornton should have received an Oscar nomination for his performance, and the #1 reason that Berry snagged the Best Actress Oscar at the 74th Academy Awards on March 24, 2002 is because, quite simply, she deserved it.  Period.  Dorothy Dandridge is probably still smiling.",1046044800,5,1455,5.033333333333333
1678214,1,B00005YU1M,"Honestly, I'm not a big fan of anti-racism films because they're all pretty much the same.  Not to mention this is the most horrible one yet.
Billy Bob Thornton plays a Police Officer working on Death Row, who has recently put a black man to death.  He later meets the man's widow, a black waitress played by Halle Berry.  The two begin to develop a romantic relationship and Thornton's racism is put to the test.
Like most anti-racism films, this one had potential to be a good movie.  However, everything in it is so flawed it wasn't even worth my time.  First of all, the sex scene.  I don't mind sex scenes in films, but is it really necessary to have it that long and graphic?  I got the point after the first time.  It just made the scene more and more uninteresting as it went along.  The entire rest of the film is filled with a loathable supporting cast, most notably Peter Boyle, who plays Billy Bob Thornton's extremely racist father.  Now, if you're going to have unlikable characters in a film, they can't just be braindead hicks!
The rest of the film's problems lies in its overbearing screenplay which left me thinking, ""What is the point in all this?""  That racism is bad?  If you're going to tell me that, which I really don't need to be told in the first place, tell it to me well.  Don't just throw a bunch of grotesque images onto the screen and expected me to care.
The one good thing about this movie is the surprisingly watchable performance given by Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs.  All the other performances are mostly forgettable (Halle Berry was NOT Oscar-worthy), which is surprising, considering there are such good actors in it.  If all you care to see is Halle Berry's breasts, then you will probably like this film.  Otherwise, if you want a good anti-racism film, just rent Jungle Fever.",1045699200,10,1812,4.529230769230769
1678215,5,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball"" is an astonishingly beautiful film. Perhaps as much a love story as anything else, this wonderful, uplifting work of art was hampered from finding a wider audience by its misleadingly grim title and too much publicity about its scenes involving a state penitentiary (which, not to give anything away, end early in the film). Instead, this is a deeply compelling story about the redemptive power of love and the ability of people to find happiness by overcoming their past. Every scene is absorbing, the script is amazing, and the actors are astounding. Halle Berry earned (and I mean ""earned"") an Oscar for her role, and Billy Bob Thornton deserved one. It's incredible what he can do by doing so little; with just a slight glance or small shrug, he conveys volumes. Get past the poor title; this is a wonderfully entertaining, uplifting, life affirming, beautiful film that you will thoroughly enjoy.",1045267200,3,918,5.006535947712418

The movie was ok and Halle's acting was good, but she didn't deserve to win Best Actress and its ashame that she became the first black woman to win an award for that role. My opinion is Angela Bassett should have won for What Love Got To Do With It. Most people I know who have seen this movie more than twice, saw it because of the ""love"" scenes. I also find it hard to believe that a bigot can change his mind about black people in one night. Also what period was this movie base from? The 50's or the 90's. Its hard to figure out. Also I could tell that a man from Europe directed this movie. That's not a diss, but an admiration for their view on race and women of color.

Or at least be able to empathize with those in their positions. I was able to do just that. Growing up in the south and seeing for myself the invisible line that divides the races and the cultural taboo of interracial relationships brought the film closer to home for me. I think it was excellently done. Halle Berry's role was deep and hard to play and she did very well. She deserved any award and recognition she got her performance. Great movie! I do agree, however, that the ending did disappoint me. It would have added a great dramatic climax if they had explored Halle's finding out about Billy Bob's involvement in her husband's execution.",1043366400,3,785,4.535211267605634
1678218,1,B00005YU1M,"Indeed, I must agree with so many other reviewers that this was one of the most moving films I've ever seen: it moved my feet straight out the room. It also moved my stomach in ways that shouldn't be discussed in public forum. My eyelids were also moved STRAIGHT DOWN. About the only thing that didn't move was the plot. My girlfriend made me watch it in return for making her watch 'Vanilla Sky', and the only way I could survive was by throwing in frequent jibes. Most of which ran along the lines of 'was that supposed to be a plot point?' 'Well, my life is a hollow lie' and 'Eeeeennnnndddd' and then it did, and I was left totally bewildered.
Okay, before I get blown off as some uncultured moron who can't wait for Steven Seagal's next film, I'd like to say that I was actually optimistic about this one. It got solid reviews from people who have loved great films like 'Mulholland Dr' and 'Memento'. And I do enjoy a well crafted romance story like 'What Women Want' and 'The Bachelor'. But this was neither well-crafted or romantic. If films had an EKG, this sucker flat-lined about ten minutes in when Heath Ledger shoots himself ('was that supposed to be a plot point?'). The 'plot' itself was less substantial than a twinkie. Billy Bob Thornton (I'm sorry but I can't take this man seriously) plays a Corrections Officer, something my Dad has done in real life for a number of years. Ledger is his son, Sonny (boucoup points in the creative naming there), who is appearantly searching for a fullfilling relationship but his upbringing hasn't taught him how to find it. I say 'appearantly' because the entirety of his part is a quick romp with some random girl, botching Puffy Combs' execution, being yelled at by Thornton, then shooting himself for no appearant reason. The purile love story between Thornton and Halle Berry (whose carreer has been a long line of miracles of mediocrity) is so utterly simplistic, yet insanely complicated that it feels like a High school romance rather than an adult relationship. Maybe that was the point, but how is that entertaining? Berry tries vainly to get her son to let go of his father, Combs, by drawing his focus to his own short-comings. She focuses her own sorrow into getting him to loose weight for about five seconds, by slapping him around for eating chocolate. Thornton broods around because the son he hated is dead? ('Well, my life is a hollow lie') Then he and Berry start their 60s-esque High School romance, then they sleep together in a scen that is so dark (visually) that I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be sexy or a dark cave. Suddenly Berry's son is gone. He just disappears off the face of the Earth. Which is okay because he served no purpose whatsoever (much like the rest of the characters). Just as I'm screaming 'End' at my TV Thornton sits on the porch, rubs Berry's back and says 'It'll b okay' then the credits rolled and I had no idea what happened. The ending was so abrupt I wondered if the DVD had a scratch and had skipped a bunch of stuff. Nope, it just ended that way.
Basically, I'm still trying to figure out why in the name of everything good and pure this film was made. I realize that this is a pretty acurate portrayal of actual lives, but so what? Are people's personal lives really so dull and meaningless that this is the proxy they choose to add meaning to their grind? There are lots of real lives out there, why make a movie about the hopelessly immature and miserable? I'm sorry, but the endless pain and suffering of my fellow human beings is not entertainment, it's sadistic. This movie had no meaning, no artistic vision. Granted it was directed by a Swede, so I can't be too hard on it. But this film is to be skipped, buried, and remembered only by Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1043280000,15,3791,4.535766423357664
1678219,3,B00005YU1M,"I suppose it depends on whether or not you're reviewing a film as an artistic statement or a beautifully told story and so forth, or if you're rating it as something one would purchase to watch again and again.
Monster's Ball is the sort of spellbinding story that's typically released in theaters around late December to win awards and garner free publicity for the ever-shrinking number of movie studios and the media-conglomerates that own them. Halle Berry is truly outstanding in this and I'd highly recommend Monster's Ball to anyone that hasn't seen it.
Having thus said however, I'd be somewhat disturbed to meet the person who would actually want to watch Monster's Ball frequently enough to purchase it. It's certainly worth seeing, but is horribly depressing and morbid--.... To wit, I like Dali's painting of the crucifiction of St. John but I don't want the thing hanging in my living room.

1678220,4,B00005YU1M,"This movie tackles some very controversial topics.  It centers around two main characters.  The first is Hank Grotowski, played by Billy Bob Thornton.  Hank is a death row corrections officer at the prison.  The second character is Liticia Musgrove, played by Halle Barry.  Leticia's husband, played by Sean Combs, is scheduled to die and Hank helps conduct the execution.  After the execution, both Liticia and Hank lose their children to tragic deaths; Hank's son by suicide and Liticia's son by a hit-and-run driver.  Hank actually sees Liticia and her son along the road after the accident and he takes them to the hospitsl, but it was too late.  Afterwards, an unlikely bond forms between Hank and Liticia.
Several controversial topics are brought to life in this movie.  Racism is evident throughout.  Hank's father is a hard-core racist and he makes it known to anyone he sees, including Liticia. Hank tries to distance himself from his father after meeting and ultimately falling in love with Liticia.
The death penalty is also shown in the movie.  Liticia's husband is executed in the electric chair, which is hardly used as a method of capital punishment anymore.  The hardships on the family after the execution are shown, as well as their methods of coping.  Liticia's son dealt with the loss of his father by eating large amounts of candy, while Liticia drank and was evicted from their home.
Finally, the relationship between Liticia, a black woman, and Hank, an older white man, was dealt with.  I think the forming of the relationship was done pretty well throughout the movie.

This movie won awards that should have gone to controversial and politically progessive films made years ago. I am convinced that guilt for not recongizing previous attempts to address these issues is the only reason ""Monsters"" even made it to the theaters. Halle Berry almost gave a very believable performance except for the sex scenes which were almost as bad as highlights from ""Showgirls"".

Berry and Thornton do a good job acting in this, and it is engrossing albeit an ugly movie.  It fails in its realism with just plain too many bad things happening to its characters.

In each vignette, I found myself caring for the characters and their subsequent perils.

This filmed deserved every accolade it recieved.
The DVD is good. The picture quality was nice and the sensory details given to the sound production are to be commended. It pays off when you hear the small sounds of Halle Berry when she's brushing her teeth or chewing gum. That says a lot about the detail in the film and with the sound. The special features were OK. Personally, I could've done without the goofy extras because I feel that it takes away from the ethos and intense drama of the film -- this is Monster's Ball, not Monsters Inc.

1678245,5,B00005YU1M,"This film should be shown in every American History class, as it captures the essence of American racial/social history as well as showing some rays of hope for a better future in American race relations.
Billy Bob Thornton puts in another top-notch performance (can't remember the last time I saw him give a BAD performance) as a man who helps electrocute people for a living.  His father is a classic Southern conservative redneck---ossified, miserable and misery-spreading---whose poison makes his son a casual racist and equally miserable and repressed male, who drives his own son to suicide.  At which point Thornton and Berry's paths meet (a series of fortuitous catastrophes and coincidences which slightly stretch credulity) and their relationship transforms him away from the redneck Neaderthal paradigm of his father, whom he finally puts away where he belongs---in a nursing home (ironically run by mostly black people!) so he can rot away without ruining his son's life anymore.
That one night with Berry could so completely transform a man is a bit hard to swallow, as drop-dead gorgeous a woman as she is, but somehow Thornton makes us believe it's possible.  Berry finds out that Thornton is one of the men who helped execute her husband (who she no longer loved anyway) and is stunned but doesn't hold it against him.  The beautiful thing about this film is that as the camera fades out at the end, we are not subjected to the typical Hollywood cornball ending of a Big-Happy-Wedding-and-Happily-Ever-After riding off into the sunset that cheesier directors (e.g. the earlier Spielberg) would've taken.  Instead you see the two of them side by side looking up at the stars---tentatively, not completely sure of each other and where they're going, but quietly daring to hope for better days ahead, together.
""Monster's Ball"" is perhaps a meditation on what has to die in order for other things to live.  Berry's husband, her semi-retarded son; Thornton's own son (his blood sacrifice) and not soon enough, his miserable and evil redneck father.  It suggests, darkly, that those things which hold us down must wither away before we can hope to fly again.
Reality and American history is what it is, so if you're looking for quick-and-lazy emotional-candy/escapism then stick with the kitschy garbage that comprises the other 95% of Hollywood movies.",1040860800,8,2364,5.108808290155441

1678269,3,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball
Wow...and they say that David Lynch films are obscure and pointless. Monster's Ball is a difficult & fun film to review. Halle Berry - while mesmerizing to look at - is downright bizarre as she's hitting her fat child and screaming about his obesity. Her svelte figure next to his rotund one is a study in contrasts unbefitting of the time, place and situation of this story...but then what are the time, place and situation of this story? When she is ranting and raving before giving herself to Billy Bob in the moment of despair- errr, I mean passion - was this the moment that clenched the Oscar? Do women who look like Berry (or any women for that matter) really sleep naked when their son is in the next room and no one else is in the house? No wonder he was cramming chocolate bars down his throat.
Billy Bob Thornton is disturbing and entertaining as the offbeat racist turned master-hero of political correctness. His performance in this film seems a microcosm of his actual transformation from southern good ole' boy to Hollywood darling. Ribs to tofu can happen in two hours!!! The only problem is that if you're actually from the South, you'll have trouble figuring out what Billy Bob is all about. At times he is convincing and almost enjoyable in his role as a perplexed, jaded I-don't-know-what.  At others you are left wondering if he is the long lost love child of Ned Beatty's interlude in the woods from you-know-where.
Whoever cast Heath Ledger must have thought that his muffled grunt would suppress any Australian and successfully pass for effective Southern twang, not to mention that genetically he's not too convincing as Billy Bob's son... Strange scenes like him callously banging in the hotel room and vomiting in the hallway make it seem like he detested every moment of the picture ... I don't blame him...
The music is haunting and mysterious while the camera work does at times evoke wonder.
Halle Berry does transfix, but not always in a good way in this film. She seems far more convincing shopping for the hat than pawning the ring.
Billy Bob seemed on the verge of laughter, especially in the Oscar stealing performance of his co-star as she again waxes non-poetic about her son's obesity...then segues with no subtlety to sexual moans!?! ...at least don't try to pass this off as aphrodisiac/foreplay.
And then the sex scene made me want to vomit. Alas, Heath beat me to it.
I cannot decide if this film was intended to be satire, parody or sincere drama. I felt guilty while laughing at it. In terms of ""moments to feel sorry for the actor because of the writing"" it's a toss up between Berry's doe-eyed ""I know I'm hot and that will carry this film far"" look and Billy Bob's ""I could write better after 10 Jack and Cokes.""
All-in-all l did pay attention to the characters and the film kept me watching to the very end, but the writing of this tale left something (other than Halle Berry) to be desired.

1678270,5,B00005YU1M,"This cleverly simple, but well balanced plot is well known by now and if you don't know it, it doesn't matter much, as the acting carries this film. Billy Bob Thorton again plays a southern hick (a Corrections Officer), a character he does so well at. His father (Peter Boyle) also plays a great bigot (something he began in 1970's ""Joe""). Billy Bob's son played by Heath Ledger, again plays his typical character role as a hick with a conscience. Now, it is Ms. Halle Berry that breaks rank and shows her best in a shockingly well-acted part as a single mother waitress. I saw ""X-Men"" and didn't expect anything out of Berry, but she went for broke and plays such a convincing character, I was happy she won that Oscar!
Again, it's a simple plot, but not one without merit, as it explores some serious issues of racism, bigotry, inter-racial relationships, child abuse, obesity, murder, suicide - and does it with a deft and staight forward tone. Quite a load for a 'small' film. It's not a happy picture and at times can be terribly depressing. But, the script also keeps it afloat with realistic dialogue, taken well advantage of by the cast.

A very powerful scene in the car (before Leticia asks Hank to come inside) where Hank had a hard time getting the words out while explaining why he helped Leticia and her son. He had to come to grips with his own humanity (rather than his racist roots) and the feelings he started to feel for her.

At first, Hank doesn't seem to like blacks, but that all changes when a black man (Sean ""P.Diddy"" Combs) is put to death. He has a strained relationship with his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger) who also works as a Death Row prison guard at the same prison, and elderly father. It turns out that the black man who was put to death was the husband of Leticia (Hallie Berry), a black woman who works as a waitress at the restuarant Hank always goes to at the end of the day. After Sonny committs suicide because he feels his father doesn't love him, Hank quits the prison guard job and opens up a gas station. During all of this, Hank comes across Leticia who is also suffering from the loss of her husband and the death of her child who was hit by a car. They unexpectedly fall in love, and learn to live with their losses and each other.
Great performances from the entire cast...especially Hallie Berry; she deserved the Oscar. But the film itself isn't really all that entertaining.

1678300,4,B00005YU1M,"Monster's ball's main problem is that it tries to make reference to too many aspects of the US southern life, and in the end, none of these aspects are treated with necessary depth they deserve.
The movie tells the story of two very different people brought together by chance. Billy Bob Thronton is a state prison guard in charge of executions. His father legacy was racism. In the first scenes of the movie he uses a shotgun to make two black kids go away from his property. And he is in charge of a black man's execution in the electric chair. But the viewer is able to see that, although Billy Bob does that racist stuff, he's not very comfortable with them.
Hale Berry is the wife of the condemned man. Her life is going down the drain. After her husband's death, she has to work in a cafeteria and try to raise a son with weight problems.
These two troubled lives meet, and among personal problems and tragedies they try to build a life together.
Billy Bob, as always, is in excelent acting shape. Hale Berry is a very beautiful woman and an amazing actress, and they both do a series of strong scenes during the movie, though some of them are a little bit extreme. The best acting in the movie, though is provided by Heath Ledger, an actor whom I thought just another one of the bunch of Freddie Prinze, etc., but who in fact is a great new talent, with a powerful yet short participation.
""Monster's ball"" would have to be eight hours long to discuss correctly all the subjects in it... It is not a bad movie, not at all, but the ending is too close to a fairy tail, if compared to the rest of the story.

1678304,4,B00005YU1M,"Lions Gate Films, which gave us very original films like Vincent Gallo's ""Buffallo 66,"" again offers a stunning independent film.  Before you watch this, prepare for the following facts: 1) it is a romance, but a kind of romance that may shock some of us.  There's nudity and an intense love scene.  2) The script is apparently not so great, but the director Marc Forster uses it as a backdrop to tell the story very silently.  Some may call it boring, but I just don't share that view.  Here's the reason.
Because the overall feeling of the film resembles that of European films, giving minute details to show the inner feelings of the complicated characters.  Look at how Billy Bob washes and cleans one thing which brought a terrible result.  Or, how he orders a cup of coffee at a diner.  Those small descriptions add up to the realistic portraits of the two leads, and in spite of the obvious flaws of the script, those details, if noticed, would slowly draw the viewers into the world of the film, which, set in Georgia, USA, goes on as if respectfully detached from the two leads.  But that European storytelling doesn't come as a big surprise at all because the director is born in Switzerland.
As many reviewers justly complain, the plot is far-fetched, to be sure.  Billy Bob Thornton's character Hank, being respected while working at a prison as an officier, is a politically uncorrect guy, but not as much as his father.  Hank's son Sonny (Heath Ledger), more liberal-minded, so to speak, also works at the same place, but at the execution scene of a convict (Sean Combs), this son greatly disappoints the conservative Hank.
Then, next morning, follows a string of tragedies (very violent, I warn).  But he is not the only one who suffers.  He later happens to get acquainted with Afro-American widow Leticia (Halle Berry) working at a diner, who had experienced (perhaps) more horrible things recently.  Out of their mutual compassion comes unexpected love, but is there any possibility that this most unlikely pair would get along with each other?
Don't expect any definite answers to the issues about races or capital penalty here.  This is basicaly a love story, and should be seen as that.  And the film avoids using many dialogues intentionally -- this is a wise decision for, as you see, there are some coincidences that stretch the credibility of the story.  The director only uses the script as a springboard for actors to be the characters, but nothing more.
As a result, two elements greatly help the film deliver: one is of course the acting.  Billy Bob is excellent; he is a kind of actor who can convey the character's any kind of emotions without saying anything, and he does it again.  Halle Berry is superb, completely leaving behind the rather humiliating role in ""Swordfish.""  Heath Ledger is also good, but sorry, his fans, his screen time is shorter than you might expect.  (Wes Bentley, his co-star in ""Four Feathers"" was originally supposed to be in Sonny's role, but he bailed out because of the fatigue coming during the filming.)
Please remember, this is not an easy ride; when it is depressing, it is unflinchingly, ruthlessly depressing, but they have made a point.  As the story unfolds, the film slowly gets calmer, showing the tender side of those characters living in turmoil.  Watch it like you watch the films like ""Slingblade.""

As for the rest, it's got all of the features I've come to expect and want, without the senseless filler.  Deleted scenes, alternate scenes, trailers, mini-documentaries, and commentaries. While I'm usually bored by director commentaries, I'm a sucker for commentary by actors, and this one takes the cake. Billy Bob is a cut-up, and he makes listening to this track worth the time.  If you're into a downer of a film, pick up this disc.",1031702400,,882,4.7631578947368425
1678329,5,B00005YU1M,"Much has already be said about the movie storyline, so I won't go into those details. This is a very moving reality-bites kind of movie that will live in you long after you've watched it. Breaking out of the traditional climatic-end continuous storyline moviemaking trend, this one takes the viewer into a journey of the mind -- you'll force yourself to predict what will happen next, or what the characters should do but never reach a foolproof 'conclusion'. The story borders on the dilemma of Leticia, a single mother whose husband has been electrocuted by the Corrections Department. The story turns and twists and Halle Berry (Leticia) ends up getting into an affair with the same corrections officer who oversaw her husband's execution. There are plentiful twists in the tale to summarise here, but as a viewer of many foriegn films and offbeat movies, this one is definitely a welcoming relief from the normal-everyday Hollywood movies. And, btw, those who kept focussing on Halle Berry being 'naked' in the film,... yes, those scenes are quite graphic by everyday standards, but there is way more to the film than just those parts. They simply complement the main theme, and makes it more poignant. As I watched the movie, I tried making decisions for the charcaters -- like the scence where Hank (Thronton -- the corrections officer) drives past Halle Berry and her son, lying on the side of the road on a stormy night ... . He can hear Leticia screaming out for help, but his mind is split into dilemmas that he himself cannot overcome -- on one hand his father had told him, ...""stay away from niggers"", and yes, he didn't like blacks himself, but then again, with the recent loss of his son who killed himself unable to bear his father (Hank's) insensitive nature, makes him ponder. He stops the car, and backs up,... for some reason he feels he should help this black lady and her child,... . The rain pouring outside, Hank in the car - stuck in this psychotic debate , Leticia outside crying for help. Definitely worth the watch, go for it, and if you are a serious movie critic, you'll want to see it over again -- after a long time, I finally got to see a Hollywood production of the Leaving Las vegas/Seven/... kind of unusual yet mindblowing proportions.

1678330,5,B00005YU1M,"Hail Halle!  Not only does she continue to redefine beauty, she redefines acting in her portrayal of a woman at a crossroads.
While the film focuses mostly on one man's struggle with the life assigned him and his relationship with his father and son, Halle's character, Leticia, must deal with her own heartache.  She finds herself redefining who she after a two significant losses in her life.
When life deals her a very heavy blow she turns to a man who was kind to her and an intense relationship begins.  While the editorial review speaks of the loss of children - it is how those deaths happen that bring about the bond.  It's an exquisitely written film, expertly directed, and beautifully acted by all!  Heath Ledger (one of my favorites) turns in a great performance (while I loved him in A Knights Tale, I didn't think he had it in him and now I am hooked!...) as Hank's son and the dynamic intensity between them leaves you bewildered and angry too.
This is a movie well worth watching.  If you are Billy Bob Thorton fan - you will not be disappointed.  If you are a Halle Berry fan -  you will be stunned to see the depth with which she potray's such loss and pain.  I knew she had it in her!

  Of far more interest than this movie is the sycophancy that inevitably attends ""provocative, interracial themes"".  The media's obsession with forcing this issue borders on the pathological.  I was duped into thinking this movie might be something different, but it's not.  It's OK, just don't believe all the hype.",1030924800,8,567,5.186813186813187
1678332,5,B00005YU1M,"I felt more like a voyeur than a viewer as I watched this film pry open the closed doors of its characters' lives and expose to the light of day each of their uniquely disturbing dysfunctionalities. One of the things that made much of this film so compelling to me personally was that, having grown up in a small southern town, I felt as though, like them or not, I knew a lot of these people.
I think Monster's Ball hits the target with its portrayal of its southern, white, working-class male characters. For starters, the interior of Hank's home, with the deer antlers, gun cabinet, faux-leather recliners, dark walls and medical oxygen tanks, is not a sterotype, folks, it's the real thing. But the descending degrees of racism displayed by each generation of Hank's family are even more photographic. Buck is an unreconstructed bigot of the old school - his encounter with Leticia is one of the film's most powerful moments. Sonny, on the other hand, has moved beyond all that and mixes freely with blacks, which contributes much to his ""weakness"". It is Hank's racism that is complex, for he is clearly caught in the middle between the attitudes of his father's generation and his son's. Hank is a racist because he thinks he is supposed to be, yet it his very lack of racist conviction that allows his heart to unharden, thus making the rest of the story altogether possible. Yet another ugly (but all too frequently realistic) aspect to the character of these men is their undiguised contempt for women. Consider the terms in how both Hank and Buck describe their former wives, the mothers of their children. Even more revealing is the manner in which both Hank and Sonny have sex with Vera, the prostitute. Like father, like son; this was one attitude Sonny was not able to transcend.
An unfortunate contrast to the strength of the film's study of its white characters is the weakness in its development of black characters. For one thing, there are simply not enough black characters in this story to balance the plot the way it probably should have been. Similarly, the undercurrents of apathy and despair that govern the lives of the impovershed, and the anger and mistrust these people would feel towards white males (particularly those employed by the local criminal justice system) are hardly addressed at all.
Is Monster's Ball how the small-town south really looks and feels? Not quite, but it comes painfully close at times. Is it, in the end, a ""feel-good"" love story? Hardly, as the ending leaves Hank and Leticia together, but with much more pain ahead of them to work out if their relationship is to last. Monster's Ball is, however, one of the best-acted films made in recent years. Thornton should also have received an Oscar for his work here. His performance was, at the least, as good as Berry's. If your idea of a good movie is one packed with fast-paced action and special effects, then pass on Monster's Ball - you'll hate it, as a lot of reviewers here apparently do. But if you tend to go for taut, gritty human drama brought to life by a deep script and incredibly powerful acting, then you won't want to miss this one.",1030924800,3,3152,4.701627486437613

wife of the man at whose execution he assisted.
So much could have been done with this story.  A deeper look at capital punishment, a deeper look at race relations.  Instead these subjects only get treated superficially at best.  This is a feel-good story (not necessarily a bad thing) but compare the treatment of the subject of capital punishment in this movie with the one in ""Dancer in the Dark"" and you realize how anemic ""Monster's Ball"" is.
Billy Bob Thornton puts in a solid performance, but I am sad to say that Halle Berry's performance was mixed, at times good, other times overacted and forced. I have to admit that her performance was just as good or better than the actresses who usually get the Oscar...but then again, the Academy often makes poor choices for these awards (no way Tom Hanks should ever get an Oscar).  Naomi Watts of ""Mulholland Drive"" should have gotten the award but, as usual, the best films and actors don't get recognized at the Oscars.
Awarding an Oscar to Halle Berry is just a cosmetic approach to the racism in Hollywood.  The way to correct the problem is to give better roles to deserving minority actors and actresses.
I am in no way a proponent of having sex and violence taken out of movies, however, this movie used the sex scenes gratuitously, obviously trying to appeal to voyeurs who get off on seeing a black female and a white male engaging in intercourse.

1678358,5,B00005YU1M,"The success of this film provides even more evidence of the vibrancy and vitality of independent filmmakers in the face of the stultifying vapidity of current mainstream efforts. Made for a paltry 4 or 5 million dollars, the movie shines with rare performances and heart-wrenching emotional situations too often avoided in the more demographically correct films produced by Hollywood insiders. Seems like all the best work has most recently been done outside official movie-making channels.
As with other recent independent films, the cast in this film is both star-studded and superb. From Peter Boyle to Billy Bob Thornton to Halle Berry, not a bad word can be uttered. All of their performances are outstanding, and the film develops into an incredible tour-de-force for Berry as she gives us a veritable busman's tour of a whole panoply of human passions and emotions, ranging from oozing and undulating sexuality on the one extreme to abject despondency on the other. This is a role virtually guaranteed to showcase her acting abilities, as it certainly did. Her raw talent to emote and take the camera hostage to her incredible acting powers is breathtaking to observe, and she shows us the stuff that won her the Oscar hands down.
The subject matter makes this film more appropriate for more mature viewers, as it is a bit too real and too candid about more adult mattes to be bandied about with younger viewers. Moreover, its rather cynical and depressing look at the more serious side of life makes it a must see film, one that shows us the treasure we now have in actors like Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton.

Death, hatred, and redemption all play major parts in this movie, especially redemption. This is about two people trying to cope with all the loss in their life, and turning to each others friendship. I will admit, I did not care for the sex scenes.

1678362,3,B00005YU1M,"I saw this movie after hearing very strong, very mixed reactions to it in the (non-white) media, and among my friends. After seeing the academy awards, I wanted to see it for myself. I came away feeling this this was a very powerful, gritty, realistically visceral movie, with stellar performances from both Thornton and Berry. But was it realistic? Was it truly about racism, poverty, inter-racial relationships, love and lust and renewal? Well, it was about these things in the same way ""The Dear Hunter"" was about the Vietnam War, meaning not at all. These things were in the fabric of the story, but I came away feeling that this story was really much smaller. It was about destruction, despair, connection, and hope for the future. This was a dark, grim movie, which ultimately left you feeling uplifted, if you were prepared to look beyond its flaws. If Thornton and Berry could find love and connection, maybe there's hope for the rest of us after all.
Thinking about this, I added one star to my (low) rating for this film. This was a good film, and it worked on many levels. But it was just too easy to portray Halle Berry, as a woman of color, as needing sex to ""feel good"". This is just not real, and it doesn't ring true, and it's far too common in film that the woman of color becomes the foil for the white man's desire. This could have been a much richer, more subtle, more equitable film. But in the end it was a small story. Well done, with flaws, with powerful performances, but still a small story.",1029369600,3,1517,4.52
1678363,5,B00005YU1M,"As I watched this film, I thought, ""I've been in more than a few neighborhoods like this. Is this what goes on out of earshot of outsiders?"" Well, yes and no. This film represents a rare work of moviemaking in my opinion. It isn't afraid to dwell in the gray areas of life where right and wrong aren't always clearly demarcated. If you like films that stimulate your mind to consider what is possible if not probable, then this film is for you. I'd have to say after two viewings that it is one of the best films I've ever seen. Disregard the reviewers who ridicule the film for its supposed lack of believability. This film requires audiences to transcend their own preconceptions, not suspend their disbelief. Messages abound that are both subtle and raw--a difficult balancing act which succeeds here because of superb camera work, excellent editing and visionary directing. As for the acting, this film has no weak links. I suppose I'll never regard Peter Doyle in quite the same way again when I watch Everybody Loves Raymond. In this film, he shows his true range and convinced me that he was an intractable bigot. Racial tension lacking? Apparently a few reviewers forgot the scene of Leticia's unexpected encounter with Buck. The tension in that scene is palpable. As for Berry, she demonstrates that her range of acting repertoire has yet to be fully tapped. Those critics who have focused on her lovemaking and sensuality have overlooked a lot of this film, perhaps to satisfy their preconceived and patronizing notions about her. The same can be said for Thornton. It's amazing, by the way, how he can play a nutcase, demonstrative auto mechanic in U-Turn and an intelligent but emotionally damaged prison officer in this film.
Occasionally, a liberal mindset creeps into this film, but the director doesn't preach, as many reviewers have noted. For example, Lawrence Musgrave is seemingly contrite and reflective in the last moments of his life, almost making us believe he is rehabilitated. But by his own admission he is a bad man, and one which he doesn't want his son to emulate. Those who are against the death penalty would do well to remember that we don't ever find out the nature of his crime nor would it have been any easier on his family if he lived (after all, Leticia has been visiting him for eleven years--nearly as long as their son has been alive--and she has grown tired of the pilgrimage). How can it be any better for her son to know that Daddy will never receive parole?
The ending makes it clear that many problems still need to be worked out between the main characters. It is by no means a done deal and Leticia's troubled glances at the tombstones and Hank's face should have been enough to make that clear. For every racist, however, that can't forget or tolerate them, we have to believe there are many others in the community who can forgive and forget (e.g. witness the black mechanic next door). So despite its mood of sorrow, disappointment, and cyclic abuse,this film succeeds in offering a hopeful way out. If you take this film on its own terms, discarding your preconceptions at the door and leaving yourself open to the power of personal redemption, this film can be not only provocative but cathartic.",1029369600,3,3251,4.745583038869258

1678366,3,B00005YU1M,"The first third of this film is the best, as it shows in relentless, harrowing detail how the execution of a condemned black man (Sean ""Puffy"" Combs) rips apart the lives, first, of his struggling wife and son (Halle Berry and Coronji Calhoun), second, of the father and son correctional officers (Billy Bob Thornton and Heath Ledger) assigned to the prisoner. In the aftermath, Ledger commits suicide, Calhoun is killed in a hit-and-run, and Thornton and Berry, both having lost their children, find themselves drawn together by shared catastrophe, two wounded souls clinging to each other. It's a tidy formula and one would like it to work. Berry has the flashier role and makes the most of it, earning her Oscar, despite the fact that her physical beauty takes away from her credibility as a downtrodden single mother. Thornton, though, has the more difficult job of convincing the viewer that a rigid, unfeeling white man whose emotional abuse drives his son to suicide is capable of evolving into a tender, compassionate protector of his former prisoner's widow. It's a measure of the actor's skill that he almost pulls it off.
In the end, however, the film is undone by a script too full of unlikely coincidences, gratuitously prolonged sex scenes and a seriously flawed premise. The idea that a poor, struggling African-American woman would latch on to a white man as her savior--beg him to ""make her feel good""--leaves a bad taste in the mouth which not all of the actors' and producers' skill can quite cover.",1029110400,10,1518,4.910505836575876

Look at the poor reviews for that. It is not the kind of movie that you can watch again, or even have an easy, good time watching it for the first time. It is not an enjoyable, entertaining experience. It is not supposed to be. Some people just don't get that. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Hank, a corrections officer down south. He has a strained relationship with his son Sonny(Heath Ledger), and a crothety old father(Wonderfully done by Peter Boyle). When we meet Hank, he is getting ready to put to death a man(Sean Combs AKA P.Diddy). We soon learn that Hank and his father are racist people. The elder one being even nastier. In comes Leticia Musgrove(Hallee Berry), the widow of the just executed man. She has a son and is struggling to make ends meet. Thru an accident that happens, she winds up meeting Hank. Before long, her and Hank strike up an unlikely friendship. ...Hank begins having a change of heart(which is a little far fetched that it happened so quickly and easily). This new union is likely to have trouble in it's future, and it does, in the form of Hank's father. The movie is directed very well. It gets the mood and the town right. It feels bleak and depressing, like the lives of our characters. Then there are the actors. Billy Bob is always good. Always real. He is one of the best we got working today. He makes interesting choices. He always makes them believeable. Hank is no exception. Wonderfully played. Hallee is a woman who won the Oscar and was deserving of it. There have been some not so nice comments about that. Whatever. She did a remarkable job. She made Leticia a human being. When she was down on her luck and depressed, we felt it. We saw it. It was real. She was great. Her winning the Oscar just being about politics is a bunch of bull. ...  Now, I can say that she is a wonderful, competent actress. Peter Boyle is very effective. Never before have you seen Peter Boyle like this. This will make you look at him on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" very differently. Extremely good. Heath Ledger has a rather small role, but he does the best with what he's got. Too bad he didn't have more. Sean Combs is not P. Diddy here. He does a good, respectful job here. He has a shot at a film career if he wants one. The sex scene is graphic and raw. It's off-putting. It's the most real and raw sex scene I've ever seen(and there haven't been many)this side of an X rating. It didn't alter my opinion on Hallee one bit. When you've lost everything and your in a dead zone, who knows what you would do. You know?. This movie is based on a tough subject matter. It's not for everyone and it isn't easy to watch. It shouldn't be judged by your thoughts on Hallee, the Oscar win, or the plot of the movie. It's a well written, directed, and acted movie, and it deserves to be seen as such. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. I am not quite sure what happened there. It could've been better.

I needn't go into the story as other reviews will spell it out for you.  I'll merely tell you what I thought.  There were some powerful emotional moments in this film, namely Sonny's (Heath Ledger) moment of truth and Leticia (Berry) having a breakdown at the hospital. Other than that, I find the resolution of the movie way too easy.  Am I to believe that Frank (Billy Bob Thornton) completely reverses his racist views after meeting one person?  Well, I suppose it could happen, but most changes that dramatic are not overnight I'm afraid to say.  The sex scenes were provocative, but I think that might have been just more capitalization on Halle's body. The gratuitous nudity was unnecessary. I got the point early on.
And the ending?  I think there might have been more conflict there, but it's kind of left unexplored.  I thought, ""That's it?""
I did think that ""Monster's Ball"" had potential to be a better movie, but the performances were pretty good and the intense scenes made it watchable.

The performances of Billy Bob Thornton and Hallie Berry are beyond Oscar quality.  The supporting actors, particularly Peter Boyle and Heath Ledger, make every moment of their limited roles count.  The script is restrained, allowing the story to develop at a leisurely pace without the histrionics that accompanied, say, From Hell.  The humanity of it all!  How often we make decisions without really making them.  Hank's father was a prison guard; Hank is a prison guard; Sonny is a prison guard.  Rings my bell.  I'm ordering a copy tonight.  By the way, the ending is slam-bang on target.  I won't spoil it for you by giving it away.  Let's just say that the inevitable happens and Leticia makes her decision.  Or does she?

Just because she is in a race related drama, breaks down when her son dies, and has at least a 5 minute soft-core porn scene with Billy Bob doesn't make the role deserving of best actress.  Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom) and Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge) were both more deserving.  Overall, I don't think the movie served a point.  I have seen plenty of race-related dramas -- this one taught me nothing I didn't know already.

1678419,5,B00005YU1M,"Independent filmmaking is alive and well and evident in Monster's Ball.  This film had a minuscule $4 million budget, a terrific script and a director not afraid to take some risks.  Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry practically donated their time they were paid so little.  The result is a powerful and disturbing film that walked off with a boatload of awards, not the least of which was a best actress Oscar for Berry.
Director Marc Forster conjures a forceful presentation with stark sets, next to nothing in the way of props and other set decoration, and a non existent soundtrack.  Forster does it with innovative use of the camera, sharp editing and most importantly excellent actor direction.  Forster could have done better at character development and the ending is nebulous and unsatisfying, but these shortcomings can be partially forgiven for the films many assets.
This is an actors' showcase, with outstanding performances all around.  Heath Ledger makes a short but intense appearance as the son that Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) despises.  Ledger pumps the character full of repressed anger and disappointment, simultaneously resenting him and seeking his father's approval.  Peter Boyle is despicable as Hank's bigoted and self centered father.  Billy Bob Thornton delivers his best performance since ""Sling Blade"" with a complex character torn between his prejudices and his attraction to Leticia (Halle Berry).
Of course the big story here is Halle Berry.  Berry shows once again that she is not just another pretty face.  I first took serious notice of her after seeing her performance in ""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"", a little seen TV movie in which she won both a Golden Globe and an Emmy.  After that marvelous dramatic performance, I was surprised that she couldn't land roles any better than ""Swordfish"" and ""X-Men"", which tapped nothing more substantial than her looks.
In this film, Berry is sexy and alluring, but these are only incidental attributes.  She displays a full range of emotions from vibrant elation and unbridled passion, to utter despondency.  She practically rips her heart out and throws it at the camera.  She can convey volumes with a single look, or come completely unglued with equal impact.  Her Oscar for this performance was richly deserved and had nothing to do with her race as so many have rationalized.  She just flat out won it going away.  As good as Nicole Kidman was in ""Moulin Rouge"", it wasn't even close.
This is an excellent film that is worth seeing for the acting alone.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a compelling and deeply disturbing drama that serious film lovers will surely enjoy.",1027728000,9,2649,5.018306636155606
1678420,5,B00005YU1M,"Yes i gave it 5 stars but i really didn't like the whole movie.  The first part waiting for the execution of Halie Berry's husband was just way to tense to be entertaining. It was like the director wanted everyone in the audience to experience ""waiting"" to die or something. I thought it was stressful to watch. Now for Halie Berry herself.  She gave a wonderful and renching performance of a struggling black mother who has an overweight child who loves candy bars. She really deserved the award for Best Actress.  As you know i don't treat movie actors all that kindly but in Berry's defense she gave one-hell of a performance.  Now here is the ""But"",,,,,With all her beauty and all her extreme wonderful talent was it really necessary for her to expose so much of her body?  Were the sex scenes really needed to be filmed with Billy Bob and Halle?  I'm not a prude and i have had my share of porn movies, But why did she have to lower herself into doing this in front of a camera.  She has proved herself over and over again in films that she is turly a talented actress.  To me it just cheapend her and the film.  I realize that todays ""Hollywood"" goes into shock value to the audience because most actors can't make it on acting alone and need either special effects or sex to help sell tickets. All in all i give this film a very high mark.  Just be prepared to get a little stressed out while watching it. It's no light-hearted comedy that's for sure.",1027555200,,1458,4.366666666666666

1678422,2,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball is a very intense movie. It garnished Hallie Berry with her Academy Award and I must admit she did a fantastic job, however this movie is not something I would see again. The performances are good and even Peter Boyle is a standout. Hallie tries hard and performs very well.
Billy Bob Thorton is also a deep performer in this piece. Coupled with a really weird town and a really backwards thinking community - this movie shows the harsh realities of prejudice, love, hate and rivalry among a father who doesn't love his son and a son who loves his father.
I wouldn't recommend this for the faint of heart and it has a real depressing theme - even Hallie's own child gets a strange twist. Overall the DVD doesn't have a lot of extra features but it does have few trailers of some better films. I was disappointed in this and wasn't quite expecting what I saw. I rented it because this is not a film I would buy.",1027468800,,925,4.383720930232558
1678423,5,B00005YU1M,"First and foremost, I just want to say that Halle Berry deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role.  Even though the film picked up an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, the film should have had more recognition as far as Academy Awards.
There are several elements about this film that needs to be brought to attention, but I wouldn't have enough room to mention all of them on this particular review.
I have heard numerous people protest that this film is stupid,  that it's a waste of time, it's not worth watching, that it makes absolutely no sense, or that it is a total disappointment. - - NOT TRUE - -
Some people will take another person's opinion into perspective and then accept it for granted. - - DON'T - - (at least not in this case)  Give this movie a chance.  It deserves every chance it can take.  This motion picture is proficient and it will forever in my mind remain everlasting and unforgettable.
What I like best about this film is the mood changes.  Mood drastically changes as it is rolling from from beginning to end.  Now you know what they say, that it is caused by the character's overall emotions.  Yes that is true, but in this case, only partially.  The change of mood is also caused by the events that make up the plot created by the characters, the environment of the film, and, of course, the film's scoring (music).  Asche and Spencer did an outstanding, superb, and compelling job with writing, creating, and composing the music to this film.  If it hadn't have been for the music, I don't think my mind would have set so highly and clear on the movie as it did.
Don't get me wrong, as I said before, every aspect of this film is wonderful.  However, if one aspect of the film is crossed out, such as the performances, it can cost the film's grasp of emotion and the film could not be as magnificent as it was or it might even be ruined.  Remember that!!!!
This film may contain many adult issues, but you cannot let that statement cancel out the film as a whole.  It stands out to its potential.
Finally, you can't forget the remarkable performances created by Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger, Sean Combs, and especially Peter Boyle.  Their performances, along with Halle Berry and the rest of the cast ties in together to create a story about what it is like to be depressed, frustrated, cared, sensitive, and above all loved.
This motion picture deserves all of the recognition it can get.  Most of that can come from you, viewers.  It's everything I could ask for, and it could be everything you would ask for.
Watch it today!!",1027382400,2,2595,4.510683760683761
1678424,2,B00005YU1M,"Ok, let me start with the fact that I felt let down a bit because of all the hype.  And if Halle Berry deserved an oscar than so did Billy Bob Thorton.
Billy Bob plays a racist, ... parent and prison guard who learned his ideals form his racist, ... father.  He sees the light and runs into Halle and forms an attachment to her.  The rest, so they say, is history.  While Halle's performance is very good I feel that Billy Bob's was more of a progressive character study through changes and issues.
And the ending left something unresolved (in my opinion).  The hype was worth more than the movie.  It drug a little but was a good character study if you could stand the pace.",1027296000,3,675,4.275590551181103

1678437,5,B00005YU1M,"One of the best pictures of 2001 is MONSTER'S BALL.  It is no surprise that Halle Berry won an Oscar for her role as Leticia, an African-American wife who has to cope with the loss of her son just as she has to learn to cope with the problems involved in having a white lover, played by Billy Bob Thornton.  This film is noteworthy for more than just the extraordinary acting of its cast, but for its subtext that suggests that as society changes, some people manage to change with it and stay afloat, while others cannot or will not, and pay a fearsome price.
  Director Marc Forster sets the stage in a Southern prison with the upcoming execution of a convict played by Sean Combs, who in his brief role manages to invest his character with a myriad of conflicting emotions, most of which revolve around his wife, an uncaring Leticia, and an overweight son who cares enough for both himself and his mother.  She no longer has any feeling for her husband and blames his long criminal career as the reason.  All she cares about is giving her son the opportunity to say goodbye to his father.  The scenes between the condemned and the prison guards responsible for making sure the execution goes off without a hitch are played with an undercurrent of inevitability.  Each recognizes that they all have a role to play in a script that was written when the governor turned down Combs' last minute stay of execution. Heath Ledger plays Hank's son who dares to alter the script slightly by vomiting in horror at his own role.  It was painful for the audience to see how callously Hank beats his son, thus identifying him as surely the villain.  But in this movie, not all monsters wear horns or are incapable of change.  Heath Ledger cannot change nor can he reconcile his feelings of rage at the system with rage at a father who so clearly supports a life-denying system.  In despondency, he shoots himself.  Hank, who admits that he once hated his son, now begins to change.  At home, his father, well-played by Peter Boyle, represents the dying view of the South as the last bastion of resistance against civil rights and uppity nigras.  His venom, upon seeing that his son is involved with a black woman, is brutally cutting, more so because his remarks do not represent a thoughtful insult but merely the tip of a prejudiced iceberg whose icy base extends all the way to Reconstruction.  He,like his son, cannot change, and his punishment is to be exiled to a nursing home.  Leticia is first seen as a mean woman whose rage at a criminal husband extends to an obese son who eats more the more she hits him for being obese.  When her son is killed in a hit and run, her grief is real, even if she expresses it first by laughing, then crying, then laughing again.  She and Hank connect, with each one suffering greatly, but in Hank's case, his pain is internalized.  It is only by the mildest change of voice tone does he suggest that his calm face hides a heart that is at least as devastated as Leticia's.  They begin an affair that starts out as pure sex.  It is only after several graphic couplings that expose Halle Berry's nude body, does she begin to see that pain comes and goes, but it is trust that must endure.  Leticia must endure the overt racism of Hank's father and the unexpected discovery of Hank's participation in her husband's execution before she realizes that the many monsters that lurk in everyone's soul are put there by that person, and that with love, with courage, and with effort, they can be removed too.",1026777600,16,3532,4.5362776025236595
1678438,2,B00005YU1M,I thought the  movie was going to be something fantastic since Halle had won an award for it.  But it was a big disappointment and the sex scene that I had heard so much about was not great. Everyone in the movie in my opinion did poor acting.  And the ending was .........  there are not enough words to describe what a disappointment this movie was!,1026777600,3,351,4.2727272727272725
1678439,5,B00005YU1M,"Starring Billy Bob Thornton as Hank and Halle Berry as Leticia, this is the story is about a racist corrections officer who falls in love with the African-American widow of a man in whose execution he participated. Including the condemned man, played by Puffy Combs, three people die, and the shock of their deaths catapult the characters into a situation where chance and desperate need bring these two people together.  The film is hard to watch, especially because of the unflinching racism, words hurled in anger and rage which I, in my protected New York lifestyle, have never heard spoken aloud. And yet, none of these very flawed human beings come across as stereotypes.
Billy Bob Thornton is one of the finest actors in the film world today, and his performance is nothing short of outstanding.  We hate him for his racist beliefs and yet we see a gradual humanity creep in, as he respects the last wishes of the condemned man and is infuriated by his own son, also a corrections officer, who shows weakness during the execution.  Peter Boyle is cast as Hank's father, his racism becoming stronger as he is aging and his health failing.  Throughout, he's unrepentant and represents the old and cruel way of the South.  Heath Ledger is cast as Sonny, Hank's son, a young man who is being pushed too hard to accept his father's lifestyle.  And Halle Berry, is not only pretty, but has the ability to show  complex emotion with just her eyes.  Every scene she's in is real and poignant, especially the scenes she has with her overweight son, Tyrell, played by Coronji Calhoun who is excellent in his first film role.  Together, the actors create a real and troubled world and I must say that this is one of the best casting jobs I have ever seen.
Directed by a young Swiss director, Mark Forster, the original screenplay was written by Milo Addica and Will Rokos.  With less talented people, there could have been too much melodrama, but the story is told with dignity and restraint in spite of its outrageous theme. Every line of dialogue rings true.  And the cinematography of the working-class Georgia town puts the viewer right there. Wonderful in every way.  It rates my highest recommendation.",1026432000,32,2204,4.755905511811024
1678440,4,B00005YU1M,"The nature of this movie was very disturbing, but, the people in this movie comes alive in their respective roles - principally, Halle Berry.  She definitely played the role of a lifetime.  I'm sure she pulled from her reserve of emotional disappointments over her lifetime to come up with the range of emotions she had to use for all of the scenes in this film.  I also enjoyed Billy Bob Thornton's role as he came to realize who he was, and to change that, and become someone else - someone of light, and not dark.
I highly recommend this DVD for the intelligent movie watcher.",1026432000,5,579,4.495238095238095
1678441,4,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball is a wonderful but somewhat morbid film.  From the beginning I couldn't help saying, how could these peoples lives get any worse.  Of course, all their lives do get worse as it goes along.  A beautifully done tragedy that ends with a lot of hope for two people who's lives were basically wrenched apart at the core.  A little heavy on the gratuitous sex scenes, especially with ""Vera"" making house calls, but it sells.  Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry both did a wonderful job on this movie and both deserved all the accolades they've received for it.",1026345600,4,569,4.65
1678442,4,B00005YU1M,"There are many things to like in this movie:
The masterful direction.
The fine performances - Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton hit all the right notes as the leading couple. Furthermore, we meet Heath Ledger in a part completely different from the pretty-boy-roles of his past, while Peter Boyle (whose I've always been a fan) depicts successfully Thornton's racist father.
The raw, realistic and intense atmosphere of the film is also a big plus - The love scene, for which many things have been written, is a perfect example of that atmosphere.
What could have probably been better:
The story, describing how the tragic occurrences in the lives of two people will finally bring them together, didn't always convince me. For example, how did Thornton's character so abruptly change from a black men's hater to someone capable of loving so passionately a black woman? There are a couple of things, which I will not reveal, that attempt to explain this reversal, but still...
In any case, for me, the real peak of the movie comes at the closing scene. If you pay close attention to the look in the eyes of Halle Berry's character, everything will make perfect sense for you.",1026345600,6,1175,4.821782178217822
1678443,5,B00005YU1M,"I watched this movie rather reluctantly.  I expected it to be totally depressing and surprisingly it was not.  After seeing it, I couldn't get it out of my mind and keep mulling over so many of the subtle details.

For me, the beauty of this film was how stark and yet how subtle it seemed to be.  All the characters, even the minor ones, seemed so layered without being heavy handed.  The two main characters, Hank and Letitia, played by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry, are not necessarily likeable characters.  They are living lives of quiet desperation and somehow their lives come together through a series of circumstances.  Somehow Hank finds some joy and hope that he probably never remotely imagined existed and Letitia finds unexpected shelter from the relentless blows life has showered on her.  Together they are nicer people and more whole than apart.

I found personal beauty in so many tiny elements and how subtly Hank's racist attitude starts to change.  When Hank starts approaching the black neighbor whose kids he drove off his property with a shotgun, the neighbor doesn't rebuff him as he obviously could have which would have reinforced Hank's racist beliefs.

Halle Berry is obviously a gorgeous woman but I didn't feel her beauty detracted from this role.  It seemed like she was a woman who should have had a much better life (i.e., her physical beauty opening doors and opportunities) but like many people, bad choices and unfortunate circumstances over the years have taken their toll.

I highly recommend this film but warn that it is not necessarily a comfortable movie to watch.  At the end, I chose not to watch the deleted scenes (on the DVD) because I didn't want to change the impressions I had after my initial watching.",1026345600,7,1759,4.82
1678444,5,B00005YU1M,"I think Monster's Ball is one of the best movies I've seen because it so accurately depicts the racial issues that bring people together and the ones which divide them. I like Billy Bob Thornton's work, and he was at the top of his form in this movie. I also like Halle Berry's work; she was outstanding in Monster's Ball. Together as Hank and Leticia they portrayed their characters in realistic, believable detail. Hank is not a very sympathetic character in the beginning of the movie. He seems to be walking through the events in his life on auto-pilot, and there's not much room for emotional interaction in his character. Leticia seems to be getting through her life in much the same way as Hank, only Leticia is obviously holding it all together with more difficulty and with the additional help from cigarettes and the occasional drink. Where Hank's life is routine but settled insofar as his job and financial position is concerned, Leticia's life is cluttered with a number of serious problems like the execution of her husband, the probability of losing her house, a job change, and a number of other issues. She's doing the best she can with what she's got, but the strain is always present in her body language and in her face.
Hank and Leticia connect when they each suffer the loss of their sons. This one circumstance forms the basis for their growing attachment to each other. As the relationship progresses, Hank becomes less the automaton and a much more sympathetic character. Leticia loses some of that tension she carries around with her like second skin. It appears they've both found a new beginning in life which neither of them would have believed could happen. But, after all, the title of this movie is Monster's Ball; reality does intrude before everyone gets too comfortable in his or her better life.
It would be an oversimplification of the issues in Monster's Ball to let the explanation for the message in this film go at that. It is about racism and the implications of that mind set. It's about men and women, and how they perceive circumstances. And I think it's about who we are and the events which shape us into what we are. It is also about the interracial aspects of a relationship, and how that in itself affects not only the people in the relationship but those around them as well.

Halle Berry plays the role of convict's wife and bereaved mother without much gradation, and comes across as slightly hysterical throughout.

Little did I suspect though that he was hiding a talent with such range under that semi nerd appearance. In the last 12 months, I've seen him reinvent himself so many times that I couldn't tell you who Billy Bob Thornton really is (Bandits and The Man Who Wasn't There, to name two). And, boy, does he not shy away from a difficult, even potentially hateful role.

In this film, Thornton and his son (Heath Ledger) are the death row guards for Halle Berry's husband who is about to be executed. Far from that execution's being the main event of the movie, it serves to set off a chain reaction of events that show the two characters, played by Thornton and Berry, in depth as human beings with multi facets. Each of them has a son and each could be called a bad parent. Each has a scene with his/her respective son that will take you way past any comfort zone. Then, there's Thornton's relationship with his father, played by Peter Boyle, a truly despicable man.

With all these jagged edges, it is surprising that the movie is at heart a relationship movie about Thornton and Berry as a couple and not a film about death row or parents and sons. Berry is outstanding and certainly did an Oscar worthy performance. The only other film I've seen her in is ""Swordfish"". Many people might not even guess that this is the same actress. As for Thornton, he is that rarity, a triple or quadruple threat talent: he can act (comedy and drama equally), write (The Gift and Slingblade), direct, sing, drum. I guess the only question is, Can He Dance? If he can't, give him a few lessons and I'm sure we'll see him in a Fred Astaire remake next.

1678472,5,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball"" is the kind of film that very often doesn't get made. It characters are unlikable at first glance, it deals heavily with racism, death, and sex. It is a small miracle then that Marc Forster was able to deliver this very special motion picture to us.
Set in the urban wasteland of the modern south, ""Monster's Ball"" at first concerns itself with the lives of Hank, played by Billy Bob Thornton, and his son Sonny, played by Heath Ledger. Father and son both work as correction officers, often in charge of administering the death penalty. Both lead empty, joyless lives, largely as the result of their bigoted upbringings. ....
The acting in this film is glorious. Billy Bob Thornton creates in Hank a man who seems incapable of love, but is very vulnerable underneath his exterior of hatred. Halle Berry gives a raw and real performance as Leticia, daring to make the audience hate her. She is a bad mother and a failure, but she also has a deep well of love and a determination to survive. Heath Ledger gives a surprisingly layered performance as the hopeless Sonny. He is only on screen for a short time, but plays against type and makes Sonny a very haunted young man. Sean Combs also does well as Leticia's doomed husband, a man who has long since repented for his sins. Peter Boyle also strikes a nerve as the vulgar and bigoted father of Hank.
""Monster's Ball"" does not dwell on the consequences of an interracial relationship in the South. It is an intense, heartbreakingly beautiful film that tells the uncompromised and utterly real story of two very flawed and human people who have lost everything, but somehow manage to find comfort in each other's arms. Maybe that is the most important thing about ""Monster's Ball."" Hank and Leticia never declare their love for one another. They simply feel a comfort with each other, a bond that goes beyond love. When they are together, they hurt a little less. Leticia begs Hank to ""make me feel good.""
Hank and Leticia may never feel good, but at least they feel better. And they realize that maybe there is a future for them, after all.",1025049600,11,2106,4.663978494623656
1678473,4,B00005YU1M,"Monsters Ball is one of those movies you watch when it comes out, and you say to yourself ""well that was a great movie"". Then a week later you see it on cable and watch it again and think, didn't I already watch this? The performances are superb, but the story ends too abruptly. You're still wondering, well is that it? Come on! You look through the DVD extra features and beg for about a 20 minute extended ending. However, the movie will keep your attention, but its like someone with A.D.D, you seen it yet you forgot it. The storyline is based around Hank (Billy Bob Thorton) who has more or less a meaningless, dastardly job as the supervisor over the executions. After his son (Heath Ledger) messes up the last walk for a inmate on deathrow (Sean ""P-Diddy"" Combs) Hank angrily confronts him and the result ends in his son committing suicide right in front of him. The inmate who is put to death leaves his wife (Halle Berry) a widow with a young son. But after her son ends up a hit-and-run causing him to die. With that in mind Berry and Thorton start a ""common bond"" relationship which makes Thorton's dad (a racist S.O.B) angry. All leading to an enevitible ending. Halle Berry turns in an Oscar Winning performance. Dont miss it, but you won't remember it. Its too easily dismissed!",1025049600,2,1293,4.506382978723404
1678474,5,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball"" is about two people who are united through circumstance and tragedy.  Billy Bob Thornton plays Hank, a prison guard who has an adult son (an impressive Heath Ledger) and takes care of his boorish, redneck father.  Halle Berry is Leticia, a woman whose husband (a very good Sean Combs) is on death row, can't seem to hold down a job, and vents her frustrations on her obese young son.  Neither Hank nor Leticia is a very good parent, and they come from two entirely different backgrounds.  But on one rainy evening, they cross paths with each other, and from there a relationship begins.  However, what Leticia doesn't know is that Hank was one of the people who assisted her husband's execution.  And, as with almost all interracial relationships, tension rises between them, and Hank is forced to confront his racist demons.
This is a very upsetting movie, and the material deals with some very volatile issues.  But it soars on the strength of the performances.  The spotlight is clearly Halle's, who rightfully earned her Oscar.  An actress known for her beauty, she de-glamed herself in this gritty performance, and she pulled it off without faking a single move.  But props also has to go to Billy Bob Thornton, who gives a dynamite performance as well.  Following ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" Thornton is on a roll, and is becoming one of the finest actors in the last ten years.  And let's not forget rapper Mos Def, who makes a brief, but compelling appearance as Hank's neighbor.  ""Monster's Ball"" may be a tough movie to sit through, but it's easily one of the best films of 2001 and warrants a purchase.",1025049600,34,1630,4.73758865248227

1678495,5,B00005YU1M,"I have held my tongue (keyboard?) for a long time, but this is a comment for all of you who seem to think that all the movies with actual human characters rather than cardboard cutouts are ""sooo slooow"" and ""sooo looong"" and boring. GET an ATTENTION SPAN! I can't imagine anyone could find this film dull or slow. Yes, it is ""deliberately"" paced, for it is a story about change, and change does not happen quickly. Perhaps those who found it boring are so jaded by action movies and alienated from any real human feeling that they can't relate to the material. If any of you must give a film a negative review, please try to point out what was wrong with the theme, concept or execution (no pun intended). Otherwise just watch a couple hours of rock videos and spare the rest of us who like to see films with scenes longer than five or six frames each.

I find this to be an excellent film, very powerful. I have a high tollerance of powerful material (The Wild Bunch is my favorite film), but it was tough for me to get through the first 3/4 hour. In the end it all resolves (or doesn't) in a grace note so simple and beautiful that I was stunned.

lastly, I stated earlier that this was a film about change, but the change in the film is a small adjustment, not fundamental. Hank is not a racist character who falls in love with a Black Woman. It is clear from the first frame that he is not really a racist, or if he is, a halfhearted one. He has a stubborn streak of human decency that is there all along. He turns to Berry's character because he has a need for human contact that is as raw as hers, and she is there in front of him. What begins as animal sexual release becomes something else. Note his frightened, frenzied desparation when she peels out and drives away, it is only after he has come to care for her that he realises how dead he was inside. Hank doesn't really change. He merely begins to shed the uglier aspects of himself, because they pale in comparison to his need. Thornton is great as usual, and though I wish Naomi Watts had at least been nominated, Berry richly deserved her award.",1024963200,7,2111,4.301507537688442

I began to care about their lives and what would happen to them. The reformation of both Hank and Latecia could not have been accomplished in my opinion without them establishing an emotional bond. Their physical encounter restored their humanity and in the process their intimacy made them tender.  I could not believe the two people I saw at the end of the film were the same ones introduced to us at the beginning.  Kudos to Halle Berry for a brilliant performance, and to Billy Bob Thorton for making me a fan of his quiet intensity.",1024876800,3,673,4.630252100840337
1678497,5,B00005YU1M,"The performances are the showcase of director Marc Forster's acclaimed ""Monster's Ball"".  Billy Bob Thorton contributes a quiet, near-perfect performance as Hank, a grieving angry police officer living with his racist father (a fine Peter Boyle) and troubled son (Heath Ledger in an electrifying turn).  Halle Berry won an Oscar for her role as Leticia, the widow of a man (Sean Combs) executed on death row by Hank.  Through a series of tragic circumstances, the two come together and find they need each other.  ""Monster's Ball"" is stark, grim, and never very pleasant, but the beautiful acting and competent direction make for a worthwhile viewing.",1024876800,2,651,5.171428571428572
1678498,5,B00005YU1M,"WOW!
  I am surprised at everyone's review on this movie!  One person saying- ""I want my two hrs back!""
Did we watch the same movie?  The one with Billy Bob and Halle Barry? My God, this movie moved me off the couch and touched me with so many emotions, I am still talking about it to my friends.
Billy Bob is a corrections officer (mean, racist, relentless, did I say mean?)
Halle is the widow of (Puff Daddy) whom Billy Bob and others put in the electric chair.  She is without makeup (still stunningly gorgeous, a victim of the choices she has made, a welfare mom, a sort of loser you could say.
They somehow meet (Destiny)  The big, bad Billy and welfare mom, Halle.
 And it is
 ELECTRIC...
I can still feel the shock waves running through my veins, still feel my body and mind covered with goose bumps.
Halle did not win the academy award because she is black, she won it because she is damn, damn good.
One scene which moved me completely is... when Billy Bob asks her ""What can I do?  Tell me what to do.""  after her son dies.
She says...""Just make me feel good.  Make me feeeel goood.""  she wanted to feel anything other than what she was feeling.  Anything.  Sex.  Something.
Raw, yes.  But the tenderness overpowers the sex...  This is why the scene works.  The connection between the two is amazing.  Black and white becoming one.  And in the end REDEMDTION.
Forgiveness...Hope...and a Light glimmering through the darkness.",1024876800,2,1435,4.509727626459144
1678499,5,B00005YU1M,"When I first heard the basic plot of MONSTER'S BALL, I was very intrigued, but skeptical. Watching the movie, I dreaded throughout that the filmmaker's were going to play things out in an obvious and predictable way. How refreshing it was to discover that they didn't.
Instead, I saw a tight, economical script with an amazing performance by Halle Berry. Undoubtedly, people will nit-pick about Berry's work in the film, but beat by beat, her Leticia was one of the most physically and emotionally challenging roles of the year. For the most part, she was up to the task and clearly demonstrated that she's a serious actress. One can debate whether or not she deserved an Oscar for her work, but she definitely gave an Oscar calibre performance.
Billy Bob Thornton was also deserving of an Academy Award nomination (although he didn't receive one) for his complex role as Hank. He played it honestly and fearlessly.
Also of note was Mos Def's performance in the film. It was finely shaded and understated. He's definitely an actor to watch.
However, despite these and other fine performanes in the film (Peter Boyle is another example), what really impressed me about this film was its script. All too often, writers seem compelled to explain every detail about a character, so that the audience ""gets it."" Fortunately, with MONSTER'S BALL, the writers assume that the audience has some level of intelligence.
In this film, one gets more with just a look on a character's face than would be accomplished in ten pages of expositional dialog. The screenplay deservedly was nominated for both an Oscar as well as an Independent Spirit Award.
Another thing that was refreshing about this film was that it didn't shy away from its controversial subject matter. It deals with issues of class, race, sexuality and relationships with an honesty that most filmmakers shy away from today. This of course will not sit well with the easily offended or those that refuse to believe that racism still exists in America. Given the casting of Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton in the key roles, some may not accept that the characters they played could get together romantically. Like it or not, relationships like this can and do exist and will continue to do so. If you get anything out of the film, it should be that relationships in general are spontaneous, unpredictable and often defy logic.
Overall, MONSTER'S BALL is a challenging film that is often difficult to watch (and not always for the obvious reasons). If you're looking for a film that forces one to confront what we fear in ourselves, this one is it.",1024790400,42,2603,4.851685393258427

The title almost had nothing to do with the movie. There was no monsters or a ball I could find throughout the entire time.",1024790400,3,345,4.164179104477612
1678501,5,B00005YU1M,"I liked this.  I'm buying it.  I intend to use it for myself and for discussion with upperclassmen and grad students in lit courses.
The film is very good work--one of very few films in a long, long time to achieve a measure of realism and drop the condescension towards racial tension in the south.  While not completely free of stereotypes, the characters are much, much more believable. (How can you be more southern than Billy Bob Thornton?  Apparently, you just point the camera at him and tell him what to talk about and it works smashingly.) The theme of the film, highlighted by its lack of revenge or heartbreak in the end, is redemption.  Redeeming love, straight out of a baptist sunday school room. That's why Halle Berry suddenly realized everything but didn't go Fatal Attraction or Jackie Brown on him.  That would have been cliche', and it damned sure wouldn't have been redemptive.  That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it.
 Two minor gripes:  Billy Bob's transformation occurs a little too quickly and too easily.  A realistic change would have shown him  begrudgingly associating with Halle Berry's character for awhile longer, even after the first coupling.  Extreem reticence in tough southern males is a must-have for realism.
The other minor gripe is the featurette included on the home version of the film, the pseudo-genius trio of composers' explanation of how they were poetically inspired to respond to the story's arcs, etc.  That's horse puckey.
They were hired because they worked cheaply and could pull together a knock-off of what you were really hearing, the musical style of Daniel Lanois. Am I the only one who doesn't hear what amounts to virtually theft of a major producer/performer's repertoire?
What the movie's haunted by on the first level is the history of the American South and the always unspoken truth behind racial violence, which was sexual tension.  What it's haunted by in score and ambience is the spirit of Daniel Lanois, who should be looking in his mailbox for a paycheck for this stuff.
Billy Bob:  Don't stop making films about real Southerners.  We love it when you do that.",1024790400,3,2133,4.883333333333334
1678522,4,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball"" is one of the most searing American melodramas of recent years and is highlighted by dynamite performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry [Best Actress Oscar]. It is not so much a love story as it is the story of two emotionally overwhelmed people clinging to each other out of desperation. As such, it may hit a little too close to home for some people. It's improbable that a man and a woman in real life would experience the absurdly coincidental events these characters do, but the fact remains that many couples form a union from basic needs rather than from true love.
Hank [Thornton] is a state prison guard like his father [Peter Boyle] before him. One night he helps prepare a young man convicted of murder for execution. He doesn't think all that much about this. It's an unpleasant part of his job. What he can not know is that he will later become involved with the man's widow, Lucille [Berry]. This occurs soon after Hank's own life is shattered by a devastating tragedy in his own family. Meanwhile, Lucille's problems are about to take another dreadful turn. When the two finally turn to each other, it is out of loss, desperation and the absence of hope. They seek solace in each other's bodies. All the while, Hank's secret about his sad connection to Lucille's husband lurks in the background.
I don't play the game of who did or did not deserve an Oscar. [Many people felt that Sissy Spacek should have won for ""In the Bedroom"".] I will say that Ms. Berry's performance is remarkable and is a stunning revelation about her abilities as an actress. Despite some weakness in the script, she, along with director Marc Forster and the rest of a most gifted cast, give ""Monster's Ball"" a power and a tragic majesty that make it a must-see for lovers of great movie making.",1024704000,3,1811,4.627329192546584

I thought it was put together poorly while the acting was no better. If you have to see it, rent it, then you'll only be out 4 bucks.

Ol' Billy Bob lasts a bit longer); but Halle Berry gives her best performance to date (she truly deserved her Oscar), as does rapper Sean ""P.

1678527,5,B00005YU1M,"Having seen both this film (on DVD) and ""A Beautiful Mind"" (in the theatre), I'm perplexed at the disparity of honors that were given out on Oscar night. Halle Berry absolutely deserved her Oscar for her portrayal of Leticia Musgrove, the Death Row widow who enters into an unlikely relationship with Hank Grotowski, played by Billy Bob Thornton. This was not a ""political"" choice, i.e. because she happens to be black. Her character was a black woman, okay? I can't even remember the other actresses who were up for the Best Actress Award. Anyway, the Academy got that one right. But in truth, this film should have won Best Picture, Best Director (for Mark Forster) and probably best supporting actor, for Heath Ledger, even though his character dies early on in the film. But the subject matter of this film (black man is executed, widow falls in love with a white man) just wasn't ""appropriate"" enough to give it the high visibility of those other awards. Better give them to a superficial, ""unreal"" concoction that is ""A Beautiful Mind"", a feel-good movie if there ever was one. Don't get me wrong, I though Russell Crowe did an outstanding job in that film; but, ""Monster's Ball"" is about the hard truthes of life, death and love in an unequal society, told with unflinching realism. Sean Combs did an outstanding job (for a non-actor) as the condemned man, Leticia's husband, and his scenes leading up to the execution are some of the most powerful ones in the film.  As a native southerner, I actually thought that the racism was toned way down, and that is my only real criticism of the movie. Oh yes, and the commentary by the director and the principal actors on the DVD was a nice touch. Believe me folks, they wuz robbed.",1024272000,3,1734,4.685245901639345

I was a little suprised that the DVD was not supplemented with more extras considering that it received a noteworthy Academy Award (no bios, special commentaries, widescreen format, etc).  I was riveted by the story and most of the casts performances.  No one can dispute the fact that Halle Berry' s performance was exceptional, but she had a strong supporting cast to help her.  Billy Bob, Heath, and Peter Boyle were thoroughly convincing in their respective roles.  My only criticism of the film was that Halle's complexion always seemed to look fresh and dewy despite the fact that she was destitute, alcoholic, smoker.  Still when she had to perform, anyone watching could feel the emotion she was conveying.  I would highly recommend viewing this work if nothing else but to see what was required for an African American actress to finally break the color lines.  She had to be willing to show herself in the most unflattering way and let it be known that she knew her place for the Academy to feel that she was worthy of the highest distinction.",1024272000,3,1191,4.742718446601942
1678529,5,B00005YU1M,"OK, the movie is great!  I am writing this only to argue against the reviews some customers have had the gut to post.  The movie is listed under Drama and if you don't like drama, don't watch it!  If you are the typical American that watches movies only to sit down on the couch and relax while eating pop-corn, rent something else.
 Monsters Ball is intense and well directed.  The cinematography heightens its intensity and suspense.  The actors are great in their role, and there is a lot of symbolism that is thrown out there for you to catch . . . if you want.  Even the sex scene is much deeper than the average audience may think . . . Has anybody noticed the bird cage?  The violence they showed towards their kids is only a reaction of their oppression/depression . . . hence the bird in the cage.  During the shocking sex scene the director flashed images of her hands freeing the bird from the cage.  If your ears were open, you heard at the end of the same scene the characters tell each other how much they needed one another.  That moment is the beginning of their freedom and rest of their life together.  The two characters come from completely different backgrounds and yet have many commonalities.  They are meant to be and she realizes it before him.
If you put the pop-corn down you can also notice how the director portrays the drama that surrounds both characters, with the color red (symbol of passion, but also of blood and pain).  You can see random red objects in both lives/houses (i.e. a red lamp, red couch, red curtains, red gumball, red handkerchief, red blood stains on her white shirt and on his white hat).
As per the racist theme in the movie, it is a very current problem in this country and if you don't like it, open your eyes and take a trip down South . . . I am from Europe and my first trip to the US started in Tennessee where whites don't go to black public pools and vice versa.

In this sensitive, quietly shocking film, we the audience make up the Monster's Ball.  We sit in expensive theater seats and observe the deceptively complex lives of a small town in the South.  The time is now; the bigotries and wasted mores are eternal.  With deft assurance we come to understand a male family of Corrections officers - Peter Boyle as a gasping, respiratory failure grandfather, Billy Bob Thornton as a dutiful father who happens to be the current  active executioner, his son Heath Ledger, a sensitive young man wholly out of tune with racial bias and capital punishment.  Then there is the one to be executed, a wondrous portrayal by Sean Combs, his obese ""never make it looking like that in a Black America"" son who hides in candy bars, and  the resplendent Halle Berry as the wife/mother, victim of society in more ways then one.  The interplay of these extraordinary actors (along with a supporting cast of officers, neighbors, hookers, waitresses so strong that they each could carry a film) results in a story so deeply tender without resorting to bathos that we can only read the final credits in awe and disbelief that life, in many places, is so difficult, yet the human spirit so enduring.

1678542,5,B00005YU1M,"Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) is a corrections officer who has always led a controlled and rather unemotional life in the modern South, a place time seems to have forgotten. Hank doesn't say much but his actions say plenty about him -the hard looks he gives his son, the unflinching way he handles the routines of his job, the racial prejudice which seems sewn to his soul.
 As the movie opens, Hank is about to oversee the execution of an inmate (Sean Combs). Leticia (Halley Berry) is the inmate's wife and this is the role of her career so far, one Berry plays without make-up, as a plain, hardscrabble woman who tries to make the best of her life. It was a courageous move for her to tackle this role and one that has paid off.
  Shortly after the execution of her husband, Leticia is faced with another tragedy and Hank arrives on the scene, reluctantly coming to her aid. Somehow, against his instincts, he finds a kindred soul in this woman and slowly, very slowly, the two form a bond - of sorts. Both Hank and Leticia have never expected much from life and they are both admittedly flawed parents. Their hurt is palpable and yet once they find each other they go forward, not dramatically, not with a clear sense of resolution or even hope but with what I can only call a will to survive and a hunger for connection - in the face of bleakness and hardship.  I would say more but I think it would be unfair to describe the revelations and surprises in this film prematurely.
  I will add, however, some of what I found stunning about this film. The understated, abbreviated, language and realistic worlds of  Hank and Leticia. The way small changes in each of them seem like major victories. The miracle of two such different people connecting and making something better for a time.  The need that each feels for the other, a need that overcomes a lifetime of prejudice (and it is another small miracle that their connection seems believable). The musical score which suggests the emotions behind the unspoken words in this movie.",1024012800,2,2035,4.586776859504132
1678543,1,B00005YU1M,"It's becoming so obvious that the Oscars are political. Totally Political. I believe Halle Berry is a very talented actress and have enjoyed her performances in the past but this film left me empty. The story, while dealing with serious subject matter, was comrpomised with a thin thin story. Billy Bob Tornton merely showed up, Halle Berry was forced to overact to make up for a zero character and the explicit yet boring sex scene was a cheap ploy to get audiences into the theaters. Quite simply, a waste of time for the audience and an Oscar for Halle Berry in a performance that should be an embarrassment.",1024012800,15,611,4.666666666666667
1678544,3,B00005YU1M,"This film is frustrating in that nothing happens for a long time, then the guy picks up a gun and shoots himself. Trying to figure out who we're supposed to like is like busting a nut.  It's a very talky, very arty film. Peter Boyle is convincing as the biggoted father that gets dumped at the nursing home. Billy Bob Thornton is very interesting, particularly when he's painting his walls white. The highlight of the movie is seeing how much better his house looks after he's redecorated it. It almost doesn't look like the same house. I particularly liked how Billy Bob washes up the blood from his recliner and then from the back seat of his car. With the length and attention to detail, these clips could be used in housekeeping training films on proper cleaning techniques. The best scene in the movie is one that was cut where Thornton does his lines as the character from Sling Blade. It was also interesting to see him trying to crack up other members of the cast in the deleted scenes. Halle Berry is very emotional. Yes, she does have her husband executed, but that's not all that emotional until she sees his artwork later on. She gets pretty worked up when her son gets hit by a car. Later, she gets really steamed while tanked on her sofa with Billy Bob. While I couldn't exactly identify why she was feeling what she was, or even exactly what it was that she was feeling, she certainly felt a lot. Her performance is the reason to sit through this otherwise pretentious, slow-paced, self-obsessed piece of cinema. Heath Ledger should be noted for looking particularly bloated after his other two films. It's nice to see that even hunks can gain weight. This movie is a great curiosity piece to see why the Academy voted an Oscar. Or you could just rent Moulin Rouge and enjoy your evening.",1024012800,,1803,4.564814814814815
1678545,5,B00005YU1M,"Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Barry have both given the performances of their careers here.  I can see why Halle won that Oscar, which is the only reason I really wanted to see this dark, depressing, stark movie.  This is not for the faint of heart, and if you are just looking for light entertainment, look elsewhere. We are talking deep here.
""Monster's Ball"" is a look into two people lives, Hank & Leticia, and how their characters connect through the whole movie -- Her husband is executed on death row, and Hank is one of the corrections officers that assist in the execution. Sean ""Puffy"" Combs plays the husband, and he is quite impressive. The film also shows how they end up after so much tragedy is bestowed upon both of them. They both lose their sons, but in some sense, I didn't see them really grieving for their loss which is one part of their character that truly bonds them.  They are both extremely complex, angry characters, and you want to have sympathy for them, but it isn't easy. As the film moves on, you start to feel for these characters. We get to know them on a personal level.
That aside, the performances by these two well crafted actors is just awe inspiring. It is a film worth watching just for the acting.
This is an amazingly well crafted piece of work, the acting, cinematography, excellent screenplay, and realism of it is all just brilliant.  Even if it is very depressing it is also extremely engrossing, I made myself stay up way past my bedtime to watch the entire movie.  It was one of the most moving pieces of cinema I've ever witnessed.
For dvd buyers, this is worth buying just to see Thornton's character ""Karl"" from ""Sling Blade"" play ""Hank"".
There are about four deleted scenes, and a trailer, and a little piece on how the movie was scored.  That was pretty interesting.

The great achievment of the movie is the direction of Marc Foster.  Some films reach the status of works of art and some do not.  Monster ball has reached this status.  Each scene is so well structured that you become uncomfortable.  At times I felt as though I was spying on these people.  Marc Forster allows you to become personnal with the characters and you feel their pain.  I loved this film.

Why did Halle Berry win an Oscar for her performance? She's worthy of an Oscar  for Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, not Monster's Ball. There had to have been another reason because her acting wasn't the reason. Maybe it was because of her sex scene with Billy Bob? Or maybe the Academy felt it was her turn. Lion's Gate known for 'B at best' movies, didn't spend a cent to include a program insert. I guess it was to keep the price down, or maybe they agree Monster's Ball wasn't worth the cost.

(Just do what your parents taught you back when you were young... cover your eyes.
This movie has a very good point and it's a great movie for people who are interracial dating like myself.

It also shows you how when you ""know""...you ""know"".What I mean by that is that no matter what, when you know you fall in love with someone you will know it. Love has no color, love has no face, but when you feel it inside, you will know that you are in love at that time and place.

It's a love story based on tragedy and rebounding chemistry, but any issues far from relationships are only touched periphally and with shallow direction.  Nevertheless, the connection between Thornton's development into a better human being and Halle Berry's struggle to survive through life is undeniably acute, but it seems that her Oscar award is biased towards her beauty and pornography rather than her acting.  She is indeed a good actress, but her role and performance is at least one notch below Academy Award.  Billy Bob Thornton as always has strength in subtlety, and his emotions are very complimentary when paired with Berry's.  Sean Combs deserves all the praise to come from his part, but all acting aside this movie is weak in final result.  Many people mention the sex scenes as well, and they are well implemented but of no more mention than any other scene.  The cinematography is very good, and the dialogue plays well between the characters which are richly defined, but the inconclusive  and ineffective ending abandons the characters as almost meaningless to any theme the movie may contain.  The ending has potential to be moving, but in contrast to Fallen Angels it falls flat and insipid.  Overall, if you want to see a movie that deals with tragedy and love, try Monster's Ball, but if you're looking for a movie with any depth of racial or social insights, watch Malcom X or American History X.",1021680000,3,1531,4.8538461538461535

1678557,5,B00005YU1M,"This movie is so over-the-top!
I saw the film the day it was released nationwide.  Hallie gave a stunning performance and deserved the Oscar.  Billy Bob Thornton's performance was a work-of-art and I believe he also deserved an Oscar.
The actors in this film are able to make you 'forget' you are watching actors create a role. You seriously get the feeling that you're watching interaction between two ordinary people living extraodrinarily painful portions of their lives and undergoing major changes in their beliefs and emotions.
These performances were models of self-expression, but I have never seen that acting method better put-to-use (OK, maybe by BBT in Sling Blade, but that is a movie-unto-itself) than this touching movie.
As the changes in Thornton's character begin to evolve, I found a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes for a bitter man who was metamorphosing from a rude, bottled-up, miserable human being to a kind, caring man with a lot-to-give and a need that required a great deal of filling-up. These poignant feelings were often evoked with the speaking of painfully few words, but by speaking them in just the right tone and manner BBT was able to make that transformation real and believable.
Much has been made of the 'sex-scene' concerning the 'why', the 'how' it was filmed, etc.  By filming the scene through the furniture, superimposed by the fan, etc. it became a touching portrayal of two people exchanging an unexpectedly intimate moment in a beautiful and passionate manner that was obviously  unexpected and clearly new to each of them; rather than a crude, overtly gratuitous and raw-sex act.  It was more about discovery, comfort, and emotional need than about the passion of sex.
While the movie may make some uncomfortable, it was very real, extremely thought-provoking, and in my mind a 'beautiful' movie.  I urge those who avoid theaters and wait for release on Video/CD to buy this film as soon it is released.  It is worth the wait you have had so far...and then some.  I think you are going to want to view it more than once.  I know I can't wait to get my copy and see it again.",1021334400,11,2129,4.795081967213115

And what a performance it is! She is nothing short of superb and shows why she took that little man home Oscar night. Anyone that has been following Halle's career should not be shocked. From her first role in Jungle Fever to Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, Halle has shown why her star shines. I would be remiss if I did not mention the other superb performance in this film, Billy Bob Thornton. I thought he was great and should also have been singled out. There is also nice work from Sean ""Puffy"" Combs in a beautifully understated role, Peter Doyle and Heath Ledger. This is a great film!",1020124800,6,941,4.322033898305085

While the theme of racism is prominent, there are other themes that relate to family, history, and choices.  This is a tragic tale, yet having grown up in the South and grown up poor, I can envision the type of scenarios that comprise these lives (although death through govenment-instituted electrocution is a stretch, at least in most states).
Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton have incredible chemistry that one may not expect from these two very different actors.  Halle Berry definitely deserved the Academy Award for her performance. The supporting cast is superb.  The perfomance by Sean Combs is surprisingly good.  This is a ""character"" movie, and none of the actors let you down.  From the beginning, the small details of the characters' actions make you feel like these could be people next door (even more real if you are familiar with the deep south).  I was actually surprised that the movie did not receive more Academy nods, as the acting was incredible.
Much has been made of the sex scene between Hank and Leticia (Thornton and Berry).  While I wouldn't let my children watch, this scene, like the rest of the movie, serves a purpose.  It is not at all gratuitous, as we learn something about the characters and where they are in their lives based on their actions in this scene.  I thought it was very well done.

1678570,5,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball"" involves some of the hottest romantic chemistry ever present on screen.  The sizzling cauldron of sparks between Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton helped to result in the former securing the first ever Best Actress Academy Award for an African American.
The drama directed by Sundance Festival success story Marc Forester reveals a strong character arc by white Southerner Thornton to overcome previous prejudice and ultimately find love with Berry, a result developing from second chances of two people seeking to rebound from comparable tragedies.
Thornton plays the middle layer of the Grotowski family.  His father, played by Peter Boyle, is an inveterate racist segregationist dying from emphysema.  Thornton's son, played by Heath Ledger, is a sensitive young man with liberal racial views.  Boyle is a retired prison guard, the same job his son and grandson hold.
When Boyle observes two African American youngsters on their property in front of the rural Georgia home where they live, Thornton is commanded to evict them.  He does so after they explain they have come to visit his son Sonny, played by Ledger.  He fires his shotgun into the air so they will get the point that they are unwelcome.
Eventually a confrontation between father and son regarding Ledger's liberal attitude toward African American death row prisoners results in Ledger, after pistol whipping his father, turning the gun on himself and committing suicide.
The death changes Thornton, who promptly resigns his post, haunted by having, in a state of anger, uttered as the final words to his son, ""I hate you.""  Ledger's final words to his father before killing himself are, ""I always loved you.""
At this juncture Thornton meets Berry, picking her up by the side of the road on a rainy night after her son has been badly injured by a hit and run driver.  This comes not long after her husband, who had spent 11 years on death row, has been executed.  Thornton drives Berry and her son to the hospital, where he dies.
Two people immersed in tragedy then find love in a daring relationship, given the propensities of many in the small rural Southern town.  Berry and Thornton appreciably grow in direct proportion to their bond of love.  This is a daring film in which two people rise to new levels of awareness as a result of their dynamic interaction and desire to please one another.",1018828800,9,2382,4.93

Because of the wonderful performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry (and even Sean Combs), this movie was very true-to-life and revealing.  I'm no fool:  I know that racial tensions run deep in the southern USA, but this film makes it more real to me than it ever has been.

1678575,4,B00005YU1M,"That's the fatalistic message of this movie, I think. And there's more than one kind of past, too: our personal past and the larger, societal past.
The larger canvas upon which ""Monster's Ball"" is painted is the modern Deep South, where race issues still seethe despite the Civil War's hundred year ago ending. Young black youths are shot at in order to get them off Billy Bob Thornton's land, because his father Peter Boyle hates blacks and doesn't want them anywhere near. Old Peter Boyle also has a nastily racist thing or two to say to Halle Berry when she innocently enters his house looking for her new boyfriend Billy Bob, who has never gotten around to mentioning that he is the corrections officer who oversaw her husband's execution.
So that's the recent past that is so troublesome, too. Billy Bob would like to make a fresh start of things, especially after a Shocking Tragedy concerning his detested son. Halle has had some Harrowing Experiences lately that she too would like to forget, but just when both think they may have gotten over these things, bingo! Past Hurts swell up fresh again.
Personally, I think the true Oscar contender here ought to have been Billy Bob, whose depiction of the corrections officer is fascinatingly subtle. I just never knew what he was going to do next. Halle does a LOT of screaming, whether in an emergency room or during sex it doesn't really matter. When a friend asked me about her, I said she's a lightweight actress in a heavyweight role. She still looked too glamorous to be this woman in this predicament. It would have been more daring on the movie maker's part to cast Whoopi Goldberg or another black woman who conveys having put up with a lot of unpleasantness in life. So, four stars, but completely for Billy Bob's sake.",1017878400,2,1783,4.699680511182109
1678576,5,B00005YU1M,"Monster's Ball is a controversial film based around the lives of Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), and Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry).  Grotowski is introduced as a Caucasian male working for the Department of Corrections, in Georgia.  For Hank, the only life he knows is that of his work.  This is shown through his relationships with his father, Buck (Peter Boyle), and his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), who is also a corrections officer for the state of Georgia.  However, as the story progresses, Leticia Musgrove is forcefully thrown into Hank's life.  Leticia is a widowed, African-American female struggling to keep her house, her car, and most importantly to keep her life together.  As Hank's and Leticia's relationship explores areas neither of them expected, their views and ways of life take that same unexpected turn.
Monster's Ball touches all sorts of social issues.  The most prominent issue throughout the whole picture is racism.  It is clearly shown how racial prejudices are passed to the next generation, and also how they are broken between generations.  Although this is the major issue throughout the film, Monster's Ball also touches base with issues such as capital punishment, family issues, and the complexities of relationships--especially those involving different races.
Overall, this film left me with a great feeling.  It has been a long time since I have seen a movie with such character development as this.

1678578,5,B00005YU1M,"It's very rare, but occasionally a film comes along that plays out so realistically that it doesn't even seem like you're watching a movie, but participating-- albeit as an observer-- in this particular drama of life that is unfolding around you.  And so it is with ""Monster's Ball,"" a riveting film, directed by Marc Forster, that is so real it transcends entertainment and becomes a voyeuristic experience that leaves you with the sense that you've been through everything that's happened yourself.  It's a thought provoking examination of relationships and perspectives, including the ingrained, subjective attitudes-- especially prejudices-- that have such a profound and lasting affect on our lives, as well as the lives of those around us.  It's a film that says so much about the way we respond to one another, as well as certain situations, and why; in short, it's about the world that we, as a society, have created and must live in together-- right or wrong, good or bad, black or white.  And at the heart of the story is a message that rings through loud and true; a perception that we can do better-- and must-- if we are to survive as a civilized, dignified and progressive species.  In the final analysis, we are, all of us, members of the family of Man; and it's time we realize and acknowledge it.
 After eleven years on death row at a Georgia State Penitentiary, Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs) is out of appeals and is headed for the electric chair.  There to make their final visit is Musgrove's wife, Leticia (Halle Berry), and their son, Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun), while veteran corrections officer Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) oversees the proceedings.  Also on hand is third-generation corrections officer Sonny Grotowski (Heath Ledger), who during Musgrove's final walk discovers he doesn't have the stomach required to perform his duties, which will later create some conflict with his father.
 Bigotry, it seems, is something of a family trait;  Hank's father, Buck (Peter Boyle), a retired corrections officer, is the product of a time when African Americans ""knew their place.""  But it's an attitude that's apparently become somewhat watered down in his family from one generation to the next.  Hank seems almost indifferent, even apathetic, when it comes to race, though under stress, especially, he defers to his father's views.  Sonny, however, has a mind of his own, and by nature is more willing to embrace all of the myriad and diverse aspects of life as he sees it.  And with the three generations of Grotowski men living under one roof, needless to say, there is more than some tension in the household, which inevitably leads to tragedy.
 Leticia, meanwhile, is riding a downward spiral in her own life, attempting to cope with both her husband's situation and a problem with her son, while having to make a living on top of it all.  And just when it seems that her world is about to fall into total collapse, circumstances bring her into contact with-- of all people-- Hank Grotowski.  Call it fate, or just one of those things; but it becomes a turning point, not only in their lives, but in the lives of a number of people close to them.  And very soon, for Hank and Leticia, especially, the world becomes a very different place.
 Working from a screenplay by Milo Addica and Will Rokos that is intelligent, incisive and uncompromising, Forster delivers an emotionally absorbing drama that is raw, insightful and presented with a subtle intensity that is so thoroughly engrossing it becomes mesmerizing.  It's a film that does not allow the viewer the luxury of casual observation or an indifferent attitude; the story is told in terms that are so brutally honest and starkly realistic that it does not provide for neutral ground or ambiguity on the part of it's audience.  This is powerful drama, and Forster makes sure that everyone watching has the sense of actually being included as the story unfolds.  He makes you a part of this world in which Hank, Leticia and the others live-- there's no standing on the sidelines with this one.  As in real life, with this film you are confronted with situations that demand resolution and force you to make decisions.
 It takes a number of elements to make a truly great film, of course, and in this one they all come together beautifully-- especially in the performances, beginning with Billy Bob Thornton, who is without question one of the best leading men/character actors in the business.  He's a true chameleon who never ceases to amaze with his versatility and his ability to create believable, interesting and memorable characters, from Karl (arguably his most memorable) in ""Sling Blade,"" to Jacob in ""A Simple Plan,"" or Russell in ""Pushing Tin"" to Hank in this film, whom he captures with absolutely incredible subtlety and depth.  It's a terrific performance, delivered with nuance and restraint, and it should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it was clearly one of the best performances of the year.
 What really takes this film to a higher level, though, is the extraordinary performance by Halle Berry as Leticia, in whom she creates a finely layered, three-dimensional character that is singularly effective and entirely believable and real.  In Leticia, you will find every conceivable emotion woven around conflicts born of the definitive complexities of life, the things we all experience in one way or another at one time or another, and to which everyone will be able to relate on some level, according to personal experience.  In this performance, Berry does it all and gives her all, and it's work for which she deservedly was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress.  When you come away from this film, it's with the indelible images of Leticia and Hank burned into your memory, thanks to the talents of Berry, Thornton and Forster.  ""Monster's Ball"" is compelling, unforgettable drama, and an example of filmmaking at it's best.",1017532800,11,5944,4.931795386158475

1678592,4,B00005YU1M,"A miraculous streak of destiny unites together poverty-strickened Leticia (Halle Berry) and execution officer Hank Gratowski (Billy Bob Thornton) in an inter-racial romance. Both are haunted by the loss of their beloved ones and draws on emotional solace through intense sexual communication. The tragedy unfolds in the town of Southern Georgia where racial discrimination is rampant - and the flawed characters reflect silently the dysfunctional society through their mannerism and attitude. Leticia castigates her obese son to shed his weight to prove ""blacks are not a disgrace""; Hank is tortured in a rigid families where obligations conflicts with a strained father-and-son relationship. They meet under a twist of fate - and their romance is at once tenuous and fragile with the hidden truths...
MONSTER'S BALL would not have been such a triumph if not for the strength of the versatile Billy Bob Thornton who injects subdued grief and sensitivity to the character, where Hank matures under the harsh lessons and eradicates his racism to translate his yearning for love and passion. Halle Berry in what may be her most explosive and visceral performance yet as the dignified Leticia, elevates the emotional core of the love-story. Their heated sex is a vent for their frustration and injustice done to them. Supporting cast including Heath Ledger as Hank's suppressed son and Peter Boyle as Hank's imperious father proves equally arresting.
Yet as a movie Monster's Ball under Marc Forster's direction fails to break through of the love-story mold to enhance with symbolism and unravel the truths. It is a pity that the darkness of the surburban renders atmosphere and scenes like where their hands are intertwined behind a cage/fan to suggest deeper interpretation, yet it never succeeds to give the audience a clear meaning to that symbolism. There is lack of elaboration and thus totally left to the grounds of imagination even to the point of its inconclusive epilogue.
As such, Monster's Ball is bolstered on the calibre of the seasoned ensemble to waltz the graceful tango of love and raw desperation. It is essentially a love-story when it could have been so much more as an insight on racism and character study.",1016755200,,2226,5.1689750692520775
1678593,5,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball,"" directed by Marc Forster, focuses on two main characters: Hank Grotowski (played by Billy Bob Thornton), a white death row corrections officer who lives with his viciously racist father, and Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), a black woman who struggles to raise her overweight son while her husband awaits execution in Hank's workplace. These two very different people are brought together in an intense relationship.
This is a raw, gripping film. It's a pretty dark piece at times: its characters are mired in poverty, familial dysfunction, and/or racism, and there are some graphic, heartbreaking scenes of human suffering. There are also some extremely graphic sex scenes, but I feel this extreme material is wholly relevant to the characters and plot.
The performances really make this film special. Coronji Calhoun is quite touching as Leticia's son. Heath Ledger and Peter Boyle offer solid support as Hank's son and father. But the film really hinges on the two leads, and they are extraordinary. Thornton brings a depth and complexity to this very difficult character. And Halle Berry! At times explosive, at times quiet and subdued, she creates a rich and full portrait of a woman going through both tragedy and passion.
""Monster's Ball"" asks whether, in the midst of suffering and irrational hate, there exists the possibility for redemptive love and personal transformation. I found it to be a very moving film.",1015804800,11,1438,5.229437229437229
1678594,4,B00005YU1M,"""Monster's Ball"" is the kind of movie that does one of two things: it either gives one the incentive to scribe thousands of pages in favor of or against its exposition, or it leaves one without a single word to put down. It operates on many different levels, addressing controversial issues that evoke a variety of emotional reactions in its well-drawn characters, and in the audience.
The movie begins, oddly enough, with an execution that will bring the central characters together in a foray of tragedy and loss. We meet corrections officer Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), the son of a retired corrections officer whose racism runs deep within his son's beliefs. Hank's own son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), suffers from his own personal demons as a result of his father's unwillingness to show him an emotional support.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, Lawrence's wife, Leticia (Halle Berry), is ready for her emotional grief to come to an end, along with her husband's life. Eleven years of raising their obese son, Tyrell, and working as a waitress to make payments on their home, has burdened her into chain-smoking and drinking, In the last moments of her visit with Lawrence, all she can say is ""The only reason I'm here is so you could say goodbye to your son.""
And then things change. Hank and Leticia undergo personal tragedies of which I will not speak, but will compliment due to their quiet sense of dread. It is at this point that the story takes a uniquely affecting turn, as these two needy souls find themselves drawn to one another out of a need for support, which soon develops into something much richer.
We, as an audience, know there will be complications arising from their relationship, due in part to Hank's racist father, as well as a secret he keeps hidden from Leticia concerning her husband. There are two solutions to these problems, one that brims with dark comedy, one that closes the film on a note of justly deserved uncertainty, each effectively brilliant in their own way.
At the center of this are two very outstanding performances from Thornton and Berry, who make their characters two of the year's most convincing. Thornton has always been a man of little words (save for his previous work in the disastrous ""Bandits""); here, he gets in touch with his ""Simple Plan"" roots by incorporating Hank with a quiet change of heart. Thornton is able to convey Hank's realization of his faults with just a few simple words, keeping the segue subtle and impacting.
Berry's character, on the other hand, is more outward about her feelings, a trait that is somewhat befuddling to the conserved Hank. In perhaps the most controversial role of her career, she throws everything she has into the role of Leticia, giving us an unblinking performance that brings out the very best of her ability. In Leticia's many emotional displays and overwhelming moments of grief and pain, Berry makes us believe in the inner torments her characters must face, and comes out blazing.
There are two problems I found in the film: one is its unwillingness to expand on the issue of the death penalty, the other its somewhat distanced examination of the interracial relationship between Leticia and Hank. The movie never gives us a reason to feel that there is a threat to their being together, while the execution is little more than a mere plot device used to advance the plot. Even still, ""Monster's Ball"" benefits from a realistic look at racism, as well as its examination of the changes people undergo in the wake of personal tragedy.",1015718400,11,3550,4.821311475409836

1678602,4,B00005YU1M,"MONSTER'S BALL is the ""party"" the other corrections officers throw following a new correction officer's first execution. Sonny Grotowski (Heath Ledger), a corrections officer in the Georgia penal system is assigned to the death house the night Sean ""Puffy"" Combs is executed. The audience will witness Combs' death, and his execution is graphic, but having witnessed it maybe we can better appreciate why the Grotowski family implodes afterward.
Death row executions have been depicted before in ""The Green Mile"", ""The Chamber"", and ""Dead Man Walking.""  Elements of all three of these films can be found in this film--transcendance (Green Mile); breakdown of body functions (Chamber); and the pathos of the victim (Dead Man). Yet, Monster's Ball is different. The storyline focuses on those who carry out the executions--the executioner.
For the most part, the wonderful cast assembled for this film make you believe. Sean Combs may be a bit too wise and insightful for his ending but we have no idea how long he has been on death row, and perhaps like Carla Faye Tucker, he has become a better person from having faced the prospect of his own extinction. If you're opposed to the death penalty you may find yourself sickened by some of the scenes. Still, this film does not appear to be about ""ending the death penalty"" as much as it is about the effects of execution on those who must carry it out.
Halle Berry's character Leticia Musgrove reminded me of Susan Sarandon's character (a waitress) in ""White Palace."" She is a very fine actress, and I hope she is nominated for and wins the Academy Award for best actress.  Billy Bob Thorton's character Hank Grotowski is more assertive and luckier than his character in ""The Man Who Wasn't There.""

1678603,5,B00005YU1M,"- The Setting -
In a quiet small town somewhere in Georgia:  Scene 1: Introductions of the leading male and the leading female, both extremely different in every way save for a past connection that links their lives.  Scene 2: an unlikely love affair develops between the two after a chance meeting.
- The Dancers -:
He is Billy Bob Thornton, as corrections officer Hank Grotowski.  He lives with his racially intolerant father Buck (Peter Boyle), and his weak-in-character son Sonny (Heath Ledger), both of whom are also corrections officers - the family profession.  Despite their close proximity with him, he is far apart from them in spirit.  He despises his father for his backward racist mindsets and his son for not having the spine to do the family job, but he gets ugly only with the latter.
She is Halle Berry, as Leticia Musgrove, a recent widow after her convict husband (Sean ""Puffy"" Combs) is executed.  In his departure, she is left to care for her 11-year-old son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) while barely trying to make ends meet.  Her life takes a turn for the worse in a series of hardships and tragedy, leaving her all alone.  Incidentally, Hank is on duty for her husband's execution, to her unawareness.
- The Dance -
Very well done (considering how much I detest romance films).  Both are brought together by personal tragedies, but drawn together for different reasons.  Hank wants to escape his dysfunctional family trappings and start afresh, Leticia needs companionship to escape loneliness.  Their characters are so well-captured in their profiles and their sufferings, while not forgetting the hurtles of racial bigotry that both must overcome, plus their responses towards the revelation of their dark connection to each other.  Forster delves extensively into the characters' afflictions to illustrate that true love can blossom not only in spite of them but also because of them.  The love scenes are extremely erotic.
- The Dancing -
Thorton defines dysfunction in the middle of the Grotowski family.  As the embittered Hank, he shows detached piety towards Buck and harsh overbearance towards Sonny.  Boyle lends support as the weak (in body) but strong (in spirit) Buck, with Ledger as the strong (in body) but weak (in spirit) Sonny.  Both are convincing in their roles to reinforce Hank's dysfunction background.  In an Oscar-caliber performance, Berry is excellent as the emotionally fragile widow.  She vividly shows Leticia's need for security following her painful tribulations, her grief with after every one of them, and her efforts to come to terms upon knowing the past between Hank and her husband.  As for Mr. Combs' acting turn, I could have sworn he was trying to rap his lines.  Maybe it's just me.  But he delivers a brief but good moment of anguish for his characters coming to grips with his impending fate.
- The Verdict -
A terrific love story, even without a tragic ending.  Though the interracial spin is nothing new, it is given a melancholy perspective under Forster's direction, in grim realism without the typical happily-ever-after ending. And it has great characterizations and excellent performances by the cast.  The open-ending finale leaves the unanswered question as to the fate of the lovers' relationship.  Then again, such is true in relationships of today.",1010275200,43,3324,5.045787545787546

1678605,5,B00005YU1M,"Billy Bob Thornton already has a fine movie to his credit for the 2001 film season, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. He stars in MONSTER'S BALL, a film that may possibly vie with IN THE BEDROOM for multiple Oscars.
Here, Thornton plays Hank Grotowski, a senior corrections officer at a prison ostensibly placed in Georgia. Hank supervises a team of officers, which includes his son Sonny (Heath Ledger), and which is assigned to carry out the electric chair execution of a black convict. (Incidentally, a ""monster's ball"" is defined as the party thrown for a prison guard before he attends at his first execution.) Living with Hank at home is his aging, physically debilitated and venomously racist father, Buck (Peter Boyle), formerly a prison guard also.
The wife of the man to be executed is Leticia, played by Halle Berry. She's gamely trying to pay the rent and keep the car running by working as a waitress, and is raising an overweight son whom she sharply disciplines in an attempt to get him to stop eating everything in sight. (Leticia is convinced that fat, black men don't have a chance in America.)
Both Hank and Leticia are leading separate lives of quiet - and sometimes not so quiet - desperation, each being psychologically and emotionally dragged under by circumstances and taxing personal relationships. Then, in a series of traumatic events over a short period of time, each is cut free of burdens and left, through serendipitous accident, with only each other.
MONSTER'S BALL contains several volatile scenes of emotions on the rawest of edges, and which will keep the viewer riveted. Thornton and Berry both give exemplary performances as two people in unlikely company coming to grip with personal demons. As fair warning to the sensitive, the film incorporates episodes of intense sexuality.
Thornton has become one of my favorite actors, and this is the first time I've seen Berry in any role. I liked this movie very much, and would be hard pressed to choose between it and IN THE BEDROOM for this year's Best Picture Academy Award.",1010188800,146,2051,4.8796561604584525
1678606,4,B00005YU1M,"Marc Forster's ""Monster's Ball"" contains a host of horrific deeds and actions in its' first 40 minutes...so many in fact, I almost walked out of the theater: child abuse, attempted patricide, suicide, public execution, racial hatred to name several. I felt like yelling at the screen:  ENOUGH ALREADY!  But a morbid fascination with where this movie was going made me stay in my seat, mouth open...and I can honestly say that ultimately ""Monster's Ball"" proved to be worth my time and effort.
But,the big question here is:  why show so much negativity? Does so much downbeat material make for an uplifting, or more importantly interesting movie experience? Does: ""I'm so down...it looks like up to me"" apply here? Why have your main character,Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) exhibit such self-loathing and hatred and thereby making him unpalatable as a hero?  And ultimately does Hank's metamorphosis into a loving person make sense?
I don't have all the answers but I certainly do have impressions and can attest to the cumulative power of the images presented.  Hanks's conversion from bigot to loving, caring human being and Leticia's (Halle Berry)lover doesn't make logical sense but we are rooting for ""them"" to work and so when it does we believe it. Hank and Leticia are two lost souls, at the end of their psychic ropes, whose only hope for survival is each other.  And so they cling and they claw and they gravitate towards each other as only the desperate are won't to do.  As Leticia says to Hank in as heartbreaking a way as possible, and after years of being tread upon and beaten down: ""I need you to take care of me.""
Much has been said of Halle Berry's performance and it is a wonder: frustrated, down-and-out, sexually repressed, needy, tired and worn out but always exhibiting the smallest kernel of hope. Billy Bob Thornton wakes up from his zombie-like performance in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and makes Hank a living breathing character...fantastically flawed yet seemingly capable of turning his life around.
""Monster's Ball"" will be a hard watch for many people and it's flaws might be enough to turn people off but ultimately it is a profoundly even perversely powerful film...not for everyone but for the few who can appreciate the redemptive power of LOVE.",1009929600,33,2287,4.9246753246753245
