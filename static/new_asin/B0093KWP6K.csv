5256249,4,B0093KWP6K,"3.5 out of 5 stars for TERI MERI KAHAANI.

Sometimes a movie just begs for the flowery stuff, and then when it's a Bollywood picture? Fuggetaboutit... TERI MERI KAHAANI - which, I think, means ""Our Story"" - posits that true love perseveres, that it is everlasting, or, at least, that it lasts three lifetimes. Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra strive to convince you of such. This film spans three eras, with each era featuring a pair of lovers as portrayed by Shahid and Priyanka. The story unfolds not in chronological order.

It opens in Bombay in 1960 as breezy but unemployed musician Govind (Shahid) bumps into famous Bollywood actress Ruksar (Priyanka) on a Poona-to-Bombay rail coach. Their flirtation persists all the way to the Bollywood studio, but then is derailed by an unexpected love triangle. As things look their bleakest, the camera cuts away...

...to present day, 2012, in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, as college students Radha Chopra (Priyanka) and Krish Kapoor (Shahid) collide into each other. It's not an auspicious encounter as Radha gets Krish arrested, and this on his birthday. Still, they end up hanging out all night and this leads to something more serious, as evidenced by a montage of flirty online chats and smartphone banter. But then the film dusts off that old ""We were on a break!"" running gag from FRIENDS, and Radha furiously ends up breaking up with Krish. The camera shows us a moping Krish but then the venue shifts and rewinds back...

...to 1910, in Sargoda, Lahore, in pre-independence India, wherein loquacious Muslim poet and inveterate womanizer Javed Qadri (played by you know who) whiles away the days by courting the village beauties and skirting an honest day's work. All that changes when Javed is chased by a British official's guards and is saved by Aradhana (played by you know who), vibrant daughter of a nationalist Sikh. Javed is instantly smitten, and perhaps so is Aradhana, except she's savvy enough not to show it. This arc, set during the British Raj, is the longest of the three and is highlighted by Javed's unflagging pursuit of Aradhana and his conversion from layabout to a man with a cause. And maybe it makes sense that this earliest period is saved for last, because this is when we discover the root of that which links the three stories.

TERI MERI KAHAANI disdains a time-honored Bollywood tradition. I was expecting (and dreading) the moment in which one or both leads finally recalled their past lives. Refreshingly, the characters remain oblivious of their past incarnations, and so the viewer manages to elude one of them clunky melodramatic tropes.

Not that I've been in India, and especially in India in 1910 and 1960, but I thought those periods were well recreated, the look and the feel and the cultural pulse. A series of clips during the closing credits reveals in part how the 1960s era was captured thru the generous application of blue and green screens. I had a good time with the musical numbers, and I thought each song & dance segment fit its respective era. The easy standout for me is the dynamite, bhangra-flavored ""Humse Pyaar Karle Tu"" which was staged in a prison compound during the Punjab segment. Priyanka and Shahid would like to remind you and me that, damn straight, they can dance the hell out of a Bollywood track. They also have chemistry together in all their diverse roles, although they're both best during the 1910 Punjab segment (the longest of the three vignettes).

So that was the pat on the head. Here's the kick in the pants. The film occasionally suffers from sluggish sequences. And let's be honest: Each of the three arcs by itself comes off as a routine Bollywood romance. Instead, the draw is in seeing each narrative thread woven into a cohesive, almost overlapping tapestry. The three pairs of lovers are unoriginal sorts and hampered with shallow character conflicts. It smacks of lazy writing that - oh, and SPOILERS for the rest of this paragraph - Aradhana becomes a widow at the eleventh hour, thus making it super convenient for Javed to get the girl, never mind that this deprives us of the punch of a morale-driven conflict. Thankfully, Priyanka and Shahid are so watchable they end up overcoming most of these flaws. But, no contest,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Aaj-Kal-Two-Disc-Set/dp/B002Q6RZ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Aaj Kal (Two Disc Set)</a>&nbsp;did it better.

Okay, so serendipity or fate? A heartfelt remark uttered once and discarded or one that becomes prophetic? Admittedly, the gist of the plot plumbs familiar territory in Bollywood cinema. So, instead, check out TERI MERI KAHAANI for its storytelling mechanics and its evocative set pieces and for the robust number ""Humse Pyaar Karle Tu."" I'm calling Priyanka's performance in that number to be her best yet. Or at least my favorite. And Shahid persists in being one of them dudes I never want to see standing next to me, mostly because I'd never survive the comparison.",1360195200,7,5035,5.050541516245487
5256250,5,B0093KWP6K,"With Shahid & Priyanka in the lead roles, you can expect a good film but what I liked about this one, was the music!  Great music.",1359331200,,130,4.0
5256251,4,B0093KWP6K,This movie is a nice light love story that anyone can enjoy. Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra perform really well in their roles and the director did a great job of melding the three timelines together. Def worth a watch...,1357689600,,224,4.625
5256252,5,B0093KWP6K,I love bollywood movies but this was modern different then the rest and absolutely entertaining it had my attention the whole time. The chemistry and the way shahid and priyanka acted completely complemented each other. They music was great I loved every song and they both danced so well. I recommend it!,1357516800,,305,4.884615384615385
5256253,5,B0093KWP6K,"I am fairly new to Bollywood (1 1/2 years)so still have a lot to discover.  But I thought this movie was one of the most enjoyable I've seen so far.  I loved Javed and Aradhana's story best, probably because the dialog was so romantic.  What woman wouldn't want a man to say ""If you were to see what I see in you, you'd be in love with you too""!  I really enjoyed all the songs which were written to help move the story along, unlike some movies where the songs have little to do with the story.  Favorite song was probably Jab Se Mere Dil Ko Uff from the 60's era (lots of fun), but also loved the song and dance from the 1900's era.  The dancing was wonderful. Shahid is a marvelous dancer but Priyanka didn't seem to have any problems keeping up with him.  Major chemistry between the two of them.  I'm looking forward to exploring more of Kunal Kohli's movies, to see if he's always this romantic with his dialog.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys beautiful people dancing and romancing, and looking like they are having a lot of fun in the process.",1356825600,3,1071,4.315
5256254,4,B0093KWP6K,"I'd actually give this movie a wavering 4 1/2 to 5 stars. It was very good and I enjoyed it but I think I built it up a little too high in my mind while waiting for it so I'm not fully adjusted to what it is yet. I've only had time to watch it twice so far. My favorite of the love stories is that of Javed and Aradhana, which might be because I adore the song and dance number from Humse Pyaar Kar Le Tu. The other song and dance numbers are wonderful too but this one is the cream of the crop for me. La sigh! I would recommend it for light hearted fun and romance, with some interesting insights here and there.",1351382400,3,614,3.880952380952381
8535219,1,B0093KWP6K,"Couldn't watch it.  Even though it said that it had English and Arabic subtitles, no matter what we clicked on, the subtitles all came out in Arabic.  Just opened package but wasn't able to exchange because the time had expired.  Very disappointed.",1451692800,,248,4.857142857142857
8535220,5,B0093KWP6K,"good movie, great dancing and singing, good story line, superior acting from PC and Shahid Kapoor",1424822400,,97,5.125
8535221,5,B0093KWP6K,"BEST Bollywood flick I've seen in a while. After I recieved my dvd, I must've watched it 3 times in less than 2 weeks! The 60's seen was by far the BEST part of it!!!",1411084800,,166,3.7714285714285714
8535222,4,B0093KWP6K,Shahid Kapoor is really starting to become one of my favorites and Priyanka Chopra is just as gorgeous as ever I love her acting. If your looking for a fun light bollywood flick this is perfect. There is technically three separate love stories all in different eras one in modern day 2012 another in the 1960's and one in 1910. My favorite one was in 1910 honestly I kind of wished they made a whole movie based off that plot alone and my least fave was the modern day one I just wasn't feeling it as much hence knocking off a star. Anyways overall really liked the movie and there were some really great songs  to go with it.,1399248000,,626,4.260504201680672
8535223,3,B0093KWP6K,"Two of my favorite actors combined.  But I did not realize the story was so naughty at times.  I was not expecting that, and I found it uncomfortable to watch.  But the seller was helpful.",1397692800,,188,4.314285714285714
8535224,5,B0093KWP6K,"Love the movie. It is perfect, the DVD is ok well done well packed. I love Bollywood forever and ever.",1368403200,,102,4.15
8535225,4,B0093KWP6K,It starts a little slow & predictably(bollywood -wise) but has some unexpected twists along the way and these two are so charming and attractive that any weaknesses are easily overlooked.,1368403200,,187,5.266666666666667
8535226,3,B0093KWP6K,"I love the movie. You will have to have a Blu-ray or a DVD player that
has sub-title options. The movie still did not have the sub-titles.
I am keeping the movie because of the sub-title option on my Blu-Ray, because I require
the English sub-titles.
The marketing and package say English sub-titles, it is not on the DVD?",1367452800,4,322,4.47457627118644
8535227,4,B0093KWP6K,"I like watching Pyryanka, she is beautiful. I also feel Shahid Kapoor did very well in this movie. I think this was a very refreshing movie.",1361404800,,140,4.423076923076923
8535228,2,B0093KWP6K,"I usually enjoy Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra.  I just did not like this whole movie.  The first story was unbearable.  It reminded me of the 1980s cheesiness of Bollywood.  The second story, set in modern day London was pretty interesting.  Unfortunately, it went somewhat unfinished.  Then, the third story went right back to cheesy again.  Bollywood is such a confusing place to have favorites.  When I first started watching Bollywood movies, circa 2004, Saif Ali Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachan, Rani Mukherjee, and a few others were my favorites.  Now, many of them have dropped off and there are new people and there's too many to filter through.  Maybe next time Shahid and Priyanka.",1360368000,,700,5.008695652173913
