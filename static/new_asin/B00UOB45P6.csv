8707739,4,B00UOB45P6,"This is one of those stories that spirals down into chaos, yet ends on a very positive note. It deals with one man's attempts to leave a life of crime and go straight, sonething that's not sorking out so well for him. It highlights how the lure of easy money can derail the best of intentions. Four episodes you can watch in one evening. Riveting! David Morrissey's acting is spot on.",1453507200,,384,4.422535211267606
8707740,4,B00UOB45P6,"A disillusioned cab driver in London is offered a driving job by a 'businessman' (gangster). He gets a nice car and is paid in cash upon the conclusion of each job.

He aspires for a better marriage but their son is in a cult so that is a problem. Then things begin to unravel which happens when company is kept with criminals. Engaging, violent, some swearing. Well acted, interesting to see British life, I opted for subtitle as sometimes the words are not easy to hear.",1452211200,,472,4.488372093023256

8707742,5,B00UOB45P6,"Who could say no to a cash gig driving a cab exclusively for ...a criminal gang?  Vince McKee, portrayed by David Morrissey, can't resist the lure, especially with a less-than-happy home life and a low-paying job driving an assortment of rude, annoying, stingy-tip-giving taxi customers. Life changes drastically when he's in the driver's seat for  the crime boss known as The Horse, played by Colm Meaney. Vince's paydays now come in the form of bills coiled thick as a snake, and just as dangerous. His wife(Claudie Blakeley) is not thrilled by Vince's new careeer, and the more he drives for gang members, the more he realizes he's on a collision course, not a sedate taxi ride. There's no way out for a driver ensnared by a criminal enterprise, and Vince finds the action leaves him almost longing for the days of stingy tippers. This drama is packed with fast-moving plotlines and gritty characterizations...and you'll be rooting for Vince to swap his cab for a dull but safer career path.",1438905600,,994,4.875739644970414
8707743,5,B00UOB45P6,"THE DRIVER is an excellent new thriller starring David Morrissey.  At first I thought this British mini-series might be made available in North America due to Morrissey's recent appearance on The Walking Dead, but after sitting through each nail-biting episode it was apparent that the series is being released here because it is really good and stands on its own merit.

True, it doesn't hurt that Morrissey is now a familiar face over here, but all such speculation about distribution becomes moot when you see him play, utterly convincingly, a Manchester cab driver who makes some bad decisions in his life.  By becoming a driver for a crime boss (played with calculating sadism by Colm Meany, another Brit who has become a familiar face in North America thanks to shows like Hell on Wheels), Morrissey puts his life and his family's life in jeopardy.

The excellent script shows how easy it is for one bad decision to lead to another, and another, much like a domino effect.  It reminds one of Mark Twain's witticism ""If you never lie you never have to remember anything.""

What is particularly attractive about this show is that there is real redemption in the end.  At one time it would have been a given for virtually any show to have a happy, or at least satisfactory, ending.  Today you never know how something will end.  The redemption that plays out in THE DRIVER is a reminder that generally audiences crave a happy ending.  Sure, the show is gritty and violent, but that doesn't mean the audience can't sigh in relief at the end.  Without giving away what actually happens, suffice to say that Morrissey, as the title character, learns the consequences of his choices.

All around an excellent thriller.",1437177600,5,1717,4.802721088435374
8707744,5,B00UOB45P6,Great action movie. David Morrissey is the best actor.,1436227200,2,54,5.111111111111111
8707745,5,B00UOB45P6,"A taxi driver in a go-nowhere job and life thinks he's finally found a way for a little excitement, cash, and betterment. Ask no questions, he's just a driver. But then his boring life becomes action-packed, overwrought with danger and suspense, and the boring is replaced by life-threatening. All 3 episodes are an ongoing miniseries story of a man, his family, and a life that can't go any more wrong. Some really solid acting by veteran stars keeps viewers on the edge of their seat. David Morrissey not only plays the driver role, but he also is an exec. Producer.

SDH Subtitles available.
Episode 1 ==An old mate, now ex-con Colin (Ian Hart), introduces Vince (David Morrissey -""South Riding"") to The Horse (Colm Meaney -""Hell on Wheels"") a gangster boss needing a driver. Better than his Taxi gig? The Driver's home relations with wife Ros (Claudie Blakley -""Lark Rise to Candleford""), daughter Katie (Sacha Parkinson -""The Mill"", ""Mr Selfridge""), and run-away son Tim (Lewis Rainer) is a mess and tanking.
Episode 2 ==Vince & Colin are caught up in a violent act. Vince tries to rectify the situation but only gets in deeper. One bad decision leads to another, and no safe way out.
Episode 3 ==A major burglary is in the works, the cops close in and Vince is caught in the middle, as is his family. A dramatic conclusion to a very intense three hours of viewing.
Make sure you have a full 3 hours of viewing time available, because you will NOT want to pause between episodes.

Is it suspense? Is it thriller? Yes, and yes, immediately from the opening scene.",1432598400,2,1567,4.7153284671532845
