8299459,5,B001ESBP3I,"Larry Long is my great-uncle. He has since passed away, but his legacy as a magnificent instructor will forever carry on as long as their are instructionals like this. I hope that the students who have seen or used this have found it to be beneficial, as this would have pleased him greatly. I found the video to be quite effective in providing basic form as well as his lively guidance to keep in time with the music. He was very passionate in his dance and I'm glad to see that this is available for everyone.",1328227200,,511,4.333333333333333
