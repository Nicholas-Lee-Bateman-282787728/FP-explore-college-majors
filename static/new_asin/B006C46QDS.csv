4983385,3,B006C46QDS,"SO...I do Zumba quite often and I recently lost 30 lbs so I'm getting in better shape, but this is definitely not for beginners.  The moves are quite difficult (especially the plank with knee one because I am recovering from a knee surgery)  With that being said, I will not give up.  I am motivated by Kelly and Jeanette's energy and I will keep at it until I can do it and I start to see results!  Would recommend it still but to people in a little better shape that are ready for definition.  Not sure if I like the B & W version but it is different.",1324252800,5,553,4.083333333333333
4983386,5,B006C46QDS,"I have been doing the Sexy Abs workout for about two weeks. I do it twice a week and follow up with circuit training. I wouldn't recommend this to a beginner, as the moves are a little challenging but with practice doable. Sexy Abs will give you a great abs workout. My abs were on fire. The DVD is shot in black and white, I guess to keep the sexy theme. I am a big fan of Jeanette Jenkins so I really enjoyed the workout, she explains the moves clearly and is very motivating even Kelly motivates you to complete the exercises.

I enjoyed the warm-up session as well as the stretching. The only thing that was annoying to me in the DVD was Kelly Rowland hooting. The workout is short, about 30 mins. so this would be an ideal addition to your workout routine.",1324252800,35,761,4.248275862068965
4983387,5,B006C46QDS,"This video is soo effective and motivating!  Kelly Rowland and Jeanette Jenkins chemistry and energy are amazing!!  It is shot in black and white as well with a modern twist, so it is a great change from the traditional work out videos.  I saw results with my abs within 2 weeks from doing this video!!!!
There are soo many different exercises that you can do with your abs that you will never get bored.",1323993600,2,404,4.4324324324324325
4983388,5,B006C46QDS,"I completed the entire dvd 2 days ago and I am sore.  This workout is a must have. Jeanette's exercises are very effective in targeting the entire abdomen area.  After I finish Jillian's 1-week shred, I want to go back to this work out 3 to 4 times a week because it is a thorough program.  I would do both, but the strength component of 1-week shred also targets the core in an intense way, and I will probably kill myself if I do. I love this sexy ab workout!",1400544000,3,461,4.1
4983389,4,B006C46QDS,"I thought these exercises were great. Many of them are challenging, but definitely attainable if you continue strengthening your abs with the DVD. And seeing Kelly's abs the entire workout keeps you motivated. Her abs look better than the trainer's! But Kelly speaks low at times and sometimes you can't understand what she's saying at the start of the segments. Don't worry, it's not any instruction or anything important that she's saying.",1399680000,,441,5.138888888888889
4983390,4,B006C46QDS,"This is an excellent DVD to help on your abs...It most definitely works them extremely hard, its easy to work out with someone else and not just by yourself",1397174400,,156,4.413793103448276
4983391,4,B006C46QDS,"The workout is really good, read about it in People magazine and they were right that it hurts at first but does work.  The vendor was great to work with, there was a defect in the dvd but they replaced it quickly for me.",1395360000,3,221,4.0227272727272725
4983392,4,B006C46QDS,"It's a decent ab work out and it's nicely divided into smaller chunks--which I like.  However, it is really only an abs work out.  I like the CARDIO SCULP SEXY ABS much better.  More well-rounded and more options.  If you only buy one, choose that one.",1393891200,8,252,4.413043478260869
4983393,5,B006C46QDS,I loved it worked well for me. when I first got it I used it a lot but the exercises the exercises became to easy for me. I'm not sure if it's ready for beginners. I work out at home,1393286400,,182,3.575
4983394,5,B006C46QDS,You definitely have to work into this workout.  It is tough work but a good round of crunches.  I recommend picking a few exercises and working them into normal workout routine.,1392768000,3,177,4.67741935483871
4983395,5,B006C46QDS,"Great exercise DVD!  It is challenging, yet gives you the desire to do it again. It is harder than expected, but that's actually what I wanted and needed. Jeanette knows her craft, and is serious about working out and being fit. Kelly adds a nice friendly and supportive vibe. I am looking forward to the results, which I can tell will be awesome.",1390694400,,347,4.507936507936508
4983396,5,B006C46QDS,"This is wonderful. It really works my abs and will get my back on track if I am consistent. Kelly Rowland does talk alot in the DVD which is pretty annoying. Once I learn to block her out, I'll do the workout more often.",1385424000,3,220,4.0227272727272725
4983397,5,B006C46QDS,"It is a great workout dvd but its to much for me, but i do like it i thought that it would be broken down between abs and cardio not just abs i cant do sit ups that much.",1383868800,,170,3.3846153846153846
4983398,1,B006C46QDS,I was very disappointed with the workout. There are better ab workouts out there but this one isn't one of them. If I could get my money back I would however I opened it so I can't. Don't waste your money on this workout.,1383436800,3,221,4.045454545454546
4983399,5,B006C46QDS,"I have been a fan of Jeanette Jenkins for years and already have the Pilates and Yoga dvd's. I have just purchased
received and completed the Sexy Abs dvd and once again I am impressed with her easy to follow and challenging workout!!!!

All I can say is 'Bring it on Jeanette' You are the best!!!",1375833600,,297,4.303571428571429
4983400,4,B006C46QDS,"I bought this DVD last week. I have done it twice so far and boy is it challenging. The price to me was pretty standard. I spend $20 bucks on less important things, so it wasn't a problem for me. I am a beginner in the AB workouts. I do Zumba and The Firm. Jeanette is focused and keeps a steady pace to instruct while speaking. With these type of exercises, that isn't easy to do. I love the burn and the feeling afterwards. I do feel that the V moves are a bit challenging. I found myself doing most of them and then stopping to rest. I am a work in progress and I know I will get there. I feel fantastic in my body. I have been sore in my stomach. Everything in my upper body feels tight. That screams to me....results! I will recommend this video to anyone. One thing I have learned in any workout, is that, you have to determine what your body can and cannot take. With that said...no pain, no gain! Order this DVD and you be the judge!!!!",1370822400,6,944,4.080645161290323
4983401,5,B006C46QDS,"I received the ab worksout and was a little skeptical, primarily due to the celebrity on the cover.  just thought it was
another marketing/endorsement of a substandard product however after the first workout i was certain this was not the case.
Please keep in mind this is not for beginners and probably should be stated on the cover.  I'm glad I ordered it and will be ordering one for my daughter as well.",1369872000,2,407,4.561643835616438
4983402,3,B006C46QDS,"THis video is a little challenging for beginners! But i do like certain parts of the video. Overall, if you are a beginner  workout person this is not the DVD for you!",1368489600,,167,4.21875
4983403,4,B006C46QDS,"This DVD is not for beginners, bought this for my wife and it kicking her butt. If you really want to get sexy abs ladies then this is your DVD but again I warn you this DVD is tough and there is no beginners section. I'm a man who's in pretty good shape and I have a tough time keeping up with the routines, in the end I like the abs workouts.",1366243200,,344,3.7916666666666665
4983404,4,B006C46QDS,"I bought this for my wife, that loves to work-out... She informed me that the work tape are a plus in her workout tapes libary.",1365897600,,127,4.12
4983405,5,B006C46QDS,This is a great workout video.  I would definitely recommend it! Now I know how Kelly gets her great abs.,1365379200,,105,4.25
4983406,3,B006C46QDS,"It was just OK, Jeanette was very good I have other DVDS by her and I enjoy her on everyone of them. Kelly on the other hand was to silly to me in the type she seemed to me to be very playful don't get me wrong I like Kelly I think that she is a very pretty young lady and I like her style must of the time. Just not in this workout DVD.",1364688000,,337,3.506666666666667
4983407,4,B006C46QDS,Why did they produce this in back and white? They all look silver.  It makes no sense to me.  I did like the workout but the counting got annoying.,1363046400,,147,4.0344827586206895
4983408,4,B006C46QDS,Great workout... if u r a beginner dis is da one u need buy.. l love dis workout video... results will turn out great,1363046400,,117,3.9166666666666665
4983409,2,B006C46QDS,"I'm a beginner and this wasn't really a challenge for me. There were one or two moves that were a little challenging. However, I think this dvd is a good start to get you in the habit of working out. Definately not worth the price either. I guess you're paying for Kelly Rowland's appearance!!!",1361923200,,294,4.462962962962963
4983410,5,B006C46QDS,"I am pleased with the purchase. There was an error in the mailing, but customer service responded promptly and I had my workout dvd in No Time! I really appreciate it and recommend you to Anyone!",1361836800,,195,4.444444444444445
4983411,5,B006C46QDS,I love this video I do it every other day and it's a great workout .i would definitely refer this workout video,1360886400,,111,4.090909090909091
4983412,5,B006C46QDS,the total workout is about 40ish mins. i'm a fitness instructor and i got it for my own abs as well as for ideas for the members of my classes. there were some good combinations and variances on ab moves and i felt it. you do a good amount of the exercises and it doesn't feel rushed. i liked the simple black and white shooting and the music was okay too. the dialogue between kelly and jeanette seemed natural and of course both have nice abs so it was motivation. i would recommend this dvd. i do think it was a little spendy for an ab dvd but perhaps that is because kelly rowland is featured. i would have bought it months sooner had it been cheaper. i finally broke down when i started teaching a core class and just figured it was a worthwhile investment.,1359676800,2,762,4.226027397260274
4983413,2,B006C46QDS,"I was very disappointed in the variety of this workout. I've noticed that in a lot of abs DVDs the exercises can be boringly repetitive, and that's true here as well. I expected something better from Jeanette. I wouldn't even recommend this workout because it's full of crunches (which I really hate) and same old same old moves that didn't define my abs very well.
I did this workout for 30 days along with Self's Bikini Ready Fast DVD. Very disappointing, I'd recommend Jillian's Killer Abs workout and Jessica Smith's Cardio Abs DVDs. Don't waste your money!",1357344000,9,561,4.793814432989691
4983414,5,B006C46QDS,I love the workout my entire torso was sore even my legs were tired. I can't wait to see the results.,1355184000,,101,3.857142857142857
4983415,5,B006C46QDS,great workout for the ABS this was  something i was not ready for and took a couple of weeks to get through this without stopping i would totally recommend for rainy days for something different when your not in the gym,1353888000,,219,4.341463414634147
4983416,5,B006C46QDS,I absolutely love this work out and I feel the burn. It gets easier every time you do it. I lost 11lbs eating right and doing this workout.,1341360000,,139,4.0
4983417,5,B006C46QDS,"This was my first time actually being committed with a workout. Sexy abs does exactly what it's intended to do, it works the heck out of your abs. It's a GREAT  workout for your abs and each chapter has it's own dynamic to it. I love this DVD, the work outs in it, the structure, Jeanette's training style and Kelly Rowland made it feel even more fun to do (besides the pain the next morning haha). Jeanette and Kelly make you want to keep working out, and that's exactly what I needed. Soooo if you're trying to have a consistent ab work out, this is definitely it. :) Good core workout + motivation = this DVD",1339200000,,611,4.267241379310345
4983418,4,B006C46QDS,"this training is very difficult for me. i purchased it honstly because I am a Kelly Rowland fan and I wanted some exercise. It looks easy and fun, but it's very much efficient and challenging. I recommend it...Even if I only did the session twice in 6 months!!",1337212800,,260,4.4375
4983419,4,B006C46QDS,"Love this DVD! However, some of the moves are definetely not for beginners. I had to skip one of the steps because I don't have the best abs strength but hopefully after doing the video for a couples of months I will be able to master all the moves.",1336089600,,249,4.1020408163265305
4983420,5,B006C46QDS,Great work out. Moves a little fast but after a few tries youll get there. It ls challenging and having a matt helps. Truly works after getting through half my abs were on fire.,1334275200,,177,4.235294117647059
4983421,1,B006C46QDS,"This dvd is horrible! The instructor goes way too fast, there is no modifications for any of the exercises and Kelly Rowland's incessant talking and whoo's throughtout the video are distracting & annoying!

This was a complete waste of money and I gave the dvd away, hopefully they will find it more helpful than I did!",1333756800,5,319,4.696428571428571
4983422,5,B006C46QDS,"The DVD arrived so fast. I've been using it for 1 week now (I work M-F 7a-7p, adding working out has been rough) and I feel better (more energetic).  I know I won't see results for a few weeks, but I know I'm on the right path. The DVD is more for the ""Intermediate"" fitness level.  I suggest watching it first, then exercising to it. Also, get a very ""THICK"" exercise mat. Majority of the workout is on the floor.",1332892800,4,414,4.1625
4983423,2,B006C46QDS,"I'm a huge Jeanette Jenkins fan and aside from this one, I own five of her other DVDs. I love her teaching style and her personality - both of which take away that dread factor of working out. For this Sexy Abs DVD, the fact it's shot in black and white gives it that cool factor and as usual, Jeanette is great and her cuing is on point. That said, I just didn't love this one. I think Jeanette would have been better off doing the video alone, minus Kelly Rowland, as she adds nothing useful to the workout - just a bunch of ""woooos!"" and mindless comments. If anything, I found her to be distracting. As for the workout itself, I consider myself intermediate/advanced and I didn't find the workout very challenging. Jeanette did throw some unique moves into the mix but for the most part they were old school (i.e., 100 bicycles in sets of 25) which I have no problem with but when the video ended I felt nothing, really. I still love Jeanette but this one was a miss for me, especially for the price.",1327622400,19,1004,4.317460317460317
4983424,5,B006C46QDS,Just got this today and I love it. I'm not going to lie it is tough but they make it easy to follow. I love how it's many different exercises.,1326067200,,142,3.7666666666666666
4983425,5,B006C46QDS,Jeanette is a fantastic insipirational trainer. This DVD is so easy to follow. Needs no equipment. Just do the moves on a mat or on a towel laid on the floor. I was surprised how effective it is. Get it! You won't be disappointed.,1325980800,18,230,4.25
4983426,5,B006C46QDS,"I am living in the UK so had to order the DVD from [...] as it not available in the UK, which is a real shame :( this DVD is great, Ive been doing it for just over two weeks & now can see my ABS for the first time in years!!! Its pretty intense, but the results you get so quickly was worth every drop of sweat!! Jeanette & Kelly are fantastic together & their enthusiasm really keeps you motivated throughout. Glad I managed to get hold of my copy, great :)",1325376000,12,458,3.935483870967742
4983427,5,B006C46QDS,"This is by far 1 of the best work out video's I have purchased. I live in an area where gym's lack good group classes so I often buy DVD's to help motivate me. This work out is good because you feel as if you are in the room exercising with Jeanette and Kelly so you don't feel alone. To be honest, I could not finish the whole workout, but I like that because it gives me something to work on.  This is the 3rd DVD I purchased from The Hollywood Trainer and once again Jeanette introduced new exercises that really work. More than just your abs are going to get a workout with this video.
I also like the meal plan. I am sure if I follow the meal plan and do the workout 4 times a week  I will be ready to put my bathing suite back on in Feb.",1325203200,4,743,3.8815789473684212
