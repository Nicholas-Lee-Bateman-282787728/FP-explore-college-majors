8048544,5,B0007LPSOK,"Saw these on tv and loved them.  So glad to see they were available on dvd through Amazon.  I got mine, a friend and I watched them, and he had to have a set for himself.  These are really nice, telling things as they were, taking away the myths and showing the real trials the folks went through baack in the 19th century, both the good and the bad.",1273795200,,350,4.043478260869565

8048546,3,B0007LPSOK,Seems like this film lacks in about every area.  It is a documentary and not a good one.  Sort of skims the surface in all areas reviewed.  The narration is weak at best and there are not enough details to make is historically correct.,1168300800,11,235,4.295454545454546
