8122926,2,B000FIGXGW,"Poor Hasmik Papian. She can't seem to get documented in a

halfway decent production of her widely traveled Norma. I

reported a few months ago on a production from Amsterdam,

which had a resoundingly silly backstage ""All About Eve""

plot corresponding with the real one; it seemed to have

been made by a team that spent too much time smoking reefer

in a coffeehouse (hey, it's allowed there).

The latest bungling is billed as ""A Film by Boris

Airapetian,"" which features an all-Armenian cast, along

with Papian, the most renowned being Gegam Grigorian. The

other singers are unrecognizable names. This movie, made on

a video format, rather than film, was shot in and around

ancient Armenian locations.

It's hard to know how to describe this (mostly)

incomprehensible mess. There's absolutely no rhyme or

reason to the directorial concept or editorial decisions

here. But I take the time to share with you my sense of

disbelief. And abject frustration. You will read why at

the end of this review. What could have been.

During the Overture, we see exterior/interior shots of an

opera house with audience arriving, orchestra, curtain

opening, rehearsals. Then, we are taken outside for

Oroveso's opening. During this, we are taken to sudden

nature shots. Then Oroveso's ""What'll I do face."" Then

clips of a storming army, which looked culled from the

movie ""Braveheart.""

The war noises obliterate the music.

Pollione and Flavio come onto the scene with cheap

Italian-movie costumes. The Pollione, looking very old,

paunchy and weatherbeaten. The Flavio, a stunning,

Apollonian young god with a Roman coin profile. Flavio has

a promising voice, but he's cast as Flavio. Grigorian

sounds decent, but aged. Can't lip-sync. The cabaletta

begins its music, then cuts the rest of it to the very end,

with the strangled high C. Can't let the tenor miss his

opportunity.

Norma's first scene takes place not on a dark, moon-lit

night but a beautiful, sunshiny day. The entrance of the

chorus, all beaming with smiles across a bridge onto a

grove, feels like the peasants arriving for the chorus in

""Eugene Onegin."" Lots more cutaways to nature shots. There

are so many split-second edits and zooming shots it gives

you a headache. Psychedelic.

We see Norma briefly standing on a crested rock, arms

spread. A head veil, topped by sparkly little things which

look dimestore quality. For her entire recitative, and for

most of her aria, we only see the back of her head. I kid

you not. The camera races madly around the chorus's heads,

often out of focus. What split-second facial shots you see

of Norma, the lip-synching is appallingly bad (the reason

for shooting the back of her head

and fast cutaways?).

At the beginning of ""Casta Diva,"" Heaven lifts Norma's

mistletoe cutter out of her hands as the chorus watches in

awe as it ascends to the sky and turns into a

crescent-shaped moon. In broad daylight. For the

ascensions on ""A noi volgi,"" a nice effect is having it

echo against the valleys and peaks.

""Fine al rito"" and the cabaletta are cut out completely.

Adalgisa's prelude music is against the village children

playing happily, their laughter obscuring the music, to

numerous cutaways and edits. She sings one line of her

aria: Sacra e la selva...compiuto in rito."" And that's it. It

segues right to the entrance music of her duet with

Pollinator. They sing their duet to some paper mache ""idol""

that moves when Pollione touches it. The Adalgisa looks

like a golden haired Venus. Only the wig is so far back on

her forehead you can see her own hair crown. During this

scene, the ""enemy"" lurks in the forest and purports to

shoot Pollione with bow and arrow...but don't. Again,

numerous cutaways during crucial moments. Wait...there's

Norma watching the two cuckolding her! (Had the director

read the story?)

Pollione's ""Adalgisa, ah Adalgisa"" then...it stops. the

""Vieni in Roma is cut...just a fade out of Pollione at a

Romanesque ruin.

Norma's cave, laden with torches, is impressive. The scene

with the kids and Adalgisa is a relief: it is more

straightforward, and atmospheric, and Papian manages to

look tense, troubled. She looks good here too, long reddish

locks billowing in the wind, like a Classical actress.

Alas, she and the Adalgisa look sooo uncomfortable and out

of kilter miming their own singing, and here, as elsewhere,

the spatial perspective is cartoonishly un-aligned with the

image. The director destroys the intimacy with shots of

Pollione, en-torched, circling the maze of the hallways

around the two, echoing from beyond.

Then; it shows him, while Norma and Adalgisa are at the

climax of their duet, his bumping into a paper-mache idol

concoction, cursing it angrily, and throwing the torch at

it.

The trio goes OK, with Papian impressive in her anger, and

the wind and torches give a harried feel. A great touch:

lighting thunders across a glistening moon.

The act ends with Papian suddenly back in the opera house,

the curtain closing on her prostrate form. I'm not making

this up.

Opening to act 2 atmospheric; though Norma ""thinks"" her

lines rather than sing-syncs them.

Then it goes to Oroveso's scene with chorus. Bored among

the rocks. More nature.

Chorus only. No ""Ah del Tebro.""

Back to the cave. Most of the recit cut, straight to `Deh

con te."" Pollione again eavesdrops the scenes, circling the

hallways again.

The Guerra"" chorus is dizzyingly filmed; Flavio is

slaughtered, while Pollione is brought in. Norma is

outfitted in a blue-sequined adorned gown, with a headpiece

that replicates a peacock.

The Norma-Pollione duet goes well: it at least zeros in

successfully on their tension. But that synching remains

false. Papian, by the way, is in good vocal form

throughout. Her audio performance is more convincing than

the disjointed visuals. (Is this review disjointed? The

film was a good influence.)

The director hides Papian's face during ""Son io,"" missing a

crucial opportunity.

Adalgisa and the kiddies are present, who seem bored.

Adalgisa shields their eyes to protect them from this

debasing shame of mommy, and takes them away.

Then, something astonishing happens. The film suddenly

takes a surprising turn. The drama becomes intensely

moving. The director ceases to screw around; finally, he is

inspired. Grigorian turns impassioned, distraught, remorse

mixed with love; Papian looks anguished, tormented, rapt,

and a grandeur of nobility becomes her. The chorus no

longer look like dunderheads, but react superbly to the

gravity of the situation. Papian's pleas to Oroveso is

poignant, deeply felt. She sings with momentous

conviction. The leading up to the pyre (with a real fire),

and the overlapping of Norma's face through the flames

is brilliantly done. Then you see her spirit conveyed up

from the pyre to the crimson moon. To this is Bellini's

towering score, and when those phenomenal modulations kick

in, at last, this movie brings forth the choked throat and

stinging eyes.

The final scene alone is almost worth the price of the DVD.

What could have been, what could have been!!

We may yet see Papian in another DVD in the role: she was

in a production from Orange that was telecast: supposedly,

this was her finest performance. Let's hope that one is

released, for she deserves a chance to be spotlighted in a

role that she has sung all over the world. I did not care

for her in Detroit two years ago in the role, but I have to

give her unstinting respect for her frequent undertaking of

it - and not being defeated by it; that she lacks the ideal

bel canto (IMO) values in no way underestimates her

considerable accomplishments.",1170979200,12,7733,4.950588235294117
8122927,3,B000FIGXGW,"This is a very, very weird purchase. It is probably one of the weirdest opera productions I have ever seen. Musically the thing is quite good - the orchestra, singers and chorus sound well and are recorded well. And then comes  the film - or, to be precise - the video. Yes, it is shot on videotape. Beautiful scenery, nice costumes, authentic locations, big sets when needed. But then... It is an incredibly poorly filmed (taped) performance. The director seems to be totally absent, as are lighting and camera crew, as well as the editing team. The singers (when they are shown) are miming so poorly it amazes one deeply. For most of the time Norma is not shown at all, only from behind at best. I know it sounds unbelievable, but it is true - throughout her entrance and Casta Diva you can see EVERYTHING else but her! Only twice her face is shown briefly, when she sings the cadenza on ""aaaaa"" - obviously she hadn't memorized the lyrics... later on, however, she is seen. No beautiful actors/actresses here. After being transported indoors (the temple etc), the production looks better, but there are still weird and cheaply produced flashbacks, some copy/pasted shots of chorus and landscape, and even stock footage, probably stolen from some 1950s Hollywood epic.

So what would be my verdict? It has some camp value, if you can appreciate that. It is perhaps better than some high tech modern production, since there is some naive, primitive purity in the way the team struggles to create an authentic atmosphere and traditional narrative. By no means a ""film"", this cheap made-for-TV production grows better once your eyes and mind have grown accustomed to it. When I started to write this review, I hated it. Now, towards the end of Act II, I almost like it. It's totally out of sync and instead of singing, Norma just stands there, but they really put their hearts in it, so you can't be all that annoyed.",1170806400,7,1916,4.7164179104477615
