3924729,5,B002GHCJHW,"For those of you who have watched the Bunnie Theatre movie reenactments on Starz or Angry Alien's website, this DVD needs no introduction.  For those of you who haven't yet discovered these comical masterpieces, you're in for a big treat.  I first came across the reenactments on Starz' website, and then followed them over to Angry Alien's site where I've had many a hearty laugh watching these 30 second mini-movies.  Now we can get all of them on a single DVD and kick back and enjoy them from the comfort of the couch. These bunnie movie's are SO clever, and SO spot-on, you can't help but crack up. Hard.  Get the DVD now, and see for yourself.  And on top of all the reenactments, there's some hilarious special features with Bunnies that you have never before seen, and will thoroughly enjoy.  And the included ""making of"" mini documentary about Jennifer Shiman's creative process is the icing on the cake. She is one creative chick, and it's fun to get inside peek at how she does it!",1262822400,2,992,4.607954545454546
3924730,5,B002GHCJHW,"Had delighted in these great little vignettes of some of the most popular movies. Found them on the 'Angry Alien' productions website where you'll find that many of them were made based on the most popular requests submitted to the site. Did not realize until recently they had been collected and put on DVD. Even tough they are animations, a few might be a 'little much' for younger children.",1262304000,,393,4.7101449275362315
3924731,5,B002GHCJHW,What a treat to own this wonderful collectible DVD. I watched 'It's a Wonderful Life' two hundred sixty consecutive times! Those bunnies are amazing!,1262044800,,149,5.25
3924732,5,B002GHCJHW,"I've been an Angry Alien web page fan for some time and now get to watch their theater on my tv! And, this past weekend, I introduced my nearly-11-year-old niece to ""bunny movies."" (Most of them anyway; had to skip a few because of language. But she'll be 16 soon enough, meaning volume two will probably be available by then.)

Those who began this concept and carried it through should be commended for their vision and cleverness. People, if you are not familiar with bunny theater but you know many of the movies on this dvd, then invest your money and sit back and be amazed by how they nail a movie script in less than one minute.

Purchase is highly recommended!",1260144000,4,669,4.475409836065574
3924733,5,B002GHCJHW,"We just received and watched this DVD, and enjoyed every minute of it!  Aside from the great movie parodies (several we hadn't seen before), we laughed out loud watching the forest creatures auditioning for the 30-second gig. It was hilarious. The mini-documentary of how Shiman creates the bunnies was very interesting, too.

If you saw Jaws, Titanic, or It's a Wonderful Life on GMA, her 30-second movies on Starz! or her website you will love this. If not, you are in for a wonderful treat! A great gift for all lovers of movies!",1256860800,3,532,4.709677419354839
3924734,5,B002GHCJHW,"Jennifer Shiman's 30-second Bunny Theater should be required viewing for all movie lovers! Each 30-second spot is like a tiny little masterpiece, whether the genre is horror, fantasy, comedy or romance. They all are uniquely hilarious and each one really honors the corresponding movie. They all portray the best parts of the films, and Jennifer Shiman even puts her own special twist in some of them, which makes them even better. The 30-Second Bunnies Theatre should be a ""must buy"" for all the movie (and bunny) lovers on your holiday list!",1254787200,3,543,4.978021978021978
3924735,5,B002GHCJHW,"Jennifer Shiman has created an animation masterpiece with her 30-second bunnies.  Her choice of movie nuggets is spot-on, and her passion for her bunnification creations is heartfelt.",1253750400,8,183,5.777777777777778
3924736,5,B002GHCJHW,"This DVD has not even been released yet and I can fully say it is great, most creative thing on the internet. I would recommend this to any one that wants a good laugh, and it can be watched again and again, it's that entertaining, that funny and that great. Buy this!!!",1253145600,9,270,4.211538461538462
3924737,5,B002GHCJHW,"Even the DVD has not been released yet the 30-Second Bunnies are one of my favorite parody videos. The effort that is putten to each of the shortfilms shows the best known scenes of each movie that it is related to. And there are bursts of laughter everytime.

I was once watching War of the Worlds in television and just a few days later i stumpled over the 30-Second re-enacted by bunnies. And i nearly got a fit of laughter. The voices, the rabbit ears on the UFO and the martians themself.

And there are much more fantastic re-enacted Videos.
Even if i know them all, i will go get this DVD. The 30-Second Bunnies can sweeten your day and laughing is good for your health.",1248307200,20,677,4.365079365079365

8369733,4,B002GHCJHW,"Wonderful work, especially the Wizard of Oz! I play this one regularly.",1444694400,,71,5.0
8369734,5,B002GHCJHW,"This is fantastic!  The work that has been put into this production / parody is simply genius!!!  Is there a ""digital version"" for iTunes so I can download it on my iPad?",1421712000,,170,4.28125
8369735,5,B002GHCJHW,"These are incredibly talented (animated) bunnies.  If your sense of humor is slightly askew, their condensed versions of your favorite movies will provide hours of fun.  Not all of the clips are kid-friendly.  So, parental supervision is advised.

Personally, I hope that the bunnies multiply and produce many more DVDs!",1377302400,,320,5.34
8369736,5,B002GHCJHW,"Funny but not for kids! There are MANY rated R movies make into 30 second shorts and this is not for kids. Dh on the other hand though it was very funny in a ""south park"" kinda way.",1359158400,,181,3.789473684210526
8369737,5,B002GHCJHW,The Bunnies are cool and amazing. The long ears jump to the best parts of the movies. I give this DVD 5+ carrots.,1358899200,,113,3.9565217391304346
8369738,4,B002GHCJHW,"I first found the bunnies on a site which recommended other sites to visit during a mid morning break - you know the kind of idle moments during a tea/coffee break, where usually it's a case of stare blankly into space whilst your drink cools down and your biscuit/cookie goes all soggy. Pretty soon i had favourited Angryalien.com and watched with delight as the parodies appeared, each one skillfully crafted to concisly cram the plot of a much loved film into 30 seconds, accompanied by the infectious, high tones of the bunnies.
The DVD (Region 0, so the whole world can enjoy the whimsy) is easy to navigate, the only minor drawback being there isn't a 'play all' option so, after each film you have to go back to the main screen and click down to your next choice.
And it also doesn't contain EVERY parody the bunnies have done, there have been several others done after this DVD was compiled so, unless there's going to be a 'volume 2', it does leave you feeling ever so slightly shortchanged.
But such things are inconsequential if you have a soft spot for the bunnies. this isn't a bad purchase to make.",1299110400,2,1112,4.565
8369739,5,B002GHCJHW,"Funny, imaginative, gory, and cute -- this series was a genius idea. Anyone who enjoys movies and fuzzy creatures will enjoy this!",1286755200,,130,4.954545454545454
8369740,5,B002GHCJHW,"That's about it, really.  I'm a huge fan of these guys since forever.  30-second reenactments of popular movies, all done with bunnies?  How can life get any better?

Enjoy watching your favorite movies broken down, 30 seconds at a time, with the with that only [...] can bring you.",1279584000,,282,4.6938775510204085
8369741,5,B002GHCJHW,"I have to say that after watching a few of these bunny clips, I had to stop the DVD because I was laughing so hard. I had to re-watch some of them because I couldn't hear it, not because of a defect, but because I was cackling like a drunken hyena.

Even the clips based on movies I haven't seen gave me a great laugh (although I've seen most of the movies). If you're having a rough day, week, month, or even year, pop this DVD in and watch it. It's worth it.",1273795200,,460,3.946236559139785
