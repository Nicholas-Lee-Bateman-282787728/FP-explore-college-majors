3049115,5,B0010IOALQ,"The Punky Brewster saga continues for the LAST time in this great Season 4 DVD set!!

This 4-disc set includes all 22 episodes of the 4th & FINAL season (which aired in the spring of 1988) and Punky Brewster (Soleil Moon Frye) has grown and blossomed from the ADORABLE kid who, with her Golden Retriever puppy, Brandon, was found living in vacant apartment, after being deserted by her father, and then abandoned in a shopping center by her mother. Punky has come a long way since then -- since first time she started ""turning the world around"", but that doesn't mean that there's not a thing or two left to learn!

In this LAST season, Punky & her gang deal with crushes, summer camp, bankruptcy, scams & con-artists, illiteracy, child abuse, broken bones, childbirth, and appendicitis, as well as friends, family, and all the other ups & downs of growing up! With all the pandemonium that inevitably ensues from the various scrapes & adventures Punky & her gang get into, this show never fails to entertain & bring on the laughs!

Despite having been deserted by BOTH her parents, over the years, Punky has remained happy & relatively well-adjusted (though, naturally, Punky does have ""abandonment issues"" and at times, the effects of that trauma DOES rear its head. For example, in the episode ""Lost and Found"" in Season 1, ""Urban Fear"" & ""Milk Does a Body Good"" in Season 2, and ""Unhooking Henry"" in Season 3), and that's likely due to both the spunk and strength of Punky's character (""Spunky Punky""), as well as the loving support of her adoptive father Henry Warnimont and her circle of friends, including Cherie Johnson (and her grandmother, Betty), and Margaux Kramer.

Like previous season sets, I LOVE nearly ALL (if not ALL!) the episodes in Season 4. But I'd have to say that my FAVORITE episode this season was ""No, No, We Won't Go"", an episode where Punky & her friends protest a 60% rent increase levied on Cherie & Betty's apartment (which would result in Cherie & Betty having to move out and into an even worse apartment) -- an apartment building owned by Benjamin Kramer, Margaux's father, who is insisting on the rent increase. I LOVE this episode, because it shows the genuinely good heart and loyalty underneath Margaux's snobby, stuck-up and elitist  exterior!

Other favorite episodes include ""The Reading Game"", ""Bad Dog"", ""Poor Margaux"", ""Christmas Hero"" and many more! I LOVE this show SO MUCH and just about the ONLY thing that could have made this show better would be MORE EPISODES! If only this show could have continued on for a 5th or even 6th season, so that there could've been at least a few dozen more episodes! Because 88 are JUST NOT ENOUGH!!

With her spunk, her flair & pizzazz, her kindness, loyalty & compassion for others, and her optimism & happy-go-lucky personality, Punky and her medley of family & friends conquer life lessons and still leave us laughing.

However, even though I LOVE this DVD set, I still DO have one complaint, and a couple of quibbles about it.

First of all, my complaint (and IMHO, the biggest problem) with this set is the HORRIBLE packaging. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATE cardboard DVD boxes, or for that matter, ANY style of DVD cases that involves cardboard!

Rather than a cardboard DVD box holding ANOTHER cardboard box that unfolds and folds up/out (the style used for THIS set, as well as all of the previous Punky Brewster season sets), I much PREFER the single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs (like the DVD case for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7th-Heaven-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000HWZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7th Heaven - The Complete Third Season</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Ninth-Year/dp/B00466H37M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Ninth Year</a>&nbsp;among others!) instead!

I am kind of anal about DVD sets (actually, DVDs & CDs in general!), and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty. But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the significant scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! That is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case, which doesn't get much (if ANY!) edgewear, shelfwear, corner-wear, and/or scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!

In addition, I also have a couple quibbles about this DVD set.

The first is that just like the previous seasons, there is still NO special audio like Dolby Digital, Surround Sound, THX, or DTS. While the picture and sound are still relatively good, considering that this show was made in the 80's, it might have been EVEN BETTER, if it had been remastered with a 21st century audio system.

In that same vein, there is also still NO closed-captioning or subtitles available on this DVD set. As I said in my review for Season 1, 2 & 3, this is a minor quibble, though many other DVD box-sets, at least have this one basic feature. Unfortunately Punky Brewster does not. Not only that, but with some of the other DVD's that do not have closed captions available, they have at least enabled TV captioning, such that if a TV has a closed-captioning feature built in, then it can still be possible to get captions. But with Punky Brewster, this feature has NOT been enabled, so it does not work.

That's a pity, because with a couple exceptions, this DVD set is otherwise so GREAT! I just wish that Shout! Factory had considered those with disabilities or language issues and thought to include closed captions, and maybe even separate language tracks (with subtitles, of course!). Not only so that those who don't speak English, as well as those with hearing impairments (the deaf, the elderly, etc.) can see this wonderful show, but also because sometimes, when Punky or another character is talking quietly or mumbling, its kind of hard to understand, and closed captions would really help to decipher their mumbled and/or softer-spoken dialogue. Naturally, they would need to raise the price a little to cover that, but I, for one would not have minded (and would not mind) paying a little more for those important features when buying a DVD (or especially a DVD box set!). But the DVD manufacturer did not consider the needs of the WIDE & VARIED demographic of people who'd be buying this show, so there are no captions or subtitles on this DVD set. Its a shame, and Shout! Factory should REALLY consider including closed captions, and maybe even separate language tracks (with subtitles, of course!) on all shows, for future releases!

My second quibble is that, with the exception of more episodes of the ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoons, there are NO other Special Features on this DVD set. What's worse is, despite that, incredibly, the DVD manufacturer only released 7 episodes of the cartoon series in this set -- leaving those who are fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Punky-Brewster/dp/630223090X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Punky Brewster</a>&nbsp;1 episode (The Shoe Must Go On) SHORT of owning the COMPLETE animated series!

There are 42 episodes in the animated ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoon series -- 8 episodes of which were included in the Season 1 DVD box-set, 16 episodes which were in the Season 2 set, 10 episodes of which were included in the Season 3 set, and finally 7 of the 8 remaining episodes are included on THIS Season 4 DVD set, leaving ONE episode, ""The Shoe Must Go On"" MISSING!

Its very hard to understand (not to mention AGGRAVATING!) why the DVD manufacturers would leave the the cartoon series INCOMPLETE by only 1 episode instead of just including it on this set (or one of the previous sets) so that those of us who are fans of BOTH Punky Brewster series (the animated version & the ""live-action"" version) could complete their collection of the animated series, the same way that THIS Punky Brewster DVD set completes ALL the episodes of the ""live-action"" version of the series.

If that's not bad enough, the incomplete cartoon episodes are the ONLY ""bonus"" on this DVD set. Not only are there NO interviews of cast members & producers/directors (like there were in the first 2 seasons) but there are also NO other Special Features (bloopers, deleted scenes, episode commentaries, etc.) either! NONE WHATSOEVER!

It is a big disappointment, as those of us who are Punky Brewster fans were really hoping for an interview with the leading actress, Soleil Moon Frye, who played the title character, Punky Brewster on the ""live-action"" series (as well as provided the voice of Punky for the cartoon series) -- especially since previous DVD season sets included interviews with George Gaynes (who played Henry Warnimont) as well as with Cherie Johnson (who played Cherie Johnson) and Ami Foster (who played Margaux Kramer).

So it would have been really nice if the Season 3 DVD set had an interview Casey Ellison (who played Allen Anderson for the first 2 seasons as well as until the 4th episode of this season) and/or Soleil Moon Frye, who are the only 2 main cast members (aside from Susie Garrett [who played Betty Johnson] but sadly, died in 2002) who have not yet been interviewed on any of the season sets. I'm sure that the DVD creators could get a lot more sales, if they just included some of these features which many people (including, but not necessarily, me) consider the whole reason (or at least one of the main reasons) for buying a DVD set.

When people buy DVDs (especially for TV shows), many times its so that they can get special features that they would NOT otherwise be able to get, just from taping the shows off of TV broadcasts. So DVD manufacturers should really take that into consideration, and include at least a few extras to make it worth buying a DVD set. Even cheaper priced DVD sets (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-House/dp/B0006N2F0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full House</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-the-Boss/dp/B0001Z3I1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's the Boss?</a>) have some special features which generally are part of the allure of buying a DVD set. I mean seriously, something, anything would be nice. Deleted scenes, bloopers, trailers, interviews with the cast and crew. Something. Anything. Just some extras to make it worth the expense!

Nevertheless, even with those few issues, Punky Brewster is still TRULY a GEM!!

Its really too bad that they just don't make shows like this anymore. I grew up in the 80's (and early to mid 90s) and this show is an instant blast to my childhood. The 80's had so many WONDERFUL (not to mention mostly family-friendly!) TV shows!

Punky Brewster, Webster, Mr. Belvedere, Perfect Strangers, Who's the Boss?, Full House, Family Matters, Baby Talk, Head of the Class, Family Ties, Growing Pains, Life Goes On, Picket Fences, and more!

Punky Brewster is a MUST for all 80's fans & 80s kids like me. I strongly encourage not only Punky Brewster fans, but ANYONE with young kids, anyone who is planning on having kids someday, or anyone who liked this show and wants to see a wholesome, sweet, and QUALITY ""family-friendly"" show (though admittedly, on occasion, ""Punky Brewster"" CAN get a bit treacly saccharine-sweet) that everyone can enjoy, to buy this set of Punky Brewster! You won't be sorry! I sure wasn't, and I play these DVDs often!

I LOVE PUNKY BREWSTER!

3049125,5,B0010IOALQ,I'm remember being about 8 when this show orginally came out.  This show was great for little girls to watch much different then the shows today. Watched this with my younger sister and we laughed a whole bunch in fact we just wanted to be just like Punky and have Punky Power.  Punky grew up so fast much like all of us.  The best part of course was Henry adopting Punky as his own every though he could have been her grandfather.  What little girl wouldn't want Henry as a father or grandfather.  It was very sad to see this show only last for four seasons I think it could have lasted a little longer.  If you have a young girl defintly buy all four seasons she will cherish it.,1221782400,,681,4.2

3049128,4,B0010IOALQ,"This long awaited (at least for me anyway) conclusion to the Punky Brewster season was exciting. I remember growing up with Punky and her friends during the 80s, and am so excited that I get to re-live those childhood memories.

However, the reason for the four, instead of five, stars, is that I would have liked more special features, especially for the last season. It seems almost unfair that new movies have tons of extras, that expand over an entire disc of special features, sometimes more, and then a season gives you the episodes, and a few cartoon episodes, in this case, but thats it.

Otherwise, I was very happy to finally get the final season to complete my collection.",1207353600,,683,4.683333333333334

3049130,5,B0010IOALQ,If you grew up on Punky Brewster this is a must have video! I wish they didn't cancel the show so soon. Having this as part of your collection is really great. I recommend it!,1206316800,,175,4.0285714285714285
3049131,5,B0010IOALQ,"I grew up with Punky Brewster, which certainly dates me quite a bit. When I saw that the series was available on DVD, I wanted my own daughter to experience ""Punky Power"" and so we have bought every single one.

The fourth season, which is the final season, was totally worth the long wait. My daughter and her step sisters have not put it down once. They absolutely adore Punky and how can they not, she's so incredibly lovable and cute.

The final season continues to take a look at many of life's obstacles and learning experiences in a clean, fun way. One of the most endearing qualities of the television show is that every action has a consequence and is a valuable learning tool for us, as parents.

We own all of the seasons now, and I plan to save them when my children tire of them, for my grand children.

If you loved her the first time around, consider giving your children the chance to know her too. My friends children always leave here wanting the series on DVD too.",1206057600,,983,4.384615384615385
3049132,5,B0010IOALQ,"I was a bit disappointed when only a small part of the camp episode was featured on the DVD, if you notice in the end credits for that episode, some of the scenes were cut out. I don't know if this was an accident or not, but I don't remember back that far to know for sure.

 In any case, I have all four seasons, my favorite show when I was in 1st grade....and still is one of my favorites. I hate to say it but I related to Punky more than most kids, my mother abandoned me too when I was 6 and I was adopted my grandparents, never knew my dad. So watching it today really hits a nerve and quite a few episodes make me cry.

But old or young you have to admit there was no other show, or girl quite like her.",1205107200,2,711,3.82312925170068
3049133,5,B0010IOALQ,"Like many other Punky fans, I'm thrilled to see the final season finally coming to DVD. After all there was alot of speculation that shout factory lost the rights and we may never see this final season. Thankfully they still do have the rights and we will see this final season (complete with more punky cartoons).

This final season features 22 episodes (finishing the complete 88 of the series). The final episode titles are:

The Nun's Story
Crushed
Going to Camp
Poor Margaux
Brandon's Commercial
Passed Away at Punky's Place
Christmas Hero
See You in Court
Radio Daze
Aunt Larnese Is Coming to Town
Dear Diary
The Reading Game
Ouch
No No, We Won't Go
Bad Dog
Vice Versa
Wimped Out
One Plus Tutor is Three
The Dilemma
What's Your Sign?
Wedding Bells for Brandon

In this season, Punky starts getting interested in boys (and experiences her first crush, first kiss, and dating delemas). One such episode ""going to camp"" has Punky, Margaux, and cherie experience fun, tricks and puppy love at summer camp.

This final season also has such memorable episodes as ""see you in court"" (Betty crashes the bull horn car) and ""passed away"" in which Punky and Cherie get into a tangle when a customer passes out at her restraunt (punky's place).

I'm a bit dissapointed that Soleil didn't do an interview for the final season, but Shout Factory did a great job with all these DVD's, which are unedited.

There are 42 episodes in the animated series. 8 were released in in the Season 1 box set, 16 were released in the Season 2 box set, 10 were released in the Season 3 box set - and like I said before 7 of the remaining 8 cartoons are included in the Season 4 set.

I have Seasons 1-3 and now my collection will be complete.  In this season, we see appearances by Chad Allen and hopefully Jonathan Brandis, among others.  As of now, I only have a few episodes from this season that I taped off the TV and I am eargerly ancticipating to see more.

I highly recommend this if you're a fan of Punky Brewster or who are fans of shows like Silver Spoons, Growing Pains, Who's the Boss, Family Matters, etc.  Thank you, Shout Factory, for making my collection complete.",1199664000,,638,4.552631578947368
3049137,5,B0010IOALQ,"Can't wait to see the fourth & last season of PUNKY BREWSTER. I always loved this show. Like I said on season's 3 review,this season was never viewed here in P.R. but dubbed in spanish in late 90's & it didn't cause any impact on viewers here cause people got use to the 2 pony tails colorful girlie PUNKY BREWSTER. On season 3 & 4 she still was colorful but more mature, but I still love the show & I am very overwhelmed that it's finally gonna be release on dvd after almost 2 years since season 3.
This is the most unforgettable since the last episode is Brandon's wedding to Brenda!!! Weird but very beautiful finale for the show!!",1198713600,,635,4.3
3049138,4,B0010IOALQ,"Although the considerable delay between this DVD set and Season 3 (which was released well over a year ago, in July 2006) was enough to concern some people, the fourth and final season of ""Punky Brewster"" will officially put hard-core fans at ease! We've had to wait almost two years to get this, but now that it's been announced for February 26 (right around Valentine's Day!) there's plenty to look forward to.

""Punky"" certainly has maintained a solid fan base over the years, with plenty of grown adults eager to revisit the episodes, as well as legions of contemporary kids, whose parents can be assured that each show is thirty minutes of innocent, lighthearted fluff. Of course, those adults who loved the show as children will be hard-pressed to watch it now without cringing a little at the shameless sap packed into every episode. In addition, the plot (although entirely sweet) has very little plausibility, when you consider that it involves a girl abandoned by both of her parents at the age of eight, a lifelong bachelor who is at or above the age of sixty, who randomly comes across her and takes on the responsibility of adopting her, and apparently, Punky has no other living relatives whatsoever. On top of that, there seems to be zero emotional trauma on Punky's part as she enters adolescence without the guidance of her parents, and aside from a couple boyfriend woes here and there, the kid doesn't have a care in the world. Let's just say that although childhood abandonment is hardly a rarity in today's world, you'd be hard-pressed to find a child in that situation who is as optimistic and well-adjusted as Miss Punky Brewster, especially when you remember that she is now entering those difficult female teen years, but is still happy as ever. Still, it's not the kind of show that's meant to be taken that seriously, and in light of the trash that reigns over the television screens today, it's nice to look back on the days when people actually didn't mind taking the time to create real shows with a message worth telling. The cynics out there can have a field day with this particular show, but it won't do much good, because it's a sweet, deliciously cheesy example of children's programming, and ""Punky Brewster"" is not afraid to be what it is.

While seasons 1, 2, and 3 focused on Punky's ultra-loving relationship with adoptive father Henry, Season 4 strays from that a bit to depict 11-year-old Punky's more recent priorities, which include boys and friends. Remember when she couldn't stand even fathoming a romantic relationship with a guy, and she even went so far as to punch a little boy in Season 1 when he wanted to be her ""male friend?"" Well, to accommodate the classic 80-degree turn that takes place with many pre-teens, that all changes as Punky develops passionate crushes left and right, whether it's a handsome boy from summer camp, a gorgeous handyman who is twice her age, or two hunks that she accompanies separately to the same movie theater (a memorable episode that finds Punky constantly darting from one theater to another, as best pal Cherie documents the whole thing on videotape). Of course, there's more to Punky than just her newfound ""boy nutty"" ways this season. She winds up in the hospital twice, helps deliver a baby in an elevator, struggles to help her wealthy friend Margaux through a financial crisis (did you ever think that would happen?) and watches her beloved dog Brandon tie the knot with a beautiful female dog in the finale episode. In retrospect, it was a rather dumb way for the writers to close out the series, but on the other hand, the whimsical goofiness of it all is pretty much classic Punky Brewster.

As a proud owner of the first three seasons, I am very excited about this upcoming release, and I can't wait to round out my collection in February. There's no doubt that Soleil Moon Frye's amazing, unprecedented performance in the title role has worked wonders in making this a guilty pleasure for thousands of fans around the world. Shout Factory has done a nice job of bringing the episodes to DVD. This set will look just the same as the other three, except the color is now yellow, and along with the sturdy packaging and a nice visual transfer (the episodes look great to me, no visible graininess or anything like that), a generous helping of the ""It's Punky Brewster!"" cartoon episodes have been a great way to top off the DVDs. We have also received interviews from Cherie Johnson (as herself) and Ami Foster (as Margaux Kramer) in past releases, and although I don't think any interviews have been planned for this final set, it would have been nice to get something from Ms. Soleil herself. Either way, though, I am satisfied with the quality of these DVD collections. As a 22-year-old fan, there are times when I can't ignore the fact that the show is undeniably corny, but when the mood hits you just right, it's fun to enjoy a couple episodes, and as far as I'm concerned, February 26 can't come soon enough!",1197936000,16,5014,4.7214611872146115

3283612,5,B0010IOALQ,"The Punky Brewster saga continues for the LAST time in this great Season 4 DVD set!!

This 4-disc set includes all 22 episodes of the 4th & FINAL season (which aired in the spring of 1988) and Punky Brewster (Soleil Moon Frye) has grown and blossomed from the ADORABLE kid who, with her Golden Retriever puppy, Brandon, was found living in vacant apartment, after being deserted by her father, and then abandoned in a shopping center by her mother. Punky has come a long way since then -- since first time she started ""turning the world around"", but that doesn't mean that there's not a thing or two left to learn!

In this LAST season, Punky & her gang deal with crushes, summer camp, bankruptcy, scams & con-artists, illiteracy, child abuse, broken bones, childbirth, and appendicitis, as well as friends, family, and all the other ups & downs of growing up! With all the pandemonium that inevitably ensues from the various scrapes & adventures Punky & her gang get into, this show never fails to entertain & bring on the laughs!

Despite having been deserted by BOTH her parents, over the years, Punky has remained happy & relatively well-adjusted (though, naturally, Punky does have ""abandonment issues"" and at times, the effects of that trauma DOES rear its head. For example, in the episode ""Lost and Found"" in Season 1, ""Urban Fear"" & ""Milk Does a Body Good"" in Season 2, and ""Unhooking Henry"" in Season 3), and that's likely due to both the spunk and strength of Punky's character (""Spunky Punky""), as well as the loving support of her adoptive father Henry Warnimont and her circle of friends, including Cherie Johnson (and her grandmother, Betty), and Margaux Kramer.

Like previous season sets, I LOVE nearly ALL (if not ALL!) the episodes in Season 4. But I'd have to say that my FAVORITE episode this season was ""No, No, We Won't Go"", an episode where Punky & her friends protest a 60% rent increase levied on Cherie & Betty's apartment (which would result in Cherie & Betty having to move out and into an even worse apartment) -- an apartment building owned by Benjamin Kramer, Margaux's father, who is insisting on the rent increase. I LOVE this episode, because it shows the genuinely good heart and loyalty underneath Margaux's snobby, stuck-up and elitist  exterior!

Other favorite episodes include ""The Reading Game"", ""Bad Dog"", ""Poor Margaux"", ""Christmas Hero"" and many more! I LOVE this show SO MUCH and just about the ONLY thing that could have made this show better would be MORE EPISODES! If only this show could have continued on for a 5th or even 6th season, so that there could've been at least a few dozen more episodes! Because 88 are JUST NOT ENOUGH!!

With her spunk, her flair & pizzazz, her kindness, loyalty & compassion for others, and her optimism & happy-go-lucky personality, Punky and her medley of family & friends conquer life lessons and still leave us laughing.

However, even though I LOVE this DVD set, I still DO have one complaint, and a couple of quibbles about it.

First of all, my complaint (and IMHO, the biggest problem) with this set is the HORRIBLE packaging. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATE cardboard DVD boxes, or for that matter, ANY style of DVD cases that involves cardboard!

Rather than a cardboard DVD box holding ANOTHER cardboard box that unfolds and folds up/out (the style used for THIS set, as well as all of the previous Punky Brewster season sets), I much PREFER the single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs (like the DVD case for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7th-Heaven-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000HWZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7th Heaven - The Complete Third Season</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Ninth-Year/dp/B00466H37M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Ninth Year</a>&nbsp;among others!) instead!

I am kind of anal about DVD sets (actually, DVDs & CDs in general!), and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty. But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the significant scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! That is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case, which doesn't get much (if ANY!) edgewear, shelfwear, corner-wear, and/or scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!

In addition, I also have a couple quibbles about this DVD set.

The first is that just like the previous seasons, there is still NO special audio like Dolby Digital, Surround Sound, THX, or DTS. While the picture and sound are still relatively good, considering that this show was made in the 80's, it might have been EVEN BETTER, if it had been remastered with a 21st century audio system.

In that same vein, there is also still NO closed-captioning or subtitles available on this DVD set. As I said in my review for Season 1, 2 & 3, this is a minor quibble, though many other DVD box-sets, at least have this one basic feature. Unfortunately Punky Brewster does not. Not only that, but with some of the other DVD's that do not have closed captions available, they have at least enabled TV captioning, such that if a TV has a closed-captioning feature built in, then it can still be possible to get captions. But with Punky Brewster, this feature has NOT been enabled, so it does not work.

That's a pity, because with a couple exceptions, this DVD set is otherwise so GREAT! I just wish that Shout! Factory had considered those with disabilities or language issues and thought to include closed captions, and maybe even separate language tracks (with subtitles, of course!). Not only so that those who don't speak English, as well as those with hearing impairments (the deaf, the elderly, etc.) can see this wonderful show, but also because sometimes, when Punky or another character is talking quietly or mumbling, its kind of hard to understand, and closed captions would really help to decipher their mumbled and/or softer-spoken dialogue. Naturally, they would need to raise the price a little to cover that, but I, for one would not have minded (and would not mind) paying a little more for those important features when buying a DVD (or especially a DVD box set!). But the DVD manufacturer did not consider the needs of the WIDE & VARIED demographic of people who'd be buying this show, so there are no captions or subtitles on this DVD set. Its a shame, and Shout! Factory should REALLY consider including closed captions, and maybe even separate language tracks (with subtitles, of course!) on all shows, for future releases!

My second quibble is that, with the exception of more episodes of the ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoons, there are NO other Special Features on this DVD set. What's worse is, despite that, incredibly, the DVD manufacturer only released 7 episodes of the cartoon series in this set -- leaving those who are fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Punky-Brewster/dp/630223090X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Punky Brewster</a>&nbsp;1 episode (The Shoe Must Go On) SHORT of owning the COMPLETE animated series!

There are 42 episodes in the animated ""It's Punky Brewster"" cartoon series -- 8 episodes of which were included in the Season 1 DVD box-set, 16 episodes which were in the Season 2 set, 10 episodes of which were included in the Season 3 set, and finally 7 of the 8 remaining episodes are included on THIS Season 4 DVD set, leaving ONE episode, ""The Shoe Must Go On"" MISSING!

Its very hard to understand (not to mention AGGRAVATING!) why the DVD manufacturers would leave the the cartoon series INCOMPLETE by only 1 episode instead of just including it on this set (or one of the previous sets) so that those of us who are fans of BOTH Punky Brewster series (the animated version & the ""live-action"" version) could complete their collection of the animated series, the same way that THIS Punky Brewster DVD set completes ALL the episodes of the ""live-action"" version of the series.

If that's not bad enough, the incomplete cartoon episodes are the ONLY ""bonus"" on this DVD set. Not only are there NO interviews of cast members & producers/directors (like there were in the first 2 seasons) but there are also NO other Special Features (bloopers, deleted scenes, episode commentaries, etc.) either! NONE WHATSOEVER!

It is a big disappointment, as those of us who are Punky Brewster fans were really hoping for an interview with the leading actress, Soleil Moon Frye, who played the title character, Punky Brewster on the ""live-action"" series (as well as provided the voice of Punky for the cartoon series) -- especially since previous DVD season sets included interviews with George Gaynes (who played Henry Warnimont) as well as with Cherie Johnson (who played Cherie Johnson) and Ami Foster (who played Margaux Kramer).

So it would have been really nice if the Season 3 DVD set had an interview Casey Ellison (who played Allen Anderson for the first 2 seasons as well as until the 4th episode of this season) and/or Soleil Moon Frye, who are the only 2 main cast members (aside from Susie Garrett [who played Betty Johnson] but sadly, died in 2002) who have not yet been interviewed on any of the season sets. I'm sure that the DVD creators could get a lot more sales, if they just included some of these features which many people (including, but not necessarily, me) consider the whole reason (or at least one of the main reasons) for buying a DVD set.

When people buy DVDs (especially for TV shows), many times its so that they can get special features that they would NOT otherwise be able to get, just from taping the shows off of TV broadcasts. So DVD manufacturers should really take that into consideration, and include at least a few extras to make it worth buying a DVD set. Even cheaper priced DVD sets (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-House/dp/B0006N2F0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full House</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-the-Boss/dp/B0001Z3I1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's the Boss?</a>) have some special features which generally are part of the allure of buying a DVD set. I mean seriously, something, anything would be nice. Deleted scenes, bloopers, trailers, interviews with the cast and crew. Something. Anything. Just some extras to make it worth the expense!

Nevertheless, even with those few issues, Punky Brewster is still TRULY a GEM!!

Its really too bad that they just don't make shows like this anymore. I grew up in the 80's (and early to mid 90s) and this show is an instant blast to my childhood. The 80's had so many WONDERFUL (not to mention mostly family-friendly!) TV shows!

Punky Brewster, Webster, Mr. Belvedere, Perfect Strangers, Who's the Boss?, Full House, Family Matters, Baby Talk, Head of the Class, Family Ties, Growing Pains, Life Goes On, Picket Fences, and more!

Punky Brewster is a MUST for all 80's fans & 80s kids like me. I strongly encourage not only Punky Brewster fans, but ANYONE with young kids, anyone who is planning on having kids someday, or anyone who liked this show and wants to see a wholesome, sweet, and QUALITY ""family-friendly"" show (though admittedly, on occasion, ""Punky Brewster"" CAN get a bit treacly saccharine-sweet) that everyone can enjoy, to buy this set of Punky Brewster! You won't be sorry! I sure wasn't, and I play these DVDs often!

The best part of course was Henry adopting Punky as his own every though he could have been her grandfather.  What little girl wouldn't want Henry as a father or grandfather.

3283625,4,B0010IOALQ,"This long awaited (at least for me anyway) conclusion to the Punky Brewster season was exciting. I remember growing up with Punky and her friends during the 80s, and am so excited that I get to re-live those childhood memories.

However, the reason for the four, instead of five, stars, is that I would have liked more special features, especially for the last season. It seems almost unfair that new movies have tons of extras, that expand over an entire disc of special features, sometimes more, and then a season gives you the episodes, and a few cartoon episodes, in this case, but thats it.

Otherwise, I was very happy to finally get the final season to complete my collection.",1207353600,,683,4.683333333333334

3283628,5,B0010IOALQ,"I grew up with Punky Brewster, which certainly dates me quite a bit. When I saw that the series was available on DVD, I wanted my own daughter to experience ""Punky Power"" and so we have bought every single one.

The fourth season, which is the final season, was totally worth the long wait. My daughter and her step sisters have not put it down once. They absolutely adore Punky and how can they not, she's so incredibly lovable and cute.

The final season continues to take a look at many of life's obstacles and learning experiences in a clean, fun way. One of the most endearing qualities of the television show is that every action has a consequence and is a valuable learning tool for us, as parents.

We own all of the seasons now, and I plan to save them when my children tire of them, for my grand children.

If you loved her the first time around, consider giving your children the chance to know her too. My friends children always leave here wanting the series on DVD too.",1206057600,,983,4.384615384615385
3283629,5,B0010IOALQ,"I was a bit disappointed when only a small part of the camp episode was featured on the DVD, if you notice in the end credits for that episode, some of the scenes were cut out. I don't know if this was an accident or not, but I don't remember back that far to know for sure.

 In any case, I have all four seasons, my favorite show when I was in 1st grade....and still is one of my favorites. I hate to say it but I related to Punky more than most kids, my mother abandoned me too when I was 6 and I was adopted my grandparents, never knew my dad. So watching it today really hits a nerve and quite a few episodes make me cry.

But old or young you have to admit there was no other show, or girl quite like her.",1205107200,2,711,3.82312925170068
3283630,5,B0010IOALQ,"Like many other Punky fans, I'm thrilled to see the final season finally coming to DVD. After all there was alot of speculation that shout factory lost the rights and we may never see this final season. Thankfully they still do have the rights and we will see this final season (complete with more punky cartoons).

This final season features 22 episodes (finishing the complete 88 of the series). The final episode titles are:

The Nun's Story
Crushed
Going to Camp
Poor Margaux
Brandon's Commercial
Passed Away at Punky's Place
Christmas Hero
See You in Court
Radio Daze
Aunt Larnese Is Coming to Town
Dear Diary
The Reading Game
Ouch
No No, We Won't Go
Bad Dog
Vice Versa
Wimped Out
One Plus Tutor is Three
The Dilemma
What's Your Sign?
Wedding Bells for Brandon

In this season, Punky starts getting interested in boys (and experiences her first crush, first kiss, and dating delemas). One such episode ""going to camp"" has Punky, Margaux, and cherie experience fun, tricks and puppy love at summer camp.

This final season also has such memorable episodes as ""see you in court"" (Betty crashes the bull horn car) and ""passed away"" in which Punky and Cherie get into a tangle when a customer passes out at her restraunt (punky's place).

I'm a bit dissapointed that Soleil didn't do an interview for the final season, but Shout Factory did a great job with all these DVD's, which are unedited.

A must have series, now complete!",1201132800,6,1430,4.72289156626506

There are 42 episodes in the animated series. 8 were released in in the Season 1 box set, 16 were released in the Season 2 box set, 10 were released in the Season 3 box set - and like I said before 7 of the remaining 8 cartoons are included in the Season 4 set.

I have Seasons 1-3 and now my collection will be complete.  In this season, we see appearances by Chad Allen and hopefully Jonathan Brandis, among others.  As of now, I only have a few episodes from this season that I taped off the TV and I am eargerly ancticipating to see more.

I highly recommend this if you're a fan of Punky Brewster or who are fans of shows like Silver Spoons, Growing Pains, Who's the Boss, Family Matters, etc.  Thank you, Shout Factory, for making my collection complete.",1199664000,,638,4.552631578947368
3283634,5,B0010IOALQ,"Can't wait to see the fourth & last season of PUNKY BREWSTER. I always loved this show. Like I said on season's 3 review,this season was never viewed here in P.R. but dubbed in spanish in late 90's & it didn't cause any impact on viewers here cause people got use to the 2 pony tails colorful girlie PUNKY BREWSTER. On season 3 & 4 she still was colorful but more mature, but I still love the show & I am very overwhelmed that it's finally gonna be release on dvd after almost 2 years since season 3.
This is the most unforgettable since the last episode is Brandon's wedding to Brenda!!! Weird but very beautiful finale for the show!!",1198713600,,635,4.3
3283635,4,B0010IOALQ,"Although the considerable delay between this DVD set and Season 3 (which was released well over a year ago, in July 2006) was enough to concern some people, the fourth and final season of ""Punky Brewster"" will officially put hard-core fans at ease! We've had to wait almost two years to get this, but now that it's been announced for February 26 (right around Valentine's Day!) there's plenty to look forward to.

""Punky"" certainly has maintained a solid fan base over the years, with plenty of grown adults eager to revisit the episodes, as well as legions of contemporary kids, whose parents can be assured that each show is thirty minutes of innocent, lighthearted fluff. Of course, those adults who loved the show as children will be hard-pressed to watch it now without cringing a little at the shameless sap packed into every episode. In addition, the plot (although entirely sweet) has very little plausibility, when you consider that it involves a girl abandoned by both of her parents at the age of eight, a lifelong bachelor who is at or above the age of sixty, who randomly comes across her and takes on the responsibility of adopting her, and apparently, Punky has no other living relatives whatsoever. On top of that, there seems to be zero emotional trauma on Punky's part as she enters adolescence without the guidance of her parents, and aside from a couple boyfriend woes here and there, the kid doesn't have a care in the world. Let's just say that although childhood abandonment is hardly a rarity in today's world, you'd be hard-pressed to find a child in that situation who is as optimistic and well-adjusted as Miss Punky Brewster, especially when you remember that she is now entering those difficult female teen years, but is still happy as ever. Still, it's not the kind of show that's meant to be taken that seriously, and in light of the trash that reigns over the television screens today, it's nice to look back on the days when people actually didn't mind taking the time to create real shows with a message worth telling. The cynics out there can have a field day with this particular show, but it won't do much good, because it's a sweet, deliciously cheesy example of children's programming, and ""Punky Brewster"" is not afraid to be what it is.

While seasons 1, 2, and 3 focused on Punky's ultra-loving relationship with adoptive father Henry, Season 4 strays from that a bit to depict 11-year-old Punky's more recent priorities, which include boys and friends. Remember when she couldn't stand even fathoming a romantic relationship with a guy, and she even went so far as to punch a little boy in Season 1 when he wanted to be her ""male friend?"" Well, to accommodate the classic 80-degree turn that takes place with many pre-teens, that all changes as Punky develops passionate crushes left and right, whether it's a handsome boy from summer camp, a gorgeous handyman who is twice her age, or two hunks that she accompanies separately to the same movie theater (a memorable episode that finds Punky constantly darting from one theater to another, as best pal Cherie documents the whole thing on videotape). Of course, there's more to Punky than just her newfound ""boy nutty"" ways this season. She winds up in the hospital twice, helps deliver a baby in an elevator, struggles to help her wealthy friend Margaux through a financial crisis (did you ever think that would happen?) and watches her beloved dog Brandon tie the knot with a beautiful female dog in the finale episode. In retrospect, it was a rather dumb way for the writers to close out the series, but on the other hand, the whimsical goofiness of it all is pretty much classic Punky Brewster.

As a proud owner of the first three seasons, I am very excited about this upcoming release, and I can't wait to round out my collection in February. There's no doubt that Soleil Moon Frye's amazing, unprecedented performance in the title role has worked wonders in making this a guilty pleasure for thousands of fans around the world. Shout Factory has done a nice job of bringing the episodes to DVD. This set will look just the same as the other three, except the color is now yellow, and along with the sturdy packaging and a nice visual transfer (the episodes look great to me, no visible graininess or anything like that), a generous helping of the ""It's Punky Brewster!"" cartoon episodes have been a great way to top off the DVDs. We have also received interviews from Cherie Johnson (as herself) and Ami Foster (as Margaux Kramer) in past releases, and although I don't think any interviews have been planned for this final set, it would have been nice to get something from Ms. Soleil herself. Either way, though, I am satisfied with the quality of these DVD collections. As a 22-year-old fan, there are times when I can't ignore the fact that the show is undeniably corny, but when the mood hits you just right, it's fun to enjoy a couple episodes, and as far as I'm concerned, February 26 can't come soon enough!",1197936000,16,5014,4.7214611872146115
