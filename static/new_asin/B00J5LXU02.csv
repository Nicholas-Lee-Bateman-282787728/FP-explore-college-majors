6336092,2,B00J5LXU02,as dee said $2.99 better lol even maybe $1.99 - i was lured into this movie by a 85% rotten tomatoes rating ... the documentary style filming was not to my liking.  The special effects are good though,1396656000,,200,4.2631578947368425
6336093,3,B00J5LXU02,"The movie is a Vampire movie, to put it best.  Its filmed from one persons perspective in a kind of documentary fashion.  I kind of liked the interesting view on vampires, but I think there is only so many ways to spin the blood thirsty.  It was just OK.  If given the chance to rethink my rental, I would wait for it to be on the $2.99 rental.",1396569600,3,344,4.014705882352941

6336165,4,B00J5LXU02,"I am not a fan of shaking camera blog movies, but I really enjoyed this one. Hope they make another one to show Cliff's experience, then go on to travel around the world together.  Great post-modern vampire story. Two youngbloods who have to learn the ropes together. Great acting. Good scary parts, a few ""gotcha's"" and a good ending. Despite the low-budget blogger style video, it was a good story, good actors, and made me want more.",1526256000,,436,4.662337662337662
6336166,3,B00J5LXU02,"This movie was so much better than I expected - thought I'd be turning it off in 10 minutes like so many other Amazon-movies-I've-never-heard-of. Really good writing, directing, and production values. I think it was let down by the score because it was never as scary as I wanted it to be. Definitely worth watching though.",1525824000,,323,4.785714285714286
6336167,2,B00J5LXU02,"I love vamp movies.  The effects and acting were really quite good, but the filming missed the mark, due to the style used being shaky and distorted making it very difficult to follow.  What a shame, this could have been a 4 star rating if recorded in a professional manner.",1525651200,,274,4.46

6336171,3,B00J5LXU02,I watched this movie not knowing what it's about at all. I'm not really a vampire person. They just don't scare me so this movie wasn't scary in the slightest. It was shot well and it was interesting for a vampire movie. It just wasn't my cup of tea.,1523664000,,250,4.122448979591836
6336172,4,B00J5LXU02,"I enjoyed this movie. I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging it was.  It got a little corny in some places, but if you like The Blair Witch Project and you can suspend reality while you are watching it, you will enjoy it, too.",1523404800,,230,4.2272727272727275

6336225,3,B00J5LXU02,"It's OK for my taste in movies. But, if you like Vampires, it's for you. They were able to make a movie that looked and sounded like it had a much larger budget.",1522800000,,161,3.909090909090909
6336226,4,B00J5LXU02,"I'm pretty damn impressed with this movie! I did not read the description so that I would be more surprised and that really helped! I really felt for these characters, the scares ACTUALLY made me jump (which is usually impossible) and the acting is great. Very good found footage horror.",1522022400,,287,4.76
6336227,4,B00J5LXU02,"I'm not a fan of Blair Witch style ""we're too stupid to turn the camera off and save ourselves"" films. But I like Afflicted. Although the story isn't original, it's told in a very good way to the extent I'd love to see a sequel. There's some lore presented in the film that's a bit different from similar films of this type that would be nice to explore. The acting is good too and the chase scenes are worthy of being used as examples in a film class. Give Afflicted a shot, you could do much worse on Amazon Prime Video.",1521849600,,522,4.178217821782178

6336230,4,B00J5LXU02,"This a surprisingly good movie! I usually don't like films that are shot like this, but this one was so captivating that you don't really even notice it. It's not like all the other vampire movies.it was definitely unique and we'll put together. Definitely worth the time to take a look!",1520035200,,287,4.647058823529412
6336231,4,B00J5LXU02,I really liked it.  The slightly derivative plot beats took it down a star but it was definitely enjoyable horror fare.  Recommended for a Friday night watch!,1519862400,,158,4.814814814814815

6336264,3,B00J5LXU02,"It was okay, Definitely not something I would watch again. It was predictable from the beginning and I almost didn't finish it because I was able to guess the ending. I did like the idea of the movie, hence the reason I watched it, but I was sorely disappointed 1/3 of the way in.",1518566400,,280,4.203703703703703

6336296,4,B00J5LXU02,For a low budget Dracula/Blair Witch type of thing it is not a bad film. I am glad watched it and was probably won over by the actors who were actually not bad.,1514505600,,160,3.878787878787879
6336297,5,B00J5LXU02,Is just thrilling to watch,1513900800,,26,4.4
6336298,4,B00J5LXU02,"When I started watching the movie, I really didn't read anything about its subject - I was expecting more of a contagion/virus movie than a modern Vampire story.

That said, I really enjoyed a (to me anyway) unique story of a man's descent into vampirism that doesn't romanticize the topic beyond a one night stand. The jump scenes were fun - I could feel it coming but they startled me anyway, especially the one where we really see the beast coming out and that pin-point pupil effect when the camera light hits his eyes! The special effects were minimal and more conventional - make up artistry and guide wires to let the Vampires leap incredible heights. Nothing too flashy, a lot of the thrills and apprehension comes from good use of lighting (or the lack thereof).

I enjoyed the documentary-style approach following the two friends and kind of experiencing what was happening almost in the middle of them, but could have done without as much of the shakey-jerky camera work.",1513728000,,982,4.770588235294118

6336302,5,B00J5LXU02,"Such a great movie.  Loved the cross culture integration.  I usually don't like the ""blair witch project"" type of filming and still don't, but the acting, storyline, and comedy in this movie was really enjoyable to watch and the homemade effect, in my opinion, added to the experience.  Thanks!",1512259200,,294,4.959183673469388
6336303,2,B00J5LXU02,"This 'mockumentary' film gets 2starz because the concept wasn't the usual vampire schtick. But I detest & must protest the nauseating aspect of the camera in constant motion gave me a headache. Seriously. I'll admit some of the special f/x were good, but again, could not enjoy them because of the jiggling motion of the cameras. I'd grade this a Low Budget ""C"" Movie. Sorry, but didn't even finish the movie...hope bite-boy finds Audrey!",1511136000,,438,4.9324324324324325
6336324,5,B00J5LXU02,"Wow! So much better than I anticipated.  I was completely transfixed once things got going, shall we say.  I loved the sort of documentary/understated style of camera work and the way an already interesting story is used to draw you into one suddenly bizarre and unexpected.  The acting was excellent, and the story develops incredibly well. I quite literally found myself incapable of looking away at the movie's midway point.  An original, captivating and just all around great film.",1510963200,,485,5.10126582278481

6336328,5,B00J5LXU02,"An excellent vampire movie for the modern era, a rare feat. A perfect blend of action, body horror, and a great interpretation of a classical monster. Despite being about such a surreal topic, it doesn't rely too heavily on special effects, all while being completely believable and immersive. The scenery is perfect, the cast (especially the lead), is perfect - I wouldn't change a thing.",1509408000,,389,5.0
6336329,4,B00J5LXU02,"I'm glad I gave this a chance.  I started off groaning at the prospect of another douchey found footage style movie, but soon found myself empathizing with the unfortunate yet badassed and admittedly kind of hot protagonist.
Yet another modern take on a classic theme, and a pretty effective one !",1509408000,,297,4.823529411764706

6336332,4,B00J5LXU02,"Ok ,so,.....I never review anything.
This flick deserves a review.
After reading the others, I decided to watch this . It really is a great movie. I also agree that these guys really . Are great actors!

6336345,4,B00J5LXU02,"Really nice movie! The transition from the beginning to what happens after is quite cool. Also it didn't feel low budget, which shows that these filmmakers really know what they're doing, and I can only imagine how well they'd do with an even bigger budget. Impressive.",1508544000,,269,4.869565217391305

6336349,3,B00J5LXU02,"This is a decent enough low-budget horror flix. The concept is slightly overused ('found fortage' and the 'bad' guy killing badder guys) but I enjoyed it. If you enjoy this type of movie I'd recommend ""Wer"" here on Prime also.",1508198400,,226,4.675

6336425,5,B00J5LXU02,I speak as a lifelong horror fan. Don't let the reviews spoil anything for you. Just make the leap and watch the movie. Starts off slow but in the end you'll realize it was better than you expected.,1505347200,,198,4.2368421052631575

6336429,5,B00J5LXU02,Acting? Bad. Real bad. General script? Just as bad. Storyline? Predictable and meh. Cinematography? Saved the day! I would almost tell you to watch this on mute...but don't.

6336463,5,B00J5LXU02,I never write reviews but was compelled to for this movie. I am a horror movie buff and this is one of the best ones I have ever seen. It was so creepy and made me jump but it was also emotional and I felt sympathy for the vampire which I had never experienced before in a vampire movie. I will recommend this to all of my horror movie friends. It was excluding and brilliantly done.,1504224000,,383,4.052631578947368

But I'm being harsh partially because of the high expectations the rest gave me. I highly recommend this movie! It's everything I want out of a 'transforming into a vampire' movie, with some truly terrifying moments, not just because of well done jump scares, but more so because you truly feel for what the characters are going through, and are terrified with them. Good use of makeup effects helps too. It's also got some great first person action scenes, from the perspective of a vampire no less, along with some mild but well used gore.

Not to mention after reading the description, it didn't really spark an interest in me. So I was not expecting anything other than for it to flop similar to 80% of horror movies that are out there. An the first 10 min of the movie definitely pushed me further or rather yet, closer to the back button. For some reason I continued to watch, even when I had to stop the movie, I came back just to ride out the rest of it. Needless to say, I was shocked. By movies end, I was enthralled, entertained, sad, happy. I wanted more. It's not perfect, but considering it was on a budget of less than 400K, it damn well deserves more than a standing ovation from the world of Indie Films. One of the most original representation of modern day vampires, if that's what you want to call it. I can't help but want more, a sequel to cliff and Derek's journey. I recommend this movie to film lovers. Someone who could enjoy a film, without trying to find fault in everything. It's either bad or good. I'm going with the latter.

It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but I definitely wouldn't consider this a waste of time for a movie.
To put it this way, I put this on because I was drawing and just wanted something playing in the background, but I didn't get any drawing done because this was fast passed and interesting enough that I couldn't look away!

6337031,5,B00J5LXU02,"This movie is excellent.  I like vampire movies.  I always have, but I've found that most movies emphasize their sexuality, their beauty, their mystery.  Few truly portray the horror involved in the realization that you now need to consume human blood.  This movie truly drew out the horror involved in the frightening realization that you're turning into a monster, and there's nothing you can do to stop it, especially when you have no idea what you're doing.

Again, just my personal experience, but I generally don't like found footage films.  This one changed my mind on them.  The actors did an excellent job, and considering that it was a low budget film, it was really well made.  It had little of the camp that a lot of low-budget horror films possess.  And there was some genuine wisdom in there.

There have been so many of these (no offense to any directors, but most of them in recent years have been terrible), so I almost skipped this one. But this flick actually has a believable storyline (something a little bit different from the typical, run-of-the-mill vamp theme), along with beautiful European scenery and very good special effects. The last half hour (or so) for me was when I decided that a 3-star rating should be bumped up to 4-star: it all sort of came together at that point. Overall it was good, because it was different and it didn't follow the 'same-old same-old' formula that so many movies of this genre (sadly) seem to be falling into these days. I admire writers, and actors (in this case the two lead actors also wrote the script, which was interesting) who work to push that 'let's think outside the box' concept in modern horror movies. This particular genre could certainly use some 'fresh blood', that is for sure! An interesting remake of a very old, very used horror theme.",1529193600,,1122,4.729591836734694
