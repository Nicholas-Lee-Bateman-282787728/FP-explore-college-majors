8693263,5,B00QXXLCRS,"Bought this for someone who is from St. Francis, but stuck in MN in a nursing home.  He really enjoys all the familiar scenery and the horses - a few familiar faces too.  We've spent many happy hours watching this.  Nice to have the language too.  He's a native Lakota speaker but chikila Lakota wowaglake...so he gets to hear the language other than my stumbling attempts.  Pilamaya ye Sinte Gleshka!  I would recommend this to everyone!",1524009600,,438,4.697368421052632
8693264,5,B00QXXLCRS,"Very important content regarding the practical and spiritual meaning significance of the horse to the Lakota people.  I am using it in a history course on Native Americans of the upper Midwest.  Heart breaking, as so many of the documentaries are that deal with the genocide of Native people in the Americas, but also inspirational and hopeful.  Highly recommend.",1522627200,,363,5.11864406779661
8693265,5,B00QXXLCRS,"A beautiful portrait of the powerful Lakota spirit that survives after all the misguided, heartbreaking efforts to destroy it. How the Lakota have preserved their resiliency is a lesson for all humanity. It's a life-giving lesson for me.",1508112000,,237,5.2631578947368425
8693266,5,B00QXXLCRS,"I saw this film at the Red Nation Film Festival in 2014 so when I saw it was available on DVD I had to have it. This was an excellent documentary, looking at the impact horses have on our tribal communities and how they can be used to heal. As a clinical psychologist who has used horses in a therapeutic environment, I would highly recommend this movie. The fact that royalties go towards a wonderful cause is all the more reason to support this film.",1489276800,3,452,4.329411764705882

8693270,5,B00QXXLCRS,"First of all, the proceeds from this DVD go to a great cause. Second, I thought that the documentary was well done. As a fan of all things equine, I appreciated learning about traditional horse knowledge. As a Native person, I was happy to see a positive story. So often, media representations of Native people is negative. This is a compilation of stories of hope and love. I was fortunate enough to share this film with my classroom of fifth graders. I highly recommend this film.",1431216000,6,482,4.616279069767442
