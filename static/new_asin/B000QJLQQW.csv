2839061,1,B000QJLQQW,"There's a big, giant ""Moser Baer"" watermark that obstructs the upper, left-hand corner of the screen, and it never goes away. At times people look like they have ""Moser Baer"" digitally tattooed across their foreheads. If at all possible, find some other distributor for this movie. Don't buy this one unless you want to suffer hours of frustration.",1309996800,6,348,5.017241379310345
2839062,4,B000QJLQQW,"I did not like it at all. Was very disappointed. Was really expecting more. Shahrukh and Preity  performances are the only thing that kept me watching this till the end.  Those two are fantastic! But...... try as I did, I just did not like the girl he fell in love with. Yes, I know, the horrible things that have happened to her......but she doesn't invoke sympathy in me. Her performance contradicts itself. This story had so much potential to be great, and it just was a let down. My expectations were very high for this movie and perhaps that's why I feel it was a total let down because after the first half, I just couldn't wait till it was over. I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. But, this is just a single opinion. So don't take my word for it, watch it and form your own. Also, the copy I got from Amazon (which was new) kept freezing (no its not my dvd player, I tried others it does the same thing). So quite disappointed.

I rated it 4 stars for 2 reasons: Shahrukh is in it and anything less than 5 stars for him just isn't good enough, and because there are 2 songs I really liked. I thought the dancing was fantastic and the music very original and matched the theme of the movie very well. But I am biased when it comes to Shahrukh. I'd rate all his films 5 stars even if they weren't that great just because his in it. His fantastic! A great soul. The world needs more men like him. I respect the guy a whole great deal.....but I just was so disapointed, even for Shahrukh, just couldn't give this movie higher than 4 stars.",1292457600,,1560,4.210702341137123
2839063,5,B000QJLQQW,"Wow, was this different. A friend of mine asked if I had seen Dil Se when I said I had loved Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, and when she found out I hadn't she gave it to me as a gift. I have to say i was expecting something much different then what I got, but I'm glad it was. This is a very serious film, if your looking for puppies and rainbows you won't get them here. What you do get is an amazingly beautiful, artistic, gritty, tense love story that leaves you thinking ""wow, would I go that far for love? Would i make those choices?"" and feeling like ""this could really have happened.""
The characters really make you feel for them, and the acting is the best I've seen to date. Shahrukh Khan (Amar) makes you feel his desperate and terrifyingly all consuming love for Manisha Koirala (Meghna), while she brings to life a very contradicting character who is all a once tough as nails, hopelessly in love, and dangerous to boot.
The musical numbers are breathtaking and have little to do with the plot. What they do convey completely is what is going on internally for the characters. The choreography will blow you away (especially the song Chaiyya Chaiyya), and the music is addicting.
All in all Dil Se gives you a story you will watch in tense anticipation to its explosive conclusion. A must see, and a film that will stay with you long after.",1281484800,,1351,4.429718875502008
2839064,4,B000QJLQQW,"The story was good, very different from most Bollywood movies. but I have to say that I really loved the music and dance numbers the most.",1273968000,,138,4.346153846153846
2839065,5,B000QJLQQW,"This is a must see for anyone interested in Bollywood films.  The first dance number is particularly memorable.  The dancers are filmed atop trains in the rugged Indian countryside, twisting through ravines and tunnels.  The song was remixed featuring Panjabi MC for the closing credits of Inside Man, a Spike Lee film that came out in 2006.

The film is well-written and well acted, emotionally insightful, and politically complex.  While it has humorous moments, it is essentially a love story in the tradition of Romeo and Juliet.  The hero is a journalist, the heroine a member of a terrorist insurgency.  Rather than being frothy and glamorous, the musical numbers serve to illuminate the emotional realities of characters who are struggling to overcome political, religious, class, and ethnic differences.",1252800000,,811,5.2890625
2839066,5,B000QJLQQW,"'Dil Se' is certainly not your typical Bollywood film.  You know, guy falls in love with girl, parents object but they end up together anyway.  'Dil Se' is nothing like this - which is probably why it did not do too well at the Indian box office.
This movie is a romantic film, but the political/social undertones are strong.  In the first half a journalist (played by the legend Shah Rukh Khan in what I consider his best-acted role) falls hopelessly in love with a mysterious woman (Manisha Koirala, truly one of India's best actresses).  Sounds typical, right?  Wrong!  No matter how many times I watch this movie I am always in awe of the way this 'romance' is handled.  The journalist's relentless pursuit of this woman who REALLY doesn't seem to have time for him is both disturbing and intriguing.  And this is only the first half.  I can't tell you about the second half.
The cinematography of this film is like none other I have ever seen - it is raw and sinister, not saturated and bright like that of other Hindi films.  The mood is also very different.  From the very first scene you are drawn in.  I've shown 'Dil Se' to many of my friends who have never seen an Indian movie before, and they have all been left in awe.
There are some really beautiful scenes in this movie.  And it succeeds in the technical department as well. Often when Bollywood films try to tackle subjects such as terrorism and weapons (don't worry, I haven't ruined anything for you) they end up looking really silly because the directors don't seem to know much about these subjects.  But 'Dil Se' accomplishes this with striking realism.
One last thing: the music! This film may not have done well, but the soundtrack became an instant classic and is still beloved in India (and beyond) today.  It is simply superb.  You may recognize the opening number ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"", danced by Khan without harness on a moving train.  It is a very well-known sequence.
Basically if you consider yourself a serious film lover and are looking for something unconventional and beautiful, 'Dil Se' is a must watch.  If you are looking for scantily-clad backup dancers, vacuous plots and sickeningly sweet endings - I don't recommend this film!",1219104000,2,2216,4.682170542635659
2839067,5,B000QJLQQW,"If you are a fan of Shahrukh Khan, of course you must have Dil Se.  It is one of his more modern movies, so it is not so much about silliness as usual.  For American audiences it brings more understanding of culture in India, as all Bollywood movies do, especially the tension between tradition and modern culture. Also, it tackles the question of Kashmir and terrorism in general.  The ending took my breath away - and not just because Shahrukh is so darling - but because the political message, while far from on the surface, is eternally and irrevocably true.  This video is powerful because it invades that land of romance and ""happy ever after"" that we sometimes experience with Bollywood, and literally blows it away.",1197763200,,723,4.714285714285714

8196602,3,B000QJLQQW,"The theme of love is strong, but I don't want to watch it again. After the movie was over I looked up a review someone had given on the plot and that review made me think about the conclusion of this film, and that part I was able to appreciate, that it made me think.

8196603,5,B000QJLQQW,I love this film - but in a painful way. This film leaves me speachless. It is incredibly impactful. The love story is one of the most powerful I've seen.,1335312000,,154,4.166666666666667
8196604,5,B000QJLQQW,"I love this movie! I know others have issues with accuracy, believability, etc. but it's still a Bollywood movie--not a documentary. I love the young, naive character Shah Rukh plays in it, and his persistence, although, my husband says he should've just pursued the belly dancer (Malaika Arora Khan) that was dancing on top of the train with him at the beginning of the movie and saved himself alot of trouble! (A really great scene, by the way!)

I already owned the Moserbaer version of this movie before I bought this one, and it's a pretty bad version of the movie. It just seems really cheap, cuts off in places and has their watermark glaringly obvious in the corner the whole time, and also doesn't look very clear. (I've experienced the same thing with other Moserbaer movies so I just won't buy those anymore.) I decided to try Eros' version and what a huge difference! I love it. This version is definitely the one to buy.",1334966400,2,933,4.620481927710843
8196605,5,B000QJLQQW,"As a big Bollywood fan, and an even bigger Shahrukh Khan fan, I expected to like this movie. What I didn't expect was the level of emotions this movie provoked. I won't go into any spoilers, but I did not expect the movie to end the way it did. That is very unusual for a Bollywood movie.

My very favorite Bollywood song, Chaiyya Chaiyya, is from this movie, and this song and dance sequence is nothing short of brilliant. Dancing on top of the train! I love the music and dance scenes from Bollywood anyway, but this dance was beautifully choreographed, and the dancing on top of the train was amazing. The scenic route taken by the train is simply beautiful.

This is one of my favorite Shahrukh Khan movies, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen it. It never gets old.",1329782400,5,780,4.372413793103449
8196606,1,B000QJLQQW,"Spoiler Alert.  Don't get me wrong. I love Bollywood movies. I'm a huge fan of shahrukh khan. But this movie sucked. He meets a girl at a train station, decides he's in love with her, chases her all over India and in the end, she's a suicide bomber and she's strapped in the bomb ready to go kill some people, and they guy is begging her to just tell him that she loves him, and she just looks at him and he hugs her and they blow up. The End.

This movie was about 3 hours long. That's 3 hours of my life I'll never get back.",1323993600,4,526,3.9065420560747666
8196607,2,B000QJLQQW,"(Note: This review does contain a spoiler.)

My husband and I have been watching Bollywood movies for several years now, and we like Shahrukh Khan, which is why I picked up this DVD from our library.  I knew from glancing at some of the reviews here on Amazon that this film wasn't going to be like the ""fun"" Bollywood movies we'd seen, but I was not prepared for how different it would be.  We don't mind films that are artsy or unconventional, so those aspects of ""Dil Se"" weren't a problem for us (though we did have quite a few ""What the heck?"" moments when we couldn't tell where this story was trying to go!).

The main problem we had with this movie was the level of violence, specifically the flashback scene where a 12 year old girl sees her sister getting raped, only to be chased down and raped herself. Though the scene was not graphic from a visual standpoint, it was extremely disturbing and seemed to go on forever.  The emotional impact of this scene was bad enough to outweigh any of the good aspects of the film.  By the time it was over, we wished we hadn't watched this movie.

This ""Why, oh why did I watch that?"" feeling is a major reason why we don't watch many Hollywood movies anymore.  We've enjoyed Bollywood movies because the ones we've seen have not left us disturbed at the end ... that is, until this one.

I understand that the rape is a pivotal event in this story, and I know many will argue that we need to see this scene in order to understand the choices a main character has made.  I'm not interested in making any analysis of the artistic merits of this film, or protesting filmed depictions of violence against women, or complaining about violent films, etc.  I believe people are generally capable of making these sorts of judgements for themselves.

My point in writing this is to inform other sensitive viewers that this film may present problems for them.  If I had seen a review like this one, I would have skipped this film.",1313452800,5,1971,4.456824512534819
8196608,2,B000QJLQQW,I guess I'm into more of the happier Sharukah Khan movies.  Both of the actors played their roles very well.  Sharukah Khan is my favorite Bollywood actor. But the movie was just too sad. So if you want a tear jerker - here it is.,1310860800,2,230,4.088888888888889
