8505435,3,B006W95BZC,"Released in 1968, Day of the Evil Gun stars Glenn Ford and Arthur Kennedy as two older men pursuing the Apaches who kidnapped the wife and daughters of the former. The two are at odds because the latter wants to be the man of the family after the former skipped out and was thought dead. Unfortunately, the trail is two months cold and they run into numerous problems, like being staked out in the desert and being hindered by a curious group of remote soldiers.

Day of the Evil Gun has a quality late 60s Western vibe, so if you favor Westerns from this period, like 1966 Duel at Diablo and 1970s Two Mules for Sister Sara, its worthwhile, but its mortally hampered by several unbelievable scenes, particularly the yeah right climatic rescue sequence. Another problem is the way a certain character curiously morphs into a brutal, conniving and cowardly murderer at the end, which he was not previously during all the various stressful trials. Its unfortunate because with just a little tweaking this wouldve been an effective Western.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Durango, Mexico.
