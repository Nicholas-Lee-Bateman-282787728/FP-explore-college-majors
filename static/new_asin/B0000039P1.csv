8213212,5,B0000039P1,"This was in my opinion one of the best years ever for Saturday Night Live. The greatest comedy geniuses the world has ever seen all in one cast on one show. You can't beat that. Chevy Chase shows up for his final season as a cast member, John Belushi is excellent in Samuri Delicatessen, and he premiers the Blues Brothers in his killer bee costume while singin ""King Bee"". Gilda does her Barbra Walters impression, and my favorite is Dan Aikroid's Nixon sketch. If you enjoy classic timeles sketch comedy than you'll love this tape. I would recomend taking halucinagyns at the same time if you get a chance because this thing is a phsycadelic trip. Definetly a must for any fan of the show.",1084579200,,691,4.536
