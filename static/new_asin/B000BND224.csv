I even had a spare HDMI cable so I was able to hook my laptop or PC to our TV so I was able to watch it there. It is also possible to override your DVD' settings by pressing a code on your remote but you'd have to check that on the internet. Anyway, this was a bargain buy for me and I pretty much watched most of the movies on this collection with no issues. It's not heavy on special features but I bought this quite cheap so I can't complain (I got this for only 18 bucks!!!) I would take out a star from this though because it seems to be already outclassed by the other collections that are recently being put out, unless you were lucky like me who got this for such a low price.",1454457600,,797,3.9875
8089306,3,B000BND224,"I purchased this set because I am a fan of the movies despite knowing that Universal UK screwed the box set up pretty bad.  Four films, The Birds, Marnie, Torn Curtain and Topaz are in the wrong aspect ratio, that explains the price.  That means ten films are formatted properly at the correct aspect ratio which makes the purchase at a budget price worthwhile for me.  The US set is better and doesn't have as many problems, you can read about it at Amazon.com as well and is recommended above this set except for price.  I don't have it for comparison purposes but reading the product reviews makes that fact obvious.  Look for a customer return of this set for the best deal as some buyers are caught unaware and very disappointed that it has such serious problems.  I won't bother with individual reviews of the 14 films, anyone interested will know something about most or all of the films.  The video quality is OK, again the US set has some better transfers but outside of the four hatchet jobs this one is pretty good.

This set requires a Region 2 PAL capable player but I read that all but one disc is formatted for Region 4 also, which is weird if true.",1304467200,8,1164,4.431924882629108
8089307,5,B000BND224,"It is a very good box set that is interested in the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock. It has the classics Psycho, Vertigo, The Birds, and Rear Window. But it also has many of his lesser known films. For example it has the film Rope which is a good film and it was just an experiment. Trust me you won't regret buying this it is a very good box set.",1274745600,,351,4.0285714285714285
