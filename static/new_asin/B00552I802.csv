4571142,5,B00552I802,"The most great excercise in my life. I really loved it!!!
I feel how it burning and form my muscles. Really good.",1373414400,,113,4.181818181818182
4571143,5,B00552I802,I went to a live class as Piloxing sounded like something new and fun.  When I got back I purchased Viveca's DVDs and have never been happier.  Looking for a good workout - this is the one you want,1365897600,3,197,4.0256410256410255
4571144,4,B00552I802,I love this workout.  Hits all three major body areas in a short period of time and Viveca makes it a lot of fun to do.,1365120000,,119,3.576923076923077
4571145,5,B00552I802,"I love the piloxing dvd and this one is wonderful too, allows me to fit in a small focused workout when I don't have time for the full version. Both are great for toning those trouble spots and both leave you feeling great and sexy!",1364428800,2,232,4.177777777777778
4571146,5,B00552I802,I have several exercise DVDs and this one is definately one of the best.  I love it!!  It is totally unigue.  Who would think boxing and pilates could mesh so well together.  It makes me feel tough and sexy all at the same time.,1352073600,,228,4.113636363636363
4571147,5,B00552I802,"This DVD is a great intro or supplement to the piloxing workout classes and has been great when I have been on the road.

You have the option to either do the entire workout or focus on specific areas with this DVD. It is very flexible to develop a program with and super easy to follow on your own.

Highly recommended!",1341532800,3,320,4.229508196721311
4571148,5,B00552I802,"I have a new found love of the Piloxing method!!! I am also taking Piloxing classes. Undoubtedly the BEST workout that I've ever done. You feel EVERY SINGLE MUSCLE working!!! I absolutely LOVE this DVD - my body was sore for 2 full days after (and I loved it!). I was screaming: THIS IS TORTURE!!! during the legs/butt workout, but my goodness, it WORKS!!! I also have the Piloxing gloves, which bring a new type of intensity to the arms portion of the workout. I love that, throughout the entire 60 minute DVD, I feel my abs working. TRY THIS DVD!",1331164800,9,548,4.435643564356436
4571149,4,B00552I802,"The making of this program is really quite horrible. There's no DVD menu (you have to ""skip scenes"" to choose a specific 20 minute workout) and the editing is choppy at best. However, the actual material itself is great--you really can feel the burn, and it's actually quite fun! Overall, not as great as the first Piloxing DVD, but definitely worth buying if you're into Vivica Jensen's routines!",1313884800,16,397,4.852941176470588
4571150,5,B00552I802,"This DVD is as great as the Piloxing one, but much more intense.
If you are looking for a workout that really tones you, this is the one.
I love it, it's such a challenge.",1313193600,12,171,3.914285714285714
8457290,5,B00552I802,Love it!,1505088000,,8,3.5
8457291,5,B00552I802,good work for me as a beginner,1433548800,,30,3.4285714285714284
8457292,3,B00552I802,"average, would not purchase again",1431561600,,33,5.8
8457293,5,B00552I802,I love this video.  I just had a baby so time is limited for me to workout and this is perfect.  No special equipment needed to do these workouts.  Highly recommend for people with little time and don't want to buy equipment,1420502400,,224,4.285714285714286
8457294,5,B00552I802,Ignoring the fact that Jensen is overly enthusiastic the exercises work,1411862400,,71,5.545454545454546
8457295,4,B00552I802,Good workout!  Video quality is not the best but still a good workout! Great if you are limited on time.,1386806400,,104,4.2
8457296,5,B00552I802,This workout is intense. It makes me feel great after just 20 mins. I feel the burn throughout the workout. This is well worth the money. I like her energy as well. Great workout!!,1383523200,,180,4.323529411764706
8457297,2,B00552I802,"Nothing wrong with seller, but the tape itself is nothing new. I have a tape from years ago with the same moves but a different instructor. I'm disappointed that I pic this tape to try from this series.",1381881600,3,202,4.342105263157895
8457298,1,B00552I802,"Really basic and non-stimulating. Did not see the main piloxing DVD , but this one is for someone who hardly exercises. Yes, repetitive motions are difficult to maintain, but I don't see much toning coming out of this. Boring, underwhelming and does not really tell you what piloxing is all about. Waste of money in my opinion.",1378512000,3,327,4.754385964912281
8457299,3,B00552I802,"Not too shabby; good to mix up work outs and do something different. I did not find that the instructor focused much on form which seems counter intuitive for a Pilates work out, especially in the floor portion of the work out.",1375056000,,227,4.428571428571429
