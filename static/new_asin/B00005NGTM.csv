7947141,4,B00005NGTM,I love this series. It's very expressive of the japanese culture. I do perceive it has a racist tone to it against other nationalities. Other than that. Its a great cartoon.,1447459200,,173,4.612903225806452
7947142,4,B00005NGTM,"Seems okay. If addicted already to this animation series. Seems to me the same plots get played over and over. Struggling for a living, going to school, upset with the alien, alien upsetting other alien. Just wish the  foreign language sponsor guy had English words going across screen to see what he is saying.",1045440000,,311,4.7592592592592595
7947143,5,B00005NGTM,"The comedy and the sight gags are great for lifting the overwhelming atmosphere of angst and hopelessness in this disc, but the diamond of the story is the absolutely authentic portrayal of the heroine of the story, Mayuko.  The first time I viewed the episode about her agonizing over going out with some friends, but being ashamed of her poverty, I was astounded. It absolutely could have been lifted from the life of any young person struggling with making it on their own today.
In a way, it reminds me of the struggles that Kiki goes through in the acclaimed movie Kiki's Delivery Service, but that is where the comparison ends. The animation and the pace is similar to Lain, but that is where the comparison ends. The mood swings of the main character are similar to Eva, but that is where the comparison ends.
This series is like nothing I have seen yet, and I love it. At a time where I had seen most of the off beat anime out there and was hungary for another Cowboy Bebop or Blue Sub No. 6 to just fill my eyes with candy and fill my mind with problems to be considered, this series literally lept off the shelf into my hands.
Be aware, that there are no villains in this series, just a lot of people suffering through the morass that is their life. It is not unlike being stuck in a small town in rural USA. The gold here is in the story.",1008201600,3,1349,4.311023622047244
7947144,4,B00005NGTM,"Niea_7 is not what people expect from anime (Japanese animation). There is no deadly violence, super-cute attack creatures, giant robots, or nudity. Even the bathhouse scenes are tame enough to show young children with no regret. The only worrisome parts are the jokes done with Chada (big-head, wears turban) that are a bit over the edge at times.
It presents itself without background and does not answer anything simply. This is the way things are and we'll merrily hop along with the story; there is no pretentiousness. It is a slow story that is still not fully manifested at the end of the second volume, but a clear hint is laid down that one character may be more than she appears. Will this be played up in the expected manner of a prodigy or gifted-one or will they dash it flat with a massive change of direction and unprecedented revelation that fits in a plausible but slightly weird way (I hope)?
The whole kick to it is while the story is forming there are the half-hour episodes themselves that feature intentionally (...) humor (not sure to laugh or groan) some of finer stuff is probably lost on American audiences in translation. How do you translate a cultural language joke over such a gap; use footnotes I guess?
If you throw away any preconceived ideas and watch the show with an open mind you may find it enjoyable. It is all very real in it's work up and has a ""theatrical play"" like feel to it with moderately exaggerated characters and believable settings.
I recommend it for something different when you get all burnt out on American animation, bloody serious movies and butchered ""toonami"" refuse.
I'll give this one more star depending on how the story ends.",1007251200,,1688,4.706081081081081
7947145,5,B00005NGTM,"I've already seen the fisrt volume of Niea Under 7 and enjoyed it. The second volume is alot better in my opinion, and has a quicker pace. Not to metion it's 10 times funnier.
The three episodes on this volume really help develope the character's personalities. We learn more about the core characters, and watch as they plot to expand their bathouse's business.
Episode one shows how the bathhouse's plan to get more customers backfires and only brings in a bunch of video game playing kids.
Episode 2 is probabally the funniest. Niea's and Mayuko's hasty retreat from the rival bathhouse had me laughing for at least a minute. You just have to watch it to see what I'm talking
about.
Episode three slants back to a more serious atmosphere.  Mayuko is invited to a group date, and has mixed feelings about going.  Meanwhile Niea thinks shes being contacted by her mothership.
The English version is surprisingly good on this vloume too!
If you like anime with a lighter side, try out this volume of Niea Under 7. It'll give you a good laugh, and take your mind of the troubled world.",1003968000,,1084,4.640625
7947146,5,B00005NGTM,"I saw the first DVD of NieA a month ago I feel right in the story and I couldn't stop watching it and when I saw the second DVD come out I bought it right away. This series is so different and funny. The characters have great personality and look cool as well. This anime is more like a comedy but I am having the feeling that its going to turn in the serious mode in the next DVD. I maybe be wrong but when I saw the last episode of the second DVD it made me think a lot as to whats next in the series. Thinking so much about it has made me want to get the next DVD right away but its not out yet. The three episodes are great and funny and picture is very clear. Menus are nice and music is catchy in my opinion. If you saw Lain and are interested from something that looks like Lain then buy this. I really recomend this to all anime fans though. This anime is so funny and just plain great that I keep watching it over and over and I hope you too to get your moneys worth of course. Anyway watch it, steal it, or rent this because this is a series not to be missed like Lain is.",1003881600,,1082,3.8348214285714284
