1178627,4,B000003KDD,"Axel Foley is back in the sequel to Beverly Hills cop.  As a fan of the original, Beverly Hills Cop II is a worthy sequel.  Axel comes back to Beverly Hills to investigate the shooting of a friend tied to a string of burglaries.  Axel as a character hasn't changed a bit and still a smart mouthed wise cracking Detective, and a good one at that.  The story has a very 80's action movie feel to it with lots of humor added.  If that's what you're looking for, then look no further.",1484697600,,480,4.173913043478261

1178680,3,B000003KDD,The sequel to Beverly Hills Cop is good on it's own.  Although to me.  At the beginning of the film.  The Ronnie Cox character and the Eddie Murphy Charecter are now fishing buddies.  Which maybe they like and understand each other better now.  To me they just don't seem like they would be hanging out.  The other charecters  are pretty much the same.  They all get along with Axel now.  As he comes back to Beverly Hills after Ronnie Cox gets ambushed.  And get's involved in a conspiracy.  There is a new Chief in this.  Allen Garfield si himself particuarily foul mouthed and obnoxios.  And Brigitte Nielsen is a pretty good villain.  This isn't as good as the original.  But it's good.,1478736000,,690,4.540983606557377
1178681,5,B000003KDD,I love this movie. DVD in perfect condition.,1472774400,,44,4.625
1178682,2,B000003KDD,"Eddie Murphy returns to the role of Axel Foley in the follow-up to the 1984 blockbuster Beverly Hills Cop. The triumvirate of director Tony Scott along with producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer--and don't forget Paramount--responsible for last year's megahit Top Gun bring us Beverly Hills Cop II. A film that is more of a loud, noisy, crude, frenzied, monstrous rock video which might be mistaken for a Sylvester Stallone actioner. Foley returns to the city of swimming pools and movie stars in the wake of a brazen crime spree. The culprits nearly kill a cop (Ronny Cox). Upon the Detroit lawman's arrival, he finds his California comrades (John Ashton and Judge Reinhold) have been removed from pursuing an investigation of the crime wave by the chief (Allen Garfield) who have reassigned the pair to ticketing moving violators.
  Foley cajoles, coerces, and convinces his cop chums once again--old habits never die, they just continue in sequels--to help him pursue an investigation-, albeit an independent and unauthorized one. Their search leads them to a shooting club owned by a slick, shady European tycoon (Jurgen Prochnow), a racing track owned by same, and the Playboy Mansion; thus allowing for a cameo by Hugh Hefner and gal pal Carrie Leigh.
  Murphy's nemesis again is an uber wealthy Euro trash businessman whose diction is flawless and his demeanor implacable. Prochnow (or maybe his agent) is no doubt hoping for an opportunity to make him more accessible to mainstream audiences. Something which obviously didn't happen with his being among the cast of David Lynch's adaptation of Dune just over two years ago. Here Prochnow is doing nothing more than chew the scenes as a watered-down Bond villain. It's a wonder he hasn't been cast as a 007 nemesis.
  Beverly Hills Cop II has a few in-jokes which allude to the fact that the first film was once devised as a Stallone vehicle, chief among them: Reinhold's digs has posters for Rambo: First Blood Part II and Cobra on the walls; and Prochnow's moll is portrayed by Stallone's wife, Brigitte Nielsen.
  Tony Scott brings nothing notable to this overlong rock video. Murphy's performance here seems to make his work in the first film almost worthy of an Oscar nomination. This time Murphy does little more than a rehash of his performance in the first film. He seems to zoom through his scenes like the Ferrari he tools around in during his brief time in the Motor City--which he hands over to a fellow lawman (Paul Reiser in a sizable cameo)--without allowing us much of a chance to hear the jokes clearly. Maybe Murphy didn't find the screenplay, based on a story which he is credited with having had a hand in crafting, was of high quality. Perhaps Paramount and he are hoping for repeat business which will enable moviegoers to hear lines they missed hearing in their first viewing.",1472774400,,2862,4.910973084886129

I love the first Beverly Hills Cop and Im one of the few that loves part 2 even more. This blu ray has stellar video and audio. Its very disappointing and disrespectful to the late Tony Scott that Paramount skimped on porting over the extras from the dvd to the blu ray though. Why this doesn`t have a U.S. release is beyond me since the first one was released but I am just thrilled to finally have a quality blu ray of Beverly Hills Cop 2!

Anyway,  Mr.  Murphy made the absurdity work for him although a little subtleness would have given the impression that the people he was trying to fool at least had some intelligence, thus making for more believability, suspense and humor.  Bad language is rarely funny so I did not laugh at it when spoken.  Brigitte Nielsen was not put to good use in BHC2.  She is so striking in appearance and should have been the main antagonist.  BHC2 is an amusing movie that could have been much better.",1425945600,,661,4.368852459016393

1179958,3,B000003KDD,"Beverly Hills Chief gets gunned down. Axel Foley finds out on the news. Goes back to Beverly Hills to help his ""friend"" by catching the criminals.

After the success of the first one this sequel came back with a free license to come out of the closet on the political agenda behind it--promote black culture at the expense of white culture. The white cops began cursing and disrespecting the law so they were ""cool"" now. The black cop even calls that out with the added bonus comment of ""before long you will have a big dick like us too"" (or something like that). Why not just a cop movie about cops that are helping each other out? Why the insecurity of ""I'm black and you are white"" nonsense? Isn't that what we are all supposed to strive for--colorblindness? How can anyone when you are constantly reminded of it? The naked women (just to be naked) are swinging off of vines . . . uh poles. Profanity EVERYWHERE by all characters not just the black cops. Every other word was f this or f that. All this stuff clouded a decent cop movie plot. However the CA is a freaky place really had been played out in the first movie in this series as well as others. And America was entering its recession that would change the dynamics of country to this day. So the we are richer than God stuff really fell flat.

1180062,3,B000003KDD,"If you're into Eddie Murphy or the Beverly Hill Cop movies, then give this one a watch.  If you don't like Eddie Murphy and are disgusted by his transsexual prostitute encounter and his era of kids movies, then maybe don't watch it.  For those who are in, when you get past the fact that its a sequel and not as fresh, you'll find a movie that will help you pass the time.  I've seen this movie many a time on a Sunday morning, waiting for football to start, for example.

The movie reprises Eddie Murphy's role as Axle Foley.  Along with him are Rosewood and Taggert from the first movies(also, like I wouldn't care as much if these characters weren't in here).  The bad guy from Robocop(Bogomil) who was in the first movie is also in this one.  When I think about it, I can remember exactly what the plot was and I'm not going to read a synopsis to refresh my memory, I'm just going to describe what I think I remember.

Axel Foley comes out to Los Angeles again, after Bogomil is gunned down and hospitalized.  Once in LA, he becomes aware of the alphabet criminal, who leaves crossword puzzle type clues behind for the detectives, which I think once solved will reveal the bad guys plans.  I'm not sure how this makes sense in the movie, its like the writers were watching old batman episodes and thought of the riddler, but hey, that's just my theory.

Foley and his sidekicks then spend the movie trying to uncover the clues and find the criminals, while in between there's scenes of a bank robbery, chase and another robbery.  The story is basic, and the action scenes are mostly style.  This movie looks and feels different than the first.  The first is totally a comedy, where this one is a mash of comedy and action.  Its just odd to see how much different police station looks in the first one and the second, its like they turned out the lights inside the office in this movie.

The movie is directed by Tony Scott which explains why it has the style that it does.  Its a little surprising though to see him do a movie like this which is supposed to be more comedy driven, but I guess it didn't matter because the movie went on to gross over a 100$ million(which in 1980s dollars is 4 billion, compared to today's money).

Again though, if you can get past the absurdity of the plot and some of the scenes(and shut your mind off) you'll find an enjoyable movie.",1399766400,,2373,4.391304347826087

There was not tracking info for this item and being worried because of it being so close to Christmas that I wouldn't get it on time kinda sucked but I got it before Christmas and so everything was fine.

I won't spoil the rest; however, I was impressed by whomever decided to cast Nielsen and Prochnow as the baddies because they were very believable.  I was slightly disappointed with some of the shtick from Murphy as at times the movie was slightly over-improvised, but I enjoyed the scenes in the Strip Club and the Playboy Mansion.

After a few extremely funny films, Eddie took a shot at the action genre and while the Beverly Hills Cop series does succeed on some levels, it falls short because Eddie just isn't that good of a serious actor. This film may seems familiar, almost 48 hours-ish, but with nowhere near the wit. It's a solid action film with some funny moments, but if you're expecting LOL funny Murphy, then this is going to disappoint you. Eddie looks like a kid playing cops and robbers in these films and while they are not meant to be taken completely seriously, they are played serious enough that we must believe Murphy is this character, which we do not!""

Axel heads out to Beverly Hills to visit Bogomil in the hospital, and this is where Axel is reunited with Bogomil's daughter Jan Bogomil. Axel is also reunited with Detective Billy Rosewood and Sergeant John Taggart. Billy and Taggart decide to let Axel help them find the woman who tried to kill Bogomil, even though abusive police chief Harold Lutz has been deliberately trying to find a reason to fire Billy and Taggart. Axel, Billy, and Taggart soon discover that the alphabet robberies, a series of robberies that have been going on in the area, are masterminded by weapons kingpin Maxwell Dent, and Dent had sent his fiancee Karla Fry to try to kill Bogomil because Bogomil had been after Dent. With this information, Axel, Billy, and Taggart try to find Dent and Karla. ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" is the entertaining sequel to the 1984 smash hit.

This IS a good movie, and it is funny, but there's no way you can comapre it to the original. Its almost when you first ride a roller coaster, and you think, ""I've gotta ride that again!"". When you get off the second time, you're satisified, but it's just not the same. Again, BHCII, is a good movie, but is overshadowed by its predecessor.",1263427200,,623,4.621621621621622
1180204,5,B000003KDD,"The heat's back on! And Eddie Murphy is cool as ever in this sizzling, smash-hit sequel to BEVERLY HILLS COP. Det. Axel Foley (Murphy) is back-back where he doesn't belong! He's going ""deep, deep, deep undercover"" into the chic wilds of Southern California, unleashing his arsenal of blazing gunfire and rapid-fire gags against a gang of international munitions smugglers. Back, too, are Judge Reinhold(Det. Billy Rosewood) and John Ashton(Sgt. Taggart) as Murphy's crime-busting sidekicks and TOP GUNS's director Tony Scott keeps the pace fast, furious and funny.

Additionally, in this sequel, Alex teams up with Rosewood & Taggart to stop a gang of racketeers after Beverly Hills police Capt. Andrew Bogomil(Ronnie Cox)is gunned down & seriously wounded by the sleazy Karla Fry(Brigiette Nielsen)on Bogomil's way home one day after the thugs discover that his investigation to their big bank heist was on the correct track in the case, but the arrogant, salty, incompetent & verbally abusive new Beverly Hills police Chief Harold Lutz(Allen Garfield)who does everything he can to stay on Beverly Hills City Mayor Ted Egan's(Robert Ridgely)good side, complicates matters, but gets replaced by Bogomil as the new Chief of police since Mayor Egan ends up firing Lutz when he gets fed up with his rude, snotty, abusive attitude towards his own fellow officers at the Beverly Hills Police Dept.

Fortunately, Axel doesn't have to go beating around the bush as much in this sequel as he had to do in this movies predecessor since Taggart, Rosewood, and Bogolin already knew him in this movie as opposed to BEVERLY HILLS COP I, despite the fact that BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 didn't make as much money as the original did and recieved mixed reviews from critics, but BEVERLY HILLS COP II was still a box office success amassing $153,665,036 when it was released in theaters on Memorial Day Weekend of 1987, plus this film was nominated for an Oscar and for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song which was ""Shakedown"" by Bob Seger, plus this movie was definetly an upgrade from the original too since Axel has a Ferrari in this sequel instead of the Mercedes Benz he had in the first one.

Something intriguing that I noticed about this movie was the music composing that they used for the big heist scene when Bridgiette Nielsen & her fellow thugs start shooting & robbing a gallery at the beggining of this flick was quite similar to the music composing that John Carpenter used for the scene when Snake Plisskin(Kurt Russell)is staking out the Duke(Isaac Hayes)in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK.

This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to my teen years when I was still living in the Imperial Valley since I was 14 years old in the 8th grade at Wilson Jr. High School in my hometown(El Centro, CA)when this movie was made in the Spring of 1987 just before I graduated from Junior High.

1180207,4,B000003KDD,"The original Beverley Hills Cop is one of those films that remains a cult classic because of the fact that it's such a product of the time it was made. This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel, made three years later, and although part two; like many sequels, never quite manages that same verve as the original film - it still offers a good time, and anyone that enjoyed the first installment (and who didn't?) will probably have a good time with this sequel too. All the main players from the original film have been rounded up once again, with Eddie Murphy heading a capable ensemble cast, lots of wisecracks and some gratuitously over the top action sequences. The plot is, as you would expect, superfluous to the style of the film; and much of the movie is simply tailored around it; but anyway, it follows maverick copper Axel Foley and his two California police cronies as they are pulled into a case known as the 'alphabet murders', which involves a robbery, a tall blonde woman and a gun shop owner.

I've got to say that Eddie Murphy's wisecracks were a lot funnier in the first film. While they were still over the top, they were at least sort of believable. Here, however, Murphy goes massively over the top, and it's hard to imagine how anyone that obnoxious doesn't end up with a cracked jaw. Anyway, Murphy obviously enjoys himself; and if you can get by the complete lack of logic, you probably will too. True to style, the action is completely over the top too; with several ridiculous sequences combining to make the movie the entertaining blockbuster that it is. The film lacks any kind of themes or substance, meaning that it will both not please serious film fans, and that this reviewer is running out of steam; but I will say that this movie does have a point to make, and that is simply entertaining it's audience. It may be completely silly, illogical fun; but some movies need to be there just to entertain, and this is one of those. I wouldn't recommend sticking this movie at the top of any must see lists, or going into with huge expectations; but it's a good time, that's for sure.",1223596800,11,2135,4.5744125326370755

The major mistake of the movie comes from the storyline, which contains more bullets and not enough hilarity.

1180225,3,B000003KDD,"I'm pretty sure I watched the first one. Pretty sure. But this one is certainly a lot better than the first. This is what put me off watching the second one. I generally can't stand Eddie Murphy, I can just barely stand him in the Shrek movies. He's way too over the top for me. At the start of this film, he was overdoing his lines way too much, and I was regretting choosing this film. But it got surprisingly better, and bearable, to ignore Eddie Murphy.

I also annoyed my boyfriend greatly, as the theme tune to this, has become more well-known for being the theme to the Crazy Frog ringtone for mobiles. (Do you Americans have that over there yet? Avoid it all costs. I only have the 2 ringtones because I've been sent them by someone else.) So at the end of every little bit they played of the theme, I just HAD to say ""ding ding"". I had to start saying it to myself though. (And guess who only got the significance of the group's name, Axel F, halfway through the film?! I kept my mouth shut as my boyfriend would have been rolling about the floor with laughter. Hello, Eddie's character name is Axel Foley, how did I not put 2 & 2 together?! Duh.)

Hasn't Bridgette Nielsen aged? Especially from then to now. I recognised her in this film, since you can't exactly miss her, but when you see her now, it sends shivers up your spine. She's changed so much, and not for the better. How does she look at herself in the mirror? And as for the one, very gratuitous shot of her in the shooting range, boy does she have a set of legs on her! She seems a bit underused in this though.

There's cameos to be spotted in this film, including a very young Chris Rock (Murphy's predecessor?) and an almost dark haired Hugh Hefner.

This is definitely a better and more memorable film than the first one, although Eddie has definitely lost whatever made him good in the first place.",1126224000,2,1876,4.3210227272727275

1180227,5,B000003KDD,"Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is back in the  hit sequel, Beverly Hills Cop 2. Many times sequels  to original blockbuster films are sucky.  There even more sucky when the sequel is done by a different director (Tony Scott)  than the original film (Martin Brest) ,  but in this case that's not the case. Beverly Hills Cop 2 is amazingly good, it's funny, has a good script,

has action and suspense.

THe story in this film is that Axel's buddy, and friend former Chief Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) has been shot  and left for dead by a crazy lunatic arms dealer named  Karly Fry (brilliant done by Brigitte Nielsen).

Axel , back in Detroit, heads to Beverly Hills to see  his friend and to aid his fellow friends Billy Rosewood  (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton)  in getting justice for his friend.

However, a new police chief Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield)  a small man with lots of power, plans to derail their investigation while at the same kissing the butt of the mayor (Robert Ridgely) to further his career and  reputation.

Like I said, Beverly Hills Cop 2 has alot of action.  There are gun fights, car chases and everything  found in a good action flick.

However, I also liked the fact that all the characters  were back in the film and that all of them were as  close as ever.

Billy Rosewood, the nice and anal friend of Taggart,  has become a wannabee Rambo type guy collecting  guns and weapons leading to Taggart telling him  that ""We need to talk"". lol

However, Billy and Taggart in the last film do become  helpful in helping Axel, along with giving us a couple  of good laughs.

Axel (Eddie Murphy) is again at his comical best, doing everything legal and illegal to find out whose behind  his friend's shooting and bringing them down hard.

All in all, Beverly Hills Cop 2 is a great sequel to the original. Many of the cool music tunes are back  along with a couple of new ones, plus the  film manages to recreate the hysterical  laughs from the first film and adds alot of action.

So here you have it: ""Beverly Hills Cop II,"" an unquestionably inferior sequel that still manages to be fun by rehashing some of the original's formula.  The main problem with ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" is the fact that Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is now friendly with at least half of the Beverly Hills police force.  Not so the case the first time around, since it was the very fact that he was unwelcome to begin with that made his tearing up of the culture the crucial crux of the comedy.  Another weakness is the fact that this film's script places more focus on the action than it does on the laughs.  This was a mistake for sure, since the comedy element is the original's greatest strength, as well as that of the cast.  All is not lost however.  This movie still manages to pull off some very funny gags thanks to the energy and timing of Murphy (still in his heyday) and of co-stars John Ashton and Judge Reinhold as the loveable Taggart and Rosewood.  It is clear that the actors are enjoying these characters and it shows in their scenes together.  There is a priceless moment at the Playboy Mansion featuring a cameo from Hefner himself.  Interestingly enough, according to an included interview with Hef, this was the first time that he allowed a major motion picture to be shot on the infamous property.

1180249,4,B000003KDD,"As sequels go, this one isn't bad. Eddie Murphy reprises his role as Axel Foley, a fast-talking, street-wise Detroit detective. It seems that Andy Bogomil (Ronnie Cox), the Beverly Hills detective captain who gave him a one-way pass out of town at the end of ""Beverly Hills Cop"", has discovered a clue to a series of high-profile heists. It also seems that he and Axel are now bosom buddies. They are planning a week-long fishing trip together and Axel is chummy with Bogomil's family (at least the ""family"" represented by an attractive blond daughter). When Bogomil is gunned down, Axel hops the next plane to L.A. to get the perpetrator.
Throughout what follows, fans of the original ""Beverly HIlls Cop"" are in familiar territory. Along with Murphy and Cox, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and several others from ""BHC"" are back in their familiar roles. Paul Reiser gets an expanded part. Axel again has his way with Beverly Hills, providing some funny moments along the way. There's also plenty of action. But, where ""BHC"" was breaking new ground as an action/comedy hybrid and in using Beverly Hills society as a foil for Murphy's inner-city antics, ""BHC2"" has sort of a ""used car"" feel. Further, it seems to me that ""BHC2"" is tilted a bit more toward the ""action"" part of the equation, with fewer funny moments than the original. Maybe that reflects the replacement of Martin Brest as director with Tony Scott. Or, maybe the gags just aren't quite as fresh or as funny this time around.
Then there are the ""bad guys"". These guys carry out tightly organized heists, timed to the second, but then are careless enough to leave distinctive, easy-to-trace shell casings around. And they're sooo cold-blooded. A bit over-the-top in the evilness department, but easy to hate.
""Beverly Hills Cop 2"" is a pretty good sequel. It tries to mine the same vein of material worked so well by the original ""BHC"" and, to a large degree, it succeeds. Check out ""BHC"" first. If you enjoy ""BHC"" you'll probably like the follow-up, too.",987552000,2,2017,4.832369942196531

1180253,3,B000003KDD,"Long ago, when Eddie Murphy was the biggest star in Hollywood, Beverly Hills Cop 2 was the most anticipated film of 1987. Movies like Trading Places and 48 Hours made Murphy famous. But Axel Foley made him a superstar. Impressed by Top Gun (even though it's a truly awful film), Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer brought Tony Scott on board to direct. What they forgot to do was polish the script.

Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help solve 'The Alphabet Crimes' after his old pal Lt. Bogomil is gunned down in the street. With Taggart and Rosewood in tow (now actually doing police work instead of standing by) Axel uncovers a seriously convoluted conspiracy.

The story should have taken a back seat to allow Murphy to work over the massive holes in the plot with his distracting wisecracks. I won't lie to you, there are some utterly horrible contrivances in BHC2 (Bogomil's daughter digging up dirt at the insurance company she just happens to work at is honestly the most obnoxious movie coincidence of all time), but you'll just have to suffer them.

This might have been easy to overlook, but Tony Scott, still finding his feet as a director, and his editors turn a great deal of the film into an incomprehensible mess. Some of the continuity errors are just baffling (where did Rosewood get the coffee cup from at the night club crash scene?) and it makes the action quite hard to follow.

However, Tony Scott's highly visual style of filmmaking is far more suiting to this kind of environment. The wealth and decadence of late 80s California is all over this movie, and it's the only aspect where it improves on the original. I doubt the latter day Scott would make the movie this way, but it's definitely the best looking of the trilogy. It's also the only one to be shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio (however it's Super35 instead of the superior anamorphic Panavision format).
