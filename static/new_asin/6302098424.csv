427118,5,6302098424,"I LOVE it!. There's absolutely nothing bad to be said about this wonderful film. It's one of the 10 best movies ever made, and it's lost none of its magic.(I like it just a tiny bit more, than that other famous 50's  fantasy/adventure favorite of mine: ""20.000 Leagues Under The  Sea"".) When I'm with Mason & co., I'm like a little kid again.  There are movies you never stop loving; and this is one of them for me.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore. If you're ""old and  wise"", I trust you'll agree.(I'm 32, by the way.) -They can show me  all their latest computer effects, I don't care, they're all empty like a  balloon, and they have no soul. Any kind of real and interesting magical  atmosphere, is almost impossible to capture in modern movies. Older films  have a facinating, almost other-worldly quality to them. It all boils down  to the look of a movie, and today they all look the same. Sad, but true.  -At least one can spend the rest of his or hers life, watching nothing but  old movies; and that's just exactly what I intend to do.",934329600,33,1056,4.38659793814433

427221,5,6302098424,"I purchased this for Amazon streaming.  I first saw this in high school in 1965.  It is an old classic that I have watched over and over.  Now my 9 year old grandson is hooked on it to.  For us, it never gets old, despite being made in 1959.  Since it isn't always available, I just went ahead and purchased it for $4.99.  Well worth the price for our movie nights!  Just add popcorn and Twizzlers!  Or any movie night favorite!",1496880000,,428,4.197530864197531
427222,1,6302098424,"The quality of the transfer to Bluray was very ordinary, it actually looks like a DVD.",1496275200,,86,4.4375
427224,4,6302098424,"Journey to the Center of The Earth has never been a favorite film of mine, It seems to drag for the most part, it's too long and while the effects are pretty decent (for the time), Boy!  Do I wish Ray Harryhausen had been in charge of the effects (and the film for that matter). I've never been a fan of the ""lizard with fins glued to it's back"" trick and I find them a poor substitute for stop motion dinosaurs. They are done well in this film and it works. Yes, I know even Ray has used this technique when budget constraints wouldn't allow him to use his stop motion magic, but this film had a pretty sizable budget.

This film has had it's share of problems on home video, none have been very satisfactory visually. Twilight Time's second release of this film was given a 4K transfer and I must say it is very impressive. Please bare in mind that this film has a lot of effects shots and they are only going to look as good as the original source material will allow. I can say first hand that this film has never even come close to looking this good on home video.

The improvements start with the opening of the film, the lettering is red, it has been orange on every edition I can remember. The earth looks a little darker than previous editions even the previous Twilight Time blu ray release, but it adds to the ominous overtones of the score in the opening credits. The transfer retains its grain and film look which is most welcome, I didn't detect any dirt or damage on this print at all.

Unfortunately that is where the positives end, the only bonus is a trailer, I'm grateful it was included, but it would have been nice to have some sort of feature for this 1959 spectacle especially with a retail price of $35.00 shipped from TT. The item is out of print and fetching a hefty price, but it can be found fairly reasonable if you look around. If you're a fan of this film, this is the version you want. The 2015 Twilight Time 4K edition Blu Ray, but be prepared to shell out a few bucks for it.",1492646400,,2009,4.2513089005235605

427226,5,6302098424,"This was a real find for me. For years I've had 3 movie titles on a post-it-note that I really wanted on Blu-Ray. This was one of them and I regularly checked for it on Amazon.  When I found it a few weeks ago I was sceptical but when I got it I was absolutely thrilled. Apparently, they only made 3000 of these Journey to the Center of the Earth Blu-Rays and this was one of them with original packaging, inserts and the quality was perfect.  Yea!!!

427317,3,6302098424,"An okay sci-fi film adaptation of Verne's work that skirts the gray area of A- to B+ film making, with some high points.  My only real critique of this edition is that the so-called blu-ray is NOTHING MORE than a mere duplication of the DVD edition master onto bluray disc format.

I've seen this movie lots of times, and it's always enjoyable on a certain level, but lacks some energy that moves other sci-fi films of the 1960s a bit more.  The scenes are tied together nicely, but overall the pacing is a bit slow, though I suspect that's because of Jules Verne original story, and not so much the screenplay that was adapted from his work.

The scenes that propel the stories in other films like ""The Time Machine"" or ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" or ""Jason and the Argonauts"" lack the spirit of those films, but still have enough energy to keep the story moving forward, and even allow us to look at the characters a bit more than other films of the same genre would allow.

The Special Effects for the time are on par with other effects of other films, though I do have to say that it appears that an iguana was harmed or killed for the sake of the film.  Fortunately this is not a practice that  would be tolerated today.

All in all the film is just a touch slow for most audiences, but is an okay watch for science fiction fans.  A bit more mature than ""At the Earth's Core"", though again the image here is poorly presented in bluray format.  Hopefully another company will buy the property and give us a proper bluray presentation.

An okay film that deserves better treatment.",1478217600,3,1590,4.410958904109589

I can do without Pat Boone singing but it's still a hoot! Arlene Dahl was excellent. The giant lizard scene was overdone but the director was probably in love with the special effects available in 1959. Fun movie overall.,1461110400,,360,4.553846153846154

427985,5,6302098424,"I don't think the price is justified, but the movie is 1950s classic. I KNOW it doesn't closely follow the book. Get OVER it! It was done in a way acceptable to the people with the power to make it happen. I'd much rather have this version than none at all. If I want to sate my purist appetite I will go read the book again. However, instead of badmouthing the film for what it ISN'T, I choose to enjoy it for what it is. This is one of a handful of movies from that time that should be in anyone's video collection who enjoyed the ""cheesyness"" of the 50s. I also imagine anyone who down rates this movie due to the cheese factor or non CG effects is a youngster with no appreciation for whence it all came.",1456963200,,708,4.100719424460432

428709,4,6302098424,"I'm going to review what you get from the Twilight Time release and not the movie itself because Journey to the Center of the Earth is already known to be one of the greatest adventure/scifi films ever made. I happily shelled out the money ($30, that is) to see it on bluray. Surprisingly, I was more impressed by the sound than image quality probably because I already knew it was a visual feast in cinematography. But I have to say, the ""commentary"" was a letdown. If you want to hear about Diane Baker's career OTHER THAN this movie and Bernard Herrman's career OTHER THAN this movie then you will have no complaints. This is one of those commentaries, using the term loosely, when the people brought in rarely comment on the scenes (in this case maybe once every 15-20 minutes) and very briefly at that. Very little background is exposed about the making of the movie. Pat Boone is still alive and kicking and Twilight Time really blew it by not
bringing him in on this! The man's in practically every scene of this classic and would have tales to tell, I'm sure. Now Diane Baker is charming and intelligent, but she is in very little of the movie and so, not surprisingly, her comments have little to do with the film. I tried 3 or 4 time to make it through this ""commentary"" and the final straw was from Gertrude's death to the climactic eruption toward the end. At this point it's like listening to a rather snobbish dinner party conversation while the TV running the movie has been left on in the other room with the sound turned off. I found this disturbingly disrespectful of this extraordinary classic movie! The lack of Pat Boone is stunningly disappointing. This omission made this a package with a content of just the movie and a trailer, no big deal. Journey to the Center of the Earth deserves much more.",1442102400,3,1820,4.551829268292683

428765,5,6302098424,One of my favorite films.,1437523200,,25,4.2
428766,4,6302098424,"For an ""Old Movie"", Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) holds up pretty well.  It takes Jules Verne's subject seriously enough to keep a good element of drama in the film, but has enough light moments to make it very ""Family Friendly"".  To be honest though, some the visual effects are ""dated"", especially the encounter with the dinosaurs, but they are good enough to not take you out of the movie.

The story is also very dated in its portrayal of women. Admittedly, this film was made in the fifties about Scotland in the 1880s, but it is very startling to see in the light of today and the prominence that women have on the world stage.  Again, for the type of entertainment that it is, it does provide an interesting time capsule for the attitudes of the day toward women for those who were not around witness or too young to understand  the evolution of women from the sixties to now.

This is one of my favorite performances by James Mason. He treats the material with a degree of seriousness that makes his character very engaging and credible. His performance here is easily as good in his other work in another Jules Verne classic Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" as Captain Nemo of the Nautilus which he made in 1954.

With todays frenetic film pace that can leave you exhausted by the time you exit the theater, this film builds slowly and deliberately. The pacing of this film is slow in comparison and there are times when the film seems to drag, but it is to good purpose to allow the viewer to digest the visual magnificence of the journey.  This pacing also helps to immerse the viewer in the sense of exploring the wonders found by the characters in the film.

The bottom line is that Journey to the Center of the Earth is very much worth the price of the rental. If you have a High Definition television, I highly recommend viewing the HD version for $3.99.  The fact that you can watch the film at any time for a month with an Amazon Prime membership makes it a bargain.  Odds are that if you have never seen the film before, you will want to watch it again within that month time frame.  The movie makes a great center piece for a family afternoon or evening activity. It also is a fun film for those who appreciate when film was more interested in the craft of a story and visuals that you could see nowhere else versus constant breakneck action.  For full disclosure, I am a huge fan of those Fast Paced Action films as well, but with that being said, I really like enough in this film to say that I actually enjoyed watching it, and plan to watch it again.",1436745600,8,2592,4.397489539748954

The movie still holds up for my kids' imaginations. They don't mind the old school special effects at all. And the acting is very enjoyable. It's not super-close to Jules Verne's book, but the changes made are still in the spirit of it. So fun to share a classic I liked as a kid, and find that they like it, too! Thinking of buying it, instead of renting it.",1434326400,,545,4.396039603960396
428769,4,6302098424,"I remember watching this film years ago when I was much younger. I didn't quite appreciate all that went into it at the time but did enjoy it. Now that Im much older I find that JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is a much better picture than I recalled and a fine tribute to the author of the book it was based on, Jules Verne.

If youve read anything by Verne you know that he was far ahead of his time when it came to science fiction writing. Many of the concepts and ideas he created have come to be in real life. While the idea of a vast underground in the middle of the earth isn't one of those, this adventurous tale does entertain.

In 1888 at Edinburgh University Professor Oliver Lindenbrook (James Mason) has just been knighted and is hailed by his students for his accomplishments. Student Alec McKuen (Pat Boone) has been selected to present him with a gift, an inkwell made from a set of ram horns, and with the change left over has picked up an interesting rock found in a nearby shop as well. The rock sets in motion the rest of the film as Lindenbrook, while looking at the rock, discovers that it surrounds a small item inside with an inscription on it. Through a series of events the item is dislodged and appears to be a plumb bob with an inscription from an ancient Scandinavian archeologists who theorized the earth was hollow with another world inside the outer one.

Lindenbrook and McKuen set off to find the location described on the item but are in a race once they learn that the man Lindenbrook wrote to for help has already set off to make the discovery for himself thus taking credit for it. Things change when he is found murdered in his hotel room. When his widow arrives (Arlene Dahl), Lindenbrook offers to purchase all of the equipment his colleague left behind. She agrees on one condition, that she accompany him on the search.

Having yet discovered who was responsible for the murder, as well as trapping Lindenbrook and McKuen in a nearby building, the three set off accompanied by a bracing young man Lindenbrook has hired to help carry their supplies. It turns out that the murderer is Saknussemm (Thayer David), the descendant of the man who set out to discover this world long ago and who was responsible for sending out the item Lindenbrook found. Now both teams are competing to make the discovery of the world at the center of the earth first. Unfortunately for Lindenbrook, Saknussemm is willing to do anything to get there first.

Slow moving by todays standards the movie lets its tale unravel at a pace that dwells more on story than on action. Dont get me wrong, Im not saying thats a bad thing. It just may be off putting to some. But for those willing to watch from start to finish you won't be disappointed. Instead youll find a well thought out tale written by one of the greatest authors who ever lived.

The effects will seem simple to most raised on a steady diet of CGI these days. Split screen images offering cowering people facing off against huge lizards standing in for dinosaur size reptiles don't seem to have that real look to them, but were plenty amazing for audiences for audiences at the time. And for some they will hold up today as well. The set designs in some of the various lands they discover while under the earths shell will also delight not just the eye but the imagination as well.

It would be simple to say that the acting is outstanding but come on, James Mason? Can anyone say anything bad about the mans acting skills? What is more surprising is the performance of Pat Boone who was little more than a teen heartthrob at the time. He does a fine job here holding his own against both Mason and Dahl who had many more years of experience. And Thayer David does a great job as well, long before he became famous for his years on DARK SHADOWS.

The movie is being released by Twilight Time which means if you are interested in picking up a copy do so soon. They consistently limit the number of copies to their collectors editions to 3,000 pieces and once gone they're gone. Knowing that it is from Twilight Time youll also be guaranteed that the quality of the disc will be blu-ray and the extras will be just as good. While the extras here are limited there is the isolated score soundtrack composed by Bernard Herrmann as well as a commentary track featuring Diane Baker who plays Boones love interest in the film. This one, as with almost all Twilight Time offerings, is worth adding to your collection.",1433894400,3,4492,4.482885085574572

James Mason and Arlene Dahl turn in fine performances within the limits of their characters. And who knew then that a young Pat Boone could do anything but sing?

429392,4,6302098424,"Backed by a superb score from Bernard Herrmann, 20th Century Fox's old-fashioned Jules Verne adventure JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH arrives on Blu-Ray this month from Twilight Time in a limited edition release that ought to be gobbled up by Golden Age fans and genre aficionados alike.

The free adaptation of Verne's novel from writer-producer Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and director Henry Levin stars James Mason as a Victorian era professor who, after getting his hands on a meteorite with an inscription from a long-lost explorer, leads an expedition into the center of the Earth including student Pat Boone, widow Arlene Dahl, and a precocious duck named Gertrude.

Shot after Disney's classic ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" Fox's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" isn't on the level of that Richard Fleischer-directed `50s staple, but it's an engaging and leisurely paced fantasy that will primarily appeal to nostalgic viewers (I'm not sure younger viewers will be able to tolerate the at-times languid pacing, though the humor and adventure is certainly suitable for kids). In fact, lighthearted humor and engaging turns from Mason and Boone carry us through the film's first third; once the journey gets cracking, nearly a full hour has passed before the group engage in a series of adventures through dark caverns, underground waterfalls, giant mushrooms and, ultimately, decidedly less-than-fantastic lizards masquerading as dinosaurs (effects that I was quite disappointed in when I saw the film on TV, as a kid, back in the `80s).

 ""Journey"" seems to be most admired by baby boomers who grew up on the picture, with its strongest attribute being Herrmann's majestic, marvelous score, which kept me glued through a fresh viewing via Twilight Time's superb Blu-Ray package.

The AVC encoded 1080p transfer from the Fox vaults generally displays a good deal of HD detail compared to its DVD counterpart. The print itself isn't in completely pristine condition - a line (just off-center to the right) of the frame appears for several minutes beginning at the 40 minute mark, and there are assorted speckles and understandable issues stemming from the myriad of different special effects processes involved - but the framing is accurate, colors are strong and very little DNR has been applied. This ""Journey"" resembles real, honest to goodness film, and looks so much better than my ancient laserdisc release that it appears to be a different film altogether (credit a restoration Fox performed on the film over a decade ago). The 4.0 DTS MA soundtrack effectively conveys Herrmann's score and boasts directional dialogue faithful to its original stereo mix, while two trailers, an isolated score track, and Julie Kirgo's retrospective notes add the perfect touch to the package.",1336953600,12,2806,5.212860310421286
429393,5,6302098424,"It has been over 50 years since Twentieth Century Fox ventured below the earth's surface - riding on the coat-tails of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Around the World in Eighty Days"".  With on-location shooting at Carlsbad Caverns, Edinburgh, Scotland (and environs), and other locations in and around southern California, the fabulous journey was enhanced with the appearances of James Mason as Sir Oliver S. Lindenbrook, Arlene Dahl as Carla Guteberg, Pat Boone as Alexander ""Alec"" McKuen, Peter Ronson as Hans Belker, Thayer David as Count Saknussem, Diane Baker as Jenny Lindenbrook, and Ivan Triesault as Professor Guteberg and the superior settings that reflect the overly adequate budget.  Even the dimetrodons reflect some realistic ingenuity - while it may have been a temptation to look to Super Dynamation.

This was to be my favorite adventure as a youngster - although, later in life, it was evident that the journey was, in reality, quite improbable.  I can only imagine how many times I've seen it - thoroughly enjoying it in every format.  The fact that Bernard Herrmann scored this film with a brilliant composition adds to the awesome ""depth"" of the picture.  The superlative score exists as an isolated track with this restoration. The fantasy of it all - a virtual cast of volcanoes, colorful precipices, a jewel-laden grotto, three men alone with Arlene Dahl (and a duck) - it just doesn't get any better than this.

This Twilight Time offering is crisp and flawless - with magnificent scene enhancement.  The scenes at the underground, jewel-encrusted grotto, the scene with the adventurers clinging along a rock escarpment, and the scene where the expedition gathers near the fallen arch where it is assumed that Alec McKuen has fallen to his death are great examples where this restoration really sparkles.  The picture is actually much better than I remember it as a kid and I am really looking forward to what Twilight Time has in mind for future restorations/releases - maybe ""The Time Machine""...",1336694400,9,2029,5.087349397590361

The film itself is great; it's a classic that I've loved since I was little.  My issue is with the video transfer.  When you have a file size of 2.2 gigs, there's absolutely no reason that the image should be so blocky and pixelated, nor that the sound should be wavering so much.  There are so many compression techniques available that actually create smaller files of higher quality -- .avi and .mkv for example -- that the use of such a substandard compression technique is inexplicable to me.  If this video is representative of the quality available through Amazon Unbox, I won't be downloading any others.

To its credit the 1959 movie fixes some of the more egregious flaws but many of the parts where it stays true to the source material are quite silly, the silliest of them being the ending. From the two Verne books I've read the author seems to have little interest in female characters so I commend the film for adding a woman to the exploration party. Also, the discovered message from Icelandic explorer Arne Saknussemm about making it to the center of the Earth is found in an Italian volcano instead of Iceland lending credence to Saknussemm's claim to have at the very least descended far into the Earth while also allowing the possibility that he may not have managed to return to the surface alive.

So let's get down to brass tacks. This movie is from 1959 so the special effects are pretty weak. The dinosaurs are lizards with fins glued to their backs but sadly they still look better than the laughable CGI dinosaurs from the 2008 made for TV movie. I was amused by how fake most of the underground scenes look but in the closing credits they thanked Carlsbad Caverns so at least some of the movie was filmed on location. All in all the film GENERALLY keeps its dignity and the scenes of the underground sea are actually decently impressive. A movie like this really depends on acting and James Mason delivers some suitably tasty ham. Arlene Dahl gave my favorite performance and Pat Boone basically smiled and looked wholesome even as he spent most of the movie shirtless.

What I really liked was the dynamic between Mason and Dahl which was created for the film. Her husband, a competing explorer, was attempting to sabotage Mason and Boone's trip underground when he himself was killed by another even more ruthless party. Dahl's husband had bought up all the equipment in the area necessary for a journey underground so Mason had to make a deal with her for the equipment that included bringing her along. I liked the idea that they were bringing along the widow of their rival, unfortunately the dead husband was soon forgotten and in the end Mason and Dahl ended up in a full fledged romance. The film also added a murderous member of the Saknussemm family who didn't care for others trying to horn in on his family's discovery.

In the book the explorers completely failed to get to the center of the Earth managing to only get about 1/40th of the way to the core. The film tries to correct this by having them supposedly arrive at the ""magnetic"" center of the Earth which existed somewhere in the middle of the underground sea yanking all their metal away with goofy cartoon sound effects. One problem from the book was the positively absurd amount of supplies they brought including 50 pounds of gunpowder. In the film they find the gunpowder having been carried by the previous Saknussemm expedition. Also, the film gives a somewhat more satisfying conclusion in that it's confirmed that they managed to journey exactly as far as Saknussemm. Unfortunately they were expelled from the Earth in the same manner as in the book which included riding an eruption all the way out of the Earth. You see them shooting up the lava tube (which is REALLY silly) but are spared the sight of them flying forth from the volcano. Apparently Pat Boone not only flew all the way out of the volcano but landed in a tree unharmed far enough away from the volcano that the nuns who discover him are unconcerned about an erupting volcano. This is definitely the silliest part of the movie but sadly it's true to the book.

The film is enjoyable in a retro kind of way but not thrilling. I'm looking forward to seeing the Brendan Frasier version because the story would lend itself well to some silly popcorn action which doesn't quite jibe with the book since it felt like Verne was taking it all very seriously. It is possible he wrote this book as humorous satire but if so he kept it subtle.",1305676800,2,4080,4.6143250688705235

429488,4,6302098424,"After two successful adaptations of Jules Verne novels, ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" it is only natural that 20th Century Fox decided on producing a big-budget adventure tale based on the same novelist's work. Quite ambitious by the standard of its day ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" still remains entertaining even if some part of it look very corny today.

Like any Verne novels you have read, the title tells you everything about the story. The expedition team led by a renowned professor Oliver Lindenbrook descends deep into the Earth, and they find extraordinary things like a cave with huge mushrooms and giant lizards. As no CGI was available, of course, the ""giant"" lizard is actually a real one that tries to look much bigger with a camera trick, but you should remember this was made in 1959.

The cast including James Mason, Pat Boone, Arlene Dahl, and Diane Baker may look strange now, for the story is set in 19th century Edinburgh, Scotland. Pat Boone's role as geology student who assists the professor looks even curious when his Scottish accent comes and suddenly goes (and he sings a song too, a Robert Burns poem), but he was one of the most popular teenage idols those days before the Fab Four arrived in USA. By the way, the same formula casting idol singer would be repeated three years later, with Irwin Allen-directed Jules Verne adventure tale ""Five Weeks in a Balloon"" that feature Cerdic Hardwick and Fabian (!).

The effects look cheesy now, the pace is slow for most modern viewers, and the film's slightly comical touch may not amuse you, but the fact remains that ""Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is still quite entertaining. I loved it when watching it as a kid, and I find it still fun to see it.",1151712000,5,1794,4.670886075949367
429489,5,6302098424,"Just as Jules Verne was ahead of his time, almost prophetically, this 1959 movie remains as one of the best fun-action movies of all time.  In an era which slowly moved from black/white sci-fi flics to color and better special effects, this color-version is still top drawer.

James Mason was the perfect selection for the condescending lead.  And real-life clean-cut Pat Boone was perfect for his puppy-eyed follower (and several opportunities to showcase his singing voice fit well, and did not make this border on a musical).  But the best justaposition was the freshly widowed, feisty (including her flowing red hair), and humbly-attractive ""Karla.""

Diane Baker as Pat Boone's heart-throb, and the lanky and loyal Icelander guy, round out the good guys.  In addition to the good-guy subplots, the descendant of their gone-before explorer, is perfectly dastardly and equally condescending.  Watch the sparks fly (and the lava)!

If you can catch all of the verbal barbs and coy lines in the first few times you see this gem, I'll give you double your money back.  This movie has one of the best scripts you'll ever hear!

This vid has everything you'd want in a great family movie: fun action, people at odds, subplots, crisp photography, attractive scenes, just enough characters, and a plot that takes you where you've never been.

429560,5,6302098424,"This is one of the best films of the 50's Science Fiction genre.  Having been based on the Jules Verne book by the same name, it's no wonder the film was so good. With actors like Pat Boone and James Mason, the film is top notch. I think James Mason captured the classic idea of the British scientist, always on the quest for knowledge at whatever personal cost.
I think this film, even with it's very old special effects, is better than the newest retelling of the Verne story that was made in the late 1990's starring Treat Williams.
One thing that bugs me though, is where is the DVD? I have a collection of classic 50's Sci-Fi, and there is an empty spot where this DVD should be sitting, right between 'The Time Machine' and 'Creature from the Black Lagoon'.",1038355200,,763,4.411347517730497
429561,5,6302098424,"A great classic film that has it all--entertaining interpretation of a classic story, cheeky characters with quirky idiosyncrasies, great adventure, cheesy acting, and great special effects for its time.  This is a film my brother and I grew up with, and of course, as cheesy as it is, we watch it repeatedly and bring a certain ""MST"" commentary to each sitting.  A very young Pat Boone presents a whimsical, anachronistic portrayal of a young Scotsman with an eager albeit nave loyalty to Professor Lindenbrook (James Mason).  The fact that Pat Boone released his ""In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy"" album makes watching the film even more entertaining.  I can only imagine young Alec playing his accordion to ""Crazy Train"" while descending to the center of the earth.
Another Amazon.com reviewer said concerning this film ""Warning. It can be addicting.""  This is VERY true.  If boredom ever strikes me, for some reason, this film seems to fill the void.
Overall, this is a great film.  A classic sci-fi film that puts the 1999 version to shame.  If you want a good old-fashioned sci-fi flick, this is the one to get.  Watch it with your kids.  Watch it with family.  Convince your girlfriend that this is the most incredible movie in the world (she'll be swooned to the Robert Burns poetry).

429562,5,6302098424,"There are movies that may have been designed for a young audience but sometimes the best of these have a way of growing on you so that the passing of the years adds to, rather than detracts from, the pleasurable frequency of viewing them.  JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is just such a movie.  Unlike its more modern update with Treat Williams as the lead, this journey manages to combine the thrill of youthful wonderment with engrossing characters.  Jules Verne's novel of the same name posits a world within a world that allows for established science to mingle with science fiction.  Director Henry Levin took Verne's book and faithfully recreated a superb version for the screen that earned three Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction, Set Direction, and Sound.
  Professor Oliver Lindenbrook (James Mason) is a professor of geology who leads an expedition through a tunnel to retrace the steps of Arne Saknussen, who many years earlier hiked literally to the center of the earth.  The film conveniently ignores the established laws that dictate an increasingly higher temperature as one travels downward through the mantle.  Yet, even knowing this does not detract from the sheer spectacle of the trek.  Accompanying Lindenbrook is Alec McEwan (Pat Boone), a guide Hans (Peter Ronson) and Mrs. Goetaborg (Arlene Dahl).  Unknown to them, they are pursued by the villanous descendant of Arne Saknussen who wishes to claim the entire Center of the earth for his own. The thrust of the film is a combination of a cat-and-mouse game as Count Saknussen lays trap after trap for the Lindenbrook expedition with a growing sense of nonstop  subterranean spectacles.  The viewer sees, among other sights, an underground ocean, dinosaurs, gorgeous cavern rocks, and the lost city of Atlantis.  James Mason, with his suave urbane sense of self and polished diction, is the perfect choice as Professor Lindenbrook.  Pat Boone proves that his acting is not far behind his singing.  And Arlene Dahl looks good in hiking clothes, even after many months underground.  Behind the glittery surface level of spectacle and action, the film also has a subtext on the value of education.  Time and again, the expedition avoids disaster only because one of them knew one tidbit or other about science.  Seeing JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH not only entertains you about the wonder of science, it also suggests that science and education can pay off where it counts: in the purse and in the soul.",1030665600,,2489,4.971014492753623

As the intrepid band descends into the earth's core, they find sparkling caverns, an underground ocean, and even the lost city of Atlantis, all the time being followed by an unscrupulous explorer.

This is good, clean fun for the whole family.  Pat Boone was at the height of his singing career in 1962 and does a good job here, but Mason is the real star.  He brings maturity and class to the film while Dahl is the essence of plucky femininity.

There are many comic moments and lots of minor thrills as the group encounters the inevitable prehistoric monsters.

James Mason is superb in his role as Prof. Lindenbrook. Arlene Dahl is great and a perfect match for Mason. Pat Boone is a bit goofy, but is fine in his role.
Yes, the movie strays quite a bit from the book, but this is Hollywood and that happens to the best of books. On it's own the movie is a joy to watch.

Another good thing about the dinosaurs is that they are not all over the place. They take up a little less than 15 minutes of screen time. The sets are simply breathtaking. A funny part of the movie is when the professor taps Morse code to a duck. Also, he walks by a bagpipe band without even knowing it!
The movie is somewhat sexist (""All women hear things. Up there!""). But that is probably similar to what happened in the late 19th century.

And then there's the  lost city of Atlantis, giant lizards, and of course Gertrude the duck.  There are enough differences to fill an Olympic swimming pool, but really,  only the purists would be offended by all these massive differences.
