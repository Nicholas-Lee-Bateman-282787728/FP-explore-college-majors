750413,5,6303957056,"This is a delightfully engaging movie and I personally consider it a vital part of Americana. Life of the typical middle class family making it big when they win a radio quiz show and how it then impacts their lives. Then there is the taxman...

Good wholesome entertainment for the whole family as well as a candid look at what life was like in the 1940s. I recommend this film highly.

I only wish that this film could somehow be transferred into DVD format or packaged into a Jimmy Stewart movie collection. For its entertainment value and for its charming rendition of life in the 40s, this film is a treasure of a bygone era.",1132876800,41,630,4.469565217391304
750414,3,6303957056,"Jimmy Stewart & Barbara Hale keeps the plot moving. I really enjoyed watching it. Natalie Wood was kind of ""dorky"", but her little brother ""Tommy"" was a better actor. The overall movie is ""delightfully cute"".  Barbara Hale shows her ""versatility"" for acting.",1026345600,31,258,5.142857142857143
750415,5,6303957056,"One of Jimmy Stewart's most overlooked films. This picture is pure 1950's. Stewart is an overworked family man, (Similar to his role in Mr. Hobbs Takes A Vacation, but The Jackpot is a much better picture.) who wins a  radio game show. Prizes range from the useful to the absurd. Everything is  fine until he finds out he's got to pay taxes on all of his loot. Probably  as much pure fun as any Jimmy Stewart picture.",911260800,63,417,4.3896103896103895
750508,5,6303957056,"Love this movie I love James Stewart didn't even know this movie existed
I like the whole money thing and the taxes boy!!! Times haven't changed much can relate......Love  this movie",1392940800,,182,4.870967741935484
750509,5,6303957056,"Wonder to see on dvd one of James Stewart's best ones really enjoyed the whole story line, worth purchasing for sure.",1389484800,,117,4.619047619047619
750510,5,6303957056,"The misadventures of a married man to pay his income taxes after winning a 24,000 $ jackpot in prizes  in playing at a radio quizz.
A wonderful and funny comedy with James Stewart and Barbara Hale to spend a good time in family.",1381968000,,228,4.3023255813953485
750511,5,6303957056,"This is a cute comedy starring; James Stewart, Barbara Hale, James Gleason, Fred Clark, Alan Mowbray, Patricia Medina and a young Tommy Rettig and Natalie Wood. 20th Century Fox did a great job on this transfer with pretty good picture. The film is presented in b&w, full frame and runs for about 85mins. Overall this is a great film and I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of these stars or fan of old films in general.",1381017600,2,425,4.3924050632911396
750512,5,6303957056,"This is a little known comic gem elevated by a bravura performance by James Stewart.  Ironically this takes a backseat to ""Harvey"" as his best comic work in 1950.  The premise is pretty simple.  Small town Indiana husband wins $24,000.00 in prizes by answering a question correctly on a radio quiz show.  At first it's an embarrassment of riches.  Where do you put the Shetland pony?  Then the tax implications set in.  Then trying to sell the bounty.  In the process Stewart commiserates with gangsters, spends a night in jail, and watches his marriage fall apart.  Makes one wish for the rut you were complaining about in the first scene.  Everyman Stewart's work here is maniacal comic inspiration.  Trivia buffs should note the presence of a young Natalie Wood, Tommy Rettig(""Lassie"") and Barbara Hale(""Perry Mason"").  A real keeper.",1381017600,,837,4.9855072463768115
750513,4,6303957056,"This is a great film and the DVD is a keeper. I was very thankful for this product and it's availability. The only thing I can think of that would add value and convenience is subtitles or captions, which are not available on this DVD. But classic movie fans and James Stewart fans will not be disappointed!",1378598400,2,307,4.4035087719298245
750514,3,6303957056,Quality of the DVD was very clean and clear.  Voice also came out very good.  Story has problems feeding through into modern times but it was made to catch the attention to those people who use to listen to radio give aways which were extremely popular during that period of time.,1362528000,2,280,4.470588235294118
750515,4,6303957056,I Love these old movies. They do not make them like this any more. Good clean stuff. If you like good clean movies get this one.,1339632000,5,128,3.9615384615384617
750516,5,6303957056,"This is pure fun from start to end. A bit corny, perhaps but with James Stewart, who cares?  I is a shame it's not out yet on DVD, however, if you have TMC or FMC ( not sure which one) and a DVR, keep your eyes open. every now and they they play it. It's a great way to have a copy until they have on DVD and buy it here at Amazon.

You read enough of the other reviews so there is not much more I can add, just share this little tip I hope you take. It is not on often like most movies so keep on looking, The times they will honor Stewart when his birthday comes no doubt they will play it then, if not sooner.

750517,5,6303957056,"JACKPOT is a hilarious peek into the private lives of a normal family in 1950 made suddenly mad by winning a big radio prize. This is great family fun and deserves a place in your collection. Why it has not yet been released on DVD is a mystery to me. However, if you have never seen it -- don't wait and purchase the VHS copy, because it's just that good.",1137024000,15,356,4.1
7858129,5,6303957056,"A very enjoyable, funny James Stewart movie that is relatively unknown. At least it was unknown to me. One of my favorite movies of his (and of all time) is ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and I find a similar theme here about being content with what you have, except to get out of his rut in this movie (which is a humdrum job rather than Bedford Falls) was to be given too much instead of having everything, including his identity, taken away from him. Highly recommended for James Stewart fans -- and for those who like old fashioned clean comedies with heart along with a touch of cynicism.",1514332800,,587,4.444444444444445
