Beautifully restored romantic, musical comedy. Another excellent quality transfer from DigiComTV. Hilarious, madcap comedy set in the 1940s featuring Jimmy Stewart as a failing music store owner whose insanely funny uncle wants him to join his food factory business. Stewart winds up befriending his uncles worst nightmare  a family of Irish musicians who are constantly practicing, and unnerving the music-hating uncle whose food factory is right next door.

One thing leads to another and Stewart and his uncle wind up jailed over a tomato-throwing incident gone awry. In the midst of all this chaos is beautiful Paulette Goddard, who is also a member of the musical Irish family next door. She finds herself getting caught up not only in Stewarts problems, but the uncles as well. Goddard is totally unaware that Stewart and his uncle are related. This she finds out at toward the end of the film. In the meantime, she begins to fall in love with Stewart as the speed of comedic events begin to pick up.

Stewart finds himself trying to help the Irish family get gigs. He ends up placing them on his uncles radio show while he has cleverly shuffled his music-hating uncle off to Canada. The radio show is a big success with the Irish musicians, and Goddard decides to announce there will be a $1,000 giveaway every week on the program. Now, how does one sort out this mess? Giving away money on a radio show is illegal.

Hijinks abound as Stewart and Goddard try to figure out how they are going to legally give away $1,000 a week. The uncle returns from Canada just as they have figured out a solution to the giveaway.

Happy endings for all when advertising sponsors want to purchase the successful program from the music-hating uncle, while at the same time Stewart announces his engagement to Goddard over the air.

This film is peppered throughout with absolutely hysterical scenes and madcap adventures. A real classic youll want to watch over and over. Its laughter and gaiety is as relevant now as it certainly was in the 1940s. This film will definitely keep you in stitches..",1434672000,,2136,4.819672131147541
