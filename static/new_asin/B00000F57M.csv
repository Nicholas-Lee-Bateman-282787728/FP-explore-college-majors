The video is insightful, and I really appreciate the nature shots,  It's all I expected from National Geographics.  The narration is excellent.  I absoutely have no complaints.

After watching the video there is a teaser at the end and I simply wish it had continued.  My students appreciated and learned a lot from this video.",1199232000,,378,4.552238805970149
