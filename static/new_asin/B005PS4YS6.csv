It arrived safely, albeit that it took a while to come to Australia.  I only used ordinary post and I am not sure how long that takes.  I thought the seller was very generous in only charging the standard item post charge even though this was a boxed set.  Would recommend seller as communication was superb at all times. Now looking forward to transcribing these discs from Region 2 to Region 4, so my friend has them for her birthday and can finally watch the genius of Jean Renoir - son of the famous Auguste - the unparalleled French impressionist painter.",1381708800,,713,4.419847328244275
