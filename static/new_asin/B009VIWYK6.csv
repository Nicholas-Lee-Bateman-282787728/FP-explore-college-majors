8544513,5,B009VIWYK6,Great original ECW ppv,1453334400,,22,4.75
8544514,5,B009VIWYK6,I went to this man i can't believe it's been 14 years since then I just remember having an awesome time with my best friend and the whole arena smelling like bud. I didn't even know it was ppv at the time let alone the last heatwave to happen I'm glad I went and was there good times,1393632000,,283,3.896551724137931
8544515,5,B009VIWYK6,"It should be noted that I don't have the actual RF Video release of this event as I watched either the original PPV broadcast or the Pioneer Home Video release of this event so I have no clue to any edits (music/entrances/interviews/ect.) that may or may not be on this release.

It took around 6 years but ECW finally made it's way to the west coast to present their HeatWave PPV in Los Angeles, CA with a small bit of controversy in itself which you saw during the opening minutes of the main event when the talent from the XPW promotion got into a confrontation with Francine causing the ECW locker room to empty out while it should also be noted that Dawn Marie joined Styles & Cyrus on commentary for the second half of this event which made Cyrus sound like he was stealing Joel Gertner's material with all the one-liners he had all night.  Tommy Dreamer challenged Justin Credible for the ECW Championship in a Stairway To Hell Ladder Match with barbed wire hanging at the top of the arena while Tommy Dreamer brought some extra company to take care of Francine in Jazz & Randy Savage's ex-girlfriend from WCW named George in what was the hardcore type of match you would expect from these two men while Francine was eventually beating out her clothes...literally.  Rob Van Dam returned home to California to face off against Scotty Anton (WCW's Scotty Riggs) in what was definitely the best match in Anton's entire career but it more memorable for the debut of RVD's new move called ""The Van Terminator.""  Sandman once again challenged Television Champion Rhino that saw the brawling go in & out of the ring with both men being very physical like Sandman destroying his cane over Rhino's head in the opening minute while both men attempted to use the guardrail in the ring to their advantage.  Other matches include Jerry Lynn vs. Steve Corino in a match that saw Lynn get more violent than we've previous seen from him to the point where he wrote ""DIE"" in Corino's own blood across his chest, an international 3 Way Dance with Psicosis vs. Little Guido vs. Yoshihiro Tajiri which various styles from lucha libre to stiff japanese to shoot wrestling that saw Mikey Whipwreck also make his presence known, Nova & Chris Chetti vs. Da Baldies, Kid Kash & Danny Doring & Roadkill vs. Simon Diamond & Swinger & C.W. Anderson, and Balls Mahoney vs. Big Sal E. Graziano.

ECW rebounded from the previous two events to deliver a high quality show here as a high majority of the matches were quality in their own right & all the talents seemed to step their game while the California crowd didn't seem out of place at all so I highly recommend this event.",1369353600,2,2654,4.600422832980972

8544518,3,B009VIWYK6,"The Ballz Mahony-Big Sal match was a dud to say the least. The Six man tag team match between The team of Simon Diamond,Johnny Swinger & CW Anderson against The team of Danny Doring,Amish Roadkill & Kid Kash was a good high energy bout. The Jerry Lynn-Steve Corino match was boring but it had a few good highspots. The tag team match between The Da Baldies against the team of Nova & Chris Chetti was not great but pretty good. The Yoshihiro Tajiri-Little Guido-Psicosis-Mikey Whipwreck 4 way match while not a bad match,it never really clicked or showed any kind of point. The TV Title match between Rhino & The Sandman was shockingly watchable until the stupid overbooking ruined everyone's fun. The Scotty Anton-Rob Van Dam was also not great but pretty good. The Stairway to Hell match for the ECW World title between Justin Credible & Tommy Dreamer was a smash-mouth,entertaining & ruthless bout. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1348272000,,932,4.689024390243903
