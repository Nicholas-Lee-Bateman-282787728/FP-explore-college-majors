8341904,5,B001TKK3HU,"Gundam 00 is a political anime. (which is a good thing in this case)However it's an action packed and HIGHLY suspenseful anime. It's set a few century's in the future where the world has become greatly advanced in medicine, and science, and no longer uses fossil fuels. With that being the case the Middle East had become impoverished. Meanwhile the world's major lands (U.S, Europe, and Asia) receive an unlimited source of energy from a solar tower that spans to outer space. Because of the infinite energy the tower gives off, the world's economy is thriving. Sadly there are countries that do not have access to the towers energy, these lands are at war with the top countries. Therefore terrorism, and civil wars still exist in the lesser lands. The solution to the world's largest remaining problem is to end war. So an organization calling themselves Celestial Being, made up of mysterious people that posses the technology of Gundams (advanced mobile suits) threaten all of the world's governments, organizations, and other military groups, that if there's is any more war being waged than they will intervene unbiased and destroy them. And their main goal is simply to end all wars. Doubt is immediatley casted over Celestial Beings intentions, and their effectiveness especially since they propose such a grand gesture. However with their superior mobile suits and the element of surprise they have a clear advantage. Character development is well done. It's paced well throughout the entire 1st season as to who each of the main gundam pilots(AKA GUNDAM MEISTERS) are and what happened in their backgrounds. The action is awesome, along with the crisp and sharp animation. The emotions are not over the top and overly dramatic like certain animes. However this is a serious anime, so there is simply no humor. But this isn't a bad thing. The suspense of the show is what makes it so addicting. The 1st episode is well done but to some it may seem overly political up until the final parts of the episode where everything is made a bit more clear. (Basically what I already explained earlier) The fun part about the show is seeing the mystery of Celestial Being unfold, and watching as they attempt to accomplish their agenda to end war. Especially seeing the reaction of the world's governments. There are very cool suprises in this show and some will catch you off guard in the most subtle ways. One of the best animes I've ever seen and THE best mech anime I've ever seen. It is very rewarding. This is an anime that will stay on your mind long after you watch it.",1464566400,,2577,4.806306306306307

8341906,5,B001TKK3HU,"I first saw gundam 00 on the Sci-Fi channel when they still did the anime night shows I've been watching through out. My familiarity with the gundam shows had me caught on with this one. The show takes place in the 2307 A.D. where fossil fuel had run and humanity now relies on solar power, the mysterious organization 'Celestial Being' posses the mobile suits known as Gundam and use them to commence armed intervention on a mission 'to eliminate war'. This DVD contains two discs of the first seasons, from Celestial Beings introduction to the Human Reform League's attempt to capture a Gundam.",1375142400,,596,4.796116504854369
8341907,5,B001TKK3HU,"ok, Gundam seed/destiny was ok, but i could not stand the constant whinning, crying and complaning about the pilot made to fight and going to war. it finally picked up alittle on destiny. ok, some crying on gundam 00 but from girls caring too much for the pilots =P

ok to the topic on hand. i'll keep it nice and short. gundam 00 is by comparison similar to gundam wing (obviously nothing will top wing) from the character personas to the gundam units themselves. (side note, the unit name zero and unit 00 or double-o is reference to gundam, WING zero. sort of a hint as to let you know which gundam is the strongest and lead gundam) the story consists of constant war raging on earth. at this time frame the military have mobile suits...not the high end gundams. a space group known as celestial being makes an appearance and the military are curious about these suits and want to apply them into their mobile suits so season one is all about capturing a gundam. celestial being wants to end all wars by intervening in all combat zones. basically fighting everyone. keep in mind there is a bigger plot to this group and what their actuall purpose is.

what keeps the the story interesting is by having season 2 take place two years after season 1. all the characters have physically and mentally changed and so has the world and its factions.

bottom line, if you enjoyed/loved gundam WING than you definatley need to watch this. FYI the relationship between the main character and the princess (later introduced) is another reminder of gundam wing between heero and relena.",1326844800,,1577,4.645161290322581
8341908,3,B001TKK3HU,"As a whole the first part of this gundam trinity was worth the purchase, however this one in particular arrived with a broken dislodged disk from it's holder unlike the other two forcing me to track down another copy from a nearby video story to replace it as it did not work, overall I thank the seller for his services but i had to take points of this one as it was obvious the disk was dislodged when i took it out of the package cause i hear one of the dvd's inside moving.",1306972800,,477,4.085106382978723
8341909,5,B001TKK3HU,"Since everyone already wrote such well thought out detailed reviews I'm gonna keep short, light and simple. Great series. I already saw all of it online. Just buying it because I am and will probably always be a fan of gundam. Just one important thing. Make sure you sit and watch it from beginning to end. The copy I bought has numerous defects and problems. I had one disk which was labeled as part 1 but was actually part 2. So I had two of the same disk with different labels. I actually had bought all three season 1 sets as well as the first set of season 2. I had to contact customer care at bandai for replacement of the first 3 disk. I hope Bandai can cut this nonsense of releasing messed up disk so often. Seems to have happened with previous series as well. Aside for that minor problem, the series is great. Any gundam fan should love it. Everyone should try it out.",1283212800,,879,4.269461077844311
8341910,4,B001TKK3HU,"I just had all of 00 imported from Japan and it has to have a rock soild foundation to ever gundam show to follow after this one. From a story point of view this would be the first one, and it pretty much answers ever question that I ever had from any other gundam show. First it showed were the so called ""Newtypes"" gentatlicy enahcned humans came from and why the earth hated them so much, all thou gundam seed attempted the same thing gundam 00 did a better job at it. Second there is a constent theam in all gundam shows that war is terrible and should be done away with forever, and the gundams seem to always take on this role. Well in gundam 00 it shows why the gundams always take on this mission and where it came from. Third is shows where the Federation came from and why they are always fighting the genaticly enchanced humans. Fourth it shows how humanity ended up living in space colnies, and why.

Thou gundam 00 had a really great opening it flamed out really fast. The same story got repeated over and over again, it was the same battle reapeated. The cast was to big and I spent most the show trying to figure out who was who, and then they all changed. I must admit I had to rewatch the last 2 eps becsause I fell asleep.

Gundam 00 is a good show and has a good foundation and sets the stage for all gundams but it gets old and the excitment of the show flames out fast.",1273881600,,1390,4.144444444444445
8341911,5,B001TKK3HU,"First let me state that I am a HUGE Gundam fan.  I did not enjoy Gundam Seed Destiny very much (though Gundam Seed was amazing) and have been waiting for Sunrise to make it up to the fans.  The delivered.  I still am sore about Gundam Seed Destiny and a waste of three years waiting for this masterpiece.

There are much lengthier reviews, so I will be short and add my 2 cents.  First, this is the first Gundam series to be set in the AD timeline (everything else has been Cosmic era this or that).  Also, previous series have mostly focused on the far future with bizarre floating worlds and unbelievable weapons and technology.  This is the first series that actually takes place in the near future and with believable advances and technology rooted in scientific theories of today.

The world is dependent on solar power due to the depletion of fossil fuels.  This gives rise to three world factions, each controlling one of three solar power stations in space. There are many countries left out of this new power supply, namely the middle east and other petroleum dependent nations. So, in a way this is a believable future for our current world state of affairs.

The only problem is that Sunrise introduces a LOT of characters in the first few episodes, so the viewer is bombarded with information, backgrounds, and plot threads.  This begins to make sense towards episode 25 or so, but in the meantime, confusion!  But the characters are well made, though often taciturn (especially the Gundam Meisters), so we don't really get to see the characters for what they are initially.

Stick with the series after the first five or so episodes to really get into the heart of the plot.  The first five are pretty boring but make more sense and are more enjoyable on a second viewing.  After about episode five the series really heats up.

So in my opinion:

Pros:  Animation, story, characters, music
Cons: First five episodes tough to get through, especially for those not into Gundam

Please PLEASE watch in Japanese with English subtitles.  If there is one thing Sunrise is great at, it is acquiring top notch Japanese voice acting!",1265673600,9,2137,4.708894878706199
8341912,5,B001TKK3HU,"In Oct. 2007, a new MS Gundam series titled ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00"" debuted on television.  The series is the seventh Mobile Suit Gundam series to air on television and is directed by Seiji Mizushima (""Fullmetal Alchemist, ""Dai-Guard"", ""Slayers Next"" and ""Shaman King"") and a screenplay by Yousuke Kuroda (""Gungrave"", ""Big Windup!"", ""Infinite Ryvius"" and ""Madlax"").  The series is the first Gundam series to be animated in widescreen and in High Definition and overall, a new storyline in the Alternative Universe of Mobile Suit Gundam.

The year is 2307 A.D. and the Earth's reserves of fossil fuels have been depleted.  Humanity has then developed a plan for nearly half a century to capture solar energy through a large tower/solar power regeneration system that extends from the Earth, out to space for a source of energy.  The nations of the world have gathered around three blocks and are known as:

The Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations (The Union) led by the United States, The Human Reform League led by China, Russia and India and the Advanced European Nation (AEU) featuring the European nations.

Each of these groups have continued on their quest of higher power and have become rivals and have showcased their advancements in technology by the creation of man-controlled machines and vehicles in case of war.

But out of nowhere, two Mobile Suit Gundams have come to show their power to these three groups by destroying their top robot weapons.  Immediately, the people of the world receive a message from a paramilitary group known as the Celestial Being that they will eliminate acts of war and conflict from the world.  They have chosen to intervene to rid of humanity from the scourge of war.  If there is an act of war carried out, the Celestial Being will intervene.

But now each group has interest in the power of the Mobile Suit Gundams and each group will do what they can to obtain this new power by any means possible.

The main characters of ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00"" are:

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Mobile Suit Gundam 00' is the first Gundam series to be shot in High Definition and in widescreen.  My first impression of the animation was that for a television series, the artistic backgrounds are quite detailed and are quite vibrant.  Overall, animation was quite solid.  Character designs were provided by Michinori Chiba (""Basilisk"" and ""Slayers Return"") and Yun Kouga (""Genji"", ""Earthian"", ""Genji"" and ""Gestalt"").

While mechanical designs were courtesy of quite a good number of talent such as Hitoshi Fukuchi (""Casshan: Robot Hunter"" and ""Borgman""), Kanetake Ebikawa (""Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid"", ""Blue Submarine No. 6' and ""Burst Angel""), Kenji Teraoka (""El Hazard: The Wanderers"", ""Arc the Lad"", ""Avenger"" and ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion""), Kunio Okawara (""Gravion"", ""Armored Trooper Votoms"" and ""Betterman""), Naohiro Washio (""Heroic Age"" and ""Sokyuu no Fafner""), Seeichi Nakatani (""You're Under Arrest"" and ""S-CRY-ed"") and Takayuki Yanase (""Darker than BLACK"", ""Eureka Seven"" and ""Toward the Terra"").

As for the audio, the series is presented in English 2.0 and Japanese 2.0.  I watched the series with both language tracks and for both English and Japanese, the acting was quite solid and are very similar in character portrayals.  For audio, I chose to listen to both tracks via setting my receiver to Stereo on all channels.  With so much action involved, I wish the audio was presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 but for the most part, for those who have the ""stereo on all channels"" setting on their home theater receiver, ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00' definitely sounds much immersive that way.  Otherwise, the series is a front channel driven series and dialogue is clear and understandable.  Also, it was interesting musically to see the series opt for a more rock soundtrack with L'Arc~en~Ciel for the opening theme song and Stephanie for the ending theme song.

As for subtitles, the television series is presented with optional English subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was definitely surprised by the fresh storyline of ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00"".  The whole concept of nations throughout Earth aligning themselves to a major group and instead of finding any unified resolve, humankind continues its ways of contemplating more war.  And of course, the introduction of the Celestial Being to put a stop to those who continue to fight wars is an interesting concept.

Mainly because each group is no different from each other.  Each region with people living their lives normally and are supportive of their government and military protecting them.  None of these regions can be seen as evil but because they develop weapons for war, they are seen as targets by the Celestial Being.

On the other hand, the Celestial Being sees themselves as the answer to stop humanity getting involved in war and that means destroying those weapons.  But by no means is the Celestial Being group looked as heroes, some see them as a bullying military group.

And to make things interesting, the Gundam Meisters, especially pilot Setsuna F. Seiei is different from previous Gundam pilot protagonist.  This is a young man who murdered his own parents in cold blood and nearly each of these Gundam Meisters dislike each other or have some sort of instability that makes them quite different from past Gundam pilots that may have seemed like heroes.

It's interesting because in many ways, every Gundam series, we have looked at the Mobile Suit as a symbol of hope and justice.  Protecting the innocent and although the Celestial Beings are trying to protect humanity from war, in some ways, it seems as if its working against them and instead of the viewer rooting for a side, what we end up getting are groups who are fighting for their people, to protect their people and each group seems to have their own protagonist that the story shows off its complexity.  Although the Gundams belong to the Celestial Beings, they are seen as terrorists for their attacks all over the world (in order to prevent war) and the world seeing the casualties of innocents.

The first nine episodes appears to focus more on the plight of the various nations plotting to capture the Gundam and pretty much showcasing the state of the world and humanity which reinforces why the Celestial Being stepped in and took matters into their own hands.  Storyline-wise, the series is much more mature and complex and with so many characters involved, one may wish there were episodes geared to more character development style of storylines but the series starts out with fighting and each and every episode, the action is non-stop.

So, far there is plenty of mecha action and battles galore.  One will find the amount of visual effects and smooth battles to be awesome, especially for televised animation.  Fighting is smooth, well-planned attack sequences are also well-done.  But what makes the series quite intriguing and enjoyable is its storyline.  It's quite different from past Gundam series (there are a few similarities to ""Gundam Wing"" and even ""Super Robot Wars OG"") and its the first series in which the Gundam and its pilots are considered as terrorists and we see the world's reaction to that.  It's definitely different, much more complex and so far, a captivating series.

""Mobile Suit Gundam 00"" is complex, intriguing, action-packed and highly enjoyable.  I definitely recommend this anime series!",1251244800,25,14711,4.944740073679902
8341913,4,B001TKK3HU,"Never cared for anime, knew nothing about Gundam then all of a sudden I catch an episode of this on SciFi and I am surprisingly hooked. Takes me back to the days of watching Robotech as a kid. The storyline is addictive, the characters are likeable, the voice work is top notch, and if you know nothing about the Gundam mythos it doesn't matter. I think this series works fine as a standalone. Would give this 5 stars but I am pissed they kept pushing back the release date on this and are prolonging the 2nd part by almost another 2 months. 2nd season is already on SciFi. There's also only 9 episodes on this, should be at least 12 if its the first part of 2.",1248825600,11,661,4.21259842519685
