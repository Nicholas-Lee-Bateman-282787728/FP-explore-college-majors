Of course some information is interesting and will remain relatively timeless, however on a whole, a significant amount of it has little to do with motion picture technology directly. The second disk of this set is mostly film shorts from an industrial film producer who was likely lampooning previous clients and the associated problems in the production process. They were probably created for presentation at some internal or industry function. Thanks for reminding me of what it was like to work in a Dilbert cartoon!

The producers have added nothing to the material other than an apparent template dvd menu with two chapters of self promotional materials.

The menu and films of first disk from this set, was the same as the second disk in the copy of Volume I from this series that I also purchased. I had emailed the producers of this product to see if there was anything that they could do. Of course I never heard back from them.

You may want to visit the motion picture section of the Internet Archive - [...] - for some of - if not ALL of - the actual material found on these disks, so you can download the material you want and save your money.

Although I see that the creators of this set offers similar titles, I'm willing to bet that they are just more downloads from [...] hastily placed on a DVD.

The producers should really be ashamed for the misleading title, careless project direction and poor quality control.",1243382400,,1592,4.591549295774648
8186068,5,B000A26M5K,"This was a fascinating dvd set to watch. It takes you back to the beginging of motion picture technology in the 19th century and shows you how visionaries like the Lumiere Brothers managed to create screen visuals more than a 100 years before the advent of computer generated graphics. Of course, the films are nowhere near as advanced as modern pictures, but its still intersesting to see how filmakers originally figured out how to create the effects they wanted and the drama that their audience demanded. It's very comprehensive and everything makes sense.",1152835200,,560,5.032258064516129
