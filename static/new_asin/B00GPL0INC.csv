8626103,4,B00GPL0INC,"The anime in question is a pretty good mix of fan service, comedy, and action. I can't come up with any issues l, but I was expecting a little more",1481587200,,147,3.933333333333333
8626104,1,B00GPL0INC,"If you already have the original release, skip this. There is no difference, this is not dubbed as it says on the site here. Returned",1446595200,2,133,4.36
8626105,1,B00GPL0INC,"This Said that it is Dubbed in English, but the defention of english dub in regarding to english dubbed ANIME is.

(n)/(v). A type of Japanese anime that has its original Japanese voices removed and replaced by English voiceovers by English voice actors. This is different from subbed anime, which has english subtitles while still preserving the unchanged and more natural Japanese voices of the original anime.
I like the story but I was wanting to hear it in my own language saying that this is in English Dub is bull. Tell the truth or don't sayanything!",1446595200,2,558,4.752577319587629
8626106,3,B00GPL0INC,"This has engaging characters and a satisfying story of selfless love, difficult decisions, sticking to your principals and finding common ground to solve a large issue.  Mixed in are fun experiences filled with friendship and teamwork.
The setting and character visual style is consistent and well done.
What makes it loose two stars for me is what I consider unnecessary sexually themed still images halfway through each episode and the nude bath scenes which are also inconsistent with the characters and story.
If those elements are offensive to you as well Id say don't purchase this one.
I ended up dropping mine in the trash but would be interested in a version that did not have the unnecessary elements.",1418860800,,711,4.974789915966387
8626107,1,B00GPL0INC,this anime is so boring it not worth the moeny it coast to buy it. i try to give it a shot but i couldn't get past how bloody boirng it was this is one of thoes anime that make you want to go outside an look at buch of ants walking by on the ground that would be better then this show .-.,1400112000,2,288,3.515625
8626108,5,B00GPL0INC,"The first episode may seem like this is another harem anime (in a way it still is) however by the end of the episode leading into the next one the plot kicks in with one heck of a surprise for the main characters, this anime does carry itself well with a good plot, nice sorcery play as magic is involved, and each character brings their own unique personality with them.

I would definitely recommend this if you are into magic anime's and enjoy unique character humor.",1394150400,2,470,4.465116279069767
