4455450,5,B004QSQMHW,This is a comprehensive historical account of aliens throughout the ages. Not what I was expecting but highly informative nonetheless. Completely different approach than most programs on this subject. I was impressed.,1368835200,2,217,5.8125
4455451,3,B004QSQMHW,"This is 2 DVDs of Jason Martell lecturing on the subject of previous visitations of extraterrestrials to the Sumerians and other cultures.  I'm still skeptical, though the evidence can be fascinating and sometimes compelling.  The basic premises seem a little prejudiced: that ancient people weren't that bright without their ET benefactors, and that ancient people didn't know the difference between extraterrestrials and gods.  This translation of mythic tales into literal reality seems like a product of our own non-religious age, rather than reality.  In other words, it's misleading for us to judge ""ancient man"" by our own lights.  Throw in the idea that ""there just isn't enough time for evolution to work the way it's supposed to,"" and you have the genesis (get it) of a theory that life came from outer space, ready to go.  I like it, but is it true?  And why the big secret if it is?",1339286400,,894,4.880794701986755
4455452,4,B004QSQMHW,"This is an interesting program because it puts ""aliens"" in a cultural and historical context, as opposed to a strictly scientific one. It was unique to shift perspective and to learn about the way past civilizations viewed unusual occurrences, as well.",1338854400,2,252,5.170731707317073
4455453,1,B004QSQMHW,"If you are thinking of buying this DVD, don't.  It is a very amateur video of a stage speech, unedited for DVD.  The speakers seem unprepared, visuals are childlike overhead projections, sound quality is very bad, often fading.  Some of the information is interesting but nothing that someone who is truly interested in this subject does not already know.  There are much more worthy DVD's on offer - such as the Ancient Alien Series 1, 2 & 3",1331769600,4,442,4.628205128205129
4455454,3,B004QSQMHW,"I wanted this DVD set for reasons that will strike many as unusual. I am in no way a sucker for Ancient Astronaut Theory. There is a major problem with it from the starting gate. What I am interested in, and this series does a uniquely good job of it, are the historical artifacts and criticism of how academia arrogantly and tunnel vision explains things away. I have a strong influence in my grand children's education and development. I showed the series to them as an important part of their education. I also showed them the documentary on Coral Castle in Florida and I recommend this to everyone, Robert Bauvel's ""Egypt Exposed"" DVD. I have taught them about the large, important events and streams of American History that university American Historians skip over, such as working class history (Labor Historians are really Labor Union & activity of American socialists Historians). They also make wild generalizations about indentured and bonded servants and pre-1900s rural workers to prop up what are really political statements about Slavery. (Ever heard of divide and conquer politics?

US politicians seem to thrive on it and US historians seem to provide the backup literature for them. David A Hollinger appears to be running a lone ranger fight against academics who fan the flames of race politics. Someday, the different US ethnic groups are going to realize they have a lot more in common with each other than the clowns in government. When it happens, the power elites will tremble in their shoes) They ignore an important segment of US institutional history, local poor houses, mens homes, children homes and orphanages, a history Americans can be proud of. Were it not for Diane Ravitch's excellent work on public school history, there would be no US education history writing that makes any sense (i.e., has any relationship to reality as we know it)

Season I and II of Ancient Aliens is an excellent way to ""see"" and ""explore"" artifacts and sites important for a rounded understanding of the origins and global ancient history of humankind. The academics not only write for each other and for grant money and career ladder climbing, they are arrogant. If you want to fully see what I mean, read the introduction and a chapter or two of Will Durant's pioneer, admirable
attempt to write a history of civilization. He devoted 45 years of full time attention to his 11 volume ""The Story of Civilization"". Volume I is properly ""Our Oriental Heritage"", published in 1935. The idea for Total history did not originate with left wing, Freudian French intelligentsia. It began before that with non-academic, master prose stylist, Will Durant. Like a good solid start toward a real higher education? Forget college. Read the 11 volumes of Durant's ""...Civilization"". Its all there. Basic education in architecture, sciences, art, languages. And Durant writes well and he is writes with great wit. Our university system is as corrupt as our Federal Government. Read a little of Durant and you will see scholarship written the way it should be. Durant is always informing readers of researcher controversies and what we do not know for sure. What we cannot know. Ever read an academic work that isn't written in a voice of God tone?

Granted Ancient Alien Theory is wild, but leaders in the field such as Cremo, Hancock, and the moderator of this series are careful researchers. Their facts and criticisms of mainstream are mostly right on target. Good knowledge does not always come in neat little complete packages. Cremo's extensive review and criticism of mainstream archeology and related disciplines is unique and one of a kind. His ""Forbidden Archeology"" is in important ways a masterpiece. Many graduate archeology professors outside America use it now as text book for Archeology students learning archeology methods and for comprehensive look at mainstream material evidence and mainstream rejected evidence. They just tell them to skip over the alternative theory part.

I strongly recommended this well done documentary. The camera crew ""takes you"" to places you should have but have not heard of and explains it too you and gives you a good idea of what mainstream thinks of it. The moderator who is an Ancient Aliens guy, does a great job. He doesn't try to cram the theory down your throat and he consistently presents it as a highly controversial theory. I do not see where he resorts to any fact bending or spin to try to win minds over to Ancient Aliens. He gives you enough to allow you to decide, something the academics do not like to do. The are quite doctrinaire. In their own way, as doctrinaire as the scholastic academics of the Middle Ages, they are always using as foils in their crusade for your mind.

About the Ancient Alien Theory. It has a big problem out the gate. First, they cite academics for assuming ancient people were inferior to us, that they were stupid. Then, they turn around and assume a stupidity of their own. Everywhere god or gods are mentioned they want you to believe that the ancients were so irrational and simple that they took merely advanced people from off planet for supernatural Gods. Globally, people mistook aliens for gods. The central evidence for this really boils down to a primitive island tribe that  supposedly reacted to a temporary US Air Force Presence as cargo gods and formed a religion around them after they left. To assume this is what happened is to assume correct what a few academics wrote about the Cargo Cult. Even for this backward tribe there are other possibilities. The cult of Alien visitors skips over the academic literature questioning several interpretations of the culture of such tribal people. Basically, what the critics present is evidence that often field researchers underestimate the intelligence, analytical capacity, and rationality of 'primitive"" people they study. Its found that often the study subjects play games with and for the researchers. Like convicted child molesters, they figure out what the researchers want and they cater to that in order to get what they want. Their other ""evidence"" is the reported American reaction to the Spanish conquesadors. Alledgely, they just let a handful of spanish, far from home, kill them because they thought they were th returned white gods of their religion. We are talking about an empire and by accepting that potentially weak explanation we assume that unlike all other empires, this one was monolithic. All the people were the same. They thought the same. They believed the same. The rulers managed to rule and empire but they were still so stupid and so irrational that they stood by dumb founded as a few Spanish off a big boat killed them off. I think what the cult of Alien Visitors should do is question mainstream about its conclusions pertaining to how the Spanish managed to so easily conquer an entire powerful empire.

This brings us to the Alien Visitor Cult's own use of evidence. While they provide powerful presentation of mysteries that challenge mainstream theories and they legitimately reject how mainstream handles these mysteries, Alien Visitor Cult does an even poorer job of how they treat the evidence. You may want to pause a moment from their smooth prose and ask ""what are they smoking"". They work evidence like many American Professors of literature work serious literature. Anything goes for what the great writer was really saying so long as the professor seems to sew the writing together well into his interpretation. Somehow, the attitude goes, the great writer who wrote great literature or poetry was too stupid to realize what he was doing. Huh? Arrogant? You betcha.

This Ancient Alien theory reads more like the work of a pagan religious cult, trying to use history to ""prove"" the truth of their theology. Nothing new about that, right. I think with investigation you will find these people are influenced by the writings of (possibly) charlatan Professor of mythology, the late Joseph Campbell and some of them maybe inspired by the late great capitalist of a science-fiction story religion, L.R. Hubbard. He was a pulp science fiction writer who was paid by the word. He started telling friends a man could starve writing science fiction stories and we have a letter in which he wrote that to a friend and added that if a man could invent a new religion instead he would be rich.
A short time later Hubbard published ""Dianetics"" and with it launched his Church of Scientology. He later sold it for a reported 800 million dollars. Final note. The guru for these Ancient Alien guys is Erich von Daniken, author of runaway international best seller, ""Chariots of the Gods. Daniken was a professional embezzler and con man before ""Chariots..."" and after it made him a lot of money, he was convicted again of embezzlement. That and the fact that the main UFO and ancient alien writers make a cushy living off their books and public appearances and now from scripted so-called reality TV shows and big documentaries. Worth considering before you float too far off planet.",1314835200,2,9073,4.948818897637795
4455455,1,B004QSQMHW,"I admire his courage to get up and present his views, especially considering his fractured use of English.  The ancient astronauts ""departed"" information to man and volcanos ""emanate gas and lava.""  I found I couldn't even watch the entire program due to all the missued words.  I knew what he meant, but really, how can I have any faith in what he is saying when he can't even pick the correct words to say it?  Beside this glaring problem, he essentially re-hashes the work of others, poorly, without adding anything new of his own research.  It is like a very bad book report on other authors.  Everything is ""interestingly enough"" and ""will be discussed in detail later"" (later never arrives). Is he paying these other authors for re-presenting their work?  He really should because he adds nothing new of his own at all.  If you are looking for an outline of all the information on this topic, you will get an attempt at that here, if you can stand to watch it.",1314576000,3,966,4.575581395348837
4455456,3,B004QSQMHW,I found this film very educational. The history of the so called Ancient Astronauts was very entertaining and educational. I recommend this DVD to anyone who has questions on the Extra terrestrial and how they evolved in our world.,1307059200,2,231,4.948717948717949

4455471,5,B004QSQMHW,"One can see why the Christians get their panties all in a wad after viewing this video.  This video places their bible stories where they belong as being stories which were plagiarized, and of course they want to believe the bible stories are all original and exclusive to their holy book.  However, it becomes difficult for them to argue against information that has been written in stone thousands of years before the bible was even thought of becoming yet one-more fairy-tale book..",1460937600,5,485,4.902439024390244

4455476,4,B004QSQMHW,This is a really cool look at Sumeria and how much knowledge came out of that area of the world. Some of that information is seemingly inexplicable and points toward aliens providing it. The earth has been around for such a long time it's not too hard for me to fathom that others visited here previously.

8438533,2,B004QSQMHW,"Poor quality video with little logic to tie all this together. If Niburu orbits a 3600 year cycle and the visitation occurred about 6000 years ago it should have shown up again between 400BC to  400AD in Roman historical times [The Romans left lots of records ]and as it got closer to Earth and was going away from Earth it should stay visible for hundreds of years. There would be historical records of all this. Just to point out one glaring illogical hole in the whole mishmash. Niburu won't be back for another 1200 years in our future but should be easily visible by perturbations on planetary orbits, since its only a third of its orbit away from earth and is speeding up due to its elliptical orbit. He also mentions that the ocean has depth of 25 miles and clearly this easy fact is off by 300%. This guy is not very bright and quite credulous. The stones at Baalbek Lebanon are quite mysterious but this character doesn't have any answers. The horrible quality of this video will send you to an optometrist. Need I say more. Post Script: I looked up the mystery of the Trilithon stones at Baalbek and on wikipedia which has references: Each one of these stones is 70 feet long, 14 feet high, 10 feet thick. Lets do a calculation of the cubic volume of granite for this stone: V = 70x14x10 = 9800 cu ft of granite. Granite weighs about 175 lb/cu ft so the weight = 9800 x 175= 1,714,000 lbs and in tons 1,714,000 / 2000 = 857.5 tons. Now the Romans were quite capable of moving stones of this size and there are many examples of moving stones of 500 tons. So the assertion of them being 1200 tons or even larger is quite wrong and would have only required measuring them. The Romans had pulleys and cranes and levers and could move very large stones and blocks and did that routinely throughout their empire. So there is really no mystery except why the authors don't check into obvious facts and take measurements and calculations. If they did they would not have anything to make a movie about. My calculations can be checked and the information I provide can be checked by using wikipedia or other sources that this review is too short to provide. Check them yourself and free yourself from delusion.",1472083200,,2211,4.486352357320099
