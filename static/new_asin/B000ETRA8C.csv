8114139,1,B000ETRA8C,"Apparently a transfer from an early 1990s videocassette source, this documentary is deadly dull, consisting entirely of the same two or three scholars -- who have a creepy, pseudo-religious vibe -- discoursing about different religions in a ""smarter-than-thou"" pedantic tone. There's really no footage or exploration of different religious beliefs and customs. It really is just a couple of guys talking endlessly in front of the camera about religions. Truly a disappointing video.",1382140800,2,482,5.616438356164384
8114140,5,B000ETRA8C,"I teach 10th grade World History and I find this a very useful video in introducing the world religions. I do not expect the video to do my teaching for me. I introduce the basic ideas in the historical context, and have the kids start  reading  the basic info in the textbook and THEN I show the relevant 10 minutes of the video. What I like is the objective stance of the film, the emphasis on the connection and differences between related religions and how religions change over time. The visuals and the brevity of the segments are a great assistance.
This is a very useful teaching tool! I use it every year.",1353283200,2,614,4.424778761061947
8114141,1,B000ETRA8C,The movie came in a reasonable amount of time and was in good condition.  It was just not what I wanted.  I have been looking for a decent movie on the 6 major belief systems for quite some time and have yet to find one.  This move will not hold the attention of 10th graders.,1236729600,8,276,3.981818181818182
8114142,5,B000ETRA8C,"The above DVD has been released as part of the Pillars of Faith series released by Kultur Video. The series consisting of four parts uses extensive accurate reconstructions, new location footage, contemporary imagery and expert commentary & analysis throughout to provide a comprehensive overview on the featured subject. I am just providing you a summary of all the parts featured in the series :

Part-I  Pillars of Faith: Celtic Saints

Early Christianity took some unusual turns when it reached Ireland. Mostly isolated from the rest of the Christian world, Irish missionaries adapted their teachings to Celtic culture, and the resulting fusion generated uniquely Irish religious art, a monastic experience different from that on the continent, and the preservation of pre-Christian mythology. Pillars of Faith: Celtic Legends details the Irish culture of the time and examines the sweeping effect Christianity had on the people, their culture, and their art. The video traces Irish Christianity back to its earliest historical references.

This DVD uses historical re-enactments and artifacts, as well as discussions by experts to tell the story of the conversion of Ireland to Christianity in the 5th Century. The culture and religion of the pagan Celts are portrayed and discussed to deepen our understanding of the period. The lives of the two major saints of early Ireland, St. Patrick and St. Brigid who effected the conversion are told in detail by dramatic re-enactment. The other major portion of the DVD is devoted to the development of the Irish monasteries.

Part-II  Pillars of Faith: Martyrs to Christianity

This documentary chronicles the story of those who were willing to die for their faith. In the several hundred year period after the crucifixion of Christ, His followers were an unestablished, and often persecuted band of believers. As they set forth to spread their faith, they often met with derision, resistance, and death. Like Paul of the New Testament during Christ's own time, many subsequent disciples of Christianity were imprisoned. Others were executed. All refused to decry the Christ for their own sakes. That tradition has continued down through the centuries. This film looks at some of the faithful, from Thomas More to Catholic priests in the New World. Their stories are testaments to the depth of their convictions.

8114143,2,B000ETRA8C,"This video may be fine for personal use, but our school purchased it with the intent of using it with our 9th graders as part of their social studies curriculum.  With that purpose in mind, I was disappointed upon viewing the tape.  Although the voiceover and regional footage are useful, the many segments featuring the college professors are too esoteric--the vocabulary they use is well beyond any 9th grader's comprehension, and is frustrating for even a teacher to sit through!  What captured my attention in purchasing this video was the overview of each religion and promise of period and region-related imagery.  These are provided; however, I wanted to warn other teachers comtemplating this purchase that, in my opinion, it is a waste of money in terms of a junior high/high school level.",1110153600,8,798,5.0227272727272725
