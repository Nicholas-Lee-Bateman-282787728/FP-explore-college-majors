8638783,3,B00I3PR4TE,"This is a minor film noir effort, with solid but unremarkable performances from a bunch of actors (Barry Sullivan, William Conrad, Richard Basehart) who would all become much better known for their work in television.  Audrey Totter (who also did a lot of TV work, but without gaining notoriety) excelled at playing ""bad girls"",  and plays that role to the hilt in this movie.  She is memorable as a nasty, calculating, but none-too- bright villainess.  Basehart is cast as a Clark Kent / Walter Mitty type who loses his wife to a rich cad, gets sand kicked in his face, and dreams of taking his revenge.  Ridding himself of glasses, and renting an apartment in a different section of town, he befriends a pretty neighbor (a barely recognizable Cyd Charisse, in one of her least glamorous outings).  He is falsely accused of a murder he envisioned but did not commit, and has painted himself into a corner as the perfect suspect.  But his new girlfriend sticks by him, and when his manipulative wife tries to put moves on one of the detectives, her behavior becomes her undoing.

It all adds up to a passable ""B"" movie with some period interest , but little more.",1490572800,,1163,4.666666666666667
8638784,5,B00I3PR4TE,"A first rate film noir where Audrey Totter is as usual type cast as an evil slut is well told and moves inevitably to its happy conclusion.  Richard Basehart is great as always playing a bit of a nerd and devoted husband.  He's a chemist at a drugstore and seems to be the only one who doesn't know his wife is constantly cheating on him.  When he finally finds out and confronts Audry with her latest amour he is punched and humiliated, falling to the floor.  His pride is hurt and he is determined to have revenge.  He moves out of town and changes his name; takes off his eyeglasses and wears contact lenses.  This is supposed to make him unrecognizable!  He meets a sweet neighbor, Cyd Charisse with whom he falls in love.  He returns to kill the bully lover of his wife but finds he can't do it and leaves.  The next day the man is found shot to death and he is held as a suspect.  Audry now finds him interesting and tries to win him back but he refuses and realizes she is the murderer.  Finally she is discovered trying to plant the gun in his apartment and the game is up.  Cyd and Richard walk off to happy-ever-after.  Good show.",1471305600,,1140,4.246511627906977
