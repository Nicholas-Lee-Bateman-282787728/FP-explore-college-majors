1986495,4,B0001BFDK0,"This DVD set is great for what it is. A fairly huge collection of not-so-circulated 1960's Popeye cartoons. Sure, they aren't the Fleischer versions, but its better than all the forever-repeated public domain titles, and way better than nothing at all.

Have fun. And don't leave home without yer spinach!

UPDATE:

After having watched this set a few times I have to say that I am very happy with KOCH's mastering of these episodes to DVD. They look great. Bright, clean, clear, no artifacts, M-M-M-Good! The only issue I have is there is a sudden audio crackle at the beginning of one episode that made me jump becuase it was so loud. Hahaha.

Anyways. Good job to KOCH, now how about some Rocket Robinhood or Mighty Hercules?!? Heheh. I recommend to everyone who is intrested in obscure cartoons to pick up KOCH's other box set; Krazy Kat & Ignatz Mouse, and the upcoming Galaxy Rangers dvds.",1081296000,4,895,4.717948717948718
1986496,3,B0001BFDK0,"Even though this DVD contains the limited animation made-for-TV cartoons from the 1960s, one can still find some entertaining and/or interesting films on it.  Some use Segar's cast and/or are based on Segar stories (ex. Wimpy The Moocher, From Rags To Riches To Rags, Me Quest For Poopdeck Pappy).  Some are Sagendorf-like (ex. Insultin' The Sultan).  Some are pretty clever (ex. Egypt Us, Golden-Type Fleece).  Some flirt briefly with the sort of romantic storylines that Famous Studios used to do (ex. Motor Knocks, My Fair Olive).  Some would be exciting to young children (ex. Gem Jam, Giddy Gold).  Some have interesting character designs (ex. Bulter Up, Coffee House, Barbecue For Two, Sea No Evil). BUT some of these cartoons are among the worst ever created (ex. Popeye And The Giant, Old Salt Tale)!!  And most of the people who visit my Popeye fansite are asking for the Fleischer and the Famous Studios cartoons to be released.  This ain't them!  Still, it's a start.

1986499,4,B0001BFDK0,"I think this set has been unfairly maligned.  Many of the critical reviews here complain that the cartoons aren't as good as the black & white Fleischer Studios' Popeye shorts.  And while that is certainly true, it doesn't mean that these cartoons are bad.

Many of them feature outrageous situations which set them apart from the more grounded approach taken in the earlier cartoons.  But any Popeye fan worth his (sea) salt will recognize that Segar's original comic strips often featured his characters in situations which stretch credibility beyond the breaking point.

These cartoons from 1960-61 are colorful, quick and fun.  I was highly entertained throughout all 85 (!) shorts.  And I don't know why some reviewers are claiming the 'toons aren't remastered; they look fantastic.  The set is also a great deal for the price.",1232236800,5,832,5.0661764705882355
1986500,3,B0001BFDK0,"Animation connoisseurs love to beat up these early 60s made-for-TV Popeye cartoons as predictably, though perhaps with less cause, than Popeye himself loves to beat up anyone messing around with his sweetie Olive Oyl. It's true that the post-UPA graphic styles and limited animation do not really suit an action-oriented series (often, when Popeye threw punches, only his arm moved). Still, considering the bargain-basement budgets given these cartoons and the lightning deadlines the artists had to work under, it's a bit surprising that the cartoons are as good as they are. And speaking of the artists: some of the best animators in the field at the time had hands in the production. Producer-Director Jack Kinney assembled a team of Disney and UPA veterans who a year before were working on ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the Magoo feature ""1001 Arabian Nights"" (which Kinney directed). Other studios, in New York, Los Angeles, and Europe (under Gene Dietch, at the time considered the great white hope of contemporary animation, who also was producing the Tom and Jerry series), made a number of the cartoons; the diverse styles give these cartoons as a collection added interest. Not surprisingly, the slickest of these Popeyes came from the Fleischer/Famous Studio artists who had produced the theatrical shorts for 25 years. The actual saving grace of these cartoons is the wide range of storylines--unlike the better animated but rigidly formulaic theatrical Popeyes--and the use of so many of the Thimble Theatre characters sadly ignored by Fleischer and Famous (or underused, as in the case of Wimpy and the Jeep). Best of all, Jack Mercer, Mae Questel, and Jackson Beck were back on hand to lend their incomparable vocal talents. In sum, these are cheap cartoons cheaply prices, and worthy of a look-in (or a re-look-in). Many Boomers grew up on these cartoons; I bet Don Draper's (of TV's ""Mad Men"") kids watched them!",1226361600,2,1922,5.104761904761904
1986501,4,B0001BFDK0,"Popeye the spinach-eating Sailor returned to the public eye on the small screen back in fall 1960 after 25 calendar years on the big screen(1933 to '57). Paramount studios,who produced the theatrical cartoons,participated in some of the 220-short project that ended in spring 1961. Okay,here is the 75th anniversary collection(Popeye debuted in newspaper comicstrips in 1929) of many,but not all,of the King Features Syndicate TV shorts. HITS AND MISSILES was the first broadcast TV short produced by Paramount. HAM features Popeye,dressed in a white suit and black tie,his slender girlfriend Olive Oyl,dressed in a short sleeve shirt and skirt like she wore during the Famous Studios(color) era(1943 to '57) and their hamburger-eating friend J. Wellington Wimpy visiting outer space. There are more Paramount-produced shorts in this collection like MY FAIR OLIVE,OIL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,BUTLER UP,GIDDY GOLD and SEE-RING IS BELIEVE-RING. BARBECUE FOR TWO like HAM,opens with the same theme music as heard in the 1950's shorts. BFT,the first produced by Jack Kinney Studios,features Popeye and Olive dressed in their comicstrip and Fleischer Studios(1933 to '43) clothes(Olive wore a cardigan sweater). Remember Bluto? He is now Brutus and still he's an often-rival of Popeye's. BFT features Popeye preparing for a private barbecue for himself and Olive and the aroma of the grilling burgers attracts Wimpy's attention. Brutus shows up as well and so does Swee Pea. Other cartoons in this collection were produced by Larry Harmon Studios,TV Spots,Gene Deitch Studios and Rembrandt. The Kinney-produced shorts were the best because only those feature the complete original theme(the ones by the other studios had edited themes). Like in the Famous era,Jack Mercer(Popeye),Mae Questel(Olive) and Jackson Beck(Brutus) again lend their voice talents to these shorts. Questel worked for Fleischer Studios back in the 30's,first voicing another Paramount star,Betty Boop,before doubling her workload with Olive Oyl. Questel also voiced the Sea Hag,who is seen in this collection(she was never created for the theatrical shorts),also Olive's young niece Geezil. My experiences with these cartoons:I've seen them aired by New York-based WNEW-TV(now WNYW) Channel 5 in my native New Jersey back in the 70's. They were later aired by Philadelphia-based WTAF(now WTXF) Channel 29 and Atlanta's TBS Superstation. King Features Syndicate also produced Beetle Bailey,another comicstrip favorite created by Mort Walker,Snuffy Smith and Barney Google also Krazy Kat.",1205280000,4,2552,5.683246073298429

After watching the first episode I realized these were the inferior Popeye cartoons.  I thought I was getting the ones from the fifties.  These are so poor I skipped through the entire set to see if there were some gems hidden among the garbage.  No such luck.

A true Popeye fan knows that the only ones worth collecting are the Fleischers and the Famous Studios.  I hope someday those will become available.  Until then, this set will sit on my shelf never to be played again.",1178496000,,604,4.283185840707965
1986505,2,B0001BFDK0,"It's impossible to judge the King Features Popeye cartoons objectively -- if you're a Boomer youth.  They weren't meant for a half-hour and out; they were intended for liberal sprinkling into the kiddie shows once the core of local television, now as vanished as kinescopes. I can still see WFIL-TV's sainted Sally Starr, in full Western regalia, smiling her way into these cartoons; I can likewise see the lummox of the great Roger Miller's ""Kansas City Star"" (""That's what I are!"") turning down a ""better job at higher wages"" so he can still run his Popeyes.  Cartoons were cheap programming filler, and by 1960 they were really cheap with the full-bore advent of limited animation.  In an age of bad cartooning these KFS's were among the worst.  Their defects are so widely known we needn't hash over them further except to say they embody different kinds of bad, from the cheesiness of Larry Harmon's (just a little work and they could have had a spinach-eating clown named Bozo) to Gene Deitch's, hyperactive and static at the same time, to Seymour Kneitel's, embodying the cloying goody-goodyness of Paramounts from the time Casper ghosted in.  Only Ken Lowman with his highly agreeable cartoon chamber music in the very badly animated Jack Kinneys (he worked for Disney?) captures the spirit of Popeye and the Elzie Segar strip he came from.  Yet we Boomers can overlook the badness and allow thoughts of childhood yore to sink in.  For this strange charm, and the haze of youthful nostalgia this junk somehow inspires, and even an occasional unearned laugh, I've added a star to my rating.  (It deserves one star for the transfers from old video sources, and for the tracks being inaccessible through the Windows Search menu.)

A word on the packaging: at best Koch played it -- cute. Its ""75th-anniversary"" gag obviously got some Popeye fans, sick unto death of all the PD anthologies, thinking this was the real thing.  Yet the ""trailer"" on Koch Vision's site was a dead giveaway; it has nothing but KFS.  Apparently Koch or King Features must have gotten complaints (or returns) as a year later the packaging was revised with the heading ""85 Full-Color Favorites! 1960-1961"" -- an improvement, but not improvement enough; certainly there was no improving those woebegone cartoons.  At least this set isn't PD, Zack Davisson and the picture quality notwithstanding.  (It bears a Hearst logo and copyright.)  Deceptive marketing aside, it must have had success enough to spur Hearst into agreeing with Time Warner to FINALLY release authorized videos of the Popeye theatricals -- in chronological order, starting with the Fleischers, and from the original negatives.  Bad though this set is, it may yet have served a salutary purpose.

P. S.  Your best bet buying this (if you really want it) is from the remainder bins of Daedalus, or Berkshire Record Outlet.  This might seem strange -- both retailers specialize in classical-music cutouts -- but Koch got its start in indie classics.

P. P. S.  Please see my comment below for a better explanation of the genius of KFS's Popeyes.",1151884800,,3091,4.953488372093023

1986508,5,B0001BFDK0,"Another classic cartoon that's still fun to watch. After seeing the so called cartoons of today. I'm sure glad I grew up watching great cartoons like ""The Wacky Races"", ""Beetle Bailey"" and my favorite ""Popeye"". This DVD collection showcases the better Popeye cartoons by far. Popeye was alot more humorous. Changing the sometimes mumbling Bluto to Brutis and adding more characters like Whimpy, Alice the Goon, The Seahag and Eugene the Jeep. These cartoons had no boundries for Popeye's many talents. Besides being a sailorman. He was a jack of all trades from a plumber to a fireman you name it Popeye could do it. And with his trademark the ever popular cans of spinach. He could face anything. My (3 Year old) great nephew loves watching the one eyed, corncob pipe smoking, spinach munching sailorman and his pals one episode after another. Other recommended classics now availible on DVD are Bugs Bunny and Friends, The Wacky Races, Yogi Bear, The Flintstones, Top Cat and Garfield and Friends.",1137715200,8,999,4.9523809523809526

But no, this ""Collector's Edition"" is comprised of 86 of the lame King Features Syndicate knockoffs from 1960-61.

Popeye cartoons that were to come with the advent of television (and the corresponding notion that cartoons are only for kids and only for Saturday mornings). They are completely lacking the energy, imagination and eccentricity that made the early black and white cartoons so entertaining. Like the early Betty Boop cartoons of the same time period (though not quite so surreal), there seems to be a hidden beat that runs the length of each film: the characters, objects and backrounds are never actually static. You can actually run just about any pop music instead of the soundtrack and the films just about dance. I must admit that I also find Popeye's constant mumblings much more charming in these early toons: although he is much less intelligible, he is funnier and his whole nature seems more improvised rather than scripted. I wish some studio would shell out the bucks and buy the early stuff and remaster it. I have about 4 hours of these films on a bootleg VHS and they are AMAZING. Popeye deserves the treatment that Republic gave Betty Boop a few years back (although sadly, this same BB collection has yet to come out on DVD).",1099094400,10,1203,4.788461538461538

I am TIRED of the B&W Fleischer toons that are funny and amusing ONLY if you're elderly, the first time I saw a Fleischer toon was in the late 80's on VHS (Lil sweetpea) and since then never liked them.

Sure, I love the great animation in the earlier cartoons but these cartoons are just as funny and the voices are good.

Strange... now that the VCI collection (Popeye:75th Anniversary
Popeye the Sailor Man) is out, you can say the same darn thing about that release! It's incredibly misleading because many people might expect it the be a ""retrospective of Popeye cartoons from the beginning""... including the King Features of the early sixties, right? RIGHT??
But no, since the new VCI 75th Anniversary collection features a batch of Fleischer cartoons none of the cartoon geeks will bother to snub that collection for the same reason.
I say again to interested parties... buy this collection (and the VCI collection too) and have a great time watching them with your kids, and don't pay a bit of attention to the naysayers.
They have forgotten what it is like to be 5 years old and be captivated by cartoons whether the animation is top shelf or second rate. Second rate animation can be thoroughly enjoyed by kids... it's not until you reach adulthood that you might give a hoot about the difference. And even if you do give a hoot, it is just plain silly to suggest that kids would not have a great time watching these cartoons because of the lesser quality animation.

On the other hand, VCI Entertainment has just released an alternate ""75th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" 2-disc set of POPEYE THE SAILOR MAN classic cartoons, and it's worth having. That set contains 9 Fleischer brothers shorts, including the three Technicolor 2-reelers created by Max and Dave Fleischer in the later 1930s, POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS SINDBAD THE SAILOR, POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS ALI BABA's FORTY THIEVES, and ALADDIN AND HIS WONDERFUL LAMP. These are three of the grandest, most colorful, and most imaginative cartoons of the golden era, and they've been restored and color-corrected and look - while not perfect - at least better than they have in a long while. And certainly tens of kazillions of light years better than anything on THIS set.

While not nearly as clever, creative, or beautifully animated as his classic black & white Fleisher theatrical shorts (or the Famous/Paramount era stuff), it's still vastly superior to what Hanna-Barbera reduced the brand to later on. A half dozen studios (including those headed by Gene Dietch and Larry Harmon) cranked these simple made-for-TV toons out like so much spinach sausage, but two factors made 'em worth watching. First, old voice pros Jack Mercer, Mae Questel, and Jackson Beck were still on deck to portray Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Brutus (aka Bluto). Second, never before used Popeye comic strip characters like Sea Hag, Rough House, and King Blozo made multiple appearances...Wimpy, Swee' Pea, and Eugene the Jeep, who had been all but abandoned since the Fleisher flicks, also made welcome returns. Popeye made more cartoons with more companies than any character in history, reason enough to celebrate his muscular legacy. These eighty-five episodes fall squarely between the undisputed brilliance of his Fleisher hey day and the best forgotten Hanna-Barbera atrocity Popeye & Son.

8009796,5,B0001BFDK0,"Edit:

After having read some reviews on here I will say I agree with those who are misled by the title.  It does imply a kind of celebratory 'best of' for the occasion.  And for the life of me I can't figure out why the Popeyes of the late 40's and 50's aren't available but that's another matter.  I knew what they were going in and specifically tracked these cartoons down.  However, that aside,... for those who have nay-sayed and poo pooed this collection for what they are just don't see the big picture.  Yes! are these cartoons wildly inconsistent?  Are there 5 or 6 different house styles of art, direction, music and characterization that could drive a sane person or mildly, slightly obsessive compulsive person, who's a stickler for detail and consistency, into seizures?  (including a distinct Larry Harmon- Bozo-set of cartoons that obviously used his cartoon production company that always kind of took me out of the moment,.....to 4 or 5 others).  Yes there was. Did I realize this as a kid and love them anyway?  The answer again, is yes, I did!

There are so many gems that fit into our afternoon roster of cartoons (along with reruns of Batman - but that's a whole other topic)  They entertained us and became part of our afternoon routine in the summer right after swimming.  There's Popeye trying to fit in with Olive Oyl and her new infatuation with beatnicks in the episode ""CoffeHouse"". (Evidently aside from wearing beat clothes and hair style, all you have to do to be a hip beat nick is to say the word ""cool"" over and over)  And check out Brutus' beat poem 'Ode to an Onion'.  Hilarious!  There's the origin of Eugene the Jeep where Brutus is so mean he is a thistle farmer.  ""Jeeps is is pests, that's why I grows thistles"".  C'mon!  That's funny stuff!  And the episodes with creepy Alice The Goon.

As a kid you sensed that these were a little more low budget and this kind of made them all the more endearing.  Even the music done by Ken Lowman (who deserves his own dedication page on the internet -- hmm, I may do that since no one else is) is great!  Lowman does fun little ditties that stay in your brain with a barebones studio of musicians.  One person to a part and it seems to be only 8 or 9 in the group.  1 trumpet, 1 clarinet, a flute, a harp, a tuba, a bassoon (I believe Lowman was a bassoonist as I found a book of bassoon etudes he wrote also) and a couple of guys doing percussion.  Again, makes it fun and endearing.  I used to write out some of this music for a rodeo band I played in.  We played it for the riders as they came out of the chute. I can just imagine the cowboys and patrons of those rodeos wondering what in the world we were playing.  ""Is that Popeye music?!""

And then you have Jack Mercer as Popeye (whom I believe wrote all these episodes too), Jackson Beck as Brutus, and Mae Questel as Olive Oyl.  They all do many other voices and give very entertaining performances in a more limited work environment.  I mean, it was TV and was the first time Popeye was produced specifically for TV.  Something people need to consider is all the other great Popeye cartoons of old were cinematic cartoons done with big movie studio budgets and only rediscovered on TV.  The powers that be realized there was still a big audience for Popeye.  Mercer was approached, given an assignment and delivered big for the studio, in my opinion.  We were lucky to get these if you look at it like that.  Beck is quoted in a book on Jack Mercer saying that they all banged out their voice work on these cartoons very quickly and under budge,...much to the studios surprise and delight.  The team was in place, they'd all done it before.  Knew their roles.  They were pros at this by then.  Just lack of direction or vision at the top.  They could have done much more.  Shame.

So in conclusion,.....yes, not as slick or consistent as prior Popeye endeavors.  It was TV and they were working cheaper and under tighter time constraints.  But man they are fun for those reasons alone. Even that bad stuff is fun.  More people need to discover these.  And I still say there needs to be some analysis and attention on these somewhere on the web.  Again,...maybe I'll take that up.",1402963200,2,4220,4.439374185136897

8009799,5,B0001BFDK0,"For many Gen-Xers, their first encounter with Popeye was these kooky King Features color shorts from the early 60s. You know--the ones where Popeye was sort of reimagined as a suburban everyman instead of a sailor? When these shorts would pop up in the local TV cartoon-rerun jukebox (in between Tom & Jerry, Roger Ramjet or Looney Toons) a cheer would literally erupt from the kids in the audience. The animation may be limited, the plots silly, but for the right audience this stuff is GOLD.  You get three discs (all single sided) with 80+ cartoons total, each with opening and closing titles intact (remember the feather-pen writing out ""The End"" at the end of each short?) The DVD menu lists each short by name along with a screen cap of each short's title card.

On a whole they are pretty terrible. Animation worse than Hanna Barbara and Jay Ward's cartoons of the same era but lacking all of the wit and creativity that made the limited animation work in those cases. The only cartoon in this set I can honestly say I liked is the one where Popeye finds Poopdeck Pappy (and that's largely because I'm a big fan of that character).

If you're a Popeye fan they are worth watching once, but I can't see myself as eager to do so again (as a matter of fact, I've already resold this item!). Of course, if your were a kid when these came out and have major nostalgia for these you might disagree - then again, if you haven't seen 'em in decades maybe it's better just to keep your old memories of them and stick to Warner's wonderful collections of the original, black and white theatrical cartoons.",1313625600,,1043,4.427083333333333
