8040113,5,B000682JLE,"I took an older VHS tape of this film & had it converted over to a DVD format. The problem in doing this, however, is that you end up with a less-than-crystal-clear picture. But, it's good enough for viewing, although I really wish someone would release this movie in a nice, widescreen DVD version. The movie is based on the book written by Kari's mother who, in turn, wrote the book as a rebuttal against Sheriff Johnny France's book (""Incident at Big Sky""), who botched so much of his investigation of the kidnapping. So much so that he lost the bid for re-election on what would've been his next term in office. Overall, the movie follows the mother's book (""Victims - The Kari Swenson Story"") fairly well, with some minor deviations done for film ""continuity"". Joe Don Baker was superb in his role as the neighboring Sheriff willing to ""go the extra mile"" when Sheriff France kept botching things up. Probably one of the best films out there dealing with this subject.",1416355200,4,973,4.662790697674419
