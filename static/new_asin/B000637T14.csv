2163678,4,B000637T14,"Most of my comment concerns the musical accompaniment for the ""Golden Age of Silent Films"" presentation of the 1920 film, POLLYANNA, with Mary Pickford.

This is a 1970s-era untinted rerelease with a new musical score by eminent theatre-organist Gaylord Carter.  In fact, the tape begins with a 1972 color sequence of Mr. Carter, himself, sitting at the organ.  (I believe he was hired by the Pickford estate to provide music for all the films they were to rerelease.)  His performance for POLLYANNA, although somewhat lacking in variety of approach, is a lighthearted one which enhances the film.  Unlike the music tracks on some other silent prints from around the same time, this one is clean and well-projected.  A great many sound effects (for instance, human voices, various animal sounds, rainfall) have been added as well.

The Carter organ score for POLLYANNA is the only one in the ""Golden Age"" series of seven films for which the musical performer is identified.  Amazingly, there's no identification even in the ""Golden Age of Silent Films"" 6-disc mega-CD collection of scores released concurrently with the videotapes.  I don't get it.  Who goes to the trouble of assembling a mega-disc set and neglects naming the performer(s)?

But to reiterate, POLLYANNA is enjoyable and Mr. Carter's music should not disappoint.",1301356800,2,1329,5.163551401869159
2163679,2,B000637T14,The package promises introductions to each film and chapter selections.  The root menu shows two films and when picked the film starts. NO introduction and no chapter selection. Quality of transfer changes and at times shakes which can be distracting.,1245801600,39,251,5.275
2163680,5,B000637T14,"Hokey premise but a very touching film,its hard to believe Mary Pickford was 27 years old when she made this film. She was totally believable. I was moved by the movie. I know it is well over 80 years old but there was a feel to it that modern audiences could relate to. I love it.",1111190400,2,281,4.035714285714286

8037798,2,B000637T14,"As mentioned by another reviewer, the box states that there is a host that introduces each film and that there are DVD features and chapter selection. This is simply not true. Amazon did a great job, as usual, shipping the films but Timeless Media should provide a refund for false advertising. As historically important as these films may be, they really aren't entertaining without the commentary, introductions or biographical information found on most other classic films. If that's not important to you, then I would say that the quality of the film is good so you will probably enjoy it. If, like me, you are interested in the history of film and the actors portrayed, then this is definitely a miss.",1367798400,18,706,4.8429752066115705
8037799,5,B000637T14,"I decided to buy some silent movies, just for historical sake. My grandmother used to tell me about the movie stars of the past, and all things  involving their lives and career. I just wanted to see what the hub-bub was about, and compare it to my time, and how things have evolved from then to now. Very interesting, from many aspects. The acting was so dramatic, and exaggerated, until it was kind of amusing. The men wore just as much make-up as the women. And they were the leading men of that day?  My grandmother really used to talk about Rudolph Valentino so I had to see him and all the femme fatales she told me about. (Oh, Grandma) I got a chance to look into the past, and see what  she saw at the movies, when she was dating.  It was fun. I'll buy more.",1364256000,4,766,4.190476190476191
