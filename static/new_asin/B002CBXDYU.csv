8363876,5,B002CBXDYU,"I was very proud of John and how he handled his show in Australia, even though the mentality, some of their reactions, and certainly the pronunciation of the English language in Australia is significantly different from ours.  John Edward stays true to his style, where his honesty and simplicity and wish to help people always shine through.  No matter where he is, or how large the audience is.  Amazing!  I just wish more readings had been shown.  Will there be another DVD about this or any other trip?  I  Hope so!",1406246400,,519,4.637362637362638
