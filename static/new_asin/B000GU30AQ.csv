2619649,5,B000GU30AQ,"This DVD is just wonderful. Brings tears to my eyes. I showed it to my Confirmation class for a vocations class. Man, did it get their attention! These movie makers are not only wonderful crafters of their art, but they truly are inspired. Every Catholic education program should show this. It not only explains the priesthood, but the faith as well. Buy it. Watch it. Show it.",1191024000,5,377,4.641791044776119
2619650,5,B000GU30AQ,I have watched and shown this video a few times since last year. And it is an inspiring call to discernment of the priestly vocation. It shows men who have answered the call to the Catholic priesthood and looks into their motivations for giving their life to God. It is a short yet heartfelt call to those who are considering such a vocation and is worth seeing by all. It shows what it means to have a true calling to the Catholic priesthood. Every vocation director should have a copy of this short documentary.,1188864000,4,513,4.468085106382978
2619651,5,B000GU30AQ,"""Fishers of Men"" is a heartfelt and inspiring documentary about men who have answered the call to the Catholic priesthood. Though short (18 min.,)the film is an engaging look at what motivates a man to give his life to God in the service of His church. Replete with fast-paced images and catching music, this is a perfect film for vocation talks, as well as many parish gatherings like prayer & youth groups. I was particularly taken by the stirring images of Pope John Paul II and the wonderful stories the men told of what an inspiration the late pontiff had been to their vocations. ""Fishers of Men"" is highly recommended as a joyful & positive example of what truly means to become a Catholic priest.",1187395200,8,704,4.64
2619652,5,B000GU30AQ,"This is a powerful documentary which in 18 minutes portrays the Catholic priesthood in its full capacity and spiritual power.  Every young Catholic man or teenager should see this movie, whether they are thinking about the priesthood or not.  It shows that only real men can be priests:  no wimps allowed.  I am a happily married man and father, but if I had seen this movie before I met my wife, I would have been applying the same day for the seminary.",1185667200,12,454,4.5
2619653,5,B000GU30AQ,"This brings into light the awesome responsibility, privilege and power that is bestowed onto a priest.

8134634,5,B000GU30AQ,"A very moving short promotion on the vocation to the priesthood. I showed it to my 4th and 5th grade CCD students and the kids really liked it. There is a underlying theme of A person who was killed in a car accident, so may not be appropriate 4 second grade students.",1463702400,,268,4.173076923076923

8134640,5,B000GU30AQ,"This video was used during our parish three-day Lenten Retreat, and the retreatants were deeply moved by it.  While the video was made for priestly vocation recruitment, in actual fact it speaks to all of us in different ways -- about the fulfillment of our own personal vocations in Christ, in renewing our realization of the priest as ""Christ"" in the sacraments, in renewing our spiritual fervor, and in being willing to guide our children to spiritual lives if not to the religious life.  I found it powerful.",1358812800,,512,4.806818181818182
8134641,5,B000GU30AQ,"I cannot give enough praise for this short video, only 18 min, but it PACKS A PUNCH!  It is a beautiful rendition of the true everyday life of a priest - giving himself in service to God.  The work of a priest is presented in its beauty and this video truly brings a greater appreciation for the conviction and vital purpose of these men of God.",1344211200,,345,4.212121212121212
