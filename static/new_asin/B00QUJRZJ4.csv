6886863,5,B00QUJRZJ4,"I'm a self-professed Jerichoholic since his early WCW days, so you can note that skew in my review.

This set is different than his first WWE DVD in the sense that it uses the format WWE has been using for match compilations like in the Shawn Michaels: Mr. WrestleMania, the Best of Sting, or the Bret Hart: Dungeon Collection. We get short interviews before each match. It makes each match on the set feel important, even when Jericho himself states he hasn't re-watched that specific match. The other nice touch to this set is that they use a gimmick during the interviews. Interviewing Jericho while he is in a limo may seem a bit ricockulous (Jerichoism ... TM), but if nothing else, it gave us a different backdrop then we usually get for these interviews. The start and stop pace might not always work for these style of sets, but it works well and matches the gimmick of the Road is Jericho.

The stories themselves are pretty good. Nothing Earth-shattering is revealed that wasn't already in one of his books or someplace else. HOWEVER, there are little golden nuggets revealed throughout that haven't been recorded till now. For example, when he's talking about having to have his matches approved by X-Pac early on during his WWE career, he relates an interesting small golden nugget. During the catch match, he thought a cool visual would be to apply the Walls of Jericho on the top of the cage. He asked for a platform to be installed so he could do that and he recounted that when he went to the top of the cage during his Bray Wyatt match, he thought it was neat that they were still there. He had a hand in getting those there for future spots for other workers. You can find a new little piece of info in almost every segment. Jericho is a good story-teller, so if you enjoy his promos or interviews, you will enjoy these yarns.

The matches are a nice collection spanning Y2J's US career. ECW, WCW, and WWE are all featured here. There were some matches on the set that Jericho had admitted to not having seen again, or in some cases, even remembered. One such match was with ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin that had Mick Foley as the special guest outside referee. Jericho said he wanted to include it not only for the people involved, but also for the fact that when you have such a long, storied career, you sometimes forget big moments like this. He officially joined the ranks of the wrestling snobs, he said about that rather self-deprecatingly. The match collection itself uses primarily rare gems from forgotten Raws, Smackdowns, or pay-per-view shows, as opposed to classics that you could catch on any number of sets. It even includes a dark match with John Cena! The set features bouts with Pit Bull #2, Ultimo Dragon, Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Jeff Hardy, Shawn Michaels, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk, and more.

It's not a feature-length documentary set with matches to follow. You could potentially dig around for almost all these matches on other collections or find them on the Network BUT the mere fact you get a some new interviews with Chris Jericho that contain new information yet to be revealed anywhere else makes the set worth it. The setup stories to the matches make it a great set. Also, the fact that nearly all these bouts are in HD makes it a must buy. If you're a wrestling fan, this is a good ""rare gem"" collection to have with nice revelations about key Jericho and WWE moments never heard before. If you're a WWE fan or Jerichoholic ... it's an instant buy, Junior.",1426723200,7,3503,4.6

6886865,5,B00QUJRZJ4,"The only things that should be reviewed here are shipping speed, quality of the physical product, and if needed, how quickly the item was refunded or replaced if it was broken. Why must every hopeful blogger use this as a platform to discuss their ""inside knowledge"" of the business or how the feel about the match they saw on YouTube for free?",1426550400,,344,4.564516129032258
6886866,3,B00QUJRZJ4,"The matches are pretty good and he's entertaining, but this isn't as good as his last DVD ""Breaking the Code"". That one is like a 3 hour documentary where he goes in depth into his career and back stage. This is more ""hey will you talk about this match for 2 minutes before we show it"". It's still worth watching, but for those looking for the more sit down interview for 3 hours type of WWE DVD, this isn't that.",1426118400,4,413,4.175
6886867,4,B00QUJRZJ4,"This is the second DVD collection coming from a man who goes under a heavy variety of nicknames, made wrestling history on more than one occasion, and became a crossover entertainment superstar from his acting to music to most recently hosting a popular podcast...this man is Chris Jericho. This set takes the format of a match anthology with Jericho himself not only hosting the DVD set during a limo ride from New York to Philadelphia (having some funny blooper moments on the way there) but also speaking on various subjects before each match such as either his opponent or feud going into that match along with other subjects such as the importance of the ECW Television Championship, his history with Ultimo Dragon dating back to their days in Japan, being able to finally showcase his personality in WCW, the difficulties of going from WCW to WWE & who Vince had tutor him, various innovations & ideas he had that WWE still uses today, who he feels is the most underrated performer, his definition of ""Dicaprio"", why Triple H didn't like him & the significance of the match picked for this set, how he compares himself to George Harrison & matches to ""Stairway To Heaven"", who his original WrestleMania XIX opponent was suppose to be, the ""IT"" factor, significance of Madison Square Garden to him since before wrestling, and a funny story behind his jacket at WrestleMania.

Normally I give my summary at the end of the review but I'll just give it now as the positives is that this set delivered what was advertised for the most part in that we've gotten quality encounters that usually are forgotten about when looking over Jericho's career while hearing him speak on certain subjects is a bonus as well.  The negatives is what I just said in ""for the most part"" as some of these matches just weren't good quality or significant at all (his Booker T match in 2001) & some matches never released onto a ""Chris Jericho"" set but been released elsewhere or is available through the WWE Network so I would have preferred if a different match that isn't available besides one previously released in some cases up to twice or three different times before (i.e. Mysterio at the Bash could have been replaced by their rare final encounter on SmackDown for the I.C. title, the World Title rematch between Jericho vs. Rock or their SmackDown match from April 2002, the Steel Cage match for the World Championship with Punk back in 2008, ect.) but I can't win them all so overall it's still a quality collection.

Matches Include:
vs. ECW Television Champion Pitbull #2 - Pitbull showcased his strength advantage early by easily overpowering Jericho in the early moments by repeatably forcing him down to the mat & even to the outside while being able to keep catching him in mid-offense only to counter with a power move only for Jericho to change his strategy with an aerial assault using various lucha libre influence offense along with various kicks as they traded momentum with both men being able to counter each other's offense along with Pitbull continuing to not only use his power to keep catching Jericho but also ground him & Jericho continuing to go to the air & use his educated feet before another man who had an interest in this championship match made his presence known around ringside.
ECW Hardcore Heaven '96

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Ultimate Dragon - It was noted by the commentators in the early stages of this match that both men knew each other so well from facing each other numerous times not only in WCW but Japan & Mexico as well. That fact was showcased early as both men were exchanging & countering the same holds against each other that either one was able to get the advantage leading to a stalemate & a moment later on when Jericho attempted a cradle only for Dragon to counter it & do the move right back to Jericho. They get more aggressive such as Dragon hitting Jericho with loud stiff kicks & even catching Jericho in midair during the Lionsault with a dropkick while Jericho delivered back to back powerbombs. This was a highly intense & competitive match that showcased what Jericho has said himself numerous times, ""crusierweight action was one of the forgotten reasons WCW was able to dominate during the Monday Night Wars.""
WCW Bash At The Beach '97
[Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

WCW Crusierweight Championship Match vs. Dean Malenko - For weeks leading up to this match, Jericho mocked Dean Malenko to the point where he made up his own his moniker of being ""The Man Of 1,004 Holds"" & had the #1,004 on his outfit. Malenko out-wrestled Jericho early to the point where he almost walked out of the match leading Dean to break the count. They traded momentum throughout the match with Jericho attempting backbreaker & chinlock submissions while Malenko at one point was able to reverse an attempted frankensteiner off the top rope into his famous top rope gutbuster. Jericho was eventually able to catch Malenko in the Liontamer for the submission victory causing Gene Okerland afterwords to call Malenko out on the fact that he's lost all his attempts to regain the Crusierweight Championship in the past few months causing Malenko just declare he was going ""home.""  Little did anyone know it at the time but this was the beginning of what can be considered one of the first times the crusierweight championship was beginning to be given ""storylines"" to it instead of it being just based off wrestling alone.
WCW Uncensored '98

Steel Cage Match vs. X-Pac - This was held under the rules where you could only win by escaping the cage as both men started brawling on the outside before finally entering the cage with one man having the door slammed on him face first allowing his head to be heavily focused on as both men had their bodies thrown against the cage several times including a backdrop directly into it before landing directly on their head while delievering some impactful offense such as powerbomb off the top rope while later just being tossed off the top of the cage along with a submission applied on the top of the cage & a chair being brought into the match as this was competitive between both men from start to finish to the point where one man was out of action for months following this.
No Mercy '00

Last Man Standing Match vs. Kane - This started over coffee but after the constant attacks by Kane, Jericho himself started to be more aggressive taking the fights to Kane resulting in this match as they met each other in the isleway fighting backstage right away using whatever was around from an anvil case to a shovel before making their way to ringside with the ringpost & steps used as a weapon as Kane as dominate beating on Jericho's back with holds like a powerslam on the floor & bearhug into the post before Jericho refused to stay down & kept begging for more which Kane delivered with a powerful chokeslam & chairshot to the back. Jericho resorted to tactics like using the chair himself including a lionsault onto the chair on top of Kane & taking the fight to the stage area with a faceplant through a table & literally ""breaking the walls down"" onto Kane. This was a physically aggressive match.

with special outside enforcer Mick Foley vs. WWE Champion Steve Austin - Austin came into this match with a sore back from his battles (and heavy amount of german suplexes) with Chris Benoit the week before as Austin jumped on Jericho before the bell to the point where Jericho wasn't able to take off his tag team title belt before he was able to recover with various dropkicks & chops along with countering Austin's own offense making Austin resort to his brawling tactics on the outside while focusing on the lower back as they traded momentum including using the same dirty tactics against each other while Foley did get involved when necessary on the outside before someone else who resented Foley's authority decided to make his presence known as well in what was a competitive match between both men.
""RAW"" June '01
[WWF Action]

vs. WCW Champion Booker T - Shane McMahon was in Booker's corner as Jericho started out in control by taking Booker off his feet multiple times while going aerial with his springboard dropkicks & top rope crossbody while Booker resorted to his various styles of kicks along with Shane McMahon causing a distraction when necessary as this was a solid encounter but they would go on to have better (see their feud in 2003) as this was more of a backdrop to the various storylines in regards to how the issues between the WWE & WCW/ECW Alliance went further than just the wrestlers.
""RAW"" July '01

WCW Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle - It should be noted that not only was Angle the WCW United States Champion coming into this match but also recently joined the Alliance setting up this match here was they traded momentum early on with each other taking the other down multiple times while trading fist & executing their own styles of suplexes before Jericho was able to take advantage of the environment around ringside to gain an advantage only for Angle to get more aggressive with his strikes & various suplexes including one executed catching Jericho off the top rope as both men continued to go back & forth countering & even attempting their opponents signature moves in what was a back & forth competitive contest.
Rebellion '01

WWE Undisputed Championship Match vs. The Rock - Jericho mocked Rock's ""Just Bring It"" which fired up the Rock to the point where he chased after Jericho & tackled him back into the ring before Jericho was able to get some offense in by grounding Rock with moves like his Lionsault & bulldog but kept making very arrogant covers. Rock was caught Jericho off guard into the sharpshooter but Jericho regained the momentum due to a few distractions & even ripped off the Rock Bottom but was caught when attempting the People's Elbow with the Rock punishing Jericho using the steps & announce table on the outside. They kept fighting back in the ring with Jericho eventually catching Rock in the Walls Of Jericho while Rock was able to execute an impactful DDT & later the People's Elbow. This was like their previous No Mercy championship match with the difference being that Jericho was in full heel mode from relying on cheating & outside help while mocking The Rock whenever he could but still a competitive match.

[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

vs. Triple H - The winner of this match would face the Undisputed Champion Hulk Hogan next week & their one on one rematch from WrestleMania as Triple H immediately targeted Jericho's arm & shoulder including using part of the ring to his advantage before Jericho was able to use the outside of the ring to his advantage busting open Triple H in the process while focusing on the head & neck area as they went back & forth with a series of counters & reversals while executing some of the same offense against each other along in a match that was better quality than their previous Mania match.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '02

vs. Jeff Hardy - Hardy came out real strong with punches & a head scissors takeover causing Jericho to resort to tactics such as choking Hardy with his own towel as Hardy continued to use his daredevil offense to his advantage both in & outside of the ring while Jericho attempted to ground Hardy by heavily focusing on his back area as they traded momentum until one man was finally able to catch the other.
""RAW"" Feb. '03

vs. Edge - A ladder was setup at ringside as both of these men were set to participant in the first Money In The Bank Ladder Match at WrestleMania as Jericho targeted Edge's bad arm with stretches & submissions while staying one step ahead countering Edge's repeated attempt at offense to the point where Edge ended up hurting himself at times when performing moves of his own causing him to adjust his offense using moves like the body scissors as they went back & forth throughout the rest of the match using similar tactics such as avoiding each other's signature moves.
""RAW"" Mar. '05

Last Man Standing Match vs. Shawn Michaels - This was set to the final match in their feud throughout the year with HBK dominating & taking the match to the outside early where both men continued to fight in the isleway & use the props on the stage area to their advantage such as a catapult into the mailbox & being hit with the camera boom while both men took their bumps on the cab car parked to the side of the entrance before another infamous weapon that both men had a reputation for using in the past as early as their last match at the previous PPV came into play before more weapons from a chair & the announce table to the World Championship itself came into play as this came down to one man delievering the perfect blow that the other couldn't recover from with the bigger story being exactly who delivered that knockout blow.
""RAW"" Nov. '08

Street Fight vs. World Champion John Cena - This was a post-RAW ""dark match"" as Jericho took advantage of a referee distraction taking advantage of the environment around ringside using whatever he could get his hands on to beat on Cena along with taunting Cena's father in the front row before settling back in the ring as Jericho brought weapons into the ring while along countering whatever offense Cena was able to attempt while continuing to take shortcuts when possible.  This was the stereotypical type of match that Cena gets criticized for before he was on the defense for the entire match until the very end which completely goes against all the comments Jericho made in regards to Cena's in-ring work ethic in the interview segment before this match.
Dec. '08

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - Mysterio must win the championship or forever unmask as Jericho targeted the mask right away while using his superior size to his advantage such as catching Rey various times & swinging him into the outside barricade before Rey was able to use Jericho's own momentum against him along with his lucha libre high flying offense including a legdrop executed from a double springboard as they traded momentum with both men finding unique ways to constantly counter the others signature offense as this came down to one man's obsession working against him in what was a very competitive contest.

Street Fight Match vs. WWE Champion C.M. Punk - Punk not only returns home but also returns of ""the scene of the crime"" of where he first became a WWE Champion close to a year earlier in Chicago with Punk's family at ringside & both men dressed in their street clothes for this match. You knew where this match was going when Punk brought in a kendo stick during the first minute of the match with Jericho kept going outside to break Punk's momentum & even went as far as to hide behind the referee to gain the advantage & use the stick himself. Both men brawled on the outside with Jericho going as far as to taunt Punk's sister which made Punk ""snap"" resulting in Jericho getting slammed through the announce table hood before Jericho retaliated with the monitor & breaking the rest of the hood over his back before Jericho got too cocky & began pouring beer on Punk's back with Punk coming back with a low blow using the stick. They went back & forth after this with counters to the Lionsault & GTS along, the unique escapes from the Walls Of Jericho & Anaconda Vice, a SAVAGE elbow through the announce table followed by a Codebreaker with a steel chair, and attempting to use the other's finisher. They topped their WrestleMania match which was quality in it's own right as it really did come off as a brawl between two men who wanted to beat the hell out of each other with the added drama of Punk's sister being the crowd definitely helped.
Extreme Rules '12

vs. Rob Van Dam - This was RVD's first singles match in WWE since 2007 as they went back & forth early with RVD relying on his educated feet & athleticism such as the standing moonsault along with grounding Jericho with his own body scissors while Jericho was able to counter his offense with some impactful offense of his own along such as a powerbomb & spike DDT with using his own athleticism as they continued to trade momentum avoiding the other's signature moves in a hard fought quality match.
""RAW"" July '13

Steel Cage Match: Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men were trading blows & stopping each other's attempts at escaping early on before one man was able to start using the cage to his advantage using his opponents momentum against him to send him into & sandwitching him against the cage only for his opponent to use the same tactics as well using the cage as a weapon as both men traded momentum such as countering each other's trademark offense along with taking some big high risk attempts from the top rope & even off the top of the cage as it literally came down to the wire between both men in such an evenly matched contest from start to finish.
""RAW"" Sept. '14
[Best Of RAW & SmackDown 2014]

vs. Randy Orton - Jericho started out in control with a fast pace & taking the action to the outside early on using the ringside environment to his advantage before Orton was able to gain the advantage & keep it slowing down the pace & taking advantage of any openings such as coming into the ring or when he was on the top rope or coming into the corner along with also giving a receipt for Jericho's actions on the outside earlier as both men continued to trade momentum delivering sequences of counters & reversals to each others offense followed by delivering a signature move of their own including each man playing mind games suckering the their opponent in resulting in a competitive match that saw Orton show more personality than usual as far as interaction with not only the crowd but a moment with an announcer at ringside.
Night Of Champions '14

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship/Ladder Match vs. Christian - These two were feuding with each other for months over Trish Stratus but after going through regular matches, handicap matches, and cage matches (where Christian injured his back & was out of action for months) they settled their score in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship after Edge had to forfeit the title due to injury. Both men started out wrestling before it turned into a brawl in the crowd & the outside using the cable cord to choke while Christian was able to do his Unprettier on the floor. The ladder then came into play with both men being thrown into the ladder, ladder using it as a weapon like Jericho using it to work on Christian's back while Jericho's leg was damaged when thrown into it, and making moves more impactful like the Lionsault & bulldog, and both men taking face first falls from the ladder & even from the hanging title. This match was more about trying to tell a story throughout the match instead of doing a bunch of ""high spots"" & turned out to be a great match.

[The Ladder Match]

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - Rey came after Jericho right away with a double leg takedown & taking him over the top rope only for Jericho to use the environment on the outside of the ring to his advantage as Rey continued to use his aerial assault from top rope to springboard offense along with some impactful moves such as powerbomb against Jericho while Jericho was able to stay a step ahead countering some of the Rey's moves into either his own or pin attempts while constantly focusing on the one thing that distracts Rey more than anything else in a non-stop fast paced match.
""RAW"" June '09

(Blu-Ray) vs. Evan Bourne - The fans were split between these two as this was a very fast paced match that had a mix of both high flying & grounded wrestling from both men. Bourne early on showed great athleticism as he did a standing vertical leap that was high enough to deliver a frankensteiner onto Jericho who was sitting on the top rope while later doing a move that Jericho was able to counter into the Walls Of Jericho in one quick motion & Bourne doing Air Bourne but landing on his feet right into a codebreaker. Personally, this was my favorite match of the night as I felt these two stole the show.
Fatal 4 Way '10

(Blu-Ray) vs. C.M. Punk - Punk's first appearance since RAW two weeks after WrestleMania as both men stated grounding each other early with Jericho starting to gain an advantage before Punk was able counter his springboard dropkick to gain the advantage working over Jericho's arm with a keylock as Jericho picked up the pace with a double axe handle & bulldog. Both men from here started to trade momentum with countering each other's offense such a lionsault into a swinging neckbreaker only for the lionsault to be executed after countering a bulldog, the Walls Of Jericho reversed into the Anaconda Vice but Jericho eventually applying the hold after countering the GTS while both men just went back & forth with their offense like Punk's Savage elbow & GTS along with Jericho catching Punk in mid-air while Paul Heyman made his presence known at one point only for it to distract both men. This match was the high quality that's expected & deliver from both men against each other.

They kept fighting back in the ring with Jericho eventually catching Rock in the Walls Of Jericho while Rock was able to execute an impactful DDT & later the People's Elbow. This was like their previous No Mercy championship match with the difference being that Jericho was in full heel mode from relying on cheating & outside help while mocking The Rock whenever he could but still a competitive match.

[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

vs. Triple H - The winner of this match would face the Undisputed Champion Hulk Hogan next week & their one on one rematch from WrestleMania as Triple H immediately targeted Jericho's arm & shoulder including using part of the ring to his advantage before Jericho was able to use the outside of the ring to his advantage busting open Triple H in the process while focusing on the head & neck area as they went back & forth with a series of counters & reversals while executing some of the same offense against each other along in a match that was better quality than their previous Mania match.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '02

vs. Jeff Hardy - Hardy came out real strong with punches & a head scissors takeover causing Jericho to resort to tactics such as choking Hardy with his own towel as Hardy continued to use his daredevil offense to his advantage both in & outside of the ring while Jericho attempted to ground Hardy by heavily focusing on his back area as they traded momentum until one man was finally able to catch the other.
""RAW"" Feb. '03

vs. Edge - A ladder was setup at ringside as both of these men were set to participant in the first Money In The Bank Ladder Match at WrestleMania as Jericho targeted Edge's bad arm with stretches & submissions while staying one step ahead countering Edge's repeated attempt at offense to the point where Edge ended up hurting himself at times when performing moves of his own causing him to adjust his offense using moves like the body scissors as they went back & forth throughout the rest of the match using similar tactics such as avoiding each other's signature moves.
""RAW"" Mar. '05

Last Man Standing Match vs. Shawn Michaels - This was set to the final match in their feud throughout the year with HBK dominating & taking the match to the outside early where both men continued to fight in the isleway & use the props on the stage area to their advantage such as a catapult into the mailbox & being hit with the camera boom while both men took their bumps on the cab car parked to the side of the entrance before another infamous weapon that both men had a reputation for using in the past as early as their last match at the previous PPV came into play before more weapons from a chair & the announce table to the World Championship itself came into play as this came down to one man delievering the perfect blow that the other couldn't recover from with the bigger story being exactly who delivered that knockout blow.
""RAW"" Nov. '08

Street Fight vs. World Champion John Cena - This was a post-RAW ""dark match"" as Jericho took advantage of a referee distraction taking advantage of the environment around ringside using whatever he could get his hands on to beat on Cena along with taunting Cena's father in the front row before settling back in the ring as Jericho brought weapons into the ring while along countering whatever offense Cena was able to attempt while continuing to take shortcuts when possible.  This was the stereotypical type of match that Cena gets criticized for before he was on the defense for the entire match until the very end which completely goes against all the comments Jericho made in regards to Cena's in-ring work ethic in the interview segment before this match.
Dec. '08

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - Mysterio must win the championship or forever unmask as Jericho targeted the mask right away while using his superior size to his advantage such as catching Rey various times & swinging him into the outside barricade before Rey was able to use Jericho's own momentum against him along with his lucha libre high flying offense including a legdrop executed from a double springboard as they traded momentum with both men finding unique ways to constantly counter the others signature offense as this came down to one man's obsession working against him in what was a very competitive contest.
The Bash '09
[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010; Superstar Collection: Rey Mysterio]

w/Big Show vs. D-Generation-X vs. John Cena & Undertaker - This was a preview match for the upcoming Survivor Series where both sets of champions were facing one of the other tag teams in a triple threat match for their title so the champions in Cena & Taker teamed up to face both teams here with one man from each team being legal at the same time & it was non-stop fast paced action that had it's various highlights such as old rivalries being renewed between all the participants including Shawn Michaels & Undertaker facing off for the first time since their WrestleMania 25 encounter & one signature move delivered after another at one point with not one team but one man leaving the last impression at the end.
""RAW"" Nov. '09
[Best Of RAW 2009; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden; Blu-Ray Edition of DX: One Last Stand]

Street Fight Match vs. WWE Champion C.M. Punk - Punk not only returns home but also returns of ""the scene of the crime"" of where he first became a WWE Champion close to a year earlier in Chicago with Punk's family at ringside & both men dressed in their street clothes for this match. You knew where this match was going when Punk brought in a kendo stick during the first minute of the match with Jericho kept going outside to break Punk's momentum & even went as far as to hide behind the referee to gain the advantage & use the stick himself. Both men brawled on the outside with Jericho going as far as to taunt Punk's sister which made Punk ""snap"" resulting in Jericho getting slammed through the announce table hood before Jericho retaliated with the monitor & breaking the rest of the hood over his back before Jericho got too cocky & began pouring beer on Punk's back with Punk coming back with a low blow using the stick. They went back & forth after this with counters to the Lionsault & GTS along, the unique escapes from the Walls Of Jericho & Anaconda Vice, a SAVAGE elbow through the announce table followed by a Codebreaker with a steel chair, and attempting to use the other's finisher. They topped their WrestleMania match which was quality in it's own right as it really did come off as a brawl between two men who wanted to beat the hell out of each other with the added drama of Punk's sister being the crowd definitely helped.
Extreme Rules '12

vs. Rob Van Dam - This was RVD's first singles match in WWE since 2007 as they went back & forth early with RVD relying on his educated feet & athleticism such as the standing moonsault along with grounding Jericho with his own body scissors while Jericho was able to counter his offense with some impactful offense of his own along such as a powerbomb & spike DDT with using his own athelticsm as they continued to trade momentum avoiding the other's signature moves in a hard fought quality match.
""RAW"" July '13

Steel Cage Match: Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men were trading blows & stopping each other's attempts at escaping early on before one man was able to start using the cage to his advantage using his opponents momentum against him to send him into & sandwitching him against the cage only for his opponent to use the same tactics as well using the cage as a weapon as both men traded momentum such as countering each other's trademark offense along with taking some big high risk attempts from the top rope & even off the top of the cage as it literally came down to the wire between both men in such an evenly matched contest from start to finish.
""RAW"" Sept. '14
[Best Of RAW & SmackDown 2014]

vs. Randy Orton - Jericho started out in control with a fast pace & taking the action to the outside early on using the ringside environment to his advantage before Orton was able to gain the advantage & keep it slowing down the pace & taking advantage of any openings such as coming into the ring or when he was on the top rope or coming into the corner along with also giving a receipt for Jericho's actions on the outside earlier as both men continued to trade momentum delivering sequences of counters & reversals to each others offense followed by delivering a signature move of their own including each man playing mind games suckering the their opponent in resulting in a competitive match that saw Orton show more personality than usual as far as interaction with not only the crowd but a moment with an announcer at ringside.
Night Of Champions '14

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship/Ladder Match vs. Christian - These two were feuding with each other for months over Trish Stratus but after going through regular matches, handicap matches, and cage matches (where Christian injured his back & was out of action for months) they settled their score in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship after Edge had to forfeit the title due to injury. Both men started out wrestling before it turned into a brawl in the crowd & the outside using the cable cord to choke while Christian was able to do his Unprettier on the floor. The ladder then came into play with both men being thrown into the ladder, ladder using it as a weapon like Jericho using it to work on Christian's back while Jericho's leg was damaged when thrown into it, and making moves more impactful like the Lionsault & bulldog, and both men taking face first falls from the ladder & even from the hanging title. This match was more about trying to tell a story throughout the match instead of doing a bunch of ""high spots"" & turned out to be a great match.
Unforgiven '04
[The Ladder Match]

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - Rey came after Jericho right away with a double leg takedown & taking him over the top rope only for Jericho to use the environment on the outside of the ring to his advantage as Rey continued to use his aerial assault from top rope to springboard offense along with some impactful moves such as powerbomb against Jericho while Jericho was able to stay a step ahead countering some of the Rey's moves into either his own or pin attempts while constantly focusing on the one thing that distracts Rey more than anything else in a non-stop fast paced match.
""RAW"" June '09

(Blu-Ray) vs. Evan Bourne - The fans were split between these two as this was a very fast paced match that had a mix of both high flying & grounded wrestling from both men. Bourne early on showed great athleticism as he did a standing vertical leap that was high enough to deliever a frankensteiner onto Jericho who was sitting on the top rope while later doing a move that Jericho was able to counter into the Walls Of Jericho in one quick motion & Bourne doing Air Bourne but landing on his feet right into a codebreaker. Personally, this was my favorite match of the night as I felt these two stole the show.
Fatal 4 Way '10

(Blu-Ray) vs. C.M. Punk - Punk's first appearance since RAW two weeks after WrestleMania as both men stated grounding each other early with Jericho starting to gain an advantage before Punk was able counter his springboard dropkick to gain the advantage working over Jericho's arm with a keylock as Jericho picked up the pace with a double axe handle & bulldog. Both men from here started to trade momentum with countering each other's offense such a lionsault into a swinging neckbreaker only for the lionsault to be executed after countering a bulldog, the Walls Of Jericho reversed into the Anaconda Vice but Jericho eventually applying the hold after countering the GTS while both men just went back & forth with their offense like Punk's Savage elbow & GTS along with Jericho catching Punk in mid-air while Paul Heyman made his presence known at one point only for it to distract both men. This match was the high quality that's expected & deliver from both men against each other.

8693056,5,B00QUJRZJ4,"I've seen so many of these WWE collections, it's really hard to pick a single favorite, but Y2J rarely disappoints. This might be even better than ""Breaking the Code,"" which was a great set itself--it's just that Jericho has had such a stellar career, you rarely get a bad match to look at. And like his first set, Chris himself is here, riding in a limo and setting the backdrop for most of the matches.

Not too much time is spent on ECW or WCW, just get to the real highpoint of his career, the WWE. Every opponent or match here could be called epic--a few that standout; Kane, Austin, Angle, Booker T, The Rock and CM Punk.

Some good storytelling too as far as Chris talking about some of the behind the scenes nuggets, like the Vince McMahon classic of starting a feud over hot coffee or the jacket that wouldn't work properly at WrestleMania.
