8392340,5,B0039UU3IM,"""The Man With Two Faces"" is a 1934 Warner Brothers film starring Edward G. Robinson and Mary Astor with Ricardo Cortez, Louis Calhern, and Mae Clarke. It has elements of the type of film noir that Robinson, Calhern, and Astor would become increasingly more involved with.

Edward G Robinson (1893-1973) gained fame as ""Little Caesar"" (1931) but argued strongly to be permitted to play non-gangster roles, which he did in several subsequent films such as ""Five Star Final"" (1931), ""Tiger Shark"" (1932), and ""Kid Galahad"" (1937). By 1944 he was almost completely out of the gangster genre. In this film he plays an stage actor and director, and Astor's brother.

Mary Astor (1906-87) is best remembered as Mrs. O'Shaughnessy from ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), although she won the Oscar for her role in ""The Great Lie"" which appeared the same year and is now mostly forgotten. Astor made more than 100 films from 1921 to 1964 (""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"") and was a major star in the silent era. She plays an actress whose life is threatened by a controlling husband.
It was not at all uncommon for Hollywood actresses to be controlled by their families (e.g., Clara Bow, Jean Harlow) and for this to become fodder for Hollywood films.

Louis Calhern (1895-1956) plays her long lost husband who returns. Calhern was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Magnificent Yankee"" (1950). He was in more than 70 films and gave memorable performances as Buffalo Bill in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" (1950) and a Nazi spy boss in ""Notorious"" (1946). I liked him best as the criminal attorney in ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950). Though Calhern was a good actor, he has none of the charisma necessary to believe that he can exert such control over Astor and the rest of the cast. The role calls for the type of charisma exercised in films like ""Svengali"" (John Barrymore in 1931) and ""Dracula"" (Bela Lugosi in 1931) but Calhern isn't up to the task.

Ricardo Cortez (1900-77) appeared in 100+ films, starting in the silent era. Although he was Jewish of Austrian descent, he often played a Latino and changed his name from Jacob Krantz to capitalize on the Valentino craze. He played in a host of B movies. He plays Astor's manager.

Mae Clarke (1910-1992) will forever be known as the blond moll who got a grapefruit smashed into her face by Jimmy Cagney in ""Public Enemy"" (1931), but she made over 100 films and gave us many memorable roles, such as Dr. Frankenstein's wife in the original ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and Myra Deauville in ""Waterloo Bridge"" (1931). Clarke plays Robinson's girl friend. She is a complete hoot in the role. She doesn't get that much screen time, but every time she is on, she shines.

Archie Mayo (1891-1968) directed more than 80 films from 1917 to 1946. He was an eclectic, making a variety of films from the Marx Brothers' ""A Night in Casablanca"" (1946) to Bogart in ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936), Cagney in ""The Mayor of Hell"" (1933), and Gary Cooper in ""The Adventures of Marco Polo"" (1938). Interestingly, Mayo directed ""Svengali"" (1931) which has clear parallels to this film.

The film is a little stagey, showing its origins as a stage play (""The Dark Tower"") by George S Kaufman and Alexander Woolcott.

The NY Times said Robinson ""is at his hammy best"" and called the film an ""excellent film version of The Dark Tower"".

1934 was an OK year for films. The top box office slots went to ""Viva Villa"", ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"". ""It Happened One Night"" was the big Oscar winner. That year ""The Thin Man"" series began, Karloff and Lugosi appeared in ""The Black Cat"", Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced in ""The Gay Divorcee"", Laurel and Hardy laughed it up in ""Babes in Toyland"", and Howard Hawks' ""Twentieth Century"" came out.

This is a pretty standard mid 30s film with nothing to recommend it except for Robinson's bravura performance. This may be his finest performance ever, and surely at least second if you put ""Little Caesar"" as his best. Robinson plays a typical pretentious narcissistic Broadway director, and you can see that he relishes the chance to poke fun at his colleagues. He's simply marvelous. Then, mid film, he assumes the identity of a Frenchman and disappears completely in the role. Later we watch as he takes off his makeup and Robinson slowly emerges - it's a fantastic bit of acting, and comes inside a film in which he has been acting a completely different part. Take into account that only a few years earlier he had rocked the screen with one of the finest performances of a gangster, and you can see that Edward G. Robinson was one of the best actors of the 20th Century.",1304467200,4,4633,4.751243781094527
8392341,4,B0039UU3IM,"Warner Bros. Pictures/First National Pictures presents ""THE MAN WITH TWO FACES"" (1934) (72 min/B&W) -- Starring Edward G. Robinson, Mary Astor, Ricardo Cortez, Mae Clarke &  Louis Calhern

Directed by Archie Mayo

The film showcases Edward G. Robinson, who as an actor who impersonates another man in order to rid his sister of her deadbeat hubby, played by Louis Calhern. Calhern is less successful in his portrayal, giving a performance with little charisma or magnetism but still good, making it hard to believe that a woman like Mary Astor would be drawn to him.

Another great performance from Robinson, with an enjoyable over the top role.  Calhern and Astor give a moving characterization sometimes shades of a stage play.

The films ending is a rare find, with Robinson about to be arrested by Ricardo Cortez believing he might be able to win acquittal at his own trial. Watch out for the last minute creeping of insanity mixed with instability, we are left guessing as to what end this story will present itself.

Fine cast and strong direction make this a good view for the fans of pure drama.
