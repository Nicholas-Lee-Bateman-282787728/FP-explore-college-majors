8428009,1,B004FN25KQ,"Beware when description says ""manufactured on demand"" it really means ""does not play"" In small print on the back of the case it reads ""This disc is expected to play in DVD play only devices and may not play in other Dvd devices including recorders and pc drive""  AMAZON does NOT MENTION this fact ANYWHERE in its description of the product! I feel totally ripped off.",1333670400,7,367,4.5606060606060606
