5879801,3,B00DYZ80VE,Looking for something more of video that followed a class. There were long pauses with information. My six year was a bit disappointed but has asked to watch the video several times. It would have been nice if there was information and then an option to follow a class like session.,1309392000,,282,4.549019607843137
5879802,5,B00DYZ80VE,"This is a fun and great introduction to yoga for kids.  The instructor is really good and the poses are simpler.  I was able to do it with my daughter, and she enjoyed watching the other kids too.",1304380800,5,196,4.131578947368421
5879803,5,B00DYZ80VE,"Bryson, my two year old, is constantly going 100 miles an hour.  This DVD stopped him in his tracks and engaged him in a way that focused his energy and calmed him down tremendously.  He mimics the other kids in the DVD with each pose...his favorite is the snake pose.  Marsha Wenig has made yoga completely accessible to young kids by making it enjoyable.  Bryson picks up on the fun that the kids in the program are having and has such a proud sense of accomplishment with each and every pose.  Now, whenever he gets too wound up, we put on Yoga Kids.  Since this is the first yoga DVD that I have tried, I don't know what some of the others are like.  This one is nice because it features young kids on screen.",1302307200,13,713,4.237037037037037
5879804,5,B00DYZ80VE,"We have a number of Yoga videos, including several introductory ones geared towards young children.  Based on my daughter's renewed enthusiasm for yoga after watching Yoga Kids, I have to rate this one as the best.  She now knows all the poses and has fun with them.  What a wonderful product!  It's really brought us closer together, since we do Yoga now together every day.  The music is also quite good and reminds me a bit of Sesame Street in tone.  I definitely recommend this, especially if you want to introduce your child to the joy of yoga.  I see that there is a Yoga Kids 2 2011, which appears to be more poses.  I noticed that the age range on that one goes higher.  I will probably try it, now that my daughter knows all the poses in part one.",1302307200,16,756,4.304964539007092
5879805,3,B00DYZ80VE,"We already have the Yoga Kids volumes 2 and 3... (an alphabet one and the silly to calm), and I was hoping that if we got volume 1 as well, the kids would have more moves to work on - to rotate through some new/different poses.

A lot of the poses in this one were already in one of the other two dvds we have, so I wish I had just skipped getting it.

HOWEVER - that said, I really DO like the yoga kids line. If you don't have any of these, they are great - my kids, who are now 5 and 7, have been doing these for a couple of years. They like doing it, and I like that they get to work on balance and exercise in a way that they enjoy.

I personally'd look for the two-pack that has the other two videos... I think those ones are our favorites, but not a bad buy if it's your first attempt at these.",1301097600,8,801,3.784431137724551
5879806,1,B00DYZ80VE,"I bought many yoga for kids dvd, this one is actually an 2004/5 dvd, they just change the cover to make it look new, it's not 2010. The quality of picture is very bad, with skips. I couldn't believe how they can make it look like a new dvd, but actually 6 yrs old and bad quality copy. Trust me, there are many other good ones out there. Go for storyland, shanti the yogi, those 2 are the best, my kids watch it over and over again.",1300579200,8,432,3.9770114942528734

5879809,5,B00DYZ80VE,My grandson loves this video!!  it is very easy for him to relate to and understand the basic structure of the pose.  I am ordering another set to keep at my house to use when he visitis:),1400889600,,188,4.054054054054054
5879810,3,B00DYZ80VE,Pretty good DVD- more yoga and less talking would have been a lot better- but worth the price. May look for something else bc it's short.,1396483200,,137,4.3076923076923075
5879811,5,B00DYZ80VE,I agree with the other reviewer the picture on the box is deceiving.  My twin boys got this for their fourth birthday and the really enjoy it.  They have no trouble following along to the instructions and are really entertained by the theme of the poses.  The videos are not too long so they can maintain focus on the exercises.  Good video for toddlers up.,1392595200,,357,4.446153846153846

5879814,5,B00DYZ80VE,"She comes home from school everyday to start her practice, first thing. She had spent the weekend with me and my family and had watched me do my practice that weekend. She seemed very interested and was even trying to mimic my movements. I got her a mat and this video and she loves it. I recommend it for anyone with a younger child. It has helped her confidence and he agility. He mom said her grades have even improved due to being more focused. Great Great DVD for kids.",1362960000,,474,4.277777777777778
5879815,5,B00DYZ80VE,It was a great product. Easy for children to follow. Recieved the product quickly after the order was placed. This important for me as I am in Australia.,1343606400,,153,4.5
5879816,2,B00DYZ80VE,"I thought that this would be better for the kids that what it actually was.  Kids have short attention spans & the video was actually quite boring, as it went back & forth, not constant on yoga.",1326844800,2,194,4.243243243243243

8599348,2,B00DYZ80VE,"This video is, well awful. I was looking for a good starter yoga video to do with my daughter. This is a video shot in the woods or a backyard or something and does a bunch of animal poses like a snake?! If you are looking for something with downward dog and a relaxing setting this isn't it. Maybe for boys more than girls? Seems very mediocre for what my expectation was.",1476748800,,373,4.194444444444445

8599350,1,B00DYZ80VE,The cover makes it seem like its for older kids. Its definitely not. Its for very young children. Its very corny..my 8 year old was embarrassed to even follow along with the tape. Id say this is more for 3 to 5 year olds.,1458259200,3,221,4.045454545454546

8599352,1,B00DYZ80VE,Not what I expected based on the case appearance. Was in reality more like an 80's yoga dvd. Very short.,1452470400,,104,4.25
8599353,4,B00DYZ80VE,"This is a cute and fun way to introduce kids to Yoga.  The sessions are too long for my 3 year old so he loses interest halfway through and stops.  My 5 year old really likes it.

Unfortunately the audio quality is horrible, we have to crank up the volume to almost max in order to understand what they are saying since there are no subtitles available.  That is the only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars.  Otherwise a good value for the price",1440115200,,446,4.1395348837209305
