7980506,5,B000089748,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

The tournament has begun. The heroes are facing the strongest enemies yet. Hiei must unleash a deadly attack to win, and Yusuke has to fight a master of drunken fighting in a knife edge death match.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1426,4.216117216117216
7980507,4,B000089748,"This DVD contains 4 episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho, uncut, in subs and dubs. If you are buying this, you probably have already seen a fair bit of YYH, and know that it has a clean visual style, and a focus on fighting and magic, with themes of honor and loyalty and perserverance. This DVD is no exception.
The episodes on this DVD cover the first round of the Dark Tournament, which Yusuke and his friends are forced to compete in. The stakes are absurdly high, as is the level of power needed for our heroes to win - so much so that you'll wonder what the show will do to top itself in the next however-many rounds of the tournament.
The pace is unhurried, but nothing like Dragonball Z's lazy meandering through fights. Rarely does a single fight exceed one episode, and often we get through two of them in a single half-hour.
This DVD has more screen time for Kuwabara's older sister, who smokes, drinks, and can take care of herself. More hints about the Mystery Fighter are dropped, also.
This DVD came with a sticker saying ""Ages 13 and up"", and that's as much for the language and a single obscene gesture as it is for the demon-decapitating violence.",1046995200,13,1154,4.44811320754717
