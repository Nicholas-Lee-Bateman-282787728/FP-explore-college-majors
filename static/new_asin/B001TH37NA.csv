8341263,4,B001TH37NA,"The first reviewer ""J. T."" did one fine job of reviewing Explore the World and why I will not go into great detail trying to convince others to add this beautiful travel DVD to their collection.  It is presented in a very attractive 5-disc folding jacket that describes the contents of each disc and then a quality, glossy brochure is included with the 5-disc folding jacket (box set) in a very attractive tin with the same color scene.  As the reviewer stated, this travel collection is not in HD and in some scenes it is quite evident but overall...it is a high quality travel series that is informative, interesting, and presented very well.  We are very pleased with Explore the World and will gladly add it to our collection of travel DVDs.",1363392000,6,745,4.628787878787879
8341264,4,B001TH37NA,"You are looking for a DVD documenting various Countries/Cities from all over the World ?? Then you found it ! Each episode provides a thrilling and informative introduction to an important place on the globe. Placing equal emphasis upon in-depth cultural history and breathtaking aerial cinematography, this series touches upon every inhabited continent--from Turkey to New Zealand. Along the way, you'll visit ancient ruins, marvel at natural phenomena, and discover the infinitely diverse ways that human beings have found to make themselves at home upon the Earth. I highly recommend this DVD Set. This is probably the best DVD that Madacy ever released. Each episode is full of fascinating information, the footages are stunning, this is really a great DVD to own. The reason why I'm giving this product 4 stars is because the footages are not in HD and sometimes it shows. But overall the quality is very good, I can't complain.

So this is a 5 disc set. Each disc features 5 cities/Countries, plus a short introduction. The segments are between 23 and 26 minutes long, for a total of more than 12 hours of interesting documentary. Here is the full listing, with the time for each segments. Enjoy !
