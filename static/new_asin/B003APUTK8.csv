8393120,5,B003APUTK8,"I have MS.  This is my second try with this video by Mr Baptiste.  The video is terrific. Mr Baptiste has obviously worked with MS people.  He is soft spoken and allows you to move at your own pace with or without support by holding on to something or doing the stretching sitting in a chair.  I have trouble with balance and strength.  I will continue to follow this video and his instructions for a while longer.  Hopefully I will get something out of it this time.  I gave up in frustration the last time I tried.  I now know that I set my expectations too high.  So, this time I will cool my jets and just do what I can do and take Mr Baptiste at his word...that my best IS good enough.",1475280000,,690,4.08955223880597

8393124,4,B003APUTK8,Very good exercise routine for those of us affected by MS.  Baron takes you thru some of the beginner yoga positions and I find it very beneficial to use every day to keep muscles toned and stay flexible.,1396656000,7,204,4.368421052631579
8393125,5,B003APUTK8,"I just did the yoga on this dvd and it is just like being in the class I go to (without the corrections my teacher makes).  But he does make corrections to people in the dvd class.  It is much better than I expected it to be, and I can finally do the tree pose with his recommendation to hold on to a chair if balance is an issue...which it really is!",1382054400,7,351,3.861111111111111
