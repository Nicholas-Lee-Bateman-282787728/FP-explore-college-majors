2772299,4,B000NNK4SC,"Pokemon All-Stars is a ten-disc DVD set that was released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Pokemon.  Each DVD features a Pokemon character, and the disc is supposed to include episodes that feature the Pokemon on the box.  On a couple of the discs, I wondered why an episode was included for a particular Pokemon.  One of the biggest examples of this was the inclusion of ""Fit to be Tide"" on the Squirtle disc.  While Ash may have used Squirtle for part of the gym battle, the episode actually focuses a lot more on Lampras (and would have been more appropriate for a Lampras disc if one had been made).

The ten Pokemon featured in the set are: Pikachu, Jigglypuff, Charizard, Squirtle, Blastoise, Eevee, Bulbasaur, Lugia, Charmander, and Mudkip.  The ten Pokemon that ended up being featured in the set were voted on by Pokemon fans.

Each disc only contains three episodes.  There are absolutely no special features.  This is a decent box set for someone wanting to acquire some episodes of the series in a relatively inexpensive manner.  However, for die-hard fans who want to acquire all of the episodes in the series are probably better off acquiring the DVD boxes of each season as they are released.",1203465600,27,1213,4.760765550239235
2772300,5,B000NNK4SC,"My son is Pokemon obsessed and has almost all the DVDs.  He was sick last week and we got him this boxed set as a special gift.  Even with 104 fever and hacking cough, we did not hear a complaint out of him all day.  It was the best medicine ever. I would have paid 100 times more than the list price to see that smile on his face.  He loved every single one of the 10 disks.",1201478400,10,375,3.769230769230769

8179377,5,B000NNK4SC,"I stumbled upon this fantastic series when I was 12 years old and I was a big fan of it during its golden years (1998-2003, I was 17 when the fad ended).  This show means so much to me as it brought back the magic of childhood.  Now I can relive those moments at any time I feel like it.  This box set contains many moments of adventure, friendship, peril, laughter, and battle.  Without further ado here are the episodes in chronological order:

Pokmon, I Choose You! - an Awesome start to the series as Ash gets off to a bad start.

Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village - Bulbasaur's capture (my first episode!)

Charmander, the stray Pokmon - Charmander's capture

Here come the Squirtle Squad - Squirtle's capture

Island of the Giant Pokmon - the only episode with subtitles when the Pokemon speak.

Snow Way Out! - Initially aired out of order, makes a good winter episode

Pikachu's Goodbye - One of the most emotional episodes ever in the franchise as Ash must decide whether to release Pikachu or not.

The Battling Eevee Brothers - all 1st Generation Eevee-lutions present in this action packed episode

March of the Exeggutor Squad - The last of the syndication episodes

The Song of Jigglypuff - one of the funnier episodes and the debut of Jigglypuff

Attack of the prehistoric Pokmon - a fan favorite with the evolution of Charizard!

Bulbasaur's mysterious garden - an episode that celebrates individualism

Beach Blankout Blastoise- Filler with the debut of Blastoise

The Pi-Kahuna- a very inspirational filler where Ash plays secondary

The Ancient Puzzle of Pokemopolis - scary episode with a giant Gengar and Alakazam!

Fit to be Tide- a gym episode where Ash tests out his new Lapras.

Charizard Chills - Charizard finally obeys Ash!

The Rivalry Revival - After losing to Gary, Ash and friends decide to go to Johto.

Charizard's Burning Ambitions - Another emotional roller coaster of an episode

Trouble's Brewing - a good Misty-centered episode full of action and laughter!

The Mystery is History - part one of the Lugia saga!

A parent Trapped! - part 2

A promise is a promise - last part of Lugia saga

Bulbasaur the Ambassador - Ash sends Bulbasaur to Oak's lab to settle some disputes

The Ties that Bind - part 1 of the best battle in the series: Ash vs Gary!

Can't Beat the heat! - part 2 can Charizard defeat Blastoise?

In the Knicker of Time - Worst episode in the collection

A Mudkip Mission - Brock captures a mudkip

Turning over a Nuzleaf - the pokemon get separated from their masters and meet some mischevious Nuzleaf

Judgment Day! - How refereeing is done.

This box set will always be one of my treasures.",1383955200,2,2648,4.670281995661605
