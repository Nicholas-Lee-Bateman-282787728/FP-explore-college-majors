7864838,5,6304203160,"This is a tragic tale ostensibly about a murder investigation but which extends way beyond it.
Cracker is a psychologist with the police department who seems to have a more general role than merely consulting in difficult to solve murders.
The show begins with a chase through the woods. Before too long the body of a young boy is discovered hanging from a tree. There are some twists and turns but the case boils down to one chief suspect who is an English teacher at the boy's school.
As the story develops we are drawn into a series of relationships which are intertwined with the murder investigation which both obscure and illuminate the story itself while at the same time providing insights into the operation of a police force.
Fitz...Cracker is shown to be good at his job with exceptional analytical skills and a tendency to occasionally draw the wrong conclusions. His personal life is a mess and he seems helpless to resolve it despite his professional skills. He is attracted to a younger police woman who reciprocates his feelings much to the chagrin of other male police officers who are also jealous of Cracker's role.
The family of the victim are also in a mess. Separated, the mother and the father display their different ways of coming to terms with the tragedy as well as their differing feelings towards their son whilst he was alive
Last, but not least, the nature of the suspect himself is laid bare and his feelings are subject to intense scrutiny. His failings are there for all to see and although he may be the murderer the viewer cannot help feeling both sorrow and pity for the man and his predicament.
Theis video certainly brings out a whole range of emotions throught this harrowing tale. Although the subject matter is grim there are some lighter moments but as a piece of drama this is first class.",1017792000,,1833,4.695652173913044
7864839,5,6304203160,"Cracker is intense, grim and absolutely brilliant.  The series is a character study of the individuals who commit heinous crimes and those who pursue them.  At the heart of the drama is Robbie Coltrane's ""Fitz.""  Fitz is a police psychologist who is a compulsive gambler and an alcoholic whose personal relationships are grimly dysfunctional.  Despite his obvious flaws Fitz is a compelling and driven character who is at his best when he has an opportunity to ""crack"" someone who might have committed a horrible crime.  Robbie Coltrane's Fitz is a neurotic jumble of psychologic insight, self-destructive impulses and Catholic guilt.  Coltrane portrays his profoundly flawed (yet oddly heroic) character with intensity and sympathy but without a hint of sentimentality.  Fantastic writing, insense ensemble acting and unrelenting plots set this series apart.  Extraordinary in every way.",1015804800,,888,5.525925925925926
