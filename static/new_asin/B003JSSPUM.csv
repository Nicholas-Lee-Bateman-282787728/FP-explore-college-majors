thanx to all who buy and sell on Amazon",1300060800,6,165,4.03030303030303
4131381,4,B003JSSPUM,"I do not know why Amazon did not take the time to at least list the movies on this DVD, but they didn't.
Even stranger is why didn't those who were selling them at least list the titles.

Anyways the 4 movies on this set are:

Just Cause
Altered States
Dead Calm
William Peter Blatty's The Ninth Configuration",1291939200,55,309,4.310344827586207
4131382,4,B003JSSPUM,"Even though Warner simply called this collection Cult Thrillers, it should really be called Mostly 80s Cult Thrillers. There's two true cult classics from 1980 (Altered States & The Ninth Configuration) and an international cult hit from 1989 (Dead Calm). If this set only had these three films, it would have been a perfect set. But somehow, Warner felt the need to toss the mid-90s thriller Just Cause into this set. I hadn't seen it before until I got this set, but judging from the reviews, this seemed average at best. And sure enough, they were right. It's not a bad film, but it's not very good either. It's not a bad way to kill a couple of hours, but compared to the other three films, it sticks out very badly.

I should say that I got this set because it had not only Altered States and Dead Calm, but it also had The Ninth Configuration as well. That film I had on its own, but it was selling in most places for at least $15. This set is selling for less than that, yet it also has these three other films. Of those, I really wanted to get Altered States, but every other release of that (including the Blu-Ray) is barebones and I don't really care for barebones releases anymore. So I sold my Ninth Configuration DVD and bought this. It was worth it. The quality is no different from the single DVD releases. As a matter of fact, they're exactly the same. So if you want these, but don't want them in separate barebones releases, this is worth the purchase.",1399507200,,1470,4.404411764705882
4131383,3,B003JSSPUM,"Dead Calm is surprisingly effective. Trapping three people at sea on a boat might be a recipe for stasis and audience boredom, but the actors--a very young Nicole Kidman, a very young and creepy Billy Zane, and Sam Neill--all generate suspense and credibility. Spectacular locations in the Barrier Reef combined with excellent cinematography all add up to an above-average thriller.

Altered States has a truly menacing score by John Corigliano, but the rest of the movie made little sense to me. DP Jordan Cronenweth went on to shoot Blade Runner. However, his prodigious talents seemed wasted on this project.

The Ninth Configuration. What can I say? Director William Peter Blatty made very good use of a castle that (if I remember correctly) he found somewhere in the American Northwest. Blatty also wrote the screenplay, which concerns a group of war veterans who may or may not be faking insanity to escape military duty. Blatty says the movie is about proving the existence of God. If he says so!

Just Cause has excellent actors all put to lousy use with a really dumb script. I've watched this movie a few times only because I enjoy watching good actors at work. But you'll see the plot twists at least an hour before they actually happen--and basic loopholes in plot logic will annoy you, too.",1393718400,,1303,4.86036036036036
4131384,4,B003JSSPUM,The price was right but these films are not remastered in any way and don't look as good as they should but you get what you pay for. I just wanted 'The Ninth Configuration' and didn't want to spend $40 so it will work.,1387152000,,219,4.0
4131385,4,B003JSSPUM,"All good if you really pay attention and consider the years each of them came out. Dead Calm was the weakest of the 4, but at least I finally found a Nicole Kidman movie that I liked. I have yet to see a decent movie she stars in. This was the first one that she got a 2 1/2 -- 3 from me...",1374364800,,290,3.619047619047619
4131386,4,B003JSSPUM,"I'm glad I invested in this interesting 4-pack. I love suspense thrillers, and I somehow managed to miss 3 of these when they were in theaters. I've seen Ken Russell's ALTERED STATES before, and it's a fascinatingly creepy sci-fi story as only Ken Russell could tell it, with the film dbut of William Hurt. The other 3 titles are also very good. DEAD CALM is very well directed by Philip Noyce (PATRIOT GAMES, etc.), and the 3 stars--Sam Neill, Billy Zane, and an incredibly pretty young unknown named Nicole Kidman--are excellent as a grieving couple on a sailing trip who save a stranded young man (Zane) from the water--with deadly results. JUST CAUSE is a solid serial killer story set in Florida's Everglades region, with Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne looking for the truth about a Death Row inmate. But the most interesting title here is THE NINTH CONFIGURATION from writer/director William Peter Blatty (THE EXORCIST). I won't spoil it by talking about the plot, but it has a great cast and it's set in a military psychiatric facility. It's scary, funny, and thought-provoking.

All in all, this 4-pack is one of the best DVD bargains I've found on Amazon. If you love good thrillers, you're in for a treat. Recommended.",1370649600,,1233,4.843601895734597
4131387,5,B003JSSPUM,"I wanted just the Ninth Configuration because it has long been a favorite dark comedy in my view.  All other dealers wanted ridiculoous prices for the movie by itself.  So I got the multiple set, saved money, and got three extra movies to boot.",1362528000,7,244,4.5227272727272725
4131388,5,B003JSSPUM,"I purchased this set to secure the hard to find ""Ninth Configuration"" written & directed by William Peter Blatty (author of the ""Exorcist"". Ninth was titled ""Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane"" when I first saw it as a young teenager when it was originally released. I had forgotten how funny the first half was but DID remember the powerful ending. Getting ""Altered States"" is a happy bonus!

Te duisc was inexpensive & arrived timely.",1353456000,8,429,4.876712328767123
4131389,4,B003JSSPUM,"***** My vote for the best DVD value on Amazon *****

Four great classic thrillers, good enough to own individually.
All movies are 2.4:1 aspect ratio,,except for Altered States which is 1.85:1
Movies are on just two disks, that alone is why 4 stars.

Nevertheless, get it now!!",1339804800,6,278,4.770833333333333
4131390,5,B003JSSPUM,"These are very watchable films.  Not headliners but good watching.  Ive read the reviews that call them rainy day movies which is ok.  They are good time passes.  I was moved, made to laugh, entralled with suspense so my emotions were given a workout.
The Ninth Configuration was witty, funny and had a under lying deep and meaningful theme too. Very comparable to MASH humour or Catch 22.

Dead calm was scary, challenging and heart warming.

Altered States took you down a road you were too scared to turn back on.  Science fiction you hope!

Just Cause a mind player extroadinaire.  In true Connery style this was no time passer but a rivettor to every moment.

Well worth seeing, very good value.",1338768000,10,700,4.663934426229508
4131391,5,B003JSSPUM,"I pretty much bought if for the Ninth Configuration, which if you haven't seen, is worth it!  The other movies are a bonus....not great, but not bad :)  I like these four movie packs....",1321315200,22,186,4.4411764705882355

8398484,3,B003JSSPUM,"The usual benefit of these 4 film sets is that you can find one movie that you wanted and get three more for free. Altered States is a true cult classic. Just Cause has Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne is worth a look. The Ninth Configuration is about mental health. But actually the best description is that it is closest to a movie version of the television show MASH for the 1970's. Three of these have known actors Nicole Kidman, Stacy Keach, Sam Neil, and Billy Zane and the fourth is Altered States. Altered States is a true look into one's self. It is a search for the meaning of life and an understanding of the life around us. The reason I rated this as Okay is because none of these movies really makes me want to see them again. They were alright once.",1408752000,,766,4.326388888888889

8398486,5,B003JSSPUM,"Purchased mainly for The Ninth Configuration, which is still excellent story telling. But having the other three films is a bonus at a cheaper price than trying to get them alone.",1404518400,,179,4.806451612903226
8398487,4,B003JSSPUM,The Ninth Configuration is Non-Anamorphic and the other Films are Anamorphic Widescreen. The other three look very good but Warner likes to use older disks for these value releases. Inside the case are two double sided disks with a Movie on each side. Just Cause was my main reason for buying this but I found Dead Calm to be very good also.,1402185600,2,341,4.516129032258065
