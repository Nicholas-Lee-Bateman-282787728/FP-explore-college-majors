885239,2,6304466145,"I saw this 1972 film as a child and just loved it (this was a year before my loyalty shifted to POSEIDON ADVENTURE). I remember even reading David Harper's novel (""Hijacked"") because this film made such an impression on me. Well, when I saw that it was finally being released on DVD I was a little insulted that it was being released by Warners as a ""Cult Camp Classic."" Well, Warners' is accurate in their labeling. My pre-teen memories of a great film was shattered by watching this low-budget disaster flick 35 years later.

While not the howler of hilarity that AIRPORT 79: THE CONCORD is, this flick barely has the production values above a TV-movie and boats some really terrible acting. I'm surprised James Brolin ever got another job after this attempt to out-twitch Anthony Perkins.

Don't get your hopes up just because its directed by John Guillermin. Sure, he's responible for TOWERING INFERNO and DEATH ON THE NILE, but he also directed SHAFT IN AFRICA, SHEENA QUEEN OF THE JUNGLE and the 1976 version of KING KONG. And this clunker is more like the latter three films.

Jeanne Crain is wasted in her final film. Also wasted intheir film debuts are Leslie Uggams (she's much better utilized in BLACK GIRL, also filmed in 1972) and  Susan Dey (so zombie-like that she seems to have lost all the natural charm she had on THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY). Rosie Grier obviously put all his efforts into the absurdly entertaining THE THING WITH TWO HEADS, that was filmed the same year.

The biggest laughs are from all the smoking that goes on in the cockpit. Every time Charlton Heston lights up his pipe, his co-pilot and navigator smirk as if there's some inside-joke. Its a wonder he can see the runway with all that smoke in the cockpit.",1181520000,4,1741,4.676470588235294
885240,5,6304466145,"This is one of my most favorite Charleton Heston films.  The suspense and drame, tied in with the few action scenes that are in the film really make this a must-see for any Heston fan.  Heston is perfectly cast as the  pilot, who is ready to go down fighting for his passengers and aircraft.  James Brolin, young, vibrant, and extremely unpredicable and intense as the flipped out Army Vet is absolutely convincing as the terribly misunderstood villian.  Check out the scene where Brolin uses his Green Beret karate tricks to take on Rosie Greer and some of the other ""Hero"" passengers.  It is one of the best moments in the film, when Brolin pulls out a grenade and yells out, "" Alright you hero's, come and get it!""  But of course in the end, it comes down to only two who must square off face to face in this wonderful suspence drame.  Supporting cast is great too.  Pick up your favorite beverage and pop some corn, sit back and enjoy!",1109894400,10,939,4.476470588235294
885241,3,6304466145,"Well, what do you know?  In 1972 Charlton Heston actually starred in a GOOD disaster movie, director John Guillerman's ""Skyjacked.""  Actually, ""Skyjacked"" is more of a suspense thriller than a disaster movie, with Heston giving a stellar performance as a dedicated pilot who is forced to lock wits with an insane, self-destructive Vietnam veteran-turned-hijacker (James Brolin) who wants to defect to the Soviet Union.  Thus, a domestic flight turns into a marathon trip to Moscow by way of Anchorage, with Heston's unflappable pilot using everything he has to keep his adversary calm long enough to save the lives of his passengers and crew.

Actually, in order to enjoy ""Skyjacked,"" one must remember it was made before the advent of metal detectors and other security devices, although the events of 9/11 certainly show how such a hijacking could take place even nowadays.  Adapted from a novel called ""Hijacked"" by Donald Harper, the film is expertly directed by Guillerman, who went on to cohelm ""The Towering Inferno"" and the 1976 flop remake of ""King Kong.""  He's in top form here, however, creating an admirable amount of suspense and guiding a good cast into vivid performances that transcend their stereotypical characters.  And for once the closed confines of a 727 are used to good effect, creating a sense of claustrophobia that rivals the final 30 minutes of the original ""Airport"" in generating suspense and a sense of dread.  And Brolin's live-wire character is an asset, since even though the film follows a fairly predictable path the viewer is never quite sure just how far he will go.

Guillerman's direction only falters during some badly-staged flashback sequences, in which head stewardess Yvette Mimieux remembers her courtship with ex-beau Heston.  These sequences actually consist of one of the biggest love story cliches of all time, namely Heston pushing a laughing Mimieux on a swing, which may provoke laughter instead of the romantic longing it is meant to convey.  But this is a small part of the film and a relatively minor flaw in an otherwise superior thriller.

The performances are excellent, especially Heston, who displays all the charisma and strength missing from his subsequent, rather embarassing genre performances.  He is matched by Brolin, who is so intense and high-strung he is almost unrecognizable.  It may be his finest screen hour.  Mimieux is strong as the tough stewardess, and Susan Dey (as a hippy), football star Roosevelt ""Rosie"" Grier (as a musician) and Walter Pidgeon (as a Senator) also register well.  But they are all sideline characters.  It is the mental duel between Heston and Brolin that is the entire show here, and they are both stellar, especially in the film's final segment, where they are left alone to face each other and the hostile Soviet army that has surrounded the plane upon its arrival in Moscow.

""Skyjacked"" is a stellar film for genre addicts, although best for those who prefer suspense over hard action and thrills.  Unfortunately, it is unavailable on DVD and the VHS version is in pan-and-scan, which is a detriment considering the film was shot in panavision 2:35:1 and loses much in its chopped-up television prints.  My advice is to hold out for a widescreen DVD.  Otherwise, buyer beware.  **** (out of *****) for the film only, not the VHS which rates * (out of *****)

A note:  ""Skyjacked"" was idiotically renamed ""Sky Terror"" for its television showings and may still be known as such in some cable listings.  But they are the same movie.",1093996800,5,3535,5.02229845626072
885242,4,6304466145,"The word ""hijack"" hadn't been in the American lexion too long in 1972 when this Charleton Heston suspense drama was released. As a commercial pilot, Heston and his 747 are commandeered by a dishonorably discharged and psychotic military veteran (James Brolin in a convincing dastardly turn). Dissolusioned with his American service and seeing himself as a failure in his parents' view, Brolin's character intends to take the jetliner and some of its star-studded passengers to Russia where, in his schizophrenic frame of mind, he will get there the just he thinks he is due. ""Skyjacked"" distinguishes itself from the onslaught of disaster films that accentuated the '70s in that it is neither a disaster flick nor reliant on special effects. Heston is, as expected, terrific as the captain who doesn't lose sight of his primary function: to keep his passengers alive. Among them are football player-turned actor Rosey Grier; character actresses Yvette Mimeux (the lead flight attendant and, in a soap opera subplot, the ""other woman"" in Heston's life), a very pregnant Mariette Harley, and Leslie Uggams as another flight attendant; the late Walter Pidgeon as a U.S. senator; and Susan Dey (""The Partridge Family,"" ""LA Law"") and Nicholas Hammond (""The Sound of Music"" and TV's ""Spiderman"" in the late '70s) as first-time acquaintances in youthful love. As the off-center hijacker, Brolin gives a bravo performance that makes his fate at film's end very, very satisfying. In sum, ""Skyjacked"" is worth its salt, and its suspense makes it a worthy flight.",1046390400,40,1552,5.187250996015936
885243,4,6304466145,"There are no splashy special effects at work in 1972's ""Skyjacked"" (a.k.a.: ""Sky Terror""), just a lot of tension on board a Boeing 707 jetliner that has been ""skyjacked"" to Russia.  James Brolin is quite convincing as the bad guy who diverts the plane to Moscow.  And Charlton Heston is, as always, first-rate as the aircraft's Captain (similar to roles he would play in later years in ""Airport 1975"" and ""A Thousand Heroes"").  I ask you:  Who wouldn't want Charlton Heston as their airline Captain?!  A no-brainer!

The action is, at times, a bit on the slow side.  But, overall, it delivers the goods. Best scene (IMO): Heston has to make a ""zero-zero"" landing after being diverted to Anchorage International Airport (before the plane continues on to Moscow).  The plane is being ""talked in"" by air-traffic controller Claude Akins.  The tension is temporarily relieved as Heston puts the plane down perfectly in the blinding rain.  This scene follows another good one, where Heston must maneuver his Boeing 707 violently, in order to avoid a small aircraft in the same airspace. This is a good picture for an airplane lover.",1007337600,6,1126,4.91005291005291
885244,5,6304466145,"As a builder of model airplanes and an aviation buff I found the movie ""Skyjacked"" very realiastic and very well portrayed by two of the very best actors such as James Brolin who played the hijacker-a discontented and disheartened U.S. Army Sergeant. Naturally, both actors played their roles to perfection. Now as far as the movie itself is concerned, well, let me say that it showed the way in which our soldiers were treated when they returned from Vietnam: Whcih was very bad and downright cruel! And what James Brolin did in the movie was to send a message to society by showing them that soldiers have feelings too. Now I do not condone hijackings of a ny sort; much less killing innocent people, but the movie in and by itself did deliver a very powerful message.",1005091200,,770,4.627737226277373
885245,4,6304466145,"Even a trusted Hollywood icon like Charlton Heston isn't safe from a certain amount of terror.  He plays the pilot at the controls of this 1972 suspense drama, one of the many disaster films (or ""multi-jeopardy"" films, as Heston liked to call them) made during the 1970s.  James Brolin is excellent as the seemingly all-American army man who orders Heston's plane to be flown into Russia.  John Guillermin's direction is pretty good, and there isn't all that much melodrama like we see in many other such movies.  The film was actually banned in Australia because the government there was afraid it would encourage copycat incidents.  Nothing of the sort happened, and the film became another huge hit for Heston in his post-epic days.",996278400,5,735,4.943089430894309

SKYJACKED (1972) isn't the most celebrated representative of its genre. Chances are you haven't even heard of it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poseidon-Adventure/dp/B000EHSVNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poseidon Adventure</a>&nbsp;(1972),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Towering-Inferno-Special-Edition/dp/B000EHSVOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Towering Inferno (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(1974),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B007SPPANM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>&nbsp;(1997),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>&nbsp;(1998) and who knows how many other disaster flicks all have more shine, all got more ink. But I guess it's watchable enough, and I say ""I guess"" because there were slow scenes that I really wanted to fast-forward thru. More frequently, with this type of movie, the disaster is triggered by the vagaries of some uncaring, impersonal force of nature. For SKYJACKED, though, it's man and his assshattery that causes a kerfuff1e.

A Minneapolis-bound Boeing 707 jet airliner, designated Global 502, is the ill-fated loci. Its crew gets its first worrisome inkling when a passenger reports an ominous lipstick message scrawled on the mirror of the rest room in first class. It spells instructions and a warning: that if Global 502 doesn't divert to Anchorage, Alaska (and, later, to Moscow), a hidden time bomb will detonate. So, now, let's watch the calm and collected Captain Henry O'Hara (Charlton Heston), the icy head stewardess Angela Thacher (Yvette Mimieux), and their staff try to keep it professional as they scramble to determine if the threat is genuine or a hoax.

Soap opera is always part and parcel of disaster cinema, and, yep, the melodrama runs deep and florid with this mix of flight crew and passengers. Back in the day, this was considered something of an all-star ensemble, a who's who of 1970's pop culture. The really cute, mouthy hippie girl (Susan Dey, PARTRIDGE FAMILY) kicks off the core storyline. And is that dignified senator (Walter Pidgeon) involved somehow? Others on the roster include a hep jazz cellist (mellow cat and football legend Rosey Grier), a merry, drinky-poo Vietnam vet (James Brolin), and a woman (Mariette Hartley) so very pregnant she perhaps ought not to be flying at all. The moment the camera pans to Hartley, all swolled up, your first reaction is probably the same as mine: ""Oh, yeah, she's poppin' that baby out in mid-flight."" Of course, the most sordid distraction is that Captain O'Hara and his head stewardess happen to be ex-lovers. So they have issues to work out.

SKYJACKED, let's say 80% of it, is solid escapist fare. I didn't mind the bits where the film takes on this surreal, paranoid vibe, thanks to several flashback peeks into the bomber's mind. They were weird but sort of interesting. But I couldn't take the romantic flashbacks seriously - I kept thinking that these scenes are what AIRPLANE was parodying with ITS romantic flashbacks. For me, there were times when the soap opera side stories did take momentum away from the thriller aspect.

But a series of action moments picks up the slack. I really liked that harrowing forced landing in Anchorage as the commercial airliner is battered by inclement weather. This is when Claude Akins (m'man Sheriff Lobo) makes his terrific cameo as the Air Force expert in the control tower who attempts to talk Global 502 down to safe landing. Of course, the cat-and-mouse games between Captain O'Hara and the twitchy bomber make for good, suspenseful stuff. So who lives? Who dies? Who gives birth? Who gets to slide down that inflatable evacuation slide? Charlton Heston would go on to make superior disaster flicks, but there's something to be said for this one, even encumbered as it were by flaws in pacing and by the blandness of its soap opera trappings. There's always something compelling about professional people exhibiting grace under fire, and the crew of Global 502 does that. Besides, it's a nostalgic look back into a bygone era when the Red Scare was a very real thing and pilots could smoke in the cockpit.

If you've got the extra pesos, I recommend that you instead get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Film-Favorites-Charleton-Heston-Mother-Lode-The-Omega-Man-Skyjacked-Soylent-Green/dp/B0050MB5N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Film Favorites: Charleton Heston (Mother Lode, The Omega Man, Skyjacked, Soylent Green)</a>, which also has SKYJACKED but also one of Heston's best films and two other ones.",1402012800,,4948,5.991513437057992
885390,4,6304466145,"If it has been a while since you last saw an airplane disaster movie, this one will show you how they were done back in their heyday. Neither among the best nor the worst, it is fairly typical, with the virtue of including some one-time Big Names and an assortment of lesser names in the cast. One favorite is Jeanne Crain making her second from last film. While she might have gotten more plaudits for some of the others, I will always remember her in State Fair and An Apartment for Peggy (even after the blow of learning she did not sing in the former nor in any other of her singing roles). No one was bigger on the lot in the early 40's than Walter Pidgeon, who graduated from Nick Carter to, among others, Mrs. Miniver. We see him here as a Senator who has been invited  for a yacht voyage by the President. There are others, including minor stars of the future, but the man whocarries the film, of course, is Charlton Heston, here playing the Captain of the AirLiner threatened by a bomber. It is not a place for his more grandiose biblical style and he handles his role with suitable constraint. Not everyone else is restrained, but that is clearly the fault of the Director.
As I say, it is no threat to make any list of the top 500 films in Hollywood History, but it is a good workmanlike job which is entertaining if you are in the mood for a hijacking, 1972 style",1390003200,,1375,4.308880308880309

Yes Skyjacked. You NEVER see it on TV for obvious reasons. Charlton Heston headlines an all star cast of character actors not superstars. So it's NOT Airport but it's pretty darn good. Not Great.

885487,2,6304466145,"All huge fan of Charlton Heston as I am, I was nevertheless disappointed by this 1972 film about hijacking of a passenger plane.

Charlton Heston plays here Captain Henry ""Hank"" O'Hara, a former US Air Force colonel, who now works as civilian pilot. Although very respected for his professional abilities, he is also shown as a less than perfect man, as he once had a long extra-marital affair with a gorgeous flight attendant, Angela (Yvette Mimieux) but finally dumped her rather brutally to come back to his wife. And now, suddenly, not only Angela is affected to his plane as chief flight attendant but also her fiance is the second pilot on the flight... All three try to ignore the elephant in the middle of the room and this tension between them is one of the best parts of the film... Then, soon after take off, there is a bomb alert and the plane is forced to go to a completely unexpected location. After which the film begins for real.

I found the whole scenario weak. There is initially a mystery but it is revealed too soon. The villain is so stereotypic that his rants made me simply yawn. And the ending is poor, very poor indeed.

I would give this film one star only, if it was not for Yvette Mimieux, who saves it a little. Her great beauty was always an asset in all films in which she appeared, like Oscar winning ""Time machine"", the torrid ""Diamond Head"" or the extremely violent ""Dark of the sun"". But in this film, her calm dignity of a woman wronged but who recovered nicely and rebuild her life makes an even bigger impression. The fact that this dignity is also wrapped in a gorgeous uniform certainly doesn't hurt... After seeing her in this film I understood better how she became later in her life a succesful businesswomen and got rich by dealing in real estate (she also got a college degree in anthropology, just for fun).

So, bottom line, I think that this film is only for the most hardened Charlton Heston or Yvette Mimieux fans - for anybody else, this film will be probably just a loss of time.",1349049600,,2033,4.5013550135501355

885491,5,6304466145,"Skyjacked is a somewhat dated film; but it remains suspenseful nonetheless. The plot flows rather well despite a few characters that are stereotypical for the time; but on the other hand the cinematography and the choreography are not that bad at all. The musical score enhances the suspense and it's terrific to see Charlton Heston and the rest of the cast act convincingly.

When the action starts, we meet World Airways Flight Captain Capt. Henry 'Hank' O'Hara (Charlton Heston) who has to deal with his old flame, a stewardess named Angela Thacher (Yvette Mimieux) on a flight along with stewardess Lovejoy Wells (Leslie Uggams) and a few others. Of course, there are the `70s stereotypical characters onboard: a Sergeant (James Brolin) trying to make his sister's wedding just in time; Gary Brown, a jazz cellist (Roosevelt Grier); a very pregnant woman (Jeanne Crain) as Mrs. Clara Shaw; US Senator Arne Lindner (Walter Pidgeon) with his son Peter (Nicholas Hammond) and young hippie Elly Brewster (Susan Dey), just to name a few.

However, it isn't long before it's very well known that a hijacker is onboard; and this did happen from time to time back in the day when airport security didn't really exist. (This plot would not be terribly convincing at this time.) Written messages in red lipstick from the hijacker demand that the plane be re-routed to Anchorage; and Captain O'Hara, not wishing to take any chances and wanting his crew and passengers safe, sets course for Anchorage as they land in a zero visibility storm that is suspenseful indeed--but of course you get the feeling that this is far from the end of the plot as the film is only half-over!

We discover that Jerome K. Weber (James Brolin), a military officer headed for a mental health/rehab center, is the hijacker--and although Jerome lets most of the passengers off the plane in Alaska, he simultaneously insists that the rest of them--including the Senator and his son, Elly, the jazz cellist and one or two more-- must now fly on with him and a few of the flight crew to Moscow. Sergeant Weber has the delusion that he will be rewarded by then-Soviet officials and leaders in Moscow and be a true military hero in the former Soviet Union.

But what happens from here on in won't be in this review--I don't want to spoil it for you! I wish the DVD had a few extras but it doesn't.

Skyjacked, although dated, is an entertaining suspense movie even if you do figure what may well happen by the end.

885561,4,6304466145,"I hadn't seen Skyjacked in years but I saw some bits on youtube and decided to take a chance. To my surprise, because sometimes movies are better in memory than present, this was very good. There's a much leaner plot than the bloated Airport movies, where every passenger had a life story to share. In fact, some of this almost feels like a TV movie, probably because so many small screen stars were onboard. Claude Akins and John Hillerman are (brief) air traffic controllers (Akins seems to be channelling Joe Patroni in the tower). Yvette Mimieux, in a ton of TV movies at this time, is the head stewardess. Susan Dey, in a really bad performance, was around Partridge time. Then there's veteran character actor Ken Swofford as the flight engineer, Rosey Grier as a jazz cellist (he's actually pretty good in this), Mariette Hartley as a very pregnant passenger (yeah, cliched)and Leslie Uggams as a feisty flight attendant. Walter Pidgeon is an elderly US Senator and Nichlos Hammond is his son, both unmemorable but to be fair, there's not much in the script for them. And in a performance that demonstrates graphically why he is now a purse carrier and actor in bad political movies financed by you know who, James Brolin is the mad bomber, so to speak. Brolin is astonishingly bad and over the top, even for a crazy hijacker.

So, you ask, what saves this movie? The megapresence of Charlton Heston of course. This is Heston's first entry into the 70s disaster field and by far his best. This is much better than Airport 75 or Earthquake or any other nonsense that followed. Heston's pilot Hank O'Hara is a decent, good man who is determined not to have anyone die on his plane and he is tough enough to back it up without bluster or bombast. In fact, Heston is rather understated in this performance and it's quite effective, especially as Brolin chews scenery.

As others have noted, this is more of a suspense movie than an action ride. Although not without faults, (the Heston/Mimieux subplot is a been there, done that waste of time) I rather liked my foray into the past. Much better than nearly all the movies nowdays.",1280793600,4,2132,4.682666666666667
885562,4,6304466145,"This film was released in 1972, I have never seen it until 2010, after discovering segments loaded into You tube. While it follows along the genre of aircraft/sky disaster,action films, it has numerous faults which caused a low box office financial yield. Created after the success Airport 1970, the two cannot have any side by side comparison. Yes in 1972, words like Terrorism and Hijacking were new and security at airports didn't exist ,allowing this type of incident to occur. While Charlton Heston was one of the more famous actors of the time, this script was weak and not as well constructed as Airport. Several noticable goofs in of the film were - 1) the aircraft, a Boeing 707,appropriate for the time era as well as the in flight photography were quite good, however it is noted that many course correction actions were sudden and violent, which in reality would throw passengers about ,if it were a real flight. 2) the terrorist, Brolin cast as a military figure who served in Vietnam had several weapon inaccuracies. The U.S. military does not use what appeared to be a luger 9 MM pistol and a 9 MM sub machine gun, the only accurate items were the ""pineapple"" grenades. 3) the flashback sequences were added to waste film. 4) Yvette Mimeux is constantly cast as the woman caught between two lovers, you can see a similar charcter of her in the film, ""Disaster on the Coastliner"" with William Shatner. 5) Numerous inaccuracies occured with regard to the entry into Restricted Russian Airspace and landing in Moscow, first the 4 fighter jets weren't Soviet made MIGS but the paint scheme made up for that, as well as ,Russian air defense would do more than buzz a plane at supersonic speeds ,just to upset them. 6) Landing on the barren runway stretch, called Moscow airport,was bit hard to believe a major airport would be so deserted. 7) when the plane landed ,all airport vehicles were current U.S. made cars and trucks including the military vehicles. 8) A close up on several Russian soldiers shows they were armed with M-16's,the Russians always used AK-47's. While no film can be 100 % accurate ,at the least minor details should appear so and finally after his attempt to be a hero,why would anyone want to risk being killed over an aircraft? 9) Heston gets his trademark end of screen credit, being carried off on a stretcher, after being mortally wounded or killed, this can be seen in the films, ""Soylent Green"" & ""The Omega Man"", besides Airport 1975, does he ever end a film standing on his feet? This film is mild entertainment provided one has not seen the more modern films involving hijacking and terrorism at airports and on aircraft.",1280620800,,2665,4.758099352051836

885564,4,6304466145,"Though not totally accurate in the flight shots, this movie does provide some truly interesting and beautiful scenes of a Boeing 707 (the beautiful jet aircraft that really put the phrase ""jet age"" in our vocabulary) in flight.  The acting is good and takes the viewer back to an age when flying was a pleasure and blundering nuisances like the TSA checks at today's airports didn't exist.",1239494400,,389,4.8059701492537314
885565,3,6304466145,"Having bestrode the epic genre like a colossus in the 50s and 60s, Charlton Heston made a pretty good stab at being the go-to-guy for disaster movies in the 70s with Earthquake, Airport 1975 and Gray Lady Down, with this 1972 hijacking thriller acting as something of a warmup for him. It ticks most of the genre boxes - a cast of fading stars, high-concept premise - but is more interested in avoiding disaster than revelling in it as Chuck's pipe-smoking pilot (""Nobody dies on my airplane!"") discovers there's a mad bomber on board and since Van Heflin isn't on the passenger list it could be anyone in First Class. Unfortunately, while the film gets some good mileage over concealing the hijacker's identity, the DVD sleeve and menu give it away, but since this is from the days when the worst most hijackers wanted was to fly to a communist country, after a well executed storm landing, most of the film is taken up with his attempts to outwit the crazy Vietnam vet who wants to hijack his plane to take him to Russia. Well, it makes a change from Cuba....

The cast are more familiar than famous - Yvette Mimieux, Walter Pidgeon, James Brolin, Susan Dey and a pregnant Mariette Hartley (less than flatteringly photographed, but no-one looks good giving birth even in First Class) are the closest to V.I.P.s on this flight - but it's directed with John Guillermin's customary professionalism, and while the script and characters were clichd even in 1972 it's a lot better than you might expect, even showcasing some impressive aerial footage that forsakes models for the real thing. No worldbeater, but certainly better than average timefiller that's rather better than its inclusion as part of Warners' Cult Camp Classics Collection might lead you to believe (indeed, the only real moments of unintentional camp are the odd flashback). No extras, but a decent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",1232755200,3,1893,4.87888198757764
885566,3,6304466145,"My childhood recollection of ""Skyjacked"" is that it was an awesome thriller.
My adult re-visit is that it BLOWS. Hilariously so.
Seriously, the plot is SO hackneyed that the romantic dream sequence...or should I say, the FIRST romantic dream sequence of, yes, two...arrives with a fade-in to a soft-focus dreamy meadow...which they thought was SO cool they do it again later, and use it as a plot twist.
Oh dear God...the overacting is the only thing I'd describe as 'awesome' now, and it truly is.
James Brolin was clearly channelling his inner Norman Bates; I'm a sucker for any Stentorian Heston roles (are there any other?) so that, for me, is a plus.
It's not really a ""thriller"" anymore, but it's a fun trip back in time.
But you'll wince a few times before the credits roll...",1217548800,2,783,4.7226277372262775
885567,1,6304466145,"This movie is a total waste of time- except maybe for the sequences showing the 707 in flight- still a beautiful airplane.

The plot is contrived, and stupid.  Charleton Heston is his usual overacting self- and most all the other actors seem to be just going through the motions.  Roosevelt Greer was attempting to build a career as an actor at the time, and you can clearly see why he's not acting now.  James Brolin's performance as the hijacker is embarassing to watch, particularly when he starts to look like a wild-eyed lunatic.

One of my favorite parts of this movie is when the Soviet fighters (North American F-100 Super Sabers)intercept the airliner in Alaska and then proceed to escort it ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SOVIET UNION to Moscow.

One particularly hilarious thing is where they dub a deeper voice for John Fiedler (the mousey guy who always played a dormat.)  Apparently his real voice was too high pitched.  However, his character is so minor in the movie that they could have cast anyone.",1208131200,4,1008,4.72

They used a real passenger airliner and filmed it flying rather than special effects and the realism helps the film over the hump from average to better than average. Also Chuck Heston and James Brolin are superb and make the film feel plausible. In this day and age of police aggressiveness, I think Brolin's character would have been taken out by a sniper at the Anchorage airport but apparently not back then. Other than that, most of of the action seems realistic and it is always fun to see how things were in the not so distant past vs today. I got this as part of the 4 movie set from Warner Brothers. At $2.50 a movie, it was a great bargain.",1430611200,,681,4.3700787401574805
