8166316,5,6301651707,"this movie is fantastic, it is great to see a leading lady that is curvy  like most of us girls,  and she has intimate relations, because  most movies with curvy women tend to mock them and not treat them as real leading ladies, or  there to be the leading ladys best friend, marrianne is a wonderful german actress. ;",1408579200,,318,4.338983050847458
8166317,5,6301651707,This is my all time favourite movie.  It is not available in DVD and I do not have a VCR so I can't actually watch the video cassette but I have since discovered that the movie is on YouTube so I can watch it whenever I want.  But I'm glad that I bought the video cassette copy because one day I will have a device that enables me to watch it.,1405209600,,343,3.816901408450704
8166318,5,6301651707,"This is a very memorable film.  Cunning, humor, and pathos brought forth by a stunning (understated) performance by Ms. ""S"" with an ""Alone Again, Naturally"" ending that is very thought provoking.  The BEST of all her movies I have seen (X3).",1359676800,,241,4.853658536585366

Thanks So Much,

8166320,5,6301651707,"well acted .  I became totally absorbed by the less-than-likely scenario and chuckled and laughed through most of the film..  As cameron mannheim stated at the Emmys, ""This one is for the fat girls !"". grab some buttered popcorn and curl up on the divan.",1262822400,2,254,4.622222222222222
8166321,5,6301651707,"Marianne Sagebrecht, best known as the zaftig star of Bagdad Cafe and Rosalie Goes Shopping stars as a frumpy corpse-dresser who is very serious about her job...and about the good-looking subway-station caller she sees every day.  She starts her own transformation of sorts and sets out to win him.  Percy Adler directs this as well as the other two movies listed above. It's charming and surprising.
