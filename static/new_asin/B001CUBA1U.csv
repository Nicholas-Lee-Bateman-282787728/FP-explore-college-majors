8289815,5,B001CUBA1U,"Part of the History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series, this DVD focuses on an iconic American legend - the Jeep. The DVD is 50 minutes long and is filled with period footage as well as footage of restored models and good narration.

The video begins with the creation of the Jeep as an attempt by American Bantam, one of those small car companies that existed before WWII, to get a lucrative gov't contract to save their company. They responded to the gov't specification for a small personnel carrier that was lightweight and had four-wheel-drive. American Bantam employees worked without pay to create the prototype and further examples, hoping to save their company and their jobs.

They produced the ""Blitz Buggy"" that would later become what we know as the Jeep. Since they created a vehicle under gov't specs, the design belonged to the gov't, not American Bantam. They shared all the designs with Willys Overland which took the design and added their more powerful engine and won the contract. Although Ford got a cut of the eventual contract, American Bantam was shut out of the production of the Jeep and eventually folded.

After WWII, Willys continued to build and market the Jeep, this time to civilians that had driven the all-terrain vehicle in the service. The Jeep continued to be popular for decades, even though attempts to widen the product line with the Jeepster were deemed failures. The DVD did a good job of showing all the companies that ended up owning Jeep after WWII, ending with Chrysler. The DVD also showed Jeep as the creator of what we now call the SUV with the Waggoneer and the Cherokee.

This is a good video showing the history of the Jeep as a vehicle and as a company as well as showing the effect the little 4X4 had on the market of today. I recommend this DVD with five stars.",1394928000,,1813,4.709779179810726
