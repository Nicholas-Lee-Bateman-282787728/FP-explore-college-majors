8333240,1,B001PF5D6U,"Got this to show to third graders as part of a novel study about a family in Paris - waaay too much emphasis on nude art, close ups of the genitalia, and the Paris red light district. So not appropriate.",1414195200,,203,4.1
8333241,1,B001PF5D6U,"Simply disappointing . The quality of the image its bad and if one has a widescreen TV and HD its even worse, I do not recommend this. I bought this DVD only because its narrated in Spanish which its very hard to find, and I was not lucky, Ive bought in Amazon before, DVD of Cities of The World of Rome, Tokyo, Moscow and other places and these ones had good image quality and they are widescreen but they were narrated in English. I would like to find DVDs or Blue Rays of journeys to parts of the world but with the same quality as the one of  Cities of the world, but narrated in spanish.",1361577600,,592,4.103448275862069
8333242,5,B001PF5D6U,Smooth transaction.  Great DVD...includes all of the landmarks.  Great for remembering what you saw or will see.  By far the best I've seen on Paris.,1322179200,2,149,4.88
8333243,3,B001PF5D6U,Nice video - but a bit dated and did not show all of the sights.,1267401600,8,64,3.3333333333333335
