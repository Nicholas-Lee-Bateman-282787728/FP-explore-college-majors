8002825,2,B0000TSQM0,"If you want to see Hudson Leick topless, Something About Sex has a better scene for that & it's a decent overall movie though she only has a bit part in it.  She has a larger role in this movie but it still doesn't save the movie from mediocrity.  Combined with elements of rape & drug use, I just found it hard to enjoy.",1275177600,,321,4.0

and looks great.",1261612800,2,130,3.814814814814815
8002827,1,B0000TSQM0,"An old gambler, Benny Walsh (Frank Gorshin), has a big night in a private poker game and is murdered on the drive home.  His son arrives in the small Nevada town nosing around for his father's last will and an explanation to a death the authorities are calling an accident.

  None of the actors are all that appealing in THE LAST HAND, but they're vaguely recognizable from television series and small roles in other movies.  The plot has more holes than a wheel of Swiss cheese. Worst, the clever `gags' seriously misfire (If character A is going to kill character B, character A should not truss B up and depart to let nature take its course, especially when A leaves a sharp jackknife just within reach.  In the case of this movie, B shouldn't leave A in the same situation.  In another case, there's really no reason to wear an oversized Halloween mask when sniping at an car driving down a deserted stretch of highway, nor is the cause of the car's explosion clear.  Since everybody in the audience and the movie knows that Benny was killed by an acquaintance there was no reason to play coy with the killer's identity. )  THE LAST HAND is a rental, at best.",1091232000,3,1164,4.504761904761905
