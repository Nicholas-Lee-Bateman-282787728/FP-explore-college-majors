8440215,4,B004STBF9E,"Blu Ray - 3/5: The Blu Ray comes with some ceremony thing and behind the scenes thing. The picture quality is 95% watchable. The other 5%; there is a scene which the picture is blurry and annoying and another which reveals a vertical black line. But overall, it's cool. And no, the magic of Blu Ray didn't fix the picture quality to YOUR standards of HD stupidity.

Movie - 4/5: Jet Li plays a sissy hit man who is trying earn money to cater to his mama but always comes up short because he doesn't want to kill anyone. He befriends a fat ugly con artist in which both get involved in a ""revenge fund"" after the assassination of a Japanese Yakuza boss by a top hit man called ""The King Of Killers"". And yaddi-yadda. The movie has some nice action and a descent story but loses points for some lousy comedy and light-hearted dramatization. I felt the movie should of been more so dark (it has its dark moments but not enough) and so forth but overall I liked it well enough.",1483401600,,973,4.316939890710382
