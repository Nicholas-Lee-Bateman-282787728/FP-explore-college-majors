8328041,1,B001NXC01A,"If you want to watch ballet, then watch a performance. I thought that seeing a rehearsal may be interesting and/or educational, but there is nothing going on here that would not be better seen at a performance. There are no insights to be had, no words to be heard... Did I mention that it's also very short? Just watch an actual Swan Lake.",1368144000,,340,4.412698412698413
8328042,5,B001NXC01A,"The Real Thing

The real thing. If you went to Russia and endured all the rigmarole required to travel there, you still could not see what is on display here... The stars of the Russian State Theatre of the City of Nizhny Novgorod attired in costume in an actual rehearsal. This is a unique opportunity the producer of this video series was able to arrange. You will not see it elsewhere. If all you want is to be entertained... buy a DVD of the latest movie. If you want to see real artists, move through time displacing space at the highest artistic level ... buy this DVD",1234310400,,574,4.364485981308412
8328043,5,B001NXC01A,Beautiful dancers and the best in the world Russian ballet school lines and movements.  40 minutes of wonderful and instructive experience. Very enjoyable to watch this world class ballet rehearsal.  Very pleased.,1232323200,2,213,5.625
8328044,5,B001NXC01A,This video presents one of the best Russian State Ballet Theatre with it principals who rehears Swan Lake ballet pieces. Video designed to watch grace and beauty of dancers and enjoy it. There is no instructions as moves of dancers are so precise and complete that it makes this video very special.,1231632000,,298,4.75
8328045,1,B001NXC01A,"This home-movie issue is neither worth the twenty minutes of watching nor the $24.95 cost.  There is nothing to be learned as the dancers do the Swan Lake Act I pas de deux a couple of times with little or no correction, other than that given in Russian, which is of no use to non-Russian speakers. If this video is supposed to be semi-instructional and entertaining, it fails.",1231545600,5,377,4.544117647058823
