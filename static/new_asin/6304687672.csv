7876038,5,6304687672,This was a decent movie. You'll definitely like it if you are into fast cars. There were some funny parts of the movie as well. I highly recommend this movie to any Michael Madsen fan. The girls looked great as well! :),1256688000,,219,4.238095238095238
7876039,4,6304687672,"Why Roy Scheider plays a part in a movie like this I really don't know, but it elevates Executive Target just a little bit above your everyday action movie. It does not really have much of a plot. ( Former stunt driver  has his wife kidnapped and must help kidnap the president to get her  released, how unlikely can you get ) but Michael Madson as the frantic  driver makes tme most of the part and Scheider as the president is quite  believable. The action scenes, especially the car-chases are really good  and the movie is short enough that you don't get bored from the lack of  story and dialogue. Nothing special, but good for an evening of fun.",951091200,7,651,4.428571428571429
7876040,4,6304687672,"I didn't expect to find one of the best ever car chases is a straight-to-video, (I don't know about the rest of the world, but in Australia, this went straight-to-video) but Executive Target proved me  wrong. The presence of the ever-cool Madsen also makes this movie a winner.  To sum it up, its vertually a movie version of the playstation game  ""DRIVER"".",943574400,3,357,4.725806451612903
