5846772,5,B00DPU26GI,"I bought this strictly for Brainscan, and while I expected to see all four films crammed onto one desk, that was not the case. This set contains four discs with the full versions of each release.",1422403200,8,195,4.444444444444445
5846773,5,B00DPU26GI,I mainly bought this for the movie Brain scan. I've enjoyed all the movies. They are in perfect condition.,1421712000,2,106,4.631578947368421
5846774,4,B00DPU26GI,"I picked this up mainly for the widescreen dvd version of ""BRAINSCAN"", certainly a good classic film to me.
Fright Night = obvious classic!
The Craft & Monster High are a little weak but both worth one view.
  Overall, worth getting for Brainscan and if you don't have Fright Night already. Those two are very good films VERY :)",1405728000,4,328,4.5423728813559325

5846792,5,B00DPU26GI,"The only movie in this collection I didn't care for was Monster High - I only watched about fifteen minutes of it before I couldn't stand it anymore. It's the sort of movie that would have a lot of appeal to adolescent males (no offense). The Craft is a good movie - of it's era - I was a teenager when this movie came out and I really connected with the characters and loved the story. Brainscan was a lot better than I remembered it. It kind of reminds me of the Michael Douglas movie, the Game. Fright Night was fun for a campy horror movie evening - Chris Sarandon is so amazing as a vampire - he has great presence.",1453334400,6,620,4.132231404958677
5846793,5,B00DPU26GI,Good collection but  Monster high is terrible!!!,1451433600,2,48,5.857142857142857
5846794,5,B00DPU26GI,Fast shipping and exactly as described.,1443139200,,39,5.666666666666667
5846795,5,B00DPU26GI,Brainscan is one of my favorite horror movies now i got this set for that film because Amazon wants 40 new for it and i paid 9 dollars in the set Plus you get some more classic films like fright night and well the craft is pretty good but i never heard of monster high but i will give it a shot who knows it might be good.,1434240000,2,322,3.75
5846796,4,B00DPU26GI,Two of the four movies are awesome.,1433116800,,35,4.142857142857143
5846797,3,B00DPU26GI,All these movies are good.its cool how there is a disk for each movie but the rare movie here is brainscan. It's clear and does the job. But I wanted better resolution.,1430092800,4,168,4.28125
8596138,5,B00DPU26GI,Worth it for Fright Night or Brain Scan alone. And their all on their own disc. No flip discs. Nice set.  Nice price,1522800000,,116,4.043478260869565
8596139,1,B00DPU26GI,"The Craft and Fright Night are horror classics that I had previously owned and loved! Monster High and Brainscan was very good too. My issue with this collection is not the movies but the way they decided to package them.  They have four discs stacked on top of one another. DVDs get scratched and they decided to package them like this? Doesn't make sense.  Movies get 5-stars, packaging gets 1-star.",1520899200,,401,4.714285714285714
8596140,5,B00DPU26GI,Arrived when expected. Still in cellophane. All discs were there and in good shape. Very satisfied.,1518912000,,99,5.25
