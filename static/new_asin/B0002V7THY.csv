2122898,5,B0002V7THY,"I saw a press copy of the series and was absolutely awestruck.  It covers the history of the Broadway musical from its origins to present day, and manages to tell both the big stories and the little-known gems of performers, composers etc whose names have since faded from popular memory.  It's very PBS-like to use something so inherently American (the Broadway musical) to tell the story of our cultural history, as they did with the Baseball series, the Jazz series etc.  But it works beautifully, and the series is much more than just a collection of performance clips (if that's all you want, there are plenty of greatest-hits packages on the market).  The PBS series is the real deal.

One thing that really impressed me is the amount of film footage the filmmakers managed to find of original shows (some of the old stuff in color - amazing!).  Many thanks to whoever had the foresight to film this stuff and save it for posterity, and congrats to the filmmakers for hunting it down and giving it a proper showcase.  They also scored interviews with all the Broadway heavy-hitters, and got them to really talk instead of just repeating their old stories.  I loved seeing Michael Kidd, who talked about the ""dese, dem and dose"" characters in ""Guys and Dolls"" - himself in an old-school New York street accent!  And Jerry Mitchell's story about seeing ""A Chorus Line,"" learning the opening combination, landing a role and going on tour gave me chills.

Overall, a major achievement for PBS, a huge delight for theater buffs like myself, and a wonderful introduction to musical theater for anyone who thinks Broadway is just a street in Manhattan.  One complaint:  why does the Jazz series get 19 hours and Broadway only 6?  I would've liked to have seen more of everything.  A+++.",1097452800,55,1785,4.771986970684039
2122899,2,B0002V7THY,"This series is fine, I saw the six hours as a screener, but it is very ""movie-heavy"" which surprised me. I actually would prefer to hear the stories of the film ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" over the numerous movie clips of Broadway shows adapted by Hollywood. If you want movie clips see the Michael Feinstein Hollywood PBS series, which was wonderful. This one is a first-class production, very classy, but oddly enough it does not keep your interest the way the much more ""shoestring"" Golden Age film does. Perhaps this one was a bit too ambitous. But, it does look very elegant anyway.",1097280000,14,586,4.699029126213592
2122900,2,B0002V7THY,"Very competent PBS style program. Very much the style, if not the level of Ken Burns documentaries. Julie Andrews is the hostess who is very proficient. The early episodes are pretty good, but by the end it is very commericial, pro-Disney (did they underwrite this?), modern Times Square ad for NYC tourism. I wish there were less movie clips, but we have to be glad to have anything. But, if you want passion, see ""Broadway: The Golden Age,"" which I saw in a movie theater and comes out on DVD soon. That one's the real thing.",1097280000,16,527,4.5

I supplement with my own materials but the series brings it alive for my students. Thanks PBS.  Don't like the very expensive book that is supposed to go with it - doesn't really go with the series at all - it's just an expensive coffee table book - don't waste your money.  Go online to the PBS site to download much better materials.,1394236800,,486,4.08421052631579

My only objection is that many of the clips come from the motion picture versions of these great shows, as well as revivals without the Broadway cast.  It is fun and educational, and at times very moving.  Julie Andrews was a credible hostess.",1379289600,,410,4.913043478260869

My only criticism is that the producers over look the great American Broadway composer Cy Coleman composer of Sweet Charity,City of Angels,Will Rogers Follies among others. Cy Coleman was nominated for 20Tony awards won 5 and 10 Emmys and 2 Grammys. This series is a must for any student or anyone who loves show music but you would have to include Cy Coleman for an extra star.

I loved seeing the real performances--how they found those snippets of film has to be a story in itself.

I then rushed out to buy the musical album and eventually the DVD of the series. Now it is out on Blu Ray, and it is still as fabulous as it was when it was first produced. Unfortunately, it ends in 2004, and could use an update since so many fabulous shows have hit the boards since, but that is no reason not to enjoy it again if you are, as I am, a Broadway music fan. I especially liked the extra performances on each disc, giving viewers a chance to see not only how some of the magic was created but some of the early performers in live performances.

2123010,5,B0002V7THY,"If you're a Broadway musical fanatic as I am, you will be enthralled by ""B'Way, Broadway, The American Musical."" It's narrated by Julie Andrews and contains selections from the top musicals and commentary by many of the leading actors, producers, directors, writers, and Broadway luminaries. I've viewed it several times. It is six hours long with three hours of additional interviews and a special section on ""Wicked.""
It is divided into six one-hour episodes of chronological periods from 1893 to 2004. This time I concentrated on the last two eras: ""Tradition"" from 1957 to 1979, and ""Putting It Together"" from 1980 to 2004. In 1957 the great breakthrough musical was ""West Side Story"" with an inspired team of creative talents behind it. Broadway always has and always will keep breaking the mold. What keeps it alive is its great ability to change and evolve. Old timers who fail to see that will always say B'way is dead or dying, but it hasn't croaked yet and is making more money than ever.
As of September 2010 currently playing I counted these types: two rock, one semi-rap, four revivals, eleven original or adapted shows, and one psychological problem musical, ""Next to Normal"".
In 1964 came ""Fiddler"" which stressed the characters' ""tradition"" and was a great old-style musical. Over the years Broadway learned how to deal with serious subjects and tragedy. Some people saw ""Fiddler"" as the end of a golden age.
Through interviews with Hal Prince and Stephen Sondheim we see how a creative friendship was formed and how they reimagined and restructured the American musical. The new casts in musicals had to learn to do three things well rather than just one as before. They had to sing, dance, and act.
In the sixties a seismic shift was going on in American society, and Broadway had to move with it. Plays like an edgy ""Cabaret"" and the first rock musical ""Hair"" shifted the ground under the feet of theatergoers. Broadway began to fall out of synch with popular culture. ""Hair"" was the real game changer. I remember welcoming the new stuff while still enjoying ""Funny Girl"", ""Hello Dolly"", and ""Mame"".
In 1970 Sondheim's ""Company"" showed urban alienation, ""Chorus Line"" brought the gypsies front and center in 1975 and ran for 15 years, in `75 Kander and Ebb's ""Chicago"" drew on cynicism and black humor, and in 1979 Sondheim topped them all with his vision of the dark side in ""Sweeney Todd""
In 1980 to 2004 came Weber with his spectaculars. Disney arrived with a new brand of musicals, and ""The Lion King"" is still roaring. ""Forty-second Street"" was an old-fashioned show that ran for 8 years, and, of course, ""Cats"" took its litter box into the Winter Garden for 18 years. AIDS had a devastating effect on Broadway. In 1995 came ""Rent"" which again broke the mold and ran for 3000 performance. Nine-Eleven happened, and Broadway continued with blockbusters like ""Hairspray"" and ""Wicked"". The Broadway musical still lives, and we can be thankful for that.",1285632000,3,2973,4.900793650793651

2123015,4,B0002V7THY,"I'm a rather casual fan of Broadway musicals.  I've seen a handful of musicals in New York, own a handful of original cast recordings, have seen a bunch of touring, university, and high school musical productions, and have watched a number of film versions of famous musicals.  So, my review of this series is clearly shaped by my previous exposure to the world of Broadway.

From this perspective, I found this PBS production to be utterly fascinating.  Of the six-part series, I basically knew nothing that was mentioned in the first three parts, other than a few names about which I knew nothing specific.  It was so interesting to learn about George Cohan, Florenz Ziegfeld, Fanny Brice, Bert Williams, and so many other stars from a bygone era.  I especially loved the archival footage, which showcased some amazing talents from so long ago.

The final three parts featured dozens of musicals that I know, many that I have seen, several that I'd like to see, and a handful that were completely unfamiliar to me (if apparently rather important in the history of musical theatre).  Though this part was less earthshatteringly profound to me, I still appreciated gaining new perspective about particular aspects of how musicals are put on stage, including various collaborating teams, the role of producers, and the economic influences that shape the world of theatre.

Obviously, this was a rather ambitious project and falls short in some inevitable ways.  The folks who produced this documentary had to be selective about what people, shows, and topics they covered, so it is not surprising that some important stuff was missed.  That's simply the result of covering 100 years of history in six hours.  And I agree with another reviewer that the series seemed to be rather Sondheim-heavy, but his interviews, quotes, and historical footage were definitely some of the most engaging, so it's no wonder that he was so prominently featured.  More important than these gripes, my biggest disappointment was the chronology of the series.  More specifically, the six parts were organized around topics rather than dates, which means that the events were often covered out of order.  As the storyline moved forward and backward in time, especially during the first several parts, this made it difficult to put the pieces together in their appropriate context.  This may not be an issue for Broadway experts, but as someone watching this series with limited knowledge, this production choice was rather jarring and confusing for me.

These few frustrations notwithstanding, I really enjoyed this PBS series.  I learned a great deal about the history of Broadway musicals, was able to see some fabulous footage of classic moments on stage, was able to reminisce about some of my favorite shows, and gained a new-found appreciation for the wonder of the Broadway stage.

2123020,5,B0002V7THY,"One year for my birthday I received a trio of products based on Michael Kantor's documentary ""Broadway: the American Musical."" I received the book, the 5 CD set, and the DVD set as well.

I absolutely love them.

I've been doing theatre for over twenty years and I have both Bachelors and Masters degrees in theatre. I have a special love for the musical. This film goes into detail from the earliest days of Broadway, hitting the highlights from Ziegfeld and Cohen to Wicked. The story moves chronologically, but also finds themes: the commercialization of Broadway, the difficulty of mounting new productions, and the evolution of the artistic form.

Hosted by Julie Andrews, it shows a lot of archival footage, especially in the later chapters, juxtaposed with recent interviews. It's wonderful to see Jerry Orbach in the original Chicago and then hear his memories of the play in an interview taped before his death. There are very few films from those old days, but luckily so many numbers from musicals were featured on shows like The Ed Sullivan Show and are included here. It's also fun to see what Times Square looked like pre-Gulianni.

Extras include a behind the scenes look at Wicked and an early performance of Jonathan Larson's song ""Sunday."" Also included are additional interviews from many of Broadway's finest.

If I had one criticism it would be that it's not long enough to include all of my favorite shows, but I can live with that. It's really for the Broadway crowd, but if you're in the crowd you'll love it, and you'll want to pick up the book and CDs too.",1209600000,45,1582,4.759124087591241

Julie Andrews is perfect as the spokesperson and the subject matter makes you feel proud to be not only American, but human.

2123025,3,B0002V7THY,"...and being a self-professed ""dummy"" on the American Musical Theater I found this sort of ""Broadway History 101"" to be, at best, an entertaining starting point. I believe director Michael Kantor was handicapped from the start since the whole history of the ""Great White Way"" encompasses such a huge array of giants and geniuses (Ziegfeld, Jolson, Gershwin...) that at a mere six hours, the documentary feels like riding on a bus tour speeding 90 miles an hour. That odd feeling is magnified with Episode Four: ""Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'(1943-1960), the most important gem in the chest.  As been noted elsewhere, that golden era of the fabulous ""Book Musicals"" which produced an unmatchable run of landmark classics like ""Oklahoma"" and ""My Fair Lady"" could have alone been given a six hour treatment instead of this set's rushed, caffeinated hour. Clearly, the episode in Broadway parlance ""lays an egg"" and compromises this documentary's overall quality.

Still, there is fun to be had here and the filmmakers manage to skirt PBS' tendency to turn a giddy subject into a glum funeral march.  Julie Andrews is an exquisite host and I disagree with criticism about the high amount of movie clips used in episodes One through Three.  Movies of the 1930's in particular the early ""talkies"" appropriated so much of Broadway's luster and lore it seems only natural to use them. I also loved the novel use of a song's lyrics by showing the words playfully dancing in an about a sheet of music or a photograph.  And best of all, the ""talking heads"" used here all have something interesting to say with humor and clarity- a key element missing in, say, Ken Burn's ""Jazz.""",1140912000,17,1666,4.8936170212765955

In fact the people were Rudy Vallee, Jimmy Durante, and Cliff (""Ukelele Ike"") Edwards, from the Fox film GEORGE WHITE'S SCANDALS (1934), not the famous vaudeville team of Clayton, Jackson and Durante.  That team appeared in only one film, ROADHOUSE NIGHTS (Paramount, 1930), together with Helen Morgan.

2123032,3,B0002V7THY,"It's really wonderful to see footage of the Ziegfeld Follies, ""Pal Joey"", ""Oklahoma!"" and other shows that weren't preserved for film legally, but why do it in such a commericial way.

""Broadway- The American Musical"" was something many Broadway fans looked foward to and watched for those three nights on PBS. However, was the film as good as the website said it was? Not at all.

The first two hours of the show, in my opinion, were informative visually. There was interesting footage of Rodgers and Hart pretending to write ""Manhattan"", ""Showboat"" and some Ziegfeld girls. There were some nice tidbits as well.

The second two hours of the piece covered the Depression and some of the Golden Age. The Depression segments had some nice footage. The ""Pal Joey"" clips were quite interesting. However, the section was very Merman and Gershwin-heavy.

The Golden Age included a 15 minute segment on ""Oklahoma!"" that gave the viewer no new information at all, although there were some great film clips. ""Oklahoma!"" was probably the only musical throughly coverd in the segment. We skimmed past ""Carousel"", ""Kiss Me Kate"" and ""South Pacific"" and spent a bit of extra time on ""Guys and Dolls"", talked with Julie Andrews about ""My Fair Lady"" and then learned that Oscar Hammerstein was dead. What kind of golden age was that? Where's ""The Music Man"", ""Pajama Game"", ""The King and I"" and ""Damn Yankees?"" Not very good.

The third and final two hours were about the changing of the musical from the 1960s until the present day. ""West Side Story"" was nicely coverd, but ""Gypsy"", ""Hello Dolly"", ""Camelot"", ""How to Succeed..."" and ""Mame"" were pratically ignored. Of coruse, we had to cut to a long segment on ""Fiddler on the Roof."" ""Cabaret"" was done nicely, with interesting photos of the Boris Aronson set I'd never seen before. ""Company"" was also well handled. ""Follies"" was mentioned. ""Follies"" was one of the most important shows of the 70s and deserved more air time than ""Hair."" It was given too much time. It really was just a tourist attraction. ""A Chorus Line"" was over-handled as well (of course). ""Chicago"" was not. Rare movie clips? Is that a joke because that is what the webiste promised! Chita and Gwen dancing was nice, but we got the same clip Broadway's Lost Treasures gave us. They spent no time on Verdon or Fosse, except for this and this was utter nonsense.

The 80s segment, quite a commercial. Not only did it go on with the whole Porno deal on 42nd Street, but it also went on about how Disney saved New York. Michael Eisner was even interviewed! They can't interview Angela Lansbury, but they can interview Eisner? Come on!

Julie Andrews was a pretty bad host. She was very annoying and acted like the viewer didn't know who she was.

I think that this was an intersting look at the musical, but it could have been done better. Look how well Rick McKay's ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" turned out! That was what I was looking for. PBS, nice try, but try again.",1122249600,11,2973,4.7369439071566735

The critic thought that Mr. Kantor should have covered shows like ""Ragtime"" and ""Caroline, or Change."" Personally, when I watched the documentary, I felt that Mr. Kantor knew what he was doing. He only covered shows that were historical landmarks or broke new ground. He had to conclude with Wicked because it was the most successful show of the season. It's perfectly valid as the original Bess states about George Gershwin's perception of black people in ""Porgy and Bess"". ""Caroline, or Change"" got great reviews but it was a financial flop. As for the whole thing about how you never saw a full performance, oh, well, c'est la vie. Also, I am totally o.k. with the fact that Mr. Kantor never covers ""Annie.""

Yes yes yes, there will be hordes of folks who quibble that their ""all-time most important"" musical didn't make it, but that's missing the point.

You will feel as if you have a serious grasp of the development of the American musical after seeing this film. Period. Mission accomplished.

The first segments of the documentary, hosted by the ageless Julie Andrews, begin with Flo Ziegfeld, and the ""Follies"". One thing that hasn't been mentioned (yet) is the nice concomitant history lesson you get regarding New York, Times Square and American popular culture while absorbing this mini-series. The influence of opera (or more properly, operetta), vaudeville and minstrel shows are made abundantly clear, and are fascinating to someone like me who really had no exposure to this sort of material.

As we reach mid-century, more and more of the people talked ABOUT in the film are actually alive...and the shows discussed are ridiculously familiar to even the most ""uneducated"" viewer. Song after song reveals their source...standards that originated on Broadway that have become part of our cultural language.

Artistic ambition grows by leaps and bounds...from the musical ""revue"" to musical ""comedy"" to a dramatic ""book"" musical. Storytelling techniques through song and staging develop as fast as the geniuses on the stage, behind the stage and under the stage can think...

Some of the creators, like Sondheim, are expert at analysis and insight. They provide some great ""talking head"" moments about musicals that aren't theirs! By and large, the critics they used for the documentary come across as enthusiastic, overwhelmingly knowledgeable, incisive, playful...I thought as a group they were terrific, without any hint of elitism, snobbery or any number of other ""stereotypes"" one may have about a ""New York Broadway critic.""

My first audible gasp came at the end of episode five, when they play that ""I Love NY"" commercial from the late 70's. I remember seeing that as a kid, but the only thing that had any effect on me was the presence of Brooke Shields at the end of it.

People like Mandy Patinkin, Patti Lupone, Angela Lansbury, those ""Cats"" creatures and yes, I think that's Patrick Swayze in ""Grease"" mode...what a riot!

The most affecting portion, for me, is the last episode, for that encompasses most of my personal Broadway experience. I imagine that whatever era you feel the most affinity towards will have the same effect.

Spending 6-10 minutes per musical or producer seems criminal, until you simply appreciate the tidbits for what they are. They're like little gems. Fragments of shows that you yearn to see ALL of...

...so let me editorialize for a second.

All musicals should be filmed once with their original casts, if only for posterity. I own ""Sunday In The Park With George"" and ""Sweeney Todd"",  two exemplary musicals (covered here) and nice DVD's to own. What I wouldn't give for an ""Evita"" (not covered here) with Lupone and Patinkin, or the original cast of ""Rent"". There. Editorial done.

Speaking of ""Rent"", the final fifteen to twenty minutes of the movie are an emotional tidal wave. Seeing Jonathan Larson's last day of work on video...watching him make his last milk shake at the Moondance Diner...and then finding out he dies right before previews, is not heartbreaking, it's heart-shattering.

That segment leads into the piece on 9/11. Somber and a little creepy, as you've seen almost six hours of the busiest intersections on Earth suddenly empty, a modern ghost town.

The filmmakers then pull off a terrific stunt. They show the post 9/11 commercial encouraging people to come back to NY. It echoes the one from over two decades prior, yet is defiant, proud and yes, a little inspiring.

A quick cut to ""Hairspray"", specifically to the finale which may be the single most energetic song to ever grace the boards, and then summing it all up with ""Wicked"", a musical I coincidentally just saw three weeks ago (and loved), made for an amazing viewing experience and I could not recommend this any more highly.

Now, for those of you who DO own this, my copy is plagued by a jittery video (with pristine audio) across all three discs. No one else has mentioned this, so perhaps my case is isolated...

One last request: please watch the rehearsal ""bonus"" footage with Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, working on their song from Wicked called, ""For Good."" Watching and listening to these two outstanding singers tentatively creating these performances, intercut with footage from the final result, sent shivers up my spine.",1099872000,163,4733,5.021711366538953

2123046,2,B0002V7THY,"This will probably be a valuable tool to educators through the years. I did not find it especially entertaining as it was very much ""by the book"" in the traditional PBS sense. I would have preferred that we had heard more from the actual people that were there rather than so many acaademics and relatives of those who it was about. Also, I know so many others have said it as well, but way too many movie clips and you never knew what you were looking at. People were not identified, etc. But, I applaud them for taking the time to make it and for putting it all down. Still better to have this than not to have done it.

NOTE: I thoroughly enjoyed the extra interview footage. It is actually more entertaining and enlightening than the actual series. I wonder what they must still have and what they might have done with it?",1099180800,11,826,4.363636363636363
2123047,5,B0002V7THY,"I consider myself a theater afficianado...OK, a theater snob even. That said, I don't expect a 6 hour mini-series about the American musical to lavish 10 minutes on SHE LOVES ME...

Alhough this is aimed at a broad audience, the producers have done a masterful job trying to condense a hundred years of Bway history into 6 hours. It has been assembled with intelligence, taste, and great care, as opposed to that shoddy made-for-video

interview show (The Legends who were there) which is self-indulgent pap.

This wonderful achievement will stand the test of time as a magnificent perspective on the American musical theater. And the DVD allowed me to skip or scan through any references to Andrew Lloyd Webber, Les Miz, Cameron Mackintosh, Disney & some of the other disastrous invaders of recent years that have done all they could to destroy the Broadway musical. I understand why the producers chose to include that material. You can't make a new docu without acknowledging these events, but I can omit them from my viewing if I so desire.

BUY THIS!",1099180800,7,1055,4.877094972067039
2123048,2,B0002V7THY,"I was looking forward to this set, and I must say it left me cold. Sure, it's educational to some extent, but also cursory. Nothing is dealt with in any depth.

The first DVD suffers from the lack of film for the period. I'm sorry, but superimposing several stills of a performer on a stage to illustrate three different gestures over and over just doesn't cut it. You might as well read one of Ethan Mordden's Broadway history books and listen to a CD instead.

We're shown more footage of performers in the second DVD, but it only whets your appetite. It's frustrating to see brief, incomplete clips of Ethel Waters and Ethel Merman, tremendously exciting both, and then move on to the next topic. Frankly, it would have been better to have compiled complete rare footage of the very best performances and have left it at that.

By the end of the second DVD, I lost interest, so I'll defer to the others on this page about how the third DVD is.

The only saving feature to this set: the extras. When is the last time you bought a set where the extras were better than the main feature itself? That's the case here.

Therefore, I recommend buying, instead of this set, ""Broadway Lost Treasures"" and ""Broadway's Lost Treasures 2,"" which compile performances from the Tonys, and ""The Best of Broadway Musicals - Classic Performances from The Ed Sullivan Show."" Now, THAT's Broadway.",1098921600,56,1381,4.64344262295082
2123049,5,B0002V7THY,"This documentary spectacular succeeds marvelously within the limitations of the PBS program.  Inevitably, segments in the history of musical theater have been streamlined and/or eliminated in order to work within less than six hours.  Any attempt on Mr. Kantor's part to ""cover"" every person who contributed to this great form would have been devastatingly disappointing as a complete, final product.  His choice to probe certain stands and select musical issues succeeds in illuminating the whole, especially the segment about the creation of new work. I highly recommend this product as well as the companion book by Laurence Maslon.",1098489600,10,635,5.459183673469388
2123050,4,B0002V7THY,"The program sets out to cram 100+ years of Broadway history into 6 hours.  This means the final hour covers 1980 to the present which (ironically) is a period when many shows were video-taped for TV and for the Broadway archive.

I hope this set is a success and will prompt more in depth looks at some of today's creators.  A full 2-hour show could be devoted to Kander & Ebb, another to Andrew Lloyd Webber, still another to Stephen Sondheim. Get these people now while (except for Fred Ebb) they are still around and active in the theatre.

The Rodgers and Hammerstein shows were well covered in a 1980 PBS special hosted by Mary Martin..and THAT one should be exhumed and released on DVD.

Still, what IS here is well assembled and presented but even with the 3-hours of bonus material, it still only scratches the surface.",1098489600,13,827,4.5608108108108105
2123051,4,B0002V7THY,"About what some other reviewers said about the documentary using footage from movies:  ""Broadway"" DOES make extensive use of clips from movie musicals.  This is necessary because there is almost no film taken of stage productions that happened before the video era.  It makes for a much more appealing presentation than if they had taken a purist approach and only used footage of actual stage productions.  The movie clips are often identified, but often not.  One example is all of that Al Jolson footage, which was from several feature films he made from the late 1920's to 1940's.  Also there's a great looking clip of song pluggers in a tin pan alley office; this if from ""Rapsody In Blue"" a 1945 biopic about Gershwin. There are many many more examples.  Excerpts from 1950's TV shows are also used extensively, in addition to  The Ed Sullivan Show, there was a all star 1954 tribute to Rogers and Hammerstein, plus more from various unidentified programs.

Though I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary and think it well made, I was put off by it's focus on a limited number of key creative people and ignoring the contributions of lots of others.  This is a very common practice in documentaries, as well as textbooks about history.  It gives the impression that all worthwhile human endevors are the result of a few giants, rather than the result of the work and talent of many.  Musical theater progress and quality was not only about Ziegfield, Joson, Merman, The Gershiwins, Rogers and Hammerstein, etc.",1098316800,13,1514,4.87109375
2123052,5,B0002V7THY,"The series is fantastic.  You get insight into every era of the the Broadway musical.  The most surprising elements is how emotional the peices are.
