The picture sound and presentation are ALL top notch!! Neal Morse is a CLASS ACT and his love of music AND people come thru both in testimony and life in general.",1440720000,,299,4.0

8722329,5,B010FP0WFM,"This is a lot of music for the price, not that that is unusual for Neal Morse offerings.  I have waited a long time to see a live performance of ONE; this is stellar, warm and powerful.  Familiar dynamics are there, but there are some sparkling new elements: improvisational percussion and dramatic/ dance aspects which were not expected, but effective.",1476748800,,353,4.866666666666666
8722330,5,B010FP0WFM,"Wow! First some background - I am a fan of Pink Floyd, Genesis, Led Zeppelin, Yes, ELP and more recently the Flower Kings, IQ, Spock's Beard, Pendragon and Transatlantic. I also share the same faith as Mr Morse so these comments come from this perspective. As I sat and listened and watched this two disk set, I had an almost permanent smile on my face and the occasional tear. Neal has collected a group of top class musicians and singers together for this epic two evening show. As another reviewer stated, this is not 90 minutes but a few hours of concert (+ documentary which I have not seen yet). Being familiar with the material certainly helps enjoyment but I would say this is one of the best concerts I have on disk. There are a few speaking interludes where Mr Morse shares some of his story but these are brief, relevant, unhyped and often touching. If you don't know his story this will fill in a lot of blanks. Neal seems relaxed, casual and definitely enjoying the evenings. And the music is superb, especially with Mike Portnoy on drums. The mix is full, well balanced, well produced and actually sounds better than the original albums (with one exception of the a capella section of Author of confusion but even this part is still jaw dropping and impressive live). If you already like this type of Neal Morse's material (and share his faith or not) you will love this disc set. If you like the bands I mentioned at the beginning and don't mind that he clearly shares his faith story through the music then I think you will also really enjoy this work. The music ranges from driving progressive rock to an occasional pop ditty to quiet and soulful ballads with a definite emphasis on the former. I can see me going back to this set time and again to enjoy this music. Highly recommended!",1467072000,4,1803,4.533742331288344
8722331,5,B010FP0WFM,"First of all, it is not a 90 minute concert, like the running time spec given by Amazon.  There are 2 complete concerts here, close to 3 hours each.  In CD terms, it takes 6 CDs to fit the music.

Second, the production values are outstanding.  Video and audio are superb.  If you grew up liking Yes, ELP or Genesis, and maybe Styx and Kansas, this is for you.  Morse is a prolific writer and there is so much quality prog music here it is incredible.  The band is excellent, well rehearsed and Mike Portnoy is a monster on the drums.  Neal is great on keys and guitar.

This, of course, sounds a lot like the Morse-Portnoy band Transatlantic, and that is a good thing.

The caveat (if you care and you shouldn't, given the superb music here) is that this is Morse's Christian material.  In his other bands (Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, Flying Colors) he tempers his lyrics to not be so overtly religious and preachy.  They (his lyrics) have always being very spiritual but here they are outright Contemporary Christian.  I am an atheist and I am not bothered by this, the material and performance being so good and strong.  Enjoy it for what it is and the inspiration it gives Neal to create this music.  Like Mike says: ""Nothing but Prog Epics!"".",1451779200,4,1249,4.513392857142857
8722332,5,B010FP0WFM,"Thanks Neal for taking the time off for editing this in blu ray since the dvd can't be seen in my home theater as it should.
Everyone this is a must buy.",1442448000,,153,3.8125
8722333,5,B010FP0WFM,"The video is just a touch on the raw side early on, but it improves. What really makes this epic is the strength of the performance. This is a well rehearsed outfit of 20 musicians. This music is really a godsend and I can't believe it hasn't bent more ears. I was blessed to see Morse once. The energy he brings to the table is incredible. This performance is at the very top of his game.",1442016000,,389,4.131578947368421
8722334,3,B010FP0WFM,"This double show weekend was done after only four days of rehearsal at Neal's home church in Nashville. Neal is surrounded with his usual band and many back up singers. The intimate venue here has played a major role on how those shows would unravel. It offer the possibility for Neal to get some interactions with the crowd that was already sold to his charm. Maybe people that only visits this church for religious purposes could have been there, because of the religious beliefs of Neil. The story of Testimony 1 is connected with Neal's evolution in his life and the man is comfortable showing his devotion to God, especially for a man that has seen his daughter miraculously cure. The music reflects this evolution with songs that are the expression of a man searching for the truth during difficult times, and other songs that are more upbeat on a more festive side when Neal has found happiness in his life. This live release is more enjoyable with the DVD or Blu-Ray presentation, if you want to see those emotional moments, when Neal is in tears at times, or when he goes in the crowd letting people touch him, or when he show his affection for Mike Portnoy after his 15 years collaboration with him... Mike will return the favor later in the show with a speech. Sometimes when the female choir was singing, i had the impression to be in a gospel celebration in Harlem, but with a complete Rock band. So the music of the band was fitting like a glove in this church. Who wouldn't go to the church every Sunday to see the priest Neal Morse with his little orchestra?

The second disk is the complete ""One"" album with one additional track unreleased. We have heard previously the two best track : ""Author of Confusion"" and ""The Separated Man"" on others live releases, which contains long instrumentals passages of greatness. ""Cradle to the Grave"" is a ballad with Neal's son singing with him, when the latter was again very emotional. In the encore, the music was a welcome change to the atmosphere of the intense world of Neal with the song ""The Light"" of Spock's Beard and the final song ""Strangers in Your Soul"", where we're witnessing a crazy moment when almost everybody are playing others instruments. I didn't know that Mike Portnoy could play bass, unless his was faking... So another tour for Neal and another live release, i would have prefer to wait and hear something new from the latest ""The Grand Experiment"" album, but i can understand that Neal would jump on the opportunity to record something at home. 3.4 stars",1441929600,2,2536,4.660714285714286
8722335,5,B010FP0WFM,"Outstanding! If you are already a fan, you know the musicianship is out of this world. This product though, is very well edited, clear, and sounds very good (though stereo only, even on the BR). I can't say enough about this set! His lyrics speak to me in a way few do. Awesome!

A note to Amazon customers. Disregard the description saying that this won't play on US players. It absolutely WILL play on US players.",1441238400,,415,4.4605263157894735
