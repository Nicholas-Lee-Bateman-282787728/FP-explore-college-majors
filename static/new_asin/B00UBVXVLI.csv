7035585,5,B00UBVXVLI,"Dark and different. The only really likeable character is the little boy, who is wonderful. The adults act deplorably but that the way most people are. The film was beautifully shot and the costumes lovely.
I'll take a good period film even though its characters are flawed.",1470787200,15,274,4.851063829787234

7035589,5,B00UBVXVLI,I thought the casting was great in this movie.  Young and old Leo really have similar facial expressions and eyes.  The tale is bittersweet and well worth the watch.,1531180800,,165,4.655172413793103
7035590,1,B00UBVXVLI,"The poor boy was blamed for something that wasn't his fault. This story reminded me of Atonement, but definitely not as good. Not even close. It's sad, grey, and slow. If you want to watch something depressing, well here it is! Good luck with trying to watch from beginning to end, because there's no hope.",1531180800,,306,4.581818181818182

7035592,1,B00UBVXVLI,I admit I didn't get far into the film. Cute little overacting boy was the reason. Every nuance of every emotion registers in his cute little face. I'm going to find a foreign film.,1530748800,,181,4.352941176470588

7035594,3,B00UBVXVLI,"This reminds me of atonement, but less interesting plot.

7035595,4,B00UBVXVLI,"story was solid. I found the ending a bit of a cop out. They could have shown us the mother's demise, or at least shown us how hugh handled everything. I didn't like the casting of elder marion. She looked nothing like the young one. Poor use of a good actress. All in all, well worth watching. great cinematography!",1530576000,,316,4.372881355932203
7035596,4,B00UBVXVLI,"Never thought I'd use the following two words in one sentence ..Film was both endearing and SEXY...I enjoyed the CHILD ACTORS (infectious smile of Leo -totally immersed in his role).....Sort of bored with the same type of femme fatal:  emaciated, blonde, blue eyed....*Had difficulty averting my gaze away from the Farmer, Gorgeous!......Superb acting by entire cast....",1530403200,,370,5.607142857142857

7035599,4,B00UBVXVLI,"Jack Hollington was fantastic in this movie. A young actor and a very fine performance. The movie was okay. I did like it, but found it to be too long. The ending missed the mark. Marian thought the summer was beautiful, but for Leo, it was traumatic and painful.",1530230400,,263,4.387755102040816
7035600,5,B00UBVXVLI,"This is a beautifully poignant story of a fate ruling the women's life in the very beginning of the Edwardian era in England.  Women did not vote back then, nor had any real power to control her own life.  Also, the people lower than a certain titled class did not have the freedom nor power to be someone other than what they were born to be.
However, the key message of this seemingly a tragic love story is that the power of true love really mattered to both Marian and Ted, and made them strong enough to go against the society's restrictions to carry it out though in secrecy.  The generous understanding and forgiveness Hugh had for Marian before and even after the incident is also a true love in a different form.
The very young Leo's love for all three adults that he adored is also a very precious form of love.
What made this story a real tragedy is Marian's conservative mother's lack of understanding about what love is, along with her selfish motives and restricting ways of handling these situations with humanity.
So to me, this story read like a Summer of Love story in the 1900's.
The beautiful cinematography, superb acting from everyone in the cast, and the understated but alluring music made this lovely made-for-TV period film an even classier master piece.
I liked the ending where old Leo goes back to the manor to give Marian's message of love to her grandson with the renewed sense of mission as a go between.  Because he is happy to do this as he now truly understands the importance of conveying the message.",1530230400,,1537,4.557971014492754
7035601,2,B00UBVXVLI,Marion is certainly beautiful and some of the scenery is as well.  Otherwise I wish I hadn't seen it.,1529971200,,101,4.315789473684211

7035605,5,B00UBVXVLI,Sad and moving story of forbidden love. Beautiful scenery and costumes. Well acted the actors and by the actress who starred in The Paradise. I love period films.,1529280000,,162,4.821428571428571
7035606,4,B00UBVXVLI,This was a good movie...I was guessing throughout how it would end.  Jack Hollington was superb...he was absolutely adorable in this movie....you felt for him each time he registered sadness and his acting was first rate!  How unfortunate the sister did not have a say in whom she was going to be with.....but she was selfish to the end.,1529193600,,337,4.694915254237288
7035607,5,B00UBVXVLI,"As someone who enjoys period piece films, this was engaging.  The acting, costumes, filming locations were lovely.  Yes, the film has a sad tone as indicated in earlier reviews.  However, it was thoroughly enjoyable.",1529107200,,216,5.294117647058823
7035608,5,B00UBVXVLI,"A story about how negative psychological experiences gained while young and handled poorly by the involved adults can leave deep, harmful life-long scars.  This movie made me reflect on how society devalues the feelings of children  It pains me to think how much harm we are have and are inflicting on children as a result of our involvement in Korea, Vietnam and the Middle East as well as with young immigrants coming into this country as they are separated from their parents.  In the case of the latter, the parents are also guilty as they know coming to this country will result in such separation. Perhaps if we had fewer children, we'd treat them better and realize how precious they are.  Value is directly proportional to scarcity.",1529020800,,740,4.803149606299213
7035609,3,B00UBVXVLI,"Gloomy love story, kind of the same thing, forbidden love to someone in an underclass, arranged marriage by family: but really the story is about the boy who relays messages between the forbidden lovers. The characters were not developed they all are just flat characters, no surprise in any of them.",1528848000,,300,4.901960784313726
7035610,4,B00UBVXVLI,"A worthy film and story. The ways in which these 2 different classes used the boy, with at times, no real regard for his feelings was sad. Through reckless maneuverings, he was being exploited and neither especially the woman failed to see the emotional toll it was having on him. He was a sensitive and intelligent child on the edge of puberty and trying to figure out things in the adult world, at a time when propriety and class was at a premium. He began to see the disaster that lay ahead and tried to keep it from happening. Sadly, at a time when women of this class were very much controlled by their ability to attract the right marriage.,risking it all was always a dangerous option. Really the only decent person in this movie is actually the man who wanted to marry her in the first place. She deserved far less for what she did, not so much in falling in love with someone else, but of thinking of nobody else but herself.. Her own mother was an iron lady who didn't help the situation and treated her grown children with little regard for their emotions...but again, during this time, it was expected that a young woman of this class and status would do their part toward keeping the families respectability. The long term outcome all of it had on the little messenger, the go between, the visiting child - had far reaching impact. Very sad, but in the end...we see the child (now, Jim Broadbent) all grown up, a man, and ""Marian""...elderly Lynn Redgrave, a beauty, if there ever was one. The word ""spooning"" comes up a lot in the film. I'll leave it at that.",1528675200,5,1572,4.461805555555555
7035611,5,B00UBVXVLI,I liked this movie. Beautiful and sad...,1528588800,,40,4.857142857142857
7035612,5,B00UBVXVLI,I loved this movie. It is absolutely beautiful and the story was very intriguing. One of my recent favorites.,1528502400,,109,4.7894736842105265
7035613,5,B00UBVXVLI,"Set in 1900, the story of the summer experience of a young boy while visiting his far more affluent classmate recalls all the class hierarchy & economic strata of the time.  The palatial home & staff, along with examples of British upper-crust social pastimes & constraints are a bit intimidating for the boy.  He's easily inveigled by his chum's beautiful but ultimately selfish older sister to carry surreptitious messages to the tenant farmer with whom she pursues a secret romance, clearly forbidden by both class distinctions & her family.
The boy records in a diary the events & his changing feelings about his secret role & growing awareness of the complications for the principals.  The story is revealed as a flashback by an elderly man (Jim Broadbent) decades later as he contemplates how the experiences that summer affected his life.

The scenery, setting, cinematography & costumes are beautiful.  The winsome boy is superb, as is Joanna Vanderham (Denise in ""The Paradise"" and Pamela in ""Dancing on the Edge"") as the sister.  I don't remember the 1971 version with Julie Christie & Alan Bates well enough to compare them, but highly recommend this new adaptation of the 1953 book.",1528502400,9,1194,5.005050505050505
7035614,5,B00UBVXVLI,"Like a poem. Beautiful film,",1528416000,,28,4.8
7035615,4,B00UBVXVLI,"First, to distinguish and identify the film,  this is the 2015 remake, this screenplay written by Adrian Hodges, adapted from the same 1953 novel by LP Hartley.  Leo, the protagonist, is first seen as an elderly version of himself (Jim Broadbent), with a pained expression, picturing his young self seated across from him.  Young Leo (Jack Hollington), is invited by his upper-crust schoolmate to spend a holiday on his family estate. The schoolmate suddenly quarantined, Leo is immediately expensively suited-up and enthusiastically entertained by the older sister Marian (Joanna Vanderham).  She has an agenda, and all the attention is a ruse.  Shes having an affair with Ted (Ben Batt), a tenant farmer, and Leo is manipulated into carrying secret notes between them.  Marians mean mom (Lesley Manville) demands she marry Hugh ( Stephen Campbell Moore) for reasons of class and money.  Leo, an adorable and kind, sad-eyed, diminutive, almost-13-year-old, whose father died, is very vulnerable.  Nervous, but more fearful of losing favor, he reluctantly accedes. The consequences will be enormous. The piece is well-done, solidly acted (Jack Hollington is fabulous), beautifully filmed (Felix Wiedemann), edited (Stuart Gazzard), directed (Pete Travis) , scored (Christian Henson)- all of it top-notch.  But theres so much dialogue about this affair, with virtually no representation of it.  To be clear, the piece screams for, at least, a modicum of sex, lust, even sensuality.  But the really powerful overarching theme of the damaging and long-lasting effects of deception and exploitation, makes Leos story a compelling one.",1528329600,2,1630,5.48
7035616,3,B00UBVXVLI,"I thought the character of Leo was interesting.  The actor who played him did a great job!  Very endearing.  The scenery was beautiful as well.  However, the ending fell a bit flat for me.",1528329600,,188,4.4411764705882355
7035617,4,B00UBVXVLI,Beautifully filmed and well acted. The angst of  young minds is expressed rather than verbalized.,1528243200,,97,5.466666666666667

7035619,2,B00UBVXVLI,The scenery and period clothing where on par as was the beautiful castle . I found the acting a bit melodramatic and the cast did a great job with this boring storyline . The filming was excellent . A lot of moments of nothing when the story could have told us so much more . I felt they left out way to much and in the end give us not much closure which would have made this at least a better story .,1527984000,2,401,3.8433734939759034

7035624,5,B00UBVXVLI,Defintely dark and sad. Always difficult for me to watch the loss--and exploitation--of innocence. But it was superbly acted and achieved its goal. Tough to watch but beautiful,1527379200,,176,5.321428571428571
7035625,4,B00UBVXVLI,"I feel sorry for the little kid. Little dude got friend-zoned so hard lol. It's a good movie though. Makes you think about the brevity of life, especially the last couple minutes of the film.",1527292800,2,191,4.485714285714286

7035628,5,B00UBVXVLI,"This was an amazingly well-told story. Set at the turn of last century, it examines the Victorian era when it was at its peak of suffocating emotional issues. [We can thank Prince Albert for that.]
The Victorian life was cycles of set patterns and unspoken of rules and regulations that you DID not break for fear of being ostracized from society, -which was the only game in town at that time.
This movie is a film, that was filmed with plenty of emotional nuances about a time, where everything you felt, was best left unsaid. Especially a cry from the heart.",1527033600,5,561,4.564356435643564
7035629,5,B00UBVXVLI,"A story tinged with the sadness of a love that was never realized, a relationship frustrated by class hierarchy and the barriers imposed by members of society on those they felt were inferior. The coldness of the family's matriarch especially exemplified this class system.",1527033600,,273,5.2272727272727275
7035630,3,B00UBVXVLI,"We don't ever find out why it was so important for Marion to marry the Viscount--to save her family? Because they rented his estate and otherwise would have to move? Because her mother was a neurotic nutcase? Who knows? Who wouldn't prefer Ted, the hunky farmer to the scarred Lord Wickenham, or Wishington, or whatever? The kid was the youngest 12 year old I've ever seen, and once he turned 13? Well, he looked about 10, in my opinion. The hysteria of the mother when she sees her daughter with Ted was a bit much. Screaming and crying, and it didn't even matter, we find out in the end, cause the guy with the scar married her anyway. These stories of the time when women were property to be married off for money can only be watched with a healthy dose of contempt for the past and gratitude that the past is dead. Why the kid was so traumatized that he never married and lived a lonely life was also a little on the dramatic side and not really explained. I can see that finding Ted dead would have a lasting affect, but would it keep him from ever marrying? I don't know, and the movie didn't tell me.",1526688000,15,1107,4.301435406698564

8705256,4,B00UBVXVLI,"Visually, this is a gorgeous film. One day I would love to live in the United Kingdom and experience the countryside. It is just stunning. The wardrobes, the beauty of Marian and the handsome farmer, such a sad tale that only in Britain's past where a type of caste system still existed. So much has changed over the century that makes this story all the more poignant for in today's society when royalty marries commoners on a regular basis, this would have been more easily accepted. People marry for love now, not necessarily for family alliances. Yet as a mother, you can't help but feel for Marian's Mother who wants her to marry someone who is able to pamper her daughter and give her the finer things in life. Such a dilemma. The young man did an outstanding job. He was smitten. I didn't understand the belladonna in the end, though. It had nothing to do with the end of the plot unless it was that he wished that death would come to Burgess. I looked at the date it was released -- 1971. That makes more sense. Julie Christie was certainly beautiful and played her part as the agonized lover sympathetically. Well done.",1531267200,,1128,4.534313725490196
