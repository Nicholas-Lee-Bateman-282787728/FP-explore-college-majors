4673338,4,B005F96UHI,"It is as good as the first. The flying guillotine gets upgraded. Overall, I enjoyed the story. As usual, fighting constantly occurs along with a interesting story.",1337644800,3,163,5.074074074074074
4673339,5,B005F96UHI,"really enjoy seeing the movie again,havent seen it for 30 years. excellent movie,picture quality is a lot better, than i first seen it. cool movie.",1336608000,,147,4.92
4673340,3,B005F96UHI,This is an old school martial art style movie .The special effect is not as great as they are for the newer update movies. I have seen all version of the flying guillotine. It is a good movie for when it was originally made.,1326240000,,224,4.113636363636363
4673341,4,B005F96UHI,"After viewing the movie, ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"", I was instantly intrigued by the flying guillotine as a weapon.  To note, this movie IS NOT the sequel to ""Master of the Flying Guillotine."" There original ""Flying Guillotine"" came out in 1975.

When it comes to kung fu movies, I know the story can fall short.  This story had way more head-severing goodness than the first and the weapon adaptations kept me interested.  If you dig the lead actor in this movie, check out ""Opium and the Kung Fu Master.""",1326240000,13,514,4.677777777777778
4673342,4,B005F96UHI,I was surprised that his was just as good as the first. A very colorful and exciting movie! Revenge is the main subject and the villain is ruthless. A classic of the genre!,1325203200,7,172,4.242424242424242
4673343,3,B005F96UHI,Definitely would be better with English sub-titles (at one point his movie was dubbed in English). Otherwise still a great kung-fu movie!,1469059200,,137,5.2727272727272725
4673344,2,B005F96UHI,"Too bad it only has Chinese subtitles, otherwise it might be hard to follow.
UPDATE:
I was told by Amazon staff that there were English subtitles, (I tried to tell them), but setting captions to English only provides Mandarin Chinese subtitles. NO ENGLISH",1467244800,,255,4.953488372093023

4673346,5,B005F96UHI,i love this movie its one of my most watched movies the flying guillotine is obviously not a realistic weapon but still very cool im overly fascinated with the answer to defeat it a metal umbrella with out the cover.also the chicks in this movie fight just as well as the guys. I think out of all of the guillotine sequels this is the best one to buy. Ti lung is a great actor and actually studied under a famous Wing Chun Master. Its. a shame that he never actually played a Wing chun practioner in a movie even tho some of his movies are choreographed with his style in mind.its not the same.,1449532800,,594,4.219298245614035

4673368,5,B005F96UHI,"You have to get this movie; Ti Lung can never disappoint you with his martial arts skills.  This movie featured women martial arts experts as well.  The choreography of their martial arts was right on time.  As usual the Shaw brothers put together another hit.  You of course have to like this kind of movie.  For me it's nostalgic as I grew up with these movies, so I love them all.",1424476800,,383,4.338028169014085

4673384,4,B005F96UHI,"Visually it is crisp and clean. The movie is a great addition to the series and is more about the political times and strife than the terror of the Flying Guillotine, but a great movie all the same.",1416700800,,198,4.2368421052631575

Minus $10/$15 not as bad as waisting 3/4hrs of my life for these 2 Kung fu ""classics."" Save your time and money.",1408233600,,275,4.411764705882353

4673419,3,B005F96UHI,I used to see these type of movies in the theatre.  Having a DVD of it is great as Ti Lung is one of my favorite old time actors of Chinese martial arts.,1391212800,,153,3.6363636363636362

4673424,4,B005F96UHI,This movie will surely rank as one of Ti Lung's best movies with Shaw Brothers and features a most impressively choreographed fight sequence towards the end.,1373241600,,157,5.076923076923077
4673425,4,B005F96UHI,This guy is one of my favorites.  He is great actor and an excellent karate guy.  He is top notch,1366588800,4,97,3.8

4673427,4,B005F96UHI,The action was good but the movie took too many liberties with the story. The story went a stray when it called for the hero to be married with children that killed the premise of the hero in my opinion.,1362960000,,203,4.1
4673428,4,B005F96UHI,The ratings I assign to a movie are based on environment.  Another person might have a different opinion.  Thats why there is freedom of choice.,1361836800,,144,4.72

4673430,3,B005F96UHI,Pretty much exactly what the title says.  Not really great on fight scene choreography.  Mostly just running from and trying to duck the flying guillotines.,1359072000,4,156,5.2
4673431,5,B005F96UHI,Shaw Brothers are the greatest Martial Arts movie directors of all time! haven't watched this yet but i'm sure it will be good!,1355788800,,127,4.565217391304348
4673432,5,B005F96UHI,"If any one that has not watched part 1 of the flying guillotine, I recommend you watch it first before you watch part 2, so that you can have a full understanding of the story.  Part 1 is very intense, part 2 is even more exciting, and the ending of part 2 is so tragic that I wished It wouldn't have happened.  I enjoyed them, both parts.",1355097600,2,339,4.044776119402985
8469786,2,B005F96UHI,"Great movie, but when I made the purchase I was expecting the English dub of the film. The product details on Amazon listed that the Audio was in English, but when I started watching the movie the language of the film was in Mandarin with English subtitles. Now that I've started watching the movie I can't get a refund per Amazon's order cancellation policy. Usually this wouldn't bother me because I watch a lot of Asian films with the subtitles, but since the product details on Amazon said that the audio was in English, that's really what I was expecting when I made the purchase. Now I'm stuck with this movie instead of another Shaw Brothers movie I could've watched that included the English dub.",1526256000,,704,4.64
8469787,5,B005F96UHI,Great follow up on the original.  Great movie to watch for the choreography and plot.,1524787200,,85,4.666666666666667
8469788,5,B005F96UHI,"It's right after the events of the first film, where hero Ma has found a way to counter the devastating flying guillotines. But the evil emperor quickly upgrades them to counter Ma, and it's only with the help of a daughter of a court official that they might have a chance to finally end the tyrant once and for all.

This film is notable for its incredibly ruthless emperor, who manages to be both vicious and smart as the same time. You can feel the desperation of the forces against him, and for being a silly idea, the guillotines managed to be pretty impressive and not a little chilling. This one was a nailbiter to the end, and while the choreography isn't amazing, there's a sense of tension and menace found only in a few other films. Very enjoyable.",1494720000,,760,4.467625899280575
