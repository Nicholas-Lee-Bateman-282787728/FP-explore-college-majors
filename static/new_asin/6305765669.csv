1068563,5,6305765669,"I had watched ""Camille"" and ""Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse"" only because I had never seen a Rudolph Valentino film and was curious to see what all the fuss has been about. Now I know. I purchased ""The Son of the Sheik"" and, after seeing it several times, am captivated by his charisma just like thousands before me through the years. Of course, it is a bit corny and several parts are in such fast motion that they are comical; but, if accepted for the fantasy that it is, it is a truly beautiful, sexy romance. I've seen many reviews in which his facial expressions are thought to be comical; but, for the most part, I was mesmerized by the sexual tension that came across in those georgeos eyes! When he first brings his dancing girl to his camp and lights his cigarette and slowly takes off his belt while watching her over his shoulder with that smoldering stare, I actually felt fluttery and would have loved to have been that girl!  I have not, personally, seen any male heart-throb since Valentino, to the present day,  come even close to rivaling his natural ability to project such sensuality on screen.  And that raised eyebrow! Whew! I have now purchased ""The Sheik"" to see where the story all began. Can't wait to get carried away again!",1014595200,13,1251,4.551111111111111
1068564,5,6305765669,"I am a huge Rudolph Valentino fan.  I have been a collector for many years, collecting old Photoplay magazines, photos, tins, postcards, etc.  I, also, have most of his films on tape.  That is, the films that are still existing today. All the other so called great lovers are measured by Rudy's standards.  No one, past or present can compare to the Latin Lover.  Now - onto the movie.
Son of the Sheik was Valentino's last film before his untimely death at 31.  This film is incredible.  Rudy plays both the son and the formidable sheik in this, his last film.  He falls in love with a dancing girl, Yasmin, played by Vilma Banky.  They fall in love until he is captured and tortured.  Believing Yasmin to be responsible, he escapes and extracts his own form of revenge.  The tent scene where he has Yasmin at his mercy was incredibly sensuous.  You KNEW what Ahmed was planning to do to the beautiful Yasmin.  She knew it, too, but was powerless to stop him.  No matter how much pleading and begging she did, he drove her mercilessly to his bed.  One word - WOW! True love prevails, though, and all is saved.
Some might find a silent movie to be a bit corny but not I.  There is something enchanting - magical about watching Rudy.  He is without a doubt, the most graceful man captured on film.  No ONE walks or dances the way Rudy does.  He is poetry in motion.  I could watch him for hours . . .
He was blessed with a sinful handsomeness and those eyes . . .  They were almost hypnotic in their intensity.  It is soooooo easy to see why the women in the 1920's were filled with hysteria for this Latin Lover.  After all of these years has passed, his appeal shines forth in this, his final film.  There will never be another Rudolph Valentino.  He simply graced the screen with his presence and changed everyday life into something magical.  While watching him weave his magic, we forgot our troubles if only for a little.
*There is only one regret the world must have had when Rudy died.  His voice was never recorded.  His singing was but nothing of him ""speaking"". There has been much speculation over his voice and the transition from silent films to talkie films.  Would he have made such a successful transition where others had failed?  I believe he would have.  But we will never know for sure.*",993254400,26,2307,4.43436754176611
1068565,4,6305765669,"A very romantic movie starring one of the biggest idols of the century,  Rudolph Valentino. This is a better film then The Sheik both for its plot  and its cinematography. Watch both and judge for yourself!",968371200,4,206,4.694444444444445
1068566,5,6305765669,"Generations removed from today's technology and special effects, this  movie would seem amateurish to most people.  Looking at those eyes of  Valentino, I found it stunning.  A simple plot, a charming conglomeration  of characters, and stark settings only served to make him stand out even  more than he already did.  I'm sure he would have graduated to  ""talkies"" with all the grace, aplomb, and dazzling beauty that he  brought to the silent screen all those years ago.  And watching him, the  play of emotion on his face, I can see why women swooned. This  is definitely a must-see for you gals out there, trust me. BUY this, my  gosh, just for those EYES....yowza.",965347200,13,668,4.8053097345132745
1068567,4,6305765669,"This is the famous sequel to ""The Sheik"" (1921); it was  Valentino's biggest box-office hit and was in many respects superior to the  original. The plot is richer and more elaborate, with plenty of  action-packed sequences to counterbalance the romantic love scenes. This  was obviously meant to please male audiences: the 1920 movie had clicked  with female viewers, but Valentino managed to arise only jealousy on men.  Producers were more cautious this time and presented him now more like a  traditional action-adventure hero male viewers could relate to and identify  with. By all means an interesting piece of movie history which you ought to  see.
Picture quality is acceptable, though it is a bit scratched and  blotted, as it was transferred from an old print (I don't know if better  prints of this movie survived).  The new theater organ music score by Jack  Ward is adequate and sound quality is good.
A word of warning, however:  this edition was transferred from a print used for a re-release in the late  30's, when the infamous Production Code was already being enforced.  Accordingly, the movie seems to have been mercilessly butchered by Hays  Office censors.  Notably the famous scene when Valentino rapes Vilma Banky  was omitted.  I've never had the chance to see that scene myself but,  according to contemporary descriptions, the rape was subtly suggested by a  series of expressive closeups.  In this edition, the scene is abruptly cut  right after V. Banky walks backwards into Valentino's bedroom, followed by  Valentino himself. On account of this mutilation I gave this DVD only 4  instead of 5 stars. Maybe it deserved even less, for censorship is always a  totally unacceptable thing.",961804800,24,1714,5.050179211469534
1068639,5,6305765669,"Son of Sheik was released at the time of Rudolph Valentino's funeral during which thousands of mourning female fans caused a riot. The box office was besieged and grossed $1 million within a year and soon doubling that amount. Valentino was 31 at the time of his death. The plot was adapted from Edith Hull's novel in which Valentino plays the son of a sheik meets Vilma Banky who plays the role of a nomadic dancer. He immediately falls in love with her. She asks, ""who are you my Lord,"" ""I am he who loves you, is that not enough"" says Rudy.  When he is captured and tortured, he believes that she has tricked him, but soon realizes that she really loves him. Finally they meet and ride off to his sheikdom. Valentino took the role of his own father as sheik and Agnes Ayers reprised her part as his wife and Montague Love played the role of son's rival.",1436313600,2,856,4.35

1068641,3,6305765669,"What Louella Parsons described as ""the very picture for which the world's wife, mother and daughter have been waiting"" turns out to be an unspectacular potboiler that owes much of its reputation to Valentino's subsequent death and, one suspects, writers who have never even seen it and blithely accept the not surprisingly eulogistic nature of its reviews as gospel. Indeed, despite being the most popular start in the world when moviegoing was at its peak, most people know the name but wouldn't know the face if it was right next to them, so rarely are his films shown these days.

The plot barely justifies the length, the direction is rarely inspired, the production distinctly unspectacular and the comic relief is tiresome and grotesque, but if Valentino is coasting it in the lead role it is worth seeing for the real hint of his potential range in his second role as his father, the original 'Sheik.' Even ignoring his convincing make-up and the sometimes unusually ambitious process photography that brings the two Valentinos together, as the old man he would never become he delivers a calm, measured performance, instilling his movements with the gravitas that comes with age and maturity that is surprisingly impressive and hints at better things that might have been had his fame been given a chance to fade and be replaced by more interesting roles.",1292716800,4,1363,4.978070175438597
1068642,5,6305765669,"I love Rudolph Valentino and have watched his silent movies for ages and I find it hard to really pick a favorite.  He had such a naturalness and charm on the screen and if there was ever a true love affair in Rudys' life it was between he and the camera.  It adored him, and he knew how to entice and lure his audience through it.
 I think Son of The Sheik was a beautiful example of Rudolphs' attraction to the thousands of still loving fans that thrill to his beautiful face and mesmerizing eyes.  He had seething sexuality, yet little boy naughtiness all wrapped up into this gorgeous masculinity and it poured off the screen in waves whenever he appeared. You could not tear your self away from watching him and his movements and expressions were dead on target.  Son of The Sheik has been described in all of the reviews, and it is a good story of romance,supposed betrayal and reconciliation with a lot of action, pathos and embraces.  The cast is great and if this was to be Rudys last film, there is not a better one to get to know what all the shouting for and about him is about.
 I just wish he could have lived long enough to really exhibit his talent and charm in talkies and in later projects.  A man above the rest of yesterdays and todays leading men and heros.  Dont miss watching this treasure.",1224892800,6,1313,4.348360655737705
1068643,5,6305765669,"This movie highlights the assets of Rudoph Valentino very well.  He is young, sexy, passionate and a real ""man"".  Who wouldn't want to fall in love with him.  The movie also provides us with an exotic locale, a quick moving story and a great romance.  What more could anyone ask for?  Wouldn't you want to ride your horse into the desert with Rudy?",1184976000,2,348,4.4603174603174605
1068644,5,6305765669,"This is one of the greatest films ever made in the history of time. Even if you are not a fan of silent films I would recommend watching this masterpiece. I even like this movie better than the first movie simply titled The Sheik. Rudolph Valentino playing dual roles of the old Sheik and his son. Not only was he a sexy actor he was also good at acting. When I watch him acting I get so depressed that he didn`t convert to talkies. If he would of he would of won several awards.

  This movie also stars Hungarian actress Vilma Banky as Rudy`s love interest Yasmin. It also Agenes Aryes as the young sheik`s mother and his father`s wife. I don`t want to give the whole movie away,and think viewers should see it themselves. I am a devoted Valentino fan. I collect his movies and books about his life. I think he is a sex symbol who will never go out of style. This movie is a must see for ladies all over the world.",1154476800,10,916,4.193181818181818
1068645,5,6305765669,"As a historical silent movie, I enjoyed the disk very much. Considering when it was produced the scenery and technical aspects were very interesting. Jack Ward's pipe organ backup greatly enhanced the action of the film. Rudolph Valentino's eyes were very expressive. It is too bad that he met an untimely death. It would have been very interesting how he would have performed in sound motion pictures. Vilma Banky, as history tells us, couldn't make in the soundies because of a heavy accent. That is unfortunate, she was beautiful.

I am old enough to remember the silent movies and the Wurlitzer and similar Pipe Organs that backed and enhanced the silent movies.

 I collect silent movies for the joy of taking me back and the historical values.

1068646,5,6305765669,"""Not east of Suez but south of Algiers"" ... with these intertitles abounds one of the greatest legends of the Hollywood that is no more. When one thinks of those times one remembers The Wizard Of Oz, Casablanca ... and those
scenes between Rudolph Valentino and Vilma Banky in a tent under
the desert sun.
Made in 1926 for United Artists, directed by master director
George Fitzmaurice and destined to even beat the 1921 original
""The Sheik"" at the box office, this sequel to the former Valentino classic is in many ways the better of the two films.
Rudolph Valentino has never looked better than in this film, which would ultimately be his last, and Hungarian born Vilma
Banky outshines the original heroine Agnes Ayres from the ""The Sheik"" as well, together making these film the ultimate love story of the silent film age. Agnes Ayres however also appears in this film as the Sheik`s mother as a tribute to Valentino  (his father is played by Rudy as well in a double role). But the movie has more assets to it. It is also more handsomely produced than ""The Sheik"", it has a far more glossy look with its` bigger budget and excellent art direction (by William Cameron Menzies of ""Gone With The Wind""-fame), a slightly better script and it exposes far better the enormous acting range of Rudolph Valentino, who is still seen today only as the great Latin Lover (despite for example also being a great drama actor or comedian). The big difference might also le in the fact that ""The Sheik"" was a typical product of the studio system and ""The Son Of The Sheik"" was made far more independently. The other interesting fact is that when this movie was made the silent film style had changed greatly since 1921, making the former film look far more primitive. And it is no wonder that all the famous scenes by which Rudolph Valentino is still judged today emerge from this movie, while the other Valentino films (even ""The Sheik"") are mostly forgotten today - this movie has its place as a sort of silent screen pop icon (and probably the only silent film most people have heard of in their lifetime today - I remember that as a child I only knew one silent film actor - Rudy, courtesy of this film). This
is also probably the curse of this film. It overshadowed all of his work so much and even made the critical judgment of ""The Son Of The Sheik"" nearly impossible. In fact it is an entertaining piece of Hollywood fairytale, packed with action and romance, exotic escapism and a great climax when Rudolph Valentino frees his love interest Banky from a band of robbers and rides with her into the endless desert ... and right into movie eternity. Truly a film of these ages, even not hampered by its dated plotline and some outrageous ""silent film acting"".
A note about the video quality: after being available for two decades only on bad quality tapes, KINO on Video now has released the first really good print of this film. Though not as beautiful as some of their other films or a Kevin Brownlow restoration, this version is multi-tinted and has an appropiate organ score that enhances many of the scenes. Only some of the reels seem a bit washed out, but at least you have now the chance to get a good quality video tape from Rudy`s most famous film.",1044057600,13,3253,4.570205479452055
1068647,5,6305765669,"Like many classic movie buffs, I often wondered what all the fuss about Rudolph Valention a.k.a. ""The Great Lover"" was about. The answer lies in watching this mesmorizing film! Really a tongue-cheek examination of his own bigger-than-life personna, the actor magnificently portrays the double role of father and son. As Ahmed, the son, Rudy falls in love with the Hungarian Vilma Banky (as Yasmin), a beautiful dancer. Ahmed later holds the beguiling young woman responsible when he is captured and held for by her roguish father's thieves. When Ahmed's father, the Shiek, intervenes, it is discovered that Yasmin is innocent of betrayal and after some heavy derring-do, there is a happy ending. This fast-paced film from 1926 has lost none of it's charm with the passage of time and proves over and over again that Valentino was without question the least understood and most maligned of all of Hollywood's great stars. He was indeed an enigmatic presence in this film. The photography is ethereal, and the desert looks more enchanting here than in any film, and the chases, rescues and stunts are still wonderful to watch. Valentino would die prematurely at the age of 31 of peritonitis 26 August, 1926. For a great companion piece, watch Valentino's great 1921 hit THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE.",1036972800,5,1304,5.041666666666667
1068648,5,6305765669,"This is my favorite movie. Valentino acted with vitality and became emotionally sad and angry as needed. Although, besieged with the start of his illness, movie magic disguised his worn and inner frustration with his personal life quite well.

At first I was hesitant about getting the color-tinted version, as I am used to the black and white (which I do prefer, I think)--but this transfer is so beautifully done I can't complain. After a few minutes I got used to the yellow/blue tinting, and appreciated the crispness of the film. Definitely worth it.

7894263,4,6305765669,"This was the last film that Rudolph Valentino (1895-1926), an Italian-born actor did. He died soon after this film was released, when he was 31-years-old. More than a thousand people attended his funeral. It is said that some women committed suicide when they heard of his death. He is considered not to have been a very good actor, but he had great sex appeal. He was married and divorced several times.
The Sheik was a very popular film and propelled him to renown, so he followed it up with The Son of the Sheik where he played both the father from the prior film and his son. Some say that the former film was his best film, other say it was the follow-up film.
The Son of the Sheik is about a young Arab who falls in love with a dancer. He is kidnapped and is told by the kidnappers, untruthfully, that the dancer was part of the kidnapping scam. He believed what he was told but felt a mixture of love and anger, and after he is rescued, he wanted revenge.",1515542400,,962,4.291208791208791

7894268,4,6305765669,"The Sheik stars Rudolph Valentino in his most iconic role. Agnes Ayres stars as Lady Diana Mayo, a headstrong Western woman who infiltrates the private party of the handsome Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan (Valentino), When the Sheik later encounters Diana in the desert, he abducts her and takes her to his elaborate and sumptuous lair. Unable to resist the Sheiks magnetism, Dianas defiant nature gives way and she begins to develop affectionate feelings for her captor.

Valentinos star shone briefly. Born in Italy, the son of an army veterinarian, he failed in military school and came to Paris in 1912, ending up as a street hustler. He came to New York a year later, getting in trouble with the law. In 1917 he wound up in Hollywood, where he got bit parts until 1921 when he received his big break starring in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The film became a huge hit, and Valentino became an overnight sensation.

The Sheik was received with strong moral protests at the time of its release, but audiences loved it. Seen today, the silent movie suffers from melodramatic acting. Valentino stares intensely and uses body language to communicate, but almost seems to be self-parodying. Back in 1921, however, his looks and the daring exploits of his character made him one of the screens first romantic lovers. Valentino died in August,1926 at the age of 31. It is estimated that over 100,000 people lined the streets at his funeral in Manhattan.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary by Gayly Studlar, author of This Mad Masquerade: Stardom and Masculinity in the Jazz Age and co-editor of Visions of the East: Orientalism in Film; archival footage taken at Rudolph Valentinos funeral; and original theatrical trailer of Valentinos Blood and Sand (1922).",1496102400,,1785,4.963210702341137
