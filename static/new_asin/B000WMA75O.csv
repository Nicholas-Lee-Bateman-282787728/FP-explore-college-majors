2984276,5,B000WMA75O,"I loved this video. I love 60's, 70's, and 80's football. This was a time when the game was at it's finest. I'm a loyal and true Dallas Cowboys fan. One of the only things that I didn't like about the video was watching them lose the game. That was the first of 3 NFC Championship games that they lost in a row. I needed to see how it happend and now I have. The only other knock is that it doesn't show the halftime or post-game show. What it does do is show to every play and the commentary from Summeral and Brookshire is top notch. I wish they would release more full game footage such as this. If you are a real football fan, this is a great buy!",1205107200,5,651,3.9770992366412212
2984277,4,B000WMA75O,"If you're wondering what you get with this DVD, allow me to fill you in.  It's the game, just the game, and nothing but the game.  There is no pregame, halftime, or postgame.  The other question you might have is probably whether it is edited or not.  Good news and bad news here.  It is edited, but it isn't as bad as the quick replay games on the NFL Network.

What they have taken out are the fades into and out of commercials, any promos read during the game, and time spent marking off penalties.  I can live with all that.  What I don't like is that there are a couple of instances where they do jump from one play to the next.  There aren't many of these, but there are a couple (Montgomery's long run in the second quarter jumps right to the next play - Jaw's TD pass nullified by a penalty).  One other complaint that I have is that there are a couple of penalties that go unexplained.  You know there was a flag, but because they don't show the mark-off, we don't know what the penalty was.

The presentation is far from perfect, but I'm glad they gave us this much.  The video and audio are fine (Pat Summerall & Tom Brookshire on the call).  For the most part, the game does flow like the original broadcast.  Just be forewarned that there are a couple of nasty edits that bring it in at just over 2 hours.",1201392000,15,1318,4.195219123505976

8223892,3,B000WMA75O,"As a life long Cowboys fan in Philadelphia, I was at this game and I was 7 years old. I had been to two previous Cowboys games before. This was he first day at the Vet I truly felt the ignorance of eagles fans. As we all know, eagles fans are the most horrible fans in the world. Of course I was decked out in all my Cowboys glory along with my Mom. Bottom line, I was spit on at this game, A seven year old kid and I was spit on. What you hear about eagles fans is true and times it by a hundred.  As for the game, I have this game full on dvd with the pre game, so I do not need this. Some of my fellow Cowboys fans on here are mad there is no pre or post game CBS show on here. Believe me, you do not want to see it.  Life long Cowboys fan Phyllis George was always a respectful woman and she had on an green scarf and looked like an eagles fan which she was not. Miss George to this day is a strong Cowboys fan but they dud have her dress in a Kilmer jersey one time and she did not like it that much. So she is in a green scarf and personally as a Cowboys fan that is not the scene I want to remember.  Funny, I was spit on, saw my Cowboys lose this game in person and had to deal with the worst fans in the world and the Redskins and 49ers losses hit me worse. This is the last game of the 60's and 70's royal blue jerseys which I loved. The next year they debuted the new blue jersey and honestly it was my favorite Cowboys jersey of all time. Also, I note that the Cowboys lost this game and most reviews on here are by Cowboys fans. That is saying something so next time you hear we are band wagon jumpers, this was a sad and horrible loss and we are writing the most reviews and showing class.  I promise you eagles fans would not do the same. Watching the game it reflects the 1980 season. Tony fumbled too much and our defense was not nearly as dominant as in the past. Our linebackers over ran plays and our secondary was too young and not good enough. Charlie Waters played his heart out but watching the Cowboys you could just tell they did not have it that day. They had to come back against the Falcons which were actually a better team than the eagles that season. The Cowboys split both games with the eagles The game in October one of the best games you could ever watch until the end when on fourth down Tony Hill was interfered with BADLY by eagles Roynell Young yet there was no flag. In the game a few weeks before this game the Cowboys destroyed the eagles in the first half. The jumped to a three touchdown lead and this was the game that Dennis Thurman pulled the trigger on Charmichael to end his consecutive catching streak and also this was the game Randy White chased down an eagles wide receiver who was track champion. The Cowboys won that game but barely because the eagles offense came roaring back. The Cowboys won the game but lost the division that same day because the Cowboys had to beat the eagles by a certain point spread to win the division. Strange huh? So the Cowboys lost the division because they did not score enough points or win by enough points. That was the tie break that gave the eagles the division. That is the reason the Cowboys had to play an extra game and play in frigid Philadelphia that day. I can tell you, the game was played in extremely cold weather. Look at how the Cowboys played the big run by Montgomery. It looks like they do not even want to hit anyone. The turf at the Vet was even worse when it was cold, especially that cold. At times during the game looking back on it it seems the Cowboys could not get back on the bus son enough. Bottom line the eagles this was their time and they deserved to win the game. However the wind limited both teams who could chuck the ball all over the field and the Cowboys had better weapons in the passing game than the eagles. The eagles wanted this game more that day, plain and simple.  Some Cowboys trivia:  Wilbert Montgomery played in college with Clint Longley former Cowboys Thanksgiving hero and hey played against Thomas ""Hollywood"" Henderson.

8223900,5,B000WMA75O,"This copy is in excellent shape. I remember watching this game more than 28 years ago and as a Cowboys fan, it wasn't a very good game for us, but for the Eagles, well, this is one of their greatest moments. The prevailing winds keep the Eagles passing game from being effective, but it don't matter since Wilbert Montgomery has one of his best games as a pro. What can I say other than I baught it for some research and some old nostalgia. Anyways, great condition. The clarity is superb for being 28 years old.",1234656000,3,512,4.34375
