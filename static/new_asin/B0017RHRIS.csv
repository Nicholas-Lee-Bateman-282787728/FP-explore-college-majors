8267026,3,B0017RHRIS,"This dvd consists of 10 moves or so.  Of the ten, two were worthwhile in my opinion.  Some were kick ball changes and pour de bras and what we've seen a million times before.  There is also a few counts of 8 put together at the end that do not include the 10 moves that are broken down on the menu.  It's an ok combo that he gives, not great.  Also, even thought it's only considered an ""extra bonus"", the breakdown of popping is very poor. The creator is a good dancer, though not the best teacher.  I think he is good enough compared to many others.

I give it 3 stars because the dvd does not live up to the title of being called a syllabus.  While he did touch upon a couple of things I find important when performing hip hop, I would not advise anyone to purchase this dvd unless they have no access to any class or other dvds.  The content was very limited.  There could have been hours of material on here, but there isn't. Marco should try again, because I believe he has the potential to create an amazing dvd for sure.  This just isn't it :(",1334275200,,1051,4.12807881773399
