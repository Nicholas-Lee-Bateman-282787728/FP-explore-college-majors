NEW YEARS NINJA PARTY

this DVD was from the New Years party concert and JCW event that Psychopathic held. Through the night we would see a match from JCW and then a performance from a Psychopathic artist. The night would be hosted by ICP.

1. JIMMY JACOBS VS BULL PAIN VS KOWABATA-Isibella Smothers came to the ring with Pain and attacked Jacobs to start the match. From there Jimmy would not be involved to much throughout the match. Pain and Kowabata would do battle for most of the match but once Jacobs gets in he ends up winning the match using his phone. Decent match to start the night off with.

Next up would be a performance from Ill E. Gal. After being introduced by Violent J's wife Sugar Slam. She performers three to four songs including her version of Whip Ya Hair.

2. THE BUMPIN UGLIES VS THE SCRUB CLUB-this was a six man tag match that had the Bumpin Uglies 1, 2, and 3 against Mad Man Pondo, Necro Butcher, and Balls Mahoney. This was basically just a big brawl with all kinds of weapons involved. This thing is all over the place including into the audience. This was a fun match that was just pure entertainment with The Scrub Club.

Next we have Sugar Slam returning with her three helpers to give some stuff away to the audience.

3. OFFICER COLT CABANA VS THE WEEDMAN-this was one of the bets matches of the night which makes sense with Cabana being in it. The crowd was really into this one as The Weedman played nicely to the Juggalos. Weedman gets the win here after a super kick puts Colt on the mat for the three count. This was a really good match and maybe the best of the event.

Right here we get Slam and the girls back out giving away stuff to the crowd.

4.[TAG TITLE]RAVEN & SEXY SLIM GOODY VS THE RING RYDAS-this match was for the tag titles as the fan favorite Ring Rydas would vie for the titles. This was a good match with Raven not wanting to get involved to much. The Rydas control this match and end up winning the titles, the crowd was great with their entrance music, Whoop Whoop.

Next up we get Sugar and ICP introducing Blaze Ya Dead Homie. Blaze does his set and kills it as the crowd is really into it.

5. THE SAMOAN WARRIOR VS RHINO-this was one of the better matches on the set with fan favorite Rhino going at it with the Samoan Warrior. Both guys are big brawlers and each puts up a great fight. In the end Rhino nails that gore and gets the victory in a good match.

Next up ICP comes out for the countdown to New Years into 2012.followed by a good Michael Jackson impersonator doing Thriller. After that DJ Clay steps aside to let Mike E Clark do his set. Then Sugar Slam and Ill E Gal introduce the main event.

6. THE HEADBANGERS VS 2 TUFF TONY & SHOCKWAVE THE ROBOT-pretty good but short main event with Tony and Shockwave working well together. The Headbangers get their moments in but Tony and Wave get the win in a good one.

After the last match Blaze, Slam, and Gal introduce ICP as they end the show performing.",1430006400,2,3001,4.309058614564831

8510060,1,B0074JOD7Q,The quality of the concert is really bad. Not even worth getting. I wish I never ordered this dvd. Much better seeing the concert live,1382486400,,134,4.4
8510061,2,B0074JOD7Q,I been a down juggalo since 99' and don't wanna hate but this dvd sucked. The mec performance was decent but that's about it for me. The audio sound was jus too cracked n jacked up to enjoy. I love jcw and I witnessed the most disappointing matches ever. Mostly cuz gweedo and 3D dnt even commentate on any of it. The only reason it gets a rating above 1 is cuz it was cheap and mike clarks set was kinda dope.,1341360000,5,410,4.012195121951219
