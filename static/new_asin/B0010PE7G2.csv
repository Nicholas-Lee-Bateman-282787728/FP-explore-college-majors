I saw one of the actors (O'Connor) in a play recently, and his performance blew me away. So when I read that he was in ""WTF"" I made a point of checking it out at the local Seattle DVD screening. I bought the DVD and have watched it over a dozen times now. I still laugh hysterically every time. The entire cast is great, but Darragh Kennan (Max) and Shannon Kipp (Beverlia) are particular standouts.

I know very little about the theater, but the comedy is universal (surely, you don't have to sell paper in order to enjoy ""The Office""). So please, please, please buy this DVD!! I can't wait to see what happens in the next season...",1207094400,,837,4.358974358974359

It centers around a local theater, its owner and the characters who run/ work at the theater.  The really great thing about the show is that it captures the odd behavior of actors, some take life seriously, some are involved only because they are looking for a hobby. It is filmed ""ala"" The Office, meaning that they talk to the camera and are interviewed at points.  Overall it is a good show, the only issue I have is that every episode is so short. I understand why the episodes are so short (roughly ten minutes) I just think that an extended version could capture the story better. Some of the stand out characters are: Dave, Max, and Jane who is really a beautiful woman who deserves her own stalker. Not me though I have better things to do.",1203120000,4,849,4.333333333333333
