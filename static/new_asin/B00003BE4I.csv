7917017,5,B00003BE4I,"this was one of my favs during the 90s. i still watch it and find
it entertaining, especially when the kids get back at 'Kirk', the
film's main antagonist. anyway, i'm glad it's being sold so i can
add it to my Disney collection. i highly recommend this film to
families and kids 12 years old and below, although some early and
late teens MAY like it too.",1321747200,,355,4.235294117647059
7917018,5,B00003BE4I,"This was on tv today, so I watched it to refresh my memory! It's very funny! I love all the jokes and slapstick humor. Scout Bozell has always dreamed of being a member of the safety patrol. When he finally becomes one, his principal gets the school boundaries changed, so Scout is forced to go to another school. At his new school; the safety patrol are mean and rotten. He befriends a smokin' hot cheerleader named Hannah Zapruder and a few more friends. When Scout is set up and framed for something he didn't do, he is stripped of his badge. Mr. Zapruder has proof that Scout is innocent, so they play it live at a Fall Festival with the help of Weird Al Yankovic! I highly recommend SAFETY PATROL!!!",1242604800,,704,4.423076923076923
7917019,1,B00003BE4I,"One thing I hate most about this movie is seeing Scout Bozell float up in the air with a whole bunch of balloons like Pascal in the story of the Red Balloon.  Due to Newton's law of gravity, this is the strangest thing I have ever seen in my entire life, and that is what scares me most about movies or TV starring real people.  So if this is one thing you hate or don't like about TV, do me a favor and don't ever buy this movie.",1073692800,,430,3.875
7917020,3,B00003BE4I,I think this movie was sooo stupid but funnnyy too watch,1049500800,,56,4.181818181818182
7917021,4,B00003BE4I,"This was a good movie, mainly geared towards the 4-12 age level. Most grownups don't mind sitting through it once. What I was upset about was the false advertising around this film. They list Leslie Nielsen as a crucial character when hes only onscreen 10 minuites. The back of the box also makes it sound as if Leslie Nielsen and Bug Hall of ""The Little Rascals"" team up and they don't in the film. This movie is about A 12 year old boy, Scout Bozell. All his life hes wanted to be on the Safety Patrol. The only problem is that hes accident prone wich leads to hilarious consequences. Just as he gets his chance, he is relocated to another school where the Safety Patrol is made up of a team of bullies! There he meets a cast of wacky friends including a kid withe a phobia of frog's and a validvictorian cheerleader. When school supplies is being stolen, We find that the crooks are the cook, the janitor, and the safety patrol! When Scout is framed for all their wrongdoings, he and his friends team up to catch the bad guys at the fall ball, with the help of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic! Little kids can't stop laughing when they watch this film! This video comes in a clamshell case so you can preserve it for a long time!",989798400,6,1220,4.331877729257642
7917022,5,B00003BE4I,"When Scout Bozell finally makes the Safety Patrol at his school, he is transfered to a new school. The new school also has a safety patrol, but they are mean, and don't seem to care about helping people. To get Scout in trouble, they let him join. Then at an awards ceremony, they put the principal's office key and a lighter in Scout's pocket. One of the other patrol members tells Scout to get his gloves in the safety office. Suddenly, a fire happens in the principal's office. Scout puts it out, but the key and lighter are found in his pocket, and he is removed from the safety patrol and is not allowed to attend the Fall Ball at Osoloco Lake. The appearance of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic singing ""Gump"" and ""The Ballad of Kent Marlow"" at the Fall Ball was a special treat. Buy this movie!!!!!!!",982713600,6,794,4.408163265306122
