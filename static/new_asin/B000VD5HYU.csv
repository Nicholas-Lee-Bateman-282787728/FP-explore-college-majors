8218156,4,B000VD5HYU,"One word that describes this series is ... amateur.  But in a good way.  It's amateur only in comparison to many new science shows of the 2000's, which are more like blockbuster presentations.  A Science program should not necessarily be an entertainment, but must be educational and informative, which this is!  In fact, these videos provide a great introduction to biology topics.  When coupled with a class, these provide excellent addendum to textbooks by adding pictures, motion, diagrams, graphics, and hence flavor to your studies.  Also by amateur, I mean that these panel of speakers are more personable, improvised, and speak from their profession rather than a script.  In fact, it reminds me of being in class, with guest speakers showing models of hearts, diagrams etc.

If you like biology that's flashy and entertaining, I recommend Inside the Living Body, and The Incredible Human Machine.  But if you like a more personable touch and being in class, this one's for you.  Either way, they all do its job, to educate.

As far as the series, I rented all 3 from the local library.  I liked Major Systems and Organs the best, hence I purchased only this one from Amazon Market Place.  I felt it covered more parts of our body system than the other two.  The MusculoSkeletal and Nervous System programs seemed too dry and boring, but they did cover the material in substantial detail to adequately supplement a class.",1272499200,2,1429,4.9
