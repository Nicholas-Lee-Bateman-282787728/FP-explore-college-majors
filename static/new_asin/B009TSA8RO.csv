5368002,4,B009TSA8RO,Saw him twice in 2012 once with McAuley and once with Van Landing doing vocals.  Stability of lineups has never existed but the awesome tone and melody of the Michael Schenker guitar playing makes all listening encounters worth the time...,1361577600,,239,4.975
5368003,5,B009TSA8RO,"The recording is amazing, the songs are great.  Doogie White is a great singer, I don't know where he came from but he's awesome.",1361232000,,129,4.375
5368004,5,B009TSA8RO,I have the deluxe edition.  There is no Menu on the Blu-Ray.  How do you find the extra footage after the Tilberg show???,1360972800,,121,4.217391304347826
5368005,5,B009TSA8RO,"Awesome show! This is a nice package, with a booklet of cool photos! Cd of the show, along with the blu ray! Plus a bonus dvd with extras!",1359244800,,138,3.9642857142857144
5368006,5,B009TSA8RO,"With the release of this special edition 2CD/DVD/Blu-Ray package from Micheal his rebirth is complete, this is by far the best release of the last twenty years by Michael. His playing is crystal clear and he smokes with a vengeance, thank god the sins of the past have been tossed aside by a clear eyed sober Michael. No shortened set here plenty of past greats and new greats. From UFO the Scorpions and right on through MSG this is his best live release since the early 80's. The line up of guests includes several members (and former members)of the Scorpions not the least of which is his brother Rudolph, who does his usual smooth riffing on several tracks. Also on stage is Jeff Scott Soto, Michael Voss, Herman Rarebell, and Francis Buchholz. If your a life long fan like myself or someone who left the fold this is the Michael Schenker release you have been waiting for, I got this yesterday (01/22/2013) in the mail and it hasn't left my blu-ray player since I am on my 5th spin as I type this. Thank you Michael for releasing one of your best CD's/LP's in over 40 years of recording, and I am so glad that you have left all your demons behind to rise up for this welcomed rebirth of one of the greatest guitarists of all time.",1358899200,7,1235,4.421052631578948
5368007,5,B009TSA8RO,"First let me say I was blown away by old good the old boys sounded.  Ex-Scorpions (if you can call them that) Herman Rarebell and Francis Buchholz lay down a phenomenal rhythm and bottom end allowing Schenker to perform his magic.  Michael's playing has been extremely inconsistent over the years, but not here.  The sound, performance and track list are all worthy of 5 stars.  The last thing I wanted to mention is the video.  When Michael plays his solos, you see Michael play the solos....no ADHD, one second view, over-editing.
Yeah a short review, but if you are a Schenker, UFO, and/or Scorpions fan, this is one of the biggest no brainers I have ever reviewed. A hard rock must have.",1358640000,4,691,4.631147540983607
5368008,5,B009TSA8RO,"I have seen Michael 2x on this tour in 2012 in Houston. Both in very intimate settings. Wayne is the only one that was with him both times. I had heard about the line up overseas and so hoped it would be released at some point. I can't wait, the first time here he had Robin McCauley with him and they did an excellent set covering all of Michael's carrer from Scorps (going way back to the first album) on. He hit every era. The second time he had a different singer and focus a large part of the set on the UFO era. Both times I was brought back to why I love Michael's music so much. The second time I was standing right in front of him, only a small barrier between us as he took us through and amazing journey. I got some great pics that night! ROCK ON MSG!",1356998400,10,762,3.9869281045751634
5368009,5,B009TSA8RO,"It's not out yet but the trailer for it looks/sounds awesome! Always been a Schenker fan since UFO days, love his choppy lead style.

8544269,5,B009TSA8RO,This is awesome.  Michael Schenker is one of the greatest guitarist who ever lived.,1500681600,,83,4.928571428571429
8544270,5,B009TSA8RO,"Straight Up rock n roll, the Audio is Crisp and the Video is good.  A good mix of UFO and Scorpions songs, no bells and whistles on this blu ray you stick in the player and your off, no menus or setup.  I was waiting for Michael to pop a vain there on some of the tracks.",1451174400,,271,3.736842105263158
8544271,5,B009TSA8RO,Mr. S is DEFINITELY one of THE best guitarists of his genre and totally underappreciated. Good job!!!!!,1405209600,,103,5.117647058823529
8544272,5,B009TSA8RO,"In Your Face Like a  METAL FIST ! .......What else is there to say, Schenker ROCKS!

Great Sound & Video

Seen him live, just as good",1365811200,,133,4.038461538461538
8544273,5,B009TSA8RO,I would recommend this deluxe edition of the Schenker band to anyone who likes Schenker's style of playing. It will probably be the best tour DVD of Schenker's career. Anyone who takes avantage of this offer will not be disappointed!,1365552000,,233,4.85
8544274,5,B009TSA8RO,Why are you wasting your time reading this review? You know that Mikey is at his best playing old scorps and ufo classics!!,1364688000,,123,4.391304347826087
8544275,5,B009TSA8RO,"Michael Schenker is probably one of the best guitar players to ever play rock music of any kind. He started at 15 years old playing with his brother Rudolf on the very first Scorpions record and continues to this day as a solo act. This collection shows why he is so good playing songs from his entire career including from Scorpions, UFO and MSG. There is even a dvd of him playing with Herman Rarebell and Francis Bucholz of Scorpions in a tiny little rehearsal space going through tons of old material. No BS. He just plugs in to his Marshall amp and easily makes all other guitar players look like amateurs. Priceless!",1364428800,,622,4.513274336283186
8544276,5,B009TSA8RO,"good quality, it was for my husband and he has been a Schenker for years and he said this rocks",1362614400,,95,3.8
8544277,5,B009TSA8RO,"I've been a huge Schenker fan since the late 70's. Michael Schenker is pure genious when it comes to his passion for the guitar and this new release is not to be missed. I strongly recommend picking up the limited edition set because the extras make it a steal. The sound is solid and the performance is tight although Herman Rarebell's timing was a bit off while playing ""Assault Attack"". That said, the live performances and sound quality is killer! Schenker has Francis Bucholz on bass and Herman Rarebell on drums, both of whom he played together with in the Scorpions and the chemistry is noticeable. Michael Schenker proves that he is back with a vengeance with this release and if you're hedging on whether or not to buy this, don't worry. It's not just must own for collectors and diehards. It's a great release for all serious metal fans to pick up on and enjoy. The main reason I picked up the limited edition version was because of the packaging which includes 2 cd's, a dvd and a blu-ray. This is not a half-baked effort to cash in, this is right up there with his very best work. I've met Michael several times, have seen him perform numerous times and have been enjoying his music since UFO. I know how important his fans are to him and especially his performances so trust me when I say that this delivers!",1362355200,,1321,4.508333333333334
8544278,5,B009TSA8RO,"Every Michael Schenker fan should own this set. This is an excellent set that features a Blu-Ray/DVD/ 2 CD's of great live performances, great quality and sound. This is a limited numbered set, so don't drag your feet on this one, they will be gone soon.",1362096000,,254,4.543478260869565
