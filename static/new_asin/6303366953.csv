634283,2,6303366953,"For the record, please note that I am reviewing a specific version of ""Phantom Empire"", not the serial itself.  The version I am talking about is by Digiview.  Digiview makes those cheap DVDs you find at Walmart.  You know, the ones that cost a dollar, and are packaged in slim cases.  Like many companies of this type, Digiview specializes in public domain titles.  This release is no exception.  What you will get is a poor quality print with muffled sound, and no extras.  Please ignore the cover which says ""Digitally Remastered""; it is not. But I knew that when I bought this DVD used.  What I didn't know was that this is an edited print which takes the 12 chapters of the serial and combines them into a bizarre 90 minute ""movie"".

So be advised, if you spot this DVD somewhere.

Maybe someday Image Entertainment will release a complete version, as they have done with the Flash Gordon serials. There is another company which has it in two volumes (six chapters per DVD), but from the reviews posted here, it appears as if that print isn't too hot either.  Oh well, someday.",1127520000,29,1082,4.583333333333333
634284,5,6303366953,"This is the first film that Gene Autry made after his guest star role in Old Santa Fe with Ken Maynard. By all accounts his guest appearance wound up taking star billing over Maynard.  He was then offered the role playing himself in this first western science fiction serial cliffhanger.  You will see a young radio singer who he himself felt that he could not act, make a movie that set his career on fire.  He is a radio star on Radio Ranch, which is a dude ranch as well.  Evil scientist visit there and Gene find there is an entire world beneath the surface of the earth, called the City Of Murania.  Great action and great cliff hangers. I can imagine the suspense theater goers experienced years ago as they waited from week to week to see how Gene got out of each and every dangerous ending. Autry was just learning how to act but did a terrific job of wowing the audience inspite of it all!!! He was on the way to the Top of the B western ratings and once he got there he stayed there!!! What a cowboy!!!",1009756800,17,1012,4.25
634285,5,6303366953,"Face it. No serial has ever become more than an 11 year-old boy's greatest fantasy. From buried treasures, to evil cloaked villains, men on Mars, Emperor Ming on the planet Mongo, or an empire beneath the earth's surface,  serials engaged pre-teen boys with endless Saturday afternoon escapist  fare.
When viewed today, production standards of most serials are  ludicrous. And in general, the actors are just as ridiculous and rather  painful to listen to. In short, serials are corny, unbelievable, and very  very cheap.
But when I saw Gene Autry's 15-episode Phantom Empire in 1949  every Saturday following my swimming session at the Plainfield New Jersey  YMCA while eating an egg salad sandwich that crumbled down my shirt, I was  transported into another world that has never left me. The sheer idea of a  huge city deep under the earth's surface, the beautiful Queen Tika lording  over Murania as her evil counselors wreak havoc among the earthlings,  Frankie Darro and his Thunder Riders (pail bucket on their heads and all),  and hero Gene Autry singing through it all with his wonderful bouncy  Oklahoma cowboy singing style, was a feast for my unformed mind and heart.
Each week for 15 weeks I breathlessly waited for another chapter in the  unfolding epic. And when the final (so tragic to me then) episode ended it  all, I floated home in a reverie that no amount of play could reproduce.
The only other serials that came close were the Flash Gordon series with  Buster Crabbe, FG Conquers the Universe being the best. Others included Don  Winslow of the Navy, the Bat Man series (Dr. Daka and his hungy crocodile  in the Tunnel of Love), Tom Mix, and Rocket Man. There were so many. I mean  think about this: a fellow is flying a Ryan biplane over the desert. He  lands in the middle of nowhere, walks over to a cactus, open a secret door,  and takes out a telephone to call his boss. Now that was neat stuff!
I  can't make anyone like these things, especially if you are already grown up  and missed the serial excitement back in the pre 1950's days, But if you  have a great sense of fun, and a wide imagination that can spare the corn  from your skeptical overview, this is the one to start with.  In 1966, my  friends and I went to sit all night to watch the second entire Batman  serial. We arrived drunk and then some, and laughed our way through the  first hour so much we were rolling on the floor.
I mean at the end of  episodes, Batman is tossed off of buildings, blown uo in mines, pushed out  of planes, drowned in flooding chambers, burned in furnaces, and zapped by  power lines, but comes back each week, beer belly and all, to declare to  Robin ""Uh I thinks its time to change into our bat clothes"" and  proceed to climb into the back of his Buick convertible, which bounces up  and down during the ""change."" Glorious fun.",955411200,6,2852,4.58019801980198

634484,4,6303366953,"In an enormous cavern, thousands of feet below the surface, thrives the realm of Murania.  Having grown used to its high air pressure - due to its great depth - its citizens must don helmets equipped with extra oxygen when rising to the surface, where the queen's guard patrols - on horseback - to protect the camouflaged entrance in Thunder Valley.  When these caped horsemen charge through the valley, they make the sound of rolling thunder. . . .

As much as the Queen of Murania wishes to keep their existence a secret, her Thunder Riders have been spotted by a boy and a girl, from Autry's Radio Ranch, who think it would be a great idea to emulate what they saw and start a Junior Thunder Riders club.  Unfortunately for Queen Tika, Autry's daily radio broadcasts and vacation camp, with its increasing number of visitors, fuels her fear that her ideal world would soon be contaminated by surface people. . . .

Worse yet, five of these visitors know of the legend of Murania and its deposits of radium, an extremely valuable element worth killing for. . . .

But the worst is yet to come.  Perhaps, because Queen Tika is an absolute ruler, she has become insensitive to the harshness of her laws;  her persistence to execute even loyal subjects for failure has sown the seeds of unrest;  the rebels are plotting against her;  their weapon of surrealistic destruction is almost ready. . . .

Movie extra: ""Boots and Saddles"" (1937) - (53 minutes) - (Western-comedy) - A boy has inherited a ranch, unfortunately, he must sell it to pay its outstanding bills.

It's a mix of serial, sci-fi and western that really works - production quality is much nicer then a normal serial of that time period.  Aside from adults, there is a lot of kid oriented viewpoint in the movie (the little cowboy girl is super cute and an interesting character) ... so is something that kids as well as adults enjoy.

I've come to accept some flaws as the restoration process can be a painstaking task.  It would take a labor of love to get films such as this one to the level which we all could appreciate.  In the real world, there's a balance between quality of the restoration and the amount of money someone is willing to pay for the restoration. At some level there seems to be a compromise between both. This version is not nearly the best available copy, this one and all others will eventually be surpassed...the question is when?  If you need a better version right now...I suggest going to the Serial Squadron website and purchasing theirs!

634582,5,6303366953,"This is a review of the Timeless Media Group release of the 1935 Mascot Serial, ""The Phantom Empire.""  Empire is one of my all time favorite serials.  Given that, I fell hook, line, and sinker for this new overpriced 3 disc set from Timeless ""Authorized By The Gene Autry Estate.""

Gene Autry did not produce or own exclusive rights to this public domain serial.  This set claims to use as a source his own personal print.  For $35, I expected it to shoot the moon.  Not so fast, though.  Gene's ""personal copy"" was evidently a 16mm print, because that's what this looks to be sourced from.  No cleanup to image or sound has been done.  Dirt, scratches, and other trash are apparent throughout.  Timeless, not one of my favorite distributors (remember those great old Universal TV shows they licensed, and used horrible 16mm syndication prints as sources, e.g. Checkmate)?

I'm sure that Autry's agents forced Timeless to spread this 12-chapter serial over 3 platters to avoid over-compression, with the best possible intentions.  No restoration or cleanup has been done.  Sad.

The Serial Squadron sells a version of EMPIRE through their site, which is superior to this.  Also, VCI has their own version out that looks pretty good.  Nothing will ever be perfect for this title unless a first generation source can be found, and that's unlikely to happen.  The folks at Serial Squadron did clean up their version digitally and certainly looks the best.

So, if you have either the VCI or Serial Squadron versions, you can't do much better by them.  Timeless' price is ridiculous for what you get.  The only supplement to amount to anything is a brief intro done for Autry's Melody Ranch Theater syndicated TV show that ran his films.  It's actually an intro for an edited feature version of the serial.",1307491200,29,1802,4.823529411764706

634584,4,6303366953,"Produced at ultra low budget and breakneck pace, Phantom Empire is a fascinating hodge-podge of 1930's cross-cultural currents, and is a milestone not only for serial films, but for cinema in general. Indeed, it is so rich in ideas and Americana that this serial is virtually a celluloid time capsule.

Much invention is evident by the way Gene Autry's radio show was so prominently woven into the plot, no doubt a shrewd business move on the cowboy's part to increase his radio audience while simultaneously breaking into cinema. In particular, there is a very clever moment when Frankie Darrow, while acting in a flash-back sequence, breaks the 4th wall to speak a couple lines directly to the audience, yet stays contained within the radio drama within the serial.

Speaking of young Darrow, as well as the young actress playing his sister, Betsy King Ross: kid and adolescent characters in these kinds of things are very often cloying, annoying and corny. Yet Miss Ross and Frankie are both likable characters, and my research indicates that Miss Ross was actually a performing trick rider in her youth. Sadly, she only does one riding trick in the whole serial.

One of the most interesting aspects to this serial is the chilling resemblance of the Thunder Riders to a KKK contingent. The riders wear flowing robes, high domed headgear, and bizarre breathing masks which strangely resemble the masks worn by the earliest 19th century versions of the Klan. The Klan, which is often called 'The Invisible Empire,' purports that its duties include the protection of white females, and in this serial the riders protect the blond, Aryan-featured Queen Tika. Note that the title sequence to each chapter is overlaid with images of smoke and flame, suggestive of the burning cross. The Klan, although less popular in 1935 than at its peak in the 1920's, was still a powerful force.(Note: In case there is doubt, I am anti-KKK.)

The similarities are too many and too great to be purely coincidental, but whether the imitation was purposeful or unconscious is unknown. Likewise, it cannot be determined from this serial whether the creators admired the Klan or not.

The theme of a rural person being transported to fantastical land was revisited in 1938, in The Wizard of Oz.

The idea of blending science fiction/fantasy elements with western movie conventions, while seemingly odd, was repeated many times after this. 1949's Captain Video, for instance, contained a futuristic hero who nonetheless supervised a large number of remote 'agents,' all of whom were western heroes. And in the 1960's, the hit show 'The Wild, Wild, West' perhaps most successfully combined these elements. But again, in the early 1970's, the hit film 'West World' did this also.

In 1993, the Fox network premiered the clever but commercially unsuccessful 'Adventures of Brisco County Jr.', combining the old west with scifi. And in 1999, Will Smith attempted a remake of Wild, Wild West, which was a spectacular commercial and artistic failure.

As far as entertainment goes, this serial is worthwhile to fans of the genre and to others seeking the unusual, but the fight scenes are quite primitive, even when compared with Flash Gordon, which appeared only 1 year later.

Things move quickly, and there are unusual situations, scenes and happenings so as to keep one interested. There is an interesting bit of stage business when a character is electronically revived from the dead, and for the 1st few minutes is unable to speak his native tongue, but instead speaks in 'the Language of the Dead,' which resembles gibberish.

The special effects are better than average for 1935, particularly the miniature work, and are most likely the work of the Lydecker Bros., who went on to do legendary work for Republic Studios after this production.

Gene Autry is not muscular, nor does he project a lot of overt courage, but he is likable and within this serial he makes a decent hero. This was his 1st starring role, and after this, of course, he went on to a prosperous movie and TV career. Because he invested and ran his businesses wisely, he died one of the richest men in Hollywood in 1998, at age 91. Autry began it all by fighting a Phantom Empire, but would up with a business empire.",1276905600,,4268,4.930362116991644
634697,5,6303366953,"Singing cowboy Gene Autry (in his first starring film role) plays -- singing cowboy Gene Autry, star of a daily radio broadcast which is performed live from ""Radio Ranch."" Autry's contract, very strangely, requires that he perform in every show without fail or he will immediately and on-the-spot lose control of the program and the ranch. Yes, it's silly, but you'll soon learn to leave most of your sense of reality behind if you want to enjoy this early genre mash-up involving Autry, his two young sidekicks (Frankie Darro and Betsy King Ross, who was advertised as ""America's champion trick rider"" but gets precious little trick riding to do, alas) and their team of ""Junior Thunder Riders"" as they try to thwart both a team of evil and greedy scientists from gaining control of the ranch so that they can exploit its radium deposits, and the underground denizens of the lost city of Murania, an advanced civilization of super-science which will stop at nothing - even mass destruction - to keep the outside world from intruding.

Also making appearances are comic duo Smiley Burnett and Peter Potter, who typically have a slapstick gag or two that frequently hinders the heroes in just about every episode; most of the chapters follow a basic pattern of Gene and company getting out of trouble with either the scientists or the Muranians at the beginning of the episode, rushing back to the ranch so that Gene can make his broadcast, a song from Gene or occasionally a western combo, and after the 2nd episode, Gene trying to make sure he doesn't get caught for the murder of his sidekicks' father, his partner (he's not guilty, of course)! This one has it all folks - Laurel & Hardy-type slapstick routines, lots of great singing cowboy music, mad scientists and fantastic inventions, gunfights - one of many ways in which the whole serial seems to exist in a parallel universe can be shown by the fact that they actually stage gunfights, bank robberies etc for the radio show, despite the lack of a live audience! There's little in the way of sex in this one - this seems to be aimed at a slightly younger crowd than Flash Gordon , the next major science-fiction serial to come along a year later. The queen of Murania (Dorothy Christy) is attractive enough but quite severe and wooden; no romance between her and the 28-year-old (but rather older looking) Autry is ever on the horizon. The scenes in the Muranian city are probably the highlights overall, with some surprisingly good sets and solid painting/matte work (keep in mind this was a very low budget affair) and some pretty advanced science fiction hardware for the day - a disintegrating ray, televisors that can show events anywhere, an aerial torpedo that can be controlled in mid-flight, a super-fast elevator, etc.

The acting is almost uniformly mediocre to poor, with Wheeler Oakton as the Muranian queen's Chancellor (and ultimately traitor) probably the most memorable, though in basically a typical 30s stock-villain way; and of course it can be fairly repetitive like a lot of serials - but overall the weirdness of the thing and the willingness to just mash up all kinds of disparate elements together and hope they stick worked for me, and I'd have to say I liked this just as much, maybe a little more even, than the Flash Gordon serials of the next few years. The copy I watched is the recent VCI edition, which is not tinted unlike the alternative edition available from The Serial Squadron, but is pretty high quality in most respects, and loaded with extras. I can't recommend this too highly to those few interested in the genre.

Included as an extra on the 2nd disc of this 2-disc set, ""Boots and Saddles"" is a 53-minute B-western that is apparently typical of Autry's work after the serial for the 18 years (1935-1953) that he was a regular film actor. Autry made dozens and dozens of these short features, playing himself typically and working through plots that were probably hackneyed even then.

Gene's the foreman of a ranch named - you guessed it - Gene Autry, who happens to be - are you shocked? - just as good with a guitar and yodel as with a horse and sixgun. The ranch's owner has died and his spoiled English-raised bratty adolescent kid has come to take over, and plans to sell it. After a ride on the range with Gene though the boy changes his mind, thus putting a snag in the plans of the villain of the piece, Jim Neill (Bill Elliott) who wanted to raise horses to sell to the army. Gene decides to do the same thing himself and also runs afoul of the army colonel (Guy Usher) in charge of buying horses, and his lovely daughter (Judith Allen) who of course gets some romancin'. Some decent riding sequences, a couple of very brief and bloodless gunfights, Smiley Burnett on hand for some slapstick, and lots of songs. It moves along nicely and is competently put together, but if this in fact is one of the better Autry westerns, I probably won't be seeking out a lot of the other 90 or so out there....

All in all, though, this VCI set is remarkably fun and the genre mash-up of ""The Phantom Empire"" in some ways seems strikingly modern, almost 75 years later.  At this point, probably my favorite American serial from the classic era.",1253059200,4,5245,4.683297180043384

You get a taste of the original serial. In this case, it's the bizarre juxtaposition of a full-blown 30s sci-fi society and Gene Autry's staged wild west shows at Radio Ranch. I also like the robot garage-door opener and the barn-loft electronics laboratory for cowboy teenagers. Sometimes this movie feels like one big fever dream!

The cliffhangers are oddly unsatisfying when they're immediately resolved. It's pretty easy to spot where some of the old episode breaks were, but we jump straight ahead to the version that shows how the heroes escape seemingly certain doom.

The severely condensed plot wreaks inevitable confusion along the way and dangling threads at the end. Reducing any hours-long serial to a short movie must be a daunting task.

And there might have been some clean prints that emerged from this process, but I haven't seen one yet. In this case, some scenes are zoomed in, clipping the sides and top. Many are muddy, and the sound quality varies.

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

7844950,5,6303366953,"My main reason for adding to the glut of existing reviews of this popular serial is to note differences between the DVDs from VCI, Timeless and Grapevine.  Details below, following a short obligatory description of the serial, but the VCI, with its extra features is best for most purposes, with the Timeless being the closest to the original film.

Mascot's 12-chapter serial ""The Phantom Empire,"" released in 1935, was Gene Autry's first starring role, playing himself, broadcasting daily from Radio Ranch.  The combination of singing cowboys, evil scientists, an advanced civilisation 25,000 feet beneath the surface of the earth and kids riding ""to the rescue"" wearing buckets on their heads has been popular since its initial release, despite, or maybe because of the over-the-top acting, absurd plot and the low-cost high-tech underground city with recycled robots, radium bombs and a Disintegrating Atom-Smashing machine capable of destroying the Universe created by dressing up the studio's lighting equipment.  Unfortunately the original negatives have long been lost, and existing prints have a number of problems.

VCI's DVD edition, # 8502 (ASIN: B0011Z5NFK) is on two discs, the first double-layer,  currently supplied on ""burned"" media (DVD-R) according to their website.  The image is sharp, and most of it has adequate gray scale if contrast is a little high, and there isn't much in the way of dirt or scratches.  The sound, for a 1935 Mascot serial, is fairly good, usually free from significant distortion, though a couple reels have some high-frequency loss, flutter and minor dropouts.  Dialogue is clear enough, and there are only a few splices, though a couple minor interruptions in Autry's opening song are from video editing to remove ""blanks"" in the picture that had been added to the film to avoid such jumps in the soundtrack.  VCI is fairly conservative in most of their ""clean-up"" efforts, but they tend to overdo the ""restoration"" of the titles and chapter introductions.  While it helps identify pirated copies of their edit, the intro text gets turned into a slide-show, still frames with fake transitions between them that don't always match the originals, to ""correct"" the minor bits of dirt, scratches and wobble that make it look like part of the rest of the film.  And as with many editions of this serial, the title ""Featuring the Scientific City of Murania"" following the cast list had been spliced out of most chapters, a point at which television stations used to insert ""messages of interest and importance"" before running the chapter.  Several of the ""next week"" titles have been ""recreated"" and while the style is close, the content isn't quite right for the last chapter.  But the faults are minor; VCI's edition is very good, and as ""extras"" they include the trailer for the serial, Autry's 1937 feature ""Boots and Saddles"" and excerpts from his first film appearance in the 1934 Ken Maynard feature ""In Old Santa Fe.""  There are also two items by Clifford Weimar; a text ""Biography"" of Gene Autry, and one with background material about the serial, narrated by Jonathan Webb, which includes a before-and-after example of the restoration.  A ""Photo Gallery"" has 34 pictures, including 21 lobby cards from other Mascot serials.

The DVD set from Shout! Factory / Timeless Media (ASIN: B004WD1J6K), ""authorized by Gene Autry Entertainment"" and ""sourced from Gene Autry's personal film archive"" is supplied on three discs, but single-layer so the available space was no different than VCI's.  Timeless makes no claim of ""digital restoration,"" and the film has not been extensively ""cleaned up.""  Some minor patching was attempted; the sound for the opening credits of Chapters Two and Three was copied from Chapter One, which unfortunately has different music than the rest of the serial.  The Chapter Two title is out-of-place, directly following the main title instead of being right before the ""recap.""  More surprising is the ten-second piece gone from Gene's song in the second chapter about Pete and Oscar, given that this is the authorized edition from the Autry estate.  Still, presenting the film in a form reasonably close to the condition of the existing print preserves what authenticity it had, and in addition to including the ""Scientific City of Murania"" credit this is the only edition I've found with all the original ""next week"" titles.  The image is nearly as sharp as VCI's, sufficient to read the small letters in the opening titles, and the gray scale is better, showing a few details in the darker areas that are lost in VCI's print.  On the down side there is a little visual trash including scratches, dirt, fingerprints and, while small and fairly dim, ""Gene Autry Entertainment"" logos that pop up in the lower-right corner about every three minutes.  Overall the sound is slightly worse than VCI's with more distortion in some reels, but in Chapter Eight, Gene's song ""I'm Getting a Moon's Eye View of the World"" is free from the flutter afflicting VCI's and other editions of this serial.  Timeless includes an ""extra"" made in the 1980s for a cable channel as an introduction to the ""feature"" version of the serial, with Autry and some of his old film associates.

Grapevine's edition (ASIN: B01MG5C1NA) is on two single-layer DVD-R discs, lacking any ""extra"" features.  There are a few more scratches than the Timeless DVD has, but most of it is failry clean and there are no pop-up logos.  Unfortunately the image isn't very sharp, worst in Chapters Three, Four and Nine, and the image is a little oversize in Chapter Eight where the bottom line of the intro text goes off-screen.  Highlights are kept under control and only occasionally does the image burn out, but some chapters have a slight murkiness so there isn't much advantage over VCI's in the darker areas.  Only about half the chapters have the ""Scientific City of Murania"" credit and several of the ""next week"" titles have been ""recreated"" by replacing the title in a frame from another such title, made obvious by the sharpness of the new lettering.  The ""blanks"" are present in the first chapter, avoiding the minor glitches in the sound heard in VCI's edition, but unfortunately there is a splice in another part of the song.  Title music for Chapter One has been replaced with that from the later chapters, clashing at the chapter title.  Sound is decent in most chapters, though there is quite a bit of distortion in a couple of the opening titles.  Most chapters run a few seconds longer than those on VCI's DVD, though I don't think the difference is significant for the content.

The VCI edition has the most going for it of these three, carefully transferred and with good extra features.  My favorite is the Timeless DVD for its better gray scale and less ""meddling"" with the credits, a good alternative when found at a competitive price, though it was originally expensive.  Either of these deserves a five-star ""I Love It"" rating.  Grapevine's seems to have few advantages, with the lack of sharpness a major drawback, though like the Timeless it avoids the excesses of ""restoration"" in the chapter recaps.  But as with any serial, don't try to watch it without a day or so between chapters, to preserve the effect of the cliffhangers, regardless of how silly they are in this example of the art form.",1504396800,6,7350,4.987714987714988

There's sort of two things to review with these collections.  The media or creation of the discs and the actual show or content.  The presentation and packaging is good.  The print of the content is usually good as well; a surprise considering the age of the show.  There were no episodes where we thought ""this is a bad print"".

Our kids loved the old Flash Gordon serials so we thought this was a good similar set.  Some of the reviews indicated this was the ""best serial"" so we got it.  While not a disappointment it just never clicked with the family.  It was hard to credibly mix the cowboys and the underworld people.  The kids sort of liked it but it never was an excitement like with Flash.  They always wanted the next episode of Flash.  This was a take it or leave it.  I have to confess we didn't actually make it to watch every episode - we lost interest.

We're still Autry fans but this was just an odd vehicle for him.",1472083200,,1124,5.005405405405406
