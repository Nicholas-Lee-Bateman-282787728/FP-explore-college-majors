8324220,1,B000621P8I,"When i saw this ""movie""(Witch thank God was on my TV)it bored my tarrible. Why didn't Disney just say:Duh lets make a ""movie"" that will bore and dissipoint people so much thay want to puke!

When thay said ""Bust a Moo!"" i think thay were saying ""Bust a Moovie!"" i mean normaly i like funny movies but this was...I don't know what it was. The music was bad the vioces were bad the whole stinken story was BAD.It does not say anything about the carcters(If thats what you want to call them thay were more like props to me)in 3 seconds thay accept the fat brown cow in 5 seconds thay burst into song in 7 seconds there going to take the farm in 10 seconds the cows have gone there differnet ways.

the music forgettible(Witch is odd because i like Bonnie raitt)

the ""Props"" even more forrgetible the jokes forrgetible the plot is just lousy. I can only remeber one joke and it was a long skinny ""hippie cow"" singing so bad it will make you puke.

If you want a good ""moovie""(Pardon the pun)buy madagascar.",1136073600,3,1003,4.347593582887701
