8222833,1,B000WDTO4S,"Sadly I can not say anything about the series itself, because I'm unable to playback the DVDs on my equipment.

While the amazon.com description states 'Region All' according to the Box Set's backside. The discs inside the box are actually all 'Region 1' and can not be played outside of the U.S. w/o special equipment (region-free DVD players or computers with special software).",1224288000,2,380,5.031746031746032
8222834,5,B000WDTO4S,"This is a multilevel, multifaceted tale of courage and honor in the face of almost inconceivable treachery.  The scope of the story is certainly Shakespearean in breadth as well as in its characterization.  If the ""good guys"" are a little too good at times, the ""bad guys"" are really bad!  One of them could easily be a stand-in for Iago in ""Othello.""  This series is well worth the money and the time.",1216252800,6,402,4.541666666666667
8222835,2,B000WDTO4S,"I would not recommend this movie at all. First of all, the theme is just the very old revenge clash with love type, like all of Kim Yong's fictions. This is among one of the unsuccessful Kim Yong stories. The best would probably be Condor Hero and Return of the Condor Heros. Book and Sword is good too. As for the TV series making, it's made for the naive audience. Even my mom laughed at the silly plots, so many flaws to the logic of the story line.",1203120000,2,452,4.1477272727272725
