2710220,3,B000B8GTCE,"Ok, folks! Here it is! The second release of One-Armed Swordsmen

by video asia! But is this release any good??? Well let me tell

you, there are changes! Yes! Remember the last One Armed

Swordsmen had this problem where the film will play 12 mintues

in then the movie would skip to the instant action thing! Well,

all I can say is that they DID fixed that problem! BUT DON'T GET

HAPPY, yet! Just when you thought things could get better, they

tend to get worst! Ever have that problem where a DVD is

defective and these blocky images appear on the screen and the

film pauses!? Well this movie certainly has that but there is a

difference! The DVD doesn't pause, but blocky images appear but

get this, there's nothing wrong with the DVD! The blocks are

imbedded! SO HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY! Good news on that is appears

once every like 2 to 4 minutes at a time! It's not a complete

wreck, just wish they can fix that problem! Other problem is

they cut the first 3 and a quarter minutes of the film off and

cut right to the graveyard scene! So you miss the credits (Jimmy

Wang Yu and David Chiang both star and directed this film along

with Lo Lieh)and whatever!

This package comes with One-Armed vs. 9 Killers which is the

same as their previous release (read my review on it)! extras

include interviews with Phillip Ko and Jimmy Wang Yu and a

really awsome behind the scenes making of a kung fu film

documentry called Fist of Fire with David Chiang (one would

assume)!",1148860800,4,1485,4.394833948339484
