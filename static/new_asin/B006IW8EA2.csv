4991865,4,B006IW8EA2,"Christian Bale stars as John Miller, a mortician on his way to Winchester Cathedral in the middle of war torn Nanking 1937 to bury a priest. The Japanese are taking control of the city. As a westerner Miller is allowed some leeway. When he gets to the church, he discovers they have no money to pay him. There is a group of a dozen girl students who want out. While he is trying to sort things out, a group of local prostitutes arrive seeking refuge from the war.

John Miller immediately shows us his bad side. In addition to the conflict between the Japanese and Chinese, the students don't want the working girls there. The working girls want out of Nanking too and promise John ""unimaginable pleasures"" from all of them for safe passage.

Eventually, Miller dons a priest cloak and goes from zero to hero as he works relentlessly to save the girls. It is a story which shows how the least of us become heroes.

Much of the movie is in English, the rest has subtitles. There is some first person narration by one of the students. I thought the oriental actors did a better job than Christian Bale who reminded me too much of Jeff Bridges. Chinese actress Ni Ni as Yu Mo gave us a good performance.

There are war scenes, killing, and a few rape scenes, although this is not a grindhouse exploitation film. No nudity, some f-bombs lobbed in Chinese.  The film, as expected, has its emotional ups and downs.",1325894400,,1408,4.484375

4991915,5,B006IW8EA2,"The Flowers or War is based on the fiction novella by Geling Yan who was inspired after reading real diary records written during occupation by Minnie Vautrin, an American missionary who ran a college in Nanjing about what went on in the city during that time. This has elements that parallel Hollywood overthetopness such as lone Chinese soldier taking out a large number of enemy on his own, but at its central storyline, it's realistic enough that you actually care about and are moved by what happens.

Japan invades China in 1937.  Christian Bale, a mortician, is a white guy and apparently the Japanese didn't kill Westerners so he can move around the city of Nanking somewhat safely.  The priest at an orphanage for girls owes him money so he goes there to collect only to find that guy is dead and it is now run by a young boy.  He decides to stay there since the beds are more comfortable than what he has slept in lately and there's wine to get drunk on until the boy can scrape up the money he's owed. He's quite happy when some prostitutes from the red light district invade the mansion.  But while the prostitutes hide in the basement when the Japanese turn up and start raping and killing the girls, wearing a priest's dress since that's what he passed out while drunk wearing, he is awakened by the screams and pretends to be the priest to get them to stop. Doesn't work but luckily a Chinese sniper draws them out.  Later the higher ranked Japanese army officials have arrived. They have apologised for the behaviour of the men, have posted guards outside the orphanage to guard them, but want the girls to come as guests to their victory party for taking the city.  Bale's character knows what that means, as do the prostitutes. They will have to come up with a plan to save the girls.

The movie has different languages spoken at times, Mandarin mostly, but also Japanese and English.  English subtitles when the other two languages are spoken..",1506556800,,1963,4.6017191977077365
4991916,4,B006IW8EA2,"This film was far more dramatic and of a higher quality than I had expected. It is set in Nanking in 1937 when the city was being overrun by Japanese forces. The chaos of war forces a variety of random characters to seek refuge in a Christian girl's school, but being a movie there is only so much time to explain details, so a lot of inferences and assumptions are formed. Despite the haphazard manner in which the characters meet, they flesh out a great drama set around the girl's school. Without having an elaborate backstory the characters come to life as they come out of their shells and bond in a time of crisis. All of the characters create a meaningful, dramatic story and there are certainly no small parts in this film. Thee is a small amount of action at the beginning that is intense but this is not a classic 'war movie' and despite there being a language barrier between 3 different peoples, you don't feel like you have to read the movie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Flowers-Of-War/dp/B008Y6UHEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Flowers Of War</a>",1505001600,3,1113,5.1208791208791204

Not enough adjectives to describe why this is such a stellar example of the acting craft (let alone the tremendous film making effort behind the scenes).  Being based whole or part on a true story makes it all the more enjoyable. Without going to far a stream -  the inhumanity and compassion of love capability in our humanity could not have been more artfully displayed than in this subject matter.  If you want quality entertainment (?),  then for sure this is one of the few examples where you can find it.

4991979,4,B006IW8EA2,"Basically a revamping of the John Rabe story: expat Westerner helps Chinese civilians endure and escape Japanese atrocities in occupied city - Nanking in this case.  Its storyline is somewhat predictable: the drunken rake redeemed by his imposture of a priest, the harlot transformed by her Christ-like sacrifice for the innocent.  And yet for all the criticism, it works in making a visually authentic and harrowing film that pulls no punches in its depiction of war or the perimeters of the soul.  Even the Japanese are humanized, which is remarkable in a Chinese-made war movie.  While the scenes could have been ""tightened"" one doesn't really mind the leisurely, sensual pace of the film, with its strong personal chemistry intermixed with graphic combat action.  Definitely worth a second viewing.",1472515200,,802,5.234375

4991984,5,B006IW8EA2,"Flowers of War is about sacrifice, judgement and love.  It is inspired by a true story set in Nanking (aka Nanjing), China, in 1937.  John Miller/Father John (played Christian Bale),is a mortician, that goes to a Catholic convent to perform a burial on the priest.  When he arrives at the convent he discovers that the priest had been disposed of due to the stench of his body just sitting.  Now Miller wants to leave the convent because the area is in a war, Japan has invaded China.  The Nanking Massacre is taking place, where over 40,000 civilians were raped, murdered and possessions taken, Miller must get out of the church and Nanking but he cant.  Thirteen girls and their ward that ran into the safety of the church for protection against the war is now living there.  Miller is asked by the ward to take the girls out of Nanking to safety.  Later, twelve prostitutes of the Qinhuai River surfaces at the church for protection as well then everything changes.

4991986,1,B006IW8EA2,"The Flowers of War was a much-anticipated epic film treatment of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, which starred Christian Bale. As a longtime professor in Hong Kong, I have been to Nanjing and the museum there dedicated to the massacre and know the history quite well. Yet I still found The Flowers of War to be confusing and hard to follow, even knowing the event and key participants as well as I do. This film was at best a series of scenes strung together with little continuity (apart from their occurrence during the battle / massacre). If you do not know the history already you will not learn it at all from this film. This is not because the film was inaccurate, it is because characters (such as some of the European healthcare workers, missionaries and students) pop in and out of the film in rapid order with little explanation. For example, early in the film the Chinese militia fighting in the city suddenly met up with a fully equipped unit of (apparently) regular soldiers. Who was this unit? Japanese, Chinese (it was hard to tell at first from a distance on the movie screen, though obviously Chinese as the two groups started talking). Why were the regular army soldiers suddenly leaving the capital (Nanjing) in the face of the enemy? The audience is not told (Chiang was pulling his regular units out of Nanjing, leaving the capital to the Japanese, but the audience is not told -- as is common in this film, nothing is explained). This poor narrative pattern continued over and over -- the film needed more continuity of character. This film reminds me of the many, many so-so manuscripts I have to review as an editor for Academic management and international business journals. To draw comparisons with the movie, those problem papers often have some good writing (like good cinematography for this movie), good data (good special effects), and several good sections (good scenes, as this film had), but poor story-telling, that is, a series of poorly-connected topics and no real theme or contiguous characters to follow through the movie. Again, if you do not already know this painful event well, you will find it very difficult to follow this confusing movie. A bunch of loosely connected scenes all thrown together does not make a good film no matter how good the special effects are and the acting is. The movie did very poorly in North America and I was not surprised; the interviews I saw depicted how North American theatre goers could not follow the story and did not understand what was going on. I hope a good film of this terrible event will be someday made. The Flowers of War was most certainly not it. A deeply disappointing film.",1466294400,3,2664,4.743534482758621

4991999,5,B006IW8EA2,"This is an incredible, very powerful movie, inspired by true events during the Japanese occupation of China. Set in the beginning days of Japan's brutal ""Rape of Nanking,"" this movie tells the story of a group of teenage convent girls trying to hide from Japanese occupation forces, along with a group of high class prostitutes who also take refuge in the convent. The group's leader is an American mortician who initially takes refuge in the convent to steal the money and wine.

This movie brilliantly develops the characters of the woman leading the prostitutes and the American, along with a poignant love affair. Based on several other Chinese-made movies I've seen, about the Rape of Nanking, this movie explicitly and honestly shows the brutality of Japanese occupiers and the horrors of that war.

The ending is both beautiful and sad, even haunting, showing the characters displaying great courage even at cost of their own lives.",1463961600,5,939,5.051612903225807

I would not have missed this for anything.",1461974400,2,325,4.344262295081967
4992004,3,B006IW8EA2,"The street combat scenes are generally well-filmed, perhaps with a little too much exaggeration.  Frankly, the Special Features section of the dvd, showing the rehearsals and technical aspects of the filming behind-the-scenes, was more interesting than the film itself.  The acting by the Chinese ladies, nearly all ""new-comers,"" is the best part of it.  The main theme is a very old one, that women who have already worked in the oldest profession are offered up to save chaste girls.  That likely happened all over the Greater East-Asia Co-prosperity Sphere when the Japanese troops came to town.  (That is also the same reason, for example, that the Japanese set up regulated brothels in Japan immediately after the WWII surrender in 1945, to channel the mass of incoming American occupation troops away from the ""good girls."")

I was very glad to have already done considerable research on the true history of the Nanjing Massacre, from historical sources and not from fictional films.  This film will not shed much light for you on what actually occurred there.  (Iris Chang's book ""The Rape of Nanking"" is highly recommended.)

The worst part was Christian Bale in the role of an American mortician.  He seems a particularly bad choice in the casting, and is never convincing as a 1930's era businessman or expat.  The scriptwriter can also take a major part of the blame, because the lines sound like flippant street English from the 1990's and not the way men talked in 1937.  Some of the idioms and slang expressions were not likely even around in the 1930's.  The verbal delivery and gravitas style of the Western businessmen of that era (as you can watch in real, original films and is also conveyed in diaries and personal accounts) was entirely different than portrayed by Bale in this film.

Instead of or in addition to this one, I would recommend the film ""John Rabe"" on the true story of the Third Reich businessman in Nanjing during the Massacre.",1461542400,2,1964,4.8942598187311175
