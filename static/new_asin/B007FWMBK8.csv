The inside is all black without episode list. Very, very poor quality, I am very disappointed. It looks like a knock off. There's no music or animation when first starting the dvds. I would return it except I want to watch the show. I'll buy a real copy if they make one.",1332720000,14,434,4.178571428571429

5083924,4,B007FWMBK8,"Volume 7 begins with Amy moving in with Ricky and the remaining senior year of Ricky, Adrian, and Jack.  During these last few months Amy and Ricky learn the ups and downs of learning to live with someone else and juggling parenting, school, and work.  The acting in this volume is the best, and the storyline is mainly about Ricky and Amy and, of course, Ben and Adrianne dealing with losing a baby.  This  would have been the volume to end the Secrets because after this volume the series falls apart because of too many other subplots.  I recommend it even though the packaging is not like the others.",1391990400,,604,4.504587155963303

I recieved my first dvd in the mail and was so excitied to watch it, I found out it skipped a lot. This is a moment where I want to brag on how great the customer service is! I contacted customer service through the online chat box and told the representative my issue and she easily,with great kindness, was able to take care of my problem and sent me a new dvd within 2 days! I sent my old dvd back and I am super pleased with how the situation was handled! My new dvd is in perfect condition and I am able to add it to my season series collection.

5083967,1,B007FWMBK8,"Okay to start I gave this volume only one star because of the quality of the product. The disc's do what they should and well. Yet everything was done very cheaply comparded to all the other volumes they have out. The Cover art looks like someone printed it off of a computer on regular paper. Its its a bit blury as well, including the art on the disc's. There is very little information on the back of the cover art and there is no disc list inside of the case either. So you have no episode guide like the other volumes and there is no sound when the disc starts its just a quite main frame.. To me this just bothers me I have all of the volumes and there all nice and this just looks like crap and like they tryed very hard to save money and be cheap on this one.",1339804800,9,767,4.019607843137255

I'm thrilled that Amazon released this when ABC Family didn't want to. I hope they continue doing it for the rest of show if ABC Family keeps refusing. Besides, you're paying half the cost of the other seasons upon release. What's the big deal? Your other alternative is watching it on Netflix, that isn't any better.

While I thank AMAZON for releasing this volume when others wouldn't, I had hoped that they could have put more time and effort into their product. These were practically a cheap imitation. They had been burnt, not pressed so the picture and sound qulity was poor. There were ads halfway through each episode. he packaging was poor, it looked very homemade and badly done. Some of the scenes would skip or it would skip over an entire episode. This is just truly disappointing. I will buy again if done more professionally but before then it is not worth the time or the money.",1337558400,16,718,4.488549618320611

I ordered this the day it was first available and it shipped within a few days! I have no problems with it. It has 3 disks like all the other seasons. They have one of the inserts so that your disks are not stacked and won't get scratched. One thing that some reviewers didn't like is the fact that the menu doesn't have sound. It didn't bother me tho. The price is right and it is of good quality!,1335139200,3,552,3.981981981981982

5083986,1,B007FWMBK8,I'm from the UK and bought this DVD as love the series. I used the link on ABC Family's website to buy the box set and very disappointed that ABC putting out this terrible copy of there much loved series. I am returning my copy and will wait for a better version to come out. After 7 DVDS you would think they would keep the series DVD appearances the same and up to scratch?

5083988,4,B007FWMBK8,"Look, the bottom line is: the earlier volumes weren't making enough money for the studio. So instead of producing thousands of DVD sets, they went the DVD-R route through CreateSpace. Now they won't get stuck with any costly overstock. And the consumer saves a little money with a more economically priced set. And for the record, Amazon clearly states in their description what kind of product this is - a DVD-R and not a regular DVD - in case anyone didn't notice.

The audio/video quality is not a problem at all. They are enhanced for widescreen TVs, the picture is sharp, the colors are exactly as vivid as they have been on previous releases. The sound is loud and clear, no distortion, no problems at all.

Yes, the artwork/packaging is basic. No cardboard slipcase this time (is that really a bad thing?). Simple cover art, but hey they even put a different picture on each DVD-R. Yes, even though these are DVD-Rs, produced ""on demand"" (in other words, only when someone orders it), they have full-color artwork and barcodes on each disc. As someone pointed out, the third disc IS mislabeled as containing episodes ""9-12"" but I have the set and can confirm that the disc contains episodes 9-13. There are no extra features, but let's be honest: the few extra features found on volumes 1-6 pretty much sucked anyway.

In other words - these are totally legit releases from ABC Family that happen to be produced by Amazon's CreateSpace. We fans of the show are actually very lucky to have these, because without the ability to put this set out as a DVD-R set it would have never even been available. There isn't a ""better"" version coming later, either. If you want these 13 episodes, this is the only way to get them.

My only real complaint is that this time around they chose to include a PSA advising kids to talk to their parents about sex in every single episode. This is an annoyance, especially since I think there are only three of them that keep rotating. These brief PSAs should have been included - if at all - as an ""extra feature"" or only show at the end of the episode instead of right smack dab in the middle.

If you like the show, you'll want to add Volume 7 to your collection. Not buying it out of some misguided attempt at ""protest"" isn't going to suddenly make Disney bring out a costlier version! Use common sense here and it will be obvious that this release is really geared toward fans.

EDIT: I read the person's review who pointed out there are no subtitles on this release, as there were with previous releases. I agree this is an unfortunate oversight and one example of where this release falls short of previous volumes.",1333929600,6,2658,4.585263157894737
5083989,4,B007FWMBK8,"Many of you guys are talking about how amazon did a bad job with this release, but I think we should be thanking amazon for releasing these episodes. When i got in touch with the company that manufactured the first six volumes, they told me they were no longer going to release future volumes because of poor sales and I think we should thank amazon for releasing it. Even though the physical quality of the dvd may suck, at least we get the episodes on dvd. Now, regarding the complaints about the video quality, I ordered my copy on march 24 and didn't ship till like a week and a half later and it was worth the wait because the reason why it took so long was because amazon was working on improving the dvd quality and i gotta say they did a great job. Video is in widescreen as it should be. For those of you that are saying that you are gonna wait and buy it when its officialy released, don't because that day will NEVER come, when a tv show gets a release on the createspace program its beacuse no one else is interested in releasing it, so please buy it so we can get the rest of the series on dvd. I think amazon could've put just a bit of more effort into it but hey, as long as we get the episodes on dvd then thats good enough. Another positive thing about this is that it only costs 14.99 and the first 6 volumes cost from 29.99 to 39.99 and now we're gonna pay half price which i think you will all agree with me is a good thing. personally, I love Amazon.com for releasing this dvd and hope they can release future volumes and eventually the rest of the series. Hope i convinced you to buy this. Thanks for reading!",1333843200,79,1631,4.1645569620253164
5083990,5,B007FWMBK8,"I just wanted to say thank you to Amazon for making it possible for us to be able to have volume 7 as it is not, and will not be distributed  in stores for us to buy. I've seen people on here complain that there is no music at the menu screen. Personally, I'm happy for that. As much as I love this show, the music over and over again gets annoying. People have complained about the quality. Honestly, it looks as good as it did when I watched it on TV every week. And for those of you who complain about that, or anything else, at least you have the option to be able to own volume 7. Unless your disks are scratched up, case is broken, or something equivalent to not being able to play your show, or keep the disks protected, you really should just be grateful you're able to have the volume! So, here's a big thank you to Amazon for making it possible for us to have volume 7!! Please make the 8 volume to complete the series!! I'd buy it in a heartbeat!!",1333238400,2,958,4.068783068783069

They did such a horrible job advertising the fact and then they have the nerve to release the DVDs in such a ""bad"" format,  what nerve.

I like the idea of getting rare shows on DVD which is what this program was designed for, but when I buy a new set, I expect it to be a quality product.  ABC Family had better get it act together and release it in a proper format and fire the person who got payed off for this idea!",1333238400,4,577,3.888888888888889
