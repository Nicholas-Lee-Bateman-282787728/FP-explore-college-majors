7420550,3,B014QDH1LC,"This isn't a bad doc, but as a longtime fan, I was hoping the focus would stick closer to the films themselves. The project feels like a love letter to the BTTF fan community more than anything else. The parts that highlight the films come off as perfunctory and very 'been there done that.' Then the focus shifts to the fans and it felt like the producers were finally exploring what mattered to them. It seems like such an incredibly wasted opportunity to have all of these people from the BTTF films on camera for new interviews, and mostly it felt like wasted air. I just got through watching this and my main memories that stick are watching and listening to fans gush on and on endlessly about how the films affected their lives. If that's your thing, this is the doc for you. It feels like an added value DVD feature I'd probably skip over. I adore the films, I'm basically happy I watched this, but I can't imagine ever wanting to see it again.",1445644800,25,952,4.4147727272727275
7420551,3,B014QDH1LC,"Got a chance to stream this on Netflix. I'm glad I did. It was more a retrospective on how the film impacted the fans who grew up with the Franchise. Which I'd be fine with if only that took up say 5 minutes of the documentary. As a back to the future fan, I want to see the Eric Stolz footage! I want the final reason on camera with Bob Gale and Crispin Glover why his character was virtually written out of the sequels. Honestly, the modern interviews I found of Lea Thompson online via youtube provided more insight to what it was like being on set during production of the movie. Which is what I thought this documentary was gonna go into more depth on then the previous home releases have done.",1445472000,17,699,4.2631578947368425

7420556,5,B014QDH1LC,"Love this documentary....but I'm a little biased, as my daughter's show choir is featured singing their ""BTTF"" themed show from 2014.  My lucky daughter played ""Lorriane"".  This documentary follows the movie's fandom that has grown as the years go by.  There are great interviews with many of the cast as well as creators of the movies.",1456704000,,336,4.964285714285714

7420561,5,B014QDH1LC,"I felt obliged to write a review as I've viewed this tremendous documentary and bonus features a half dozen times and LOVE IT. I also noted the very low rated reviews and wanted to offer balance.  The notion that this is a ""fanboy"" documentary is not correct.  If you want to watch a documentary about a fan base they exist... the Rick Springfield documentary is a perfect example.  I love documentaries and am very picky, this is one of my favorites regarding a film.  I believe the director struck the perfect balance between factual interviews with the participants who created the trilogy, and fans who help continue the legacy in many ways. They got ALL the big stars and behind the scenes folks to participate and does Michael J Fox impress me with his spirit and willingness to participate, YES!  The quality of the project is first class as well, the interviews are all lit brilliantly and artistically and that I can not say for most docs. This is really a first class production and  deserves a high rating for content and production value.  To repeat myself, to call this a video for the fans by the fans is ridiculous, the  people interviewed who actually created the trilogy in front of and behind the camera heavily dominate the proceedings and the interviews with others only serve to bring in delicious added ingredients to the mix... Highly Recommended to fans of the films and fans of film in general.",1451952000,,1419,4.693548387096774
7420562,1,B014QDH1LC,"There was huge hype for this film and I followed it and bought into it... boy was I disappointed...Despite a good start that sets you up thinking the film will be divided into many major sections, that ends quickly and gets off track by exploring those who's lives essentially revolve around BTTF. A few tid-bits here and there from Bob Gale and M. Fox are welcome and nice additions, but a miniature golf course in someones back yard? Weakly tied in.

At one point, I seriously thought we were watching the popular satire film ""Best in Show""... you'll know the moment...
You have 1.5 hours of your life you don't need today? Are you a BTTF fan? Do you like using the FF button? Then knock your socks off and watch it... otherwise, just watch the original trilogy.",1451347200,5,764,4.536231884057971

7420567,1,B014QDH1LC,"I thought I was getting a documentary that focused on the making of the films. with lots of great interviews with the stars.  instead, I got a documentary focused on the uber famous fans that are able to work with the stars.  It felt more like an advertisement for their products than a documentary for back to the future. I started to get worried about this thing when I saw the creators of this film host a VERY weird New York Comic Con panel. one of them didn't even know James Tolken was still alive.  I mean, come on. Are they even fans?  or did they just get assigned this and got told 'do as good a job as possible?'  aahhh, millenials....young kids who don't know better...

And what the hell was that rick and morty guy doing in there?  no reason at all for him to be in it, let alone show clips from rick and morty.  who says BTTF 2 and 3 suck on a documentary honoring the trilogy?  I mean,come ON!",1447891200,7,909,4.17816091954023
7420568,5,B014QDH1LC,"Great Documentary for the 30th Anniversary. It really gets you into the spirit of what the movies are and how good they have made millions of people feel for so many years. I only wish they could have interviewed Crispin Glover, Tom Wilson, and Eric Stoltz! that would have made it even better!",1446681600,,294,4.566037735849057
7420569,1,B014QDH1LC,Everyone who supported this documentary on Kickstarter should be refunded their pledge. This wasn't a true documentary in the sense but more a perspective on how it changed fans lives. Like many I was looking forward to more of a behind-the-scenes account but this wasn't it. Worth viewing on Netflix but I would never buy this.,1446595200,7,328,4.875

7420571,2,B014QDH1LC,Slow and boring.  Nothing special.  All talking heads.  Never thought that movie was that terrific.,1445644800,2,99,5.466666666666667
8731593,1,B014QDH1LC,"From the trailer, I was expecting this to be a true documentary for BTTF the way that ""Empire Of Dreams"" was for Star Wars. Well, the trailer is very misleading, because this documentary is nothing like that. There are way too many interviews with people who had nothing to do with the film and not enough interview material with the cast members and creators. There's too much content on BTTF fandom and not nearly enough on the actual making of the film. Most of the non-cast/crew interviews were quite boring and the documentary as a whole was very disappointing. BTTF is a great film and deserves a far better documentary than this. It would be great if the same people who made ""Empire Of Dreams"" could do a proper documentary for BTTF's 35th or 40th anniversary.",1506211200,,768,4.654411764705882
8731594,5,B014QDH1LC,"Have written about BTTF for publication, been obsessed with the movie since I was a kid, and still learned a lot of stuff I never knew about the making of the film. Expertly done.",1498262400,,179,4.294117647058823
8731595,4,B014QDH1LC,"The trilogy of films BACK TO THE FUTURE 1-3 have captured the love and admiration of a generation. It was the perfect combination of writing, directing and acting that brought to life the tale of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a 17 year old high school student who gets caught up in traveling back in time in his friend Dr. Emmett Browns (Christopher Lloyd) time machine, a hopped up DeLorean. He ends up meeting his parents in their high school years as well and comedic results follow.

One of the things found in the series of films, in particular the second where they went into the future, was predicting what the world would be like in 2016. So as the year arrives many have wondered what did and did not occur in those predictions. It garnered a new interest in the films for many who remembered them fondly and a new generation that wondered what the allure was. In short, a new interest in a classic set of films that hold up today as much as they did during their initial releases.

So its no surprise that a documentary about the films has been in the works for some time and now arrives on that well known year. BACK IN TIME gives us a look back at the original films along with interviews with those involved in the making of the movies as well as the lives of the fans that it touched. In so doing the homage gives us a chance to reminisce and to discover just how deep the world of fandom goes when it comes to movies.

One would expect to find glowing memories coming from those behind the scenes. For Fox it was the movie that catapulted him from TV series star to mega-movie box office success. Lloyd did much the same having gotten his first major notice in the series TAXI. Director Robert Zemekis cemented his standing in Hollywood with this film, a follow up to his successful ROMANCING THE STONE. Any documentary about these films would have to include all of them and they do so here, showing not only how the films were made but how grateful all involved were for the opportunities it provided them.

What makes this film a bit different than the standard documentary on these movies is the look at the fandom that surrounds it. There are people who have recreated replicas of the car that was the time machine in the film. There are others who dress as the characters they love when they gather together for various events and conventions. None of these seems too over the top infatuated with the film but there is definitely a love affair with the movie going on here.

The few complaints of those who didn't seem to enjoy this documentary revolve around the disjointed way in which the story is told at times. I found that to be on the plus side. When you gather together with friends to discuss a movie or an event it is rare that you do so in a straight timeline. You talk about one item and that reminds you of another so you discuss that topic and then maybe return to the initial subject. This film is like that, as if you're sitting with a friend talking about these great movies going back and forth and bringing back the excitement they instilled in you at the time. Its comfortable feeling.

Documentaries about movies should have that sense of wonder and appreciation rather than being made as if the topic at hand were as important as say the rise and fall of the Third Reich. Those fact based documentaries are about things that will change the world and the history of it. Documentaries on movies are about those things that may have changed a few lives personally but not the history of the world. They are the things that dreams are made of, things that might inspire but that don't actually make it happen.

This film is a love story to all of those who found the original films to be fantastic. It is a documentary that will inspire some to seek out the original three movies and to watch them. It will renew interest in movies that were a part of their time, which captured the imagination of a generation. Thats a good thing. To get young people to discover something great from the past is something that needs to happen more often. Lets just hope it doesnt inspire Hollywood to place this on their far too lengthy list of past hits they think need remade. A must see for fans of the films.",1487376000,2,4237,4.424358974358975
8731596,2,B014QDH1LC,"Like another reviewer titled 'About fan culture'. Very disappointed.
Some interesting moments - yet - like a gentleman in a wheelchair has been inspired by Michael J. Fox,
That is Great and he's done wonderful things with his life - yet has Nothing to do with 'Back to the future'.
A lot of 'wasted Time' on fans who are so obsessed they bought and converted some Delorean's into 'time machines'.
Okay - kinda fun - but these people talk As If these cars are Really time machines.
The cover and title lead me to think this would be Much More.
Oh - and there is or was a music group based on this movie. After seeing them on here - I know NOT to see them in person.
Wish I could have an 'Edited' copy - without all the ffuff and wasted Time. Scott M.",1486339200,,749,4.172413793103448
