7269479,4,B00YYOFMMY,"Saw the original as a young child, really liked the new version, so being able to purchase them together was a bonus.  And I did like the new live people version so much more than I expected I would.  Not quite as charming as Frozen, but still charming!",1466121600,,253,4.25

7269481,5,B00YYOFMMY,"Absolutely enchanting is an understatement. I have loved the Disney original cartoon version since I can remember and had high hopes for the live-action version. As soon as I received the pack, I immediately watched the 2015 movie and fell in love all over again! Getting a more in depth look at the Prince and the Prince and Cinderella's budding relationship is such a delight! Completely worth every penny and every second of watching over and over again!",1454889600,,457,4.871794871794871
7269482,5,B00YYOFMMY,"This is a great combo pack! Much cheaper than purchasing them individually. Plus, there are behind-the-scenes videos for the 1950 version! I always like to learn what went into the making of a movie, and it's rare to get an inside look to older movies. Also, it's ""region-free"" which means it will play anywhere, even though the title says ""UK"".",1452211200,18,345,4.766666666666667
7269483,5,B00YYOFMMY,This was a great deal. We enjoy both movies AND the extra shorts that come with them - Frozen Fever and Tangled Ever After!,1522108800,,123,4.166666666666667

7269485,1,B00YYOFMMY,Horrible experience - received item for daughters birthday.  When we went to our lay it did not work - both discs would not play.  We friend multiple dvd players - none worked.

7269490,5,B00YYOFMMY,"Loved the cartoon version but again I saw that as a kid. The live action version had some great points. Telling the story of Cinderella and how she got to where she was etc.. Parts of it, as with most live action remakes of cartoons, were real real cheesy. In some cases went way over the top. I did find it interesting that all the animals were real and had been trained for their specific roles, even the mice.",1517356800,,412,4.227848101265823

7269498,5,B00YYOFMMY,"I only wanted the animated version, but this combo package was less expensive that the animated version by itself. I really enjoyed both versions. I have most of the animated Disney classics, and this is a nice addition. The live action remake is just excellent.",1497830400,2,262,4.844444444444444
7269499,5,B00YYOFMMY,"Love this duo! This story makes me so sentimental. I LOVE all the special features on both discs; there are some great behind-the-scenes featurettes for both productions. These discs didn't work with my regular DVD player, but they work fine with my Blu-ray player. If you can nab a copy of this before they sell out, DO IT.",1497398400,2,324,4.603448275862069

After finished watching it, I checked on bonus features but I am disappointed to discover those have no English subtitles.  And after I watched Lily James's movie, Cinderella, I am glad those bonus features have English subtitles in it.

7269523,5,B00YYOFMMY,Its from the UK but the description stated the dvds are region free. Both discs DID play on my U.S blu ray player. The description doesnt say but its two separate movies in a box set. Just what I wanted instead of one disc holding 2 movies. Great price too!,1484697600,15,257,4.16

7269525,1,B00YYOFMMY,So sad that I could not play this in my U.S. DVD players.

7269527,1,B00YYOFMMY,"Do NOT order this! It will not play on DVD players in USA! I quickly was ordering gifts and this was a DVD I was looking for and it's listed as a ""DVD"", so didn't read all the details and ordered.  I thought all DVDs were the same and learned hard way that's not the case. Amazon and merchants need to have a separate category for other country DVDs which do not work in USA, like ""DVD-Europe Only"" in heading so it's clearer!!!! This company wouldn't give me my money back after I contacted them...scoundrels!",1482192000,16,510,4.368421052631579

8719353,1,B00YYOFMMY,It will not play on any DVD or blu-ray player. The entire thing is worthless. Asked for a refund and was told it was past the return date. I got this for my daughters birthday and didn't think to open it right away to see if it worked.,1533513600,,235,3.9166666666666665

8719355,1,B00YYOFMMY,We bought this and it will not play in a DVD player due to a region code error.  It played when we bought it on a laptop and discovered the problem after the return window closed.  We thought it was our player only to find out it won't play.  Very disappointed.  Case isn't labeled to use outside USA.,1530230400,,301,4.137931034482759
8719356,1,B00YYOFMMY,Reading the discription which I just double checked there was no mention of this being a non-US region disc.  Wouldnt work on our DVD player.  Very disappointed especially since our daughter was looking forward to watching Cinderella.,1529971200,2,234,5.297297297297297

8719358,3,B00YYOFMMY,"The fact you get the original 1950's version with this pack makes it worth the price. I didn't really care for the live action version though, watching it for the firstime. Just didn't capture that classic Disney ""feel"" to me. My first thought that came to mind. Where's the
iconic music? A Dream is a Wish your Heart makes? Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo? Not one note from this young lady. She hums briefly which looks to be Oh Sing Sweet Nighting Gale but that's about as far they take it. Which is dissapointing. I believe Walt always had that talent to drive story telling with unforgetable songs and emotion. Unfortunately with this trend Disney is doing with all these remakes of classics this one falls flat. Enchanted with Amy Adams although not Cinderella related would be a better pick to bundle. It captures everything a modern live action Disney fairytale should be and does it very well!",1529625600,,890,4.711538461538462
