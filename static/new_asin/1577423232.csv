196326,5,1577423232,"Overcoming superstardom to become a respected actress apart from the vocal talents that made you a legent may be impossible.  For anyone that is, except Reba McEntire.  She became Lizzie Brooks to me.  Her other movies  were nothing like this.  I forgot it was her up there and got really  involved in the story.  It has everything: drama, comedy, family.  The  supporting cast was very well chosen and a wonderful chemistry was  achieved.  In fact, I am going to watch it again right now!",921110400,,489,4.7023809523809526

196328,5,1577423232,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE, but then, I love anything that Reba McEntire does-She is my IDOL!!!!
This movie came out when I was still married and he was my Forever Love!  I loved him, supported him, defended him for 17 years, but, I was wrong, he went from being MY FOREVER LOVE, but he will forever be stuck as a TOAD!!
I LOVE EVERYTHING REBA!!",1399680000,,336,4.1692307692307695

196334,5,1577423232,"Of every movie and/or tv show I have seen with Reba in it, she can't do no wrong. I enjoy everything I have seen her in. I saw this movie back in '97 when it was on tv, but never knew it was on dvd 'til a few years ago. I wanted to get a copy as it would help complete my Reba collection, but could not find it at a decent price. It's not even available on dvd on the Canadian counterpart of Amazon, just vhs. I paid over $40 for this and I will only do that for certain things. To me it was well worth it. Reba is awesome.",1367107200,,523,3.6785714285714284

196339,5,1577423232,"Forever Love is a heart warming and gut wrenching story of Lizzie (mcentire)who is in a coma for 20 years. The story begins as Lizzie begins to wake up from the coma to find that her daughter is grown and that her best friend and her husband are very, very close. She has to learn about microwaves, and other newfound gadgets. Reba does an excellent job of portraying Lizzie in this movie. She makes this so believeable and does a fine job of acting in this. I understand this was based on a true story. It is an incredible journey and a must see. Be prepared to have some kleenex around though. Reba is very good in this film and the song Forever Love is beautiful.",1306713600,,666,4.2936507936507935
196340,1,1577423232,"I have never in my life dealt with a company who knows so little about what they are doing as Amazon.com. I order a few movies for my mom for Mother's Day, and didn't even realize I was going through their site. I thought I was going through Reba's pesonal store. So far they have sent me at least 5 doubles, that I did not order and have charged me for each and every one of them. $14.98 plus a $1.00 whatever that's for. So I called them, they told me I had to contact the individual seller, I thought they were the seller and at one point some guy did give me my money back, just so I would not write about him, but of course you guessed Amazon took it back again. So I am now out $79.90 and have sent all the extra movies back and I don't have the money back and Amazon.com won't do anything about it, because accourding to them, it's not their fault. It's not my fault, so whose fault is it and why shouldn't I have to pay the price. It simply not fair and straight up wrong. Somone should have to give my money back period !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1304985600,,1043,4.067961165048544
196341,5,1577423232,I thought this was a great movie and just ordered it the it. I saw it years ago on TV and just read some of the reviews. I had heard there was a real life woman who was in a coma for twenty years after she was in a car accident. The case I read about the woman in the coma was interesting.,1302048000,,289,3.6031746031746033
196342,1,1577423232,Worst DVD I have ever purchased in terms of the quality of the picture. The story was simply beautiful but the price was outlandish for a poor quality DVD.  I'm sorry I ordered it!!,1300233600,,181,4.323529411764706
196343,1,1577423232,Let's make this short and sweet.  Miss McEntire cannot act her way out of a paper bag.  What could have been a good movie is marred by her performance.  The story lacks credibility and is not helped by her amateurish emoting.,1297123200,,225,4.439024390243903
196344,5,1577423232,"This is a great family movie.  Shows the power of love, loyalty, and faith.  Reba does a phenomenal job.",1282608000,,104,4.421052631578948

196346,5,1577423232,"It is easy to watch this movie and think ""That could never happen.""  But if you like a great love story... or if you're just a BIG Reba fan, then this is a movie you must watch.  It is a rare story about being devoted to the person that you vow to love and take care of until death... something that isn't seen much now-a-day.",1242864000,,326,4.0
196347,5,1577423232,"This is one of my favorite movies so far, to think that someone could close there eyes and open them up twenty years later is very scary. I just loved the way the husband never gave up on his wife and hopping that one day she would pull through, amazing it is one great movies for my library.",1217721600,,292,4.051724137931035

196352,5,1577423232,"This movie is wonderful. I don't know how many love stories could withstand a 20 year coma. I own this on video. I have also seen it many times on Lifetime. I was happy to read the info on the movie which has been corrected for the DVD, On the video's jacket, they have the name of Lizzie's husband wrong (Alex)I am not sure why. Glad to see this was corrected for the DVD.",1163980800,3,373,4.054054054054054
196353,4,1577423232,"I saw this movie on Lifetime, the cable television network for women. It is a very romantic, though highly improbable, film. Through illness, a young mother and wife (Reba McEntire) is in a coma for twenty years of her life. Her husband (Tim Matheson) remains devoted to her, bringing her home from the hospital, when the hospital said that there was nothing more that could be done for her. Her husband said that he married her for better or for worse and ensconced her in their home, providing her with constant care and attention.

Meanwhile, the years pass by. Their beloved young daughter grows up, but Reba is always at the center of it all, as they talk to her, sing to her, and pattern her movements. Every care and consideration is given her, as she lays sleeping, seemingly insentient to her surroundings. Her best friend has looked after her daughter and husband, as if they were her own. When the best friend's husband dies, the husband and the best friend comfort each other. Then, the amazing happens. Reba wakes up from her twenty year coma and fights to regain her life, her husband, her daughter, and her best friend.

This is the story about their struggle as a couple and as a family to regain what has been dormant, but not lost. Reba McEntire gives a beautiful performance as the wife and mother struggling to reclaim her life and finding herself in a world she no longer recognizes and in a body that has aged twenty years since she last saw it. Ms. McEntire has an immensely likable persona and magnetic personality that shines through in this role.

Tim Matheson gives a sensitive and moving performance, as the devoted husband who finds himself initially conflicted as he struggles between the love he has for his wife and the love he feels for her best friend. He ultimately makes the only choice that he could make, as he finds himself falling in love all over again with his wife. Believe me, all the women watching this film will half fall in love with him. All women should be so lucky to have a husband as caring and sensitive as this one seems to be.

This is definitely a chick flick. The title song ""Forever Love"" is also beautifully sung by Ms. McEntire.",1149120000,12,2189,4.576530612244898
196354,1,1577423232,An unbelievable plot with Reba (who is NO ACTRESS) at the helm playing the lead (horrors of horrors!!)  She's really quite terrible.  She needs to stick to singing and forget Hollywood!!,1131062400,,186,4.967741935483871
196355,5,1577423232,"Beautiful heartwarming movie of a devoted and loving husband played by the beautiful Tim Matheson.  His wife Emma (Reba McIntyre) at a young age becomes comatose for 20 years. Against doctor's advice, her husband takes her home to care for her, working very hard to pay her medical care.  After 15 years his neighbor played by Bess Armstrong, her husband dies and these two become romantically involved.  Emma awakens from her Coma, well just watch the rest, I don't want to give the ending away. It is an incredible movie and I recommend it to everyone. Maybe a certain attorney should have watched this before making his ruling.",1111795200,3,630,4.814814814814815

196362,5,1577423232,I was blown away with this movie it takes a situation that none of us could deal with and showed us how.  I cried and laughed through out this movie.  It makes you revaluate everything that is important to a person.  Reba McEntire isn't just the best country music singer but actress too.  This is her best movie yet.  The music in it is just wonderful and will  make you cry.  This movie is great to watch with the one you love.  My  fiance even loved it.  I don't know of many romantic movies a guy will say  he loves.  This movie made me think about what all I have and gave me a  different perspective on life.  I am sure that anyone that can see it will  agree.  I think you should beg and plead to get this movie because I'd be  the first to buy at least one copy.  I hope that they make it available  soon!  I will keep checking to see if it ever becomes available.  If you  love this movie another good one to check out is Pure Country with George  Straight that is another good one too.  Thank you for letting me share  about this movie.  It may be a happy and yet sad movie but it is the best  I've seen yet.  I own the cd with the music now all I need is the movie.  Take my word for it..... It is the BEST MOVIE!  I love it and I hope  you do too.,959904000,3,1259,3.876984126984127
196363,5,1577423232,"Reba McEntire has been an idle to many young people.  Including me.  She played a Marvelous role of Lizzy.  I thought that character was perfect.  I don't think anyone else could have done it any better.  Having to go  through the tradegy of loosing 20 years of your life and not being able to  see you child must have been devestating.  She did a marvelous job and  so did Tim Matheson, and everyone else.  I recomend this movie to anyone  who loves Reba McEntire",953510400,,464,4.404761904761905

I remember watching it and thinking there is  no way that I could ever cope with a sickness that took away 20 years of my  life...but Reba portrayed a lady that did it and got her life back on  track!  If you haven't seen the movie, you should beg for it to be  released.  This movie if for the Reba fans and those who love tear jerker  movies!
