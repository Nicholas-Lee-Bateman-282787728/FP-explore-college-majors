8473928,2,B005HXCO6S,These films were shot in 3d. And on that level it's worth owning. These are grade c level  income films.  That were filmed in the late 90's early 00's.  They are very cheap and done with newcomers.  They are what I would call sexploitation films with a horror theme.  They were made straight for then dvd and vhs market. Back then you had to use red and green glasses.  This is a proper 3d blu ray and on that level it's for 3d collectors. The picture was shot using two video cameras?  I don't know but it's good enough I suppose for this blu ray which is cheap and not a dvd-r at least.  Perhaps this is only for 3d collectors on some levels.  As this would not make most horror fans happy or sexploitation fans either!.  But I must salute them for using two cameras back then.  At least you have that here.,1416441600,,809,4.188311688311688
8473929,1,B005HXCO6S,"Worse movies ever.  Using 3d conversion lens in front of ancient camcorders. If anything can give 3d a bad name it is these movies.  If you want a headache and eye strain buy these.  These should be destroyed, trashed immediately.
These are what 3d movies should NOT look like.",1411689600,,277,4.612244897959184

8473932,1,B005HXCO6S,"First about the 3D. This was developed several years ago by the company Razor 3D before the advent of Plasma/flat screen TV's for the home market. THey also made the lenses whih could theorhetically any home videographer the abilility to attach it to their camcorder and let the lenses split the image using a series of mirrors. For the time it wasn't bad but you had to buy decoding system and glasses and they would only play on old school tube sets and many people would complaign of flickering images. Now the 3D has been converted to Blu Ray and it looks pretty good but since each of these features were shot in about 4 days apiece there was really no time to set up shots that would take advantage of depth. If you get near the end of Bloody Tease and that's a tall order you'll see what I mean but by that time it's hopeless. Seeing as this was made well before Zombies Vs. Strippers and a few other exploitations about a sorority of  vampires the premise seemed ripe for a grindhouse type quickie. The acting is abysmal. The women seem to be porn newcomers who  can't afford their boob jobs yet so they're doing this steaming pile and saving their pennies. The guys to seem to be aspiring gay porn actors but don't mind kissing a few gals for the bucks or drugs. Both Bloody and Blood Sisters have no more than a grain of plot and the rest is  nonsensical babbling and worst of all there is barely any nudity at all which is pretty bad considering that's what they are advertising and that's  what most people expect. Honestly you and your teenage sons could do better than this. The only sets are someones house,a motel room,A campus when no one is around. The strip club is a by the hour rock band rehearsal studio. They probably paid ten an hour for it and they just moved in a stripper pole and some folding chairs and voila a nightclub with no one in it save one customer and the strippers that never strip. Blood Sisters is so cheap you can see the shadow of the guy working the fog machine and hearing the loud mechanical hiss. If you made this movie into a drinking game you would be dead drunk in ten minutes. I enjoy bad cheap movies. I grew up in the drive in era but this is scraping the bottom of the barrel.",1357430400,3,2230,4.315035799522673
8473933,4,B005HXCO6S,This b movie came on time but the cinematography is archaic and shouldn't have been in 3D.  If you want the true 3d experience buy transformers or something,1356652800,,156,4.571428571428571
8473934,1,B005HXCO6S,"I love cheesy horror movies, but this is beyond cheese-core.  It looks as though it was filmed in someones basement.  The signs are magic marker on cardboard.  I have seen kids do better school reports.  The 3-D is bad enough to give anyone a migraine.
the movie gets a 0 out of 0
the 3D gets a 0 out of 0",1355702400,4,305,3.9508196721311477
