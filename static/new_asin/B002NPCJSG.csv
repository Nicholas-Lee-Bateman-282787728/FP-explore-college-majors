8375259,4,B002NPCJSG,"Not bad late 60's West German-made, English-dubbed Edgar Wallace thriller/mystery.  A Scotland Yard detective investigates strange murders and kidnapping that turn out to be the work of a white slavery ring.  The color is lovely and the picture is crystal clear.  Only flaw is that the picture is surrounded on all sides by a black band.  Other than that the film is pretty good for this genre.  Recommended.",1474761600,,408,4.9411764705882355
