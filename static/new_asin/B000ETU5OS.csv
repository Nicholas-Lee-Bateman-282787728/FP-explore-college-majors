8114241,4,B000ETU5OS,"What a rollicking adventure. Its a shame it isn't remastered on DVD or BLU-RAY. Its hard to understand why such a prized film is so hard to find. Videos of this movie are selling for over $100. I found a ""good"" copy that was ""fair"" on AMAZON for under $25, as old and grainy as the 30 year old(1985) was, I still enjoyed the movie. Having now watched it for the first time I can understand why it was considered risque 55 years ago, but thats not the case now days. Nothing offensive is said or done to offend anyone, I would/will let my grandkids watch it. This movie is old, so I'm reviewing it with that in mind. It has plenty of swashbuckling by Dale Robertson(SINBAD's son), who wouldn't have been my first choice, but he did such a good job I can't complain. Vincent Price(OMAR) steals every scene he's in and provides comedic relief. The females are all BEAUTIFUL and do some swashbuckling of their own, seeing how they are THE FORTY THIEVES DAUGHTERS. I recently bought a copy of CAPTAIN SINHBAD (love GUY WILLIAMS) and I think this is a better movie(especially if on dvd)(NOT DVD-R). I look forward to the day someone puts good old swashbucklers(BAGDAD,THE PIRATE WARRIOR,AT SWORDS POINT,THE BUCCANEER,THE SPANISH MAIN and many others on DVD or BLU-RAY. The dvd-r's being put out by film studios are far too expensive for a burnt copy and I'll continue to buy movies on video before them. I gave this movie a 4 star, but it could easily have gotten a five if on DVD. AMAZON should change the picture involved with the movie seeing as its a picture of a STAR TREK movie when you bring this up on screen.",1304380800,7,1611,4.482993197278912
