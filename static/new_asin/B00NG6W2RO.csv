While Im probably in the minority, I actually enjoyed this movie as a B-horrir shark movie with some unintentionally funny momenrs. However I will say that the production agency that decided to include the red/blue 3D glasses in this really shouldnt be left in charge, as you will need active 3D glasses to watch it. That aside its a pretty fun movie if you don't set your expectations too high, and to the reviewer who called the movie dumb for having German subtitles...its Dutch, which he would have realized if he had selected subtitles on the main menu...and he could have turned them off, again on the main menu.",1525564800,,741,4.66412213740458
8677873,5,B00NG6W2RO,"I was so surprised at the 3D of this film. I practically jumped! ...and thats hard to do with me being the fact that Im an avid 3D Blu-Ray Movie Collector. I can sit through any 3D pop out scene without a jolt. But, this will do it! Best damn shark movie ive Ever seen in 3D!

If you are in the US, this movie will still work as long as you have an ALL REIGON 3D Player.",1512604800,,370,3.7435897435897436

8677875,4,B00NG6W2RO,"this gets four stars for the native 3d effects.  The movie itself features a lake filled with sharks and people trying to escape killers who run crime in the lakes area. Ok, a total b movie , but it's one in 3d.  This is a american movie and it is in ENGLISH. , so who cares what the subtitles are?  I have the uk version of this one and it looks great.  The 3d is great , the movie is a b movie , that is ok.  I saw this at the theaters and it was impressive visually on a big screen in 3d.  On your small one it will still look good but that's why I see 3d movies at the theater first. 3d  is made for big screens.",1447459200,5,616,3.6923076923076925
