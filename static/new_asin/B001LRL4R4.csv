8319572,5,B001LRL4R4,"I'm not going to give a synopsis of the story but I will say the movie was outstanding.  I highly recommend buying it.  If you want to watch a sexy lesbian story with a steamy sex scene, this isn't it.  In terms of ""action"", the actresses do not go belong first base.  The movie moves into three intertwined stories that deals with real issues like disability, HIV, Alzheimer, and coming out.  The acting was good and the story lines keep you emotionally vested.  You might even watch it several times and find a different meaning in the story and how it connected to the previous or next story.  This movie is much better than half the lesbian movies out there with their bad acting and horrible story lines.  It's $8!  You won't feel you wasted the money and you'll watch it multiple times. !",1376352000,,794,4.458333333333333

8319574,2,B001LRL4R4,"I tried to stay with it, but ultimately -- I drifted. Another Asian movie about homosexuality without any homosexual sexuality.",1319068800,3,127,5.4
8319575,5,B001LRL4R4,"After the first vignette, I thought this movie was good but such a downer, but as it went on, I thought it got better and better. I rented it on-demand, but I plan on buying it.

It's very much a drama, and as the other reviewer said, it contains cliches, but it's really a study of several lives intersecting in ways we don't find out until the final vignette. Friendship and romance take equal weight in the last two vignettes, while the first focuses on sisterhood. Disability--blindness, AIDS, and dementia--is a major theme, along with social change and the persistence of homophobia & transphobia. Nuanced and wide-ranging family issues shape a lot of the story. There is no happy ending, no neat wrapping up of conflicts, but by then end I felt like I'd just seen glimpses of lives containing much happiness and togetherness as well as strife.

This movie certainly isn't flawless: I was confused about when the different scenes were set--everyone's clothing looks contemporary to me. I'm not sure how to interpret Yeh's angry outbursts at Lily in part two--maybe just those of a man in great pain? And most of all, it was very heavy/dark.",1285891200,2,1146,4.782828282828283
