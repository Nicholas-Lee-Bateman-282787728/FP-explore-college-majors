175379,4,140498822X,"I found this double-disc set this afternoon and bought it JUST FOR the WS copy of ""The Buddy Holly Story"" to replace my old FS VHS copy. Although the slipcase, the DVD case and Amazon's website all clearly state ""Buddy Holly"" is 1.85 anamorphic widescreen it ISN'T-- it's 1.33:1.  And in case you are thinking maybe I don't have my DVD player's aspect ratio correctly selected, there is a title card at the end of the movie which says the movie has been ""modified . . .formatted to fit your TV"".  This pisses me off bad!!!",1283558400,9,522,4.427083333333333
175380,3,140498822X,"I had been wanting to get these two movies on dvd for a long time and when I saw that I could purchase them together, I couldn't pass it up.
I thought the acting was excellent in both films and even though I had read that not everything was accurate in them, I still found them to be entertaining and enjoyable to watch.",1233878400,,320,4.095238095238095
175381,2,140498822X,"Highly inaccurate portrayal of Buddy Holly, did not even get the name of the members of the Crickets correct.

175382,2,140498822X,"I have quite a large dvd collection (for a college student) that is somewhere between 300 and 400 movies and I've grown quite tired of picking up a double or triple feature set that purports all the movies to be in anamorphic widescreen and then when I put the movie in am disappointed that only one movie is and the other movies have ""been formatted to fit this screen""

I'm sure the companies that put these films out don't stalk me to find out what my TV setup is like so I'll put this out there for them to read: I try to buy movies that are formatted for my screen - they say so on the back, it's called ""anamorphic widescreen"". If I wanted a horrendously cropped piece of crap I'd watch a laserdisc of ""Let It Be"".

As an avid movie watcher it tends to frustrate me when companies think they can do this to consumers - essentially a very backhanded bait and switch where they don't even tell you they've switched... Don't get me wrong, I love deals like this (2 movies for 6 bucks!) but I already owned La Bamba and wanted to get this for the Buddy Holly Story... Now I'm stuck with a cropped Holly DVD and 2 identical copies of La Bamba!

Do your research before you decide to buy a double feature from any of the major companies - sadly this is hard to do when (like me) you're always finding yourself at the store with the last copy of something like this on the shelf and can't go home to check online... On a good note, not all of the double/triple features are like this. Paramount tends to go a good job as well as MGM (and they put each movie on its own disc!)",1200700800,40,1574,4.171052631578948
175383,4,140498822X,"Two great tributes for the price of one.  Makes no sense to buy them separately, if you like one, you will enjoy both.  Both movies are great tributes that do a good job of capturing the tragedy of losing these two stars, whose lights were extinguished too soon.  Though both movies play Hollywood with the truth, you have to appreciate the work and talent that Gary Busey put into recreating Buddy's songs, while Lou Dimaond Phillips' acting and Los Lobos' music were a great combination for capturing the essence of Richie Valens' stage persona.  Plus, the ""La Bamba"" DVD has some great interviews with Richie's family members, well worth watching, in the special features section.  Wish the same were true for the Buddy Holly DVD, but you just have to buy the ""Real Buddy Holly Story"" to get that.",1189209600,,800,4.726618705035971
175384,4,140498822X,"I found this two disc edition with ""The Buddy Holly Story"" and ""La Bamba"" for $ 9.99. They are both good movies,but ""La Bamba"" is a much better movie than ""The Buddy Holly Story"". ""La Bamba"" has a lot more character development and by the time the doomed young Valens meets his fate,it hits home just how sad and tragic this infamous plane crash was! Introducing Lou Diamond Phillips as Ritchie, he takes the role seriously and plays the part well. It is a tale about two brothers as much as it is a story about the young rock star's quick climb to stardom and tragic fall from the sky. Esai Morales plays Ritchie's half brother with gusto and it is this relationship that makes the film really shine. Ritchie's half brother is the opposite of the goodie two shoes Valens,but he is not really evil. It is a very interesting and touching story. ""The Buddy Holly Story"" is good,but the story never really goes anywhere,but lead us to the inevitable end. Busey does get brownie points for doing his own singing. It's a good film,but watching it back to back with ""La Bamba"" it pales in comparison. The Two DVD's are presented in widescreen,but ""Holly"" movie had a ""this has been formatted to fit you TV screen"" warning before the movie?? The transfers look very good and the soundtrack was rocking!",1187913600,6,1295,4.586206896551724

175408,5,140498822X,"La Bamba & The Buddy Holly Story

Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens were two young singers and musicians who became famous in the late 1950's when rock n roll became a dominant form of music. Both died young while on tour. Touring is dangerous: Eddie Cochrane, Rick Nelson, Otis Redding, etc. These movies commemorate their lives. Musicians have irregular lives, the use of drugs, legal or not, had an effect on others. Read the individual reviews for more details.

La Bamba was made in 1987. It tells about the family life of Ritchie Valens (Ricardo Valenzuela) and his neighborhood. Music, singing, and dancing do not require a large capital investment and is popular. Was La Bamba the first rock n roll hit in Spanish? This music was popular even if you spoke only English.

The Buddy Holly Story was made in 1978. It tells about Hollys band The Crickets (which influenced another band to choose the name The Beatles). Personal tours sold records, so Buddy toured with others across America. Then the music died. Where would he be if he lived another fifty years?",1494288000,,1064,4.771739130434782
175409,4,140498822X,"IF your answer is YES, please read on.  If your answer is NO, please move along...Nothing to see here.  This review regards Amazon Item ASIN: B000A50460 (ISBN 1-4049-8822-X).  The listing indicates ""Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1"" and ""Format: Color, NTSC, Full Screen, Anamorphic"".  The box case indicates that BOTH movies are ""1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen"".  BOTH individual slim cases for each movie also indicate ""1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen"".  Unfortunately, only La Bamba is in the Widescreen format.  The Buddy Holly Story is presented Full Screen and includes the on-screen preliminary notation that This Movie Has Been Modified To Fit Your Screen.  IF Amazon included the notation of ""Full Screen"" in the Format section to possibly alert prospective buyers that one of the movies is indeed presented in Full Screen, then good for them.  Given that the packaging clearly indicates that both movies are 1.85:1, if Amazon included the Full Screen notation in an attempt to alert the buyer that not both movies are 1.85:1, it seems likely that they did so only after receiving complaints from disappointed buyers.  IF so, I perceive this as a feeble and ineffective attempt to possibly clarify what is being offered for sell.  A movie's aspect ratio is important to me.  If it matters to you, you now possess some additional important information to assist you in making an informed decision regarding your possible purchase.  Item ordered April 13, 2017.

175413,5,140498822X,"I really liked th movie La Bamba.  It's a great story about a poor Hispanic family trying to make ends meet.  Lou Diamond Phillip plays Ritchie Valens and does a superb job.  He is ""discovered"" by a man from Dephi records in a small studio and all of a sudden he starts to bring in the money for his family.  He is 17, I think.  His brother ""Bob"" is trouble and jealous of his fame and that his mom is more caring about the good things Ritchie does.  Bob is into motorcycle gangs, drugs and such.  Well, I don't want to spoil the movie for you. It it was great.
The Buddy Holly Story I couldn't really get into watching withought playing with my phone or getting up and doing something else.  Some of it got my attention but it wasn't one of my more favorite movies.",1488412800,,766,4.163265306122449

175420,4,140498822X,"Both movies are entertaining and informative. I grew up in this era and both artists were influential on me and the band I was in as a teenager. Busy's portrayal of Holly while performing was amusing to say the least, with his 'praying mantis' gait! (Reminded me of our rhythm guitarist/singer who was, unintentionally, similar!). That Busy did his own singing and guitar playing (in most scenes) added to the authenticity of the film. I never thought Holly had an aggressive streak in him but apparently he did.
La Bamba an Lou D. Philips was another well told story...rags to riches to early death! Lou gives a believable account of Richie Valens and he is well supported by the support cast. Both young musicians knew what the wanted to do and against the odds, were successful and had a lasting influence on the new music scene which became known as Rock and Roll.

But both tell the basic stories of these two pioneers of Rock and Roll, their ascension, then tragic and unfortunate deaths. The pilot was at fault for taking off in marginal weather, unqualified to fly in those conditions. And, by doing so, he took three promising lives from us. But, these stories give us a little insight to the budding talent of these two rising stars. Long Live Rock and Roll.",1430006400,2,453,4.536585365853658

175510,5,140498822X,I have watched both DVDs over and over. The brightest stars burn up early. Their struggles and sacrifices might have never been appreciated if not told in these movies. The actors were believable in both The Buddy Holly story and La Bamba. VERY well put together with the story line. La Bamba does have very bad cursing in It. Except for the cursing I loved it.,1368835200,,361,4.484848484848484

175526,5,140498822X,The Buddy Holly Story was outstanding with Gary Busey as the main actor and performed all songs live as he was a former professional musican.  He was up for a grammy for this movie and rightfully should have received that honor. He performed Buddy Holly so well that I wouldn't be able to pick the real Buddy Holly from Gary's music- they sound so much alike. La Bamba was also a great movie and this set is a great tribute to the pioneers of rock music. Richie Valens was the first hispanic rock singer in America. It also shows his family and how they interact with each other- a great movie.,1315094400,2,594,4.351351351351352

I was bored by the Buddy Holly Story. It focused too much on the music and didn't really tell you much about who Buddy Holly was. Maybe thats because he was obsessed with his music, so no one knew what else there was to him.",1522540800,,492,4.020408163265306
