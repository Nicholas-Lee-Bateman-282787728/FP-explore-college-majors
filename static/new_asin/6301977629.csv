403662,5,6301977629,"I ""re-found"" this movie after watching ""Le Divorce"" the other day and instantly felt a recognition of Theirry Lhemitte's character. Then it came to me...this man was Xavier from ""Until September!"" I then remembered how I use to (years ago) watch this wonderful movie over and over again.  With that in mind, I went on E-Bay and Amazon trying to find another copy of it....hoping all along that it was on DVD.  To my surprise I found that the VHS copies out there were few and far between, being out of print, and $50 or more with no DVD in sight.  With that in mind, my husband suggested I search of my old VHS movies I had stowed away and guess what.....THERE IT WAS!  I now have a beautiful ""almost new"" copy of this wonderful love story to watch over and over once again.  It is one of those timeless love stories that puts me in a time warp of sorts as it is so  odd to see such a beautiful man twenty years older within a span of several hours.  My double feature is awaiting me so I must go.....""Until September"" and ""Le Divorce"" here I come!",1075939200,2,1048,4.262626262626263
403663,5,6301977629,"I first saw this movie a number of years ago, and once owned it on VHS.  I thought most CERTAINLY it would come out on DVD, but as yet it hasn't.  This is a most romantic movie.  I thought that if all French men were as Theirry Lhemitte, in their good looks, their speech and mannerisms they were adorable.  I wish this movie would come out on DVD, for I most certainly would buy it.  Its great, you love Karen Allen's character & you love Theirry Lhemitte in his role.  When I watched him in ""Le Divorce"", I was once again reminded of his beauty as a man.",1075507200,2,556,4.101851851851852
403664,5,6301977629,"I have to say that this movie is my all-time favorite.  I just love the scene where Karen Allen is on the Bateau Mouche and the old woman looks at her and touches her heart in commiseration.  I found the laughter during the sex scenes to be so natural.  And both of them have the most fantastic eyes...  His so stunning and beautiful...  Hers so huge and soulful.  I first saw this movie in 1986 on TV, and I try to catch it every time it's on.  It was just on WE today, and I still watched it on TV even though my Mother finally found it for me on VHS a couple of years ago.  Even owning the VHS, I would still buy it on DVD in a heart beat if (when?) available.",1074988800,3,663,3.8955223880597014
403665,5,6301977629,"I've just joined Netflix.  It is an excellent DVD rental club.  I looked up this, my favorite love story and was devastated to find that it's not available on DVD format.  I've seen this movie so many times.  Most memorable was during an affair with a Belgian prince.  We would watch a foreign movie in bed on Sunday mornings in San Francisco many years ago.  We'd sip on champagne and get lost in a film.  It was so funny!  He spoke several languages and when a film had subtitles he would occasionally nudge me and translate for me.  WELL........he would obviously forget that I could read the English subtitles just fine!!!  This however was in English and was so true to the American woman lost to romance with a classy European man.",1040774400,2,737,4.515151515151516
403666,5,6301977629,"I am a hopeless romantic and this movie is perhaps my favorite love story.  I stumbled across it quite by accident two weeks ago and am amazed that I missed it all of these years.  Thierry Lhermitte and Karen Allen exude incredible on screen chemistry, and I very much enjoyed their banter and culture differences.  There are no words to describe the incredible Thierry Lhermitte.  I simply cannot recall a more charismatic actor nor anymore with more beautiful eyes than that of this actor.  I was so taken by him that I have since tried to get my hands on some of his other movies.  Although I am not a great fan of subtitles, I highly recommend ""The Dinner Game"", a wonderful French comedy.  This man is still gorgeous.",1039132800,5,722,4.550387596899225
403667,5,6301977629,"Why this title is no long in print is beyond me. This is one of the great love stories. It was truly wonderful, with great direction and acting. So much so that you really feel you know the characters...and how often does that happen in a movie now-a-days. Although some may no have liked it due to the sex scene, I think the sex scene was well done and very real. But the best part was when Thierry Lhermitte was trying to find Karen Allen at the airport...I was right on the edge of my seat! I really what them to find each other. If anyone from MGM/UA ever reads this please bring the film out in DVD...PLEASE.",1031356800,16,613,4.203389830508475

Is is a romance set in France between and American and a married French man. Very French feel. Must be able to handle cultural differences.

He treats her like dirt for most of the movie, but hey, he's rich and handsome and French so I guess it's OK. The woman has so little self-respect to keep groveling for whatever time this man can give her it's painful to watch.

The actors, the scenes and beautiful City of Lights...Paris, the language....I love French , the music, the love....what more can you ask for?

403822,5,6301977629,"Being in complete agreement with most of the other people who reviewed this film, I have to say that the chemistry between Lhermitte and Allen is charming.  The humor in the film, the scenery, the music, and said chemistry make this a memorable film.  I first saw it on HBO in 1985 with  my  husband.  We love this film.  There is a notable amount of nudity.  Just a warning if that bothers some.  The extended cast members fill their roles with expertise and charm, as well.  Some of the lines are a bit hokey, but overall this film is well worth seeing.",1402185600,,555,4.362745098039215

403857,3,6301977629,"I think I was expecting too much from this film.  Somehow I did not feel that there was real chemistry between the two leading actors. I also did not feel any sympathy for the leading lady.  And then - there was simply too much nudity.  It's not that I am so prudish, but I honestly feel that the director was trying to shock his audience. Which would have been quite easy in the days when this movie was made. Now one seems much more nudity on the screen, but perhaps not such long scenes. It certainly will never make my list of ""best ever movies"".",1383696000,,550,4.219047619047619
403858,5,6301977629,"I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it many years ago.  I forgot about it until some how in a search it popped up and I remembered it.  I saw it again as an adult and fell inlove with the characters and the story all over again even though this time I had a clearer understanding of the whole story now.  This a simple story of two people who find true love in less than great circumstances.  But true love it is between these two.

********Spoiler**************

Sometimes people feel that certain situations are black and white with no middle ground.  But that is so not true,  The case of Xavier's marital status falls in the grey area.  If people pay close attention to what he says his marriage was never based on love for either him or his wife.  So there was no marriage to save. He finally knew what true love was and fidelity when he met Mo.

I love this film because it has everything love, fun, laughter, leads with chemistry that you want to over come all obstacles to be together,  Great music,  It's sensational and deserved better reviews from critics.",1383523200,,1072,4.435897435897436

403860,5,6301977629,"This is a sweet movie that I watch frequently. It is well made, the scenery is lovely...and so is Thierry. This is the quintessential chick flick but I felt the story was full of social candor and it is poignant. This is a worthwhile investment.",1378080000,,245,4.466666666666667
403861,5,6301977629,I first saw this film in 1984 and it became my favorite romance film. A few years ago I mentioned to a friend that I loved this movie and hadn't seen it in years.  I was surprised with a copy and now watch it periodically.  I still get that same feeling of how wrong the relationship is because he is married and has children but can't help rooting for Mo and Xavier.,1367712000,,367,4.083333333333333
403862,4,6301977629,"I bought this movie because my sister absolutely adored it.  I, on the other hand, thought it was mediocre.  However, you must consider that it was an old Black and White French film that is quite outdated now.  But it's worth viewing.",1367280000,,235,4.5476190476190474

403937,5,6301977629,"I saw this movie many times. I love the music . I think I love the music more than the movie. However, the eyes of Thierry were so hypnotising I could not take my eyes off him, so handsome. The kind of movie one does not forget.",1353024000,,228,3.872340425531915
403938,5,6301977629,"I remember seeing this movie back in the 80s and loving it.  I recently saw it again for the first time since the 80s and I was afraid I was going to be terribly disappointed.  Y'know...when you remember how much you loved a movie and then see it again after many years and it's just not the great movie you thought it was?  Maybe you've grown or maybe the film has become a caricature of its time....whatever, its such a disappointment.  But Until September didn't do that to me.  I enjoyed it just as much as I did then.  The only ""dated"" detail was the wardrobe selection for Karen Allen...she's such a natural beauty, coltish and playful, that when a designer tries to make her look sophisticated it sort of falls off (thought:  was this intentional?).  But, hey, the 80s decade was like that...very contrived.  Fortunately, the rest of the film looks as contemporary as if it were filmed last year.  It's a film for romantics.  If you have issues about its moral fabric (a woman having a relationship with a married man), don't see it.  It happens, it's life.  And since this film is about a Frenchman in France, it's a common cultural detail.  Until September is not about moralizing, nor is it about random sex with strangers.  It's about honesty and being true to your authentic self.....all wrapped up in a love story:)",1336435200,,1328,4.591489361702128
403939,5,6301977629,"I first saw this movie back in the 1980's a couple of years after it came out and watched it repeatedly, everytime it was on cable.  I am so glad it's on dvd and you will be too.  And Thierry Lhermitte is not hard on the eyes.  He is an absolutely gorgeous man and his eyes will cause your heart to stutter!  He will take your breath away.

A truly wonderful love story, even though there is the issue of adultery.  You can virtually watch the stuffiness and pomposity fall off of Xavier as Mo refuses to buy into it. The relationship somewhat hurts Mo because of her conflicted feelings about his being married and her feelings for him and scares the heck out of Xavier. His life is well ordered and just the way he likes it. Mo shakes everything up, including him. You can watch them slowly fall in love and his fear and insecurity are almost tangible during this journey. One of the best scenes in the movie is with his wife near the end.  There are no words exchanged, just looks between them that convey so much emotion.

If you like a great love story, invest in this one.  It is amazing.",1336176000,,1094,4.271844660194175
403940,1,6301977629,"After reading many of the reviews, I decided to buy this DVD.  I am such an idiot.  I guess I am just a prude.  Basically, I feel that a married person should not be hunting outside of their marriage for love.  I feel that an unmarried person should not bother with married people.  I feel that one should be proud to introduce one's date to anyone.  I believe one's children are a serious responsibility and that one should be present for them and should be a good role model for them.  Marriage vows should be taken seriously.  I feel if one becomes bored and tired of one's spouse, one should continue to try moving heaven and earth to regain that spark of true and deep love.  If you agree with most of what I have said, then this may be a somewhat disappointing if not distressful movie.
  However, if you believe in free love anytime, anywhere and with anyone that strikes your fancy, without consequences and responsibilities, then you may like this movie.
  It may be best to watch before buying!  ...I think I will do that in the future.",1284422400,10,1046,4.436842105263158
403941,5,6301977629,"I've checked this out of the library
many times and I think it is about

so much of Cillian Murphy. He has the
same beautiful blue eyes.;)Wouldn't it be
wonderful if a remake of this movie was
made starring Cillian Murphy and Rachel
McAdams? I just wish this movie had been
longer instead of being just 95 minutes,though.:\
I would have liked to have seen the relationship
between Xavier and Mo develop more slowly and to
have them get to know each other better before they
became intimate. I am surprised that this movie was
poorly received when it was first released. This movie
should have been a sleeper hit,like Ghost.
I highly recommend this movie for other hopeless romantics

I love the actors (Thierry Lhermitte is gorgeous), the characters they play, and the setting, Paris, which is my favorite city. The story line is romantic, amusingly stereotypical, and just a joy to watch.

As a side note, I purchased the DVD from a Canadian seller. They were fantastic and the movie arrived as promised, but imagine my surprise to find the movie did not have subtitles for the French portions (which are not many).

What a wonderful surprise, knowing nothing about it before seeing it.

Karen Allen and Thierry Lhermitte are beautiful together.  It's such a simple story (trip chaperone gets stuck in Paris after missing flight and starts affair with arrogant married frenchman) and yet the actors and location shots just meld together perfectly to create a most memorable, touching and funny film.

404012,3,6301977629,I first saw this moving in 1984.  It had always stuck in my head.  I just recently saw it again in 2005 and now I know why.  It is a movie that explores many feeling and sensations.  It is a movie that says sometimes leopards can get in control of their spots.......,1121472000,3,266,4.0576923076923075
404013,5,6301977629,I have seen this movie over hundreds of times!  Theirry Lhermitte is an absolutely amazing actor and this film makes you feel good.  Karen Allen and Thieirry's chemistry on film is extraordinary.  I lived in France and the portrayal of a frenchman is seen through the character of Monsieur LaPareau.  I highly recommend this film from the late 80's.  You will return to this film time after time.  I actually used the line on a man who had Thierry Lhemitte's eyes and it worked--he smiled at me and thanked me!,1104624000,34,510,4.611111111111111

Please MGM release it on DVD. I have e-mailed them and asked for them to do this. I hope some other people will do the same. This is a beautiful love story, that is well acted, and which features a beautiful musical theme, as well as beautiful scenery. The two stars have a great chemistry together. What more can i say about this film. I liked everything in this film.",1083801600,,545,4.102803738317757

7819202,5,6301977629,"This movie was very special to me because I was in France twice. Paris is magical and I was married there. So, this movie is special to me because it takes place in Paris when an American woman becomes stranded in Paris and meets up with a French man. She is rough around the edges and he is sophisticated and very married with children. The wife and children are in the South of France while he is in Paris and has an affair with this American woman. The movie pulls you in right from the start and moves along nicely. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a romantic story set in one of the most elegant places in the world.",1517616000,2,641,4.219512195121951
