8547821,5,B00A7D8V9C,Loved.  I learned some new poses and the workout was delightfully challenging.,1460592000,,78,5.5
8547822,5,B00A7D8V9C,"Based upon the excellent practice delivered by this teacher, this DVD is a worthy addition to anyone's collection of yoga DVDs. It is an authentic, challenging practice that doesn't skimp on the flow! There are undoubtedly some aesthetic issues with the DVD (i.e., the instructor has orange hair and the background she is practicing in front of is orange), and it's a bit cheesy. But all of that aside, the workout is excellent, and the workout alone is what my five-star rating is based upon.",1460419200,3,493,4.811764705882353
8547823,5,B00A7D8V9C,"I have not been to a yoga class in years. In fact, my level of activity has diminished greatly over the past three years since I went back to school to finish my degree. But since I have developed arthritis in my right hip joint and the soft tissue surrounding it has begun to cause significant pain, I decided to get back into yoga at home. I can work this 30 minute routine into my busy schedule with no problem. It is an adequately challenging routine for me to get back into yoga and also to begin to strengthen and stretch my hip region as well as the rest of my body and mind. I am grateful for the reading of scripture and loving encouragement expressed throughout the session.  It is nice to praise God as we take care of our body and mind.",1445644800,6,748,4.194444444444445

8547826,4,B00A7D8V9C,"I enjoy this workout. I prefer something around 30 min. This is about 50. It is a very thorough yoga workout. Not upbeat, just simple stretching, but very relaxing. I use this on days that I have extra time. I love the music of this particular one. I find myself singing along to these old favorites.",1393545600,3,300,4.375
8547827,5,B00A7D8V9C,I love practicing Christian Yoga and getting my sweat on!  This 1/2 hour flow DVD fits my busy lifestyle.  I can burn through a 1/2 session before work or even in a hotel room.  Thanks Courtney C. and Yahweh Yoga!  You rock!  God Bless!,1373760000,4,236,4.2727272727272725
8547828,5,B00A7D8V9C,"Just when I thought I had my favorite Yahweh Yoga DVD pegged, I did the 1/2 hour Flow class.  Great class with a good sweat and ton of encouragement.  For days when I want to move and sweat but don't have much time.  I'm a new woman after this class--physically stronger and spiritually refreshed.",1354665600,7,297,4.462962962962963
