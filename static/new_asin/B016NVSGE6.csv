8736874,5,B016NVSGE6,"This is another great DVD for the Pound Puppies fan! My girls love seeing the interaction, friendship and more that are a part of each episode. I can say as a dad that I really loved the messages that were shared in each of the episodes on this DVD. The show is family-friendly, fun-loving and you and your kids will have a ton of fun watching and sharing this together.
