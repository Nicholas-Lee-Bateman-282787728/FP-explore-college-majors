6853986,5,B00Q4MRSCQ,"I actually got to see this movie at a pre-screening  a couple years ago in Houston when it was under the original title, ""Renee"". For anyone familiar with the To Write organization, this is the cinematic retelling of the Renee Yohe story that sparked the creation of TWLOHA. For those not familiar, the synopsis above does a good job at giving a brief overview of how an organization that started with a few friends in Florida became something that has affected people all over the world dealing with some of the dark things that can come in this world. That said, this movie is sure to be significant for many of the people that have found inspiration in the story.

The movie itself, although very much in the class of independent films, doesn't lack in production quality, while benefiting from the artistic freedom that can come from the indie genre. Like the organization itself, this gets a lot of its vibes from the inclusion of music. Raw in emotion in times, these themes presented have many dream-like interludes. One thing that any potential viewer should be aware of is the potential scenes that could be triggering for people who struggle with self-harm, eating disorders, addiction, suicide. The producers of the film have done their best to minimize that potential, but in effort to preserve the true darkness of the story, have left in scenes that contain images and dialogue that are graphic.

This movie is sure to be enjoyable and inspiring to people both already familiar with the Renee story as well as those who haven't a clue what caused this organization to come up with its fairly cryptic and lengthy name.",1425340800,19,1631,4.776595744680851

6854004,1,B00Q4MRSCQ,Love Kat Dennings and Rupert Friend. This movie was a homage to battling drug addiction and cutting. There is nothing new with this movie. It is the same old regurgitated mess that was being shoved on me by PBS is the early 80's. Kat Dennings is better than this...so was the whole cast.,1465948800,,287,4.433962264150943
6854005,5,B00Q4MRSCQ,"Great movie! I bought this as a teaching tool for adolescents dealing with mental health / substance abuse issues. I hadn't seen any previews prior to watching the film, and I was utterly blown away! It's a great story about bipolar disorder, drugs, pain, and inspiration! It may be a bit controversial for some audiences, due to drug references and some implications of sexual assault. I would definitely recommend this to any film buff, mental health clinician, or anyone interested in true inspirational stories.",1465689600,3,515,5.142857142857143

6854007,5,B00Q4MRSCQ,"Absolutely amazing movie, I've been following To Write Love on Her Arms since 2008 after losing a friend. Never got a chance until a couple months ago after my best friend getting hooked on coke and pills then subsequently getting raped and abused my her boyfriend and his friend over the course of two years, I was stuck on the side lines. Until  one night, the first time is seen her in months, she told me she had tried to kill herself 3 times. A week later I got a text at 2am saying sorry I'm such a s***ty friend. That night took 26 mg of adderall and a 1/2 of coke. Two days later I carried her into the ER after she swallowed am entire bottle of sleeping pills. One very difficult year later I stumbled upon this. For the first time i saw someone else who understood. Such a beautiful true raw story of recovery. I saw each character in my life played out and it left me laughing and crying and and truly touched",1460937600,,920,4.19774011299435

I've been lucky that my teen hasn't turned to drugs, or had other horribly dark bad things happen to her. That being said we've been dealing with many things involved in this movie.  It's not a movie for a date night, but it is worth watching.

6854021,4,B00Q4MRSCQ,"I have always supported this association and so when I found that they were going to be producing her story I was excited about it.  The story as a whole was very good.  All of the characters were very relatable.  The only thing that I didn't like was the story jumped to much.  At one point Kat Dennings character tells her friends why she became how she was because of something that happened to her at the Halloween party that they went to.  Unless I missed this it never showed that situation or even leaned to that situation, it just jumped from the Halloween party to her separating herself from her friends and becoming a drug addict.",1449014400,,641,4.444444444444445

6854024,4,B00Q4MRSCQ,"I am going to begin this review by saying that I loved the movie, I got this movie primarily for the 3 lead performers, Kat Dennings, Rupert Friend and Chad Michael Murray. Taken as a movie this is a wonderful experience and the performances of those in question are also wonderful, the stand out performance has to be Rupert Friend as the man who totally by accident must help the very troubled kat Dennings. chad is the man who wants to tell her story. is this a movie worth seeing...absolutely. Why did I review this as a movie? We all have pain and we all have various types of heartbreaks. How we choose to deal is up to us as strong human individuals, seek help? sure. Our lives are what we make of them.",1445299200,4,710,4.3059701492537314

6854066,5,B00Q4MRSCQ,"This bravely honest co-written (Kate King Lynch, Nathan Frankowski) then intensely directed (Nathan Frankowski) movie glares a spotlight on suffering and behaviors which are very uncomfortable to look into. They are equally necessary to put into that light to get society talking about their destructiveness as they can be such a large part of people's lives. For Renee Yohe (Kat Dennings) this is her truth and is based on her own life, her illnesses, her addictions, her self-injury, and her incredibly creative imagination. A stark look at Renee's world as it is crumbling down around her at the young age of nineteen. At the outset, Renee's mother lets her know that she had forgotten to take her medication the previous night. As she gives it to her in the morning, Renee calls it her ""crazy pill"" as her mother answers; ""Bipolar disorder isn't crazy"". She pops her pill into her mouth just as quickly as she spits it right back out after her mother leaves. Renee is not taking her medication and her life is beginning to spiral out of control.

As a young child, Renee (then - Isabella Iannuzzi) had an inventive belief in fairy tales while making up her own places where she felt safe and the use of fantasy illustrations fill parts in the movie. It is quite an imaginative way to show what is on Renee's mind and what she is feeling. She had the ability to find those shielding spaces in which she needed to hide. As she grew older, those same places became completely detrimental to her health and safety. She becomes severely depressed, addicted to illegal substances and has an unsettling ability to place herself in the most dangerous areas to self-medicate and to escape her own severe emotional issues and pain. Renee is in dire need of help and her two friends, Jessie (Juliana Harkavy) and Dylan (Mark Saul) are trying everything to help Renee to see the truth of her situation. She does have the ability to escape fully into music which is a large part of the film featuring many bands and an aggressive soundtrack (Robbie Bronnimann and Andy Hunter). For many people who suffer from mood disorders, music can tame extreme emotions and also be very useful for calming. Renee indulges in escapism through her music and the soundtrack becomes another evolving character in the film.

At a particularly bad time for Renee, she finds herself wandering the city of Orlando, FL alone as she is not allowed to be at home any longer being a danger to herself and her family. She finds an earnest friend in David McKenna (Rupert Friend). He is attending a neighborhood church's support group then offers to aid her in obtaining recovery from her addictions to illicit drugs first through eventual rehab. She accepts the offer after some coaxing and the story of Renee Yohe's movement; ""To Write Love on Her Arms"" (TWLOHA) now begins with another integral friend, Jamie Tworkowski (Chad Michael Murray) and subsequent filmmaker who begins to document her life story and bring it to the public through organized speeches and forums.

I have been waiting for this film to finally be released as soon as I heard the news of it from The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). It has started a sincere spreading dialog in this country and beyond. Jamie Tworkowski founded the growing movement, TWLOHA, in 2006, and it has spread everywhere after documenting the story of Renee Yohe's harsh struggle with her addictions, depression, self-injury, and attempted suicide. It also became a nonprofit organization that same year. In 2010, it became TWLOHA, Inc. based in Florida and carrying far beyond through collective communication and the music industry including many bands in several countries. Included on the disc is a collection of information to learn about this important movement in the very interesting special features. Within are the Deleted Scenes, a 'Making of the Movie' in a featurette and a 'Music in the Movie' featurette. These all offer more information about this important movement to begin discussions about this necessary social dialog of change. I was profoundly moved by Renee's story and was greatly anticipating the release of the DVD. This does get decidedly graphic in several places as it is her boldly told life story so I would add a *Trigger Warning* to all potential viewers - but also a 'congratulations' to everyone involved in its making.",1428019200,12,4381,4.901617250673854

6854075,5,B00Q4MRSCQ,"This film really nailed the heartbreaking struggles of not only the addict, but the loved ones of an addict. Recovery is a never ending process and completion of rehabilitation does not mean recovered- and this film nailed this very point that others often fail to comprehend.
Renee is a true inspiration, because trying, even if you have to try over and over again, is a sign of someone who is stronger than they get credit for.

I have to mention that Crazy Fishes sounds beautiful, and it's a damn good track.",1426291200,4,512,4.626373626373627

This movie is....amazingly insightful into the truth that lies behind the passing faces that most people give no glance to.  The struggles that Renee goes through (in life and in the film) have mirrored my own since I was an early teen.  When I found the To Write Love on Her Arms site, it changed things for me.  It didn't pacify my inner struggles, but it caused me to have hope.  Everyone has a story to tell, and I'm a firm believer in that.  This film can be a bit triggering for some, but my advice to those who may worry: hold someone's hand and push through it until the end, because it is very much worth it (much akin to life in general).  Great film, amazing soundtrack, and a smile on mine and my friends faces----priceless.",1426204800,5,792,4.3108108108108105
