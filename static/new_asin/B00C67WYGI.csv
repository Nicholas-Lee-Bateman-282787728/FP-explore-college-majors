8577578,5,B00C67WYGI,"Eltjo has a good, low-pressure approach to teaching fingerstye guitar.  I find that my ""picking"" hand is learning coordination in spite of my wanting to rush ahead against Eltjo's advice.  Take his advice and don't advance until you've mastered each step.  His dry sense of humor is fun to listen to; he reminds me of me.  Good course, well worth the money.  Dealing with Peghead Productions was seamless.  They let me know what kind of delays to expect since they are located in the Netherlands, and this product had to go through US customs.",1434758400,4,543,4.723404255319149

10/20/2014 Update ...

I have been practicing what is being taught on this video on a consistent basis and I must say everything that Eltjo said would happen has happened. I am getting it down and getting better doing it in pieces as he instructs. I struggled early on and thought I wouldn't get it but Eltjo was right ... keep going and doing what he teaches and it will come. This note comes from someone who tried at various times in his life to learn guitar but couldn't break through. I thought I didn't have the ability but I do. I now think that someone could learn finger picking or any other style with the proper mindset and Eltjo was the first one to burn this in to me. He is a good teacher that, if you want to learn finger style, should be listened to. I would also suggest justinguitar (dot) com. All free guitar lessons (no lie totally free) I wish that I had access to this DVD and Justin's website back in the 60's when I was a teen ... but it is never to late :-)",1407369600,4,1077,4.1980676328502415
8577580,5,B00C67WYGI,"I've played electric guitar for many years and recently attempted (and struggled) to learn fingerstyle on my own. Now, I'm working through the DVD and fingerstyle is *finally* making sense. Eltjo breaks down all aspects of the technique. The system is ""idiot proof"" (I should know), one just has to put in the time. Well worth the money. The teaching is excellent, but be prepared to spend up to a year perfecting everything in the course. Eltjo goes over potential pitfalls and learning curve frustrations and how to overcome them. He also has a good (dry) sense of humor. Oh, and his playing is crazy good.",1396915200,4,608,4.745283018867925
