1652716,1,B00005R245,"I love this movie, but hate this DVD.  The first time I saw Percy was on Showtime in the late 1980's and I was smart enough to tape it at the time.  I tried to buy two factory VHS versions of it on eBay and both were pirated versions worse than mine.  With great relief I bought the DVD, only to find out it comes from Anchor Bay, which I perceive as a bunch of mercenary investors who have no appreciation whatever for what they market (my other experience with them was the ""Crime Story"" DVD's where the sound quality is abysmal and the video is worse than what I taped off of NBC in the 1980's with my wired-remote Mitsubishi VCR - and what group with any - any - entertainment or artistic savvy would stand behind a sailboat logo??).  They re-arranged the scenes!  The first scene is supposed to be the talk show appearance, not the accident (or whatever it was).  You know, the studio tech saying ""My mother used to call it, 'Percy'"" segueing directly into God's Children and the introductory credits.  I stopped the DVD then and there and have no idea what other butchery was performed on this.  I would strongly suggest that you exhaust any possible VHS outlet for this before buying the DVD which, unbeknownst to most buyers of it, is an act of desperation.  I'll stick with my hissy, monophonic, off-air VHS recording from 20 years ago, thank you very much.  At least it resembles what the makers of it intended.",1161907200,18,1421,4.4517374517374515
1652717,4,B00005R245,"Well, being a HUGE Kinks fan I bought this as a X'mas present for myself.  I owned the soundtrack first and loved all of the music on it, so I was a bit surprised to find out that most of the music was written for porn scenes in the movie!  Still, the music is EXCELLENT and the movie is a funny cult classic also.  They don't make movies like this anymore.....I can see why.  Rent it before you buy it.  If you're a Kinks fan, just go ahead and buy it.  Ray Davies has said that it's his favorite film of all time!",1010188800,13,515,3.9514563106796117
7951643,5,B00005R245,I was a little unsure about this when I bought it but it turned out to be a great story and the DVD quality was fine.,1495238400,,117,3.5384615384615383
7951644,5,B00005R245,"Okay, I admit it...I LOVE A SEX FARCE.

This is as odd as it gets.
It has several supporting actors that really hit the big time [Denholm Elliot, Elke Sommer, etc.]a while later..

I have been LQQKING for this movie for years...[I heard a British DVD had been previously issued with the reels out of sequence, but have never personally seen one for confirmation.] There is a moment of continuity-curiosity that is in the hospital, then the man goes into a fantasy sequence...that might JAR the viewer, but shortly afterward the premise is easily understood.

This Simple 'B' movie is about a guy that gets wounded by a falling chandelier, and received the Male organ via transplant of a Lothario.
Elke Somer plays a bawdy dancer dressed as a nurse to take it for a test Drive.

The story follows the relationship status of the transplantee after the surgery, and the success level of the doctor [Denholm Elliot,] as well as the wives and lovers of BOTH men, as the new owner of PERCY deals with intimacy and an ex-wife that publicly outs-HIM as the recipient... It has hilarious events, and edits or euphemisms for Penis throughout...in-fact that was part of the MPAA/studio agreement, that penis NEVER be spoken.

The KINKS' Ray Davies and other members made the soundtrack music, and the ALBUM has oft been collected by their fans without any true clue to the film's actual plot. As a Stand-alone, the various songs on the soundtrack really leaves you felling the KINKS are VERY ANTI-TRANSPLANT. [of course they DO play a weird musical version of LOLA.]",1489795200,2,1555,4.787313432835821

7951646,4,B00005R245,"I saw this british comedy while I was in Brisbane, Australia. The subject matter was very funny. I don't think that the movie ever was released in the states. The movie is about the first penis transplant and the British public's fascination to find out who the donor was. Funny and great popcorn entertainment. Leave it to the British.",1421798400,,336,4.711864406779661
7951647,3,B00005R245,"Typical 60's British humor. I actually bought it to see the Yardbirds and to understand why Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin had received the nickname ""Percy"". I have a good idea now. Very fitting indeed. LOL. I must say I loved seeing the fashions of the time.",1417737600,2,257,4.48936170212766
7951648,2,B00005R245,"you should mention that dvd is on mpeg2 while technology plays at the moment mpeg4!
so..................you should let us know",1379289600,,126,5.35
7951649,4,B00005R245,"Anyone who is familiar with the "" Carry On "" film series will see some of that humour in this film.  It was defintely ahead of  it's time with it's unusual storyline and the humour was considered a little vulgar back in the early 1970's!  But compared to the stuff they make today this is quite tame!  Hywel Bennett is simple one of Britains best actors!  He is a very natural actor who is very believable in every part he plays!  There are also a number of well known  faces in this movie!  All in all this film is a lot better than the reviews would have you believe!",1354924800,2,569,4.155963302752293
7951650,2,B00005R245,"Here's a royal turkey (that is, a bad movie made in Britain) that defies the Lenny Maltin-esque idea that EVERYTHING from 'cross the pond is pure gold.

The best thing one can say about PERCY (1971), besides its having Denholm Elliott in the cast, is that the soundtrack album contains THIRTEEN (count 'em) Kinks songs, including that massive hit, ""Lola."" Unfortunately, these tunes play during moments of soft prn, which is frequent.

What a cringe-inducing story!

This guy loses his johnson in an accident and becomes the first ever recipient of a pole transplant. He names the new attachment ""Percy."" Thus begins a dreadful exploration of where Percy's gone before and its new owner wants to be. Gar!",1343433600,3,704,4.9491525423728815
7951651,5,B00005R245,A great light-hearted entertaining movie. Enough comedy to keep the viewer interested without being over the top. A movie for anybody.,1307750400,,134,5.428571428571429
7951652,5,B00005R245,"I have had the soundtrack for years so I looked through Amazon to see if it was actually available and there it was.  I heard it was also available on Netflix , but it wasn't expensive on Amazon. You can also view the trailer on Youtube (but look under ""Percy"" Elke Sommers, otherwise you will find ""Percy Sledge"" or ""Percy Faith"" and other artists in that genre). So I purchased it.  I don't know how I missed it then (in'71) but it was high school time for me and I was in a dark haze in those times .  I have to say that I really enjoyed it and found it amusing for the time it was filmed.  It brought back my times in London.  On a blu-ray player the quality was great and the stereo sound enhanced it.  I even had a friend watch it with me who is the opposite of me film-wise, who he is a James Bond, Bourne fanatic, so you can see we have very different tastes in cinema.  We both thought it was very well done, dated all the same but that was fine.  In fact I am listening to the soundtrack as I am writing this review.  I actually think my mum and dad would enjoy it if they were still alive.  My mum has watched John Waters films also and found them enjoyable too (the more recent ones though, I don't think ""Female Trouble"" or ""Pink Flamingos"" would have been appropriate out of respect for her).
Find it while it is still available any way you can, watch it, and then make up your own mind and don't be influenced by what others might report.",1294704000,3,1453,4.102473498233215
