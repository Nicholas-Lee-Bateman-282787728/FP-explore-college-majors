8525935,5,B0086V7Z3K,"Strength may not always be in numbers, and deep commitment rarely is. This recording proves to be the exception. Jiri Belohlvek (remember his wonderful performances in the 1993 Arthaus DVD Dvorak cycle?) has assembled 130 young players - including five harpists! - of the Prague Conservatoire Symphony Orchestra for the opening concert of the Prague Spring Festival 2011 and its traditional performance of Smetana's Ma Vlast. An appealing documentary illustrates the extended rehearsals and the spirited cooperation of the many musicians and others involved in this ambitious project. The concert itself is recorded in very good PCM Stereo and equally good video: no small feat given the orchestra's size and the limitations of the Prague Smetana Hall. Belohlvek - a strict taskmaster but visibly revered by the musicians - has a firm grip on his large band, and the orchestra plays like a first-rate ensemble after a few warm-up minutes. Keep in mind that these young musicians do not have the esprit de corps of a long-standing symphony orchestra, born and developed through years of collaboration. The end result therefore is even more amazing, both in solo and in unanimous ensemble work: everyone is fully committed to and transported by the occasion.

Now to the interpretation. There are some very good readings available on CD (Mackerras, Neumann, Pesek, Wit et al.), on DVD we had so far only Rafael Kubelik's impressive 1984 production with the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, now dated in audio and video. The new recording can stand proudly next to the best. In some respects, it clearly outshines its predecessors: certainly through the energy and immediacy of the music making and just as much through the reading itself which is highly idiomatic, subtle and, at times, breathtakingly powerful. Among the cycle's six parts, there is no low point at all: from the majestic Vysehrad with its stunning harp chords through a vibrant Vltava, a ferocious Sarka, a warm and melodic From Bohemian Fields and Groves to the two concluding pieces, Tabor and Blanik, both sharply etched, nostalgic and full of atmosphere. Belohlvek knows this music very well and he manages to find quite a few new insights and nuances along the way. At the same time, he highlights recurring motifs and intertextuality between the pieces, thus providing much more cohesion within the circle as a whole than other conductors. All in all, this is a great recording. Thanks to all participants and, last but not least, to Supraphon for making it available. I suspect that this could be a small pressing. You might want to get your copy soon.",1350518400,5,2638,5.106481481481482
