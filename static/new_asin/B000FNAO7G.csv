2577190,4,B000FNAO7G,"Big Cat Challenge is an enjoyable wildlife DVD.  It does a good job of comparing 3 of Africa's top predators, the Lion, Leopard, and Cheetah, in their constant battle to survive.  If you're looking for showdowns between these super predators however you'll be disappointed.  The show's focus is more on the struggle against Nature, not each other.  In that vein the DVD is very good as an enjoyable way to see three super predators and compare their survival strategies and abilities in the worlds most unforgiving ring: Life!",1239062400,5,526,4.943181818181818
2577191,3,B000FNAO7G,"This video offers decent footage and average commentary for a nature documentary.  The best aspect is the price.  For $2, it is worth it.  The video does a good job of showing how the niches of leopards, lions, and cheetahs are different.  The strengths and weaknesses of these animals are explored.  Occasional shots of other animals, but mostly it is the three featured cats.",1162857600,9,377,4.828125

8124759,5,B000FNAO7G,"I love these types of documentaries. As others have said, the different animals don't actually fight each other. So don't expect that. They do compete for food though. There's an interesting dynamic between them. I won't spoil it for ya, but if you're enjoy big cats this documentary is very good.",1516406400,,297,4.8431372549019605

8124767,5,B000FNAO7G,"Here we have an up-close-and-personal look,
although brief, of three amazing predators,
lions, cheetahs and leopards,
coexisting on a nature preserve in South Africa.

I don't have anything negative to say about
this video other than it ought to be longer
because I didn't want it to end.

It is not for the overly sensitive viewer.
There is plenty of sex and gore.

The presentation focuses on the individual lives
of the three big cat types and how there lives
intersect.
It is a brutal existence.
Survival of the fittest indeed.
There is one instance where a lion kills
and eventually eats the cub of a lioness
who had mated with a lion outside of the pride.
There is another instance where it appears that
a leopard is eating a lion cub up in a tree,
but the narrator does not refer to it.

We witness stalking, hunting, eating, playing,
mating and parenting.
There are also direct challenges that always result
in surrender and flight rather than a fight,
the weaker recognizing its/their disadvantage,
its proper place in the hierarchy or some other reason.

There are many other animals shown briefly as well
when their lives are part of the lives of the big three.
Those includes prey and scavengers.

Alas, no tigers.

The video quality is very good from what appears
to be a relatively old film and this is a bargain
DVD, so the price is right.. I found it for $1.00
at a retail store and here on Amazon at this time
there are used copies for less than $1.00

If you like this type of nature documentary,
then you are guaranteed to like this one.",1314576000,,1556,4.551971326164875
