8325136,2,B000GL195S,"I thought the DVD would go more in depth into the life of Louis Delgado; however, that is not the case. I was expecting to hear some interviews from Louis Delgado and see some well detailed fights. Instead, all the DVD contains are few short clips from his early fights and a lengthy class that is filmed in his studio showing him teaching his black belt students. Not only does the image quality is somehow grainy and not very clear, the class is what the entire DVD is about basically (at least 97% of the DVD focus on that while the remaining 3% are just few clips of his fights).

I am somehow disappointed because I did not know who Louis Delgado was before, and I still do not know who he really is and what he has become. It would have been nice to have included in the DVD interviews from the like of Joe Lewis or even Chuck Norris. I give it 2 stars because I think the DVD could have had more information on Louis, more interviews, and more in depth fights.",1334188800,,967,4.227027027027027
