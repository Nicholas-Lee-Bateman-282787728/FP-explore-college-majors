7903253,5,B0000042KF,"This video contains the basic knowledge that every beginner guitarist absolutely must know to start becoming a technical musician. My playing has improved light years because of it.

DON LATARSKI is mild mannered and teaches in an extraordinarily organized and user-friendly way.

The last section (""modes"") is not nearly elaborate enough and seems out of place (filler?), but the rest of the video is so well executed, it deserves all 5 stars.

Contains the same well known quality editing and production as all the other REH/Warner Brothers instructional videos.

This is one of, if not THE best, beginner guitar/music theory videos on the market!  It may be out of print and it's definitely hard to find, but if you can, BUY IT!",1055894400,,731,4.959016393442623
