3714601,1,B000MGBM5O,"If you know anything about kickboxing (even fitness club style), the instructor's form in this video is terrible! I guess as long as you are getting a good workout from it...but I just can't get over that someone so inexperienced can have a video out there!",1360627200,5,257,4.608695652173913
3714602,5,B000MGBM5O,You get what you put in--this workout will leave me sore for days if I give it my 100%. I've been thrilled with this workout!,1360454400,2,125,4.04
3714603,2,B000MGBM5O,"I'm glad I was able to use this on amazon prime first, or I would have been really disappointed. This workout just seems really cheaply made, even though she's wearing a mic the whole time I can still hardly hear her. Their entrance in the video is weird, which I know has nothing to do with the workout but for me it's distracting. Some of the stuff in this was awkward for my body to do. I've done kickboxing videos before and I never had that problem. Other people seem to like this workout, but its a cheaply made one and your money might be better spent on a different one.",1359244800,,578,4.216216216216216
3714604,4,B000MGBM5O,"I was very pleased with this workout. The production values of the video are just okay (sometimes the music is louder than the instructor, and in some shots you can see the other camera and also people going up the stairs behind the curtain), but the workout itself is great.  I have been doing kickboxing videos for over a year and I doubt whether I could have done this workout without having tried other less challenging ones first. The cardio section has great combinations - challenging enough without being too difficult to follow. If you're a beginner and find this too challenging, then try something like ""10 minute solutions"" kickboxing with Kelli Roberts&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Kickbox-Bootcamp/dp/B000W3VD7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Kickbox Bootcamp</a>, , and then after getting used to the basic moves you can go back to this video and try again. My only concern is that the instructor's arms on her hook punches look a little high, and some of the moves look a little ""dance-y"" but other than that I love this workout.

Some info - the workout itself is about 45 minutes, not a full 55 minutes. 5 minute warm-up, 30 minutes of cardio, 10 minutes of core strengthening, and then the last 10 minutes shows short lessons on the proper form for the punches and kicks.",1358812800,39,1371,5.284403669724771
3714605,4,B000MGBM5O,"I used this video for the first time today. I have a long way to go before I can get through this video with any success.  I would think that 55 minutes would be a lot for a beginner. That said, the moves are very easy to follow and it is fast-paced and high energy.  The kicks were difficult for me, but I am hoping to keep on trying to improve. The only flaw with this program is that the sound is somewhat muffled because the instructor uses a headset and the sound is ""live"".  I simply had to turn up the volume, but for anyone with hearing impairment, it might be frustrating. The music is okay and repetitive, but it keeps you going - though maybe after 55 minutes it would be headache-inducing.",1358380800,3,701,4.2164179104477615
3714606,4,B000MGBM5O,"This is a good workout for beginners the previous 1star rating does not refer to the video but the fact that they can not burn it to a DVD. That is called piracy, buy the full DVD and you won't be disappointed or just rent it.",1357084800,5,226,3.9347826086956523
3714607,1,B000MGBM5O,"I've always know to read all of the information before purchasing an item, but lets face it many of us don't. I purchased this because I was stupid enough to think that I could download it to a dvd & watch it on my tv. (Let's face it who actually works out in front of a computer!!!!!!!!!) Well, you can't do that & I just wasted $10 on a movie that I thought I owned, yet I can't even get it to my TV!!!!!!!! Wow this kind of business really makes me angry....I think it is called bait & switch..",1263686400,,497,3.98
3714608,5,B000MGBM5O,"I am a beginner to kickboxing and this was just the dvd I needed to get me started.  While the kick and arm combos were hard to get down at first and I still have a hard time keeping up, it gives me a good workout.  Some say the music is kinda cheesy, but I found it motivating. The volume is kinda low, so I always have to turn it up louder, but I enjoy the dvd thoroughly to prepare me for tougher kickboxing in the future.  If you want to learn kicks and punches this is the dvd for you!  I'm a very satisfied customer",1213142400,4,521,3.8867924528301887

3714611,1,B000MGBM5O,"This workout could have been a lot of fun if it had been done correctly. The warm-up is easy to follow, and then the cardio falls apart.

3714619,2,B000MGBM5O,Around the 20 minute mark it became difficult to follow.  Even one of the support ladies got a little lost. The music drowns out the instructor's voice.  The support ladies seem to have better form than the instructor.  It was a good workout but I became too frustrated because I couldn't follow along.,1485302400,,302,4.660377358490566
3714620,3,B000MGBM5O,Not bad. Sound is a little shotty but it is a good workout. I will do it again.,1484870400,,79,3.4444444444444446

3714638,2,B000MGBM5O,"Moves not in synch with music - very annoying, since the beat is what helps you count and stay in the rhythm.

3714639,3,B000MGBM5O,"The instructors form was so bad, though the ""class"" we're better. The routines were ok and were quite effective.

3714643,4,B000MGBM5O,"Four stars because my arms were at least a bit sore the next day after doing this. The basic steps and ideas are consistent with what you might get in a class. However, some of the execution is a little off. I did a lot of in-person kickboxing classes and boxing classes, and the stances they show here are not great for actually landing a hit. (The posture for the cross for example, is an issue. A cross is a cross body punch, not a punch to the side. If I land a cross with my right hand, I'm still punching mostly forward. But, you can still do all the things they ask in here and do them with the proper stance. I didn't watch the segment at the END of the video that explains the punches and their posture, so newbies should watch that first. It's like the last 6 minutes.) These folks are more in tune with the aerobic/dance feel. That said, it is what you make of it, and the combinations of moves and speed required are good. If you're looking for a workout with arm movement that has good cardio and some strength work, it'll keep you busy.",1471219200,,1050,4.202970297029703

3714654,5,B000MGBM5O,"The production value was low, as other reviews have pointed out, but I'm not even going to take away a star for that. This video is FREE and offers a high quality, fun workout.

High impact enough to get your heart rate up, get you sweating. Perfect for those who want a moderate, full body amd cardio workout.

LOVE the instructor. He body is curvy and strong and made me feel better about my own body, which is naturally more like hers than some other female fitness instructors I've watch online or on DVDs. She reminded me that I don't need to be thin to be healthy and fit. Her overall personality throughout the video was awesome, too.",1465948800,6,641,4.423728813559322

3714659,5,B000MGBM5O,"Great instructor. Easy to follow moves helps to facilitate a fun workout for any ability (beginner or advanced). The cardio exertion created by the workout in not too extreme but depending on how much effort the user takes to perform the move, the cardio can be easily increased, which is a positive. The end of the actual workout has a segment to explain the punches and kicks, if necessary. My general impression is the workout is enjoyable because I could follow along easily; and I could increase my heart rate for my age level. Stacy Cronin's instructions are clear and easily followed. One participant follows a modified (easier) routine.",1464998400,,644,4.91743119266055
3714660,1,B000MGBM5O,This video is old and not motivational at all. I was expecting a better quality video and more updated stuff.,1464998400,,109,4.5

It reminded me of the pictures I took with my camera as a child and my finger would show up in the photographs.  Only watched approx. 10 minutes.",1463356800,,313,4.344827586206897

3714667,4,B000MGBM5O,"This is a good workout, at a good pace.  I would have given it a 5 star rating if I didn't have to listen so intently to the instructor.  She is not always easy to hear.",1463270400,,169,3.6666666666666665

3714670,4,B000MGBM5O,"This was a good workout!

I agree with the reviews that the sound quality was not great, but the instructor does a great job with cues and often shows new steps to sequences for a few beats before she then says ""join me,"" so you can watch and gather what's coming next.

The workout itself is a great moderate intensity blend of traditional fitness kickboxing moves and even a few tae-kwon-do movements. It's fairly low impact, and she keeps you moving steadily so you get a genuine cardio workout (rather than intervals of strength plus cardio, which are good, too, but if you're looking for a moderate-intensity, constant-movement cardio workout video, this is a great pick!). The workout ends with 10 minutes of core strengthening.",1462665600,8,734,4.864
3714671,5,B000MGBM5O,"I have to say, despite the not-so-great production value of this video, I really, really, really enjoyed it. Like, I caught myself smiling and laughing during the workout, even though I worked hard enough to break a sweat and be respectably sore the next day (wasn't sure the workout was tough enough at the time, but it appears to have been). I generally like working out and do it regularly, but I don't usually *smile* while I do it. Something about the attitude of the instructor and the clear rapport she has with her fellow kickboxers just charmed me. I liked how fun it was to pretend to be actually fighting someone, and simultaneously how they all joked about how silly it is to pretend to be actually fighting someone. I liked how easy it was to follow instructions for moves and sequences that are actually pretty complicated, especially for someone not terribly familiar with kickboxing sequences. Even when I couldn't hear well because of the not-so-great production value, I could still follow along. I think the instructor does a great job of setting up the moves. (First-timers note there's a form instructions bit at the end that's actually pretty helpful for angles and ""dont's""  and things like that.)

I also liked how all the women seem like real women, not professional dancers or yoga instructors. They had real-women bodies, and I found myself feeling empowered by them. The lead instructor isn't super skinny like most such instructors, but she's strong and fast, and I actually felt better about my own body and goals by the end of the video. I started thinking, I want to be like her, not like some impossibly thin model, and that's really healthy for a woman to think in this day and age. (I've recently given birth to twins, so it can be tough to be body positive knowing that my body is no longer physically capable of looking like a thin model's, if it ever was.)

Overall, this was a lot of fun. And it was FREE! I'll use it again--I'm sure of it.",1462320000,18,1979,4.632478632478633

It had an old style of workout with older stretching and workout techniques and moves. I have done so many kickboxing videos and the instructors form in this video is awful. I was shocked when I went back to the video to show my husband what I thought was a horrible 80's kickboxing video and the date on it is 2008.

  This workout had 4 women displaying various moves to include some demonstrating modified workouts for a lower impact opportunity.

  The video starts with a slow gradual warm up and builds up to more intense moves.  The instructor was easy to follow with regards to her instructions and easy to understand.  She encourages you to keep your feet moving in between new exercises.  When she transitions into a new exercise she demonstrates it twice before you join her with the routine.

  This is a good video for people to use at home.  Watching a video at home allows you some variety in your workout as well as you can pick what type of class and how long you want to workout.

3714801,5,B000MGBM5O,"I thought this was a fantastic workout.

1. I enjoy cardio workouts that engage muscles without being super high impact. This was an excellent combination of muscle engaging, heart pumping work without a lot of jumping and squatting (although there is a small amount, but minimal).

2. The audio isn't great, but it's still really easy to follow along, even when she incorporates combination moves.

3. It's fun to watch. She doesn't blather on forever and at times pokes fun at herself.

4. After the cardio, she has a nice ab workout that I also enjoyed, as well as a decent cooldown.

It's on Prime, so I will definitely be using this in my regular rotation of exercise dvds.",1429574400,5,678,4.663865546218488

3714807,2,B000MGBM5O,"First of all, let me say that despite all of its flaws, I have done this workout a few times now.  I used to go to a martial arts studio for cardio kickboxing, and I loved it.  It was a great workout, and very fast-paced.  Since I am now out of shape and just trying to get back to it, I thought I would work out at home and give this one a try.  I do like that the pace is slower.  It's great for someone who is either a beginner, or just trying to start getting back into shape.  However, this video has several points of irritation.

First of all, the sound is terrible.  The mic wasn't lined into the video recording, and the room they recorded it in has a lot of echoing.  This makes it very hard to hear and understand what the instructor is saying.  I have my volume turned up to 70 when it's on, and I still have a hard time understanding her.  Also, the music is not synced to their movements, so most of the time, they are going slower than the music.  I find that to be very distracting, and very annoying.  I end up doing more reps than they do because of it.  Secondly, the video editing is just downright pitiful.  In a couple of the frames, you can actually see the other camera off to the side.  Add to that, there's this one point where the instructor asks that you watch what she's doing a couple of times so that you can then join her.  Unfortunately, during the whole time you're supposed to be watching her, the cameras are zoomed in on her background ladies, who are not doing what the instructor is doing.  Then, right when the correct camera zooms out back to her, she says, ""Alright, let's go!"" (Or something like that).  And of course, since the sound is bad, it's not like it's easy to understand what she is telling you to do while she's off camera.

So with all of that said, I still do the workout.  After a couple of times, it gets easier to follow, since I'm remembering more and more of it. I try not to look at them when they are behind the tempo of the music and just focus on what I'm doing, since it still works okay in the sense that it offers a guideline to follow.  And at the end of it, I feel like I got a decent workout.  Are there better videos out there?  Absolutely.  But this one streams for free on Amazon Prime.  You get what you pay for, I guess.  :)",1428278400,,2300,4.098654708520179

3714885,4,B000MGBM5O,"Yes, the audio is off.  Yes the quality of the video is poor.  What is important, however, is that it is a good workout.  I have been with this for almost 90 days now and have to say it gives a great all over workout.  I like the modifications for people like me that might have some issues with high impact workouts.  The instructor is not some bubbly perky over enthusiatic bimbo who makes you want to turn it off after 30 seconds.  It is a solid workout for people looking to workout.  People have really noticed a difference in my weight and fitness since starting this as well.  My shoulders look better than they have in years and I actually have some nice, strong abs plus my calf muscles look great.  If you want perky high end studio stuff, this is not for you.  If you want a solid workout which gets results, this is an excellent video.",1394409600,,847,4.270440251572327

I am in my mid 40s, and this was an excellent high intensity workout that was low impact on my back and knees.  I had never kickboxed before, so i reviewed the brief tutorial that was at the end.  After that, the leader was easy to follow.  The fact that it was free with Prime was a bonus.",1392336000,,388,4.0394736842105265

I wear a heart rate monitor that also tracks my calories burned.  I had trouble getting my heart rate up and didn't even break a sweat until the routine was over halfway finished.  I might consider this routine as a body sculpting alternative but I wouldn't use it as my daily source of cardio.  I was very disappointed.",1392336000,,478,4.448275862068965

I felt challenged and felt great at the end of the workout.  I would do this workout many more time.  Only recommendation is that they would of put the helpful hints on how to do certain kicks and punches at the beginning of the video instead of at the end.

However, the instructor speaks so softly that you cannot properly hear her over the music that is playing in the background. So, you can't really follow her or prepare for moves because you have to watch to see what to do. As a result, any instruction regarding form or other things is completely missing.

3714906,5,B000MGBM5O,As someone who used to practice Tae Kwon Do years ago- I really enjoyed this video! I recommend those who are not familiar with Kick boxing or Tae Kwon Do- to go to the last 5 min. of this video- they give instructions on how to do the moves properly. If you have proper technique you get a good workout with this video. As others said- the studio recording is not the best-but it's not bad. I am happy these girls made the video and glad there is something different out there besides all the biggest looser videos. Nice work.,1384819200,,527,4.28

3714908,4,B000MGBM5O,"Challenging and fun, this workout video is not at all boring. The music goes along great with the video and keeps you pumped. I feel like Rocky when I am doing this workout. The only reason for chopping one star is that the proper techniques for punches and kicks are shown after the workout ends, and the sound quality is scratchy in a couple of places when the instructor is talking.",1383696000,,385,4.436619718309859
3714909,5,B000MGBM5O,I like this video. I have pretty bad osteoarthritis in my knees and have had 4 surgeries. I had to give up doing most of my Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos because my knees just couldn't handle how quickly he change moves and some of the various lunges and squats. I find that this video gives me a great leg workout and there's only one kick that I can't do (and I can do it if I do the easier modified version). Best workout video I have done in a while.,1379548800,3,452,3.978021978021978

3714914,5,B000MGBM5O,"This is a great kick-boxing work-out.  It's not a class in the martial art of kick-boxing, ok.  But it is the moves, and includes a lot of reps, so the muscles needed for the martial art are developed.  I think if a person wants to learn the martial art, they ought to consider investing in a course from a certified school.  If you want to get your body ready for the course, use dvd's like this one.  And this is one of the best, again, because of the number of reps.  And the fact that she uses moves low to the ground that really work the legs and abs.

3714916,1,B000MGBM5O,"I thought I'd give this a try because it got so many good reviews and it's free to watch with Prime Instant Video. I was extremely disappointed.

For starters, this is a YouTube quality video. I mean SHOCKINGLY badly made.  The background is tacky photography backdrops hung from poles (which you can often see due to sloppy camera angles), and then littered with whatever fake plants they could find in whatever office building this was filmed in. The video and sound equipment is frequently hanging into the picture (again, just sloppy!). The instructor is wearing a mike, but it's obviously just a prop as the audio is echoey and very difficult to hear over the ambient noise of the room. This is really the biggest production issue as it makes it extremely hard to understand what the instructor is saying and follow along.

The workout itself was unimpressive and focused WAY too long on one side before switching. I was so frustrated with the garbled speech and unclear instruction for mediocre moves I only made it about half way through before shutting it off. I don't have an hour to waste on quality this poor.

If you have Prime Instant Video and can watch this for free and have time to waste, MAYBE give it a try (it has several good reviews so obviously some people like it) but do not, =DO NOT= SPEND MONEY ON THIS VIDEO! You can get many professional, well made fitness videos for the same price and you'll actually get your money's worth. I hardly think that the people who made this spent $9.99, you most certainly shouldn't either!",1371772800,,1550,4.645985401459854

3714919,4,B000MGBM5O,"This was a great workout.  I agree with others that the film quality was ok at best and sound was bad, (that is why 4 stars, instead of 5) but the instructor was motivating, not obnoxious, or over peppy.  I also like how fit and strong the instructor and helpers looked.  I like how the instructor also gave an eight count of the next move before transitioning.
For those of you who are new to kickboxing there is punch break down at the end of the video.  Would have been better at the beginning.
Overall, great workout and will be using it again.",1366761600,,548,4.29126213592233

3714927,3,B000MGBM5O,"I read some other reviews about this workout before trying it myself.  It was pretty funny to watch the amateurish way the video was produced.  You can see people walking up the stairs in the background and it's obvious the wall hangings in the background are just sheets hung to block a window.  It's hard to hear Stacy at times even though she's wearing a mic.  And it's also pretty obvious they didn't practice before shooting the video since at least one of the messes up all the time.

Even with all the funny mistakes, the video was still challenging enough to get your heart rate up.  This would not be a good workout for anyone with a moderate amount of kickboxing experience.  This would be better for either a novice, or someone with very little experience.

I found the video fun and worth the time.  Plus, it was free.  Seriously, it's good enough for me with that price tag :)",1361145600,27,889,4.46583850931677
3714928,2,B000MGBM5O,"This is a decent workout--the kicks and punches work up a great sweat. The problem is the video production. The leader is almost impossible to hear through most of the workout because of a terrible echo in the room and one of her assistants randomly yelling over her (not in sequence with kicks, as in real TKD, most of the time). The other thing that got me was that the class leader does different moves than the women behind her and besides what she says to do--she throws in extra little bounces and jabs and movements that are confusing.

I'd do this workout again, but I wouldn't buy it unless they cleaned up at least the sound.",1361145600,,635,4.427350427350428

They don't explain the moves much so you need some familiarity with kickboxing punches--cross, jab, hook, upper--and how to kick without hurting your back. But the advantage of that is the class moves fast instead of slowing down to demonstrate each move. You have to go through to the abs section to get the stretching which I would recommend.
