7912654,3,B00000JMOK,"During the ten years that followed her successful debut as a hot teenager in ""Blame It On Rio"" opposite Michael Caine (1984), Michelle Johnson didn't seem to get lucky on any role she landed (including her double role in this not-so-cool thriller). Then she got married to baseball star Matt Williams in early 1999 and was given another chance in ""Fallen Angel"" (aka ""Revenge"") opposite Alexandra Paul, which turned out a surprisingly entertaining thriller. That being said, I suggest you check out ""Fallen Angel"" and enjoy Michelle's acting, unless you're more into her other assets (in that case, ""Blame It On Rio"" remains an all-time treat to the eyes).",1020556800,8,656,5.027522935779817
7912655,5,B00000JMOK,"Micky Dane (Robert Patrick), a paparazzo photographer, is on the run after a photo shoot that leaves him framed for murder. This movie has great action, good acting and really catchy music. Body Shot is another Robert Patrick movie that I've seen multiple times(probably about 12 so far and still counting).  You gotta love Patrick with his blond hair! I AM biased and give this a perfect 5 stars.",986947200,6,397,4.753623188405797
