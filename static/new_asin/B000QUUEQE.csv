8197699,5,B000QUUEQE,"The eighth volume of ""Super Robot Wars OG: Divine Wars"" is another exciting volume in the series and as usual with the series, there was a lot of action and mecha battles galore!

But there are some problems when you think about the concept of time and part of the problem is when you have so many characters, where a mecha series such as ""Gundam"" has over 40-50 episodes, they are able to flesh out the story with more character development and even budding relationships. Also, there is a sense of time of how many days or weeks things have passed.

With this volume, Kusuha is now a pilot of the Grungust Type-2 and willing to go to battle. But how long has she actually been training. A day, days, weeks? Ryune Zoldark is concerned with the incarceration of the SRX team but since she was just let on aboard the Hagwane, without that much character development for her, would Ryune really be that concerned? So, perhaps she has been friends with Ryusei and Rai for days or weeks?

But another problem which I mentioned in previous review and again becomes a major pet peeve is the sense of death. With the battle of the Aerogaters, the Earth Federation Army and the civilians become casualties. Soldiers who pilot an airplane or drive a tank are the ones that are typically killed in battle.

But not one major character has been killed. They have been injured but well enough for battle in a few days with no lasting ramifications from injuries.

We have seen death for United Colony Corps and Divine Crusaders characters but even in this volume where Aya is shot point blank, she survives and is hospitalized and is ready to go battle by the end of the volume.

No one dies, no one gets majorly injured and with every death that we have seen on the ""good"" side of a mecha series, the death makes an impact.

And so you wonder what if ""Super Robot Wars OG: Divine Wars"" has had the chance to get a 40-50 episode treatment. Character development and even budding relationships can be furthered explored but at least there would be a sense of timing.

But with that being said, the end of the ""Super Robot Wars OG: Divine Wars"" is the next volume and volume 8 which features a major character betrayal was exciting and to see the turn against the fellow teammates was quite riveting.

Overall, this is a 26-episode series and Kakudo Hiroyuki and staff has done what they can to fit everything they can in a short time. It's a bit sad to know that there is one more volume left in the series but so far, I have been entertained. The series although not perfect, is still riveting, action-packed and explosive.

I look forward to the final volume!",1218240000,,2648,4.509394572025053
