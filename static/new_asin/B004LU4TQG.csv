8434840,1,B004LU4TQG,"I ordered this particular set of movies for my husband for Christmas.  We had seen two of these movies and thought they are hilarious.  The first order I received was the wrong 3 movies.  I really wanted the older movies that are clearly specified on the order.  I contacted Amazon and I returned the incorrect set.  A few days later, I received another set and it was still the wrong 3 movies.  I decided that they weren't going to get this right, so I just asked for a refund.  I was very disappointed.  You shouldn't offer a DVD set with specific movies and then send something entirely different.",1326067200,,600,4.4907407407407405
