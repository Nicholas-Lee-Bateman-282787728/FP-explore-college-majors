6201624,5,B00HRYH6GI,"This movie is by far the best story of the life of Jesus.  I was familiar with the original Classic movie of JESUS but now with the re-master it makes the movie seem BRAND NEW.  It has an awesome clear picture, sound, and transitions.  Great for ministry use, churches, evangelism, your neighbor or family & friends.",1391385600,36,316,4.607142857142857

6201626,3,B00HRYH6GI,"This both is and isn't the version that I grew up with on VHS as a kid. Let me explain-- the original film has been restored in glorious HD and includes additional/alternate scenes that weren't in the version that I had on VHS, however all of the dialogue from the actors and all of the music have been rerecorded. They may have done this because the original sound negative couldn't be restored as nicely as the picture, but I find it very distracting and unsatisfying. But at the same time, this version is still worth getting for the additional scenes and beautiful picture.",1515542400,,577,4.611650485436893

6201629,5,B00HRYH6GI,"This is not the original audio. This is ENGLISH dubbed over ENGLISH. I'm not joking. It's like buying your favorite song only to find that it's a karaoke version. This is my favorite movie and I've been watching it for years. It had an effect similar to seeing cats crow like roosters and birds bark like dogs. I actually went out and purchased a blu-ray player just to watch this movie. As we were driving back to the electronics store to return the player we'll no longer need, we concluded that money had to be the underlying reason. I'm totally disappointed and bummed. They weren't even using the same exact words in some places. I could only get through a few minutes so I can't even tell you if they even bothered to stick to the script in the end. Still, its the best, most-viewed movie of all time.",1502582400,,807,4.422818791946309

6201631,5,B00HRYH6GI,"The Jesus Film (1979) is simply amazing in countless aspects.  First and foremost, it depicts the life of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, from birth to death/resurrection/ascension, as written in the Gospel of Luke, which presents more of Jesus' life in its entirety.  The acting is superb, especially that from leading actor Brian Deacon, as is the picture and sound quality on this Blu-ray DVD.  This version, the 35th anniversary of the film's release, contains very noticeable image enhancements; it is much sharper than the original, and the colors are brighter and more radiant.  In addition, this version is in widescreen and contains a new musical score and sound effects.  If you are looking for the perfect biblical drama about the life of Jesus Christand without profound violence (though your eyes may still fill with tears during the Crucifixion scenes)then look no further; this DVD is definitely for you.",1500508800,,917,5.086666666666667

6201637,4,B00HRYH6GI,There are several dubbed versions free online but I prefer the original DVD format. I showed this to my class however I am very disappointed in the politically correct editing of this movie. Why did they delete the pig scene (Luke 8:33) where the pigs fall over the cliff and into the lake? It's in the Bible. Why would anyone be offended if it is an accurate portrayal of the Biblical story? I find this ridiculous. The scene is in the original version that one can look up online.,1490659200,,482,4.426966292134831

6201645,5,B00HRYH6GI,This movie is My Testimony because when I was working out my relationship with God. I saw this movie and it is very good how Jesus forgave Mary Magdalene of her sins.

6201655,5,B00HRYH6GI,"This fully remastered version of the Jesus film is great.  The picture quality is much improved and clearer in scenes such as Gabriel's annunciation to Mary, John the Baptist's preaching at the Jordan, Christ's call of Peter and the miraculous catch of fish, Christ's raising of Jairus' daughter, Christ's Transfiguration, Christ's teaching and travels with both His male and female disciples, and the Resurrection of Christ.  There are also added scenes in the Gospel of Luke which were not in the previous versions of the Jesus Film:

1) Jesus answers the rich young ruler who asks Him ""what must I do to gain eternal life?"" / Jesus answers, ""Sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasures in heaven"" (Luke 18:18-25).  Jesus and His disciples then cross a road where 3 men are crucified in the foreground.
2) Jesus tells His disciples the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)
3) Jesus rides a donkey and enters Jerusalem with His disciples waving palm branches and shouting ""Hosanna to the Son of David"" (Luke 19:28-40)
4) Jesus commends the widow who gave the two copper coins for giving more than all the wealthy people did (Luke 21:1-4)
5) Jesus answers the chief priests and the scribes who challenge his authority and Jesus tells them the Parable of the Wicked Tenants (Luke 20: 1-19)
6) Jesus answers the question about paying taxes to Caesar (Luke 20: 20-26)
7) Jesus celebrates the Last Supper with His disciples and tells them the meaning of the bread and the cup (Luke 22:14-23)

These added scenes add so much because they are faithful depictions of these important Scriptural teachings and events in the Gospel of Luke.  The Jesus film has been very useful to show to groups during Bible studies and evangelistic outreaches because it presents a faithful representation of the Scriptural passages in the Gospel of Luke.

Some other details: The music score is much better than the previous version (which I thought sounded goofy at times).  The added special features (Impact of the Jesus Film, and Making of the Jesus Film) were very interesting and informative.  The Impact of the Jesus Film documentary mentions that 200 million people all around the world believed in Jesus as their Savior and Lord as a result of watching the Jesus Film!

I am so glad that this important film about the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ has been updated and remastered -- this movie is one of the most accurate depictions of Christ's life and ministry, based upon the Gospel of Luke.  This is the definitive version to own, and it is also less expensive than the previous versions of the Jesus film!  Highly recommended!!",1482537600,,2663,4.815789473684211

6201658,4,B00HRYH6GI,"Varies from the scripture some, but overall a decent representation.  I did not like the sinner's prayer at the end, that's why it only got 4 stars.  The sinner's prayer isn't scriptural and folks are being deceived by this method of evangelism.  Their salvation becomes based on their decision or feelings at the time.  Only God knows when someone is truly repentant and has placed all their faith and trust in Jesus.  We cannot chose when and where to be saved.",1482105600,2,463,4.666666666666667

6201660,1,B00HRYH6GI,"Lots of Scripture -- Little to no Heart. For a movie that quotes so much Scripture, I am truly offended by the Scripture that is purposely left out. Viewers come away from this movie with a very shallow understanding of the real Jesus who walked this earth, and the love He shared first with His family, and then with His followers and all people. Every one of the other movies I have seen on the life and times of Jesus is much, much better than this one. No, I won't be keeping it nor can I give it away, and at $3.74 it's not even worth the trouble returning it. I highly recommend buying ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and/or ""Mary of Nazareth"" instead.",1482019200,,646,4.30327868852459

So much love and warmth, emanate from him, even a twinkle in his eye for the children, that it's hard to believe he's not Jesus. Having been to the Holy Land, I recognized that it was made there. The fish caught in the net are the fish in early Christian mosaics that I'd never seen before. No Hollywood enhancements to scripture, but faithful, which makes it all the more wonderful.  This version has many young children in it, so it's a good choice to show to your children or grandchildren. Wonderful acting throughout. You'll love it!",1454630400,,662,4.516666666666667

They said the narrator is a different person than the original we had, and it is--it is the guy who narrates the beginning that was added to the original film.  Comes with additional scenes not found in the version distributed free by our church.  A great addition to any Christian library!",1444780800,,331,4.576271186440678
6201715,5,B00HRYH6GI,"We purchased this video because it was remastered.  Having watched the older DVD version, I doubted that there would be much improvement over the picture after all these years.  Wow, were we in for a shock!  This picture looks wonderful!  Obviously, someone was smart enough almost 40 years ago to make sure that the original prints were kept safe and sound.  This widescreen presentation and restored picture is like watching a brand new movie.

The sound is equally incredible.  They have created a brand new musical score with 5.1 sound and it blows the old version out of the water.

I am sure that the majority of the people thinking about buying the Blu Ray version have seen the film before and probably own a video or DVD copy.  The main reason to ""upgrade"" a copy of this movie is all about picture and sound quality.  So, if you have enjoyed the Jesus film over the years, this is a no brainer.

Yes, it is WELL worth it to upgrade to the restored version.  The price is a bargain and you truly will feel like you are watching a brand new movie.  Usually, the only time an older movie is worth an upgrade to Blu Ray is when a major studio spends lots of $$$ to methodically restore it frame by frame.  My concern was that since this was a Christian film not produced by a major studio, that they simply would not invest the time and resources it would take to truly restore this film.  Well, they did it!  And they did it very well.

In my opinion, you owe it to yourself and your family to get a copy right away, sit back.......and let the words of the Lord Jesus fill your home.  I'm SO glad i purchased this restored version.  You will be too.",1441324800,10,1656,4.335504885993485

No majesty in the characters and actually a way too dark portrayal of Jesuschrist. Nothing at all like ""King of Kings"" the masterpiece. Not worthy of being included in a time capsule for future generations. Give me movies like ""King of Kings"" and ""The Ten Commandments"" (with Heston) any time. This movie?

6201875,5,B00HRYH6GI,I bought this for sentimental reasons.  When my daughter was much younger we had the VHS version.  She watched it almost non-stop for several months and that is when she decided to give her life to Christ.  The audio sounds a little disjointed because they literally only speak the scripture but that is also why you can trust it.  There is nothing added or taken away.  I highly recommend this for all ages.,1410134400,,408,4.534246575342466
6201876,5,B00HRYH6GI,"25 years ago, this film was made to show Word of God to people in more than 200 countries and dubbed in almost 1200 languages,  You can be confident that it has not been slanted to any one interpretation of the Bible -- pastors from a huge number of denominations trust the accuracy of this film.  I was very pleased with the acting and since it was filmed in the holy lands, it is an excellent teaching tool.  If you already love God's Word, you want ""see"" it, or you want to present it as a gift, it is probably the best purchase you'll ever make.  For 35 years, since 1979, this film has proven itself to be an amazingly effective witnessing tool.  To explain better, below is an excerpt from the film's website, JesusFilm.org, though I would encourage you to go and look for yourself.

""It is the power of the Word of God in their heart language.""
  ""Based on the Gospel of Luke, the ""JESUS"" film has now been dubbed in more than 1,200 languages, with new languages being added every month. This allows Gods Word to speak to people in more than 200 countries in languages they know and understand. By Gods grace, it is yielding a spiritual harvest of unprecedented results.""",1408320000,3,1178,4.446511627906977
6201877,4,B00HRYH6GI,"I was hoping for the old version remastered in widescreen and HD. I pretty much got that but they updated the narrator, which sounded a bit different. They added a lot of scenes which were not in the old one, such as Jesus and the Apostles on the Mount of Transfiguration, way cool. The clarity is great, I hate to give 4 stars but they should have left the narrator alone and not edited it as much.",1407974400,,399,4.194805194805195
6201878,5,B00HRYH6GI,Simply a classic. I replaced my old VHF with this DVD as it's a good reminder of what Jesus did for us as well as a good movie to show people who don't know the Lord yet.,1407110400,,170,3.6216216216216215
6201899,5,B00HRYH6GI,"The Jesus Film is about the life of Jesus that is based on the Gospel of St. Luke. This was said to be the most watched film about Jesus of all-time and it has been translated in more than a thousand languages despite the fact that is far from the best film ever made about the messiah. It is monotonous,dry and boring. It also has low production values and most of the voices were dubbed except by Brian Deacon himself who played Jesus. But inspite of the flaws that I have stated,I still felt that it stayed true to the message of Christianity. Also,it managed to become effective in spreading the Good News. That is what this movie is all about. Aside from that,we also get to realize the teachings of Jesus whether one is a Christian or a non-Christian.
It may not be a movie that would meet our so-called expectations in terms of production values but it managed to be sincere in staying true to the teachings of Jesus.",1406332800,,924,4.409356725146199

6201970,5,B00HRYH6GI,"Having seen this film over the years, I can say that this movie has never looked and sounded better than it does on this blu-ray remaster. It's like watching it again for the very first time.

Having said that, the message of the story itself is intact from it's origins, and Brian Deacon does a fantastic job at portraying our savior in a way faithful to scripture. Further, the writers' painstaking work is noted and documented in the special features, and if for no other reason than to nod to them where credit is due, those supplements are worth a look.

So, if you have a friend who has never become acquainted with Jesus, and you wish to take that next step to answer their questions where scripture can be a bit overwhelming, and other films like ""The Passion of the Christ"" are too gory, this film is exactly the right tool for that introduction, so that your friend might then hunger for further knowledge, with the ultimate hope of salvation through the only way, that is, through The One True God, The Holy Living Messiah, our Loving Shepherd Jesus Christ.

6201973,5,B00HRYH6GI,I love this remastered movie.  If you ever were even slightly interested in what Christianity is all about...this movie unfolds the story of God's love for all of us so that we might have hope.  In 1997 we brought it to a city in Siberia and with the assist of a 13 inch TV we showed it to over 25 young people who had never seen the story (the words are from the Book of Luke in the Bible).  And we watched as tears flowed and they understood the story was written for all mankind to hope and treasure.  What a rare word in our world today...hope...and  this new Blu-ray version is beautiful.  Well worth having and sharing.,1400198400,,625,4.254237288135593

That is what I like most about it.  It is a solid well done movie.
After the 1979 run was over, it was released to the Jesus Film Project which translated it first to Tagalog (a Filipino language) and  showed it all over Northern Luzon (the main Filipino island).

I've had a couple copies of the film, and have given several of them away over the years, and watch it periodically. When I saw the new release being offered in Blu-ray I wondered if it would really be enhanced much, as I've seen some Blu-ray films that don't really look all that good. But I just got mine today and it is fantastic. I don't know how they did it but the Blu-ray is really outstanding High Definition. I haven't had time to compare the Extra Features yet to see if there are new ones, but am very anxious to watch the entire film soon, again.
