2862,5,0736925856,"An amazing book dealing with Bible Prophecy and current events. These two authors continue to produce excellent commentary on how news headlines fall into line with the predictions of the prophets as guided by God in His Holy Word. This book quotes middle east and U.S. leaders to show that Israel and Jerusalem remain the very center of the universe in God's plan for His earth. The book is very well written as expected from Dr. Ankerberg and easily understod. Many relative questions are answered in the last chapters, also.",1260835200,20,527,4.866666666666666
2863,2,0736925856,"John Ankerberg and Jimmy DeYoung come together to create ""Israel Under Fire: The Prophetic Chain of Events That Threatens the Middle East,"" a book that promises to explain the Biblical predictions concerning the current events in Israel, how what happens in Israel affects the rest of the world, and answers the age old question, ""Will there ever be peace in the Middle East."" To come to these answers Ankerberg and DeYoung interview - on location in Israel and the Middle East - many of the policy makers and experts who would be close to the situation, such as, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel and Reuven Rivlin, the Speaker of the Knesset in Israel.

Ankerberg and DeYoung are less authors than interviewers for much of the book (and interviewees, as I will explain.) The authors claim that the book will answer questions and give a biblical basis for the current events in Israel. To accomplish these goals the authors provide a brief history how the modern state of Israel came to be, what exactly is currently happening in Israel. On these points, I found that the authors were successful. Unfortunately, this was only the one part of the book.

In the second part of the book, the authors interview current world leaders and here is where I feel the books goes awry. I had two issues here. First, the authors advertise on the back cover that they interview Adnan Husseini, Yasser Arafat's cousin and Palestinian Authority spokesman.' It is true. But this is a little misleading as he is one of three world leaders advertised yet he appears in only one very short section with only a couple of questions, while the others leaders, Jewish pundits exclusively, are interviewed extensively. This is far from balanced coverage.

Second, the authors didn't just interview pundits they agreed with - they also interviewed each other. I understand that the authors may be experts in a field but their opinions should be bolstered by other expert's opinions, statistics, reports and the like. Author's opinions should not be proved by their own opinions. The issue of lack of documentation and proof isn't just relegated to their opinions in interviews. Unfortunately, the authors take comments and opinions from pundits they agree with for granted, moving right past controversial quotes that cry out for data that reinforces the opinion. The only reference in the book to an outside source (other than the Bible) is on page 156 (of 174).

In the third section of the book, the authors attempt to tie current events with Biblical prophecy. I would expect that anyone, after reading this book, even someone who has no experience with Biblical prophecy or current events, would be able to walk away understanding the ""prophetic chain of events that threaten the Middle East."" What I found in this section, though, was confusion. To explain a complicated book like Revelation, I would expect we would start at the beginning and work our way through the (purported) time line from start to finish. I would expect that current events would be tied in to the timeline to show how the events fit into the puzzle. I would expect that the authors would show how these events work together to fulfill prophecy. Unfortunately, Ankerberg and DeYoung did not make a convincing connection for me.

While I did find the first section of the book interesting, this book left me unsatisfied in my search for connections between current events and Biblical prophecy. Revelation itself is already difficult to understand and I found the authors didn't accomplish their goal of making it accessible and understood by the novice.

As much as I would have liked to, I cannot recommend this book to anyone but the expert Bible prophecy student.
