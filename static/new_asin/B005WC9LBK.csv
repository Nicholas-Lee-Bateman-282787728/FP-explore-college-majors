4898987,5,B005WC9LBK,"I can't believe this well done documentary seems to be so little known or watched.  It is a must-see for any fan of Louisa May Alcott and gives some significant insights into this woman who gave us the ""great favorites"" that made her famous, but also the darker ""secret life"" works which were done under an assumed name and many of which will probably never be known.

She is one of my best-loved authors and I was first introduced to her at 11 years old when a classmate gave me a copy of EIGHT COUSINS for Christmas.  I devoured it but at that young age, I didn't know that she had written other books, so I read and re-read EIGHT COUSINS every year of my childhood / adolescence.  I didn't discover her other works until I was an adult and began where I left off with ROSE IN BLOOM.  So the books that so many young girls read as children were some of the great favorites of my adult life.  Unlike others, I ended with LITTLE WOMEN, which I didn't read until my late 50s.  To this day, I still read EIGHT COUSINS and ROSE IN BLOOM every year!

After being steeped in the idealistic stories that she wrote, I find it extremely sad to know that her real life was hard and grievous.  But it also gives me some perspective and a context for the beloved stories that she left for us.  They are an escape for her readers.  My guess is that she never found her own escape.",1451606400,19,1368,4.223076923076923

4898991,5,B005WC9LBK,"I enjoyed this episode very much, as Louisa May Alcott is one of my favorite writers! The dialogue was all in her own words, from journal entries and from her books. I didn't know a lot of detail about her, but I did recognize many of the passages, especially from Hospital Sketches. The voice actors did a great job. I truly felt transported to the 1800's.

4898997,5,B005WC9LBK,"When I was 11 years old, I was given Little Women for Christmas, and it was the best present I ever got.  This documentary/biography of Louisa May Alcott does an exceptional job of giving access to Louisa's complicated life and character. A lot of information is packed into the  deceptively simple sequences of the film.  I had I known that Louisa grew up in poverty, which in part was softened by the intellect and imagination  of the family, but I had never fully grasped the degree of success that Loisa had accomplished as an adult.  The fortune she earned would make her a multi- millionaire by today's standards. Nor did I know that her youngest sister, May, bequeathed her only child, ""Lulu,"" to be raised by Louisa after May died when Lulu was 6 weeks old.  The film was delightful, and left me eager to learn more about the author of one of my favorite children's novels, which I think in itself is evidence that the film was successful as a mini-biography.",1509667200,,967,4.593023255813954

I really enjoyed getting the information about Alcott. And I have to believe, as it was implied but not confirmed, that with her passion and imagination - at some point, or maybe more than one, she had to have had a love affair.....I will be 64 in a few days, and finding out that she wrote so many other books is going to send me to the library to see what her fertile mind came up with!!!

No doubt, like many other women born in this era, Ms. Alcott managed to maintain her role as the provider for her family and pursue writing though she must have suffered what many economically stressed women endured at that time in American history--work out of necessity rather by choice.

4899090,4,B005WC9LBK,I  enjoyed this production. My main gripe is that it was too short to thoroughly explore the life and times of Louisa May Alcott. I gathered more information by reading short biographies. Perhaps I am too used to the Ken Burns style documentaries on PBS but at times this felt like it was missing an objective third voice.

4899093,5,B005WC9LBK,"This was a very interesting account of Louisa May Alcott's life.  It showed how universal struggles were for women back then, and how there was some indication that LMA was bi-polar.  It was good that the significance of historical matters, e.g. the abolitionist and and universalist movements, were included.  There was a good degree of complexity and irony in LMA's life, as she was born to a somewhat privileged life, yet had more than her share of hardships and struggles.

4899147,5,B005WC9LBK,"Through Alcott's own words, her life is dramatized.  It is SO interesting, it keeps one's attention riveted from beginning to end.  Mostly she wrote for money and was an extremely prolific writer.  Of course I was most interested in ""Little Women"", and it was fascinating to see that she came from a family of four girls.  She had a sister (""Amy"") that was a praised artist.  She had a sister like Beth who died, but left out the heartbreaking sinister details of her real-life death.  ""Marmie"" was a lot like her real mother.  I was fortunate enough to tour Orchard House, the Alcott home in Concord, Mass.  Up in ""Amy's"" bedroom, there are sketches all over the walls as she yearned to be the artist she would become.  The Alcotts were extremely poor and Louisa took on any respectable work to keep money coming in.  Louisa never married, but she lived!  She traveled, and one trip was to Europe where she had a dalliance with a much younger man.  Her family knew the famous thinkers of the era, who lived in Concord.  She was ahead of her time in many ways.  Her death came too soon and was brought about by doing a self-less good deed.  She was an amazing woman I admire.  I saw this twice and will probably see it again.",1460937600,,1225,4.426008968609866
4899148,5,B005WC9LBK,"I first read ""Little Women"" when I was ten and the rest of her works in our public library system within six months.  I love her more to know she did everything for her family.  I am sad that she died before she could do what she really wanted to do.  I'm revisiting my own life to see if I'm living my best life doing what I really want to do.",1460764800,,344,3.816901408450704

4899156,5,B005WC9LBK,"This dramatized life of Louisa May Alcott, along with commentary from Alcott scholars (who are interesting in themselves), was obviously a labor of love on the part of everyone who worked on it. The film demonstrates that she was a deeper and more complicated woman than the sentimentalized author of Little Women that we all grew up with. We also learn about the intensity of the utopian, transcendentalist and abolitionist movements of 19th century America. What an fascinating period in American history that was. Well worth watching!",1459468800,2,537,5.183908045977011

O/W, no new information, but still interesting. I appreciated that there was more attention given to Bronson Alcott, who seemed to be a bit egocentric.

4899237,5,B005WC9LBK,"Having read and enjoyed Little Women in elementary school I decided to watch this documentary because I realized I knew very little about Louisa May Alcott.  I was completely surprised by the Louisa May Alcott portrayed by Elizabeth Marvel. What I enjoyed the most about this production was that the words were taken directly from her own writings, or writings of those who knew her.  Although I knew Alcott had patterned the character of Jo after herself and the Little Women sisters after her own sisters, I was not aware that they had all experienced such dire financial hardship growing up and into adulthood.  Her father's lifelong inability to provide for his family and his difficult relationship with Louisa, at least in her earlier years, were very different aspects of his character compared to that of the father portrayed in Little Women.  Although their relationship improved once she proved herself to be a worthy individual by serving as a nurse during the Civil War (and almost dying), it was her fame as an author of children's books that really changed his attitude toward her.  Although Alcott never married she did share a love interest in mid-life with a younger man from Poland whom she met during a trip to Europe. She also ended up raising her sister May's daughter, whom she called ""LuLu"", after May died of childbed fever.  Although Alcott was an Abolitionist and a Feminist, it was her faithfulness to her own expectations of herself as well as her faithfulness to her family that really defined her and made her's an unexpected life.",1457740800,6,1561,4.871698113207547

4899260,5,B005WC9LBK,"This was well thought out, demonstrating how everything in her childhood including the revolutionary ideas on education and childhood were significant to her future success as a writer. I appreciated how the narrator repeated the names of Thoreau, Emerson, and others to emphasize the milieu of minds she was exposed to in her development. To me, the most dramatic event was not the Civil War nursing, not the typhoid, not her sister passing on, not even the enormous amount of money her books brought in, but it was that she burned her life's worth of journals that she based her published works on, protecting her family and friends from being exposed to public scrutiny.

It also tells us a much more detailed account of Louisa's life, including her many publications, her time spent as a nurse during the Civil War, a love interest, and her attachment to her family.  i was amazed to find out that she was the financial support for the family for many years, and before that, about the generosity and intellectual support of Emerson and Thoreau that kept the family from dire poverty.  Like many readers, I identified with Jo in Little Women, and the excellent portrayal of Louisa by Elizabeth Marvel,--the film contained reenactments, and scenes set in actual settings where the family lived-- makes it entirely feasible that Louisa May Alcott was the real Jo, a loving, imaginative, adventurous woman throughout her life.

8487883,3,B005WC9LBK,"3 not 5 stars because of the brazen omission or side swiping of Alcott's deep Christian beliefs, which undergirded her extraordinary dedication to her family (as in ""family values"") as well as her dedication to human rights, also inexplicably downplayed.  Also, the documentary essentially concludes, again inexplicably, that Alcott is overrated.  The intent appears to be to politicize and criticize this great Christian woman's seminal work from the prism of new world progressivism - gag.  It is otherwise informative and well done.  Tragic how she apparently shared the same affliction of another wildly prolific female writer of her time - Jane Austen, who also suffered from creative overload and ultimately, besetting autoimmune disorder which took her before her time, with myriad stories yet unwritten.  Austen and Alcott were towers of women, working in times modern authors can't comprehend, compared to the vapid ilk trendy society elevates these days.",1526169600,2,964,5.486486486486487
8487884,2,B005WC9LBK,I like poetry. I even like Emily Dickenson. Something about this movie just rubbed me the wrong way. The forced dialogue made this feel incredibly awkward. There wasn't a single moment I believed. Jennifer Ehle was amazing.,1522886400,,223,5.054054054054054

8487886,5,B005WC9LBK,"This documentary is a little dry in areas. However, I feel, each element is important to help build and fortify the significance of so many details of Little Women and her other published works. I feel it also helps the viewers  gain a deeper appreciation for the circumstances, events and people that were the biggest influences in her writing. It's inspirational because it humanizes her characters, including herself. Louisa May Alcott's life was depicted as something very tangible and identifiable to the viewers. It was Educational because it gives us an insightful perspective into the basic struggles for women during her life and our instinctive innate desire to survive no matter what we are face. We as women have come a long way, but we still have much more work ahead of us before we're truly equal. Thank goodness so women like Miss Alcott who help forged the trial, long ago.

Little Women has been one of my favorite, even as an adult, the ""Little Women Movie"" (1980's version), has been one of my entertainment viewing staples, ever since it first came out. The story, in and of itself, has so much depth and insight, it makes it difficult to absorb it all the first time.",1514505600,,1189,4.766990291262136
8487887,5,B005WC9LBK,"This documentary-style biography illuminates L.M. Alcott's life and times in her own words. Having visited Concord, Boston & Fruitlands in Harvard, MA many time, this film only enhanced understanding of the author's fierce independence and motivations. My appreciation of the author's passions and losses, years of deprivation, and fervor to provide for her family is deepened by this American Masters film.",1513555200,,407,5.688524590163935
8487888,5,B005WC9LBK,Stick with it past the first 15 minutes or so. The way that the actors address the camera in first person is a little odd at first. It all gets a lot more interesting once Louisa starts making some money and the family rises out of poverty. There was a lot of interesting information in this both about Louisa and the times in which she lived.,1513296000,,343,4.212121212121212
8487889,5,B005WC9LBK,"This is not a movie, but it is a wonderful story about a woman that the world does not know that much about. The show is about Louisa May Alcott from birth to death, her relationships with her family especially her father and her life up being a writer, things that were going on in history at the time, what she had to do to make money to support herself and her family and her life after her fame. Someone said that an artist had to suffer for his art and she definitely did, but from her life story and her experiences during the Civil War and afterwards, she had the tools to write her literature. I loved Elizabeth Marvel's portrayal of her. She did it with a sense of humor and realism that I loved and talking into the camera only made it feel that she was talking to the audience. I definitely recommend this to be watched for children to adults.",1512172800,2,854,4.245398773006135

8487891,5,B005WC9LBK,"This was such a well thought, honest and revealing biography of Louisa May Alcott. I believe she would give public television a well deserved nod for not making a fairytale of her life but in the words of herself and her family telling it as it was. Beautifully performed throughout, and highly recommended.",1511049600,,307,4.811320754716981
