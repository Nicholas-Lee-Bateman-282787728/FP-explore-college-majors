It had me laughing in the first minutes of the first episode! You will enjoy it & if you like Danna Garcia you will love it even more!",1380931200,2,297,4.0508474576271185
4134166,3,B003KWJWBS,"Un Gancho al corazn (A Hook to the Heart - 808 minutes)

This is a laugh-out-loud comedy at the beginning. ""La Monita"" (Little Monkey) is a boxer but she has hurt her wrist so she has to find another job.

Her boyfriend Roberto, who lives with his madre, is an unfaithful motormouth who smells very bad (he doesn't bathe). He wears goofy shirts and tells one of his amores to ""bite me on the O!"" (of the word ""Mexico"" on his t-shirt).

At one point, when leaving, he tells his sweetheart, ""Au Revoir."" To which she replies, ""Huh?"" He says, ""Ha! You don't even speak English!""

Our heroine's wealthy new boss, Mauricio, is engaged to blonde Constanza, who is bitchy, selfish, and mean. The cousin, Ximena is always boracho and itemizes her points, ""Uno, dos, tres"" while counting them off on her fingers.

Despite the delightful beginning and fun characters, this fizzles out toward the end, with the characters becoming caricatures. Sad.....",1372982400,2,941,4.783950617283951
4134167,5,B003KWJWBS,"Enjoyed it very much - sad, funny, villains.  Only complaint is that some parts did not appear to flow well because a few critical scenes seemed to have been left out.",1372636800,,167,4.387096774193548
4134168,5,B003KWJWBS,"I love this mexican soap opera, because it has elements of comic situations, dialogues are fluid, simple and fun, and yet, as in any soap opera, not missing a dose of drama, but very well balanced. Excellent performance of the leading couple: Sebastin Rulli and Danna Garca, as well as the hilarious character of Ral Araiza ""Beto"". Hopefully in the DVD, have included some deleted scenes or bloopers.",1372032000,2,400,4.897058823529412
4134169,5,B003KWJWBS,"Great story and actors.

It's got romance and heroes and villains but there were sooo many great surprises.  On top of that, I did not expect it to be funny but it was perfectly funny without being stupid.

Most of these actors have also been in other great Telenovelas.... so check them out!",1345680000,2,292,4.471698113207547
4134170,4,B003KWJWBS,"Faltan numerosas Escenas, como por ejemplo el disparo de Oscar a Valentina e Isabel, el Final de Oscar, todo lo relacionado con el secuestro y la supuesta muerte de Salvador, cuando Constanza cae presa, la muerte de Alicia y varias Escenas de Isabel, entre otras cosas, pero pese a eso Me Gusto Mucho el DVD.
El Resumen es Muy Dinamico, la Telenovela Es Muy Divertida y Mantiene la Esencia de la Historia. Con la ayuda de algunos dialogos se puede entender perfectamente lo que paso.
La Verdad La Recomiendo, Les Va a Encantar, No Se Van a Arrepentir, Diversin asegurada.",1339545600,,571,4.72
4134171,5,B003KWJWBS,"This is one of the funniest and most heart-warming telenovelas I've seen in a long time. You'll find yourself laughing and crying. The actors and characters are excellent, the story is gripping and addictive and the general effect is that of an instant pick-me-up. Five stars without any doubt!",1298332800,4,294,5.020408163265306
