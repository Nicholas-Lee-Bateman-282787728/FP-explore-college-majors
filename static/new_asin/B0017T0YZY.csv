3175408,4,B0017T0YZY,"Vito After cuts through all of the hot air and political posturing to give us an honest look at some of the real heroes of 9/11, as well as the price they paid. This is a beautiful, thoughtful, and moving portrait of a regular guy, a New York Police Detective, who just stepped forward and did the right thing. The film also shows how Vito, and the other brave men and women who answered the call of duty on 9/11, were not given the proper health protections and are now dealing with the consequences. An excellent movie that every American should see.",1225065600,,552,4.421568627450981
3175409,5,B0017T0YZY,I had the good fortune to see this movie at an early screening. The filmmaker Maria Pusateri has worked so hard to make her film one of the most moving and engaging portraits of a true 911 hero. Vito is a NYC Detective who sacrificed his health and well being to give some peace of mind to the family members of the people who lost their loved ones at Ground Zero. I have shown it in many film classes when I teach documentary filmmaking. My students are always engrossed and thank me for screening it for them. I hope everyone gets a chance to see Vito After.,1224979200,,560,4.242990654205608

3175411,4,B0017T0YZY,"This is a film that teaches us two things. One, the most obvious, is that 9/11 was en event of catastrophic proportions which shook our lives in an unprecedented way. The second, and most important one is that there are filmmakers who have the courage to expose problems created by the handling of the events by the authorities. Director Maria Pusateri has done that. She had the courage to speak through her film and show us how unfair society can be to its heroes. And how unfair and selfish we all are in forgetting the unforgettable. In my opinion 9/11 should be shown in all its aspects to these and future generations, forever. This film should be included in every curriculum.",1215302400,,683,4.652892561983471
3175412,4,B0017T0YZY,"At the end of Vito After you wish there were a Vito Before and a Vito Now prequel and sequel.  What is a hero but a generous human being that puts others before himself. Vito displays a refreshing perspective of a character that most of us envision and many of us wish we would have. Maria Pusateri captures in a quiet and no frills way the essence of leadership, the unwavering certainty of doing the right thing regardless of consequence may be, and the willingness and conviction to do it again even though you already know the negative consequences experienced. A refreshing and inspiring piece. It will linger in your heart even after you stop watching.",1214092800,,658,4.672413793103448

""A documentary bursting at the seams with the indomitable energy and life force that is Brooklyn homicide detective Vito Friscia. VITO AFTER is an intimate, surprisingly uplifting portrait of a first responder who, after helping thousands leave NYC on 9/11, spent months with 50,000 other police, firefighters, and volunteers sifting through toxic rubble for signs of those who had perished, in the hopes of bringing closure to the victim's families. Unwittingly breathing in an unprecedented mixture of carcinogens (asbestos, lead, mercury, chromium, PCBs, dioxins, to name a few), Vito, along with over 70% of those who helped, developed distressing respiratory and other symptoms. Not one to seek either acclaim or assistance, however, Vito drags his feet getting medical attention. By the time he does we realize we are as invested in his final diagnosis as if he were a family member - so endearing a character has he become throughout the course of the film. For while we recognize the telltale sadness in so many of his cop buddies eyes, it is Vito's humor and vibrancy we are drawn to, perhaps in our desire to rediscover it in ourselves."" -- Ruth Cowing, Director & Co-programmer, ROCHESTER HIGH FALLS INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL, 2008

8267152,5,B0017T0YZY,"VITO AFTER is an engaging and intimate look at the emotional and physical impact that 9/11 had on a true everyday hero. With a mix of interviews and verite, the film follows NYPD homicide detective Vito Friscia as he copes in the two years following his traumatic experiences of the World Trade Center attacks and months of daunting recovery work. We get a glimpse into his world, as he interacts with colleagues, family, and coaching his daughter's soccer team. As he deals with his own health issues, the reality of an emerging 9/11 health crisis sets in. This film should be seen by every American. Vito's story will move you to tears and laughter...it will touch your soul.",1403136000,,677,4.745762711864407
8267153,5,B0017T0YZY,"Vito After is a stunningly personal account of Vito as he tries to understand the physical and emotional impact of 9/11. This story does not end on the day of the tragedy but shows a NYC police officer living after and integrating the day in every day he lives. On many levels 9/11 becomes a part of his life. His physical, social and emotional challenges become apparent as do his courageous and positive solutions. This is the story of a tragedy and a personal triumph.",1250380800,,471,4.552941176470588
8267154,5,B0017T0YZY,"A very moving film.  I was wiping away tears.  Compelling scenes, well-edited.  Vito is a wonderful man, husband, father.  The film does such a good job of revealing Vito's personality along with what it means to be a policeman.  And to show what September 11 meant to those working on the site.  A very important film for alerting viewers to the 9/11 health crisis.",1227139200,,366,4.640625
8267155,5,B0017T0YZY,"This documentary was a wonderful look into how 9/11 affected one man who was there for so many others.  It is very intimate and personal, and not a story I had heard before.  Wonderfully done.",1225238400,,192,4.457142857142857
8267156,5,B0017T0YZY,"What an amazing documentary, tracking the health issues faced by so many of the ""first responders"" following the tragedies of Sept 11th.  The real tragedy is that now, 7 years later, we are losing more people because of these ongoing health problems.  These are also victims of 9-11, but no one is noticing and no one is reading out their names on the Sept 11th anniversary observations.
This film should be mandatory viewing for governmental agencies, and certainly, for our leaders.",1225152000,,484,4.962962962962963
8267157,5,B0017T0YZY,"Vito After is simultaneously funny, serious, compelling, touching and uplifting without being sappy.  I highly recommend Vito After.",1225065600,,132,6.333333333333333
8267158,5,B0017T0YZY,"""Vito After"" follows the life of one individual who put his own health at risk to try and save others.  It's an extremely well executed documentary that gives the viewer a personal insight into an under-publicized aspect of the aftermath of that day.  This story needs to be told and ""Vito After"" gets it just right.",1225065600,,316,4.625
8267159,4,B0017T0YZY,"For a long while, I would not watch films that dealt with 9/11, but after seeing Vito After, I came to understand how important it was for people to understand the after effects of a disaster.  This film really brings some quietly powerful ideas home to relate to - how a family feels pain for those that died but also must cope with the possible declining health of one of their own.  It reminds us that we all have the gift of a drive to both move on and to learn compassion.  It is also a testament to how one man can maintain his masculinity while trying to comprehend how he must respect his vulnerability.  I recommend this film every chance I get.",1225065600,,654,4.2926829268292686
8267160,5,B0017T0YZY,"Vito After is a very moving film about what actually took place during the 9/11 disaster.
I recommend it to anyone who is interested in what is being done to help those who risked their lives to help those in need.",1225065600,,214,4.2439024390243905
8267161,5,B0017T0YZY,"Vito After is a sensitive portrayal  of a New York City policeman who gave his energy and maybe his health to help others in the aftermath of 9/11. But more than that, it is about how his life was totally changed, in an event that changed the lives of all Americans. This beautifully developed documentary has us wondering why, after all the good work done by so many, more hasn't been done to bring them back to health when necessary and, to stretch a point, why is this country so negligent of its soldiers after they have fought for us? More importantly, what have we learned to protect those who fight for us so that they are protected before they go into battle? These and other questions arose in my mind after watching this thoughtful work.",1225065600,,747,4.492647058823529
