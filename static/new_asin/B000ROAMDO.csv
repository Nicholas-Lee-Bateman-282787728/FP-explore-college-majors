8201944,4,B000ROAMDO,Excellent movies believe they are hallmark ones. Both are great family movies but Carol Burnett only appears in one movie. Good clean family fun.,1470096000,,145,5.083333333333333
8201945,5,B000ROAMDO,Great movies. Arrived early and plays perfectly.,1406505600,,48,6.0
8201946,5,B000ROAMDO,"I saw this movie on TV years ago and was glad it was available on DVD.. Season of Hope has a lot of disappointments that almost breaks up this family, but they pull together and move on to the next stage of their life.. ~~  Haven't watched Seasons of the Heart yet; but I'm sure it is just as good..",1388361600,,299,3.9833333333333334

8201948,3,B000ROAMDO,"Carol Burnett is essentially the 5 top reasons I enjoyed the movie.  The plot was okay, but you sort of guessed early how all this would end.",1368662400,,141,4.222222222222222
8201949,5,B000ROAMDO,I purchased this DVD on the recommendation of another Amazon customer's review.  I was primarily interested in Seasons of the Heart with Caro Burnett since I am a long-time fan of hers.  This is the first time I saw her in a dramatic role.  Carol Burnett is so versatile and did a good job in this dramatic role.  I am sure she drew on personal experience for some of this movie.  Season of Hope is a pretty good movie.  I had not heard of it prior to purchasing this DVD but it is worthwhile watching.,1358380800,,502,4.231578947368421
8201950,2,B000ROAMDO,"This was a spur of the moment purchase while looking for something else.  I love happy endings, but I found these stories to be too predictable and lost interest pretty quickly.",1304035200,,177,4.709677419354839
8201951,3,B000ROAMDO,"IT WAS NOT THE MOVIE I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING, WHICH BY THE WAY HAS THE SAME TITLE (SEASONS OF THE HEART). SEASON OF HOPE WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE FOR THE FAMILY WITH THE EXCEPT OF THE ONE SCENE THAT IS TOTALLY INAPPROPIATE.",1245974400,,220,4.0227272727272725
8201952,1,B000ROAMDO,"I originally bought these b\c I thought that the one was a movie I'd already seen (Season of Hope). It was not. I'm not sure if it's a sequel (a bad one, cuz it doesn't fit w\the 1st) or what it was. The 2nd I thought'd be really good cuz it has Carol Burnett in it. It was full of cursing and had no interest in it. The tags I saw for these movies were 'family', 'clean', 'inspirational', 'Christian', etc. Neither were any of these titles that I could see.",1223942400,8,458,4.1
8201953,5,B000ROAMDO,"I bought this DVD for the Carol Burnett movie ""Seasons of the Heart.""  But we'll get to that in a minute.

The first movie on this DVD (which is one disc by the way and not two like it says in the specs above) is called ""A Season of Hope.""  JoBeth Williams and Ralph Waite lead the cast which also includes Erik Von Detten, Stephen Lang, and Jeremy London.  I had never seen this before, and I thought it was very good.  It was about a family who owns a lemon grove that is threatened by citrus canker.  That is only the least of their problems as that family is falling apart.  It was enjoyable, although predictable.  The performances were all great, especially that of the wonderful JoBeth Williams.

Now for the reason I bought this DVD -- ""Seasons of the Heart.""  I had seen this film when it originally aired, and I even taped it and have watched it several times over the years.  Carol Burnett's performance is pretty brilliant.  She gives a very subtle and touching performance.  She truly shines, and she looks beautiful!  The film also stars George Segal, Malcolm McDowell, and Eric Lloyd (from ""The Santa Clause"" films).  This film was as good and touching as I had remembered, and it made me wish that Carol Burnett worked more!  She really is wonderful in this film.

The sound and picture quality looked great to me -- I'm sure it's not up to some people's standards because these are TV movies from the 90's, but I thought they were fine.  I definitely would recommend this DVD to others -- especially to fans of Carol Burnett!",1204934400,13,1542,4.485611510791367
