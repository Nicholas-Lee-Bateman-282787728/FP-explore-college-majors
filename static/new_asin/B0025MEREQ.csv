3848802,5,B0025MEREQ,"I agree with everything Tami said in her great review, but wanted to add a few things I really like about this series.  First, for me, the best part of this show is the great relationship between Denny Crane and Alan Shore.  It captures for me what I value in my own favorite friendships, and constantly reminds me how much I value my own friends.  Boston Legal does a better job of illuminating this friendship dynamic than any show I can think of.  Second, as a kid who grew up watching the original Star Trek, I have generally been disappointed with most of what Shatner has done since....until this series came out!  This is the perfect role for Shatner, and as a life-long fan it is a real joy to see how well he does with this role.  To me this show is about friendship and the potential joy of everyday life, and for me Shatner and James Spader are the ideal actors for the roles, and both deserve the credit for making this show what it is.",1247356800,53,948,4.297752808988764
3848803,5,B0025MEREQ,Boston Legal has become one of my favorite TV series. I am very please with this 5 season set.,1245974400,,94,4.0
3848804,5,B0025MEREQ,"I'm a Trek lover so Cap. Kirk (William Shatner) was a childhood fav. I love him as Denny Crain in this TV series. A movement of new faces keeps each season as fresh and funny as the last. A ""Best Byu"" in DVD.",1244851200,3,208,3.86046511627907
3848805,5,B0025MEREQ,"I was so sad to see Boston Legal end its series.  However, I am very grateful to be able to own this whole set.  This is the only TV series that I own or desire to own.  The writing was well done.  The topics were thought provoking.  And it kept up with current events.  In some ways this reflects the history of issues in our country during the period in which it was filmed.  And what a better way to preserve history--through crazy, thought provoking humor.  My favorite show was the last episode but I can't think of an episode I didn't like.  For me, this series even made me sometimes view the world differently, even if i wasn't aware of it at the time.  Just a couple of days ago, I was in a store where a man had a ""tick"" and made some kind of funny noise.  I just turned to my friend and said, ""he squeeks"".  It seems like a simple thing, but before I would have been uncomfortable or even made a joke at the persons expense.  i guess some people might think that comment is a joke--but if they knew this series they would know it was much more of an acceptance and statement of fact.

One other thing that I love about this series is that it doesn't seem to matter which side of an issue you are on  or what your political affiliation is.  Or at least in my family.  I have a sister who is polar opposite of me when it comes to politics--but we both loved this show.  I think when a show can do that, it is magical because more people are able to listen to both sides of an issue when it is presented in a fun way.

If you loved this series, you will of course love this DVD set.  If you haven't seen this series, I would urge you to at least rent a few of the DVD's and then if you fall in love with it, buy them.",1242432000,95,1725,3.9883040935672516

3848809,1,B0025MEREQ,"If you're reading this, you already know how outstanding this show is. This is not a review of the show. This is a review of this product; this physical product. Which is deplorable, and awful, and cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. The plastic is thinner than 2-ply TP. The plastic dvd case is held together with unicorn tears and leprechaun spit. And since neither of those actually exist, well, you can see where this is going. It literally broke apart the very instant the case was opened.

The show itself? Priceless. Entertaining to no end. Spader & Shatner for 2020. But the only reason youd buy this is because the show isn't available to stream anywhere and its no longer 1998 and you're an adult and you now PAY for the media you chose to consume, and you're rewarded with the absolute worst quality in manufacturing available.

Disgraceful.

Plus its DVD quality. Theres so many pixels visible on my 4K TV its like watching a patchwork quilt flutter in the breeze on a clothes line.

But the shows still awesome.",1518998400,12,1019,4.644444444444445

3848832,5,B0025MEREQ,"this is the best legal show there ever was.  William Shatner and James Spader hit it out of the park every time and every supporting member of the cast including Shelley Berman - who died today - were great.  Every episode was enjoyable and while the firm had a higher success rate than most real law firms, David Kelley had a great time addressing issues ripped from the headlines.  Shatner was over the top (and would we want him any other way) and poignant as a once great attorney with ""mad cow"". And I found a new found respect for James Spader while watching this show",1504224000,,574,4.39622641509434

The whole cast is marvellous. Buy this do not hesitate it is truly a fun and different look at a Law Series. SPADER must be one of the most underrated American actors of his time. He is indeed very intelligent and funny. He can do it all. I am sure as a young man he may have been worried he due to his pretty boy looks maybe overlooked BUT he overcame that by putting in performances which showed how intelligent, how complex and how menacing he can be in his portrayals. The success of ""The Blacklist"" rests with him. The whole cast is wonderful also. The Female Lead is excellent also.",1484784000,,754,4.3546099290780145

So sorry to have discovered it so late, and  very happy we get to watch the series as often as we wish.  This one is worth watching 3-5 times.  I paraticularly liked the final season where they break the fourth wall (""You're an extra, you don't get to speak."") and clearly purposly ""jump the shark"" upon learning the series was canceled.  Candice Bergen is witty and also often plays the critical role of the straight man.

This is well-written, sharp-witted and spot on.  My profession kept me associated with lawyers a LOT and I can tell you that some of these people are just like real life - hilariously so.  The show treats of controversial subjects and does not flinch from portraying hypocrisy at its worst.  One of my favorites was an episode in which Alan Shore was forced to represent religious fanatics even though their views contrasted sharply with his.  After it was all over he got to zing them with a witticism that shut their nasty mouths.  A couple of times the legal team got to go before the U. S. Supreme Court and the comments about the judges on the highest court were really entertaining.  War and the military are not given a pass either.  Betty White guest stars several times and steals the shows.  I won't say what she does in order not to spoil any surprises but you WILL be surprised.  So many issues to critique!  I have watched this show all the way through at least three times while I exercise and it will be back in line to enjoy again when I finish a few other shows.",1475452800,,1231,4.3744493392070485

3848890,5,B0025MEREQ,"When it comes down to it, has there ever been a television series as witty, as thoughtful, as smart and as engaging as 'Boston Legal'?

Years ago, a very close friend with whom I work, would regale me with detailed descriptions of a show starring Bill Shatner. Weekly I would hear about the trials and exploits of Denny Crane and Alan Shore, but I never quite took the time to watch it. But then, on a fateful night staying at a relative's home in Huntington, Long Island with little to do, I happened upon an episode of 'Boston Legal' on TV.

Let me be clear, from that very moment in time, I was in. Game over. David Kelley's (at the time) latest creation had me in its clutches. It was witty, it was brilliant, it was sad, it was poignant and of course starring Shatner and Spader, it was quirky, yet perfect. The show - and its characters - came to mean so much to me that when going through a difficult time two years ago, I picked up the complete set (on DVD because it wasn't available on the iTunes store). Denny and Alan didn't fix my problems, but they gave me a hopeful respite when everything else around me seemed destined to disappoint.

Buy it. Watch it. Love it.

3848952,5,B0025MEREQ,"Boston Legal is one of those great shows whose streaming rights are in some terrifying limbo. I would binge this show regularly if all seasons were available on Netflix or Prime (I have both.) The fact I actually bought DVD's for it speaks to the fact it's worth owning, however; I had kind of hoped it was a box set, which it isn't. Just the individually boxed seasons. Better than nothing, and still well below what F.Y.E. or another retailer might sell them for. The fact I ordered this and got FREE SAME DAY SHIPPING is insane. If I didn't live in DC I'd think they were using drones already, which would be the exact kind of case Alan Shore would love to take on.",1437609600,,668,4.352

3848954,5,B0025MEREQ,"Boston Legal was a great series, even before Shatner joined the team. I wish that it could have gone on to more seasons. Did you enjoy ""The Practice""? If so, you must go ahead and get this entire series. My mother and I watched many of these episodes together, and discussed them afterward. I enjoyed the comedy elements, while she paid more attention to some of the drama. (I have a bit of Asperger's Disorder, so I paid attention to that character when he arrived.)

Thanks, guys, for finally letting us buy all five seasons at a great price.

I highly recommend all five seasons of Boston Legal to you.

We want the box set if it is available with James Spader . It appears there are two different DVD's with that title, or it isn't being made clear if they are one and same.
We know he is not in the beginning few, but we always like to start at the first season. Perhaps you can help us with that?",1436140800,,439,4.057471264367816

3849053,5,B0025MEREQ,"I have always loved William Shatner ever since Star Trek. His character is so different from his other roles, and he plays it very well. I love the very subtle Trek references throughout the show. James Spader and Shatner play so well together. Their character's relationship really makes the series special. Comical, loving and caring. There is a deep love between Crane and Shore. It is unique to other shows and in my opinion makes BL stand out among others. The quirky humor is infectious and addicting.  I am sorry the show ended as it was what I looked forward to most on tv. Now I own all the seasons and watch them over and over. This show will get you hooked. Give it a few episodes, and you will just want more.",1405900800,,721,4.421052631578948

I have no idea why they took it off the air, but now I can enjoy any time I so choose!  It's held up to time and it's still a whole lot better than what's on television now (I can't take any more reality TV).  FYI, James Spader is outstanding in his current role on ""The Blacklist."" I still get to see quite a few of their outstanding cast.  If you've never seen it, take a leap of faith ... you'll be very surprise by the talent (young and old).",1405814400,,540,3.9174311926605503

This exquisitely written series starring James Spader as the brilliant but naughty Alan Shore and William Shatner as Denny Crane one of the founders of the law firm of Crane, Poole, and Schmidt.  I don't know how David E. Kelley and the other writers slept while they were creating the situations that they put the characters in each week.  Their brains must have been firing non-stop!  My favorite part of each episode is when Alan Shore gives one of his summations.  He takes on the Establishment in whatever form it has taken that week and exposes the truth.  Despite his other issues, Alan Shore is a spokesman for the little guy.  Got to love that!",1404604800,,696,4.564516129032258

3849088,4,B0025MEREQ,"This is the part that William Shatner was born to play. He did great as Capt. Kirk, but when he stepped into this role of Denny Crane, he blew Capt. Kirk out of the sky. This is a great series and all involved are great actors and actresses. They picked a really good bunch of people and you can tell they liked each other. Great video transfer in wide screen. The final scene on the deck, smoking a cigar and talking between Shatner and Spader was always welcomed, 2 good friends that always found time to spend a few min. at the end of the day with each other. It's too bad it was cancelled and not picked up by some other station. A reunion show would be welcome. I would recommend this to anybody that likes drama and comedy in one show.  Well done cast and crew. Your time with us was to short.",1397433600,,799,4.15483870967742

My husband and I watch two or three episodes at a time.  Beside Mr. Spader and Mr. Shatner, who are both superb, Candace Bergen and Rene Auberjonois, add a richness to each episode in which they appear.

Some of the stories stretch credibility.  I doubt Mr. Spader's character could get away with some of his stunts in real life without some type of prosecution ensuing--but, suspending disbelief is all part of Boston Legal.  When something is this much fun, just hang on and go along for the wild ride.",1397260800,,767,4.62962962962963

A real lawyer who got hired by genius writer-producer Steve Bochco (Hill Street Blues, LA Law, NYPD Blue).  Boston Legal is IRREVELENCE to the maximum!  An 0ff-shoot of the more serious The Practice (which I never got into, too serious) James Spader (Stargate the movie and more recently NBCs BLACKLIST) teams up with William Shatner (I am NOT Captain Kirk, I am Denny Crane and you're not!). Candace Bergen (I am NOT Murphy Brown, I am Ms. Schmidt and don't call me Shirley), John (I wish I was a Loofa) Laroquette and incidental characters like,Betty (Serial Killer) White, Roma Mafia, Henry Gibson, my friend Frank (I know you think I'm a hack actor) Birney.  Dialog like:  (Opposing lawyer):  You did go to law school didn't you?  Spader replying): Actually I got my degree on the Internet.  Shatner (To Shirley's 17 year old grand-daughter):  You're as hot as grand ma (Shirley) are you as dirty?  Shirley's grand daughter (to Shirley): you were a suffragette, weren't you?  Shirley (To her grand daughter) How OLD do you think I am!?  Leave.  Through the windows, it's faster!  They take unwinnable cases before judges including the Supreme Court of the US.  They take ridiculous cases, like Denny Crane pulling an illegal concelled weapon and shooting a black man.  And him being defended using the Supreme Court ruling on the 2nd amendement.  This series is a send up of LAW, LAWYERS and TV SHOWS, NETWORKS and SCHEDULING (Schatner to Spader as Denny Crane to Alan Shore ""There must be some time slots we haven't used yet!""  If YOU truly believe that all the lawyers in the world should be sent into the OCEAN to drown then Denny Crane and Alan Shore must lead the pack and they RULE this show!  At the end of each show they sit on the balcony with Scotch whiskey and smelly cigars talking about Shirley Schmidt's Cheer Leader uniform from High School and all Denny can think about is Crane in POOLE with Schmidt!  This show is to TV what M*A*S*H was to Theatrical MOVIES.  This is Comedy/Drama of the ABSURD and David Kelley takes on EVERY taboo law case known to Man with Denny Crane and Alan Shore confronting the US Supreme Court without a CARE in the world!  When all is said and done Denny and Alan have but ONE thought and that is to see Shirley in all her spendor to which Candace Bergen (Shirley) can't stop laughing about!  The pervert lawyers at Crane, Poole and Schmidt aim to damp out racism, sexism, homophobia, government spying,false imprisonment, underage voting, under IQ death sentences and every other liberal cause you can think of from happening while they dwell on what it's like to lift Shirley's cheer leader skirt! You have to have a liberal sense of humor to like this show otherwise you'll take it too serioiusly.",1393891200,6,2852,4.717171717171717
3849105,5,B0025MEREQ,"After rewatching Boston Legal (thanks, Netflix) I realized it was so very good that I wanted to own it. The relationship between Alan and Denny is one of the best television has ever produced and is the center and heart of the show. And the very high quality of performance from Rene Aubujonois, Candice Bergen, John Larroquette as well as James Spader and William Shatner set a standard that probably will never be seen again.",1393891200,,427,4.706666666666667

It didn't show  up when it was scheduled to. I wrote to customer service twice to get it resolved.  They were helpful and gave a 10% discount for the trouble.  They also sent a second set which I did receive.",1391990400,,373,4.676923076923077

3849122,5,B0025MEREQ,"This was a great price when buying this set of all 5 seasons of Boston Legal. It wasn't until the last season they were on scheduled TV that I began to watch this show. Then later I found some of the earlier seasons with reruns on another network.

I wanted to see all the seasons shows in order so when this set was offered at the lower price I bought it. The extras showed some interesting things about the actors and how they enjoyed working on the show. Plus also showing some of the deleted scenes. Plus I am a Star Trek fan and loved hearing different lines said that made one think of lines from Star Trek. I also found it fun to hear the different actors make comments about things that made you know they knew they were just actors in a series. The only con I could find was only because I watched  episodes one after the other and at times it seemed Denny Crane was always making a fool of himself over a female. I think if a week had been in between the episodes that may not have seemed so bad.

All in all this was a fun series to watch and worth the price paid.",1391817600,,1075,4.085308056872038
3849123,5,B0025MEREQ,"We've been watching these DVD's in order for some time now. I'm going to miss them when we finish. William Shatner has really nailed the part of Denny Crane though I think Rene Auberjonois was better at his role of Odo in Star Trek Deep Space Nine. Candice Bergen seemed an odd choice to me but she does an excellent job in this show and I commend whoever thought of her. Well done! James Spader is quite different as Alan Shore from the role he played in Stargate but again he is excellent in this role.

Others have reviewed these disks adequately so let me just say that I may have learned more about the law from this show than from all the law books I've ever read. It has made me see the law not as some computer program with inflexible rules that can be applied to lead to an inevitable conclusion but as a living mechanism for resolving disputes with room for compassion and understanding. I don't always like, or agree with, the jury's decisions, but at least I have gotten a better understanding of the process and purpose of a trial and a jury.",1391817600,,1055,4.355329949238579
3849124,5,B0025MEREQ,"I usually find this kind of TV program to be mildly satisfying while always falling short of the West Wing, but I really have loved watching this series. There is comedy, drama and complexity. I can't stop watching it!",1391817600,,218,4.615384615384615

James Spader, Candice Bergen and a surprisingly good William Shatner and quite an array of top notch guest stars. Unfortunately the ham-fisted political speeches which are dropped willy nilly into the action with no regard for plot or pacing really start to grate after a while. I'm guessing even if you agree with the extreme left positions it is handled in such a sophomoric and obvious way that you'll check out after a season or two.",1382832000,5,519,4.842696629213483

It's so well acted with amazing reoccurring cameos like Betty White, the GREAT Shelly Berman, Michael J Fox (arguably the best work he has ever done) and Parker Posey. I really liked this show and thought they made appropriate fun of themselves and that set must have been a lot of fun to be on....

This show taught me so much ranging from love/friendship to some of the odd loopholes and dirty secrets of law and society. The characters especially Alan Shore (James Spader) and Denny Crane (William Shatner) in this show make the entire series worth watching.

Most people will probably remember William Shatner as ""the guy who played Captain Kirk,"" but I will remember as ""the guy who embodied Denny Crane.""

The show is excellently written and acted, you learn a lot that's still currently relevant, and you *feel* for the people you meet. It's hilarious and sexy and serious and you never, even at the end, think that they've gone too far or done too much.
William Shatner's and James Spader's characters have the best romance I've ever seen on television.
Also, there's William Shatner, which by all rights should be more than enough to convince you.

3849191,5,B0025MEREQ,"First of all, it's great to have the entire show in one box, because so much of the action
is based on the continuity of the relationships in the law firm. In particular, one should
follow the development of the friendship between the characters played by
James Spader and William Shatner, one of the unique ones in television history. But there
is a lot of action in the development of the lawyer with Asperger's Syndrome; he may drive
you crazy with his idiotic gestures and noises, but his journey is really quite touching.
Betty White's subplot--she's a serial murderess; and that's not a spoiler, because the show
is quite open about it from the start--is also interesting, though it's played for comedy.
There is a lot of sociopolitical material here, a lot of it extremely edgy. Most of it is
leftist-driven, but at one point a gay organization tries to stop two men from marrying
because their reasons ""aren't good enough""--a shocking reversal of what one might expect
on the subject of marriage equality. Still, the show is very briskly paced and the scripts
are extremely smart, because so many of the characters are top-notch lawyers who can win
even difficult cases. There's even a lovable touch of meta-TV, in that Spader and Shatner
occasionally make references to the fact that they're characters on a network series.",1367539200,18,1332,4.872246696035242

I remember those *dark days* before BL, when I mourned the loss of The Practice, especially James Spader's character.

3849217,5,B0025MEREQ,"There has never been, nor will there ever be, another television program like Boston Legal.  To say it was quirky is an understatement.

The series primarily takes place at Crane, Poole, and Schmidt, a huge law firm with the main players being William Shatner's egomanical Senior Partner Denny Crane with his ""Mad Cow"" disease, overactive libido, and gun fetish coupled with James Spader's ""skirt chasing"" attorney Alan Shore, then Candice Bergen adding the frosting on the cake as Shirley Schmidt, the one sane mind in the entire firm, who was once married to Shatner's character, who still fantasizes about her at every opportunity.

The story lines are so improbable as to make you scratch your head and wonder how the writers could even imagine them (think Betty White as a serial murderer who gets off three times?) and then suddenly Alan or Shirley will be in a court room with a closing argument that makes you stop and actually THINK about what may have been a relevant issue in our lives:  air or ground-water pollution by huge chemical companies for instance or tobacco companies being sued because someone died from lung cancer after smoking their cigarettes for 40 years.

The closing scenes in every episode with Denny and Alan out on the balcony smoking their cigars and drinking cognac while reflecting on their day in court (or life in general as they see it) are gems all by themselves.

Get the whole set -- I bet you won't be able to stop watching.  And, if you're like me, you'll wish it never ended.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boston-Legal-Seasons-1-5/dp/B0027CSMY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boston Legal: Seasons 1-5</a>",1348272000,3,1691,5.263940520446097

Heart wrenching moments {SPOILER ALERT} such as Deny realizing he is not so far from fatally succumbing to his disease and the emotions shared between Shatner and Spader's characters was so real, even a ""Man's man"" would feel his heart strings being stretched to the limit.

3849231,3,B0025MEREQ,"Living in Europe, I only get to sample US TV shows when I'm visiting there. I was impressed enough by Ally MacBeal and Picket Fences to buy the series and was on the whole not disappointed, particularly by the latter, of which I hope seasons beyond the first will someday come out on DVD. In particular I was moved to try more of David E. Kelley's work. Boston Legal has all the virtues of his other shows--notably the writing and acting--but after watching all five seasons I also found things to dislike.

The directing style, attributable I assume to Bill D'Elia, becomes annoying, with its fast pans, quick cuts, and the hands fetish.

The music is simply awful.

The treatment of the practise of law has so little to do with reality that I can only guess that Kelley's own experience with the law scarred him for life.

The two main characters are impossible to like. This is not the fault of the actors: Spader is simply excellent. And Kelley has managed to find a way to use Shatner, the least subtle actor ever, in a way that maximizes his strengths and minimizes his considerable weaknesses. But Crane and Shore are a pair of arrogant, unsympathetic sexists.

The supporting characters are poorly developed and, even more than in Ally MacBeal, chewed up and discarded before they have a chance to turn into human beings. Many of them are charicatures of the sort we have seen from Kelley before (omigod, not another cross-dresser). Those that do survive more than a season wear out their welcome: Christian Clemmenson as Jerry Espenson delivers a wonderful performance, and Jerry's partial overcoming of his disability is as close to personal growth as any character experiences, but I still was heartily tired of him well before the end.

Nor is there any development of the principals. Shore and Crane are pretty much the same jerks at the end of season five as they were at the start of season one.

What is it about Kelley and the male organ? I doubt that the word ""penis"" occurs as often in all the rest of prime time as it does on either Ally MacBeal or Boston Legal. Is it simply the Sopranos Syndrome (why do we use the F-word so much? Because we can)? Or is it something best left between Kelley and his analyst?

Somewhere about the middle of season four the dramatic side of the show turns into a soapbox. Previous reviews suggest that this bothered me more than it did others, especially those on the other side of Kelley's positions. Indeed I agreed with him more often than not, but I would like to see my opinions argued more forcefully and less superficially than is possible in a 30-second closing. Maybe this is just a symptom of the level to which political discourse has sunk in America.

This is not a recommendation for or against the series. Your response to it will depend on your own preferences, and if the preceding reviews are at all representative, there is a good chance you will enjoy Boston Legal. A good majority of the episodes are very good to excellent and well worth watching. But it is an idiosyncratic show and I don't doubt that reactions to the idiosyncrasies will vary.",1295395200,7,3120,4.62748643761302

In an age where broadcast companies continue to dumb down their programming, it is both refreshing that a show defied it, and sad that it was canceled with only 5 seasons when it had so much more potential.

3849236,4,B0025MEREQ,"I really enjoyed watching Boston Legal.  It's funny, it's outrageous, it's drama, it's everything you could want in a series.  You can laugh, cry and be mad all in the same episode!  You can't be too sensitive to some social issues while watching this show or else you'll miss the point of how funny it really is.  After all we have to be able to see issues from both points of view and be willing to listen to the other side even if you think they are wrong.  This show specializes in that.

I love William Shatner so of course Denny Crane is by far my most favorite character!  He is obnoxious and of course his Alzheimer disease is an excuse for him being so rude.  Crane's love of women is hilarious whereas James Spader's character (Alan Shore) love of women is just gross and over the top.

The only two downfalls of the show is Alan Shore's relentless pursuit of woman and that in every season they introduce new characters that you get attached to and then in the next season you never see or hear about them again.

Overall, this is a really good series that is sure to make you laugh and think at the same time.  I look forward to watching it again and again.",1286323200,3,1169,4.292237442922374

3849239,5,B0025MEREQ,The series is wickedly funny--from the first episode--and better with no commercials.  Buy the series if you like the show.  It's like having the four pound box of chocolates; you can't stop at one episode!  The ties tell a story as much as do the characters.,1277769600,24,259,4.586956521739131

Especially, Alan Shore's Closing Argument is amazing.

But as mentioned below, you should buy each series separately.
You can save some $25.",1270252800,,203,5.34375
3849243,5,B0025MEREQ,"This is an awesome series - I haven't watched all 5 seasons yet, but what I watched have been excellent.  The writing is supurb, whimsical and authentic.

3849244,5,B0025MEREQ,"David Kelly had written the Best TV show ever made. Boston Legal is well written, well acted. The series is worth your money, you will not be disappointed. The Only disappointment you will experience is: you can ONLY buy the seasons 1 through 5. Seasons 6, 7 8 are not made into DVD's yet. I hope they will get on that... I want to own the whole TV series. seasons 1 through 8.",1269302400,,377,4.178082191780822

The actors must have loved each script because they gave it everything.  I would not have believed if I had not seen it from beginning to end.  I laughed.  I cried.  I hit repeat so many times!

And I thought Boston was full of snobs.
How did it go over in Boston?",1269216000,2,510,6.013888888888889
3849246,5,B0025MEREQ,"I love Boston Legal for a few different reasons...  Not only are the characters blatantly human and erroneous, but the relationship between Denny and Alan fascinates me - the vulnerability of a couple of otherwise jerks, in many ways, is wonderful.  The other thing is that the scripts are never predictable.  They consistenly make me belly-laugh, which is why I wanted to own the set.  Tivo is nice, but I don't have it.

One more thought:  I hope that someone is as good to me as Alan is to Denny if I ever develop Mad Cow!",1266883200,,525,4.416666666666667
3849247,5,B0025MEREQ,"We loved the series and watched every episode
I would like to own it, but it really seems overpriced, imo.
Shouldn't be more than $70, imo so am thinking I'll wait.....
We really like Amazon for shopping online but I've found the exact same product priced elsewhere for $70 with free shipping

Usually Amazon comes around if something is overpriced, but I might have to shop elsewhere since my wife would be tickled with this series as a birthday gift.

Update:
At Xmas Amazon did drop the price down where I couldn't refuse and included free shipping. I also let every single person I know about the deal that wanted this. What I received was not all in one boxed set but each season in their separate boxes and I don't have a single about it. They're new, it's complete and they're MINE!

So kudos to Amazon for the opportunity to get it at a lower price.",1266537600,,857,4.445859872611465

It was so good in fact, I ordered Season 5 for my husbands Valentines gift.",1265587200,,347,4.898305084745763
3849249,5,B0025MEREQ,"Brilliant writing by David E. Kelley, et al., and perfect casting contribute to a winning TV series that is a joy to watch.  The serious topics are very timely and well researched, and these are offset by zany character antics which, as in Kelley's show, Ally McBeal, are often over the top.  The overt, sexually charged office sometimes bordering on harrassment, and inappropriate professional female dress (read short, tight skirts and cleavage) may offend some, but, if you overlook that aspect, there are few flaws in the show.",1265068800,,531,5.0227272727272725

3849252,5,B0025MEREQ,"This is a really well written show.  As they introduce new characters they come off as jerks, and then you warm up to them the longer they are on the show.  It is probably one of my favorite series that I have seen.  2nd only to 24 which is my new guage by which I rate shows.  The characters Denny Crane and Alan Shore are hillarious.  I had never watched the show and I bought the series because of the reviews.  I'm glad I did.  What great show.",1257465600,,448,4.0227272727272725

I just wait till September..(It's personal reason)and I overlooked or didn't find It's price rise high!

For us,this difference will be more bigger,cause we have to pay import tax things over 16600 yen.
