8733723,2,B015IKSP3K,I love Kathy Smith. She use to be clear and direct. Now she's trying to prove that she's not to old. The 10 minute blast was so much jumping I might as well put in her 80s high impact tape. Yuck. Plus she must have gotten dental implants because she whistles when she talks. Not hot. The weight lifting parts are okay.,1531267200,,318,4.145161290322581

8733727,5,B015IKSP3K,"This is a fabulous addition to Kathy Smith's 'body of work'. It features weights in just the right way, as well as smoking cardio that torches calories. There's no fuss, no muss, and no wasted time. As Kathy would say: 'Brilliant! I love it!'",1500076800,,242,4.5227272727272725

8733729,5,B015IKSP3K,"One of Kathy's best. 5 ten minute workouts. No matter what your fitness level, you'll get something out of this. Lots of compound moves to keep your heart rate up. She really manages to tackle every muscle in ten minutes in the Total Body Toner section - if you have 20 minutes to strength train add Body Basics to it, both use dumbbells. The Fat Burning section is basically a Tabata/HIIT section but better because no one body part gets overworked and there are ten different moves so the time flies by (unlike when you do 3-5 and then repeat them). I do the Fat Burning several times a week because it elevates heart rate without killing me or boring me. Great to do on a ""rest day""/day after strength training. Ab section is effective, well cued with a few moves new to me. Well-done and handy DVD.",1490745600,2,802,4.425675675675675

8733731,5,B015IKSP3K,"Kathy Smith is an inspiration to us all. At 65 even 20 year olds have trouble keeping up with her. I'm nearing 50 so I'm always looking for workouts that are not full of frantic activity. This FastFit series of workouts are perfect for me as I feel I can keep up with the energy for ten minutes. Sometimes I even do three workouts in a row for 30 minutes of exercise.

So what will you find on this DVD? I'll break it down into the segments:

Body Basics: This workout is only ten minutes but you will feel like you did 30 minutes. You will recognize moves like lunges and there is a plank challenge. I felt the burn almost immediately with this section. It is very effective. I walked for 30 minutes before doing this segment and it really worked to warm me up.

Total Body Tone: There is no need to warm up as there is a lot going on in this workout. There are a few balance challenges and I used 3 pound weights. What makes this so good is that you are doing two exercises at the same time. You will be doing upper body and lower body exercises at the same time. You will sweat and feel out of breath in just ten minutes.

Fat Burning Blast: This is the most active segment and I'd say it is very aerobic. This fun workout is high energy and you will get to show off your boxing moves. I felt the arm motions helped to move lymph around.

Miracle Abs: When was the last time an ab workout made you out of breath? This one will do that. It is very fast paced and challenging. A total core workout you will feel immediately afterwards.

Stretch & Flex: This final workout is supposed to be just stretching but some of it is more active stretching so you are not always moving slowly. I felt this was good for people who don't warm up first as it has activities that warm the muscles effectively. Most of the time you will probably do this after working out but it might be relaxing to do at night too. I liked the deep breathing and yoga inspired moves.

What I like most about all these exercises is there is a minimum of chit chat and you really get down to business and do great workouts each and every time you put this in the DVD player. No tedious instructions for newbies so this is mostly for intermediate exercisers. There is someone doing modifications the whole time so that is good when you first start. But soon you will want to do the moves Kathy is doing because they look so fun and challenging. The instruction is very precise and maximum exertion is done in minimum time.

This is one of my favorite Kathy Smith workout DVDs and I think you will agree it is very effective. Who can make excuses when the segments are only 10 minutes?

8733732,3,B015IKSP3K,"LOVE Kathy Smith.  She has been in the exercise business for a long time and knows her stuff.  You will feel your muscles after working out, so obviously the moves are effective.  I like that the routines are just 10 minutes - doable.  It would be great if the routines were programmable so that you could do multiple routines in a personalized order.  That being said, there is music playing during the routine with a good strong beat.  She doesn't stay with the beat because she speeds up for more intensity.  If you focus your attention to a mirror to monitor your own form you will miss her cues and the physical benefit of her speeding up for intensity.  If you focus your attention to the screen to match what she is doing you cannot concentrate fully on your own form.  Even the other exercisers in the studio with her struggle to follow her.  Admittedly, your form will improve after doing the routine again.  Account for that and you should be fine.",1458691200,13,958,4.511627906976744
