5402043,5,B00AA393KK,"While Amazon was not able to deliver this purchase overnight as promised, they were good enough to notify me that all of my shipping charges would be refunded (before I had to call and make my planned request for a partial refund).  The DVDs are priceless ... a refreshing compromise between my significant other's ""Spartacus"" series DVDs and my preferred rom-coms.",1427760000,2,365,4.983606557377049

5402045,3,B00AA393KK,"Repetitive, yet, for me, vastly entertaining. A look into the lives of ""the most researched mammal known to science"". If you like animals and/or stories about animals, you'll enjoy this collection.",1423785600,2,197,5.387096774193548
5402046,4,B00AA393KK,"I'm writing this on behalf of my 11 year old daughter, who bought this with her own birthday money through my Amazon account.  She says:

""It's like that kind of show that's adventurous and survivalish, and has some unexpected turns.  I still haven't watched all of it, but it's seriously good so far.""",1422316800,4,302,4.660377358490566
5402047,3,B00AA393KK,"We were disappointed with this series. The information is good, but the presentation is irritating and redundant. If they had taken time to edit out the repetitive introduction to each segment it would have been more enjoyable and we could have avoided endless fast forwarding. Would I recommend this series? Probably Not. Do I feel I got value for my money? Not really. That being said, the footage is excellent and it does nicely introduce the Kalahari setting and the life of Meerkats. I would have enjoyed this information better if it were in a documentary format. Too, it would have been more interesting if they had elaborated on the other creatures that play a role in Meerkat lives. Would I watch it more than once? Probably not.",1419206400,4,738,4.7734375

8548905,5,B00AA393KK,My daughter loves Meerkat Manor and has wanted this boxed set forever.  It's pretty much what it is.  Flower and her family and all their hijinks.,1502496000,,146,4.576923076923077

8548909,3,B00AA393KK,This came in a box too big for it and the dvds were loose rolling around getting scratched in the case by the holder.,1482624000,,117,3.9166666666666665
8548910,5,B00AA393KK,I have always loved the Meercats. They came in right on time. I am very pleased with them. Thank you,1471996800,,100,4.05
8548911,5,B00AA393KK,I loved the series of the Meerkat Manor.  I missed the last few episodes that was on the Animal Planet so I was very pleased that I was able to buy this set.,1444780800,,157,3.757575757575758
8548912,5,B00AA393KK,"Gosh, do I miss this show - and the era when the Animal Planet actually had  shows about animals.

When this show was on the air I was a guy in his mid to late 30s who watches sports obsessively. But whenever I noticed Meerkat Manor was on, I'd skip whatever sporting event I was watching to watch shows I've seen eight and nine times over. I remember the names of the meerkats during the series better than the names of other shows based on humans that we may have watched for 3-5 seasons.  Flower is the heart and soul of the first couple of seasons, and as the seasons go on it gets a bit darker and uncertain for our beloved meerkats, but with each season it's easy to stay glued on what is happening and hard to turn off.

I don't have kids, but if I did and I had an option of giving them Meerkat Manor or some obsessively crazy kids show with ridiculous music that is going to drive everyone else batty, I'd give them this show. I don't see how kids couldn't fall in love with the characters and learn a little bit about life, death and about nature itself. And in the process, adults can enjoy it as well.",1444780800,7,1113,4.162790697674419
