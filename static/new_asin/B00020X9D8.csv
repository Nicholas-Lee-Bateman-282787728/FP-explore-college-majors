8019722,5,B00020X9D8,"I have heard the story told a buncha times but none are acurate. Yugi is forced to duel Joey under Marik's control, while chained to an anchor. Whoever loses gets pulled to the bottom of the ocean with the anchor. With Tea, she was under Marik's control when Marik explained the rules, but was released before the duel started. She strapped herself to a chair and if anyone interferred a large metal crate would be dropped on her. Yugi switches places with the Pharaoh a quarter into the duel. The result was a tie so nobody was killed. Even though the timer on the anchor hit zero and both were dragged down. Joey had Yugi's key, and Serenity (after removing her bandages for the 1st time) dives down to free Joey. This is also a duel where Yugi's Slifer The Sky Dragon can't be used. The bonus episode features Bakura dueling Bonz from Duelist Kingdom. That is how Bakura won all 6 of his Locator Cards. I recomend this DVD to Yu-Gi-Oh fans who love the duels with a twist or when someone's life is on the line.",1244851200,,1013,4.3936170212765955

8019724,4,B00020X9D8,"I don't watch Yu-GI-Oh anymore, mostly because it dropped off into obscruity a couple months ago. Also mom doesn't really like it. However, this is a classic and by far one of the best. This is why Yu-GI-Oh became so popular.

  Seriously, I have no love for the game or the monsters they portray. It was really the awesome and diverse, and unpredicitable characters that made me love this.

  I doubt I'll ever get any of these DVDs, but if I do, this'll be the first one, no doubt about it.

MERIK RULES!!!!!! HE IS THE BEST VILLAIN EVER!!!!!!!!!!",1133913600,2,549,4.484848484848484
