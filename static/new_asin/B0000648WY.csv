Buyers do not need to be concern over purchasing this dvd, it will make you laugh and definately, you will play again. I use to watch Madeline myself as a child...long ago that is LOL but on a serious note this would be good for any little love one simple and not like some cartoons today. Theres still purity in some of these old nuggets.",1336780800,,476,4.3
