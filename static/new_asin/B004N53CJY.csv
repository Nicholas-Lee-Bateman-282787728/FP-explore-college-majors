4435411,4,B004N53CJY,"Barry Pepper and Kevin Spacey team up as a pair of high players in the world of the buying and selling of congressional backscratching and wannabe casino owners. If it were not for the want to venture out as private investors raking in stacks of green bundles in a Greek owned ocean faring casino, they might have expanded their schemes to more tribal casinos across the nation other than the 5 or 6 listed in the film. Spacey defines Abramhoff as a fast-talking, film quoting, pathological liar that ultimately and predictably had business connections and dealings with the seedy underworld. What seems to be a consistent historical end to many of the corrupt and fast money-making scams with a ""damn the torpedos"" mentality is that everyone surrounding Mr. Abramhoff, including his most loyal and faithful business partner Michael Scanlon (Pepper), runs to their own corner of safe haven while turning all evidence to the justice department. The congressmen he gave money to campaign for elections not only turned their backs on him, but prosecuted him in hearings by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. The Senate hearings was headed by John McCain, the very man he defeated in lobbying and activism for the election of former President Bush. Pepper does a convincing job as the hapless womanizer and partner Scanlon of Abramhoff's schemes, no matter how many times he is asked, ""how soon can you empty your desk"", but Spacey seems to have his Robin Williams moments of imitating movie lines of everyone from Walter Matthau to Al Pacino as Abramhoff was known to do, even to the point of his wife and his bosses no longer finding it amusing, but I did. What Jack Abramhoff did to the Indian tribes is no different than what the US Government and industries have been doing for centuries to natives.",1302048000,2,1802,4.872964169381108

'Casino Jack' chronicles the rise and fall of Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff starring Kevin Spacey. The film begins with his indictment, followed by a flashback to the beginning of his career as a high-powered lobbyist. The film does not get too deeply into Abramoff's activities in his younger days as head of the College Republican National committee and brief stint as a film producer. For information on his formative years, it is well advised to watch the excellent documentary about Abramoff entitled 'Casino Jack and the United States of Money'.

'Casino Jack' mainly focuses on the three major areas of Abramoff's lobbying history: work on behalf of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island (CNMI), for various Native American tribes to promote their casino gambling interests and purchase of SunCruz Casinos in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, initially owned by Konstantinos 'Gus' Boulos.

At the basic level, 'Casino Jack' provides an informative but somewhat superficial review of Abramoff's illicit activities (again, to be better informed, check out the documentary CJ and the US of Money). In the case of CNMI, sweatshop owners took advantage of the lax labor laws on the islands since the strict regulatory laws of the US did not apply. Abramoff got millions from these crooks to influence legislators to ensure that the sweatshop owners continued to exploit cheap labor imported from Asian countries. At one point, Abramoff is able to have Majority leader Tom Delay come out to the Marianas where he wines and dines him (including ubiquitous golf outings). Delay fails to make any deep inquiries regarding exploitation of the workers and is the later recipient of contributions to his campaign war chest and foundations from Abramoff. 'Casino Jack' further chronicles a setback that Abramoff must deal with--a new governor squashes Abramoff's contract so later CNMI senators are paid off and the senate council reinstates the contract. The US of Money documentary provides a sad postscript: international treaties eventually add regulatory clout to the garment industry so the sweatshop owners pick up and leave, resulting in the destruction of the islands' economy.

Abramoff's take no prisoners approach reaches its apotheosis in his dealings with the Native American tribes. Partnering with former Delay assistant, Mike Scanlon (played by an over the top Barry Pepper) Abramoff extracts millions from the Louisiana Coushatta tribe to ensure that the State of Texas passes a law preventing the Tiguas in El Paso from continuing to operate their casino there. He convinces the Coushatta tribe that his old college chum Ralph Reed, head of the Christian coalition, will work for the abolition of casino gambling in Texas. Since it would look bad that Reed was getting money from the Coushattas, their payments were funneled into a shell company under Scanlon's name. Money was sent to Reed and Scanlon but Abramoff of course got his cut, unbeknownst to the tribal leaders who agreed to the deal with Scanlon.. Then Abramoff goes back to the Tiguas and convinces them that although Reed worked against them in Texas, he actually was providing information about his anti-gambling strategy which would help Abramoff reverse the Texas ban on casino gambling. As it turned out, Abramoff's influence came to naught when Congress failed to overturn the Texas ban. The Tiguas were out millions and the embezzlement of their money figured in the eventual indictment of Abramoff.

Finally, in the most difficult to understand part of the movie, Abramoff enlists the aid of a disbarred attorney and Mattress company TV pitchman Adam Kidan, played by Jon Lovitz to purchase the SunCruz casino cruise boats. Lovitz plays Kidan as a comic sleaze-ball. The Abramoff documentary shows Kidan to be much more intelligent and classier than the way Lovitz depicts him here. The upshot of the SunCruz deal was that the owner Boulos was forced to sell his interest in his company since he was not a US Citizen. Abramoff conscripted a US representative Bob Ney (later convicted and jailed) to denounce Boulos in the Congressional record in exchange for access to Tom Delay. This apparently moved Boulos to act more quickly in agreeing to the sale of the company to Abramoff and Kidan. In order to obtain a $60 million loan, Abramoff and Kidan used a fake wire transfer of $23 million dollars and this was what they were eventually sent to prison for.

'Casino Jack' also delves into Abramoff's relationship with his wife, and some of his other interests including establishing of an Orthodox Jewish school for boys and two restaurants that he opened up for a time. Kevin Spacey is good at regurgitating all those movie lines Abramoff was famous for coupled with some notable impressions of famous politicians. But Spacey plays Abramoff more as a manic showman; the real Abramoff (in the documentary) appears to be much more low-key and cunning. Much more convincing is Spencer Garrett as Tom Delay who really gets the former representative down to a tee. Hannah Endicott-Douglass does a fine job as Abramoff's long-suffering wife. One of the best scenes is when she confronts her husband while he's taking a bath. Abramoff says he's ashamed of himself for letting 'God' down. The wife asks, ""what about your family?""

For those who know nothing about the history of Jack Abramoff, 'Casino Jack' should be viewed as a basic primer on the events surrounding Abramoff's rise and fall. The film's scenarists do a fairly adequate job in covering the bases but much of what happens is not always easy to follow. That's what happens when there is too much material available to condense. I would have preferred that the casting director chose someone else besides Kevin Spacey to play Abramoff. Nevertheless, his performance is passable enough to hold one's interest to the end. I'm not entirely sure that 'Casino Jack' works as a comedy (which is what was basically done here). Certainly, there were comic moments to the saga. Overall, however, this was more tragic than funny.",1293408000,8,6110,5.11011011011011

4435425,5,B004N53CJY,"I admit that I found out about the Casino Jack movie from a Washingtonian Magazine article that features recent 2015 coverage of Kevin Spacey. This movie dvd version of Casino Jack includes photos of  Kevin Spacey (as Jack Abramoff), Kelly Preston (Pam Abramoff), Jon Lovitz (Adam Kidan), and Barry Pepper (Michael Scanlon). The movie plot centers around what is listed to have been inspired by true life events as Jack Abramoff  and his associates (Kidan, Scanlon etc.) were creating deals as lobbyists. However, the beginning of the movie does foreshadow a little what may happen. For instance, there is a scene where Abramoff and Scanlon are frustrated at being turned for one of the casino deals. The frustration is not what opens the door to the scandal, it is what the men are talking about doing to Bernie Sprague (Graham Greene)one of the casino members who were not in favor of retaining their services (which makes the name calling allegations tame compared to just that one act of revenge). Then things get even more complicated when the character of Abramoff is shown being let go from his job at the firm Preston Gates and Ellis, His shock is understandable due to this happening at what looks to be a highly regarded restaurant that serves top notch sushi. His natural progression of then going to work for Greenberg Traurig was to be expected. However, the movie shows that what may have indirectly affected what later happened to him was his drive to open and maintain two successful restaurants and what he did to try to keep the money flowing. For instance, the movie showed that he took Adam Kidan on as a business partner. However, things start to unravel when questions arise as to certain money balances and Kidan hires one of his mob men to deal with and/or handle Konstantinos Gus Boulis (Daniel Kash). Despite his best intentions, Abramoffs daughter Sarah Abramoff (Hannah Endicott Douglas)gets a glimpse as to what may happen to her father in a scene where he is trying to pitch a script to what appears to be Hollywood area professionals who approve and spearhead certain scripts to made into movies. One of the bright spots to the film, Pam Abramoff is shown standing by her husband Jack Abramoff through both the good and adverse times, and I saw on an online aboutdotcom website that they are still married to this day. Some of the extra bonuses attributed to the Casino Jack dvd; Casino Jack; A Directors Photo Diary, Gag Reel, and Deleted Scenes. For instance, A Directors Photo Diary by the late George Hickenlooper features 85 different takes on what went into the creation of Casino Jack that are listed to have been compiled from May 23, 2009 to June 24, 2009 (these 85 takes featured the takes on how he felt in relation to the making of the movie when it came to collaborating with the various actors/actresses featured in Casino Jack). Additionally, screenwriter Norman Snider is among the various people discussed in this bonus feature. With these bonus features, there is so much detail just in the 85 feature take that could take up the length of at least two reviews.",1438214400,,3110,4.789571694599627

4435438,5,B004N53CJY,"Hello, America!  How would you like to watch a film,  ""based on"" real events in our nation's history, that will make you feel so glad that you are you?  Well, it's right here.  ""Casino Jack"" is THE story of Jack Abramoff, and I must admit that while these events were taking place I was so wrapped up in my own personal world I was only half aware of what this person had done, or why it was such a big deal, excuse the pun.  Anyway....I found out.  The production values on this movie are perfect,  100% consistent in tone, pacing, and style, and I'm not sure who the editor was but he or she knew his or her stuff; and of course the acting (and directing) was brilliant.
Now, to get back to my first statement, about being glad that you are you.  The beauty of this film is that even though we all know Abramoff did these things, the film plays out like a great story, with all the elements of fiction, and as the anti-hero I guess we'd call him gets deeper and deeper into this situation, I noticed that I was thinking about my own ordinary life with its twists and turns, and while I'd rather it be something different than what it is,  I realized that I'd rather be me with my not so famous life than him with his ""I can do pull this off and get away with it"" mentality.
So in keeping with as short and sweet as possible, if you are a fan of  ""based on real events"" films as I am, if you enjoy watching the inside details of how a public scandal unfolded, if you need to see how the other side lives in order to see that you have your own ""it's a wonderful life"" in many ways,  then watch this  film.",1408579200,,1605,4.092651757188499

Kevin Spacey is excellent as the lead character, a driven Washington lobbyist who sells access for money, and the other actors are uniformly good. We watch as Spacey sinks further and further into debt until he and his partner focus on Indian bands seeking to open casinos. The two men soak the bands for tens of millions of dollars in fees and don't always secure the results they are promising. The partners also become unwisely involved in a floating casino operation which ends up in murder. Some of the more outlandish scenes did actually happen - a representative from the Midwest really did stand up and make statements about the casino in return for campaign donations. The film is an instructive tale of what happens when morals fly out of the window, to be replaced by money. My only real problem is that some of the characters are little more than a grey blur and at the end you're looking a line-up thinking ""Now who is that again?""

Hollywood banter...here and there, I get it, it's no secret what the agenda is, but throughout a whole movie? It reminds me of children that don't know when to stop repeating a joke. Toward the end of the movie Kevin Spacey's character (Jack Abramoff) addresses a letter to Bill Clinton that essentially asks democrat leaders to help him smear Bush. Although that did not come as a surprise to me, it is a very clear example of the bias in Hollywood. Tinseltown is so comfortable in the modern day left-media, which unfortunately is how the majority of people get their ideas, that there is no shame in admitting that this is a smear movie.

This film follows the career of Jack Abramoff, key fundraiser for the GOP throughout the 1990's and early 2000's.  The movie examines his rise through the world of influence, finally landing him in jail.  Key to his story is the parallel themes of his amoral use of his skills to further the GOP, side-by-side with his personal faith to his Jewish heritage.  This does bring up one point the movie left out, but should have really included, and that is the many of the politicians he helped come to power catered to evangelical Americans that often looked down on Jews as the betrayers of Christ.  The film is well cast for all the roles except one, and that is Jack Abramoff himself.

I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be watching.  A ""dark"" comedy? A ""ha-ha"" comedy? An expose on political corruption?

When I think back on the script versus the acting, it reminds me of that old joke that goes ""the job sucks, but at least the hours are long!"" I am a Kevin Spacey fan, though he did this role no service.  Even worse was Barry Pepper (great as Roger Maris) who was either crying, whining or calling everyone ""dude"".  Kelly Preston (who I guess is looking for roles that don't require flashing skin) was so plastic that when she had her one emotional monolog toward the end of the film, made me believe that perhaps she stepped on a tack to work up the anger.  Not to forget John Lovitz (great monolog in ""A League of our Own"") who actually made me laugh when he was getting stabbed in the head and face with a pen!

Since the cast has some proven talent, I suppose that the script is the real culprit here.  It is too bad, because this could have been a really good movie if the script went in a different direction (a la ""Too Big To Fail"" - star studded cast, covering an important topic and had comic moments).

I can't speak to the facts, and to what extent the events portrayed are true vs. exaggerated (it is an unreal tale no matter which version you read), but as entertainment, it worked for me. It definitely is not done in a documentary style, as some films based on current events are. It is nutty, almost surreal - the writers have taken the more absurdist aspects of convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff's story and played off them to create a unique tone. I know many consider it a political satire, and I guess it is, but it is also a bit more absurdist than that at times. In that, it is PERFECT for Kevin Spacey, and I thought this was an Oscar-worthy performance. He looks like he is having A LOT of fun doing this, and that carries over to the viewer.

I also enjoyed the supporting cast - Kelly Preston as Abramoff's wife, Barry Pepper as his partner Michael Scanlon, and Spencer Garrett as congressman Tom DeLay. As I said, an unreal tale in any style, and the comedic tone in this one lets Kevin Spacey really bring that to the fore.",1311638400,2,1065,4.406091370558376

4435467,4,B004N53CJY,Spacey is great in his role as Abramoff and what makes him more interesting to watch is that  he is so convincing as a professional that he is the worst human being to be a super-lobbyist.  The film works like a credit card statement which it is because when it comes to making alot of money there will always be a turning point where it will all go to an end.

Big bad Republicans gone wild, trying to make money & screw people over hiding behind God & puppet dummy republican leader in Washington not smart enough to realize what's going on around him.  I can't wait for Hollywood to make a film about ""Slick Willy"" being entertained in his private rooms in the White House while letting America's foreign security slip which enabled terrorists to achieve their 9/11 plan.  If anyone really wants to understand how the world truly works may I suggest the movie ""Syriana"".  Warning if you do watch it : contains no leftist propaganda, you may have to decide for yourself about the message which is a foreign concept on the left.",1307232000,2,884,4.821192052980132
4435470,3,B004N53CJY,"There is a quote that states ""history is written by the winners"", attributed in this form to George Orwell. This saying seems to be true and in no greater respect than in the films that find their way to the screen and that always have. When Hollywood leaned right, patriotic films made the day. And now that it's more left, films condemning nearly everything are the rage. So it's not too surprising to find that the film CASINO JACK spends most of its time attempting to brand Republicans as the devil rather than focus on the main character of the title.

Lobbyist Jack Abramoff (Kevin Spacey) is the typical lobbyist as we've been told time and time again. The job of the lobbyist is to take information provided to them by their client and attempt to influence those in power, here Senators and Congressmen, to vote in favor of things their clients want. And when it comes to making mountains move, Abramoff is a lobbyist you want on your side.

As the film begins, Abramoff is attempting to gather higher profile clients for the firm he works for. First connecting with an manufacturer in the foreign Northern Mariana that uses questionable labor tactics and then bringing in a tribe of Indians who are looking to protect their gambling business. Both of these set Abramoff up in the big leagues. But then a senior member of the firm wants him to help find a buyer for a possibly corrupt gambling cruise ship line and things begin to go south.

Rather than find someone else, Jack and his partner in crime Mike Scanlon (Barry Pepper) decide to find a front man and take over the business themselves. Their choice is not the best one but it is someone Jack thinks he knows and thinks he can control: Adam Kidan (Jon Lovitz). Kidan was once the owner of a successful mattress company but has fallen on hard times himself. Now he seems the perfect fit for Abramoff.

Things start out fine but slowly go from bad to worse. The clothing manufacturer is taken to task for labor law violations, the deal for the cruise line is up in the air thanks to some financial shenanigans Abramoff and crew attempt and the Indian tribes begin to notice something just isn't quite right in their accounting departments. Through is all Jack continues to wheel and deal with Republican members in Washington as he tries to bring it all in check.

This sounds like a great story and in actuality it is. Or at least it could have been. There is a section of the film where the Abramoff begins to question just where it was he went wrong, just where it was that he lost sight of doing the right thing in helping others and instead just wanted to make money. No, making money is not a bad thing but doing so using illegal means and trying to hide it is.

The problem here is that the section just mentioned last perhaps 5 minutes tops. The rest of the film is busy trying to paint a portrait of Republicans as the most corrupt group of politicians to walk the face of the Earth. This is not to say they can't be but the fact of the matter is that corruption doesn't have an R or a D behind its name. Both sides have had their fair share of corrupt individuals. To make an attempt to claim only one just cheapens the true story here. And to think that there wasn't an unrepentant bone in Abramoff's body seems disingenuous at best. Perhaps he doesn't have any regrets but had that been the story or even going back and forth attempting to show he had none would have made a better film. Instead we have the stereotypical politicians that in Hollywood are ALL guilty of being corrupt...but only if they're Republicans.

Kevin Spacey is always great to see and here he turns in another fine performance. The only thing annoying (and perhaps this was true) was in his portrayal of Abramoff as always doing impersonations. Sure Spacey does a great job of that, but it wears thin fast. Still, Spacey can make a believable character out of little and does so here. We don't get to see much depth to Abramoff, but when those moment shine through, Spacey does a great job.

Abramoff's fall from grace, a top paid lobbyist to jail inmate, is an interesting story. Even the bits and pieces offered here make for a tale that makes you want to look deeper into the real events. But as told here it feels slow, using frantic movements and speeches that at the same time make you check your watch to see how much longer the film runs. Perhaps one day Hollywood will learn that a great picture would take news events and present both sides of the story, perspective that tells you what went on from every angle. Until that day arrives my guess is they'll make more movies like this, ones that people on one side or another will hail while those on the other side find fault in.",1306713600,2,4742,4.473988439306359
4435471,2,B004N53CJY,"Kevin Spacey gives a virtuoso performance in director George Hickenlooper's freewheeling look at flamboyant D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff.

So what's the lesson from this tale?  Don't tell your gold-digger girlfriend your dirty dealings? That's what I got.  I know it's a comedy but there's really nothing funny about the story despite the fact that all the characters are portrayed by comedians.  Great movie though.  It's funny that the law firm (traurig) faced no apparent sanctions for his actions which they implicitly rubber stamped.

a fan of Kevin Spacey and most of his movies are interesting
and funny, this one is no different.

From the beginning of the movie we get a feel for the
character and the view point of Washington lobyists.  They do
have more power than we would like, and at times it gets
out of control and leads to excesses.

Perhaps the point of this movie is this: if you are going to
cheat, don't be greedy and overdo it for God's sake.  It will
bite you back.  :)

4435476,4,B004N53CJY,"There are any number of movies that are ""based on true events"" and the producers often run fast and loose with the facts. Here you have a movie that starts by saying ""inspired by true events"" so you know your in murky waters. I don't know the facts of the original story and don't know how they were tweeked to make the script work, so I had to take the movie at face value. That being said, this was still a great watch.

I won't recount the story as others already have, but watching Kevin Spacey playing Jack Abramoff is something to behold. He turns him into a very colorful character. I had to keep reminding myself that he was ripping people off, had an ego the size of a small country and that his likability was probably the very thing that allowed him to succeed at being a real scumbag. Barry Pepper, who plays his sidekick Scanlon, is essentially as bad as Abramoff, and Pepper plays him with comic aplomb. He is way over the top with his ego and need to consume. Most of the other secondary characters are written and played well.

This is a well paced, well directed movie. At just over 2 hours, I wasn't at all bored. The story unfolds at a very rhythmic pace and there is no down time filler. All the other production values are pro level as well. If I have any complaint it would have to be that too much of it was played comically. As I mentioned, Pepper's Scanlon particularly went a bit too far for me. There is a scene where he is coming apart because some things he told his girlfriend about his dealings are now coming back to bite him in the butt and he's looking at some serious jail time. Most movies would have played this heavy and had the audience chewing their knuckles with the tension. Here, I nearly had to keep myself from laughing. But that's a minor quibble given everything else that happens here.

This movie occupies the same space as ""All the President's Men"" and ""Recount"" among others. Though maybe not quite as good as those two it's still a heck of a ride in it's own right, even if it was only ""inspired by true events.""",1304640000,,2064,4.328165374677003

Reading newspapers or watching TV News (infrequently) I tell myself  that media liberals can't possibly be as ignorant as they appear about basic aspects of American life - politics, economics, business, social policy.  Then they make a movie like Casino Jack, a crass vehicle for the mainstream liberal world view, shouted unapologetically and fervently. The result is truly scary.  I'm not referring to the caricatured conservatives we're supposed to fear -- racist, homophobic, drunk, insensitive, greedy, hypocritical, stupid (Ronald Reagan, as ""everyone"" knows),and corrupt-- mind you, but rather the ignorance/arrogance one-two on which this flimsy script is built.
Lobbyists are pushy and aggressive? Oh my! Some (or many) are corrupt? Heavens! All Republicans dream of turning a family out into the cold in the middle of the night?  Of course!

4435481,3,B004N53CJY,"A Jack Abramoff film had the real potential to become an A film. Something happened on the way to the theatre. The story is one that needs to be told, good actors, but it is a film that is too outlandish and too over the top. This is probably the real Abramoff. The man who gives lobbyists a really bad name. He put Tom DeLay into the eyesight of the real world, and DeLay was found guilty at his trial. The dirty tricks and murder and mayhem attributed to Jack Abramoff and his ilk is so messy and so ugly that comparing it to the Watergate may seem second rate.  All of the power in DC it seems, was beholden to Jack Abramoff. Money was given and spent freely to win elections. Abramoff says plainly that without the money he spent in Florida on Bush's behalf, Bush would not have won the Presidency. I agree with him that our country may have been a better place.

What seems to me to be the best of the film, is a scene in a Senate hearing with John McCain presiding. Some of the Senators present were given money by Abramoff and yet, here they were berating him for his practices. The real hearing with McCain present is interspersed with actors. It is quite extraordinary. Real names are used, and the actors portraying them are very much like them. This part of politics that we seem to see more of on a daily basis is abhorrent to most of us. To the politicians who inhabit DC, it is business as usual.

Jack's family stood by him. He is portrayed as a man with an ego bigger than he is. A little off center and downright crazy at times. Someone who spent money literally like water.  He bought and sold and then bought and sold some more. Little thought to anyone but to his need to be the biggest man. Well, he failed.

After finding a contribution loophole, Abramoff and Scanlon begin to exploit this and become very, very rich.  I enjoyed this movie.  I like true story movies, and I really enjoy political ones too.  There was a lot of stuff in here I didn't know about.  The amount he took and the favors he gave out are astounding.  This movie really exposes the lengths that he and other senators will go to in order to get what they want.  The movie is filled with different movie quotes from the ""Godfather"", ""Rocky"" and others, which is fun (Spacy is a pretty good impressionist).  Overall I really liked this movie, and found myself liking Abramoff even less then before.  The amount of money he through around to get his way is enough to make you sick, especially when you think a lot of our tax money went to helping him by a casino boat.  Abramoff gets an F, as for the movie, I give it a B+.
