And she certainly delivered with an excellent performance as well as the entire cast. Really nice sequel to And Baby Makes Six!",1493683200,,297,4.730769230769231

8183729,3,B000O785YC,"This CBS made-for-TV film is a sequel to And Baby Makes Six, a well-received NBC flick from the previous year.  Core cast Colleen Dewhurst and Warren Oates return, as well as Mildred Dunnock.  The three actors playing their children are different, which is annoying if you saw the first film.  This one can stand alone, though.

Michael and Anna Kramer (Oates and Dewhurst) are a middle-aged couple who have just added an unplanned 4th child to their family.  This affects the lives of the family members in different ways.  Anna is consumed by taking care of the new baby and breastfeeding her, and is reluctant to accept much help.  As the euphoria wears off and reality sets in, she begins to fret about aging and about her body.  It starts to take over her life and adversely impacts her relationships with her husband and other children.

Michael is more laid-back about the changes in their life, but begins to resent his wife pushing him away.  Their younger son is struggling with some issues of his own, which go largely unnoticed in the chaos, until a crisis arises.  Anna's mother (Dunnock), older daughter and older son reach out to try to help her.  However, it takes nearly losing what is most precious to her to give her the perspective to move forward.",1219795200,,1268,4.6877828054298645
