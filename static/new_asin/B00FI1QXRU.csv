5993164,5,B00FI1QXRU,"My 3 year old son loves Octonauts! It's very entertaining and educational show. It will teach your child about different sea creatures you didn't even know exist.

Please notice that Amazon has the same product with the puzzle ""Meet the octonauts w/puzzle"" and currently the price is same than this product without the puzzle.

This DVD includes 3 great octonauts episodes
1. Humuhumunukuapua'a
2. Narwhal
3. Undersea Storm

At the end of each episode is a creature report in the same way than in the TV shows. This is nice because in some DVD's 'creature reports' have been separated and don't play in the end of each episode.

As Peso would say it, Flappity flippers !",1425254400,2,670,4.75

5993173,5,B00FI1QXRU,"Octonauts is one of my son's favorite shows. I love the ""creature reports"" that engage him and make it fun for him to learn about the animals that the Octonauts encounter in their adventures.
Sad that Disney doesn't do more with the Octonauts with merchandising in their stores and parks, I'd love to see this show rank right up there along with Jake and Sophia.",1415836800,3,362,4.584615384615384

5993177,3,B00FI1QXRU,"We love the octonauts - nay, some might say we are obsessed - but this DVD has little value.  A mere 3 episodes on a DVD, as opposed to the 6 on the other DVDs?  It seems like a waste of time to even put it in the player and fiddle with the controls and remind myself how to get it all set up every time...  Even though we have the DVD, we now stick to online viewing, where over a hundred episodes from BBC/Disney can be easily found.  I would love to buy a more substantial collection, and would do it in a heartbeat if it was offered.  Until they release something longer, I advise against purchasing this one in particular - buy one of the other collections, at least, for your own sanity.",1405036800,13,693,4.103703703703704
5993178,1,B00FI1QXRU,this is not appropriate for children i let my grandson watch this one and all the animals do in the movie is curse,1404604800,,114,4.0
5993179,5,B00FI1QXRU,"My 2 year daughter loves the Octonauts.  It's a colorful, fun, and positive show that teaches about marine life.  It also has a very catchy song, called The Creature Report, at the end of each episode where they summarize everything they just learned.

This DVD has three episodes: Narwhal, Undersea Storm, and Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.  This is less than other Octonauts DVD's, which have 6 episodes, and are distributed by the same company.  I paid less for this DVD than the others so I'm not complaining.  The episodes can be played back to back or individually and the image quality is great.

We decided to get rid of cable so this DVD and a few others have helped make sure my daughter can still watch her favorite show every now and then.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.",1400803200,,782,4.698529411764706

5993182,5,B00FI1QXRU,"My three boys (4 and under) adore the Octonauts (especially the Creature Reports, which automatically play at the end of each episode on this DVD).  I like that they educate about actual lesser known sea creatures, instilling an early interest in Biology and Zoology.  Wish this DVD had more than 3 episodes!",1399680000,2,308,4.903846153846154

Run time on the disk is 40 minutes. Contains three episodes:

Narwhal
Undersea Storm
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (it's a fish that lives near Hawaii)

At the end of each episode is a creature report. It is a song-and-dance number with a little information about the animal from the episode and includes actual pictures.
