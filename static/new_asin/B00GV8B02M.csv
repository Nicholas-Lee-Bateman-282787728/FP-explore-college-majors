A small English village in 1348, at the beginning of the Hundred Years' War. Lady Matilda Mellerby's husband is taken prisoner by the French, but her nephew comes home with an important French prisoner who Matilda tries to exchange for her husband through the local bishop. The bishop, however, is a greedy perverted charlatan who wants favors from Matilda, and the Frenchman turns out to be someone more than they bargained for. Meanwhile, the Black Death begins breaking out. . .

This British Indie really tries: The props and costume design are pretty realistic, and there is a fairly solid storyline. Though it's not exactly Middle English, the script is also decent. BLACK PLAGUE is nowhere near as cheesy as its cover suggests. The problem is that it's laughable as an historical drama because the characters are mostly fictitious, the plot is entirely so, and the supernatural horror elements kill any attempt at realism. On the other hand, most modern horror fans are likely to find it quite dull. There is some violence, gore, (male) nudity, and ucky plague stuff; however, most of BLACK PLAGUE consists of bickerings and finaglings between Matilda, the bishop, the mysterious Frenchman, and various others. The true extent of the plague is not actually shown here, nor is the war in France. Finally, this film just isn't particularly scary.

6119116,2,B00GV8B02M,"I can usually tell within the first 20 minutes if I will like a film. I could not generate any interest in this one and turned it off. I guess I was looking for a ""Game of Thrones"" like performance but didn't see it. It appeared as if the producers were betting on the promise of T&A rather than acting because in the first 15 minutes we had a young girl giving a knight a bath and the bishop showing Headey his porn collection and telling her she would have to replicate each act if she couldn't come up with the taxes she owed. Plot and acting took second place so I didn't waste my time.

To top off the review, I discovered while researching the movie that it was really made back in 2002 and probably was released now due to Headey's success in ""Thrones"". Classic rip off!",1394496000,7,777,4.214765100671141
6119117,5,B00GV8B02M,"I like this genre of movies, set in the middle ages.  It is a serious movie, there is no comedy in it, but it does have sex and violence.  It is well written (mostly), and the acting is very good.  Lena Headey is lovely to watch as always.  The sets and costumes appear authentic and the medical facts seem well-researched.  It shows the buboes (enlarged lymph nodes) that were typical of the bubonic plague.  Of course they take some liberties (I don't think they used the f-word back in 1349).  Overall I really enjoyed the movie.",1394323200,3,532,4.479166666666667

6119119,4,B00GV8B02M,"lena headey from game of thrones starred in this, which is funny because if you goto imdb its not even listed, but non the less she's the main actress, its a descent flick set in the middle ages where a war between an English lord and a French one is going on, a prisoner is taken from each side, I don't want to give spoilers so I will just say a version of the black plague is going on and a curse is involved, its really an ok movie. sorry I give terrible reviews I just figured people needed to know someone took the time to watch this movie and found it a descent flick",1393459200,5,574,4.0
6119120,1,B00GV8B02M,"Saw this at redbox, I like Lena Headey, and thought this might make an interesting Middle Ages mystery, i.e., 'Name of the Rose'.  Wrong.  As much as I like Headey's acting, this is an awful film from 2002, originally named Anazapta.

Depressing, dull, and dumb dialogue.  They present the expected mud, mire, corruption of the Dark ages, but offer a kooky story filled with flashbacks, some kinky drawings, pox marked bodies and poor filming.

Ms Headey plays a noble woman whose ailing husband goes missing.  The English are at war with the French, and she attempts to get back her husband by using a mysterious stranger, keep some sanity in a messed up infected world, try not to get taken by a corrupt, perverted Bishop, and deal with supernatural going ons.  My summary sounds better than it is.

Not good.  R rated mostly for violence and general tomfoolery nonsense.  ""I wanted my husband and you brought me a monkey.""  I wanted a better movie.",1393027200,6,951,4.737804878048781
6119121,2,B00GV8B02M,"In 1349 Walter (Jon Finch) is fighting those pesky French. His manor is in the hands of his wife Lady Miltilda (Lena Headey). Walter gets captured and is ransomed. Nicholaus (Jason Flemyng) his nephew has also taken a hostage, the son of the Count,  Jacques de Saint Amant (David La Haye) oddly the only man with any class in this British film.

There is an air of mystery around this man who appears to be something other than we think. He has a scar of a cross on his chest. There are also uneven flash back scenes that are basically meaningless until an hour and twenty-two minutes into the film when we find out about Walter's first wife (Elizabeth Marmur) a story every villager knows about...except his current wife Matilda,

The story is slow to develop and once it was developed it moves slow to the climax, at which point I realized the film wasn't worth watching. Poorly conceived and executed.

""Black Plague"" is the latest Redbox recycled horror film offering. It was a 2002 film called ""Anazapata"" a word that is explained at an hour or so into the film and then becomes meaningless. ""Black Death"" was a far better film. Most films about the Black Plague are better (even that zombie one). In fact most films that have the word ""Black"" or ""Plague"" in their title are better.

2 STARS is generous.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, rape, male nudity, graphic sexual drawings...and all done rather poorly.",1392940800,9,1412,4.673387096774194

8627770,1,B00GV8B02M,Bought to show while teaching about the plague.  Orgy scenes and very sexual.  Completely inappropriate for educational purposes.  Wish I could return instant video!,1411603200,2,165,5.791666666666667
8627771,1,B00GV8B02M,"Get past the first half hour.  I dare you.  I double dare you to get past 45 minutes.  If you can, you should try out for any Special Forces team and go fight terrorists, because YOU, fine viewer, are superhuman.

The settings were accurate, I thought.  Other than that, the rest of this movie is boredom on a stick.  Two or three great actors, a lame plot, and pacing that would make Evolution say, ""Hey!  What's the hold up?""

Speaking of evolution, there is a monkey in the movie.  If that helps.  I hope he was paid well, because the guys at the zoo are gonna rip him a new one for this movie.

AVOID.  If you want a great medieval action movie, check out these films:

1) Ironclad (the first one, not the terrible second film released recently)
2) Black Death (with Sean Bean)
3) Season of the Witch
4) The Thirteenth Warrior
5) Kingdom of Heaven
6) Robin Hood (with Russell Crowe)",1409443200,4,886,4.329268292682927
8627772,3,B00GV8B02M,"War, poverty, unexpressed desire and Christianity are strange bedfellows, and also commonplace...so it seems to have been during the times of the plague. This film is supported by a very respectable cast, Director of Photography and set and costume designers. There are moments that I feel confident to bring my imagination to this time space, set at the beginning of a pestilence that killed so many people. The twist here, is that nearly everyone in this small town holds a dark secret (man's inhumanity to man sort of stuff, well, really man's inhumanity to woman), and when a stranger comes to town, we are slowly led to see that there will be a reckoning. Shot like a Medieval episode of 'X Files',  Black Plague draws a connection between sin and this historic pandemic disease. What worked was the build up of tension as the 'revelation' became known to certain individuals of the clan. Also, I am thankful that the film's premise was delivered with a healthy amount of mystery (or nebulous reveal). What worked less well, was the way in which the film as shot and edited; more footage reads like action adventure, when perhaps we might have taken in the themes of this film had we been given a bit more imagery from the point of view of its characters. That said, it is a good mid-week entertainment.

*Note. I am happy to see Lena Headey in the lead role, and look forward to more vehicles from which she will expand herself and take the lead in telling stories from a woman's stance.",1400716800,6,1493,4.651515151515151

8627775,4,B00GV8B02M,"This movie is an excellent figment of someone's imagination.  I gather they were raised Catholic and now, think of themselves as ""Recovering Catholics"" like most of the religious students from the 70's-90's do.
I enjoyed the film, the actors and the settings.
The plot was very religious to me, when the plague was everything but.
Yet, the storyline worked.
