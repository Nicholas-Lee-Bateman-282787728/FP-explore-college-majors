""Word had spread among the lacrosse families that 60 Minutes would blow what was left of Nifong out of the water and, they hoped, bring the case to an early end.  That scenario overestimated Durham's voters and North Carolina's governor, attorney general, and newspapers.  But when the special, thirty-five-minute segment--twice the length of most 60 Minutes segments -- finally aired on October 15, after several delays, it hit Nifong hard and for the first time showed the most dramatic evidence of innocence to a national audience.

""Among the highlights of the program -- Ed Bradley's last before his death of leukemia -- were interviews with the three defendants, who convincingly denounced the charges as lies and came across as appealing young men, and Kim Roberts.""
