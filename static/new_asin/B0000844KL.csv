7978929,4,B0000844KL,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It didn't get much advertising or marketing, but I found the story and the acting quite good.  Obviously, David Hasselhoff plays the lead role.  Veteran actor, Rod Stiger plays the villain or antagonist.  It's a Hollywood produced movie but shot entirely in the Philippines, in and around Manila, Angeles City.  Don't worry, the lovely and sweet Donita Rose has a great supporting role.  I thought that the Hoff's character and Ms. Rose's played well together and formed a nice, respectful bond.  It's not like that.  In fact, this action packed drama, has no romantic interludes whatsoever.  It's all business, just shady!  Even though the story is fiction, they do interlace it with some facts and historical references, i.e.: the eruption and economic impact of Mt. Pinatubo, President Marco's reign & Martial Law.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I'm no Hasselhoff fanatic, but he really did the character well.  It was very serious and earnest--not goofball or sarcastic.  I'm glad I bought the DVD and encourage you to also.",1334016000,,1062,5.063583815028902
7978930,5,B0000844KL,"This movie should have made Hasselhoff a $20 million dollar movie star.  Oh sure, he always delivered the goods in Baywatch and movies like ""Nick Fury"" and ""Jekyll and Hyde: The Musical"", but this is a drama.  For those of you who  have loved the Hoff for years but wondered if he could deliver in a serious drama, WONDER NO MORE!  This ruggedly tanned, handsome half-African American stud delivered the goods well before the current crop of ruggedly handsome half-African American studs like Vin Diesel, The Rock, and Heath Ledger.

The lines aren't well written, but boy howdy are they delivered with gusto by the Hoff!  Kudos to Corin Nemec as well, it's his best work since ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose.""  The only other negative in the movie is that at no time did Nemec utter the phrase ""synchronize swatches"".

If you're looking for an underated thriller with some great action, great pacing, beautiful women (Donita Rose and Victoria Pratt), and fine acting (the others were good, but the Hoff, Steiger, and Nemec are excellent!), check this underated movie out!

I JUST saw it in 2007, I wonder how many legions of avid moviegoers missed out on this fine piece of cinema because of poor marketing?  Mark my words, when they remake this with Marky Mark, Lucy Lui, Abe Vigoda, and Kirk Cameron, the original will stand out that much better.

Do yourself a favor and buy this movie for your collection.",1178668800,2,1404,4.760330578512397
7978931,5,B0000844KL,"ok,
so we know what to expect from the knightrider/baywatch guy david hasselholf but there is a glimmer of hope here for american viewers. MTV VJ donita rose costars in this movie playing a young woman raised in america returning the philippines to meet her lost father.
donita rose was raised in america and went to MTV Asia to become a world wide sensation. the ending of the movie is a little much when donita's character smooches with knightrider but let's just say KITT would be jealous.",1069286400,,492,4.666666666666667
7978932,5,B0000844KL,"I really wasn't sure on choosing a title for this review I didn't expect a box of tissues at the beginning of the movie. If you love children be prepared it's only a movie. Somehow David Hasselhoff chooses scripts where the character gets involved with a beautiful woman that equals to trouble ahead. After taking pictures he shouldn't have he winds up at the police station and a cop you know Jack (Hasselhoff)would love to belt. An excellent preformance by Rod Stieger as the bad guy chasing down lost money. I was really glued to this movie Hasselhoff gave a very strong performance as a dramatic actor before you know it the movie is over with. As with Layover the ending is very surprising not what I had expected. Rod Steiger as Sadler confronted Jack and Lana about the money...again both Hasselhoff and Steiger were excellent. Now I am waiting for a movie with David Hasselhoff, Pamela Bach and Steiger which I am sure would be a bigger hit. David keeps getting better.",1046217600,,977,4.6531791907514455
7978933,5,B0000844KL,"This movie is in line with David Hasselfoot's previously reviewed music efforts.  His long efforts with the series ""Night Rider"" created a personea that is indescribable.  Time has only served to bring into focus his unique abilities, as is evidenced in this DVD.  The commentary on this disc is particularily noteworthy.",1042416000,,321,5.254901960784314
7978934,5,B0000844KL,"This movie is one of the greatest movies of David Hasselhoff.
It is a really suspense-packed, with a lot of action and a really sexy David Hasselhoff. He is my favorite actor and singer. At the TV end titles sings David Hasselhoff a very good song. I can advisable this movie.",1042416000,2,276,4.431372549019608
