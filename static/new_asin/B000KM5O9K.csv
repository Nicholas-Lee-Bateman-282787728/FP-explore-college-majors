8158149,5,B000KM5O9K,Singning Time Practice Time is a great way to reinforce ASL skills. The DVDs are set up to randomly select words to fingerspell. It changes so you know you are really learning the words not just remembering the order. Being able to fingerspell and count in ASL are important skills to master.
