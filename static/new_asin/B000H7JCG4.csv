2748963,1,B000H7JCG4,"Yeah, this doesn't hold up very well. The dialogue is PAINFUL and so is the acting. I remember this show being so cutting edge back in the day b/c it tackled topics about drugs, sex, peer pressure, etc. Now it just seems so wholesome, dull, and completely unrealistic in any way. The fashion disasters are hilarious, though. Biking shorts with EVERYTHING. Why??",1507420800,,361,4.838709677419355

2748972,5,B000H7JCG4,"I'm super upset that I watched the first season and loved reliving all the memories of this show, only to be denied the rest of the seasons.  What's up with that?  I don't understand why Amazon would put one season there for us to watch and then not give us the rest of the series.  It seems like every show I try to put on my list is either unavailable or you have to pay for the episodes.  Why should I have to pay for episodes when I pay for a year of Amazon.  Netflix doesn't do that.  You pay your fee and you get everything free.  Can somebody explain this to me?????",1485820800,,573,4.017699115044247

2748984,5,B000H7JCG4,"Ahhh the 90's....... well this review is from a real person NOT getting paid by some marketing scene.  My wife and my step-daughter have been watching this because the show touches topic thatDO occur in high school. Now a days shows just flat out suck. There is no real plot and everything is ""staged,"" so my daughter says. She gets to see the TV shows that my wife and I grew up with. But...... what kinda sucks is that with Amazon Prime you only get to watch Season 1 and that's it. You want season two...... gotta subsribe to Hulu, really?  So DON'T get hooked on this fantastic series only to be let down by having to purchase or take their ""one week free"" trial BS. I swear this sucks-- oh well.

2749002,5,B000H7JCG4,"Amazing. I have learned so many important life lessons from this show. Lessons of hope, bravery, acceptance, care, and most importantly, love. Although not perfect, I often wish Brenda and Brandon's parents were my own! And watching those two come of age, through all life's struggles and lessons learned, brings a tear to my eye. I am tempted to say, this is the greatest television show ever made. Better than Breaking Bad, better than Game of Thrones, etc. Simply: there has never been a television show produced that reaches into such a profound level of depth, and such deep explorations of the human condition. If you have not watched this series, watch it NOW. If you have seen it, watch it again, and again, for each viewing you can see sides of the characters and story you did not catch on the first viewing, in all their complexities of love, struggle, happiness, pain, sadness, and hope.",1481932800,2,899,4.769230769230769

2749016,1,B000H7JCG4,"Very Wholly Weirdian throughout but within generally acceptable parameters until the script writers got into some heavy weight Wholly Weird malicious propaganda with Episodes 10 and 11.  Between this pair of socially unacceptable and overtly criminal presentations, I was unwilling to continue viewing beyond the midpoint of Episode 11.

Eleven was the renowned practice of poisoning the beverages of non consumers of All Co Hell to ""loosen them up""  for criminal objectives and the more general practice of poisoning children (those under the intended ""legal"" age for consuming All Co Hell) to destroy their lives before they have any chance to live them.  Demonstrated the truth that the very first thing All Co Hell does is to subvert human awareness of what that brain and liver lethal toxic chemical does so that victims don't understand what's being done to them by the criminal pushers.  Compounded by the naive impression of being able to ""clean up"" after a crew of drunk and disorderly poisoned puppies have been trashing one's parent's house (let aloneone's life which typically requires a minimum of four years without further All Co Hell consumption) and pretending avoidance is only a ""rules thing"".  The toxin is so destructive that one of Wholly Weird's poisoned puppies went so far as to sue a financial company for using the phrase ""milkaholic"" in its advertising as if it referred to her self destructive consumption of All Co Hell.

Episode Ten was a full blow reminder of the notorious ""magical"" conversion of HIV/AIDS, using a homosexual dominance ritual player known to have been subjected to nonsterile needles to treat sports injuries and most of every day in the filthy environment of ""sports"" locker rooms who was entered into a ""marriage"" to pretend he got AIDS via ""hetero"" relations, into a pretext for object rape con dumbs against heteros presented by Bush The Elder as part of the felony tax evading ""religionist"" insistence on preventing hetero connectivity in favor of the slave mongering divorce racketeering ""marriage"" swindle system and imposing the ""religionist"" hate mongering against male citizens with their ""belief"" in torturing, maiming, and murdering males as ""beneficial"" to their criminal society.  While consistent with their Wholly Weird felony religionist play actor Ronny Raygun who began the felony abrogations of Article I US Constitution Amendments hetero civil rights with object rape con dumbs in 1986-87 after Wholly Weird installed that spewer of other people's lines into the Witty Houze, the felony abrogations themselves remain unacceptable as part of any social discourse.",1477008000,,2633,5.282296650717703

I like to see what I thought was a great hairstyle or outfit or even car back then and now I wouldn't be caught dead in it. Sometimes makes me laugh. It also reminds me no matter how much has changed, some things still remain the same. There are some topics covered in this show that are still very relevant today. Do I miss the songs? Yes, but they did not make the show. They were good and added to it, but mostly I was interested in the story or what would happen next.

2749134,4,B000H7JCG4,"If you came ""of age"" in the 90s and are feeling nastagic, this is the film for you....  Of course this is only if you had a sheltered white bread life. I turned this on while doing other things around the house and at times had to stop and laugh (sarcastically in disbelief) due to some of the things that role off their tongues and we accepted. S1E5 One on One. A classic episode of the times that one would have for a film study of politics in the early nineties. Brandon is chastising a potential teammate Bc he believes the guy didn't get into the school on merit (but discovers his perception was false) says it's not black vs white or more laughably (sad) ""you're not a gang-banger crackhead and I'm not a cowboy""...in the most innocent way possible. We all know cowboy is a terrible insult to white people. Definitely the equivalent of gangbanger crackhead. Ok to clarify I am being totally sarcastic here. It's not. Despite this I love the show. It's a classic film study a perception of ""mainstream"" America in that time and for those that look back on it a great lesson in history and still even present times of classist/and shamefully at times racist America. We shouldn't ignore history Bc if we do we risk repeating the bad parts of it. I find the show ignorantly amusing and plan to finish all seasons. Maybe use it for a film study college course.",1456531200,,1363,4.473895582329317

Some of the music has a hard rock and punk vibe, and not all the original music is cut.  I may be wrong, but the guitar and synth melodies during some of the scenes, mimic the music style that defined the 80s and early 90s.",1438214400,,492,3.88

I'll take pogs, hypercolor shirts, hats worn backwards, TalkBoy (and later TalkGirl), and valet parking at West Beverly High over parachute pants, zinka, and Thriller jackets any day of the week. I remember the later seasons of the Bev 9'er having a bit more meat on the bone, but Season 1 is still entertaining and worth a good chuckle here and there, nonetheless.

Some episodes make you howl with laughter,  others cry with sorrow or sing with joy, occasionally they (the writers) hit a trifecta of all three! (yes!  those will wear you out but they are worth it!!)  No matter what the emotion,  the show always beats to the collective heart of the lovable cast.  I can laugh about it now (and hope my boss does not read this!!) but after watching 1 episode, I took the next 3 days off from work to watch all 10 seasons in succession!!!

The message of show that people need to take away is that growing up is not easy,  no matter what your zip code.  If you think money can buy you happiness,  just ask Dylan McKay (I dare you!!) if that is true!

In closing, do yourself a favor,  watch this show and grow from it.  It has helped make me a better person and buy doing so made the planet a little bit better for future generations.",1424390400,2,983,4.237837837837838

It's bad enough many of the seasons were missing episodes and a lot of the soundtracks had been changed (I get it: licensing issues). But this? This is on you, Amazon. Not right.

Well, that's not true, but it does mean that teenage behavior continues to interest me and these kids, as cool as they were thought to be at the time, seem sort of sweet and innocent by today's mores.  I keep wondering if Tori Spelling is ever going to get a line.  Must have been embarrassing for her to just stand around showing off her midriff as the others got all the dialogue, but perhaps Daddy was not being as indulgent as she might have wished.  I am enjoying the show and catching up 15 or 20 years late.  Now that everyone else has forgotten the show, I finally know what the hoopla was about.  My dad used to say, ""Too soon old, too late smart.""  That may or may not apply in this situation.

I am a huge fan of Beverly Hills 90210. I was only 10 when I saw my first episode. I bought every season on DVD and I have been driving myself mad for the last 3 years trying to find a certain song that's has played in some episodes.

The first time I heard this song was at the end of season 1 moving home episode. It has the word maybe in it. It was also played in the season 4 60's episode and when Andrea leaves in season 5. I need help, it's driving me mad.

If anyone knows what this song is please help me find it.",1403308800,,531,3.765765765765766

2749438,1,B000H7JCG4,"This was a groundbreaking show of the 1990's. And as one of the best shows, the episodes should remain INTACT! MOST of the original music soundtrack from the shows as well as whole scenes have been replaced and removed, i.e. popular bands and songs from the period, which, in my, and many others opinion have utterly ruined this release. For a show that PUT FOX ON THE MAP it deserves much better. Hey CBS, pay the sync fees for the original music and release all 10 seasons properly. This is totally unacceptable. It would be like putting out Miami Vice without Phil Collins music. In these types of shows the music is so integral to the stories and the subtext. To replace it with generic garbage music does it a total disservice.  Very disappointed.",1398643200,4,752,4.611940298507463

As a parent I would not recommend you allow your teen to watch. the issues addressed in this series are still controversal but the display is tame by today's standards. but for adults its like a good soap opera. only better because I can't stand soap operas.

Beyond that its a great show. I have to admit I've gotten wrapped up in it on more than one occassoon. The outfits in that show bring a laugh out of me every time. Its kinda cheesy but worth watching. Ejoy the time warp back to 1990.",1391040000,,641,4.297520661157025

2749663,1,B000H7JCG4,"I have loved everything about this show since its debut when I was in 4th grade. I used to DVR all of the reruns on TV, and I was SOOOO ecstatic to see them at a decent price on Amazon, so I quickly snatched up the first 3 seasons! To my UTTER disappointment so much of the original music had been changed!!! It's really sad to see a scene that used to have certain music in the back ground, which MADE THE WHOLE SCENE, and suddenly there's some music that's totally inappropriate for the year, and totally bastardizes the cheesy early 90's flow that made 90210 so fantastic! I was very disappointed and I wish that this was made clear to me prior to my purchase! And then they have Darren Star's commentaries and he completely ignores the fact that his show, that he's so proud of, has been edited so much that it no longer has its original appeal. Of course, I'm going to keep them because the show RULES despite the mid-90's ska music that sets the background for a bunch of kids in carry-over-80's clothing. If there HAD to be changes made, it could've been WAY more subtle (and someone should have done their research because having music that sounds like the Black Eyed Peas most recent album in the background of a club in 1990 is just ridiculous).",1300752000,13,1255,4.413793103448276
2749664,3,B000H7JCG4,"I just finished this season and I have to say that I found it a little bit boring. I also thought the music was so generic that it was tacky. I was a big fan of the show when it was on the air and I am not going to give up on it. I started the second season and I already like it more. It is so interesting to watch the show as a very young adult and then watch it again as a middle aged mother. Man, that Brenda was a brat!! I am excited to get some of the other seasons on dvd and hope that the music gets a little bit better.",1300406400,4,528,3.560344827586207
2749665,5,B000H7JCG4,"I never watched the show when it aired, but the reruns caught my attention years ago. I enjoyed the episodes, and they were compelling. Recently, I decided to pick up the DVDs of Season One, and I've enjoyed the show once again. Again, the acting is impressive given what they had to work with. It's much better than anything that's on television the past decade. I wanted to make a commentary of some of the episodes. First thing I noticed is how many characters appear in one episode and then be never seen again. Having said that, notice how Brandon Walsh averages a woman per show. He is also a cheat, liar, racist, and drunk driver who could have killed somebody. He is easily pissed off and starts taking somebody's head out if slightly provoked. He acts like a saint with a conscience yet he is the biggest hypocrite I've seen on the show. At this point, I have a hard time debating who is worse: him or Brenda. She seems to have the flair of being so melodramatic, no matter the situation. She tries to take advantage of every opportunity to make the parents to feel worse by creating useless spats. I actually feel sorry for the parents, and I question their ever flowing leniency. On the other hand, I liked the rest of the characters, and they seem to be fine to me, even if they have innocuous glaring faults except for Steve Sanders. One episode ""One on One,"" Brandon makes the basketball team yet we never see him playing basketball ever again in the rest of the season. Another episode where Brandon discovers how lowly paid the third world workers are, and he decides to write a report on the owner of the caf. So what happened? Really...I am still amazed how the other characters suddenly get dropped out like flies after showing up for one episode. I was thinking also where were the friends of Kelly, Donna, Andrea, Steve because it's impossible that, given their popularity in school, they were friendless before the Walshes moved in Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, I liked the issues such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity. I know there is a lot of morality problem with the show while the characters delve themselves in the immoralities of life and still think they lead a life of morals. It's a tricky thing; however, the show is watchable regardless. That's why I enjoy it. For the DVD, it has been good, and letting you know, the pilot episodes are actually contained in the Season One package. That means you don't need to buy a separate DVD of the pilot show.",1278115200,2,2577,4.604347826086957

2749673,5,B000H7JCG4,"Wow, what a blast from the past! I am thoroughly enjoying reliving my pre-teen years thanks to the ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" DVD sets. This classic cult series revolves around the 16-year-old Walsh twins, Brandon (Jason Priestley) and Brenda (Shannen Doherty), who undergo massive culture shock when their family relocates from Minnesota to sunny Beverly Hills, California. Brandon and Brenda adjust to their new lives pretty quickly, with the help of new friends Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth), Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering), Donna Martin (Tori Spelling), Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris), and of course the James Dean-esque Dylan McKay (Luke Perry). Season 1 contains some of the show's most famous episodes, including Brenda's experience manning the teen hotline, Kelly's mother's first rehab stint,and of course Brandon's DUI. Yes, the show is hokey, but I absolutely love it! The series looks great on DVD, and the boxed set also includes several cast interviews and other bonus features, which are a lot of fun to watch. I cannot wait to publish this review and start watching Season 2!",1229644800,,1089,5.300578034682081
2749674,4,B000H7JCG4,"the plot is well written, but the show is too old for me to truly enjoy it.",1224806400,,75,3.4705882352941178
2749675,5,B000H7JCG4,"Although I was too young to watch 90210 when it originally aired, I began watching it soon after it ended, and have since been watching the re-runs on TV throughout the years (mainly on SOAPnet) and it has easily become one of my favorite shows, especially Shannen Doherty (one of my favorite actresses) was a main character (aka Brenda Walsh) during the first four seasons. Anyway, I'm very greatful that this season, along with seasons 1-5 (soon to be 6 also) have been released, and hopefully seasons 7-10 will soon follow. And yes, it is disappointing that music has been changed, and scenes have been cut, but I'm still have to be able to own this show on DVD (after all, I can watch the original versions on TV, but with the DVDs, ill be able to watch my favorite episodes anytime I want!)

Although some of the earlier seasons have a lot of episodes that may be considered tacky and laughable nowadays (especially season 1, seeing as how it started in 1990!) I love them because like I said, they feature Shannen Doherty, and during season 1 you get to see her characters relationship with Dylan Mckay, played by Luke Perry (in my opinion, they will always be one of the cutest TV couples ever!)

Now I'm sure for the most part, a majority of you have heard of ""90210"" and have atleast seen an episode or two (after all, the show was on for 10 years!) but here's a brief summary of season 1, just in case:

The long-running series begins with the arrival of the Walsh family (brenda, Brandon, and their two parents, Jim and Cindy), who move from Minnesota to Beverly Hills. Brenda (played by Shannen Doherty) and her twin brother, Brandon (played by Jason Priestley) have different ways of adjusting to their new home. Brenda quickly befriends Kelly Taylor, the most popular girl in school, and begins to feel the pressures that come along with running in such a social circle (in the early episodes she gets a fake ID, sneaks into a club where she meets an older guy and lies to him about her age, and even plans on losing her virginity to him until he finds out her true age) meanwhile, Brandon has a harder time fitting in, until he befriends Steve Sanders (the most popular guy in school) joins the school newspaper, run by Andrea Zuckermann (aka the school-nerd, played by Gabrielle Carteris) and becomes friends with a cute, mysterious loner named Dylan Mckay (played by Luke Perry, who eventually becomes Brendas boyfriend and first love) also among the cast? Donna Martin (played by Tori Spelling) who is a friend of Kelly's, and David Silver (played by Brian Austin Green) a geeky freshman who is desperate to be popular (he eventually becomes part of the infamous 90210 gang) and crashes Steve Sanders car in the pilot episode when Steve drunkenly insists that he drive his car home for him.

During this season, you'll see how Brenda and Brandon adjust to life in Beverly Hills, Brendas new popular girl status, find out that Kelly Taylor isn't as perfect and problem free as people perceive her to be, how Brandon and Dylan become friends...etc...and best of all: how Dylan and Brenda meet, and the beginning of their two-year relationship (I never grow tired of watching the ""spring fling"" episode, in which Brenda loses her virginity to him!)

The thing I love most about this show is the great chemistry that all the actors have together (which you'll continue to see grow as the show progresses)

So if you still have not watched this show, what are you waiting for?!",1224460800,,3490,4.657467532467533
2749676,4,B000H7JCG4,"So with the launch of the new 90210 I decided to kick it old school and rewatch season 1. And remember why it's infinitely better than the tripe they're calling TV these days.

In season 1, the Cindy and Jim Walsh move from Minnesota to Beverly Hills, enrolling their twins, Brenda and Brandon, at West Beverly High. Life in Beverly Hills is full of trials and tribulations that the Walsh family has no experience with, including teenage drug use, rape, shoplifting, and racial tension. Oh my! Watching this season is like taking a trip back to the 90s on the oh-so-awesome train. I'd almost forgot how tragically hip teenagers were in 1990. The outfits themselves are worth the cost of these discs. Watch season 1 of 90210 when you're in the mood for a laugh and a blast from the past.",1224115200,,786,4.574468085106383

2749679,4,B000H7JCG4,"I am so happy that this show is now out on DVD's. However I really wish they had gotten the copyright releases for the music. They don't play any of the actual songs that were playing during the show. This makes a few episodes a little less than perfect. Like the episode where Brandon goes out with the teenage mom and they play ""Joey"" by Concrete Blonde. Losing that sound just takes away from the episode. I'd like to see them re-released with the right music. There were some great songs on that show. Too bad we don't get to hear them.",1219622400,,540,4.303921568627451
2749680,5,B000H7JCG4,"I started sixth grade when Beverly Hills 90210 aired in October 1990. I remember girls talking about how cute Dylan McKay was. The first episode I watched was Perfect Mom, where Brenda presumes Kelly and her mother have a picture perfect relationship. I never really ""got into"" 90210 until CBS made them available online. I watched the pilot and got hooked! The show has its lame moments, it is dated, but it is still fun to watch!!! My favorite characters are Brenda and Brandon Walsh. The Walsh family is likeable and realistic. The show isn't as dramatic as it became. Rather, each episode presents a different situation a teen might be dealing with. From addict parents to alcohol, shoplifting to abuse, as well as some more lighthearted moments, like the episode where Brenda cares for a stray dog and Brandon coaches a snotty little league team. Some younger viewers might find the show dated and irrelevant, but for the last of the ""Gen Xers"", this show is perfect.

The music, fashions, and lingo will take you back to your 1990-1991 schoolyear. I remember the high-waisted jeans, scrunchies, belts, etc. Not to mention the music- Concrete Blonde's Joey makes an appearance in One Man and His Baby. The lingo ""bro"", ""Hey B!"", and Hey D!""

All in all, check out season one. If you don't like it, at least you'll get a feel for early 90s America.",1215216000,,1352,4.72457627118644

the thing is, i like jenny garth and shannon dougherty(sp?) becuase of dancing with the stars and charmed, and also was it tori spelling in this as well ? she used to bug me but i have a lot of respect for her now after all the stuff that's happened.

SOOOO ... i started watching this show. and i've watched it ... and watched it ... the thing is, they are like adults in high school; they deal with 'real' issues, and they're not bad actors. i will be getting in more hours on the treadmill ( i watch tv on dvd while i walk) because i love this show and will want to buy the rest of the seasons.

and weren't the clothes great? lol !!

seriously, a great show. if you like drama and some light hearted fun, this is the show for you ! i can't wait to see how the show evolves. i'm sad i missed it when it was really on tv.",1213747200,,1169,3.919831223628692
2749682,4,B000H7JCG4,"This is my favorite tv series, but Season 1 is definitely not without its flaws. Certain episodes bore me to tears (""The Green Room"", ""Higher Education"", and ""April Is The Cruelest Month"" with Chandler. Yes, THAT Chandler) and Brandon has a new love interest in almost every other episode. And he pretty much ran the gamut from a friendless 'poor little rich girl"", a teenage single mother, his old sweetheart from minnesota, a supposedly talented tv actress (who was one of the most annoying characters ever), and at the end of the season Andrea Zuckerman (almost). The best episode of the season is ""Perfect Mom"". When Jackie Taylor shows up to host the mother/daughter fashion show high as a kite is just priceless. Anyway, things only get better from here up until Season 3 so enjoy it while you can.",1213228800,,804,4.75

2749684,5,B000H7JCG4,"I watch and collect lots of TV on DVD, and after watching the first season of Beverly Hills 90210 it is, by far, my favorite TV show. It contains everything that any good TV show should: great acting, characters, storylines, and plenty of addicting drama.

From the pilot to the finale, each episode is worth watching over and over. The issues in the show are issues that trigger your emotions, make you have flashbacks, or help you go through the issues you may be going through now.

At the beginning, the show focuses on a family moving to Beverly Hills and trying to get used to the way people live, the danger of their new address, making new friends and dealing with issues that they haven't dealt with before.

I fell in love with these characters at first sight.
- Cindy and Jim Walsh are the best parents, they're understanding at times, but they are still 'parents'. They are trying to get used to life in Beverly Hills.
- Brandon Walsh is an easy going teen who everyone wants as a friend. He falls for a lot of girls and it sometimes gets the best of him, but he's a great guy.
- Brenda Walsh is Brandon's rebellious twin. She is very over dramatic, it's so funny to watch her.
- Kelly is Brenda's first friend in Beverly Hills. She seems like the very conceited and stuck up rich girl, but once we get to know her she is a great friend with a lot of problems, too.
- Steve is Kelly's ex boyfriend. He is a lot like Kelly, and seems like the stuck up rich guy, but there's a side to him that has feelings and a good heart.
- Dylan is the 'bad' boy that Brenda falls for. Jim doesn't want Brenda seeing him, but beneath the rough exterior, he is one of the best guys on the show with a rocky past.
- Andrea is who we think is the usual geek who takes a liking to Brandon. But as the show progresses, we can't help but love her!
- Donna is a part of the gang who is close friends with Kelly. It's hard to understand her sometimes because she's quiet, but through the show we gain more respect for her character.
- David starts out as a freshman who can only dream of hanging out with the gang, a total geek. But in the end, David isn't so bad after all.
When these characters collide, love, drama, new friends and flings occur.

Some of the darker issues that come up include things that a lot of people go through: sneaking into clubs, losing virginity, cheating on exams, parents abusing drugs, marriages being threatened, date rape victims, discovering alcohol and drunk driving, even spending a night in jail, cancer scares, shoplifting, befriending someone who could actually kill someone, etc, etc, etc.

But it's not all drama. There are some light subjects to balance the issues out: moving to a new town, rescuing someone from dorwning, beach parties, secrets that come out at slumber parties, awful hair dyes, road trips, teens trying to rebel, and much more.

In the finale, there are very serious things happening. Will the Walshes have to leave the place where they've dealt with so many new things and made so many great new friends? A dramatic break up occurs, is it the end? The cliffhanger that occurs in the final moments of the finale will make you NEED to have season 2 ASAP!

If you are thinking about buying this season, you wouldn't regret it. I wish the show were still going today!",1205539200,,3316,4.408496732026144
2749685,5,B000H7JCG4,"I started watching in 1990 at its beginning, and I was there at the end in 2000. And now, years later, I watch re-runs on Soap network. That is how good and addictive this show was. Back then, it felt so real and so just like my life, I was excited to watch and see what would happen week to week. Now, I can re-live it anytime. The DVD is so great, everyone should buy it if they loved the show. It really brings back some great memories and some awful ones too, mostly because of the fashion. You look back and you can't believe people actually wore that. All your favorite and non favorite characters are here and even though Andrea really wasn't remotely highschool aged, you don't care. It doesn't matter because all of these actors as a whole created this show and without a single one, it would be a lesser show. The OC has nothing on this. And I really don't think any other 'teen' type show can match this.",1202169600,,915,4.264367816091954

2749688,5,B000H7JCG4,"I was insanely crazy about ""90210."" This was my all-time favorite show as a tween. Because ""90210"" really was the very first American TV show that actually spoke to kids and had real issues that everyone could relate to. During the first season we got to meet the entire gang...

Most of the eps either revolved around Brandon (Jason Priestely,) or someone else in the Walsh House. Didn't it almost seem like Brandon had a new girl every other week? Cindy (Carol Potter) and Jim Walsh (James Eckhouse) were such cool parents. I often wished that my parents were as understanding as they were, especially Mrs. Walsh. (I suppose that's what TV writers do best; make the parents look perfect?) As a kid, my favorite character was always Brenda Walsh (played by none other than the original Britney Spears ~ Shannen Doherty.) Brenda was always so forthright and honest about her feelings. Some fans have even said that Brenda was ""mean."" I tend to disagree. I think she was just a girl who knew exactly what she wanted and wasn't afraid to say it. But as an adult, watching this set, I have an entirely new fondness for Brandon. He was such a kind-hearted young man, and always so willing to go out of his way for others and help any way he could. Brandon was a total mensch. And wasn't he so cute, too? I loved when he smiled because he had the most adorable dimples.

Throughout the very beginning of season 1, Kelly Taylor (Jenny Garth) and Donna Martin (Tori Spelling, of course) were portrayed as brain-dead snobs. Donna, especially, came off as such a superficial air-head. But after you scratched the surface a little and got to know them you saw a couple of very sweet girls who were really no different from any other American teenagers.

I always enjoyed Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) and Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering.) Dylan was the quiet loner who was often the voice of reason. He's a lot like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jake-Hanson/dp/B000H7JCGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jake Hanson </a>. Like Donna and Kelly, at first Steve came off as very superficial and incredibly spoiled. But once I got to know him I saw a very sensitive young man. I love the ep during season 1, when Steve's Corvette was stolen by those 2 girls and he starts crying and Brandon tries to make him feel better.

Rounding out the cast were the 3 egg-heads, Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris,) David Silver (Brian Green, FKA Brian Austin Green) and the rarely-seen Scott Scanlon (Douglas Emerson.) Out of these 3, Andrea was the only one who was welcomed into the gang during season 1. I was never crazy about her though because she always seemed so needy and a touch on the greedy side. Andrea had somewhat of a chip on her shoulder because she was poor and the rest of the kids weren't. Over the years, David did get cool, but in season 1 he was just a lowly freshman that no one else wanted to hang around with. Except for his bff, Scott.

Here's all the eps from season one:

Class of Beverly Hills
The Walsh's get used to life in Beverly Hills. In syndication, this ep airs in 2 parts. Note: the original title of the series was ""Class Beverly Hills.""

The Green Room
Brandon meets a new girl at the beach. Note: this is the first ep with Dylan.

Every Dream Has Its Price (Tag)
Brenda doesn't feel like one of the girls while shopping with them.

The First Time
Sheryl, Brandon's girlfriend comes for a visit and stays overnight with him. See what I mean about having cool parents?

One on One
Brandon and Andrea think there is a conspiracy among school officials when they see a student who doesn't appear to be a resident of Beverly Hills.

Higher Education
Brandon's American History teacher grades the class by an unreasonable curve.

Perfect Mom
Brenda really likes Kelly's mom, Jackie (Ann Gillespie.) But she thinks differently of her when it's revealed that Jackie's just a negligent addict.

The 17-Year Itch
Mr. and Mrs. Walsh celebrate their 17th wedding anniversary.

The Gentle Art of Listening
Brenda and Andrea volunteer at a teen crisis hotline. The girls both try to help a student when it is revealed that she is getting r-a-p-e-d by some of the football team.

Isn't It Romantic?
Brenda catches Dylan taking a shower in her bathroom. Did I say how cool Jim and Cindy are?

B.Y.O.B.
Brandon and Brenda have a party when their parents are away and poor Brandon gets arrested for drunk driving.

One Man and a Baby
Brandon befriends Melissa, a senior with a baby boy who has dreams of going to college.

Slumber Party
This is one of my very favorite eps! The girls have a slumber party. Kelly brings along this total b itch, Amanda (Michele Abrams.) I love it when Bren says to her, ""you've been acting like a total b itch since you got here."" David and Scott swing by the Walsh home to spy on the girls. Steve and Brandon have a hot evening with a couple of chicks; that is, until Steve's Vette is stolen.

East Side Story
Jim and Cindy allow their maid's friend, Carla to use their address so she can attend West Beverly. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. And Brandon (the little detective that he always was, in season 1,) sets out to find out the truth about Carla.

A Fling in Palm Springs
Everyone except for Brandon and Andrea goes to Palm Springs. Dylan and Brenda get in a big fight.

Fame Is Where You Find It
Brandon gets a part on a popular TV show. He even starts dating the star of the show, Lydia Leeds (Marcy Kaplan.)

Stand (Up) and Deliver
This is another favorite of mine. Brandon decides to run for class president with Andrea as his campaign advisor. Things get out of hand when Kelly Taylor takes over. Meanwhile, Bren housesits for an older friend and learns that being on her own may not be all it's cracked up to be.

It's Only a Test
The gang takes their S.A.T.'s. Brenda finds a lump in her chest.

April Is the Cruelest Month
Brandon interviews Roger (Matthew Perry,) an all-star student, for the school paper and learns some troubling details about him.

Spring Training
This is another favorite of mine because it shows how sweet Bran was. He coaches a Beverly Hills peewee baseball team and learns how competitive and stuck-up some of the parents can be.

Spring Dance
The gang all go to ""The Spring Fling"" and Kelly becomes ""Spring Princess."" Meanwhile, Bren and Dylan slip off to a hotel room.

Home Again
The Walsh's may have to go back to MN because Jim is faced with a transfer. Andrea decides to sleep with Brandon as a going away gift. Everything seems to be back to normal when Jim decides not to move back. But at their party at The Pit, Bren reveals to Dylan that she missed her period!

""90210"" was on for 10 years, and like many fans, I stopped watching way before that. Unfortunately, after Shannen Doherty left the series it was nowhere near as entertaining. (It's almost like what happened to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-s-Company/dp/B0000DFZ5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three's Company </a>after Suzanne Somers was fired.) Because it just wasn't the same without Brenda. Should they have kept Shannen? Many of the cast members have stated that she was incredibly difficult to work with. Shannen was also famous for starting viscous cat-fights with the other girls on the show. She absolutely despised Gabrielle Carteris with a passion and would verbally berate her any chance she got. I think it was Ian Ziering who went on Arsenio (right around the time she was fired) and had a few choice words to say about her. The show still went on for 6 seasons without Shannen (I think I stopped watching by end of season 6/beginning of season 7) but it was never the same. And, none of the seasons were as captivating or groundbreaking as season 1 always was!

Why is Shannen Doherty such a compelling and provocative superstar...?

More than fifteen years before Paris, Britney and trampy Lohan burst onto the Hollywood scene, Shannen was already a household name. Shannen became one of the hardest working women in Tinseltown because of her strong work ethic and sheer determination to excel at everything she stamped her good name on.

Today, Shannen has arguably become one of the most famed American actresses. But, in the late '70's and early '80s she was just an unknown child actor. Shannen got her big break on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-Murphy/dp/B0002WZS9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father Murphy</a>, playing Drusilla Shannon on Merlin Olsen's hit family-friendly series. A year later, Shannen again garnered critical-acclaim on another wholesome program; as Jenny Wilder in the modern-classic that is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-House-on-the-Prairie/dp/B000AA4KQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little House on the Prairie </a>. In fact, Michael Landon was so impressed with Shannen's acting and professional demeanor that he invited her to appear in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-House-TV-movies/dp/B000GIXCFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little House TV movies </a>even after the series was canceled!

In 1985 Shannen stared in the cult-classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-Just-Want-to-Have-Fun/dp/B00004Y6BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls Just Want to Have Fun</a>. This was one of Shannen's first roles as a teen which also garnered her coast-to-coast exposure as a film actress. A couple of years later, Shannen was cast opposite two of the biggest teen stars (Christian Slater and Winona Ryder) of the '80s in one of the biggest teen movies of the '80s. Of course I'm talking about none other than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers/dp/B000059PPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers </a>!

In ""Heathers"" Shannen played Heather Duke, a stuck-up girl that was only interested in being as snobbish as possible. The same year that ""Heathers"" came out, Shannen also shot the pilot for a new TV series, originally titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Class-Beverly-Hills/dp/B0002235LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Class Beverly Hills </a>

A year later, Shannen's series was picked up and retooled. This time, the series was called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/90210/dp/B000H7JCG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">90210 </a>. Shannen portrayed the star of the show, kind-hearted Brenda Walsh. Brenda was actually a lot like Shannen. She was sweet, beautiful and very intelligent. And, most of all, she (both Shannen and Brenda!) didn't take garbage from anyone!

Throughout four Seasons we all watched Shannen on ""90210"" as she grew up into a young woman. As anyone who was a child of the '90s knows, ""90210"" was a huge worldwide sensation. And this was all thanks to Shannen! After the first season of ""90210"" Shannen became a bona fide star!

Shannen also more than helped put the fledging Fox Network on the map. Prior to ""90210,"" this network was simply known as an obscure TV station that more than 60% of the country did not receive! Once Shannen made ""90210"" a hit, Fox executives rolled out a ""90210"" spin-off in the summer of '92;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melrose-Place/dp/B000H7JCGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melrose Place </a>! And less than two years later, ""90210"" which begat ""Melrose,"" begat ""Models!"" Although, Shannen refused to appear in any eps on either of those shows.

In 1993 Shannen shocked everyone when she eloped at the last minute with Ashley Hamilton. Everyone was shocked, but mostly, the Material Girl was seething, when she complained to MTV about being pushed off the cover of People Magazine so that they can make room for Shannen Doherty! A week later, newlywed Shannen went on Saturday Night Live, which received some of the highest ratings, ever!

Unbeknownst to Shannen, in the Winter of '94 nude photos of Shannen for an Aids awareness-campaign were published in a men's magazine, without her approval. When a reporter asked Shannen what Mr. Spelling would say about this, Shannen simply said, ""ask me if I care!""

Shannen also stared in the blockbuster thriller, aptly titled ""Blindfold."" In this feature film, Shannen played sexy Madeleine Dalton in one of her most diverse and talked-about movie roles ever! This film also helped cement Shannen's role as a true actress with completely unique talent. Because the role she was cast in was the total opposite of Brenda Walsh!

In early '94 there was another controversy when E! News broke the story! Shannen was leaving ""90210!"" She specifically asked her producers to let her out of her contract. Shannen gave cryptic hints as to why she was leaving the series that she helped build.

Industry-insiders intimated that Shannen wanted out of the series for a two-fold reason. First, she couldn't relate to any of the other performers because most of them were all much older than her; by now, most of them were all in their twenties or thirties! And, Shannen also wanted to leave the series because, unlike the rest of the cast, she was an actual actress!

Never one to be typecast, Shannen portrayed the famed novalist, Margaret Mitchell, airing a few months after her lest ep of 90210 aired, in the Fall of '94. The movie, ""A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story"" became an instant hit! It was also around this time that Shannen yet again made headlines when she proclaimed that she was just a ""misunderstood, sweet, Southern Baptist girl!""

The following year, Shannen stared in the major motion picture, ""Mallrats,"" opposite Ben Affleck. Shannen played Rene Mosier in this cult-classic comedy. And, Ben Affleck's character's name was a homage to Shannen!

Over the next few years, from '95 to '98, Shannen appeared in a variety of movies, such as: ""Gone in the Night,"" ""Friends 'Til the End,"" ""Ticket"" and ""Nowhere."" These films all afforded Shannen some of the best reviews of her entire career! It was also around this time that Shannen caught the attention of a very unlikely individual.

Mr. Aaron Spelling invited Shannen to consider the role of Prue Halliwell in the then-untitled series. Of course by now, we all know this was the hugely successful drama, ""Charmed."" The producers of this show lucked out when Shannen chose to sign on!

Unlike ""90210,"" ""Charmed"" was science fiction, which was a totally new genre for Shannen. But Shannen totally fell in love with her new role and in fact stayed with the series for three years! Shannen even purchased a portion of the show! In 2001 Shannen experienced deja vu when the MSM reported that she was quiting another hit Spelling-series. This time Shannen kept mum as to why she was leaving, only saying that it was time to leave!

The producers of ""90210"" tried their hardest to get Shannen to come back for the series finale, but Shannen was much too busy to even consider such a fruitless project. She did consider letting the producers use images of herself from prior clips in their retrospective show, but then decided against it when no one could come to terms. (FYI: That's why Shannen doesn't appear as Brenda Walsh in any of the clips that are shown in the ""90210"" retrospective, this ep aired prior to the series finale!)

After leaving ""Charmed,"" Shannen hosted the much-anticipated hidden camera series, ""Scare Tactics."" It also goes without saying that Shannen also appeared in a variety of other first-rate movies, such as: ""View of Terror,"" ""Another Day"" and ""Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay.""

In 2006 Shannen got her own series on the Oxygen Network, ""Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty."" In this reality program, Shannen joined forces with people in relationship peril who wanted to have a little fun! In the summer of '06, Shannen appeared on Babs' ""View"" as a guest co-host. During the second segment (while interviewing Kristin Davis,) Elizabeth said to everyone, ""this is such a surreal moment for someone my age, I'm sitting next to Brenda and Brooke!"" EH, I can imagine just what you mean!!!

What's next for Shannen? She will be staring in the upcoming movie, ""Defuct."" Look for this movie in March of this year! And, Shannen just wrapped ""Kiss Me Deadly;"" a suspense-drama that will be out later this year!

Hate her...? ...Love her? Or, do you just love to hate her? Whatever you feel about Shannen, you can't deny that for nearly thirty years she has been a pop-culture phenomenon! And, unlike today's panjandrums Shannen never went kooky and has true talent!",1199577600,9,16718,5.159645232815964

Maybe this show was a little to wild for me but by today's standards, this little gem seems pretty tame now. I love Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth, they play such close friends on the show, that it was such a surrpise to me that they hated each other in real life. Rest in peace Aaron Spelling, and thanks to Darren Starr for creating one of the most important and spellbinding shows of the '90s. Anyone who was ever a fan of this show, should get season one as soon as possible.

Where are Technotronic, Transvision Vamp, where is Chris Isaak, REM, Betty Boo ??????  We waited a long time for this dvds and all we get is this piece of junk. Who did this and why????

2749706,4,B000H7JCG4,"This was my favorite show of all time... I was in high school the same time as the 90210 kids, and had the gang not had 2 junior years, we would have graduated at the same time... anyway, the reason I couldn't give this DVD set 5 stars was that I noticed the music I remembered was missing and replaced with bland, generic ""rock""-- I am guessing they couldn't get clearances for all the songs they used, but in some instances it really makes a difference!

90210 first caught my attention when they played a remix of ""Star"" by Erasure, one of my favorite bands, during the mother-daughter fashion show episode-- how cool and edgy was that?-- and hearing the song ""Doin' The Do"" by Betty Boo during the montage of Brenda getting ready for her big date with Dylan inspired me to get the Betty Boo album. I was really looking forward to both of those moments when I watched the episodes on the DVD set, and I was disappointed when neither song was used. Music played a key role in 90210, especially as the show progressed and the current pop acts would be the subject of or make an appearance on an episode (Flaming Lips, anyone?), and to not have the original music intact on the DVD set is really a shame.

I didn't think I would need to do this anymore, but I am going to have to start DVRing reruns when I can in order to capture the 90210 I remember.",1168992000,12,1352,4.298039215686274

They have changed much of the music and some of the episodes are missing key moments, as well it seems they've been rearranged.

However, with this seemingly negative criticism out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed reminiscing about my teenage years by way of reliving the whole 90210 experience.  I must say that when I was younger I fantastically lived some of my life vicariously through Brenda, Brandon, Dylan, Kelly, Donna and David.

I actually give it 4 1/2 stars-- not a five only b/c there are no scene selections; the pilot, which is listed as part 1 & 2, is not broken up, so be prepared to watch for 2 hours straight! Fine if you're not busy, but if you're always on the go, just make sure you make time for it! :)

I think that its criminal for paramount to sell them this way.  I know this because I have all of the episodes recorded on tape and I compared them scene for scene.  The DVDs are totally incomplete.  I will never buy another season.  Some of the episodes are missing scenes that help make the whole show to make sense.  These dvds make me not want to buy any show on DVD ever again.

This was by far my favourite show on television growing up, and I am still thrilled to watch upcoming seasons. But one thing that has been bothering me after watching episode after episode, is the difference in music. I noticed it right away - as i was an avid watcher of the program and even taped episodes on VHS to watch over again for my own personal use. Now i know why it took so long to get this program out on DVD - and I am quite disappointed how the producers/creators could not satisfy the artists' requests to use their music for the DVD's. I am now on the episode where the girls have a slumber party at Brenda's house - and the song missing is ""Monie Monie"". When they are all ""supposed to be"" singing it - you feel such a lack of coordination. And this is not the only situation.....there are DOZENS MORE. The music is an integral part of the show - and I certainly hope this issue gets settled for the second season, cause i would HATE to see REM's Losing My Religion gone or the fun music from the Peach Pit...watching the DVD's is just not the same as the original program :(",1164758400,26,1188,4.261061946902655

Love,Love,Loved this dvd.

However, all of the fond memories are there including all the cheesiness of the early 90's,lol. if you were a fan of the series, with original music or not buy this dvd you won't regret it. As for an earlier review that states that the episodes were on there more then once and are not in order, must have been his DVD set, mine is fine and includes all original episodes in order of air date and is in the finest quality borght to dvd for this series, Still looks grainy but I like that due to te fact that it did come from TV and it makes it original and back in the day when this series started there was no HDTV so suck it up and relive 90210.",1164585600,,1076,4.248780487804878
2749732,5,B000H7JCG4,"I agree with most of you when I say that this long over due!!!! How can there be crappy series like Laguna Beach out on DVD, when one of the most influential high school drama series isn't. This show explored issues that are both deep and controversial. I didn't realize how amazing the show actually was until I watch all the episodes again. I was only a young girl when this show came out so I couldn't understand the story line. However, now that I am 23, I can see how they pushed the limits. Such as teenage sex, drugs, pregnancy, drinking, and the breast cancer scare. Also, the role of Donna being a virgin was encouraging for girls because it made virginity seem important...I think it balance all the sex that was going on.

Now for the music issue...I was very young when this show came out so I can remember what kind of music they had, but I wouldn't care if I did. Lets see what they do about the Color Me Bad episode, can see if they use different music for that. Now that would be awful. But come on the beginnings of this show didn't revolve around music. Also, I think music became popular when the series involved the After Dark. That was when 90210 started bringing more famous bands on the show.

The only thing that I am disappointed about is that there are no Special Features!!!! How many years did they have to plan for this release!!!?? They could have included some old casting tapes or something.

All in all, I will be purchasing all of the seasons no matter what. No matter what the music is like or the lack of special features, it cannot change the plots of the series which no other series today could compete with.",1164585600,2,1647,4.375816993464053

The great music only added to it...so when I got the DVD, I thought I LOVE this series no matter what...music or not...IT'S HERE and it's perfect:0)

The issues they dealt with then are rarely talked about in the tv shows of today...shows have changed and not for the better.  There's more violence and gore...and in today's world there's far too much of that!  This show always brings back the simpler, sweeter times and it teaches everyone something.  It also reaches everyone on different levels and gives them something to talk about around the dinner table.

Bottom line...it's just awesome to have this show FINALLY out on dvd, even without all the terrific music that was used originally.",1163894400,,852,4.794520547945205

They couldn't get the rights to the original music so they replaced it with some really lame punk/rock/elevator music.  I hate it.  The show isn't the same without the original music.

If I would have known that all the episodes had the music changed I would have never purchased the DVD.

I Love the episodes and the show and could care less what the music is playing in the background when Brandon is looking for a job, or when they dance at the slumber party for like 30 seconds!!!

I knew that those replacements couldn't match the original songs but still I was hoping for decent replacements since the same team did replacements as did the originals. But the replacements are terrible and it looks like they were thrown without any consideration let alone with any kind of heart and soul the originals had. They even changed theme song in the pilot and in the first episode, in the pilot they used the theme from the second season.

The picture quality is very poor, it looks like it wasn't remastered because there are a lot of much older movies and series with much better quality.

Considering the fact that we waited for years for this to come to DVD the waiting was not worth it.

Again, since the music is an important part of this series, I would waited longer and payed more to get the original series, and not this bad try of it.

That said, the series has not lost it's original charm and it's a shame that it got sucha bad DVD edition.",1163462400,8,1166,4.3842592592592595

Although Shannen Doherty left the show on a sour note, she was definately the breakout star during her reign as Brenda Walsh!!! I had forgotten how fantastic the first season was, considering I hadn't seen this show in many years, not even the butchered re-runs. Why bother when tv shows on dvd rule!!!

I decided to make my purchase in the store on the day of release, considering it came with the show's soundtrack and a five dollar gift card!!! My only complaint is the replaced music because the music sounds so generic. Perhaps I wouldn't be so disappointed if I could truly understand why the studios have such difficulty in securing the rights of the original music. I suppose that's the hold up in releasing The Wonder Years on dvd. Thank goodness Universal released Miami Vice with it's original music, because Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight go hand in hand with Crockett and Tubbs riding in that awesome car on the open road!!!

Fortunately, the music from Beverly Hills 90210 wasn't that essential  and I'm just glad it finally got released on dvd, considering so many trash tv shows get released alot faster???",1163376000,,1283,4.744394618834081

Some contractual thing, so perhaps since Mr. Spelling's death, that gave the studios the right to change the music (I could truly care less anyways, I have all the CDs for the shows if I really wanted to listen to the music).  I tried to find VHS in Canada and in Europe and then got ripped off in one scam for a full set of tape in 2000.

Anyways, both 90210 and MP are and always will be my favorite shows.  Watching the first episode brings me back to a time where I cannot believe we wore those clothes.  I am about 3 years older than the gang in the show but still, I loved it.

FX played the reruns (I love the later seasons with Valerie) for a few years and I loved that.

2749743,3,B000H7JCG4,"I have been waiting for Beverly Hills 90210 to come out on DVD for so long.  I put in my Amazon pre-order the first day it was available.  I was always aware that some of the original music wouldn't make it onto the discs, but I had no idea just how little would make it.  While I'm loving re-living 90210, the music they've input over the original sounds is AWFUL.  It completely takes you out of the early 90s setting of the show.  Sometimes it downright changes the mood of scenes.  I remember so well that SoHo's Hippychick was playing in the club where Brandon finds his visiting girlfriend Cheryl dancing with Dylan.  On the DVD, however, they've replaced this track with some nondescript song with lame beats.  The scene goes from being tension-filled and kind of steamy with the original sounds, to truly bland with the replacements.

I'm still glad I bought the DVD set because it brings me back to a different time, but it isn't the same.  I don't know if the distributors continue trying to negotiate the rights to songs in the hope of releasing Season 1 as a set faithful to the original, but I hope they do.  I, for one, would buy Season 1 all over again.  And I wish I understood more about how these music rights negotiations work.  I would think the record labels or artists would want their music used.  It would give them far more exposure than the songs featured in 90210 probably get these days.  After all, when was the last time you heard Hippychick?",1163203200,2,1472,4.481203007518797
2749744,3,B000H7JCG4,"I'm just glad that this is on DVD. I agree with everyone about how crappy it is to have the music switched, especially on the scene where Dylan and Brenda are breaking up and it's Crowded House ""Don't Dream it's Over,"" (I don't think that is season 1) either way, that scene will die without that song, but it's better than not having this show on DVD at all, because it seems that the reason why it took forever was because of the copyright negotiations, and obviously they couldn't make a profitable deal to keep the music.

[...]

""When a song is cleared for usage on a TV show, the clearance typically only applies to television airings of the show in question. Thus, when the show is released on DVD, the rights to the song must be renegotiated in order for the song in question to be included on the DVD.

If the process of clearing the rights to the song is prohibitively expensive for the company releasing the show on DVD, or if clearance is refused by the copyright holders of the original song, a number of solutions can be chosen from. The affected song is usually replaced with a similar (sound-alike) one which is cheaper to license or the footage containing the copyrighted song is edited out; depending on the show and the television company involved. In a few cases, television shows which use so much copyrighted music such that the cost of licensing is high are withheld from release on DVD (one notable example is WKRP in Cincinnati).""",1163116800,6,1455,4.567049808429119

I mean, come on, that's a great number and it's cool they got the rights to that song.

The Special Features are kind of corny. The behind the scenes featurette is a featurette that aired on Fox back in the 9-0, it is not a new feature. The Looking Back Season 1 the recap is not a video recap, rather it's just text. Meet The Class was kind of campy.

2749756,4,B000H7JCG4,"EDIT UPDATED:
really sad to hear/find out about the changes to music.... i really hate when something is changed from it's original created intention so i am quite displeased by the news... but i guess it's better than not having it at all maybe... the music is/was a huge part of things.

one thing that really was great concerning music was there were a number of key moments and r.e.m's ""losing my religion"" was played.. if i remember correctly first it was on a romantic date with brenda and dylan, then when \brenda and dylan broke up he sat and listened to the song in that spot in his car, then another time something bad happened the song was playing in the backround.... and finally when steve was really depressed once he put that song on the jukebox.

it's just things like that in which music plays a big part in a television show or movie and to change it or mess around with it takes a piece away from it.

i am really disappointed in this whole music rights issue... alot of greedy people out there these days.

One of the best series to come out in my humble opinion... it remained strong through 10 seasons of changes and topics and did it with style and kept things fresh... adding new characters here and there and old characters reemerging all the same.

the first season is very strong i recently caught the first season on the soap tv network as it airs it daily and it was really awesome to go back and see how brandon and dylan first met and to see how david and donna was before they really found their mark in the gang also steve is much more likeable early on than later... the episode list is as follows:

1. Class of Beverly Hills
2. The Green Room
3. Every Dream Has Its Price (Tag)
4. The First Time
5. One on One
6. Higher Education
7. Perfect Mom
8. The 17-Year Itch
9. The Gentle Art of Listening
10. Isn't It Romantic?
11. B.Y.O.B.
12. One Man and a Baby
13. Slumber Party
14. East Side Story
15. A Fling in Palm Springs (a.k.a. Palm Springs Weekend)
16. Fame Is Where You Find It
17. Stand (Up) and Deliver
18. It's Only a Test
19. April Is the Cruelest Month
20. Spring Training
21. Spring Dance
22. Home Again

mathew perry appears in 19. april is the cruelest month in which he did a great job.

standout episodes of the first season in ny opinion were:

1. ""class of beverly hills""
this is the beginning of it all where brenda and brandon move from minnesota to beverly hills and face their first day at their new school and in their new lives... what's great here is to see the way brandon looked in this first season he had kind of a mullet going and had a different mouth characteristic than he does later (in fact in the very next episode) which leads me to believe he may of had some work done... i don't think he needed to if that's the case because i liked the way he looks in this episode brenda on the otherhand looks much better later on in the series.

the twins are quickly introduced to the fast lifestyle of beverly hills as they end up going to a big party which seems to be norm there.

2. ""the green room""
the legendary dylan mckay makes his first appearance in this episode and quickly him and brandom become friends... surfing is the backdrop and it is a well done episode all around.

11. ""b.y.o.b.""
bring your own beer has it's backdrop at a party which takes place at donna's.. this episode is great because it's one of the few times the straight laced brandon ever gets wasted and let's loose and it is pretty funny untill it ends up bad which is probably why he never is like that.

16. ""fame is where you find it""
this isn't really a great episode i didn't think but for some reason i found it to be very romantic in a real way... and very touching in it's romance.. a very naive brandon sort of having one of those dream moments in time where you feel as if you are in love and everything is a dream and i just think it captures that whole romantic naive young love sort of state of being... and a very romantic skating scene between the two.

21. ""spring dance""
the big dance is here and donna gets wasted, brenda loses her virginity and steve breaks down... this episode was packed with drama.

not saying the other episodes were bad just those stood out a bit at this very time.. probably tomorrow other ones would stick out more but at this time those are the ones.

i do think the second and third seasons get a little better than the first and i especially like when dana barron appears in the third season as brandon's girlfriend nikki... she is a very underrated character in the series and it was really sad to see her go when she did go... but i can't wait till that season comes out so i can relieve her time on the show.

beverly hills fans this and the future releases are a must buy and anyone who has never seen the series or has only seen some of it.. definitely worth it to see the beginnings and how it all started.",1160006400,48,4899,4.256189451022605

2749759,1,B000H7JCG4,"With all due respect to Aaron Spelling, Beverly Hills 90210 was pure soap trash. The writers on the show basically tried to mask the show's true identity as shallow T&A dreck by having some character, usually Gabrielle Carteris' Andrea, spout off about some issue like date rape or AIDS for a token five minutes every episode. This was supposed to make the show ""deep"" and ""topical."" I've got news for you: I've seen wading pools at Motel 6 that were deeper and shampoo commercials that were more genuinely topical. Everybody slept with everyone ad nauseum and, like interchangeable parts in a car, cast members who left the series were replaced by clones with even less acting talent and depth than their predecessors. And, of course, every two years or so FOX trotted out its latest tribute to 90210 where the cast members, production staff, and writers waxed poetic about what a milestone the series was, how it broke new ground, how wonderful they all were, blah, blah, blah, blah -- nauseating self-congratulations for a show truly about nothing (my apologies to Seinfeld fans). Previous Aaron Spelling shows like Charlie's Angels, The Love Boat and Dynasty at least owned up to being nothing more than superficial entertainment with a lot of giggle appeal.

This first season basically the foundation for a series that would long surpass it's expectations.

2749772,5,B000H7JCG4,I have been waiting for 90210 to come out on DVD for years. This was my favorite show for it's entire 10 year run. I am a huge Shannen Doherty fan and can't wait to watch all these old episodes again and again. I never understood why it took so long to get this fabulous show on DVD. I can't wait until November...I am sooooo excited!,1155600000,,334,4.075757575757576
2749773,5,B000H7JCG4,"Thank you to Paramount and Spelling Entertainment and everyone else who made this dvd coming out possible! I know there were problems clearing the music for this dvd, but know that there are customers just SALIVATING waiting for this dvd to come out!

This will make my Christmas season that is for sure!!!! YAAAAY!

Beverly Hills 90210 is the best show ever!! Thanks for making this dvd!!! :)",1155427200,3,393,4.764705882352941
2749774,5,B000H7JCG4,"Again Aaron Spelling put another show on the map.  The frenzy this show created was amazing.  At my school we all took turns in hosting a 90210 evening where we'd all sit around watching this and eating pizza.  I loved this show.

In the pilot, we meet Brandon and Brenda who move to 90210 from Minessota.  They try to fit in with all the kids who have money.  It's not always easy.  There are 21 episodes in this first season, and they are all adictive.  It's going to be funny to watch all the fashions and hairstyles they all went through over the time.  The one unrealistic thing they did with this show is put older 'kids' staring as high school kids but we somehow looked over that to just enjoy the fun and drama that came along each week.

I'm really looking forward to watching this fantastic series again and I can't wait till it's release.",1155427200,,850,4.356687898089172
2749775,5,B000H7JCG4,"Hooray for common sense. Roll on November, can't wait!!! All those dodgy ebay sellers will shaking in their boots, no longer making copious amounts of money selling cheap, TV recorded episodes. Well done in making this series available. I'm oh so excited, yay!!!!!",1155340800,,264,5.162790697674419
2749776,4,B000H7JCG4,"All I can say is God Bless Shannen Doherty. I lovingly refer to the only good seasons as ""The Brenda Years"".
I trace my entire youth by the career of Shannen. Thank You.",1154995200,15,169,4.151515151515151
2749777,5,B000H7JCG4,"I am among the generation of people who grew up watching this show. I was like 12 when it aired in Costa Rica. I remember I used to sit with my mom to watch it. Some people think the show was superficial and non-sense, but for me, the first 3 seasons showed a lot of values and positive messages: danger of AIDS, handycap needs, sex before marriage, self-defense, overcome learning disabilities, etc, etc. Yes, it has its ups and downs, like everything, but in the end you enjoy it pretty much.

As I said before, for me, the show lasted 3 season until the highschool graduation day. Beyond that, they did what they do to most of aaron spelling shows: take advantage of the popularity and ratings generated to trash it as much as they can by turning it into a soap opera. The same happen to melrose place and charmed.

People consider Shannen doherty as a trouble-maker. For me, she was the reason 90210 was worth it as well as for charmed. In both tv shows, when she left, that was it.

I cant wait to see all over again: the arrival of the walshes to beverly hills, getting to know new friends and new characters, getting jobs, learning that not everything should be judge by appereances and watch the characters grow up with the show.

I recommend this as a must-have to a die fan of the show!!",1154390400,2,1297,4.391666666666667
8172393,5,B000H7JCG4,"Who could not love the first season of this beloved series!?

This is the season we meet the whole gang in the teen drama! Brenda and Brandon Walsh move to Beverly Hills during their Sophomore year of high school from Minnesota and boy are they in for a culture shock! They quickly realize that even the rich kids of BH have the same issues are their small town friends did.

We also meet Kelly, Steve, Donna, David, Dylan, Andrea and Scott. As well as Cindy and Jim, Brenda and Brandons parents and Nat of course!

You'll love this series and all its ups and downs.",1526688000,,566,4.371428571428571
8172394,2,B000H7JCG4,"Nothing worse than watching season 1 and investing my time, to find out only 1 season is prime the rest arent. Come on.... i pay 12 bucks a month. Hulu offers all seasons but i can only afford netflix, my comcast and prime. Please add the rest of the series. Its an amazing series. Really want to watch season 2-10. Melrose place offers all seasons..now Beverly hill 90210 should as well. Please add it asap. Im not the only person upset over this.",1526428800,,448,4.409638554216867

8172396,5,B000H7JCG4,Love it!!! I wish prime would make all seasons available.,1524700800,,57,4.8
8172397,3,B000H7JCG4,"The show that started it all, in the way of night time soaps for younger people. I can't give the DVDs themselves many stars, because of the chacking of original music score and clunky edits to remove some of it, leaves some episodes lacking in their original impact. The music was a big part of the series and every effort should have been made to keep as much as possible in place.  Now, the show itself, while occasionally over dramatic and too serious for its own good(there was little left that could happen to Kelly Taylor in in the way of tragedy by the series finale, she was put through the ringer!) still deserves 5 stars for its trailblazing impact and willingness to go places others weren't until BH90210 came on the scene.
Still enjoyed watching the beginnings of this cultural phenomenon of my youth, but the product itself could have been so much better without the bad editing job. If you can get it cheap, it's worth a few bucks to reminisce, but not more than that.",1522454400,,984,4.52808988764045
8172398,1,B000H7JCG4,The show itself was like I remembered. But sooo disappointed to get to the end of season 1 on prime video and realize the next season(s aren't available! Why good is watching only season? I hope there are plans to release the others soon,1521936000,,237,4.409090909090909
8172399,5,B000H7JCG4,Season 1 of BH 90210 was a reminder for me of the good ol'  days before technology took over and brainwashed us and when we lived a pre 9/11 existence. Life was simpler and it was sweet. Most of the reviews are complaints about the other seasons not being available for Prime members but I can't even purchase them because of my location. I live in the Chicagoland area not Zimbabwe. Come on.,1521072000,,392,4.36986301369863
8172400,1,B000H7JCG4,"i give it one star only on it being on DVD.  Otherwise it is a really good show all the way to its last season.  I need to advise anyone buying the DVDs of this show, beware......Most, if not all the music in each episode and seasons were changed, and it is complete bs!! Especially in season 3, when  *spoiler, Brenda and Dylan break up and the song ""losing my religion"" plays on her radio/cassette tape....was replaced by some stupid song.....ugh i don't even know where else to go with that, ......the songs that were in all the early seasons of this show, were songs that were hits at the time---early 90's, and some if not all helped the storyline, I understand that copywiting issues are the reasons why they are not included....but to me...its is not worth the buy, maybe if others stopped buying it, the makers of the DVD will pony up and make it like it should be.....very thankful i have my video tapes/VHS of recording it when it was on repeats",1520208000,,955,4.445714285714286
