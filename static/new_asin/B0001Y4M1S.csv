8018269,4,B0001Y4M1S,"Being a big Cyberpunk fan and searching high and low for odd releases I decided to pick this up used for around $4 on Amazon.

First and foremost I have read a few varying reviews on the web with most leaning towards the positive. And happily I can say mine does as well.

The storyline starts off with a group of scientists who are creating cloning technology for their company. All the while there are animal rights activists breaking in left and right and destroying their equipment/facilities. Our main actor Jeff Fahey get's hurt while fighting back during a raid and eventually runs away from the company he created. Now a new Johnny 2.0 is created to bring him back, while carrying Johnny's original memories to aid him in his quest to get this defector. I don't really want to say too much about the storyline in hopes of not ruining anything. But overall the storyline took 2-3 different twists and really kept the movie going.

The special effects were better then standard TV fare but nothing like you would see in a high budget film like the Matrix etc. The acting was good and for a DVD the video quality was excellent on my Blu-Ray player. The audio was fine as well, but I really was taken aback by such high quality video on a dvd from a Canadian film.

I can easily recommend this to any Fahey fans, Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk fans, and just movie fans in general. It has an interesting story and enough plot twists to really keep it going. I was pleasantly surprised by the film being so solid.

Video Quality: A (I thought it looked excellent for a DVD release!)
Audio Quality :B (Standard fare, seemed fine)
Aesthetics: B (I think the cover art was OK, but could have been much cooler. )
Price: A (For about $4-5 used it's a good film you can most likely re watch. )
Extras: D (Just a few trailers from other crazy xenon films, some with a little bit of nudity as well.)
Overall: B (I really enjoyed this and went in with low expectations. As long as you aren't expecting some huge Hollywood blockbuster then I think you will be happy with this flick.)",1342483200,4,2062,4.473404255319149
8018270,4,B0001Y4M1S,"For fans of movies like Johnny Mnemonic, i think you'll enjoy this one.  I would have liked to see Michael Ironside in it a little more then he was, but it was still a good movie.  It wasn't as predictable as many movies are now'a days.",1145750400,5,236,4.108695652173913
