8088181,4,B000BKVRVU,"La Alegria de Vivir! The memories of my youth come back to me of the joys I lived when watching movies like this one on a matinee during my childhood! This movie is a light romantic funny comedy suitable for family viewing. With 2 of the most prolific actors in Mexican cinema back in the 60s. The beautiful Ms. Tere Velazquez and the handsome Mr. Alberto Vazquez. Ms. Velazquez plays the role of a secretary engaged to marry her older boss. Mr. Vazquez is a mechanic who also sings. Musical numbers were a staple in many of these films. So the songs enhance the story since they are romantic & related to the movie's theme. Tere & Alberto meet & fall for each other thinking that both are from rich backgrounds. A lot of funny moments happen during the course of the story by the two trying to conceal their real social status. Ms. Leonorilda Ochoa, one of the supporting actors provides many of the funniest scenes. Once in love both Tere & Alberto realize it's time to tell each other the truth. Of course all is resolved to a satisfying happy romantic ending. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!!",1470614400,,1086,4.545918367346939
