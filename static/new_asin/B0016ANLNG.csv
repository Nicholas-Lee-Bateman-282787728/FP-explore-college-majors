""When high school buddies Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton and Andre
""3000"" Benjamin decided to form a rap duo in 1992, neither knew
that they would go on to become the best selling rap group of all
time. With OutKast's platinum selling 1994 debut album,
Southerplayalisticadillacmusik, the world immediately fell under the
spell of Atlanta's best know hip hop storytellers.

Outkast continues to push the creative envelope with each album. To
date, the group has sold over twenty five million albums and won five
GRAMMY Awards, including the highly conveted Album of the Year
award in 2003 for Speakerboxxx/Love Below.  They are the only
rap duo to achieve the 10 times platinum Diamond Certification from the
RIAA for their runaway smash double CD, Speakerboxxx/Love Below.

The group's latest effort is their most ambitious project yet.
The Idlewild album accompanies their film of the same name,where the
group begins a hip hop musical to the big screen leading an all star
cast of stellar musical talent. The soundtrack's Cab Calloway inspired
lead single, ""Mighty Q"", is a throwback to the golden years and a
return to emceeing for Andre 3000.

OutKast continues to grow collectively and individually. Andre 3000
has successfully transitioned to the big screen in movies such as
Hollywood Homicide, Four Brothers, and Be Cool. Big Boi has upped
the ante in the music world becoming CEO of his own Virgin Records
distributed label, Purple Ribbon. The sky's the limit for these two
innovative performers and BET celebrates their latest milestone with
an exclusive collector's edition of the Idlewild CD paired with a bonus
DVD of the group's BET highlights and videos! Only BET Official could
make an OutKast release of this magnitude happen!
