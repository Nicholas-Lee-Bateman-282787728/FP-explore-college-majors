8019697,1,B00020VZUM,I watched the trailer and decided this was worthless.  There are no SF Lieutenants.  The lowest Officer is a Captain and he probably won't be the Sniper.  If it was a Senior NCO or a Warrant Officer I could see it.,1457827200,,214,4.170731707317073

8019701,1,B00020VZUM,"Incredibly bad production, acting, and directing...totally unbelievable in every way.

This should be one of the free ones with Prime.  I can't believe I wasted the money to watch this.  My viewing lasted only about 10 minutes before I couldn't take it any longer.

Stephen Baldwin is the best thing about the movie: everything and every one else is terrible.",1400198400,,359,4.933333333333334
8019702,2,B00020VZUM,"Movie looked interesting and I watched it despite the issues it has. The acting is mediocre and the plot is too predictable. Not worth a 1 star, but not worth the time to watch.",1351123200,,177,4.235294117647059
8019703,1,B00020VZUM,"This movie is very low quality. The kind you watch when all the paint has dried and the grass has stopped growing. I was able to discern this within 2 seconds of the opening scene, but I gave it a full two minutes. Check out the ""sniper rifle"" that the main character is holding. Check their wide open position. No cover. No sniper would no this! It's SILLY STUPID!  Apparently they cut costs by not hiring a military consultant and so they did things the way they assumed it would be done, and sadly that is far from reality. I gave it ONE STAR for TWO reasons: 1) because it was free; 2)because I could not give it less than ONE STAR. I turned it off and applied a second coat of paint to the living room walls. Now I'll watch that dry. Where's my popcorn????",1334275200,,761,4.212328767123288
8019704,1,B00020VZUM,"Bad acting, bad plot.  At the time, this movie had nearly a 4-star rating, obviously because someone liked this WAY more than they should have, resulting in me wasting part of my life that I will never get back.",1329868800,,211,4.410256410256411

Starring Stephen Baldwin as Charlie Snow; James Russo as Donovan; Yorgo Constantine as Yevon Bodnar;

During recent weekends, I had spent some leisure time to watch three action movies on cable television.

The three movies shared a common thread: the principal character was more or less a lone wolf operative, with military background; trained in covert operations & skilled in weaponry.

Although they did not have the plot intensity or complexity when compared with any of the recent 'Bourne' or even 'Bond' movies, they were generally entertaining.

For me, entertainment comes first when I watch a movie.

The first one was 'Target' starring Stephen Baldwin as Charlie Snow, an army sniper, previously working for the Agency.

In an earlier scene, Charlie had killed the brother of a Serbian arms dealer, Yevon, during a covert operation in a remote region of Turkey. Upon returning to the United States, he found that Yevon had set out to hunt him down for revenge. The latter had also kidnapped his wife & a deadly cat & mouse game ensued between the hunter & the hunted.

With the courageous help of a computer operator at the Agency & the close collaboration of another operative, Donovan (played by James Russo), Charlie managed, through a series of tactical manoeuvres & almost risky misadventures, to trace & locate the whereabouts of his wife. He finally neutralised the terrorists at an abandoned jail block in Los Angeles.

In between, there were some rather amusing moments when he got entangled with a beautiful busker with a guitar (played by Tammy Krull). In fact, she was the one who provided the final & vital lead to possible whereabouts of Charlie's kidnapped wife.

I had also found it quite intriguing to watch the tapping of the vast resources of the Agency: remote sensing of cell phones & thermal imaging of building locations to pinpoint &/or isolate human targets.

On the other hand, I noted that the movie had inadvertently put the two bungling LAPD cops in rather bad light. I reckon this was quite typical of Hollywood, especially when the role of cops did not fit the primary focus of the movie.

To my disappointment, Stephen Baldwin as Charlie appeared rather 'bored' as an army sniper. When he talked, he was almost like he was reading a script.

I had watched this actor in some earlier action movies, like the 'Beast of War', which I had already reviewed in an earlier post, 'New Eden' as well as 'Biodome'. Somehow, he did not impress me, but that impression did not deter me from watching his other movies.

Nevertheless, I would say 'Target' was still entertaining for me as an action movie.",1192579200,3,2642,4.857461024498886
8019706,1,B00020VZUM,"This film was worthless.

Not een a bad TV movie. Who could rate it higher than an ants behind. Fat snipers don't work for our government.

The only worthwhile part of the film was the interrogation of Baldwin.

This is a film so cheaply made that it could be a Home video. The acting was not even that good. The only beleivable character in the film was??",1115683200,4,356,4.2835820895522385
