5062369,5,B0077PHME8,"My husband and I saw the movie together in the theaters last fall and were blown away.  I've always thought one had to choose either creation or the science of evolution but the movie captivatingly shows how the two actually align.  Definitely worth buying to watch over and over again, and a great movie to watch together as a family.",1335052800,6,335,4.566666666666666
5062370,4,B0077PHME8,"I saw this movie in the theater last year and enjoyed the entertaining combination of science, religon and personal relationships.  It will appeal to people from high school age through adults.  I plan on purchasing a copy for our DVD library and copies for my college age niece and nephew.  I hope to see more movies from this production company!",1334880000,8,347,4.75
5062371,5,B0077PHME8,"My husband & I both loved the movie. I am very excited to see it on DVD. Just placed my pre-order for myself and one for a fathers day gift! To be honest I did not know if I would like to science portion of the movie, and was happy it did have a little love story also. But I ended up loving it all! Was very easy to follow as well as entertaining. Don't be scared away by thinking it will be too much science or ""over your head"". Makes you think during and after the movie. Cannot wait to watch it again when my dvd comes in. Thanks Amazon for letting me know you now have this movie! Grab some popcorn and have a happy movie night for the whole family. Although very family friendly it would be best for junior high age & up to fully understand.",1334102400,8,747,3.986666666666667
5062372,5,B0077PHME8,This is a great movie that challenges a person's beliefs.  It is well written and examines angles of creation that I never considered.,1332979200,11,134,4.826086956521739
5062373,5,B0077PHME8,"This is a great movie..story,acting,special effects,all are very well done. Watch it with some friends..you'll have lots to talk about.",1332806400,7,135,5.8
5062374,4,B0077PHME8,My wife and I enjoyed this movie as it took us somewhere that I didn't expect to go !  I was surprised at how well done the science part was and wondered why they didn't teach science this well in high school. Everyone in the movie did a great job with their part and the story will definitely make you cry !,1332720000,11,308,3.967741935483871
5062375,5,B0077PHME8,"I was excited the Genesis Code finally came out on DVD.  After seeing it in the theater, I was anxious to see it again, to think about how they bring along the science of creation with the Bible's story.  The characters are great - love the other stories going on in the movie too..and the surprise ending :)",1332374400,9,308,4.293103448275862
5062376,5,B0077PHME8,"After having seen this movie in theaters, I can't wait for it to come out on DVD! A good for the whole family movie that does more than entertain you - it makes you think. How do God and science mix? Whether you're religious or not, this movie will both entertain and provoke a little deep thinking - something often missed in today's movie experience. Overall a great movie experience that will leave you wanting more.",1332374400,12,419,4.526315789473684
5062377,5,B0077PHME8,"God created the universe.  He also created science.  Therefore, science and faith have to be in complete agreement.  This movie shows how faith and science are in agreement in a provocative, new way with well accepted scientific theory developed by Albert Einstein.  The best part of the movie is when Kerry is told by her professor that she must loose her faith if she wants to pursue a career in science. The interaction between Kerry's father and the professor is priceless.  The movie makes you think about issues of faith and science, living out your faith in a post-modern society and end of life matters.  Well done.",1332288000,108,623,4.775700934579439
5062418,5,B0077PHME8,Whoa this movie had me thinking.... I loved the connection with the bible and science and the actors where really good....

5062438,4,B0077PHME8,"This movie is worth watching just to see Logan Bartholomew. He is really good in this movie. Sometimes the dialog got a little long-winded and slow, but overall we enjoyed the movie.",1462320000,,182,4.71875
5062439,5,B0077PHME8,"What can I say? Both science AND faith are indeed true. Blake (Logan Bartholomew) definitely lost his dad and he almost lost his mom, so he had almost unbearable stress with his grandparents who approved of her request to be off life support. Kerry (Kelsey Sanders) meets him at a well needed time, and gets concerned for his mom and him when she finds out about her hospitalization. Blake and Kerry develop a serious friendship which develops into a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship near the end. She faces a choice brought down on her from her academics advisor to either forfeit her career or her faith, but retains her faith. Blake brings up Matthew 4:8-10, where Jesus was tempted to worship the devil to receive the kingdoms of the world and their glory, but commanded him to flee because we are called to worship God and serve Him only. Kerry also stands by Blake's side when he hears about his mom nearly dying (when he says he is going to see his mom, Kerry says ""I'm going with him). This is what true friendships and relationships are about--being there for each other like Blake and Kerry are!

So, I am touched by what happens between Kerry and Blake as well as what the moral of this movie is about!",1458604800,,1214,4.594470046082949

5062443,1,B0077PHME8,Completely false portrayal of the Bible and the truth about creation. Questionable material that would not be in line with what the movie claims to be. Worst movie. It is sad and a shame that its called a christian movie.,1452211200,,221,4.55
5062444,5,B0077PHME8,Decent movie with interesting perspective.  Science confused younger children.,1449964800,,78,7.666666666666667
5062445,3,B0077PHME8,"Pretty standard religious based movie. Brings in some emotional everyday situations and tries to tie them to a life lesson based on Christianity. The message was OK, but this basically just reinforces your believes but lacks a compelling way to bring in agnostic believers, like myself. The explanation of time and space to prove the existence of God doesn't stick with me but it does explain how people view the Earth being created in 7 days.",1448236800,,443,4.842105263157895

5062449,5,B0077PHME8,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, and quite honestly, the only reason I bought it was because Ben Murphy was in it, Ben being of Alias Smith and Jones fame as Kid Curry/Thaddeus Jones. The 2 lead characters are played by actors I have never heard of. Even reading the description on the case didn't fill me with much confidence in the picture. Well, it is with great pleasure to announce that I was beyond pleased with my choice. I truly did not expect the kind of depth this movie portrays. It does deal with faith and God and it does so without trying to shove any ideals down your throat. I do believe in God, I hold tight to my faith, we are supposed to plant the seeds, not bludgeon others with it. This movie handles it perfectly, reinforcing the faith of those who have it and giving non believers something to think about. Handling this topic walks a very fine line, and they did an outstanding job of doing just that. Whether or not you have faith, or believe in God or not, give this movie a try. I really think you'll be taken in as I was by how well they handle this topic. Highly recommended.",1445385600,,1117,4.273584905660377
5062450,2,B0077PHME8,"Good for a MST3k-laugh but not much else unless you are a super right-wing Christian.
I only got the movie because I was an extra in it without realizing how bad it would be.
Look for me in the background of the cafe scene after church when they talk about baseball statistics. I have a mustache and am wearing a black sweater with a stripe across the chest.",1445212800,,358,4.279411764705882

5062457,5,B0077PHME8,"I have always maintained that I had no problem with the scientific explanation or the Biblical version of how we came to be.  I've said, ""no one knows how long one of God's days is.  This movie explains just that and shows how people of faith and people of science can just ""get on with it.""  I love this movie so much that I bought it for others I love.  Great movie, good acting, there are cameo performances by name actor.  Loved this move.",1439856000,,443,4.226190476190476
5062458,4,B0077PHME8,"Clean, honest movie that explains that science does in fact go hand -in-hand with The Holy Bible's book of Genesis.  It was a fun process to see the scientist work with the christian ministers.  I have always found it easy to understand that both are correct, but it I could see why it might be helpful for others who don't understand it.  IS IT COMPLETE TRUTH?!?  I am not sure.  Who is?  But it was an entertaining movie for 13+. The only downfall of ""The Genisis Code"" is that it felt rushed.  At times it felt like too much information was placed into too small of a time frame.  Perhaps if it was made into 2 movies it would have been better.",1438041600,,647,4.245901639344262

5062464,5,B0077PHME8,"This was not the movie I thought it was, however it was more than worthwhile.  It provided interesting explanations about creation vs evolution.  The story line supports the creation theory and it validates both creation and evolution.  It also dispels the idea that theology and science are two separate forces and how they both work together.  In short, everything that science explains is part of God's plan.",1434240000,,411,5.08955223880597
5062465,3,B0077PHME8,Bad acting.  Most Christian movies have christians in it.  Ben Murphy is an Atheist playing a Christian.  Poor choice.  Not believable at all. What I love is that the science behind it completely true.  I googled it!!!!!,1432944000,,220,4.837837837837838

I liked the movie. As someone who believes in God and also believes in science I understand what it's like to struggle to make sense of things sometimes. I don't know if the concept in the movie is completely made up or if there is truth behind the science, but it sounded good to me!

5062479,5,B0077PHME8,"Somebody put a lot of thought into this movie, and worked hard on the script.  The scientific terms are all used correctly, which is pretty amazing for a small production, and much, much better than Hollywood does.  The Genesis Code of the title is an intriguing way to harmonize the Genesis account with the geologic/cosmologic reconstruction of Earth and the universe's history.  It won't appeal to some people and won't answer everyone's objections, but in a two-hour movie which had to have a plot too, they've done a very, very good job.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in how Scripture and science can harmonize, as one more way they might fit together.",1416614400,,671,4.808695652173913

But I still struggle with geologists findings of the earth being many million years old and how it conflicts with the Bible. This movie helped me understand that God's days could have been different then the 24 hour days we now have. However a God that can create the universe can also create the things that lead us to believe the 24 hour day. As a believer I know that God sent His son to die for me, I also know that some day I will be with Him in heaven and have answers to these questions (if I still care!)",1413504000,,590,4.051282051282051

It totally skips the ""Day-Age"" (old) argument stuff, and actually parallels the scientific time vs. God's time.  I was brought up in a strict straight Bible belief of the 7 days of creation.  (My mother and I still argue it.)  This movie finally showed me what I knew had to be buried in science that explained how the Bible is not at war with the science; science just had to figure out how God really showed us creation according to His time.

5062492,4,B0077PHME8,"While some of the actors seem lacking in authenticity, the story line is a contemporary one that most of us would recognize at some level. Science or God seem mutually exclusive in most conversations, but this movie does a great job of showing a different, but to me, satisfying perspective. Perhaps it is both!  Creation is creatively explained in a way that I felt consistent with Genesis. Most characters rang true, and seemed like people I might have encountered in university or church. It was a very engaging film, and I think that it's worth a viewing.",1410998400,,559,4.762886597938144

During my years as a teacher of youth in church as well as a high school nurse, this would have been a great movie to recommend or show to students to broaden their understanding of how God's truth on the creation of life and this world are not as ""far-fetched"" as some pseudo-scientist make it appear.
Unfortunately, many kids who grow up in churches don't have a strong foundation on biblical truths as they relate to real life and allow themselves to be shamed into buying contemporary science's theoretical view of how our world was created.
The 20 minute segment within the movie that breaks down creationism and merges it with known scientific principles is worth taking notes on and exploring further.

5062527,4,B0077PHME8,"I read some of the other negative reviews, but interestingly enough these people also don't offer any input, theories, or ideas.

This movie has some very interesting points, for example, it reminded me that the bible was written in God's perspective, not human perspective. Days for God are completely different than our human 24 hour clock. Our minds are programmed to think in 24 hours, so when reading the story of Genesis, we automatically picture our time not God's timing.

A Christian journalism student has to interview the university hockey star athlete. They find out they have a lot in common, and become friends. She slowly *leads him back to Christ. She also influences her brother an astrophysics student (who is not a believer) to know Jesus. She gives him a verse in Psalms 90, and he uses this verse and matches it science.

I felt the script could have been written better. The behavior coming from the academic counselor was really annoying and unrealistic.

The scientific explanation was very fast and puzzling; he should have explained in simpler terms. I have younger relatives who could've gotten confused over that explanation (even though the theory is very interesting.)",1387843200,,1198,5.0353535353535355

There are not enough loose ends for me. The nerdy brother is led by science to affirm a new meaning for the seven days of creation (the ""Genesis Code"") suggesting that Christians have an insider's knowledge (or ""gnosis"") that sets them apart from non-believers. But that knowledge isn't about Christ, it's about how the world was formed. And the healing granted miraculously after prayer is also too pat for my understanding of Christianity. This is less about sin and grace than it is about who is right. But then, this is entertainment, after all, not instruction in the faith.

5062537,1,B0077PHME8,"This film was terrible on many levels.

Its plot was lousy.

As was the acting. (Strangely, almost all the characters had ultra thin lips, like faceless demons.)

The person portraying the pastor acted like a cold-as-ice know-it-all, with no emotions, just a machine churning out sanctimonious condescending advice.

Worst of all this film totally capitulates to evolution. It just finds a clever mathematical way to stretch out the bible's six days of creation to correspond with the alleged 16 billion years of universe history. This idea was taken straight from the books of Orthodox rabbi and MIT physicist Gerald Schroeder:  http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?ie=UTF8&field-author=Gerald+Schroeder&search-alias=books&text=Gerald+Schroeder&sort=relevancerank

Reputable scientists ranging from Henry Morris to Jonathan Sarfati to Benjamin Carson have clearly demonstrated that even 16 billion years will not suffice to allow evolution to take place. The impossible is not rendered probable by adding more time!

This is a rotten film: bad plot, bad acting, and a total betrayal of the biblical message that God created each species to propagate after it's own kind! This is the opposite of evolution.

It is crucial to realize that DNA acts to prevent macro-evolutionary change. It is shaped like a spring to express its role to permit small adaptive changes to preserve the species from environmental shocks, but it absolutely resists large scale evolutionary change.

5062539,2,B0077PHME8,"Watching as much as I could of The Genesis Code, it was immediately apparent that this movie couldn't do justice for either side of the science vs. religion debate.  From the forced chemistry between the two main characters to the terrible dialogue...I had to salvage the rest of my free time by turning it off.

Blake throwing a little stank on the word ""Christian"" made it seem like poor Kerry was from another planet (atheists insert joke here), rather than a part of the world's largest religious community.

Subject matter such as this attracts me.  I think all of us go through (or should go through) a period of self-reflection regarding our beliefs and moral foundation.  As thinking individuals, we crave meaning and direction in life.  We also enjoy being inspired.  Regarding my past issues with religion, I sometimes explain to friends that I didn't ""find Jesus""...I found a therapist.

I think most atheists would agree that their views often stem from early life experiences: An overbearing religious environment, indifference about religion, or bad experience(s) - just to name a few.  Adolescence usually fuels the cynicism, and contemporary culture typically justifies festering resentment or a lack of any in-depth meaning to religion.  Those who participate in religion are usually depicted as ignorant or dangerous (a la: Religulous).  While the multiple theologies are often generalized or vaguely summarized, it's hard for a growing number of people to find value in religion.  The sad tension builds as a result.

Speaking for myself, I decided religion wasn't for me.  My folks were relatively devout, but never explained much to me.  Certain things I heard, read, and experienced only compounded my confusion and disinterest in being religious.  Eventually I came to the conclusion that all of it was nonsense.

I have a strong interest in studying history, which led me to reevaluate a number of things in my life.  I started to obtain a better perspective on how certain religions developed, how the bible is interpreted, and the general attitude of people I've encountered who practice a religion.  It's interesting what dedicating a little research does for acquiring knowledge, insight...and gaining some maturity.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still pretty much an average schmuck with plenty of issues.

It could surprise many out there to know that there is a Christian religion that does not look to the bible for historical or scientific guidance.  It also advises that attempting to force someone to have faith is sinful.  It embraces medical and scientific research, natural law, creative thinking, and even discusses the theologies of other religions.  But most importantly (and this is a benefit for non-believers), it teaches that good works in union with faith will offer grace (not sola fide - please look this up).  The latter being the key difference between Catholics and Protestants.

Before this comes off as a cheering session for Catholicism, let me first say that Catholics have done a horrible job even discussing the nearly two-thousand year old history and details of the faith.  Clearly, there is plenty to resolve regarding abuses of children, money, etc..  There were plenty of terrible things in history done on behalf of the church.  There are, and will be, foolish people in ALL walks of life.  But what if maybe - just maybe - someone adheres to the very basics of their Christian faith?  Treat others as you would yourself.  The Ten Commandments.  Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's... -- It seems to me that society would remain fairly civil and productive.  While theology is a struggle for many within and without religion, let's not dismiss the compassion and kindness of the majority.  In my book (and I suspect the book upstairs too), these are the things that really matter.

My recommendation: Do not look to this movie for guidance.  Research on your own to find what offers the best answers, not just in science and nature, but for a positive direction in life.  Please don't rely on just one source.  Faith (or lack thereof) is something very personal.",1379462400,2,4132,5.038348082595871

5062552,5,B0077PHME8,"I just watched this movie and I give it five stars for one main reason.  They presented the case for time dilation and inertial reference frames to explain why God says he created it all in six days when the physical evidence on earth and in the heavens says it took billions of years.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't mention any references or present any math, but they made an excellent heuristic argument.

I first read this explanation over a decade ago in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Science-of-God/dp/1439129584/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Science of God</a>&nbsp;by Gerald L. Schroeder.  You can see the switch in inertial reference frames in the Bible somewhere around Genesis 2:4.  It makes excellent sense, but I've been disappointed to not find anyone else taking up the view--until now.

(Neither the movie nor the book mentioned that crystal oscillators in GPS satellites have to be manufactured to run measurably slow on earth so they'll run at the correct speed when they're lifted away from the earth's gravity, but I also enjoy that practical demonstration of time dilation.)

One other event in the movie that was very enjoyable was a minor scene in which the father tried to help the guidance counselor see that her intolerance of religious beliefs and her belief that there are no absolutes are in fact religious beliefs which she holds absolutely.

Sorry, I'm not a hockey fan, so I fast-forwarded through those parts.

Movies made by Christians always have a different feel than secular movies for a number of reasons.  It seems that most secular movies feel the need to put the slimy, vulgar side of life right up front with insults for fun.  Christian movies obviously don't.

5062572,3,B0077PHME8,"I found the secondary part of the story, about Blake's family more interesting and inspiring than the rest and would have liked to see more about it. It was heartwarming to see that Blake, a tough hockey player, finally realizes that God is much more than a myth and that prayer does change things.
Other than that, I didn't find a whole lot of positives or Christian values about this movie and that's the biggest let-down, since this is supposedly a Christian movie. The first disappointment came when Kerry tried to interview Blake, part of that conversation is totally inappropriate. I was also left with the questions: Why would Kerry, a `committed Christian' meet with some rowdy, non-Christians in a bar? Why couldn't she at least have tried to defend her beliefs when confronted by her academics advisor? For those reasons this came across as superficial Christianity. I did like the character of Kerry's dad, `a man of the cloth'; who for the most part, was insightful and seemed like a genuine leader.
Then there's the well delivered but still long-winded presentation by a group of college students.  Led by Kerry's brother, Mark, (who did an excellent portrayal of a nerdy science guy), they attempt to describe how the Bible and science agree with each other. I tried to grasp their scientific explanation of how the world came to be, but got lost in outer space, somewhere in the first million years. This, which according to the title is the key element to the story, just didn't work for me, because no amount of science babble changes the fact that God created the world. And there's nothing complicated about the way it's presented in Genesis, the first book of the Bible. Rather intriguing though, that the writers/producers came up with this plot of creation and evolution being in sync somehow.  The Genesis Code is a movie with a poignant and real secondary story intertwined and spoiled with a far-fetched and shallow tale, and is not something I would recommend to anyone.

The acting was very good. I enjoy hockey, in fact I use to play so that was a good bonus too.
All of the actors did a good job from the two main stars all the way down to the actors
who had a far lesser role.
The story was deep.
The movie even had some comedy and it was written very well.
The ending was VERY GOOD and it will greatly uplift you.

Cons -
They spent about 25 minutes in the middle of the movie trying to explain
the book of Genesis. I actually fast forwarded past a large part of this
because their theologies were very different than what the bible says,
or what GOD has been teaching me. I found these 25 minutes to actually be offensive
because they ignored some very basic principals in the book of Genesis.

Besides their theological errors, the move was very well made and I can still
highly recommend it as long as you realize their explanation of the creation
might not agree with what you have been taught.",1356652800,,948,4.174863387978142

5062594,4,B0077PHME8,"My wife and I enjoyed this video which we downloaded from Amazon.com.  It has a good human-interest story involving one of the main characters, Blake, his mom, and his grandparents.  The thrust of the movie seems to be to show that the Bible is compatible with evolution, and, in doing so,  the presentation runs into theological and scientific difficulties.

If the Bible is compatible with evolution, then there would be billions of years of death and destruction before Adam and Eve came along (as seemingly shown by the evolutionary intepretation of the fossil record), whereas the Bible makes it clear that death came into the world only when Adam sinned.  This of course is the whole reason why Jesus Christ came to the earth, to reconcile a lost world to God.  (By believing in Jesus a person is forgiven of his sins, and freed from the shackles of the sinful nature that was inherited from Adam.)  The real reason for the fossils is the Flood of Noah, which covered the whole world.  We observe sedimentary rock and fossils over the whole globe, even at the tops of mountains.  This is one of the areas where the Bible is very compatible with observational science.

To suppose that the Bible agrees with evolution also makes the Bible very unscientific for another reason.  One hundred and fifty years after Darwin, leading evolutionists at leading museums have  admitted that we have fewer transitional forms (animals and plants transitioning from one kind into another) than in Darwin's day.  Please see Luther Sunderland's helpful book, Darwin's Enigma.  Darwin had next to nothing of  transitional forms in his day and this was of major concern to him.

The ""physics students"" in the movie attempt to bridge the gap between the days of Genesis 1 and the billions of years of evolution by bringing in Einstien and his theory of relativity, particularly how time is looked at differently depending upon the frame of reference.  They use Einstein's thought experiment of two twins: one travels at the speed of light through the universe, the other stays at home on earth.  These twins see time differently.  The inference  made from this is that God saw time in  billions of years as He created the heavens and the earth, but man saw time only in terms of 24-hour days.  This was all that man could understand, or so it is supposed (there is an evolutionary assumption of cave men here.)  Here we run into another theological problem if we take a good look at Exodus when God gave Moses the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai.

In Exodus, it is clear that God is communicating to Moses about literal 24-hour days, and is referring to the days of Genesis as also being literal.  This is the only way that God's conversation with Moses can make sense, since God tells Moses that man should work 6 days and rest on the seventh, just as He did Himself when He created the universe and the earth and all life on the earth.  To suppose that God was thinking of a different time frame, in terms of billions or millions of years, leads to absurdity.

From a scientific point of view (and I write as a science teacher) the scientific case for Einstein's supposition regarding the twins is not so scientifically sound as the ""physics students"" declare.  The late Dr. L. Essen, a world authority on the measurement of time, questioned the data used in a scientific experiment to support Einstein. He was the inventor of the atomic (cesium) clock that was used in the experiment.  He evaluated the data of the two experimenters, even data that had been ignored by them, and said that they were not warranted in their claim of support for Einstein's notion of time dilation.  Dr. Essen found it very difficult to get his contrary views published in any scientific journal, so sure  is the scientific community of Einstein's theories.  But other scientists have also questioned Einstein as has been pointed out by Dr. Thomas Barnes in his book Physics of the Future.  It is from his book that I drew upon the information about Dr. Essen.

I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to the viewing audience, but I would ask them to be cautious about the ""science"" presented.  There definitely is a difference between the known principles and laws of science and evolution which has virtually no scientific support.  The one is quite compatible with the Bible, the other is not.",1352505600,3,4371,4.750663129973475

5062602,2,B0077PHME8,"One important detail that I found to be a letdown was the application or theory as to how time was considered to be different billions of years ago. They used the term ""time dilation"" to refer to how time has been slowing down since the inception of life and the existence of time itself has slowed down over billions of years. This is supposed to explain how we possibly misinterpreted the six days of creation in the Book of Genesis as representing a period of billions of years. But the universe is not expanding while time is slowing down (this is exactly what the science geek brother said in the movie, by the way). The universe is expanding and time is speeding up. So this completely negates the whole theory provided in this movie.

On a slightly different note, the only way time dilation can truly apply is if some race of beings were watching the development of our planet from, I don't know, say some several million light years away perhaps? I'm no science buff by any means but for this time dilation to make sense it seems like someone would have to be recording this information from a very far off place in the universe to create this ""code"" of time discrepancy. And I don't buy that God would provide this information in this manner so that we are left to struggle with some cryptic message that we can unlock after finally arriving to the 21st century. If that were true then why bother accepting the Ten Commandments at literal face value? Weren't the Ten Commandments told to Moses by God also? And wasn't this the case with the Book of Genesis? So why is one thing told to Moses (by God) accepted and understood as literal while another is metaphoric or now involving ""time dilation"" theories necessary to prove validity? It just all gets convoluted if you ask me.

SPOILER ALERT: (please don't read if you plan on seeing the movie because this sort of gives away the end)

What really annoyed me was how the comatose mother(suffering and dying from incurable pancreatic cancer) magically regains full consciousness toward the end of the movie after her son involves others in a group prayer. Then within minutes, she's all bright eyed and bushy-tailed as if having taken a ten minute nap and is all refreshed - whipping her neck around, engaging strangers and familiar faces and appears as sharp as ever. To my understanding this woman had been in a coma for months. People simply don't snap out of a coma looking all peaceful and fully cognizant. Muscle atrophy and severe weakness, bed sores, weak vocal cords, shock, extreme incoherence, overall body aches and pain, excessive dry mouth just to name a few are the maladies that dying people experience when waking up from a coma. It was so poorly done and looked incredibly unrealistic. I swear, she was so chipper and upbeat I thought she was going to jump out of bed and offer people coffee and fingers sandwiches like some accommodating hostess for all these unannounced visitors.

If you go into this movie expecting pure fantasy (which also include the inconsistencies I mentioned previously) mixed in a confusing manner with possible, albeit irrelevant theories, then you might like this movie. I, for one, was hoping for some integrity to leave me pondering some realistic possibilities. Instead, I was disappointed with incongruity and a overly syrupy sweet ending that is an outright insult to any person with average intelligence. I get annoyed when watching ""Disney"" crap with perfect story lines that always have perfect happy little endings. The only reason why I'm giving this movie two stars is because the acting, at times, was quite good. At other times the pastor father and the paleontological professor had some really wordy lines that came off as too contrived and unnatural. But hey, they all seemed like above average actors for not being major, well known Hollywood players. They're just doing their job memorizing loquacious line after line.

This is how he based the view that we are greater then our surroundings etc...

Since that time we have learned that Science has proven that the eye only reflects the light creating vision.

Augustine's philosophy created an idea that even scripture, unless proven, was fallible...

So here is the question that I have... is God all powerful, all knowing, and is the scripture which claims to be the 'inerrant and inspired word of God' true?

If so why do we look at it through the lens of Science instead of Science through the lens of scripture?

This movie was well acted, well scripted and played out.  For that I can not fault it.
My fault with it is more one of factual, credible and reliable truth.
Not even a debate of creation vs. evolution.  Big bang vs. God said it...
But this:
If Sin and death didn't enter the world until Adam and Eve sinned as scripture states, then how could this proposed theory be true.
How could entire species such as dinosaurs have lived and died before Adam and Eve... or even with that, how about the Missing links that would have died...

We were then GIVEN the topic and if we were for or apposed...
I was on a very difficult one as I had to argue for the removal of all Handicapped parking spaces on federal and public property.

5062611,2,B0077PHME8,"While the movie itself was very good, engaging, entertaining, etc., the final solution, so to speak, arrived at to link science and the Bible still leaves in place the 6 literal days not millions of years question by referring to ""two extinctions"".  The Bible is clear that there was no death until sin entered the world.  There could not have been extinctions of created life prior to the creation of Adam and Eve (day 6) and their fall into sin some time later.  Death is a direct consequence of the Fall and it affects all life.  So, as much as I enjoyed the film, this flaw prevents me from recommending it.  Because it doesn't fully answer the conflict between secular science and creation science, it actually does more harm than good.  Many may say it doesn't matter whether it was 6 literal days or billions of years but it does matter.  Genesis is the foundation, the beginning of God's revelation to us.  Once you start to question the truth of Genesis it opens the door to questioning the entire Bible.  It is supremely important that we take God at His Word.  He said, ...and it was evening and morning the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth days.  We can't pick and choose what in Scripture we (finite human beings that we are) agree with and what we don't.  We, the church, are losing our kids to the world and this issue has much to do with why this is happening.  There is no inherent conflict between Scripture and science.  But when some, whose agenda is known to have been removing God from the picture of our lives, began to theorize regarding origins, too many Christians, seeking to fit it, took the position that evolution/millions of years fit in with the Bible.  They don't.  Even science now recognizes that evolution is not fact and is unprovable; the millions of years was added as it would take that long to even make it remotely possible, not at all probable, based on what we know from observable science.  All of that to say I cannot recommend this movie.  Too many Christians are biblically illiterate and would totally miss the significance of this film's flaw.",1341532800,18,2103,4.622641509433962

5062618,3,B0077PHME8,"My review of the film is presented in two pieces: 1) a review of the film as an artistic piece of entertainment & 2) a brief review of the scientific and theological ideas presented.

First off, the film is decent but not great. The premise & story are interesting, but the film works a little too hard to promote its agenda and feels slightly ""forced"" at times. The screenplay dialogue is not particurlary sharp, and the acting performances suffer slightly for this. Also, the romance between the main characters is very formulaic and fails to ooze with chemistry. As this was a ""chaste"" relationship, it would have been nice to see them connect on a deeper non-sexual level, but it just never completely came across on-screen, so their eventual kiss at the end of the film was rather anti-climactic. The sets and production values were decent, particularly for an independent Christian film. Supporting performances by Academy Award winners Ernest Borgnine & Louise Fletcher were excellent. The directing, editing, and cinematography were all adequate, but not exceptional. Overall, the story and ideas are interesting, but their translation to the screen came off as flat at times.

Second, I would like to briefly examine the science and theological ideas presented in the film. Genesis Code offers the proposition that secular science and the Bible are in agreement. They further conclude that the literal 6 days of creation and the 15+ billion years promoted by evolutionists are both simultaneously correct. In a 20+ minute scene that seemingly brings the movie to a complete halt, the scientific treatise is offered: By applying General Relativity to the resulting matter distribution, and claims that gravitational time dilation causes time to pass more quickly the further you are from the center of the universe; Thus, two clocks are actually being used to measure time on earth. In Genesis chapter 1, we are using God's clock, and from His vantage point in the universe, only six days passed during creation. From our vantage point and place in the universe, billions of years are passing (this is a gross oversimpliflication). The scientific ideas presented in the film are based on SOME widely accepted concepts. HOWEVER; many scietific researchers have serious issues with the hypothetical physical universe created here. Dr. Russ Humphreys has become the most notable ""young earth"" scientist to embrace these concepts. His writing and research over the past two decades has been groundbreaking, but has also received sharp criticism within the academic community. Here is a link to one of his videos:

http://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Time-D-Russell-Humphreys/dp/0974864935/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1339138400&sr=1-1

There is one deep theological problem with the ideas presented here, and this is it:

If you have animal life existing on earth for billions of years prior to the fall of Adam in Genesis 2; then you necessarily must have death and dying prior to Adam's fall. This causes numerous hermeneutical issues which are not addressed in the film.

In closing, I would recommend this film to mature Christians as it is provides adequate family entertainment and raises some interesting questions about the Genesis acount in chapter 1. I would not recommend this as an evangelical tool to reach non-Christians as the theology is problematic & confusing.",1339113600,3,3379,5.318352059925093

The movie tries to ""explain"" or reconcile how 6 days here on earth could be equivalent to ""millions of years"" from another reference point.  To me that would infer that ""evolution"" took place in our 6 literal days of creation here on earth.  It's the worst logic of both ""sides"" of the debate.  Things just don't evolve; they adapt, they mutate, they change, they're genetically enhanced through selective breeding.  There's a big difference.

They leave out some very important issues that make their approach impossible. For example, Biblically, there was no death until sin entered the world by Adam and Eve's disobedience.

The science discussed is really interesting and sheds light on the
new earth, old earth perspective.
One thing could have been added to make their point, and that is a
proper translation of the first sentences in Genesis.  Since that
was not done I will do that here as it sheds light on the subject.
Genesis starts out with
""In the beginning"" what is implicated is time, thus ""In the beginning
when time began"".
God ""Elohim"" a plural noun that would identify, The Father, The son,
and The Holy Spirit"".
The word created in the original is ""bara"" which means to bring into
existence something that did not exist prior.
The sentence ""the earth was without form and void"" is a terrible
translation of the original which is Hayaw tohu va bohu.
Hayaw is normally translated became, to become, or was.  Tohu va bohu
is properly translated waste, wasteland, desolate, desolation.
Properly translated ""In the beginning when time began Gods created
the heavens and the earth.  And the earth became a wasteland and
desolate place.
In other scripture you can find out why the earth became a waste
and desolation,a good place to look is in the prophets.  A hint for
you is Lucifer the star of the morning had already rebelled against
God,  when he declared he would ascend into the north parts, exhault his
throne above God's throne, and he would become the most high god.
Satan was already in the garden of eden when God placed the first two
humans there.
Yes I believe the universe to be billions of years old as is the planet
earth, however human life appeared suddendly about 6000 years ago when God
decided to create the human race ""In Our image, after Our likeness""",1338249600,5,1729,4.693069306930693
5062629,5,B0077PHME8,"One of the biggest drawbacks of faith based movies in my opinion is that they usually have stilted if not outright bad acting and the storyline is just cheesy. Well, much to my great delight, The Genesis Code didn't even have an ounce of cheese in it. The acting is top notch as well.

When we meet Blake we are brought in to the midst of a personal struggle of faith. He has gone through the loss of his father and is watching his mother slowly die of pancreatic cancer. Because of these circumstances he has decided that he doesn't believe in a loving God that the Bible talks about. I believe he said it is just a book of fables.

Kerry is the heroine in the story. She is tenacious at wearing down the barriers that Blake has constructed around himself and his beliefs. Who wouldn't be proud to have Kerry as their daughter? Don't get me wrong Kerry also has her struggles but she diligently pursues the answers to what God would have her do.

The Wells family is a wonderful example of what we as Christians should be. Kerry's brother Marc has an amazingly scientific mind that puts him at odds with what the Bible teaches. I absolutely loved the way that the movie showed the family embrace Marc as one of their own while still gently guiding him towards the truth.

Without giving anything away, I must say that Marc's presentation on how science and the Bible can both be right was powerful. In fact it was so powerful that I just had to go back and watch it again.

My favorite line of the movie is, ""If we are patient science will eventually catch up with the Bible."" This movie has the potential to offend many, but it also has the potential of bringing about a lot of thought provoking debate.

I would recommend this movie for junior high and up. There is nothing objectionable for those that are younger; I just don't think the subject matter would hold their attention. I look forward to more movies being put out by American Epic Entertainment.

5062630,4,B0077PHME8,"We just watched the movie last night and really enjoyed it. The story is about Blake who is a very good Hockey player and his struggle and journey toward faith in God. His mother is on life support ,bec she has cancer and his grandparents are about to take her off of life support. He meets this girl( Kerry) who also goes to the same college and has to write a report about him. She is a committed Christian. But she also has her own struggles w/ her faith when her Adviser tells her she needs to put her faith in the background if she wants to have a good career( a struggle that is familiar to many Christians going to a secular college.)Her dad is a minister and plays a vital role for both of their lives.( He is portrait in positive light,what doesn't always happen in movies)His son ,Kerry brother, is a science nut and works in a science museum( I think ) but is not that interested in faith to God. Though he makes a discovery, that he and others from the museum present to Kerry, Blake, her dad and a few others, that reconciles Science w/ the Genesis account of the bible. It was very interesting to watch and listen to that part. It was a good presentation and a good idea how to make this idea part of a  movie. I didn't completely understand everything they said, but it had to do w/ the dimension of time.( need to watch it again to understand better)It sounded pretty interesting and is one way to explain science and the bible. But I pretty sure it is not the only way. I believe more in a young earth, so this movie challenges me to dig more into this subject. What was very interesting,was that the order of what was created first and how Science believes the order happened are the same. The main part was that the bible is true. If I believe the earth was created in 6000 years or millions of years is worth to be debated, but not a salvation issue in my opinion as long as it still validates the bible as being true. I think it's a good movie to watch. Even my 9 year old daughter enjoyed it. ( somewhat Spoiler)The ending was pretty powerful and showed God's mercy for Blake who had asked his Hockey team to support him praying for his mom. God can answer weak prayers, that are from a honest heart.

5062634,2,B0077PHME8,"I was interested in Logan Bartholomew, since he was in some of the Love Come Softly series.  This movie started out on the wrong foot in the very beginning, when Blake (Logan's character) asked Kerry (Sanders) how her sex life was.  He explained that he has never met a pure girl before.  She was attempting an interview with him for a magazine article.  When Kerry meets Blake's buddies later that same day in the bar, for the first time, they tell her that he has many girls.  Whenever Kerry meets Logan, it is frequently in a bar.  As they got to know each other, they met other places.  The behavior of Logan's buddies was quite wild in the first bar scene, like they were trying to show off to Kerry and her two friends.  I liked Sanders and Bartholomew very much, but the storyline was weak and seemed to try to attract a college age audience.  Christians would not meet non-Christians in a bar, if they had a choice of meeting places, it would have been at a coffee shop or a restaurant.

The explanation of how science and the Bible agree and differ was quite drawn out, not to say it wasn't interesting.  Kerry speaks out in class when her science teacher tries to explain everything with evolution and this witnessing-type of responses that she gives the teacher seems to annoy him and the guidance counselor.  The professor turns off her comments with humor, trying to show that she's always defending that creation is correct and evolution is not.  Her guidance counselor has a lengthy chat with Kerry trying aggressively persuade her to abandon her Christian beliefs, especially her belief that God created the world.  The guidance counselor makes a visit to Kerry's dad (a minister)at his church office.  He brings up a perverse subject that I would never mention with my children or to anyone for that matter, I found this quite offensive.  Why in the world would the producers of this movie think that that subject ought to be mentioned, did they think children would not watch this film?  I didn't want my children asking me what that topic was.  The movie went in the trash and I wasted my money.  I did like the main characters.  I found it interesting that Kerry's science professor and her dad were good friends, despite their differences in beliefs.  That was cool!

Overall, I'd say the movie was weakened with too many bar scenes, sexual references, and a huge inappropriate discussion.  Why would Kerry have anything to do further with a guy who asked her how her sex life was?  Why didn't Kerry stand up to her guidance counselor, when the woman was really over-asserting her position as an evolutionist, anti-creationist.  Kerry was quite passive with the guidance counselor.  I found myself saying, ""Say something!  Defend your Christian belief in creation!""  Kerry just sat there.  The movie ends with Kerry and Bartholomew falling for each other, but that's farfetched.  Blake was a very immoral guy, Kerry a Christian.  It should have taken several years in real life to build trust between them and for her to see a changed character in him, before she could accept him as a boyfriend to be a potential husband someday.  I thought it was unrealistic in that sense.  In Blake's defense, he does come to a deeper understanding of God and how He is powerful and answers prayer, but that wouldn't convince me that he had suddenly become a moral person and would stop using alchol.  I'd look at another movie.  The inappropriate content in this movie is why it was rated PG.  I should have not bought it anyway.",1337731200,2,3538,4.686688311688312
5062635,3,B0077PHME8,"The story shows the conflict Christians college students often face- how to respond to those who think Christians reject science and just blindly believe the ""fairy tale"" story of the creation in the book of Genesis.  The conflict is real, many assumptions about Christians are not.  There is an attempted scientific (very long) explanation given in the film as to how both the idea of creation involving evolution and millions of years can be reconciled with a six day belief in creation.  Just use time dialation and, voila, everyone now agrees, the students and teachers are now reconciled in belief, and everyone is happy.  The problem is that in reality that explanation can't resolve the conflict. There are bigger issues than just the time it took for the world we know to come about.  According to the Bible, death and evil entered the world as a consequence of Adam and Eve's sin against God.  That is the whole point of the Bible message of God providing a saviour.  If, as the movie's explanation says, evolution was true, then death entered before Adam and Eve showed up and therefore wasn't a consequence of sin and thus there's no need for a saviour to conquer sin and death.  There are several inconsistencies of thought elsewhere throughout the film.  There were a few insightful elements in the film that demonstrate the nature of mankind.  The film was valuable as a discussion of logical thought processes and how they are often violated. I do appreciate though the attempt to portray Christians as thoughtful, intelligent people.

My wife and I watched this (well, she fell asleep during the scientific review of creation and time continuum) and I had a sort of difficult time following this because it was so intense and professorial in its explanation.  I think they should have used two or even three different kids and an adult to make it more followable.  It seemed like it went for 20-30 minutes but it must have been less.

Anyway, the movie was well acted and flowed fairly well.  I have found ""Christian"" movies have a tendency to dray a little some maybe in time they will figure it out and run with Hollywood.  We just need to make these so much better than they are that it becomes obvious soon after the first 20 minutes into it.

5062637,3,B0077PHME8,"A friend of ours suggested we watch this movie which we did for the first time last night. Our first impression was this is a long movie; at 2 hours and 18 minutes it seemed like it was lasting a really long time. The movie had some interesting moments and attempted to portray some of the lighter side of being in school.

The major thrust of the story is an effort to reconcile Biblical creation and Cosmological ""science."" I put science in quotes as there seems to be some debate among scientists whether cosmology should even be classified as a science. James E. Gunn, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Astronomy at Princeton University is quoted saying, ""Cosmology may look like a science, but it isn't a science. A basic tenet of science is that you can do repeatable experiments, and you can't do that in cosmology.""

It has often been pointed out that creation is a non-repeatable event impossible to duplicate; therefore conclusions concerning the validity of any theory of creation must be confirmed from the available evidence. I am of the opinion the available evidence better supports the Biblical account of creation and in the case of the earth specifically, the impact of the flood as the cause of earth's geology as we see it today. I fully realize the polarizing nature of this comment but stand by my belief that the Biblical account is the true account.

I share the concern of other reviewers speaking from a Christian perspective that this movie may be more confusing than enlightening for those seeking the truth concerning creation. I have no problem with any of the first six chapters of Genesis and believe the revelation contained in those chapters is true and have no need of any sort of compromise with cosmology. God created the heavens and the earth in six literal days and that is the beginning and the end of the matter.

We also learn from the Bible that this entire universe is to be destroyed and replaced with a new heaven and a new earth and this will be done while we wait and I'm very much inclined to believe we won't have to wait long.",1337212800,6,2075,4.630434782608695

5062648,3,B0077PHME8,"There is a great review from Creation ministries. [...]

Here's a good excerpt from the review:

""The Genesis Code ignores the obvious points of conflict between the secular and biblical account of creation. To assume that Genesis is only about six days is vastly incomplete. There are key events within each day which are recorded. It is these events that the Genesis Code also dramatically changes. The biblical account is an orderly record of created matter, light, and life forms without any death, disease and suffering--which contradicts the secular order in which things came to be. The Bible clearly portrays a creation where all creatures including humanity were in harmony with each other and with God. Then, at the sin of Adam, recorded in Genesis 3, sin and death plagued the previously good creation.""

Wish I would have read this review before I bought the movie. The movie was well made, they did a good job with it, it just isn't true. I do believe that the Bible can be supported scientifically, but to compare scientific theory against the inerrant Word of God, and treat scientific theory as absolute truth ""creates"" a major problem for the movie. (pun intended ;)",1336867200,4,1183,4.905
5062649,5,B0077PHME8,"Can science and faith really work together or does someone that wants to pursue a career in science have to let go of their faith to truly be a part of the science industry. This is only one part of the story itself, but it was a poignant one. Overall the movie is a wonderful family movie that allows you to see God and the way that God works in all of our lives. Whether you are a person that current believes in God or not, this is a movie that you will still appreciate! The movie also brings up so many conversation points. My wife and I had many conversations after watching the movie the first time, and the second time we had even further questions that we didn't have at first. This was a great movie that I would highly recommend!",1336867200,4,740,4.181818181818182
5062650,1,B0077PHME8,More trash on why science is wrong and education discriminates against people with preconceived ideas about creation. A movie that days the world hates Christians because they push their obnoxious worldview.,1336521600,3,207,5.709677419354839
5062651,5,B0077PHME8,"If you've ever had a hard time reconciling your belief in the biblical creation story and the undisputable fact that at some point before Adam dinosaurs roamed the earth this movie is for you.  Maybe you've told yourself ""God could have created the earth with dinosaur bones in it"" or maybe you've just pushed the whole issue to the back of your mind and thought ""real faith doesn't question the bible"".  If you have, this movie is for you!  The Genesis Code provides an answer that allows your faith and science to exist side by side without either marginalizing the other.

A few other things I loved about the movie. A minister who shoots a gun!  An athlete who can sing lights out!  A budding relationship between 2 college students that actually seems authentic and doesn't involve them getting involved physically before getting involved emotionally!

Great movie!",1336435200,5,870,4.877551020408164
5062652,5,B0077PHME8,"I have watched this movie many times, as well as my 16yr old daughter & 20yr old son! It gives you new ideas about how faith & science CAN work together, I wasn't sure if a 2hr movie could hold my interest but the 2hrs flew by! I found this movie SO helpful to my son's struggle with faith & science, I SHOULD say HE found it helpful!! Which helps me with our discussions! Also, my daughter's friends age range 15-18 yrs old who don't go to church & are still deciding on ""faith & church"" if they believe in God etc ALL of them LOVED the movie & they pass it back & forth between friends! All saying they loved it, & didn't feel like the movie was trying to force religion or faith on them that they just really love the movie & many have said after watching it, they loved the debates they had! I give this 1 5 stars! Happy it's now on DVD!!",1336176000,4,842,4.017857142857143
5062653,4,B0077PHME8,"""You seem like an intelligent girl, you don't really believe in that religious hokey-pokey do you?"" Blake (Bartholomew) is the star hockey player at his college and is the subject of Kerry's (Sanders) new article. What begins as a simple interview turns into something much much more. Blake's mother is in the hospital and when Kerry mentions prayer she finds out Blake's stance on religion. She turns to her brother in an attempt to prove God is real. I again need to start by saying that I am not a big fan of faith based movies. It's not that I'm not religious it's just that 99% of them are way too cheesy and unbelievable. This one is easily the best one that I have seen. It doesn't force it down your throat but maintains the religious feel through out which is hard to do. JFK is one of my favorite movies for many reasons, but at it's core it is Oliver Stone letting everyone know how he felt. I bring that up because this movie seems like the writers way of letting everyone know how he feels about the religious vs science debate. While there is some hockey scenes in this (which really aren't needed) the meat of the movie takes place in a museum in what is about a half hour of how science can prove the Book Of Genesis is true. As boring as that sounds that scene is the most riveting part of the movie as well as the most exciting lecture I've ever been a part of. Religious or not this is a good movie, but like all faith movies the ending is a little unbelievable which takes a little away from it but still very much worth seeing. Overall, the best of this type of movie I have seen. I give it a B+.",1336089600,37,1617,4.236245954692556
5062654,2,B0077PHME8,"I read with great interest all the reviews giving credit to everyone who added to the discussion.

However, I noticed within the discussions that this Movie on DVD shows the value of the Movie as allowing for the Biblical account was for some viewers an answer to the ""scientific account"" the possibility that the two divergent accounts were not necessarily in discord with each other but rather could live in harmony. Modern science basically explaining HOW God accomplished his work and therefore both accounts may not necessarily be in adversity with each others account.

A true Christian who is knowledgeable in the Word of God, the Bible, either the original Roman Catholic Vulgate of approximately 600 a.d. as well the the next great studious work the 1611 King James Protestant version (the 1611 KJV used the original Vulgate as a ""help"" in bringing to us the KJV)...most people are not aware the KJV was somewhat based on the Roman Catholic Vulgate and if you tell some people that they become very upset, especially Baptists.....I am a Baptist who can accept the facts and disagree with other Baptists who disagree that the Vulgate was used to solve problems for the KJV writers.

Now, having said the above, their is one big difference between the RC Vulgate and the KJV:  the RC Vulgate has many more books included which we Protestants cannot accept as part of the ""Canon"" of hold scripture...I would hope that Roman Catholics and Protestants both explore the extra books of the Vulgate to see why the KJV linguistic interpreters of 1611 could not accept the ""extra"" books of the Vulgate.

In the KJV all but two of the KJV books, both Old and New Testament refer in some way to each other; in my opinion and the opinion of probably the largest part of Protestants this is the largest problem with acceptance of each others interpretation.  That said, to each his or her own faith...this is the United States where we are supposed to have freedom of religion.  Unfortunately there are always some that will insist that their's is the only way.

It is incumbant on each human to distinguish which is the correct version with advice from others of their own choosing without pressure applied...this is the great hope of citizens of the U.S.; freedom!!!

Having said that the big problem is really this:  Does the movie TRULY depict the thesis that NOW, all the sudden theological studies are now in agreement with currant scientific studies?

I have not seen the movie yet and have ordered pre-release copy from Amazon to see for myself and will update this post when I have studied the movie in great depth.  I must say, though, I have never seen anything written that the professors of the colleges (there are a few exceptions)will ever agree that their ""scientific facts"" disprove the Biblical account.  Seems someone is pushing in vain to ""marry the two"" without careful examination which will lead many astray of the truth.

When I have seen the film I will update this post.

For those with a true commitment to finding the truth from Biblical and Scientific study you can go to someone on the web who has already done so: [...]  The Institute for Creation Research [...] (has been around a very long time and has done extremely deep studies in discovering how God created everything man has any knowledge of.

UPDATE:  I have now seen the movie and as suspected found it is merely a ""excitement book"" to ""help"" ALMIGHTY GOD BUILD the Worlds, Galaxy's and everything therein!!!!!

ALMIGHTY GOD does not now, nor has HE ever needed the help of puny mankind!",1335744000,3,3573,4.771103896103896

8512007,1,B0077PHME8,The Reverend misquotes the Genesis chapter 1. The main character doesn't use the best argument that could be used in a science classroom. The biology or paleontology teacher lies about the beliefs of billions of people who are skeptical of Evolutionism. The movie accuses God of being too stupid to communicate clearly in a way that would be understood by humans or too immoral to communicate clearly to the readers of his words (The Book of Genesis).
