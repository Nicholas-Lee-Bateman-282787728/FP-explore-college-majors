2877636,2,B000RZIGYK,"My kids and I absolutely love the Wayside School books for their highly entertaining stories and for the joyfully clever ways they play with language and storytelling.  Unfortunately, very little of that comes through to the movie.  Sure, the movie fits in LOTS of elements from the books, but many of them are introduced inexplicably and have little role in the story.  What's missing is the zany logic that makes the books so charming.  If you know the books, you may enjoy the references, but the movie itself ends up being pretty standard cartoon slapstick.  My five-year-old still enjoys watching it, but I was disappointed that the special intelligence and heart of Wayside School has mostly been lost.",1231027200,24,708,4.966101694915254

8203456,4,B000RZIGYK,"My son liked this movie.  He's read the series of Wayside books by Louis Sachar and enjoyed seeing some of the characters.  He kind of expected it to be just like one of the books, and it wasn't.  Some characters were the same, but the story was different.",1259971200,3,256,4.291666666666667
