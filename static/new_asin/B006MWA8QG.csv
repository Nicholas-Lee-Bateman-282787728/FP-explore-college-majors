5006906,5,B006MWA8QG,the product was in good condition when i got it. The details need to be more detailed then what you have on the web site. overall it was a good buy!,1336176000,,148,3.806451612903226
5006907,4,B006MWA8QG,The collection was awesome. Watched it in just a few days. My only problem was that the entire collection was about crocodile. Wish it had a lil more to it,1334275200,,155,4.2
5006908,5,B006MWA8QG,"While yes these episodes are already out in the Voyages and there is no new content to this set. what sets this apart is the fact that there are 26 episodes in the box instead of 13 like the Voyage box set. plus the Voyages are about 40 dollars and this is 20. so more episodes for half the price!!!!!! and if your like me who LOVES One Piece but couldn't justify buying the voyages because you rather not live on a Ramen Noodle diet then this is for you!

these episodes start in the middle of the Albasta story arc and go all the way to it's conclusion.

Can't wait for the next set to come out!",1334275200,,597,4.0508474576271185
5006909,5,B006MWA8QG,"This set is dominated by the attempt of Princess Vivi Nefertari to prevent civil war and the usurpation by the utterly self centered evil of Crocodile. Will Vivi stop the war in time? And more importantly, will Luffy get his rampaging desire (no, not the one about becomming king of the pirates. That can wait a bit.)of kicking Crocodile's evil butt for a field goal?",1332028800,,367,4.661538461538462
5006910,5,B006MWA8QG,"This set of 4 discs gives the run of Season 4 episodes
104 -- ""Luffy vs. Vivi! The Tearful Vow to ..."" to
130 -- ""Scent of Danger! The Seventh Member is ...""

This ends the Baroque Works / Alabasta storyline started back in episode 65.  One story arc, 66 episodes. That's a record for me.  Also, episodes 110 to 126 span the course of a half an hour.

Still, I liked it.  I preferred the amount of ground covered in episodes 1-64 with many story arcs over the single story arc in episodes 65-130.  Most of the episodes are very character-centric, with all of them getting at least two or three episodes to themselves.  Each in the series of long fights is inventive and clever, with great dialog throughout.  For example, for episode 117, a flashback reveals that Nami asked Usop for some sort of great weapon that could help her to hold up as a fighter with the rest of the crew. Usop gives her a staff that will also be fun at parties. Out of the flashback, Nami has the staff, and she's desperately trying to read the instructions while a spike-powered assassin tries to kill her. She keeps getting the party tricks the staff can do.

I liked at least one thing in every episode, and often more than that.  I'll stay with the series.  Collection Six looks like it will have some shorter, self-contained arcs, which will be a relief after the Alabasta monster.

If you liked collections One-Three, then you'll like the collection Four-Five arc.  Recommended.",1331683200,5,1460,4.526717557251908
5006911,5,B006MWA8QG,"Such a great arc, Arabasta is where one piece really comes out of it's shell and becomes one of the greatest anime around.

As a fan of the series i'm quite annoyed at funimation's changing of their release style mid cycle.  I was following the normal releases, and have both season 1 & season 2 already.  If you're like me and wanting to make the switch to these collections but already have season 1 & 2.  Buy Season 3 First voyage which ends with episode 156.  Then wait for collection 7 to come out which starts with episode 157.",1331078400,4,533,4.343434343434343
5006912,5,B006MWA8QG,Price will drop a few weeks before the release. 30 bucks is the retail price in stores but amazon sells it cheaper when its released and sometimes they raise the price. I own all of the Collections so far. Dont regret a single purchase. Simply a must have. Always buy them on release date so I can get them for 20 bucks. Im a happy camper with these dvds. 24 episodes released every 1-2 months. Going to have a lot of episodes within one year if this keeps up =D Thank you Funimation,1329609600,28,483,4.204301075268817

5006963,5,B006MWA8QG,"There are no words to describe this show except for Epic.  At first I thought this show was going to be a silly kid's show with not the best animation style.  After thinking this for many years, and mocking it for the always remembered 4kids version, I decided to take on the beast of an anime with 500+ episodes.  Best decision I have ever made.  It starts of really rocky at first, but once you reach Arlong park, the necessity to keep going urges you on.  After entering the grand line the story just gets better and better.  As the straw hat pirate's ship grows in experience and crew mates, my interest continues to grow.  Once I reached Water 7 there was no going back.  The story line that the author/mangaka, Eiichiro Oda, created is the most incredible tale I have ever heard.  Not only does the world make you forget all about your own, but the story and characters make you want to leave reality and join the Mugiwara (strawhat) crew.  No show or anime has ever made me feel this or at least to this extent.  I have now rewatched the whole show two times all the way through and have dragged a lot of my friends into this addictive tale.  They would have it no other way.  Oda is a master at story telling to the point where I was crying with every character and even over the loss of a certain ""nakama"" I never thought I would cry over.  The only other word is Brilliance.  Sheer Brilliance.  This show is my favorite anime of all time. I would say it is also in my favorite top 3 stories of all time, if not top 2. :)  Thank you for your brilliance, Oda, and for caring about us over here, Funimation. :)",1377129600,,1617,4.249180327868852

5006968,5,B006MWA8QG,This show is amazing plain and simple. If your a fan of anime or pirates then you owe it to yourself to watch this show.

Instead of battling an enemy at a time, the Straw Hats are involved in a full on war! It's incredible!

 This anime is incredible. It's got action, comedy, adventure, and suspense. The voice actors are all familiar to just about any casual or serious anime fan. This anime also has a lot of Dragonball-like fun in it. It's tons of fun to watch and keeps you wanting to know what happens next.

8501222,2,B006MWA8QG,"Alabasta--- arghhh--- I was really hoping Crocodile would wipe this sucky kingdom and its annoying people of the map, and yes I am including the incredibly annoying Princess Vivi and her do nothing dad. So much filler, so much crap. My advice skip this. The only good parts are the fights at the end and then you still get an hour of Princess Vivi!! Unless she has some major part in the end-game of this series then most of this is a waste.",1480809600,,441,4.325301204819277
