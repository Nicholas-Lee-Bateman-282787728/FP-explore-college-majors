8420709,5,B004AR4VVI,"The Calling follows seven people on their jorneys to become a part of the clergy.  What you see in the stories are real people struggling with lives that are not perfect.  There is the single mother who is trying to balance providing care for her young son and her yearning to preach.  The stories are compelling, and they don't have fairy tale endings.  Good for anyone who is interested in ministry as a career, but it is also good for laity to understand the forces that drive people to ministry.",1364947200,,499,4.511111111111111
