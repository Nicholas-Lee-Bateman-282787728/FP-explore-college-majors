8152202,5,B000JMK6MG,Loved this series! I very much regret selling my season complete collection for $10 in a yard sale years ago. I had to pay almost $10 per volume to get the season collection back. I hate how distributors stop making a product and make it in demand. Older anime has pretty much died. I tried very hard to find the complete series but only found it used for $99~. Since this review is general and is meant for all volumes avoid the volumes that are over $10. They are trying to rip you off. Shop smart and you can buy all the volumes for under $50. It might not all be from Amazon though.,1422576000,,586,4.149122807017544
8152203,5,B000JMK6MG,"My-Hime is one of those animes that you come across usually by accident. When that happened to me I thought, ""where the heck have they been hiding this one all these years?"" It's great. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't too bad either. What gives this series 5 stars is the story. It has very good characters and character development. You get attached to them very quickly and feel for them when the tragedies strike. Believe me there is a lot of tragedy in this story. It's technically a mecha anime I guess, but it's not conventional. The mecha aren't giant humanoid robots, nor are they the focus of the story the mecha are actually summoned by the Hime (princesses) to fight the demons that are after the ones they love. The demons are only a precursor to a giant plot that is very sinister and dark. While only one Hime can survive you won't want to let go of any of them. They are mostly just average girls with people they want to protect.

This anime is great. It has a good mixture of emotion and action. You should definitely check it out.",1354752000,,1072,4.414141414141414
8152204,5,B000JMK6MG,"a wonderous opera that will help you understand love even if you thought you already did. I recommend everyone that has a passion for anime to see this and also those that don't too, and if someone would make a live action movie to this story it would be something great (no changing the story-line for ratings, etc.)",1336780800,,317,4.482758620689655
8152205,5,B000JMK6MG,"I rented the first volume after it came out - to try and see some RECENT Anime for once! - and was stunned by how detailed the story was paced and how the characters slowly developed. Personally I like slow-moving Anime (so long as it's going somewhere or delves deeper into character personalities) - I don't know why. It has something to do with the emotional impact Anime has on me, I suppose. I can watch Anime over and over and over again and still enjoy it as much as my first viewing (I've seen Gilgamesh, Full Metal Alchemist, Initial D, and Azumanga Daioh at least five times through. They're about as different as as you can get, but they all have that emotional grab.)

This series is phenomenal, and though there are only 3 episodes in this volume, a LOT happens in it. I cannot wait for the finale - but I'm sure I'll get a couple more viewings out of this set of episodes before I get to it though! Thanks to My Hime and other great series like Planetes, Eureka Seven, and Mars Daybreak, Bandai is becoming one of my favorite Anime companies (along with ADV and Funimation). If you've been wanting some Anime that you can sit back and relax to, think about, and become emotionally involved with - and haven't seen any My Hime yet - get Volume One and judge for yourself.

One side note - though I almost always watch Anime in Japanese with the subtitles, the English voicework is more than adequate in this and all other Bandai series - which is surprising to me. Most English dubbing I've seen is terrible due to amateurish voicework or the culture just doesn't translate correctly. Plus I always felt that English dubbing was rather insulting to the genre thanks to the removal of ALL Asian accent - but thanks to Bandia's professional dubbing, I've been able to enjoy BOTH versions - because there's really two different stories, due to having to change some of the script to fit the animated mouths drawn to speak in Japanese. (It's subtle - but anyone who's seen dubbed and subtitled versions of an Anime series knows what I mean! Just try to see the dubbed version FIRST - the difference is more noticeable then.)

Also - the artwork on the boxes is really eye-catching. I've seen a lot of other Anime covers that have more interesting and beautiful pictures on the cover, but the My Hime covers really stand out in my collection. It must have something to do with the soft-colors, which is more pleasant to my brain than the really bright screaming colors that are so popular nowadays to try and get yout attention at the store. Bandai uses the same soft coloring for their series Scrapped Princess (which I've yet to see) and Planetes. It's a pretty good marketing technique if you ask me.",1173312000,,2711,4.539877300613497
8152206,4,B000JMK6MG,"thought this was the last dvd, guess i was wrong.  does amazon even know that there's gonna be a 7th disc?  disc 6 was on preorder before 4 even came out.  it's not that much of a rip off though, full metal panic tsr is getting 3 eps to a disc as well.

it definitely raises up a lot more questions leading up to the 7th disc, which is going to be amazing.",1168819200,3,356,3.835616438356164
8152207,1,B000JMK6MG,"..., but we're really getting raped here. Was it 100% necessary to put out 2 DVDs (#6 and soon #7) with only 3 episodes each? Couldn't this DVD just as easily had the final 6 episodes?

Marketing like this is a slap in the face to people who loyally support series (and the companies) by buying DVDs, instead of buying pirated Chinese box sets or boosting illegal fansubs.",1168560000,3,372,4.470588235294118
8152208,4,B000JMK6MG,"This volume of Mai Hime is definitely my favorite so far.  There's tons of action, some really nice plot twists and drama to go along with it.  I won't give out any spoilers but if you have been watching Mai Hime and have been a bit bored or hesitant to continue watching this set of episodes really comes through on what we've all been waiting for.  My only gripe is that it has taken the series this long to reach its potential but I'm glad I stuck with it.",1167868800,5,459,4.134831460674158
