3718317,5,B001NG42DQ,"This looks as good or better than when I saw this in HD on PBS. Maybe even better than the three times I actually visited Ireland. ;-)

I would have liked to see more significant sites, but it is only 60 minutes long.",1245801600,20,217,4.046511627906977
3718318,5,B001NG42DQ,I loved feeling like you were flying over the country since I had never decided to take a trip like that before. Now I want to take the plane excursion when I visit Ireland. So beautiful!,1408924800,,187,4.222222222222222

3718321,5,B001NG42DQ,"I've only been to Ireland at night, when military flights that I've been on have re-fueled at Shannon.  My ancestry is Irish, and I do intend to take a trip there someday, w/ my wife.

The low over-flight photography in this DVD is spectacular, and the idea is well-suited for such a scenic place.",1399420800,,297,4.481481481481482
3718322,3,B001NG42DQ,"It was a bit quick for me.  I wanted a different angle on some of the ruins, but the filming finger, having filmed, moved on . . .  pronto.  The narrative was also pretty ""grandma"" bland.  People under 50 enjoy these things, too.",1397174400,,229,4.255813953488372
3718323,4,B001NG42DQ,Well this DVD was actually a Christmas gift for my brother who will be visiting Ireland next year ! I asked him how he would rate the DVD and he said it was very beautiful and made him want to visit Ireland even more !,1388880000,,218,3.8666666666666667

3718327,5,B001NG42DQ,"We got to watch ""Over Ireland"" on PBS one day and abslutely loved it.  I have always wanted to go to Ireland and have an Irish heritage.  My brother was able to go a few years ago.  He just passed away three days after Christmas.  He LOVED Ireland so much; was into history and was planning on going back some day for another visit.  He had seen ""Over Ireland"" and thought it was awesome, too.  I particulary LOVE the song at the end ""I Will"".  It is the most beautiful song I have ever heard.  I wish there was a cd available with that song and others on it by the same artist.  But I believe that song was an original song written for this DVD.  I can't find any CD's by that artist.  Anyway, I purchased this DVD in order to feel closer to my late brother.  This DVD is well done and will be the closest I will ever get to Ireland.",1360454400,5,834,4.0182926829268295
3718328,5,B001NG42DQ,Another great Ireland DVD. Ever wanted to go to Ireland and couldn't? This is the solution for you. Sit back and relax as you enjoy this informative and beautiful DVD. A must have for the Ireland enthusiast.,1358208000,,207,4.621621621621622
3718329,1,B001NG42DQ,"I am not sure what I was expecting, but I was disappointed overall.  The aerial photography was good.....that which you could see without a blur.  I sense there was a need to cram too much into too short a time frame.

I have been to Ireland several times and actually flew over parts in a private plane.  I had a much better view than what this video presented as the pilot was so high, many things were indistinguishable.  Ergo, many of the ruins and buildings were not captured in their true size.  Add to this, there was little or no dialogue about many of the sights.

I don't like to be critical of people's endeavors, but neither do I like spending money on something I did not enjoy.  I ended up trying the video a 2nd time in bed.  On low volume, I went sounded to sleep listening to the ""New Age"" music.",1354147200,3,813,4.261437908496732
3718330,5,B001NG42DQ,"An excellent presentaion of The Country of Ireland. Educational and informative, especially to me who has Ireland in his Heritage.....Thank you..",1352332800,,145,5.9523809523809526
3718331,5,B001NG42DQ,"The photography is absolutely magnificent. The music in the background is very fitting. I would recommend this to anyone. I have been to Ireland and loved this view ""from the top"".",1351209600,,180,4.838709677419355
3718332,5,B001NG42DQ,The poetic words fill me with a sense of making the trip to IRELAND.  This video embraces the spirit of the country of Ireland.,1344902400,,127,4.291666666666667
3718333,1,B001NG42DQ,"Buyers beware!  I purchased 3 new DVD's and there is a sound problem with the video.  The pictures are beautiful, but the sound breaks up on and off continuously.  Note:  I have a new Blu-Ray player and all of my other DVD's work perfectly.",1343606400,2,240,4.386363636363637
3718334,5,B001NG42DQ,"I read the reviews on the different Ireland video, and decided to buy this one. It is very good, and I recommend it. The concerns I read over the soundtrack being too loud, does not happen on my Blu-ray player, so it is not a disk problem. By the way, the choice of songs for the Soundtrack are excellent, and do not detract from the tour.",1332979200,,339,4.151515151515151
3718335,4,B001NG42DQ,"""Over Ireland"" is a fast-paced tour by helicopter.  Scenes are colorful and show us many interesting places and sights. The views are well planned to make the best use of  light and shadow.  Scenery varies from countryside to city to coastline to mountains to hold ones interest.
 Care has been taken to keep the viewer oriented and in the moment.  Maps highlight the next area to be traveled.  The background music enlivens the journey.  The commentary gives us a sense of the spirit of Ireland and generally covers the scenes provided.  Captions conveniently identify many of the sights.
 A great many scenes are covered very quickly in five to seven second sequences, with a few sequences of greater length.  I prefer to linger a bit and pay more attention to the view however.  The photography is often the better side-view from the helicopter which shows us so much more than the forward view so common in similar videos.  But the helicopter is moving fast so pay attention.  The fast pace seems a bit too hurried.
 For a colorful, fast-paced aerial tour with an interesting commentary backed by some good Irish music, this is the ticket.",1325980800,4,1143,4.794871794871795
3718336,5,B001NG42DQ,Watching this it's such an excellent way to relive our memories from a recent vacation in Ireland. It offers stunning scenery and a nice overview for the main highlights of visiting Ireland.,1307923200,,190,4.96875
3718337,5,B001NG42DQ,"A must see for anyone planning a trip to Ireland or just wanting to know more about this fascinating country.  However, be prepared for the distinct possibility that you're unlikely to experience the same weather conditions as found on the film.  In fact, you may enjoy this even more after a visit to Ireland to get an idea of what was under all those clouds.  Beautiful photography and great narration.",1303257600,2,404,4.742857142857143
3718338,5,B001NG42DQ,"Great chance to get a glimpse of the ""Emerald Isle"" without leaving home.  Arm chair traveling at it's best.  A wonderful DVD for the whole family at an unbelievable low price. Love it! Love the Deals at Amazon!",1303084800,,211,4.526315789473684
3718339,5,B001NG42DQ,"We gave this book as a Christmas gift to an uncle who had recently taken a trip to Ireland. He loved the book, and started flipping through immediately. It has breath taking photos and lots of good reading. We definately recommend!",1295049600,,231,4.658536585365853
3718340,4,B001NG42DQ,"This Blu-ray Disc has wonderful photography and detail. The sound sometimes cuts out on my Samsung Blu-ray player, but not the Sony, so I don't know whether to blame the disc or player. Tthis is an minor annoyance compared with the awesome visuals.

I really learned some things about Ireland from this disk. My only complaint is that segments featuring small towns and smaller cities were too short - I wanted to see more of these communities. I also saw some things that I wished the narrative would have explained - like some tree branch shaped patterns on the surface of the water in one of the lakes.",1294012800,,605,4.601851851851852
3718341,4,B001NG42DQ,"I bought this as part of 4-DVD bundle. I knew Ireland is a beautiful country with a lot of greenery, but didn't expect this much variety. Picture quality, composition, and lighting are fantastic. I will definitely watch this video again and again.

Entire footage is areal. So, even if you visit Ireland, you won't see much of what you see in this video.

However, narration is so boring that one family member dozed off while two began side conversations. I think it would have kept the attention if there was only just music and captions.

I recommend you buy the bundle - much cheaper that way.",1283212800,,597,4.613207547169812
3718342,5,B001NG42DQ,"This was a refreshingly beautiful look of the great Isle of Ireland!  It didn't disappoint at all. We've traveled there and found this DVD provides coverage of the beauty and the diversity of the land. To see aerial views of many familiar sites, gave us breathless thrills. The accompanying music and narrative were superb. Soothing and enjoyable too. We have watched it many times and shared it with friends and family. We'd highly recommend this DVD for its beauty, diversity, cultural information and history.",1279929600,2,512,5.095238095238095
3718343,3,B001NG42DQ,"Scenery - fantastic, what can I say.

Music - At times far too loud and I much prefer natural sounds like
  water, seagulls etc... Music is a choice of the director and
  not always the choice of the viewer!! Would have been better
  without. You have the option to watch the dvd without the
  commentary but not to hear the commentary without the music.

Commentary - Ok but in parts this was totally drowned out by the
  music !!!!! Which was a big, big mistake. I bought this
  as an educational tool for foreign students, however
  I had trouble making out what was being said so they
  would have no chance !! Sorry but the quality of the
  music and commentary was a big disappointment to me.
  I hope the makers read this and take on board my
  constructive criticism. Thank you.",1278460800,18,786,4.373239436619718
3718344,5,B001NG42DQ,"I love travelogues and the ""Over Ireland"" DVD is one of the best.  From the cities like Dublin to the various farm lands the viewer is shown the scenery of Ireland in all its lush green splendor that's sure to impress anybody, Irish or not.  I strong recommend ""Over Ireland"" as it is one of the best in this series.",1274832000,2,316,4.25

3718346,5,B001NG42DQ,"The first time we saw this video was on a friend's computer.  He had the Blue Ray version and it was just awesome.  The colors were the truest colors I've ever seen.  I bought the High Def. version and it's just as beautiful.  Having been to Ireland several times, it brought back many wonderful memories, and we saw many of the places we had been on the dvd.  I very highly recommend it!!",1250899200,27,389,4.273972602739726
3718347,3,B001NG42DQ,"As I also own the three Over America series Movies in BD, so I was looking forward to this one. But Over Ireland while the pictures are stunning and the narative is good, The speed in which the scenery flashes by is too quick. this results in frequent backtracking and pausing just to get a good view of the magnificient sights. If only there was a way to slow the movie down in many places this would have been really great.",1249084800,30,425,4.2592592592592595
