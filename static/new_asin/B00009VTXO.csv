1891609,3,B00009VTXO,"Although it is not the boxed set that is causing all the buzz this 2 DVD set is still good for any Jackass Fan. As stated in an earlier review this trilogy only has bits and peices of the CKY movies mixed. If you have just caught the Viva-LaBam bug and want to know how it all started, this is the trilogy for you. All you hardcore CKY fans should hold out for the BOXED set with ALL the movies in it.",1070236800,15,401,3.902439024390244
1891610,2,B00009VTXO,"Don't get this. Get the original CKY box set from ckystore.com on DVD while you can. Because this set only features CKY, the Documentary, CKY2K & CKY3 mixed together. A lot of scenes are missing from CKY2K and CKY3. Due to law suits and other random stuff, Bam had to re-release the CKY videos and he had to cut out some stuff. So while you can, get these great videos in their intirety at ckystore.com",1066780800,44,402,4.373333333333333
1891611,3,B00009VTXO,"It is good if you aren't that big of a cky fan. It has two disks. The first disk is the greatest, it has the O.G. cky landspeed and the documentary. But then the second disk is not so good. It is a remix of cky2k and cky3, which if you saw the originals you will be very dissapointed seeing the remix. The remix is missing several of the best scenes from these movies, and it made me mad when I bought it. But its ok so buy it if you want. P.S. Haggard is the greatest movie ever, so check it out, especially if you are a big CKY fan.",1066176000,4,534,3.81981981981982
1891612,4,B00009VTXO,"This is a great DVD!  Especially for new fans to catch up with all of their stuff.  The documentary included is great and shows alot of old footage.  all the guys look so young in it!  The only problem i have with the dvd is that cky2 and cky3 are not in their entirety.  cky1 includes everything, but 2 and 3 only have about 8 skits from each of their movies.  i feel cky2k is their best and nothing should be cut from it.  i reccomend picking up this disc, but feel you should also pick up cky2k to see its full version.",1060646400,4,522,4.009708737864078

1891631,2,B00009VTXO,"I thought like another reviewer that the trilogy would be all of the content. My friend had the individual dvds which I thought were great, this is okay. A lot of gross humor, I am more into their stupid prank kind of content, which is included but again not as much as the original dvd's.",1394668800,2,289,4.2727272727272725
1891632,5,B00009VTXO,"These movies kind of came before Jackass came along. They feature many of the same characters though, focusing mostly on Bam and Ryan Dunn's crew. They are even more offensive and outrageous, and therefore even funnier than Jackass in my opinion. Plus, Brandon Dicamillo is one of the funniest dudes out there, and you get more of him in these than in Jackass also. For a long time, this was my go to movie when I needed a good laugh after a hard day. I laugh so hard I cry.",1391299200,,474,4.277777777777778
1891646,5,B00009VTXO,this is a great collection of the cky stuff that preceded jackass which i personally think is too commercial. i mean mtv? really?,1388016000,,129,4.6521739130434785
1891647,2,B00009VTXO,"I WANTED TO WATCH THIS BECAUSE OF RYAN DUNN AND COME TO FIND OUT THEY HARDLY SHOWED HIM, MOSTLY ABOUT SKATEBOARDING AND BAM....SORRY BUT I DIDN'T FEEL THIS DVD AT ALL.",1387152000,,167,4.419354838709677
1891648,3,B00009VTXO,I figured it would be all the dvd's in one but no its not its excerpts from all the dvds so some of my favorite parts weren't on there my advice would be to just buy them seperate..,1358121600,,181,3.789473684210526
1891649,4,B00009VTXO,Love seeing what lead into what everybody now knows as jackass 4 stars only because there was one part of the dvd that skipped which was a manufacturer defect and they could careless when i told them about it,1357430400,,208,4.358974358974359
1891650,3,B00009VTXO,"It's an ok few movies if you like jackass, just lacks polish that those movies have. The skits aren't built up enough and too much skateboarding.",1354406400,,145,4.615384615384615
1891651,4,B00009VTXO,"It has all of the DVDs, and is amazing. Great fr people who enjoy CKY at all. Although the middle disc holder thing in the case was broken. When I opened the case all of the DVDS slid around. They could have easily been scratched and wouldn't stay in place. I had to find another case to put them all in. If you were able to do that, and the DVDS weren't scratched, then enjoy the awesomeness of CKY!",1333497600,,400,4.075949367088608

1891653,3,B00009VTXO,"The only reason I got this was for my collection. If you expect to get all 3 full movies, your wrong. The first disc is the full documentary and the first movie, wich has about 10 minutes cut out. The 2nd disc is just 20 minutes of Cky2k, and 20 minutes of Cky 3, with thier scenes mixed together. I highly recomend getting the movies individualy.",1272672000,,347,4.2727272727272725
1891654,3,B00009VTXO,"CKY 1 is awesome....but I really would have liked to have the complete CKY2K and CKY 3 instead of a remix. Also the documentary...eh at best.

However, the Chinese Rap at the end almost makes it all worth it!",1202860800,,208,4.333333333333333
1891655,1,B00009VTXO,"I cant believe this would be sold and marketed as a trilogy when most of the content of 2 and 3 isn't even in it.  They have been mashed together and all the good content is gone.  Buy the movies individually if you want the full, awsome, cky experiance.",1199577600,3,254,4.163265306122449
1891665,4,B00009VTXO,"Bam and the crew at their finest, but part two and three are combined together and your missing out of a lot of extra stuff. Like Bjork's house and the rental car and many more.",1175212800,,177,4.085714285714285

1891668,4,B00009VTXO,"i have the original cky's at home but they were vhs, and i was uner the assumption that these would be the same but they cut out at least half of the 2nd and 3rd movies... kinda upsetting. they did make it up a lil with some new stuff...",1162771200,2,237,3.857142857142857
1891669,4,B00009VTXO,"i have every cky out (cky, cky2k, cky3, cky4, and the cky documentary). this is actually a great dvd. you get 2 dvds. the first dvd is the first cky (landspeed). some of the stuff got cut. the 1st dvd also also has the ENTIRE documentary. disk2 is the cky2k/cky3 remix. the intro is cky3, then some stuff from cky2k/cky3. this wasn't as good because some of the funny stuff got cut. buy it if you don't want to buy all the ckys",1151107200,2,427,4.156626506024097
1891670,5,B00009VTXO,"Cky is great to watch to see where Bam and his fellow ""dudes"" have come from.  They're stunts on Viva La Bam are great because he has the money for the outrageous.  These are great because he was crazy back then.  And plus you gott love Vito.",1140652800,,242,4.1063829787234045
1891671,5,B00009VTXO,"This is a great double disc DVD. every thing you'd expect from the cky crew. it also has a section on the documentary about the band cky,and how they got together.

if you really want this and if you are expecting to see cky1 the doc, cky 2 and 3 then maybe you should buy cky 2 and 3 seperate b/c it is a remix. The cky 2 and 3 are merged together which is cool, but you will miss some of the other skits they do. if you buy them seperate, you will be able to see aal of the skits.

i think tat the dvd's are great anf every fan should buy them.

1891672,4,B00009VTXO,"CKY (Camp Kill Yourself) is plastered on the hats or shirts of the stars of Jackass and Viva La Bam and for a long time I wondered what that was. Little did I know that it was a series of Jackass like DVDs and VHSs starring Bam and his crew of [...]. And the truth is, though Jackass and Viva La Bam are definately better, CKY isn't that bad. A little dated, maybe, but definately worth a watch. Hell, I'd recommend this set simply for the freestyle at the tailend of the 4th film, done by Brandon DiCamillo to hilarious perfection.",1130112000,,532,4.2772277227722775
1891673,5,B00009VTXO,"but I don't like the way Cky2k & 3 were mixed on this, any way on to the review.

Cky - Great!!! Funny skits like when he goes the through the drive thu & orders a Diet Pepsi, & he gets it, & throws it back in the window & says fire inthe hole!!! Really Good Cky movie.

Cky2k - Probably the best Cky, haha, The best part is where they kick the football at the moving cars, that was funny as hell, I laughed at that part 50 times in a row!!

Cky3 - The chocolate laxitive part is probably the best!! Good, but not as good as 1 & 2k

The documentary - shows some earlier stuff, like how to rob a house, & the play was funny!

Get the box set instead of this though, & get Cky4 too!",1106524800,5,680,3.76056338028169

7993370,5,B00009VTXO,"A lot of people are complaining about it has the original movie and CKY2k and CKY 3 but the downer is its round 2, round 2 is a remix of CKY2k and CKY3 so you will get half of CKY2k and half of CKY3 it's still good. But it has the original that started it all. That's a winner.",1495497600,,277,3.711864406779661

7993373,1,B00009VTXO,This is not all three different movies. 2ky and 3 are just a mash up of both of them. Kind of stupid. I only paid like 3 bucks for it so I guess.,1464220800,2,145,3.4242424242424243
