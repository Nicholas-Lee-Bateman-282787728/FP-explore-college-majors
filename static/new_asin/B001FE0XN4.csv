8302047,2,B001FE0XN4,"I was fairly disappointed with the video quality of this DVD.  The image is sometimes so dark that I pretty much just see black.  I have an old copy of this movie on VHS tape which has much better video quality than this disc.  I bought the disc hoping it would be clearer and to skip all of the commercials.

This must be about third or fourth generation copy from the original print.  Disc 1 also had a problem in my laptop although not my DVD player at home.  One nice thing is that subtitles are available in Chinese or English, although some of the English translation is pretty terrible.",1412640000,,593,4.345454545454546
