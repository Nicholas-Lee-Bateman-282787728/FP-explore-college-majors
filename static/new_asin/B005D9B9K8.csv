I have seen 100s of them in my lifetime, (Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Elton John, Rod Stewart to only name a few), but I honestly have never seen a show to top this one.  I would have given anything to have been able to see it live.  I was not a big fan of Take That or Robbie Williams in the 90's, because living in the US, I didn't know that much about them.  However, I discovered Robbie Williams a few years back and in doing a little research on him, found that I absolutely LOVE him and Take That.  I am now a massive fan and a fan for life.  Bucket List = See Robbie Williams and Take That perform live.  Progress Live - BEST CONCERT EVER!",1358812800,6,717,4.115107913669065
4657571,5,B005D9B9K8,"Have to admit, I'm more of a Robbie fan, than Take That fan - the concert started pretty well with just the 4 of them, but I was blown away when Robbie came on stage - it almost seemed like Take That were his openers.  When all 5 came together, the concert was great, fantastic lighting, dancers, video screens though I did think the concert ended quietly.",1357171200,,356,4.313432835820896
4657572,5,B005D9B9K8,"This performance by Take That includes Robbie Williams on many of the performances, but there is also plenty of Gary, Howard, Mark and Jason too.  Great show captured in Manchester, with an incredible stage production.  Well worth the money!",1355270400,,241,5.153846153846154
4657573,5,B005D9B9K8,"This dvd concert's so awesome, spectacular, fantastic, can't stop to watching this dvd again and again. U should buy this dvd, it's worth to buy, u will never regret it",1342310400,3,168,4.633333333333334
4657574,5,B005D9B9K8,I ENJOYED SO MUCH WATCHING THIS VIDEO. I AM A TOTAL FAN OF TAKE THAT ESPECIALLY GARY BARLOW..THE BLU RAY IS VERY CLEAR AND THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT..,1333324800,,147,4.285714285714286
4657575,4,B005D9B9K8,A very well done video.  It is the next best thing to actually being there.  This video is able to capture the emotion and sounds of the concert.  Well worth adding to your collection especially if you are a Robbie Williams fan.,1325894400,4,228,4.380952380952381

4657578,4,B005D9B9K8,"I'll never understand why Take That did not make it in the US. :(  Thanks to youtube I was able to watch their concerts, music videos, etc, etc. I'm only giving 4 stars because I felt that it was too much footage of Robbie Williams. He no doubt is very talented & is a very good performer. I just think he is a bit full of himself & not humble...like Gary, Mark, Jason & Howard.

I must add that the stage was magnificent!! However, I thought the Beautiful World DVD showed more close-ups. Disc 2, the making of Progress Live was a bit short, unlike the one from the Beautiful World disc 2. Plus, Jason wasn't even in it. Sorry, I don't mean to be so negative.

I still can not get over the HUGE audience!! You will feel like you are at the concert!! Overall, this DVD is very fun to watch. I am sure all fans, old & new alike will thoroughly enjoy it!!!!!!!!!

4657581,5,B005D9B9K8,"The Progress Live DVD is a must have. it started off as 4 members with a couple of songs then they introduce their big surprise to the fans and I love how they did it. And it was the 5th member Robbie Williams and he done a couple of his solo songs and then the second half was just amazing because all 5 members of Take That Gary Barlow, Robbie Williams, Jason Orange, Mark Owens and Howad Donald perform all together it was just an amazing time. The fans went wild and so did I. It was just a Take That and Party good time.",1367193600,,525,4.0095238095238095
4657582,5,B005D9B9K8,"As a Gary Barlow- Take That fan since the early nineties, this DVD is something I couldn't resist adding to my collection.  It was a delight to watch the five perform live.",1365897600,,172,4.375

8466435,5,B005D9B9K8,"Very high quality.  I'm a recent convert to the Take That fan base and have purchased the ""Beautiful World Tour"" DVD as well as this one.  They put on a tremendous show.  Although, in the Robbie Williams set on the Progress tour I kind of expected him to do ""Millennium"" as I thought it was one of his bigger hits.  But, no go.  Good stuff",1505865600,,339,4.153846153846154
8466436,4,B005D9B9K8,"Once they get to section where all 5 of them are performing this show is utterly fantastic.  I felt that both the TT4 opening and Robbie's set, which each featured 5 songs, were rushed.  I completely understand why they broke up the concert this way and I'm not sure they could have done it any differently but it still feels a bit disjointed and rushed until they all come together on stage.",1488412800,,392,4.430555555555555

8466439,5,B005D9B9K8,"I can't stop watching this amazing show, I just wish I could have seen it in person. Hopefully some day soon Take That come do some gigs in the United States. If your a TT fan or just a fan of amazing music this is a must have. Had zero problems with it playing in an American Blu-Ray player.",1443916800,,292,3.9661016949152543
