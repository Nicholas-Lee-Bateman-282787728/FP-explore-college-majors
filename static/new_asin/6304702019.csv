934030,5,6304702019,"This movie simply is one of those that can't be catalogued, can't be reviewed without falling short. Part of Latin America's magical realism made film, this masterpiece by Argentinian Eliseo Subiela, depicts the relationship between Oliverio (a poet who sells his creativity to publicity agencies for money when he's short on cash) and Ana (a prostitute), in Oliverio's quest for the woman who ""can fly"" while making love... This movie will leave you wanting more, and you shouldn't have to wait to long, because its part 2 just came out last year.",1025913600,8,548,4.967391304347826
934031,5,6304702019,"This film is a sublime fusion of poetry, film, and surrealism. I saw it for the first time at a Latin film festival in Atlanta, Georgia and will no doubt immerse myself in it many times in the next few years. A witty and poignant look at our need to love deeply that manages to be intellectual without ever letting the emotions become stale. To Eliseo Subiela, all I can say is ""thank you!""",971827200,4,390,4.283783783783784
934032,5,6304702019,"Nobody could say to have know the love without having seen this film. This film is the crown of the love and it's very important for the symbols that  are in all the film. I must see more times this film to be able to  undertand all the symbols and the messages. There are 2 different way to  see this film: superficial and semiotical. If you see it superficial, you  will like this film but, probabily, you will find stupid some scenes. If  you see it semiotical, you will love it because you will understand the  hidden messages that the master Subiela has hidden in it. My favourite film  of Subiela and not only.",967766400,,616,4.350877192982456
934033,5,6304702019,"Having lived in Argentina, I am biased towards Argentine cinema (some, not all), but even if I weren't, this would still rank up there in my top twenty films of all time. Better even than Eliseo's previous masterpiece  ""Man Facing Southeast"" (a must-see), this film is warm, poetic,  charming, loving, and subtly deep. Like all good ""magical  realism"" movies (a genre Latin American film-makers excel at), this  film is enjoyable both superficially and, even more so, at a second and  third viewing. However, to truly appreciate this film, you need to speak  Spanish. Though still excellent while reading the sub-titles, the poetry is  lost. Rarely has the Argentine ""dialect"" been so beautifully  utilized to convey emotion and character. I think that the end-result may  have surpassed even the director's own expectations. Please, please, please  let it come out on DVD. See it now!",959212800,5,885,5.125874125874126
934034,5,6304702019,"Not only is this my favorite film ever, but I was so obsessed by it that I researched all the amazing poetry in it (by Mario Benedetti, Juan Gelman, and most of all Oliverio Girondo) and went to Argentina.  The film is  inspired by Girondo's book of poetry ""Scarecrow"" (Espantapajaros)  from 1933, but set in contemporary (early 90s) Argentina and Uruguay just  after the end of military rule.  It is a romantic love story, but it is  suffused with a poetic sensitivity, juvenile playfulness, bits of magic realism (reminiscent of  Garcia Marquez or Like Water for Chocolate) and a very moving emotional  pensiveness.  It follows the bohemian life of a poet in Buenos Aires, who  hangs out with his friend a pornographic sculptor, pays for his meals with  poems, converses with Death (personified) and searches for the woman who  can fly.  In Uruguay for work, he meets a prostitute and on subsequent  visits, despite their fears, they fall (and fly) in love.  I have forced  all my friends to see this movie and would recommend this film to anyone,  but most of all romantics or speakers of Spanish.  Subiela is a genius: his  other films ""Man Facing Southeast"" and ""Don't Die Without  Telling Me Where You're Going"" are also very much worth seeing.  There is a sequel, ""The Dark Side of the Heart 2"", made ten years later which is also worth seeing, but not quite as great as the original.",944784000,14,1391,4.6887966804979255
934035,5,6304702019,"Absolutely my favorite movie of all times. The wit! The story! The poetry! Mr. Subiela, I love you for this awesome gift to humanity. Inmejorable.",943488000,5,146,4.88
934036,5,6304702019,El lado oscuro del corazon(Dark Side of the Heart) is one of those unforgetable films in which the art of filmmaking becomes poetry. The poems of the great Uruguayan poet Mario Benedetti are part of some beautiful and  magnificent scenes. In fact Benedetti himself appears in one or two  occations as a drunk German poet. The poem used for the story of this film  is one of  the best known poems of Oliverio Girondo (Argentina). Eliseo  Subiela is one of the finest Directors of our International Cinema.,911692800,6,504,4.747126436781609
934373,5,6304702019,"The first 2 minutes, with the specially designed dating bed, are alone worth the price of admission!

Full of beautiful imagery and poetry and music, much of it brilliantly surreal and metaphorical, albeit a few sophomoric spots here and there when it just seems way too classically Romantic.

And that's why I'd give it 4 instead of 5 stars---this film is indeed very enjoyable, but it doesn't have any real edge of satire or self-mocking playfulness.  It doesn't seem to be aware of its own existence as merely a work of art wrought by human hands, not reality itself.  In that regard it reminds me of the kind of poetry that people often write in their late teens and twenties: heartfelt, passionate, and often moving...but without the lightness and wisdom of a more mature perspective.

Still, it's unique and engrossing enough to be worth owning, in my opinion.",1157760000,6,866,4.824324324324325
934374,4,6304702019,"Most enjoyable.  Though consistently dark, it evokes strong feelings. The poetry is fabulous and the imagery compelling.",1127952000,,120,6.0588235294117645

934376,5,6304702019,"El lado oscuro del corazon (original title) is another great movie from Argentinean director Eliseo Subiela. When I saw this movie a lot of things changed in my life, starting by rejecting most Hollywood-type movies (such a  waste!). Hope we can see some day the full filmography of Eliseo Subiela released.",1080345600,2,307,5.019607843137255
934377,5,6304702019,"El lado oscuro del corazon de Oliverio Girondo se ilumina con el amor y erotismo descubierto en Ana por medio de la poesia dialoguistica a lo largo de la pelicula. La muerte juega un papel importantisimo, en el sentido en que ella (personificada en mujer (Nacha Guevara)) se acerca a Oliverio en los momentos de debilidad poetica, es decir, en momentos en que el poeta no tiene inspiracion para escribir o esta desilusionado del amor, por lo dificil que para el significa ""Amar"", como bien el lo expresa ""Como amar sin poseer, como no amar sin pedir nada a cambio, sin esperar nada a cambio...el amor es una trampa que se le tiende al otro para aduenarse de el, para hacerlo su esclavo (...)"".",1078617600,7,693,4.596774193548387

934379,5,6304702019,"En definitiva creo que es lo mejor de Subiela y una de las mejores pelculas que muestran la combinacin mgica de cinematografa y literatura (la msica tambin es importante).  Para m es el mejor logro del cine latinoamericano y una de las mejores de la historia.  Cada escena puede extraerse como una pequea estrofa de la mejor poesa posible.  Cmprala!
Definetly, i believe this is the best of Subiela and one of the best movies showing the magic combination of cinematography and literature (the music also is important in the movie).  To me is the best achievement of the latinamerican cinematography and one of the best in history.  Each scene could be extracted as piece of the best posible poetry.

934380,5,6304702019,"""The dark side of the heart"" (""El lado oscuro del coraz&oacute;n"") is a very surreal, dark, and sometimes depressing story about a man, Oliverio, who is constantly looking for that one woman who will finally ""make him fly"" (otherwise, they're losing their time with him).
He's a down on his luck poet who spends his time with two friends (a sculptor who only makes pieces inspired by sex and a language teacher), meeting women and trying to write poetry.
Among the most surreal elements of the movie are his constant reciting of Mario Benedetti's poetry and his conversations with death, who follows him around throughout the whole movie.
The film is sometimes slow, but is quite effective in presenting Oliverio's  dark personality.
All in all, a great movie, and a very good performance by Dario Grandinetti, the same actor from ""Talk to her"".",1057104000,,845,4.909090909090909
934381,5,6304702019,"I was fortunate enough to meet  Eliseo Subiela in person in a
Latin American in a Film festival in New York.  I was given some insight in the directors vision in making the film.  The movie touched me in a way very few Hollywood movies ever had. The film was surreal.  Something Latin American writers are great at. I loved the way the poetry from Uruguayan poet Mario Benedetti harmonized with Oliverios (Daro Grandinetti - watch in Talk to her) quest for that woman that can make him fly in love.  Subielas Second film (El lado oscuro del corazn 2  2001) was even better though that movie stands alone. After seeing the movie I remember walking through the streets of Manhattan Wanting to be in some caf in San Juan or Buenos Aires enjoying a drink and yes writing/reciting poetry like Oliverio.  I guess thats why we go to the movies. Bravo maestro Subiela!",1048982400,9,860,4.545454545454546

The characters, the story and the situations are exceptional and the script, based in the Latin american poetry of Mario Benedetti makes this film one of the most remarkable successes of the 90's in Latin American film industry.

La primer pelicula que vi fue spartacus. Apenas existe alguna huella, alguna memoria. Luego vi, a man and a woman many years later, y todavia puedo sentir las hemociones de un romantico loco. ahora, en mis cuarenta y pico vi por accidente esta pelicula y creo que me rejuvenecio como 20 anos. que lindo el poder todavia sentir y tener la esperanza resucitada. El arte tiene ese efecto, la buena arte, por supuesto, No es la pelicula, sino la poesia, la palabra viva, y los sentiminetos a carne viva. olvidence de tratar de catalogizar lo espiritual, lo humano, como puede alguin catalogar a Rimbau, Rilke, Doestoeskie, Borges, Neruda, bolanos, keroack, Miller (henry, of course). Heso es lo lindo de la literatura universal, no tine barreras ni goographias, que no se dieron cuenta que benedetti estaba leyendo en aleman en la pelicula, la lengua de Rilke y kafka.
