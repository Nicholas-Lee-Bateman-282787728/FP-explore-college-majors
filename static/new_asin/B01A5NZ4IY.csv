8746522,4,B01A5NZ4IY,First off. I am  die hard horror fan and have never found anything that scares me. The first three movies of this set I only watched  in portions. I watch these movies when I go to bed for the night.. they relax me. I am on the second set and they are becoming rather repetative and predictable. I might change my mind on that by the time I see all of them...wouldn't send them back.,1506988800,,383,4.093333333333334
