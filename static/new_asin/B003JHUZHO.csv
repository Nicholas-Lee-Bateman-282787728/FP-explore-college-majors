8398099,4,B003JHUZHO,"This was the American debut for Paul Henreid (better known as Casablanca's Victor Lazlo) and Michelle Morgan (who almost made Casablanca, but Ingrid Bergman cost Jack Warner less money so he chose Ingrid, with immortal results). Here Paul and Michelle join in the French underground. A sideline: we see the underground network chewed up and destroyed by the goings-on here depicted. By today's standards the romance is low-key but it was dynamite then, and the viewer can always imagine how Joan and Paul spent their enforced hours together. We also know the Nazis were much more brutal than depicted here--neither the contact lady (May Robson) nor Joan were tortured, as they surely would have been: Joan goes to her death with every hair in place. The commandant of Paris is suitably slimy, however, and I enjoyed the chase part. The settings are well done--they must have spent a fortune on cement making that church. Not great but well worth watching.",1360195200,4,955,4.975
8398100,3,B003JHUZHO,"""Joan of Paris"" is a 1942 black and white war romantic thriller about a group of 5 downed British airmen trying to escape from occupied France. It stars Paul Henreid as the squadron leader, Michele Morgan as the French girl who helps him, Thomas Mitchell as a priest, and Laird Cregar as the evil Nazi. This was one of the first films released after the US entered the war.

Michele Morgan (1920) received top billing. She was a popular French film star who escaped from Europe in 1940 following her highly successful ""Port of Shadows"" (1938) with Jean Gabin.. She signed with RKO where her most important film was ""Passage to Marseille"" (1944) opposite Humphrey Bogart, then returned to France after the war.

This was the US film debut for Austrian born Paul Henreid (1905-92). He will forever be the besieged Victor Laszlo from ""Casablanca"" (1942) or Jerry Durrance lighting two cigarettes at once from ""Now Voyager"" (1942), despite his more than 40 other films. Henried was a victim of the communist scare and was blacklisted as an actor, turning his attentions to directing and work on stage.

FWIW - Henreid and Morgan were among the first Hollywood stars to tour the country and raise money for war bonds.

Thomas Mitchell (1892-1962) is best remembered for his supporting roles as Scarlett O'Hara's father in ""GWTW"" (1939) and Uncle Billy in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). Over a 38 year career he won an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Tony.

Laird Cregar (1913-44) often played villains in films like ""I Wake up Screaming"" (1941) and ""The Lodger"" (1944) but he could also play effectively in comedies like ""Charley's Aunt"" and ""Rings on Her Fingers"" (1942). My favorite Cregar performance was as Sir Henry Morgan in ""The Black Swan"" (1942).

Alan Ladd (1913-64) has a small part as one of the flyers, but he got very good reviews and his performance here earned him the breakout role in ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942). He followed it with memorable performances in ""Two Years Before the Mast"" and ""the Blue Dahlia"", both in 1946, and Shane (1953) cemented his A list credentials and he remained a top star until his death in 1964.

FWIW - Cregar and Ladd both did ""This Gun for Hire"" following ""Joan of Paris"".

Australia born May Robson (1858-1942) plays a member of the French resistance. Robson was everyone's favorite granny, a part she played in films like ""Irene"" (1940), ""They Made Me a Criminal"" (1939), and ""A Star is Born"" (1937). She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Lady for a Day"" (1934). Robson looks old and frail in this film, and in fact it was her last.

Look for Hans Conreid (1917-82) in an uncredited role as a Nazi. Conreid is best known as Uncle Tonoose from ""Make Room for Daddy"" (1956-63). He appeared in dozens of films and made hundreds of appearances on TV.

Director Robert Stevenson (1905-86) made more than 40 films between 1932 and 1976. He started out making drama and action films (""King Solomon's Mines"", ""Jane Eyre"") and ended up working almost exclusively in comedies and musicals. He was nominated for an Oscar and a DGA for his work on ""Mary Poppins"" (1964).

1942 was a good year in films - ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" and ""Mrs. Miniver"" were the clear Oscar winners and at the box office. Other popular films included ""Casablanca"", ""Woman of the Year"", Alan Ladd's ""This Gun for Hire"", Gary Cooper's ""Pride of the Yankees"", and ""Road to Morocco""

Many films in 1942 dealt with the war - ""Across the Pacific"", ""Flying Tigers"", ""The Goose Steps Out"", ""In Which we Serve"", ""Invisible Agent"", ""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"", ""Saboteur"", and ""Wake Island"".

Bosley Crowther in The NY Times said - ""There are, doubtless, untold dramas and deeds of noble sacrifice occurring every day now under the darkling roofs of Paris. Sometime in the future, when the lamps of that great city burn bright again, the world may know and pay honor to some of her nameless heroes of today, but until then our minds can only fancy the contours of their grave and perilous lives. Such a manifest fancy, within the realm of probability, is RKO's ""Joan of Paris,""

Given that the film had some very urgent messages to give to the people of 1942, what does it say more than half a century later? As a film, it's pretty poor. The romance is tepid, at best, and the seemingly never ending chase scene through the (poorly staged version of the) streets of Paris is comical rather than exciting. The Nazis are very polite and not very threatening much less sadistic and cruel, and the acts of bravery are pretty pedestrian. It's easy to see how the film offered succor to the 1942 audience, but it doesn't offer much today.",1329696000,6,4625,4.693827160493827
8398101,5,B003JHUZHO,"This is an outstanding WW 2 thriller. It is very suspenseful. Those who enjoy old black and white movies from the 30's and 40's should enjoy this one. The acting and photography is excellent. I had never heard of Michelle Morgan before, but she was very compelling in this movie. I watched it on TCM, but would love to see it on DVD. Highly recommended.",1329523200,3,353,4.446153846153846
8398102,5,B003JHUZHO,"Paris 1943. A British bomber is shot down over Paris on its way back from a mission. Paul Henreid(Casablanca)is head of the squad looking for a place for the crew to hide. The local priest,Thomas Mitchell(Gone With The Wind,Its A Wonderful Life)take the crew in and hides them in the catacombs under the church..Paul is the only one that didn't make it.
Paul meets deeply religious Michelle Morgan and they fall in love.
Hot on their trail is Laird Cregar(The Lodger,Blood And Sand,This Gun For Hire,)the Gestapo head of Paris.
Alan Ladd has a small part as ill fated,Baby,one of Henreids squad. Some people think this is Alan Ladds best performance.(Of course he made better films,Shane,This Gun For Hire,The Great Gatsby,OSS,etc)
Great WW2 film.",1325030400,3,747,5.032258064516129
8398103,5,B003JHUZHO,"Joan of Paris is about 5 British RAF flyers shot down over occupied France during WWII.  They must make their way to Paris and the French underground in order to escape back to England.  The lead character (Paul), played by Paul Henreid, must hook up with his fellow pilots but is being followed everywhere by a Gestapo agent.  In the meantime, he falls in love with a French waitress (Joan, played by Michele Morgan), who has connections to the French underground.  She helps him and his friends escape back to England at her own perile.  This is a well done fictional film that provides insight into French life during WWII, especially the French underground and the tactics of the German Gestapo.  And it has a nice love story mixed in.",1102723200,17,739,4.6461538461538465
