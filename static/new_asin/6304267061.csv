7866671,5,6304267061,"A miracle season for the legendary franchise. Odds were against them from the beginning starting with the hiring of Joe Torre whom the press thought he was a bad choice for manager. Before the series began everybody thought the Yankees were finished and the Braves would have an easy victory. The media, the columnists, the Braves players, the Braves fans, and even the mayor of Atlanta back then said the Yankees were no competition. Even when the Braves dominated the first two games everyone was thinking sweep. Then came the miracles in Atlanta when the Yankees took control and suddenly the games became exciting and dramatic all the way to the victorious finale in New York silencing all doubters. Any fan who experienced those nights would enjoy taking a trip down memory lane with this film which rightly deserves to be on DVD.",1413763200,,835,4.846153846153846

7866674,5,6304267061,"Before 1996 Joe Torre had been considered a players manager and a pretty good one.  In 1996 he got his first chance with the Yankees and managed them to his first world title and the Yankees first since 1978 and their 23ed overall.  Litle did he know thatafter losing to Clevelnad in the 1997 playoffs he would rattle off three more in a row.  This year he has moved on to manage the Dodgers.

In 1996 the were a tough and scrapy team led by the rookie shortstop Derek Jeter, setup man Mariano Rivera and closer Joh Wettland.  Paul O'Neill also played a big role in the Yankees success that year.",1207526400,37,596,4.333333333333333
