3514326,3,B001CN9ICA,"(Three and a half stars: ***1/2) It is very difficult to talk about this film without giving away the ending.  It works as a mystery, a road-trip, and also as a kind of love story.  It is a metaphor of the relationships between East and West Germany and also about the corruption power of money in capitalism, both for men and (extensively discussed) for women.  It receives three and a half stars instead of four because the ending is abrupt and does not bring the message home completely.  I even wonder if the ending was necessary.  Please watch and discuss.",1217808000,2,561,4.57
8288277,1,B001CN9ICA,"I am all for a twisty cryptic psychological thriller but let me tell you this is not it.  Extremely unoriginal ""twist"" anyone can see coming a mile away.  Of the ""like watching paint dry"" variety.",1481500800,,196,4.571428571428571

8288280,3,B001CN9ICA,"Sometimes the line between art and garbage can be very fine. Some may find this movie very profound while some may think this is the most boring movie ever. I do not think like the latter, but I do not fault those who do either. I like the eerie quietness of this movie: there are no special effects, no elaborate Hollywood studio sets, everything is sparse and stark in this movie. However ""you are not smart enough to get this"" and ""often the truth is very simple and clear"" can go hand in hand. One thing for sure is Yella is not a simplistic film, so if you are looking for a crowd-pleaser you have to look elsewhere.",1406592000,,621,4.271186440677966
8288281,4,B001CN9ICA,"""Yella"" (2007 release from Germany; 89 min.) brings the story of Yella (played by Nina Hoss), whom we get to know as the movie opens with her arrival at the train station. She is stalked by Ben, who must be a bitter ex-boyfriend or significant other. Yella arrives at her father's house and excitedly informs him she found a job in the big city (Hanover). She will take the train to Hanover the next morning. Next morning, instead of the expected cab driver, it is Ben who offers to take her to the train station. Yella reluctantly agrees. To tell you more would ruin your viewing pleasure of this plot-heavy movie, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: ""Yella"" completes German director Christian Petzold's so-called ""ghost"" trilogy (started with ""The State I Am In"" in 2000, and continued with ""Ghosts"" in 2005). While these three movies are plot-wise unrelated to each other, there are clearly certain themes coming back, none more so than a critical look at how Germans are adjusting to the ""new"" (i.e. post-unification) Germany. Second, without giving anything away from the plot of ""Yella"", just know that this movie deals quite a bit with venture capital. Yes, that seems quite a stretch from the quick introduction that I wrote up earlier, you'll just have to see how the movie gets there, and get ready for a wild ride along the way. Third, Just as Petzold relied on Julia Hummer for ""The State I Am In"" and ""Ghosts"", he now puts the movie's weight on Nina Hoss, and she comes through brilliantly. Not surprisingly, Petzold has called on her again in his subsequent movies (2008's ""Jerichow"" and 2012's brilliant ""Barbara"").  Fourth, the DVD comes with several nice extras. There is a 50 min. documentary called ""Nothing Ventured"" about venture capital in Germany, and from which Petzold took some inspiration when writing ""Yella"". Then there is an 8 page film essay about Petzold and  ""Yella"" from a German film critic which puts all of this in a delightful context. Excellent reading material AFTER you have seen ""Yella"".

Bottom line: in my humble opinion, Christian Petzold is one of the very best European movie directors of this generation, and his entire ""ghost"" trilogy makes for compelling and riveting viewing. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that will take you on quite a wild ride, even if it involves something as potentially boring as accounting and venture capitalism, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Yella"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1395187200,,2512,4.848484848484849
8288282,4,B001CN9ICA,"Nina Hoss plays Yella in Petzold's metaphysical thriller. The film seemed to allegorise aspects of therelationship between the failed East Germany and the successful WestGermany. About her ex partner,Ben(Schonemann),Yella says,""I don't love him any more because he's ruined...that's why I have a bad conscience"".By leaving her husband whose business has failed in East Germany and crossing to Hanover for a new job in the West,she is selling her soul for worldly wealth. Her new lover,Philip(Streisow) who employs her in a series of shady business practices in venture capitalism is a fraud. Her ex who she sees after being stalked by him(or in hallucination) says the company destroyed their love,he's willing to become a plumber to hold onto their love. Philip said he doesn't want a conventional life of settling down in the suburbs with a wife and child and car. We see Yella's debasement via this embrace of ruthless big-business practices Petzold is not concerned with plot or character development. The cool, corporate world of capitalism is unreal and Hoss proves the cynosure of the film's weirder atmospherics, with a look of her eyes,a smile,and the anxiety-driven paranoia of what she's given up. She has premonitions about a businessman's suicide. This is a ruthless,cutthroat world,with something deeper and darker lurking beneath. We break into the dream-like world Yella inhabits through the sounds of running water,the wind in the trees,the cawing of crows,a broken glass on the floor. Her ex-husband is deranged and tries continually to get her back. The Elbe is the dividing line between the old world and the new life. A car that her ex drives her to the station in is driven by him off the bridge into the river. I liked the film but it's not satisfying nourishment as Petzold seems to drive it to a wrong ending and shows a failure of nerve in what could have been fantastic. Hoss's performance alone is reason to watch. Menacing and full of ill-omen. Is Yella only dreaming her escape from the lake into which her stalker ex-husband has plunged her?",1334361600,2,2072,5.043731778425656
8288283,3,B001CN9ICA,"Petzold is only partially successful with this moody examination of love and corruption, where plot is sidelined in favour of mood and enigma. Now, there's nothing wrong with that: I love riddle-like movies that often alienate others, but here the meat of the movie is too slight to carry the mystery. Yella's experiences on her vaguely picaresque journey fail to compel in the way intended. It's never boring but most of the fascination is supplied by Hoss's reticent performance, which is wistful and haunting. Another failure is the final twist, which is all too obvious quite early on and produces a sigh rather than a gasp. But overall this movie somehow manages the hold the attention and is worth watching, if only for Hoss's performance.",1269993600,,745,4.968
8288284,4,B001CN9ICA,"This is no 1 star movie as another reviewer lamely gave it.  Yella is a weird puzzling film, part thriller, part NOIR, part completely abstract, and by ""abstract"" I mean I didn't ""get"" the ending, or the hints that were building up to it..  Then again who understood the Beatles ""I Am The Walrus""?  Or countless other works of suggestive yet obscure art?  This movie does make suggestions and perhaps there are answers to the inevitable ""what did it mean?""

I will say that for the 90 or so minutes that this movie runs, I was engrossed, intrigued and very much in awe of the performances all around.  Nina Hoss (Yella) speaks volumes with her silences (with her voice as well) though for all the silences in this movie, there's water boiling beneath it, an edgy tension that keeps you hooked - the silence itself creates more suspense than any cinematic music could have.  In jazz they say ""Silence swings"".  In this movie it is also the empty places that give meaning to what is there, and lest anybody get the wrong idea, there is quite a bit of dialogue and it's as interesting as any good courtroom drama. The movie moves at a surprisingly quick pace.  It is by no accounts boring.  It is a thriller every bit as exciting as any novel by Grisham.  Only it's obtuse ending and the complete bewilderment that it left me in at the end keep me from giving it 5 stars, although that may be shortsigtedness on my part.  As I write, possible explanations for what the ending may have meant come drifting past like some faint scent that you sense you may almost recognize before it is gone.  This movie would make an interesting forum for discussion.

Yella: ""You thought I slept with Schmitt-Ott to get that job.""

Philipp: ""That doesn't matter to me.""

Yella: ""That's not an answer.""

Philipp: ""You're right.""",1254700800,6,1808,4.582554517133956
8288285,4,B001CN9ICA,"This enigmatic drama is a story of a young woman who confronts her ambitions and insecurities head on. The film starts with Yella accepting a new job and moving to the more modernized western part of the country. With hopes for a better future, the life she leaves behind include her loving father, her obsessive husband, and the stability of a reality understood.

Christian Petzold uses a bold no frills approach to exhibit this thought provoking film. The narrative has a minimalistic quality which serves the film well, allowing the viewer to focus on the subtle yet compelling performance by actress Nina Hoss. Yella is an intelligently layered film and a triumph for modern day German cinema.",1245456000,12,698,4.965811965811966
8288286,1,B001CN9ICA,"(1.) The DVD needs a warning, particularly to non-German audiences, because this abstract (meaning - it's so obscure you can read whatever you want into it) parable has allusions embedded in German history and economics.
(2.) Filmed largely in a car being driven from one room to another  (total of about four rooms). A woman (Yella) is looking for a job, has had a bad marriage, stole some money, died in a car accident.
(3.) Acting - hard to say since half of the movie focused on Yella sitting and essentially not doing much. Except close-ups suggest that the audience should look for deep subtle facial expressions.
(4.) I suggest that if one needs to spend 90 minutes in some profound activity better to read any book or go for a walk.",1241913600,4,740,4.606060606060606
