8079995,4,B000AWKSU0,"A decent production with a good budget, but the story is preposterous in a comic book sort of way.
I get the impression this was Tom Baker and Lala Ward's way of mixing business with pleasure, a bit indulgent.
It is a vacation obviously for the main characters and the actors who portray them but it weakens the story to concentrate on the Doctor and Romana so much. A little tedious overall.
Julian Glover is an effective villain as is the lovely Catherine Schell whom I remember fondly from SPACE:1999 and The Return Of The Pink Panther film.
K-9 is inexplicably absent in this story and is barely mentioned in passing, we never hear one beep or blip from him.
The John Cleese cameo is fun, I wish he had a substantial performance here. He would have been an interesting villain!

This story is an interesting concept but it had more potential. Maybe a lack of time affected this production. We do see a lot of footage of the Doctor and Romana running through the streets of Paris with curious onlookers.
Beautiful scenery, great sets and locations don't make for a masterpiece.
Story and execution are what matters.

City Of Death is a very near miss for me but it is fun and still worthwhile.

It's just a bit like watching someone's holiday home videos.",1497139200,,1258,4.582222222222223

8079997,5,B000AWKSU0,"One of Baker's best episodes. Great fun and really worth a look for fans of the classic Who's. I really think that the more I watch Lalla Ward the more I appreciate her turn as a companion. She brings an added flair to the goings on in this episode.
This story has both comedy and gothic suspense with it's sci fi which Who has always done so well with.
The scene at the end is really the best ending in the history of Who!
Julian Glover and Catherine Schell are excellent as the villains and really do keep the show moving. The cast and pace make for a fun evening of Who viewing!",1490486400,,581,4.150442477876106
8079998,4,B000AWKSU0,"The DVD is very good. I was looking forward to watching it for a show that I do on the weekends. The DVD is very good. NOW, I am working on the book!",1470787200,,149,3.5454545454545454
8079999,5,B000AWKSU0,Proof positive It's nice to have an all region DVD player. You get access to the good stuff at reasonable prices.,1455580800,,113,4.428571428571429
