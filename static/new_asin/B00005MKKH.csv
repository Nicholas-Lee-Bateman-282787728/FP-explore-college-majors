1625610,4,B00005MKKH,"Nicely observed portrait of West Texans at that moment when the traditional individualistic ways of the maverick wildcatters collided with the more sophisticated, play-it-safe high-tech future. Story comes wrapped up as a romance between real-life husband-and-wife Terry Jastrow and Anne Archer.
The film does a fine job of idealizing the nuts-and-bolts of small-scale oil drilling, and makes that far more interesting than you might expect. The plot is clichd, and the characters stereotypical, but somehow, the excellent screenplay uses familiarity to anchor us quickly into place, and then spends its own leisurely time drawing in the details that bring the whole thing to quite pleasurable life.
It's familiar without being clichd, fleshed-out without being eccentric, dignified without being pompous. Credit the writer, and the likeability of the cast, most particularly Jastrow, who is quite charming. Richard Farnsworth also stands out in a very effective early sequence.
That said, there's a fuzziness to the technicals, to the lighting and editing and such. A better director could have made ""Waltz Across Texas"" absolutely sparkle. As it is, though, it's still a small, slightly under-polished gem.",1054857600,8,1208,5.60655737704918
1625611,4,B00005MKKH,"After years of searching, I'd about lost hope that this movie would ever again become available on video. It's not only highly entertaining with some great actors but will hold viewers attention from start to finish in this engrossing story of survival in the search for oil. Using crude technology and wits, even those not involved in the oil industry will enjoy this movie.",1014768000,11,375,4.875
1625612,5,B00005MKKH,"The most enchanting moment in this nice little film occurs when John Taylor renders a lilting litany, realizing that Gail has never heard of the Longhorns, the Cougars, the Owls, the Red Raiders, the Horned Frogs, the Razorbacks, the Mustangs, the Bears or the Aggies -- the fine old teams of the Southwest Conference (which was wholly dominated during its entire existence by the Aggies of Texas A&M).  John is rueful that Gail hasn't ever heard these names, especially the Aggies -- he is astounded that a highly educated individual such as she has never heard of the Aggies.
And, you need to see this film just to watch the old cable-tool rig operate, and hear its muffled impacts somewhere downhole as it noses for oil.  If you have anything to do with the oil business, and you of course realize how thoroughly the Texas Aggies dominated the old Southwest Conference, this movie is definitely for you.",1014768000,8,906,4.764331210191083

1625615,5,B00005MKKH,"I first enjoyed Waltz Across Texas at least 35 years ago and I have wished many times, since then, that I could view it again. It is really a true love story of two people who obviously could never get together and ended up deeply in love. When I learned that Amazon had made it available I ordered it immediately. The quality of the DVD rendition is even better than the VHF version of the 1980's. And even if you are not a fan of Country/Western music you will be delighted by the occasional background of the old Country songs. If you were old enough to be in love back then the scenes of young people dancing to live music in a typical western dance hall you may find yourself reaching for a Kleenex to wipe your eyes. My wife and I have watched it three times since we received it. The only negative thing that I could say about the DVD is that it is not available with Closed Caption.",1404259200,2,890,4.2105263157894735
1625616,3,B00005MKKH,"I would recommend this film to anyone. Not a block buster but a funny, romantic story with no deaths, political meaning, and almost no special effects.",1403740800,,151,4.846153846153846
1625617,5,B00005MKKH,This was a gift for my husband. This was the first movie he saw Ann Archer in and became a big fan.  So I purchased the movie for him.,1401148800,,134,3.6206896551724137

1625619,5,B00005MKKH,Excellent regional depiction of the oil and gas industry during that particular era.  Well rounded with the love story surrounding the saga.,1390262400,,140,5.363636363636363

1625621,5,B00005MKKH,"I enjoyed this movie so much when I saw it years ago. Also I lived in West Texas for over 15 years. For these reasons, I began watching for it on Amazon Prime as soon as I joined.  Please bring it on for us, I would so love to watch it again.  I seldom buy movies, but would rent it in a heartbeat.",1382313600,,298,3.7142857142857144
1625622,5,B00005MKKH,I had originally come across this during a late night feeding with my son years ago. An adorable film. It will make you smile.,1377820800,,126,4.291666666666667

1625624,5,B00005MKKH,"Entertaining, with some good actors from a few years back. Don't often get a husband & wife leading role in movies today.",1367280000,,121,4.545454545454546
1625625,5,B00005MKKH,"I worked all over the West Texas oil fields from Wink to Andrews, and I can tell you this film is an excellent representation.  The dance sequence with the Texas Two-Step to ""One Hot Juke Box"" was a real Texas hoedown!  And Ernest Tubb did very well, too, along with Ann Archer and Mary Kay Place.  Enjoy, Ya'all!",1306022400,2,313,4.362068965517241
1625626,3,B00005MKKH,"I have seen this film and enjoyed it many years ago. With my failing memory, I thought Ed Harris played the lead role and I wanted to see some of his earlier works again. Unfortunately, Ed Harris was not the leading man but real life Anne Archers husband. I purchased it anyway, and it was not as good as I remembered, the age of the film is showing and it has the low budget look. The chemistry is there with Archer and her husband and the towel scene is still classic. Mary Kay Place was a delight to see as supporting actress. I just loved her accent in this film even if it was a bit over the top. I own it now, so I may look at again when nostolgia occurs to see Anne Archer or MKP. Last film I saw with Anne was  her film with Tommy Lee Jones in ""Man of the House"". If your looking for an old TEXAS romance film, this just might fill the bill.",1296172800,,849,3.9649122807017543
1625627,4,B00005MKKH,"I saw this movie years ago.  When I ran across it on-line I bought it to see if it was really as good as I'd remembered.  It is. Screenplay may be a little ""hokey"" but the story is fun.",1235088000,,185,3.717948717948718
1625628,3,B00005MKKH,"This is a good gem of a movie well worth viewing.  My dad was in the oil business and I remember hearing about this movie when it was being filmed in and around Midland, Texas.  I grew up in Midland and was about 12 at the time.  My mom heard when and where the final climactic scene was to be filmed, so we went out on the location and stood around for a good while with other curious on-lookers.

We had a good time that day.  We were positioned over by some trailers and, at one point, Anne Archer walked right by us to get ready for the scene.  Another interesting thing I remember is that this scene turned out somewhat differently in the final cut of the film.  I remember an extra actor was in the scene that day.  I believe he was one of the regular characters on the TV series Grizzly Adams a few years prior.  I was surprised at his absence when I saw the film with my parents in Midland because I liked that actor very much from television.

However, it was still good to see the scene filmed and then to see some of it on the big screen months later.  It was quite an experience and it's a good movie. It takes me back to that time period in Midland with some familiar places of my childhood.",1215993600,2,1204,4.102564102564102
1625629,5,B00005MKKH,"A W*O*N*D*E*R*F*U*L Movie, and one my roommate ane I 'nearly saw' being
filmed.  Being live theatre buffs AND actresses, we thought we would be able to at least glimpse the stars in lil' 'ole Marfa.  Nay, nay, naton!
So we drove all the way back to Midland basking in the nearness of them.

1625631,5,B00005MKKH,Being from Midland you might say I'm a homer and thus have a bias towards this movie.  This movie was literally made at the very end of the oil boom period - in fact many of the companies' whose name appear through out the movie had gone out of business by the time it was released (that's how fast the bust hit).  Terry Jastrow (who is from Midland) and his real life wife Anne Archer are great opposite each other on the screen while Mary Kay Place provides great commentary on life in Texas Oil Business.,1125187200,,507,4.270833333333333
1625632,4,B00005MKKH,"This is a good Texas movie.  My dad was a Land Man (secures the leases to drill) so I grew up in this milieu.  Two guys really can bring in a well if the pay is not too deep.  All of the high school guys in oil country worked as roustabouts (general labor) or rig hands during the summers.  When two guys get together, we discuss who missed what block or who jumped offside before we talk about women.  Some of the minor characters in the movie have the names of real oil men and women.  Good stuff.",1087344000,13,499,4.040816326530612
