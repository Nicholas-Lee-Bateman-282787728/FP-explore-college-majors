If you do understand spanish you will have a great laugh.",1163116800,2,398,4.089743589743589
8109870,4,B000EHQUSK,"I originally saw this movie broadcasted on Univision (Ch. 34 in L.A.) and like it because of it has goofy/funny/sassy situations, and allowed the attractive women in it to show off.  I love the voluptuous built of mexican women and this movie does not disappoint.  I bought this movies because I especially like Diana Herrera, and i was hoping to pick up the nude scene that the broadcast version had pixelated.  However, this DVD version has been edited and the portion of the scene that had the pixelation was deleted.  I am still happy with the rest of the movie since it is a major improvement over the broadcasted version that I had recorded in VHS, but I don't understand why that one scene was removed from the DVD. I will now have to assumed that all other DVD titles associated with UniCine were also edited and probably not worth buying.",1154563200,3,847,4.589403973509934
