8013602,5,B0001KNH6S,"This video series has a pornographic quality for any person who has ever desired to take a stack of lumber and turn it into a home. It is a joy to watch Larry Haun work, and you get the impression he has both experience in and genuine enthusiasm for his trade. Even if you do not aspire to build houses, this video is full of neat carpentry tricks and will teach you things you can use on any project--big or small.",1369440000,,415,4.135802469135802

Everyone beware!!",1316995200,,420,6.368421052631579
8013604,1,B0001KNH6S,Moves way to fast and doesn't explain anything well. He basically assumes that you know what he's talking about. I didn't find this product useful.,1301097600,,147,4.92
8013605,4,B0001KNH6S,"These guys work as a team.  I enjoyed watching them.  Was helpful when the went into detail with the model about corners studs.  They showed how to plumb and align walls.  I am a beginner, so I found this tape really helpful, and useful on the job when other people did not know what I was talking about until I showed them the trick.  I recommmend all their tapes",1141084800,,364,4.217391304347826
8013606,5,B0001KNH6S,"""Framing Walls,"" with Larry Haun, is just one of a series of 3 DVD's that will explain, and show you exactly how to build your own home. The other two DVD's are titled, ""Framing Floors & Stairs,"" and ""Framing Roofs."" In this complete series, along with a book entitled ""The Very Efficient Carpenter,"" Larry, goes into very specific detail on how to handle each step of the home-building process as you watch him and his brother Joe build a 1600 square-foot home from the foundation to the rooftop. Each DVD in this series is very well organized into different chapters. Therefore, if you need some clairificaton on positioning and cutting plates, for example, it's just a matter of revisiting that chapter until you understand the concept.",1096588800,20,739,4.873015873015873
