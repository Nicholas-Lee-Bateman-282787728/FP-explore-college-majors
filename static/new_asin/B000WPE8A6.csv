2989100,4,B000WPE8A6,"In my opinion, this is a great insite into the musical mind of the master.
 Great video of Allan in the studio with his band, including lottsa closeups on Allan's hands in action. As with most true greats, his humbleness shows during his explanations of how he thinks of chords and scale composition which, for me, is opening doors in how I rethink the guitar.
 The only downside of this DVD is that not all of the video material is transcribed in the attached .pdf file. Also, the page layout is such that there are only two stalves per sheet, making printing out the solos an arduous task. I would recommend purchasing Allan's 'Just for the Curious' to obtain more transcriptions (with some duplication) for more songs from this DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Allan-Holdsworth/dp/B000WPE8A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Allan Holdsworth</a>",1199577600,2,883,5.582089552238806
2989101,4,B000WPE8A6,"I'm a professional touring guitarist as well as a clinician, and as one that has years of studying under his belt, I find this video to be too much of a departure from any musical language that I know.  Some things are applicable to more conventional playing (such as 4 note per string scales and symmetrical playing), but Holdsworth isn't a great teacher.  One must work to decipher useful things from this DVD, but for anyone in search of radically new ideas, it is worth the work. For everyone else, there are a few useful tips and scales. As I find with most videos, if you learn only one useful thing from it, it is an incredible value.",1197417600,10,641,4.423728813559322
2989102,5,B000WPE8A6,"There are very few official videos of Allan Holdsworth out there, amazingly.  This one is great because, though it is marketed as an instructional video, over half of it is Allan and his band performing, taped close up in a studio environment.  So the video and audio quality is excellent.  Includes Steve Hunt on keys, Skuli Sverrisson on bass, and Chad Wackerman on drums ... my favourite lineup.  The other Holdsworth vid that's worth getting is Blues For Tony, with Alan Pasqua, Live At Yoshi's Jazz Club ... you get some Holdsworth compositions as well as some old Tony Williams ones... and the quality is excellent also.  I would give the vid 'Live at the Galaxy' a miss, unless you're a diehard fan, the quality is just not great (fuzzy video, and mushy sound).",1394668800,4,768,4.701492537313433
2989103,5,B000WPE8A6,"I am a long time A/H fan and am always searching for new ways to enjoy his unique approach to guitar, and music in general. When I saw this DVD offering on my recommended list, I thought I had finally found an opportunity to figure out just what it was that I was hearing on all these cd,s, vinyl, etc that I had been mesmerized by for so long.
  Well, this is an amazing way to see, and hear Allan play and talk about what he does, but it makes my brain hurt if I try too hard to grasp what the *^#&! he is talking about. Easier to just let it settle into my subconcious a little at a time, and enjoy it without necessarily understanding why. Some great insights into the mind of A/H, and some fantastic live recordings of him and the band.",1314403200,,741,4.068493150684931
2989104,5,B000WPE8A6,"This is a re issue of the old REH video from 1992. The original VHS release was very expensive, but this is very well priced indeed. Its taken a long time for this to get to DVD but here it is at last. Unlike a lot of instructional vids this has a 45 minute studio concert containing 7 tracks - Funnels, Proto Cosmos, Looking Glass, The Things u See, Tell Me, Zones, and House Of Mirrors.

The 4tet featured consists of Steve Hunt on keyboards, Skulli Sverrison on Bass and Chad Wackerman on drums.

The ""live"" tracks are excellent and the sound is very good. The instructional parts are interesting to watch and there's lots of info about his approach to playing which is very enlightening. The live parts are interspersed with the instructional. There is also the option to just play the live tracks or just the instructional if you wish. The sound is much improved over the original vhs version. If you're into holdsworth this is a must but there again you probably aren't here reading this by accident. There's also the option to print out pdf files on your pc which comprises tablature for some of the songs featured and the 10 most useful scales he features.

This does not contain any new Holdsworth bonus material only a reissue of the original VHS onto DVD. Recommended",1280534400,,1278,4.572052401746725
2989105,5,B000WPE8A6,"I think that this video is mis-understood.  Allen admits that he is not much of an instructor; you should not look at this video as a formal instructional piece, but rather an observational tool.  In order to get get instructional value you need to watch and re-watch it and read between Allen's lines.  All the scales are given in a nice little package (PDF file) with the DVD.  Print out the scales and practice the hell out of them.  A lot of Allen does is based on his incredible knowledge of scales; for the rest, as he so casually puts it, ""just go for it.""  If you are the type of person that needs your hand held through things, this might not be a good DVD for you; but if you are self-motivated and don't mind independent studies, then this DVD will be a great addition to your collection.",1272326400,2,799,4.328859060402684
2989106,5,B000WPE8A6,"Another real outstanding DVD of Allan Holdsworth. It shows a complete insight view of the 10 more used scales by middleage Holdsworth (their favorites), as well as its relationship with his enigmatic chord voicings; combining all this visual material with an interesting warmth chat, plus a fantastic live performance in the studio with Chad Wackerman on Drums, Skuli Sverrissen on Bass and his old friend Steve Hunt on Keyboards; here, you can listen and watch full close-up shots of Allan Holdsworth's amazing left hand technique. The performed songs in this little studio jam are:

1. Zone, 2. Proto Cosmos, 3. Funnels, 4. Tell Me, 5. The Things You See, 6. Looking Glass, And 7. House Full Of Mirrors.

Between songs, Allan Holdsworth explains the meaning of each song, why he composed it; and sometimes how to play it. though he clearly explains that he doesn't see himself as a kind of a teacher to talk about all these material, and highly recommends to explore and try to develop a style...

This DVD is a reissue of an 1992 REH Video collection, and shows middleage Holdsworth and his band at their best. Don't miss the opportunity to see this ""guitarist of guitarists"" at his full musical potential. With this DVD the revolutionary Allan Holdsworth proves again why he is one of the most unique and respected guitarists around. Really out of this world!... Good Luck!",1266710400,9,1377,4.8760683760683765
2989107,4,B000WPE8A6,"Allan Holdsworth is absolutely amazing, just don't ask him to explain how he does it, because he won't (or can't) tell you. This video is extremely useful in that it allows you to see the fingering of some of Mr. Holdsworth's best tunes, however, a detailed explanation that all of us Holdsworthian afectionatos would dream of getting is not there. Rather, it outlines the scales he uses and then shows you him playing a song. The nice part definitely is the fact that most of the time it shows you a close up of his fingers. So if not for anything else, I would definitely purchase the DVD for at least that, because it might not be an explanation but sometimes demonstrative examples speak louder than explanations ever could.",1217548800,4,728,4.651162790697675
2989108,5,B000WPE8A6,"I wouldn't say you can learn much of anything from this video. Allan gives some fairly brief explanations about his use of scales and stands next to some diagrams professor style, talking about how useful they are.

The reason to watch this video is for the large amount of footage of Allan while he is playing. Most of which with his band. If you're a fan of his music, then this DVD will go a long way in decoding his chops.

  I am, on a good day, an intermediate to advanced player so I can watch him and I can actually understand what he's doing. Sort of.  The problem is, is that Holdsworth's chops are so far beyond most guitarists, his approach to music is so ""outside the box""  and that he seems to have no idea of how advanced he actually is.

  For a healthy part of his solos, his index finger stays close to the 10th fret and his pinky stays around 17-19 and they more-or-less just dance around, creating a dizzying array of wide intervallic melodies that go screaming by. He seems to think that this is normal, that anyone who plays guitar can do this, and that his abilities hardly warrant having an instructional video.

  So there's a lot going on in his brain that just doesn't seem to occur to him to share or even bother to articulate. So, if you're the kind of guitarist who can learn a lot just by watching someone play, this video is awesome.

  If you're the kind who needs an explanation beyond some British mumbling about preferring to not have ""licks"" then there are probably better videos for you.

  I bought it because I'm a big fan of Holdsworth and I just wanted some good footage of him playing. I got that out of it and I consider anything else a bonus.",1208736000,58,1687,4.335463258785943
2989109,5,B000WPE8A6,"I've played guitar since 1984 and since this came out in 92 I watch it every 5 years or so and get something out of it everytime.  Just as Allan's music is pretty idiosyncratic, so is this video :).  He doesn't talk to you like a beginner, he pretty much explains it as if he were talking to John McLaughlin or Steve Vai - it's just Allan explaining how he sees the fretboard and how he writes songs.  There's no ""licks"", or tricks or warm up exercises, etc...he literally ""shows"" 10 or 15 scales which he uses and how he thinks of them and how he creates parallel moving harmonies.  The scales are not nearly as exotic as you'd think, except for the last few.  The best part of this are the performances which have almost no connection to the talking parts.  He and his band rip through some songs (which are better that the album versions in some cases) and then he talks some more.  Allan also comes across as an extremely honest and humble guy, and stresses that you should find your own voice.  I guess that's a very good thing about what he delivers here - he gives you the tools to play like Allan or create your own sound...whereas in an Yngwie video you learn a bunch of Yngwie licks so you can become an Yngwie clone.  Bottom line this is a hard video to watch one time and absorb all at once, best to revisit every few years and grasp more each time.  Even after learning all the theory stuff, just watching the performances can teach quite alot about solo and group improvisation.",1207958400,5,1492,4.33453237410072
2989110,5,B000WPE8A6,"Allan Holdsworth, gur guitarrist, great in all aspects. If you hear and see his performances will realise that He is easily one of best guitarrist in the world ever. He is remembered for his participations in Tony William's Lifetime, UK, Jean Luc Ponty, Bill Bruford, Gong, Level 42, Soft Machine and many others. His style very singular, expresive, creative, his refine technique and speed had been commented by artists such as Eddie VanHalen, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Neal Schon, etc...
In this concert in Japan He joined Steve Hunt, Chad Wackerman, Skuli Sverrisson in a great band in a studio performing live classics like ""Funnels"", ""Looking Glass"", ""the Things You See"", ""Zone"".

8224979,5,B000WPE8A6,"This video makes it clear why there's only one Allan Holdsworth, and there will never be another.

First of all, his music is complex and sometimes dissonant in ways that will captivate some listeners while deterring others.  So be it, this isn't meant to be pop music.  Fortunately, enough people like it to have enabled Allan to make a career of creating this music.

In terms of *how* he creates this music, the video makes it clear that Allan operates on an incredibly advanced level.  He's done a lot of intellectually demanding work to thoroughly explore the theoretical side of music - that takes a lot of intelligence and also a lot of motivation.  The result is that he's mapped out 10 key scales, many which are rather atypical.  He's able to see these scales at once on the entire fingerboard, over which he flows freely, sometimes with wide intervals, in order to creatively construct unique chords and chord sequences, melodies, and improvisational solos in a way that can never really be taught.  As if that wasn't enough, his technical prowess and control of tone are stunning.

I've been a fan of Allan for three decades, and have seen him live numerous times.  I believe that he's genuinely modest and sometimes self-critical, but whether he can fathom it or not, he's a true genius of fusion guitar, and entirely deserving of his many accolades.

While this video may not help you much in playing like Allan, it can be inspiring and hints at some general tips which can help anyone make progress (not just as a guitarist).  Moreover, it provides the opportunity to glimpse into the mind of a virtuoso musician and composer, and that makes it a precious gift for all of us.

Addendum: I wrote the above review while Allan was still with us, and I was deeply saddened to hear of his passing.  Over the course of more than three decades, his music became woven into my soul and made me a different and better person.  As both an artist and guitarist, Allan was a gift to us all, the likes of which we'll never see again.  RIP dear Allan.",1466035200,4,2052,4.6115702479338845
