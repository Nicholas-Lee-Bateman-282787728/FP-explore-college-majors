8313631,4,B000QGDXX4,"My VHS copy of Bruce And Shaolin Kung Fu was wearing out so I decided to purchase this DVD version so I could enjoy it for years to come. I am glad to say the DVD is top notch and a worthwhile purchase! The movie itself is identical to what I had on VHS, even the same Best Film opening before the film began. Picture quality was a bit crisper than my VHS version and the film is presented in full frame, like the VHS, although there is a widescreen cut of this film out there that looks even better. This is a barebone release, just containing the film itself.

Bruce and Shaolin Kung Fu is a Korean made unofficial sequel to Bruce Lee's Fist Of Fury. Bruce and Shaolin Kung Fu has two sequels as well , Bruce and Shaolin Kung Fu 2 and Return Of Fist Of Fury, making it the first of a classic action packed martial arts trilogy! As for the film itself, I am biased since this was the film that introduced me to the kung fu film genre and converted me into a fan. I always enjoy watching this film and it hooked me from the very first watching. It contains plenty of fight sequences, a fantastic opening theme song, other music ripped from other movies such as Enter The Dragon, sex, nudity, hilarious dubbing, and actor Bolo Yeung, who is always incredible!

This movie is also available on two other Kung Fu DVD movie packs, the Fist Of Fury Legacy Pack and the Ultimate Dragon Collection 10 Film Set. Both of these sets are quite affordable as well.",1416873600,,1452,4.276363636363636
