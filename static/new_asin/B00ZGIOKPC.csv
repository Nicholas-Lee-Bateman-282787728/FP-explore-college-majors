8720078,4,B00ZGIOKPC,"Requiem For a Heavyweight: Good film, no issues with playback or visual transfer.

Golden Boy: Amazing classic film, definitely the star of the DVD. Absolutely loved it. Great acting, storyline was full of passionate drama, cinematography was beautiful. Visual transfer very good, I assume it has been digitally remastered.

Joe Louis Story: stopped after the opening credits. The transfer was truly awful, it may be a good film but it was way too difficult to watch.

Overall it's well worth the price for the first two movies alone. If you like old movies, both Requiem and Golden Boy are must haves.",1532476800,,602,4.9405940594059405
