1883954,5,B00009L507,"I love this DVD!
I coach a 6th grade all-girl squad an the Cheer DVD has been a lifesaver for me.  I'm having shoulder surgery in weeks and I will not be capable of teaching my girls motions;cheers;chants or any dances for weeks and this product has really pulled through for me!

Thanks for saving me!",1184803200,2,302,4.375
1883955,5,B00009L507,I have bought 3 Cheer videos so far and this is by far the best. The motions are sharp. The moves are taught at a good pace and from the back. The material is not too suggestive. I would reccommend this one more than any other one I have bought. The best value for my money by far.,1179878400,9,281,3.8620689655172415
1883956,5,B00009L507,This DVD gives insight as to purpose of cheerleading and provides step-by-step direction for leading.,1174780800,7,101,5.8
1883957,4,B00009L507,"I purchased this for my daughter just before her 7th birthday.  It has kept her more active this winter.  She enjoys the warm up stretch, the cheers and the dance moves.  I got this just for fun but she has surprised me with how much she has learned.  She now knows the names of many of the arm positions.  This dvd is good for those girls who dream of being a cheerleader when they grow up.  have fun.",1171670400,8,402,4.089743589743589
1883958,1,B00009L507,I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYBODY LOOKING FOR DANCE MATERIAL!!!  IT HAS ONE VERY BASIC DANCE ON IT AND THAT'S IT!!!!  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,1168992000,,143,4.68
1883959,4,B00009L507,"I am a former cheerleader and cheerleading coach and really enjoy this DVD.  I bought it for my young daughter and loaned it out to some of my cheerleaders when coaching.

It teaches the basics:  the motions and what they're called, some cheers and chants, and one really fun dance routine.  It also goes a little bit into what it means to be a cheerleader for your school and what will be expected of you and the code of conduct that you'll be expected to follow.

It does NOT go into jumps or stunting at all.  The stunting is definitely something cheerleaders don't want to learn from a DVD, but I was disappointed that they didn't teach any jumps.

Another reviewer somewhere else, a former cheerleader, gave this DVD low marks because she expected to get a good workout from it and relive the good-old-days.  Let me just point out to everyone, this is an instructional DVD for beginners.  It's not a workout DVD and it's not for cheerleaders that already have a lot of cheer experience.

Also, the organization that put this DVD together is the UCA, one of the biggest cheer-instruction organizations out there.  They've been conducting cheer clinics all over the country for many years.  Other cheer organizations do some motions differently or have different names for them.  There is no right or wrong way, but aspiring cheerleaders should know this in case they make it on a squad coached by someone trained by one of the other groups.  Always follow your coach's instructions and don't challenge him or her with these differences.

One more word of advice for aspiring cheerleaders:  unless you live in a very rural, small town with a small student population and are sure there won't be much competition at try-outs, TAKE GYMNASTIC CLASSES.  Cheerleading has become very athletic and competitive.  To increase your chances in the more populated areas, you will need tumbling skills.  Dance classes - especially hip-hop - wouldn't hurt either.  Yoga - to increase balance and flexability - would help a lot, too.

Good luck!",1141689600,102,2034,4.820809248554913
1883960,4,B00009L507,"i bought this video being a new cheerleader and it really helped me with the basics. I learned 1 cheer 2-3 sidelines and 1 reapeted cheer. PLUS a great dance routine. I really suggest this for an aspiring cheerleader. but to be a great one do this video everyday or as often as you can and sign up in a gymnastics class which is exactly what im doing.
i plan to try out for my squad next april and i know i will make it from all this video has taught me.(and being in gymnastics)",1068768000,25,479,4.052631578947368
1883961,2,B00009L507,"I purchased the video for my daughter, and we were both very disappointed.  First of all the length of the video was very short.  There was nothing on jumps.  They showed only one dance routine.  My daughter is so into gymnastics/cheering and this video was no interest to her.  I believe it was the worst birthday present she received.  Another DVD to collect dust.",1059436800,34,366,4.640625
1883962,3,B00009L507,"This DVD has a very nice motion segment that teaches young cheerleaders basic motions.  However, it only teaches a few cheers and chants.",1337644800,,137,4.956521739130435
1883963,5,B00009L507,"I am a PeeWee Cheer Coach and most of my cheerleaders are between 7 and 13 years old.  My daughter and I found a piece of this video on Cox On-Demand one night and decided to watch it... my daughter, who is 9 years old is in her first year of cheer and immediately got hooked on the video.  Well, On-Demand only let us watch the first 19 minutes and then it ended, so my daughter was bummed.  I ended up buying the DVD and WE LOVE IT!!  I've shared it with all of my PeeWee Cheerleaders and they caught on right away.  GREAT INVESTMENT for beginners!!  However, I wouldn't suggest this for experienced Cheerleaders.",1320105600,,615,4.304347826086956
1883964,5,B00009L507,"This DVD is for the very beginner without any formal training. I bought this along with another more expensive DVD with the OU cheer girls and this one was far more helpful. It shows basic arm positions and has a few fun drills to help the kids memorize them. This is fun DVD with peppy people that is fun to watch. My 7th grade daughter made the squad for next year with help of this DVD. It doesn't cover jumps, which might be helpful, but it was still better than the other one.

1883965,4,B00009L507,"I purchased this video for my cheerleading squad at a middle school.  I was able to teach the class the dance on it, and the girls loved it.  The girls are getting better at it.  I did not think that the dance would be easy, but they managed to pick it up and they are excited.",1234396800,,277,3.9107142857142856

1883967,4,B00009L507,"I am a coach for a church and my girls are PreK-5th Grade.  I was looking for some new material that wasn't too advanced for them.  This DVD is pretty good.  There are a couple of chants and cheers, but only 1 dance.  The dance is pretty simple, however I did have to change a couple of movements sice we are a church.  Overall, it's pretty good and the break-down of the chants, cheers and dance were a huge help!",1217808000,,414,4.125
