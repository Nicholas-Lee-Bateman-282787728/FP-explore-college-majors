3129617,4,B0014D5QRE,"I watched this on Cablevision's Free On Demand service.  When it first started, I expected to watch maybe half an hour and then turn it off and was glad I didn't.  This is a story of early 50s childhood and a very innocent time period.  It was considered to be safe enough for young children to ride the subways alone, and especially to Coney Island during the summer.  No worries about perverts and predators lurking about then.  Lennie Norton and his little brother Joey actually play outdoors with other neighborhood kids.  They play ball, read comic books and with cap guns.  One day Lennie and his pals decide to play a trick on Joey and convince him that he 'killed' Lennie after he 'shoots' him with a toy rifle.  Lennie has planted some ketchup under his t-shirt and is lying with 'blood' on his chest and little Joey is convinced by the older boys that he has killed his brother.  They tell him he'd better hide out until things cool off.  Panic stricken, Joey runs back to their apartment and hides out in the closet until he decides to run away.  He takes the money that their mother left by the telephone(she had to go for an overnight stay out of town)and takes the train straight to Coney Island.  Once he arrives, he has himself quite an adventure with the $6 he has in his pocket.  Let me tell you, $6 went a long way for a kid back in those days.  Joey goes on a few rides, plays a few game of chance stands, and stuffs himself at various times with hot dogs, cotton candy, soda and a huge slice of watermelon.  I thought for sure he would wind up with a really bad stomachache, but he was fine.  You will laugh when you see Joey have his picture taken on the boardwalk with a cardboard cutout of a cowboy.  Joey then moves on to wander around the crowded beach and notices another little boy walking around picking up empty soda bottles.  He asks this boy what he's doing and he shows him where to trade them in for deposit.  He decides he likes doing this for the extra money and makes several return trips to the counter man who kindly hands over the change to Joey each time.  Then he goes on to the pony rides.  It is made clear from the beginning of this film that Joey is a huge fan of horses.  He makes friends with the man who puts him on a pony and chats with him as they romp around the little track.  After doing this for awhile, it starts to get dark and you wonder if this little guy will put himself back on the subway home.  Surprisingly, he is shown waking up from a deep sleep underneath the boardwalk, completely alone.  Imagine a kid doing that now!  Anyway, I have rambled on long enough.  Suffice it to say the movie does have a happy ending.  Check it out for yourself.  Some of you will find this slow and boring, others who are of the baby boom generation will find it to be a very fine film of days long gone by.",1452988800,,2855,4.244897959183674

3129646,5,B0014D5QRE,"For photographer Morris Engel, covering life was his job.  As a combat photographer during World War II and an active Photo League member, he and his girlfriend at the time, fellow professional photographer Ruth Orkin (best known for her photo ""American Girl in Italy"") and colleague, writer Raymond Abrashkin (who would go on to co-create/write the popular sci-fi series ""Danny Dunn""), decided to create their own film titled ""Little Fugitive"".

Created for only $30,000 with normal people as actors and shot on location in New York and a custom-made concealed strap-on 35 mm camera in Coney Island, ""Little Fugitive"" was created and would receive critical acclaim.  And the creation of his own camera for filming would inspire other filmmakers to create their own cameras.

Even legendary French New Wave filmmaker Francois Truffaut has credited ""Little Fugitive"" as an inspiration to his 1959 masterpiece ""The 400 Blows"" and saying, ""Our New Wave would never have come into being if it hadn't been for the young American Morris Engel, who showed us the way to independent production with this fine movie.""

Considered as one of the most successful American independent films, ""Little fugitive"" would receive an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Writing, Motion Picture Story"" and a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

In 1997, ""Little Fugitive"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

In 2008, Kino released the Morris Engel box set which included his films ""Little Fugitive"", ""Lovers and Lollipops"" and ""Weddings and Babies"".  And on March 2013, ""Little Fugitive"" received a Blu-ray release with the film mastered in HD from a 35 mm print preserved by the Museum of Modern Art with support from The Film Foundation, The National Endowment for the Arts and the Celeste Bartos Fund for Film Preservation.

VIDEO:

""Little Fugitive"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and in black and white.  It's important to remember that ""Little Fugitive"" is a low budget film that was made was a custom-made 35 mm camera that had its own issues during filming.

Having owned the previous DVD release from Kino, the main differences you will see is more detail and better contrast of whites and grays with better black levels.  While the original print has not been cleaned up of its white specks, I'm not sure if the original print was even possible to have been cleaned of its imperfections but still, the picture quality is an improvement over its DVD counterpart.  The film is mastered in HD from a 35 mm print preserved by the Museum of Modern Art with support from The Film Foundation, The National Endowment for the Arts and the Celeste Bartos Fund for Film Preservation.

For the most part, picture quality is very good, much better detail on the Blu-ray release as one would expect.  The DVD also had some color fluctuations and was slightly darker but picture quality is definitely improved in this Blu-ray release.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Little Fugitive""is presented in LPCM 2.0 mono.  It's important to note that the film was shot and dialogue added later.  Dialogue and music is clear.  There is no noticeable hiss or pops during my viewing of the film.  There are no English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Little Fugitive"" features the following special features:

  Audio Commentary by Morris Engel - An insightful audio commentary by Morris Engel discussing the making of the film.
  Morris Engel: The Independent - (28:38) Featuring a 2008 documentary by Mary Engel about her father.  Featuring his life and professional career with video of her father.
  Ruth Orkin: Frames of Life - (18:19) A 1995 documentary featuring the work of Ruth Orkin and audio featuring Ruth discussing her work.
  Theatrical Trailer - (1:52) The original theatrical trailer for ""Little Fugitive"".
  Image Gallery - Featuring 16 images of promotional artwork to movie stills.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I was a teenager, I used to watch ""Little Fugitive"" on cable television. Having searched for the film, after forgetting the title, by the time I would rediscover ""Little Fugitive"", I was already in my 30s.

With a big interest in French Nouvelle Vague and the work of Francois Truffaut, during my research one day about American independent films, I would discover a quote from Truffaut about a film titled ""Little Fugitive"" and how the film inspired him to create his independent masterpiece ""The 400 Blows"".

Suffice to say, I was overjoyed to find out that the little boy who was in Coney Island turned out to be ""Little Fugitive"" and it has been one of my favorite releases from Kino and now this wonderful film has been released on Blu-ray.

I absolutely loved ""Little Fugitive"" as it not only captured the innocence of a child, but also the adventure through Coney Island, capturing on camera, the excitement of the area of that time.

While Coney Island has been marred through controversy and many discussions of revitalizing the area, while its heyday was before the 1940s, ""Little Fugitive"" would still capture the amusement park in its glory before going through significant changes in the '60s.

But the charm of the film is not just about capturing the heyday, but seeing Coney Island through the eyes of a seven-year-old boy.  Yes, the film had a script and was carefully planned out, but its the ability to capture this natural feeling of a boy just enjoying his time at Coney Island and not acting as if he was in a film.

The film was also inspiring because filmmaker and cinematographer Morris Engel utilized a concealed 35 mm camera.  I've seen concealed cameras used in French and Italian films but to see it employed in an American independent film and many people from Coney Island not knowing they are in the film, I thought that was pretty amazing, especially how he captured young actor Richie Andrusco, who seemed to have forgotten about the camera and just being a normal boy, the character of Joey now becoming real to viewer as the experiences were natural and felt real.

But this was guerrilla filmmaking on a budget and it's amazing to see how much was captured and done for $35,000.  Watching it now, you can't help but be impressed.

As for the Blu-ray release, the special features are the same as the previous DVD.  So, there is nothing new added.  But with that being said, I know with this Blu-ray release, many fans will be introduced to Morris Engel's work for the first time through ""Little Fugitive"".

The audio commentary with Morris Engel was recorded before his death in 2005 and the commentary is just full of interesting facts.  From how it was to work with the young Richie Andrusco and how he captured his personality for Joey with no need for direction, how the rifle scene was actually using a real rifle and Morris was terrified of filming that scene, how the drowning scene was real (and an explanation of why it was cut out of the TV version) and how Lennie's line ""You're laying on my pants"" was censored by the state of Ohio and much more.

The documentary ""Morris Engel: The Independent"" is also impressive as we see Engel reuniting with his young star Richie Andrusco many decades later, we see Engel's career featured to celebrate his career, but also to celebrate his life years after his death.  The same can be said for ""Ruth Orkin: Frames of Life"" which showcases the career of Ruth Orkin in a smaller 18 minute featurette.

As mentioned earlier, the Blu-ray does feature much better contrast and detail over its DVD counterpart.

Overall, ""Little Fugitive"" is one of those magical classics that you simply love because it captured American innocence.  It captured the real actions of people at Coney Island and it also caught a glimpse of that Coney Island magic that no longer exists.  But it's also a wonderful American independent film that was inspiring to filmmakers because it showed how one can create a film, with not much money but yet have an impact on viewers all over the world.

Delightful, entertaining and wonderful, Morris Engel's ""Little Fugitive"" is highly recommended!",1372896000,,8193,4.937226277372263
3129647,5,B0014D5QRE,"""The Little Fugitive""  is both a landmark of independent American cinema and a document of 1950's Brooklyn.  When Joey (Richie Andrusco) is tricked into believing he killed his older brother, he gathers his meager possessions and flees to Coney Island.  As he wanders the boardwalk, beach, and amusement area and its fascinating attractions, Joey experiences a day and night filled with adventures and mysteries.

This is an absolutely delightful film.  Shot entirely from the point of view of a seven-year-old, it captures his fascination with the fabulous honky-tonk world of parachute jump, carousels, and pony rides in a bustling Coney Island at the height of its popularity.  The hundreds of ""extras"" in the movie are real people and young Mr. Andrusco turns in a perfectly natural performance as he gets cotton candy stuck all over his face, collects bottles and turns them in for their deposit, and explores the mysteries of what lies beneath the boardwalk.

3129649,5,B0014D5QRE,"This film is an early classic of American independent cinema.  I first saw it approximately 45-50 years ago and it has stuck with me as few other movies have.  The only other film that has affected me in the same manner is ""The Red Balloon"", another film that has been a part of my subconscious since the mid-1950's.  They are both totally unaffected portraits of childhood as seen through the eyes of their young protagonists.  ""Little Fugitive"" is also a moment frozen in time, a portrait of Coney Island as it was and shall never be again.  If you have not yet seen it, please do!",1349395200,,583,4.462264150943396
3129650,5,B0014D5QRE,"I first saw Morris Engel's ""Little Fugitive"" when I was a kid. I don't remember the circumstances of the viewing, and over time I forgot the actual name of the movie. But it stayed with me all the same. The simple story of a scared little boy fleeing to Coney Island, because he thinks he killed his older brother, who'd just pulled a rotten trick on the kid. I'd describe the movie to other film lovers but never got back more than a shrug or a shake of the head. Then one night I'm watching TCM, listening to Robert Osbourne talk about this independent filmmaker in New York named Morris Engel, and how he made movies on the cheap in his hometown of NYC and its outlying boroughs--in this case, Coney Island. Immediately my ears perked up. Then Osborne goes on to describe this little unknown actor named Richie Andrusco, a Opie Taylor lookalike, who wowed audiences who were lucky enough to see this film in its limited release. I knew I had finally come across that childhood treasure again! But unlike most childhood treasures, which lose their luster over the years, this treasure still glittered and glowed. The locales are authentic and enchanting. Morris Engel didn't sweep the street before shooting, or pick up around the 50's era apartment; no, he left all the trash and awkward bystanders in place. Making this one of the most authentic looking movies I've ever seen. The production values may be cheap, the acting at times amateurish, but that's part of the ""authentic"" charm going on here. But it's the performance he gets out of the 7-year-old Andrusco that really makes this movie so special. It's as if Engel was just following little Joey around town, his camera and crew hidden from view, filming the boy as he made his way through the once great Coney Island. Helpless at home, little Joey becomes resilient and resourceful at Coney, redeeming empty pop bottles for spending money. Money he spends in great quantities at the Pony Ride concession, where he befriends the horse handler there. Thankfully, no harm befalls the kid, and his older brother, seeing the error of his ways, finds Joey before their mother comes home to find them both missing. The dialogue is kept to a minimum, but you'll never miss it, entranced as you'll be by the backdrop of Coney Island and the kid who for a time inhabits it. I envy you the experience.",1347667200,,2353,4.685990338164252
3129651,5,B0014D5QRE,"I am surprised that someone found it to be worthy of one star. Well, I guess we all have our choices. Anyway, it's one of the best movies--not because of any technical magic, but solely because of the unique story-telling style. Cinematography was great, and the child actors were simply good. It's touching, and the central character--the little boy Joey provoked affection throughout the duration. You will enjoy it--just have some patience though. It's a simple movie.",1334793600,,471,5.12987012987013
3129652,4,B0014D5QRE,"""The Little Fugitive"" a low budget film, shot during 1952 on-location of Coney Island's Beach. The actors intermingled with the crowd and became an integrated part of the unplanned or documentary events that took place on the beach that day. The beach was overcrowded with visitors that came to enjoy a weekend summer day at the seashore. While shooting, unplanned undirected drowning and rescue occurred; it became one of the most stunning dramatic moments of the film. The unplanned events included in the movie intensified the authentic naturalistic atmosphere. This documentary-like style reminds me of the memorable Italian masterpieces: ""Bicycle Thief"" directed by Vittorio De Sica, ""La Strada"" and ""Nights of Cabiria"" directed by Federico Fellini. Morris Engel's picture shines with excellence, in the same row with these Italian masterpieces

The protagonist a 7-year-old boy, portrayed by Ritchie Andrusco, a cute boy, who isn't a professional actor, mistakenly thought that he killed his own brother; ran away and became a little fugitive in Coney Island. Being loose in a heavenly kid's paradise he feasted and gorged without adult's interference. The director-photographer Morris Engel let the boy act and react naturally as a 7-year-old would in similar situations; which further intensified the documentary naturalistic style of this movie.
.
It turned out that the low budget, apparently a limiting factor, became a direct contributor to the film's atmosphere and uniqueness. The artistic photography by a cheaper and less sophisticated 35mm movie-camera and using a B & W film creates a stunning interplay between lights and silhouettes. People photographed from uncommon angles convey an intimate and touching simplicity of humanity; as does the engaging background music played by a single and modest musical instrument a harmonica.
This is one of the best movies I've seen lately.
However, this cinematographic masterpiece left me somewhat in frustration. It's against my logic to accept that a kid, who is sure that he just killed his brother, goes on a carefree entertaining spree, as if nothing has happened. The writer -director could have easily find other reasons/situation to set the boy at Coney Island's Beach, hence reduced to 4 stars.",1331942400,,2264,5.395480225988701
3129653,5,B0014D5QRE,"This film was particularly enjoyed by me because of the time frame. I grew up in similar conditions before I was 9 years old, so I felt a bondage between me and the boy at Coney Island. I was familiar with the ""L"" as it was similar to Chicago in the 1930's.

3129656,5,B0014D5QRE,"Just got through watching a DVD set called The Films of Morris Engel, to re-watch one of my all-time favorites and enjoy the other two in the ""series."" It was also nice to share these with my family. Engel was a renowned a WWII and candid ""slice of life"" photographer who decided to capture the same kind of little moments of New York City life he had in his photography in a feature film (apparently despite the best advice of friends and ""experts"").

The resulting feature, Little Fugitive, is a powerhouse in its simple and evocative capture of '50s New York, particularly Coney Island. It went from a film nobody seemed to want to one of the most acclaimed independent films of all time, cited by Francois Truffaut as a conduit for French new wave cinema and added to the National Film Registry.

Disney connection: the film was cowritten by Raymond Abraskin, who with Jay Williams (also played the pony ride man), wrote the ""Danny Dunn"" books, which are credited on Son of Flubber. Also, look for Will Lee -- the beloved Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street -- as a photographer.

Engel provides a delightful, wry commentary on his landmark work, along with video features by Mary Engel, daughter of the director and his wife, Fugitive editor Ruth Orkin.

Orkin directed the ""female version"" of Little Fugitive, a romantic dramedy called Lovers and Lollipops. Now a grownup story is added to the antics of a small girl, the musical score is more than a solo harmonica (but still supplied by session musician and children's record artist Eddy Manson). Playing an unlikely make romantic lead is Gerald O'Loughlin, best known as the crusty but benign chief on TV's The Rookies.

Engel (and Orkin's) last feature is Weddings and Babies, the most elaborate of the three, with a bonafide star in the lead -- the luminous Swedish actress Viveca Lindfors. Playing the male lead is again an unlikely choice: John Myhers, who you've seen on dozens of movies and TV shows usually as an administrative figure, most notably in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. His performance, though not quite as adroit as Lindfors', is touching and restrained. The story takes place in Little Italy during the festival and sizzles with authenticity.

In a modern movie marketplace blaring with special effects extravaganzas, what a refreshing change to cool down with three unpretentious gems. Sometimes a lack of budget results in special degree of creativity and ingenuity.",1312070400,,2460,4.9014423076923075

3129664,5,B0014D5QRE,"I first saw this film 15 years ago on cable TV. I bought the DVD so that my children could see it. We go to Coney Island every now and then and while it is fun, Coney Island today does not compare to the Coney Island in this film.

Coney Island has had many incarnations, always as an amusement area. And Coney Island in the summer of 1952 is the background to this charming film. In Little Fugitive the Wonder Wheel, Parachute Jump and the Horse Race and more are in their prime. Only the Wonder Wheel is still running today. The Horse Race burned down and the parachute jump tower is a derelict.

And, since the background action is not staged, the people in this film are real. When those folks--teenagers in 1952 and senior citizens today--thought about the next generation, our world is the future they contemplated.

The commentary by director Morris Engel is a primer on how to make a serious low budget feature, interesting to any film student but also to any film fan.

Engel was also the cameraman. He shot the entire thing on black and white 35mm film using a hand held camera. All of the shooting was silent with the dialog, music and effects added in a studio later.

While writing this I looked on the web to see what happened to Richie Andrusco. I found this instead: when Morris Engel died in 2005 at the age of 86, the New York Times wrote of him as ""the New York photographer and filmmaker whose 1953 film, 'The Little Fugitive,' established a model for independent moviemaking that influenced directors like John Cassavetes and Franois Truffaut...""

This non-actor kid Ritchie Andrusco is about the best actor for his age (7) I've see, or at least he ranks up there at the top.
And what little bit of talking he does do in the movie you can hear his New Yawk accent. Like when he's trying to knock down the milk bottles with the baseball at the arcade in Coney Island, and he tells the man standing next to him, hey mista, can ya move ova so I can take my shot. I'm really glad I found this DVD, now I can watch it whenever I'm in the mood. The days portrayed in this DVD are sadly long gone.

3129666,4,B0014D5QRE,"I love the documentaries that come with the Criterion boxed set and I especially admire Morris Engel for his courage in standing up to the big studios.  That said, Lovers and Lollipops isn't a great movie.  Though it may be a great work of art.  Oh what a paradox.

It is really the story of Hamlet if Hamlet was not the prince of Denmark but instead a small girl living with her mom in a charming mid-1950s Manhattan apartment.

And it is oddly similar to Francoise Sagan's Bonjour Tristesse, in which the heroine will do anything, and I mean anything, to make sure her father doesn't re-marry, and the tension is between her hatred of Deborah Kerr and her growing admiration for her, even though she has vowed to destroy her.  Her the little girl is determined to get Larry out of her life even if it means destroying her mother's main chance for a happy new life.  And yet she likes Larry and has many good times with him.  He buys her a miniature sailboat, and a dancing bear doll that claps cymbals together--from the old Macy's toy department--clever product placement of the Macy's bag.  He reads to her, jokes with her, but maybe Peggy knows that deep down he doesn't really like her and his affectionate-seeming banter is only part of his ploy to win her mother's heart.  Ann (the mother, played by Lori March) is bright enough, but in some ways she's dumb as a post.

Oh, those lollipops!  Stanley Kubrick had Lolita licking a lollipop, but little Peggy plants hers, stick down, in the sand at Jones Beach, and then washes off the sand by sticking them under the incoming waves.  No wonder Ann gets so upset with Larry!  I didn't understand exactly what it was about Larry's father.  Larry wanted Ann to meet his father but to make no mention of Peggy?  So whatever happened to that plot, it just went the way of the lollipops I guess.  The film itself remains as a great open window into a long-ago bourgeois dream of Manhattan without crime, without dirt, without race, a Jamesian New York modeled on the London of What Maisie Knew.

Weddings and Babies attempts to widen the racial paradigms of L&L by introducing the character of Bea, a nomadic lonely soul who hails from--what, Sweden I guess.  She is played by Viveka Lindfors who seems to be channeling the spirit of Anna Magnani, who was very much alive at the time and who is responsible, by her carbon copy here--well, make that a very faint 4th generation Xerox--for the link between the Engel-Orkin films and the original neo-realismo of De Sica and Rossellini.",1241481600,,2533,4.588888888888889
3129667,4,B0014D5QRE,"Little Fugitive is an independent movie that has a creative storyline and the acting, all done by people new to movie making, is excellent. The plot moves along well at the beginning but it does slow down a bit too much for the main portion of the film. However, the cinematography is great, Morris Engel's camera technique works wonders for this film--he had a 35mm camera strapped to his chest to film most of this picture! In addition, the choreography works well in the scuffle scene between two of the older boys as well as the scenes inside the apartment where the Nortons live.

When the action starts, we meet some young boys who want to play even though they're a bit cranky and tired of playing the same old games day in and day out in their Brooklyn, New York City neighborhood. Lennie Norton (Richard Brewster) likes to tease his younger brother Joey (Richie Andrusco); and Lennie's friends Harry (Charlie Moss) and Charley (Tommy DeCanio) don't like Joey too much, either.

One day, Lennie and Joey discover that their mother (Winifred Cushing) has to spend the weekend away visiting their sick grandmother. Their mother tells Lennie to take care of Joey; when Lennie protests that he wants to go to Coney Island for his birthday their mother says he's have to go another time. This really gets the tension up between Joey and Lennie.

However, Lennie has a plan--with the help of his friends Harry and Charley. They trick Joey into thinking that he accidentally killed Lennie with a ""real"" bullet in a ""real"" gun; and Harry tells Joey to ""beat it"" before the cops come for him! Joey falls for this because he is a rather young and impressionable child; and he flees with a few things of his and goes for a subway ride. Where does Joey end up? Coney Island!

The scenes filmed at Coney Island are very well done and it does indeed give this film a documentary flavor. I do wish, however, that the plot moved a bit quicker at this point; and the plot could have been improved even more by the introduction of another young child. Yes, Joey meets another kid who teaches him how to collect bottles to get the nickel deposits back; but it still doesn't give me enough material to truly satisfy me.

And of course, the plot could go anywhere from here. Does Lennie ever find out where his brother his? How will the pony-ride man Jay (Jay Williams) figure into all this? Will Lennie go to a cop to help him find Joey? How will Joey manage on his own at Coney Island? Watch and find out!

The DVD comes with two documentary short features; and I really liked the footage in this film of Coney Island and Brooklyn from back in the day. As a native New Yorker, that was great to watch.

Overall, Little Fugitive is a good motion picture despite the fact that it suffers a bit from a plot that moves too slowly for the main portion of the picture. Nevertheless, I recommend this film for people who like independent film; and people who enjoy footage of what New York's Brooklyn and Coney Island looked like way back when will also enjoy this film.",1240617600,,3052,4.528130671506352
3129668,4,B0014D5QRE,"Talk about a movie with a different feel to it!

It looks like a home movie with real people, not actors. Actually, it almost is that, as these were new actors filmed by new filmmaker managing on a threadbare budget.

The little boy in the film, Richie Andrusco, was the central character and he had never acted before and has never acted after this film! No wonder he looked so ""real."" Most of the people in the film - at least in the background - were real people, not actors, so you really get a feel of being in New York City and Coney Island in particular in the mid 1950s.

The story is a simple one, about a kid who thought he killed his brother and runs away, spending a night and two days at Coney Island. It shows how a kid that age probably would spend his time at this place. You almost have to fast-forward through a couple of scenes as they go on too long, such as the boy picking up bottles to return for cash.

Also, it's very interesting that a hand held camera was used especially back in those days.  Coney Island buffs will enjoy seeing the park when it really was an amusement park.  Today's Coney Island pales in comparison.  Even I, who thought I knew everything there was to know about Coney Island, never knew that there were places under the boardwalk where you could return soda bottles.

I recomend this film to anyone with young children, as it's an excellent study of boys & how they relate to each other & the pranks that can get them into trouble. Fortunately, this film has a very happy ending, & the best part is that their mom never suspects anything unusual happened while she was away visiting her ill sister.

3129680,5,B0014D5QRE,"Though this film is certainly not for all tastes, I have to say that it's definitely one of my all time favorites.  I strongly recall watching it on PBS late at night as a child, and was overjoyed to rediscover it as an adult.  It doesn't hurt at all, either, that I'm a HUGE fan of Coney Island history, and that this film is chock-full of 1953 footage of the park, back in the good ol' days.

The plot is incredibly simple - a young boy is tricked by his older brother and latter's unkind friends, into believing that he's committed murder.  The boy runs off to Coney Island to take it on the lam, and, while there, learns a whole lot about the world.  From finding out about the glory of 5-cent deposits, to (finally) riding a real pony, we see what's important in his little life, and see how he ekes out a survival for himself during his day and night away from home.

There is hardly any dialogue once he's in the park, and it's refreshing, really - almost a sensory experience through the eyes of a little boy.  We are treated to a more innocent time - with very little effort, one can smell the odors of the boardwalk, taste the sweetness of a watermelon slice, and feel the sand beneath the feet.  I haven't seen another film quite like this - it's truly magical.

For the Coney Island enthusiasts out there, the footage from the park is fantastic.  It stands as a wonderful record of the past - the parachute jump, batting cages, food stands, a marvelous carousel, souvenir booths...it's all here, and it's incredible.  If you haven't seen this film, you're missing out, and then some.

Overall, I can admit that this film isn't for all folks - it's slow-moving, quiet, and can drag along a bit - if you don't surrender to it, and take it at it's own pace.  Once you've done so, however, you'll see how great a film it really is.",1082678400,,1839,4.357771260997067

Several years ago when visiting NYC with my own children, after spending a day in Coney Island, eating at Nathans and going on the Cyclone, we wandered into a Manhatten video store and I was astounded to see it on a shelf.

3129682,4,B0014D5QRE,"I am of an age with the ""Joey"" portrayed in this movie and used to hang around in Coney Island of the era, albeit a little later (1957 vs. 1953).
Coney Island in the '50s was a faded resort. Its streets and back alleys contained the ghosts and survivals of a more vibrant era. What makes this movie remarkable is the extent to which it captures not only the appearance of the area but the way it FELT for a young kid encountering its sights and people. I cannot find a single wrong note or unfamiliar or contrieved situation, at least so far as Coney itself is concerned.
Unfortunately, the plot is so thin that it might have been better to dispense with it altogether, though I suppose it was necessary, especially in the '50s, to explain why an eight-year-old was wandering unescorted through a sometimes dangerous area.
I won't quibble about the plot too much. I am grateful that, just like some of the silly old silent comedies that gave us glimpses of Luna Park and other disappeared pieces of history, future generations get a chance to ""walk"" through another era with a minimum of affectation or interpretation.
I was moved not to give five stars as I believe the extra star would only have been expressing my nostalgia. For the film alone I might have been inclined to give it three, but more knowledgeable people than I attest that this was a groundbreaking film, so ""four"" seems just about right.",1037145600,,1406,4.583333333333333

I also imagined my Dad watching this movie and saying things like, ""I remember that type of..."" .  So, if you were a kid during this generation you probably would be very nostalgic.  I learned a lot about how life would be as a boy during the 50's--the director didn't hype it up with a lot of drama--just a nice capture of certain moments.

3364114,4,B0014D5QRE,"I watched this on Cablevision's Free On Demand service.  When it first started, I expected to watch maybe half an hour and then turn it off and was glad I didn't.  This is a story of early 50s childhood and a very innocent time period.  It was considered to be safe enough for young children to ride the subways alone, and especially to Coney Island during the summer.  No worries about perverts and predators lurking about then.  Lennie Norton and his little brother Joey actually play outdoors with other neighborhood kids.  They play ball, read comic books and with cap guns.  One day Lennie and his pals decide to play a trick on Joey and convince him that he 'killed' Lennie after he 'shoots' him with a toy rifle.  Lennie has planted some ketchup under his t-shirt and is lying with 'blood' on his chest and little Joey is convinced by the older boys that he has killed his brother.  They tell him he'd better hide out until things cool off.  Panic stricken, Joey runs back to their apartment and hides out in the closet until he decides to run away.  He takes the money that their mother left by the telephone(she had to go for an overnight stay out of town)and takes the train straight to Coney Island.  Once he arrives, he has himself quite an adventure with the $6 he has in his pocket.  Let me tell you, $6 went a long way for a kid back in those days.  Joey goes on a few rides, plays a few game of chance stands, and stuffs himself at various times with hot dogs, cotton candy, soda and a huge slice of watermelon.  I thought for sure he would wind up with a really bad stomachache, but he was fine.  You will laugh when you see Joey have his picture taken on the boardwalk with a cardboard cutout of a cowboy.  Joey then moves on to wander around the crowded beach and notices another little boy walking around picking up empty soda bottles.  He asks this boy what he's doing and he shows him where to trade them in for deposit.  He decides he likes doing this for the extra money and makes several return trips to the counter man who kindly hands over the change to Joey each time.  Then he goes on to the pony rides.  It is made clear from the beginning of this film that Joey is a huge fan of horses.  He makes friends with the man who puts him on a pony and chats with him as they romp around the little track.  After doing this for awhile, it starts to get dark and you wonder if this little guy will put himself back on the subway home.  Surprisingly, he is shown waking up from a deep sleep underneath the boardwalk, completely alone.  Imagine a kid doing that now!  Anyway, I have rambled on long enough.  Suffice it to say the movie does have a happy ending.  Check it out for yourself.  Some of you will find this slow and boring, others who are of the baby boom generation will find it to be a very fine film of days long gone by.",1452988800,,2855,4.244897959183674

3364143,5,B0014D5QRE,"For photographer Morris Engel, covering life was his job.  As a combat photographer during World War II and an active Photo League member, he and his girlfriend at the time, fellow professional photographer Ruth Orkin (best known for her photo ""American Girl in Italy"") and colleague, writer Raymond Abrashkin (who would go on to co-create/write the popular sci-fi series ""Danny Dunn""), decided to create their own film titled ""Little Fugitive"".

Created for only $30,000 with normal people as actors and shot on location in New York and a custom-made concealed strap-on 35 mm camera in Coney Island, ""Little Fugitive"" was created and would receive critical acclaim.  And the creation of his own camera for filming would inspire other filmmakers to create their own cameras.

Even legendary French New Wave filmmaker Francois Truffaut has credited ""Little Fugitive"" as an inspiration to his 1959 masterpiece ""The 400 Blows"" and saying, ""Our New Wave would never have come into being if it hadn't been for the young American Morris Engel, who showed us the way to independent production with this fine movie.""

Considered as one of the most successful American independent films, ""Little fugitive"" would receive an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Writing, Motion Picture Story"" and a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

In 1997, ""Little Fugitive"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

In 2008, Kino released the Morris Engel box set which included his films ""Little Fugitive"", ""Lovers and Lollipops"" and ""Weddings and Babies"".  And on March 2013, ""Little Fugitive"" received a Blu-ray release with the film mastered in HD from a 35 mm print preserved by the Museum of Modern Art with support from The Film Foundation, The National Endowment for the Arts and the Celeste Bartos Fund for Film Preservation.

VIDEO:

""Little Fugitive"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and in black and white.  It's important to remember that ""Little Fugitive"" is a low budget film that was made was a custom-made 35 mm camera that had its own issues during filming.

Having owned the previous DVD release from Kino, the main differences you will see is more detail and better contrast of whites and grays with better black levels.  While the original print has not been cleaned up of its white specks, I'm not sure if the original print was even possible to have been cleaned of its imperfections but still, the picture quality is an improvement over its DVD counterpart.  The film is mastered in HD from a 35 mm print preserved by the Museum of Modern Art with support from The Film Foundation, The National Endowment for the Arts and the Celeste Bartos Fund for Film Preservation.

For the most part, picture quality is very good, much better detail on the Blu-ray release as one would expect.  The DVD also had some color fluctuations and was slightly darker but picture quality is definitely improved in this Blu-ray release.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Little Fugitive""is presented in LPCM 2.0 mono.  It's important to note that the film was shot and dialogue added later.  Dialogue and music is clear.  There is no noticeable hiss or pops during my viewing of the film.  There are no English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Little Fugitive"" features the following special features:

  Audio Commentary by Morris Engel - An insightful audio commentary by Morris Engel discussing the making of the film.
  Morris Engel: The Independent - (28:38) Featuring a 2008 documentary by Mary Engel about her father.  Featuring his life and professional career with video of her father.
  Ruth Orkin: Frames of Life - (18:19) A 1995 documentary featuring the work of Ruth Orkin and audio featuring Ruth discussing her work.
  Theatrical Trailer - (1:52) The original theatrical trailer for ""Little Fugitive"".
  Image Gallery - Featuring 16 images of promotional artwork to movie stills.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I was a teenager, I used to watch ""Little Fugitive"" on cable television. Having searched for the film, after forgetting the title, by the time I would rediscover ""Little Fugitive"", I was already in my 30s.

With a big interest in French Nouvelle Vague and the work of Francois Truffaut, during my research one day about American independent films, I would discover a quote from Truffaut about a film titled ""Little Fugitive"" and how the film inspired him to create his independent masterpiece ""The 400 Blows"".

Suffice to say, I was overjoyed to find out that the little boy who was in Coney Island turned out to be ""Little Fugitive"" and it has been one of my favorite releases from Kino and now this wonderful film has been released on Blu-ray.

I absolutely loved ""Little Fugitive"" as it not only captured the innocence of a child, but also the adventure through Coney Island, capturing on camera, the excitement of the area of that time.

While Coney Island has been marred through controversy and many discussions of revitalizing the area, while its heyday was before the 1940s, ""Little Fugitive"" would still capture the amusement park in its glory before going through significant changes in the '60s.

But the charm of the film is not just about capturing the heyday, but seeing Coney Island through the eyes of a seven-year-old boy.  Yes, the film had a script and was carefully planned out, but its the ability to capture this natural feeling of a boy just enjoying his time at Coney Island and not acting as if he was in a film.

The film was also inspiring because filmmaker and cinematographer Morris Engel utilized a concealed 35 mm camera.  I've seen concealed cameras used in French and Italian films but to see it employed in an American independent film and many people from Coney Island not knowing they are in the film, I thought that was pretty amazing, especially how he captured young actor Richie Andrusco, who seemed to have forgotten about the camera and just being a normal boy, the character of Joey now becoming real to viewer as the experiences were natural and felt real.

But this was guerrilla filmmaking on a budget and it's amazing to see how much was captured and done for $35,000.  Watching it now, you can't help but be impressed.

As for the Blu-ray release, the special features are the same as the previous DVD.  So, there is nothing new added.  But with that being said, I know with this Blu-ray release, many fans will be introduced to Morris Engel's work for the first time through ""Little Fugitive"".

The audio commentary with Morris Engel was recorded before his death in 2005 and the commentary is just full of interesting facts.  From how it was to work with the young Richie Andrusco and how he captured his personality for Joey with no need for direction, how the rifle scene was actually using a real rifle and Morris was terrified of filming that scene, how the drowning scene was real (and an explanation of why it was cut out of the TV version) and how Lennie's line ""You're laying on my pants"" was censored by the state of Ohio and much more.

The documentary ""Morris Engel: The Independent"" is also impressive as we see Engel reuniting with his young star Richie Andrusco many decades later, we see Engel's career featured to celebrate his career, but also to celebrate his life years after his death.  The same can be said for ""Ruth Orkin: Frames of Life"" which showcases the career of Ruth Orkin in a smaller 18 minute featurette.

As mentioned earlier, the Blu-ray does feature much better contrast and detail over its DVD counterpart.

Overall, ""Little Fugitive"" is one of those magical classics that you simply love because it captured American innocence.  It captured the real actions of people at Coney Island and it also caught a glimpse of that Coney Island magic that no longer exists.  But it's also a wonderful American independent film that was inspiring to filmmakers because it showed how one can create a film, with not much money but yet have an impact on viewers all over the world.

Delightful, entertaining and wonderful, Morris Engel's ""Little Fugitive"" is highly recommended!",1372896000,,8193,4.937226277372263
3364144,5,B0014D5QRE,"""The Little Fugitive""  is both a landmark of independent American cinema and a document of 1950's Brooklyn.  When Joey (Richie Andrusco) is tricked into believing he killed his older brother, he gathers his meager possessions and flees to Coney Island.  As he wanders the boardwalk, beach, and amusement area and its fascinating attractions, Joey experiences a day and night filled with adventures and mysteries.

This is an absolutely delightful film.  Shot entirely from the point of view of a seven-year-old, it captures his fascination with the fabulous honky-tonk world of parachute jump, carousels, and pony rides in a bustling Coney Island at the height of its popularity.  The hundreds of ""extras"" in the movie are real people and young Mr. Andrusco turns in a perfectly natural performance as he gets cotton candy stuck all over his face, collects bottles and turns them in for their deposit, and explores the mysteries of what lies beneath the boardwalk.

3364147,5,B0014D5QRE,"I first saw Morris Engel's ""Little Fugitive"" when I was a kid. I don't remember the circumstances of the viewing, and over time I forgot the actual name of the movie. But it stayed with me all the same. The simple story of a scared little boy fleeing to Coney Island, because he thinks he killed his older brother, who'd just pulled a rotten trick on the kid. I'd describe the movie to other film lovers but never got back more than a shrug or a shake of the head. Then one night I'm watching TCM, listening to Robert Osbourne talk about this independent filmmaker in New York named Morris Engel, and how he made movies on the cheap in his hometown of NYC and its outlying boroughs--in this case, Coney Island. Immediately my ears perked up. Then Osborne goes on to describe this little unknown actor named Richie Andrusco, a Opie Taylor lookalike, who wowed audiences who were lucky enough to see this film in its limited release. I knew I had finally come across that childhood treasure again! But unlike most childhood treasures, which lose their luster over the years, this treasure still glittered and glowed. The locales are authentic and enchanting. Morris Engel didn't sweep the street before shooting, or pick up around the 50's era apartment; no, he left all the trash and awkward bystanders in place. Making this one of the most authentic looking movies I've ever seen. The production values may be cheap, the acting at times amateurish, but that's part of the ""authentic"" charm going on here. But it's the performance he gets out of the 7-year-old Andrusco that really makes this movie so special. It's as if Engel was just following little Joey around town, his camera and crew hidden from view, filming the boy as he made his way through the once great Coney Island. Helpless at home, little Joey becomes resilient and resourceful at Coney, redeeming empty pop bottles for spending money. Money he spends in great quantities at the Pony Ride concession, where he befriends the horse handler there. Thankfully, no harm befalls the kid, and his older brother, seeing the error of his ways, finds Joey before their mother comes home to find them both missing. The dialogue is kept to a minimum, but you'll never miss it, entranced as you'll be by the backdrop of Coney Island and the kid who for a time inhabits it. I envy you the experience.",1347667200,,2353,4.685990338164252

It's touching, and the central character--the little boy Joey provoked affection throughout the duration. You will enjoy it--just have some patience though. It's a simple movie.",1334793600,,471,5.12987012987013
3364149,4,B0014D5QRE,"""The Little Fugitive"" a low budget film, shot during 1952 on-location of Coney Island's Beach. The actors intermingled with the crowd and became an integrated part of the unplanned or documentary events that took place on the beach that day. The beach was overcrowded with visitors that came to enjoy a weekend summer day at the seashore. While shooting, unplanned undirected drowning and rescue occurred; it became one of the most stunning dramatic moments of the film. The unplanned events included in the movie intensified the authentic naturalistic atmosphere. This documentary-like style reminds me of the memorable Italian masterpieces: ""Bicycle Thief"" directed by Vittorio De Sica, ""La Strada"" and ""Nights of Cabiria"" directed by Federico Fellini. Morris Engel's picture shines with excellence, in the same row with these Italian masterpieces

The protagonist a 7-year-old boy, portrayed by Ritchie Andrusco, a cute boy, who isn't a professional actor, mistakenly thought that he killed his own brother; ran away and became a little fugitive in Coney Island. Being loose in a heavenly kid's paradise he feasted and gorged without adult's interference. The director-photographer Morris Engel let the boy act and react naturally as a 7-year-old would in similar situations; which further intensified the documentary naturalistic style of this movie.
.
It turned out that the low budget, apparently a limiting factor, became a direct contributor to the film's atmosphere and uniqueness. The artistic photography by a cheaper and less sophisticated 35mm movie-camera and using a B & W film creates a stunning interplay between lights and silhouettes. People photographed from uncommon angles convey an intimate and touching simplicity of humanity; as does the engaging background music played by a single and modest musical instrument a harmonica.
This is one of the best movies I've seen lately.
However, this cinematographic masterpiece left me somewhat in frustration. It's against my logic to accept that a kid, who is sure that he just killed his brother, goes on a carefree entertaining spree, as if nothing has happened. The writer -director could have easily find other reasons/situation to set the boy at Coney Island's Beach, hence reduced to 4 stars.",1331942400,,2264,5.395480225988701

3364153,5,B0014D5QRE,"Just got through watching a DVD set called The Films of Morris Engel, to re-watch one of my all-time favorites and enjoy the other two in the ""series."" It was also nice to share these with my family. Engel was a renowned a WWII and candid ""slice of life"" photographer who decided to capture the same kind of little moments of New York City life he had in his photography in a feature film (apparently despite the best advice of friends and ""experts"").

The resulting feature, Little Fugitive, is a powerhouse in its simple and evocative capture of '50s New York, particularly Coney Island. It went from a film nobody seemed to want to one of the most acclaimed independent films of all time, cited by Francois Truffaut as a conduit for French new wave cinema and added to the National Film Registry.

Disney connection: the film was cowritten by Raymond Abraskin, who with Jay Williams (also played the pony ride man), wrote the ""Danny Dunn"" books, which are credited on Son of Flubber. Also, look for Will Lee -- the beloved Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street -- as a photographer.

Engel provides a delightful, wry commentary on his landmark work, along with video features by Mary Engel, daughter of the director and his wife, Fugitive editor Ruth Orkin.

Orkin directed the ""female version"" of Little Fugitive, a romantic dramedy called Lovers and Lollipops. Now a grownup story is added to the antics of a small girl, the musical score is more than a solo harmonica (but still supplied by session musician and children's record artist Eddy Manson). Playing an unlikely make romantic lead is Gerald O'Loughlin, best known as the crusty but benign chief on TV's The Rookies.

Engel (and Orkin's) last feature is Weddings and Babies, the most elaborate of the three, with a bonafide star in the lead -- the luminous Swedish actress Viveca Lindfors. Playing the male lead is again an unlikely choice: John Myhers, who you've seen on dozens of movies and TV shows usually as an administrative figure, most notably in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. His performance, though not quite as adroit as Lindfors', is touching and restrained. The story takes place in Little Italy during the festival and sizzles with authenticity.

In a modern movie marketplace blaring with special effects extravaganzas, what a refreshing change to cool down with three unpretentious gems. Sometimes a lack of budget results in special degree of creativity and ingenuity.",1312070400,,2460,4.9014423076923075

Coney Island has had many incarnations, always as an amusement area. And Coney Island in the summer of 1952 is the background to this charming film. In Little Fugitive the Wonder Wheel, Parachute Jump and the Horse Race and more are in their prime. Only the Wonder Wheel is still running today. The Horse Race burned down and the parachute jump tower is a derelict.

And, since the background action is not staged, the people in this film are real. When those folks--teenagers in 1952 and senior citizens today--thought about the next generation, our world is the future they contemplated.

The commentary by director Morris Engel is a primer on how to make a serious low budget feature, interesting to any film student but also to any film fan.

Engel was also the cameraman. He shot the entire thing on black and white 35mm film using a hand held camera. All of the shooting was silent with the dialog, music and effects added in a studio later.

While writing this I looked on the web to see what happened to Richie Andrusco. I found this instead: when Morris Engel died in 2005 at the age of 86, the New York Times wrote of him as ""the New York photographer and filmmaker whose 1953 film, 'The Little Fugitive,' established a model for independent moviemaking that influenced directors like John Cassavetes and Franois Truffaut...""

And what little bit of talking he does do in the movie you can hear his New Yawk accent. Like when he's trying to knock down the milk bottles with the baseball at the arcade in Coney Island, and he tells the man standing next to him, hey mista, can ya move ova so I can take my shot. I'm really glad I found this DVD, now I can watch it whenever I'm in the mood. The days portrayed in this DVD are sadly long gone.

3364163,4,B0014D5QRE,"I love the documentaries that come with the Criterion boxed set and I especially admire Morris Engel for his courage in standing up to the big studios.  That said, Lovers and Lollipops isn't a great movie.  Though it may be a great work of art.  Oh what a paradox.

It is really the story of Hamlet if Hamlet was not the prince of Denmark but instead a small girl living with her mom in a charming mid-1950s Manhattan apartment.

And it is oddly similar to Francoise Sagan's Bonjour Tristesse, in which the heroine will do anything, and I mean anything, to make sure her father doesn't re-marry, and the tension is between her hatred of Deborah Kerr and her growing admiration for her, even though she has vowed to destroy her.  Her the little girl is determined to get Larry out of her life even if it means destroying her mother's main chance for a happy new life.  And yet she likes Larry and has many good times with him.  He buys her a miniature sailboat, and a dancing bear doll that claps cymbals together--from the old Macy's toy department--clever product placement of the Macy's bag.  He reads to her, jokes with her, but maybe Peggy knows that deep down he doesn't really like her and his affectionate-seeming banter is only part of his ploy to win her mother's heart.  Ann (the mother, played by Lori March) is bright enough, but in some ways she's dumb as a post.

Oh, those lollipops!  Stanley Kubrick had Lolita licking a lollipop, but little Peggy plants hers, stick down, in the sand at Jones Beach, and then washes off the sand by sticking them under the incoming waves.  No wonder Ann gets so upset with Larry!  I didn't understand exactly what it was about Larry's father.  Larry wanted Ann to meet his father but to make no mention of Peggy?  So whatever happened to that plot, it just went the way of the lollipops I guess.  The film itself remains as a great open window into a long-ago bourgeois dream of Manhattan without crime, without dirt, without race, a Jamesian New York modeled on the London of What Maisie Knew.

Weddings and Babies attempts to widen the racial paradigms of L&L by introducing the character of Bea, a nomadic lonely soul who hails from--what, Sweden I guess.  She is played by Viveka Lindfors who seems to be channeling the spirit of Anna Magnani, who was very much alive at the time and who is responsible, by her carbon copy here--well, make that a very faint 4th generation Xerox--for the link between the Engel-Orkin films and the original neo-realismo of De Sica and Rossellini.",1241481600,,2533,4.588888888888889
3364164,4,B0014D5QRE,"Little Fugitive is an independent movie that has a creative storyline and the acting, all done by people new to movie making, is excellent. The plot moves along well at the beginning but it does slow down a bit too much for the main portion of the film. However, the cinematography is great, Morris Engel's camera technique works wonders for this film--he had a 35mm camera strapped to his chest to film most of this picture! In addition, the choreography works well in the scuffle scene between two of the older boys as well as the scenes inside the apartment where the Nortons live.

When the action starts, we meet some young boys who want to play even though they're a bit cranky and tired of playing the same old games day in and day out in their Brooklyn, New York City neighborhood. Lennie Norton (Richard Brewster) likes to tease his younger brother Joey (Richie Andrusco); and Lennie's friends Harry (Charlie Moss) and Charley (Tommy DeCanio) don't like Joey too much, either.

One day, Lennie and Joey discover that their mother (Winifred Cushing) has to spend the weekend away visiting their sick grandmother. Their mother tells Lennie to take care of Joey; when Lennie protests that he wants to go to Coney Island for his birthday their mother says he's have to go another time. This really gets the tension up between Joey and Lennie.

However, Lennie has a plan--with the help of his friends Harry and Charley. They trick Joey into thinking that he accidentally killed Lennie with a ""real"" bullet in a ""real"" gun; and Harry tells Joey to ""beat it"" before the cops come for him! Joey falls for this because he is a rather young and impressionable child; and he flees with a few things of his and goes for a subway ride. Where does Joey end up? Coney Island!

The scenes filmed at Coney Island are very well done and it does indeed give this film a documentary flavor. I do wish, however, that the plot moved a bit quicker at this point; and the plot could have been improved even more by the introduction of another young child. Yes, Joey meets another kid who teaches him how to collect bottles to get the nickel deposits back; but it still doesn't give me enough material to truly satisfy me.

And of course, the plot could go anywhere from here. Does Lennie ever find out where his brother his? How will the pony-ride man Jay (Jay Williams) figure into all this? Will Lennie go to a cop to help him find Joey? How will Joey manage on his own at Coney Island? Watch and find out!

The DVD comes with two documentary short features; and I really liked the footage in this film of Coney Island and Brooklyn from back in the day. As a native New Yorker, that was great to watch.

Overall, Little Fugitive is a good motion picture despite the fact that it suffers a bit from a plot that moves too slowly for the main portion of the picture. Nevertheless, I recommend this film for people who like independent film; and people who enjoy footage of what New York's Brooklyn and Coney Island looked like way back when will also enjoy this film.",1240617600,,3052,4.528130671506352
3364165,4,B0014D5QRE,"Talk about a movie with a different feel to it!

It looks like a home movie with real people, not actors. Actually, it almost is that, as these were new actors filmed by new filmmaker managing on a threadbare budget.

The little boy in the film, Richie Andrusco, was the central character and he had never acted before and has never acted after this film! No wonder he looked so ""real."" Most of the people in the film - at least in the background - were real people, not actors, so you really get a feel of being in New York City and Coney Island in particular in the mid 1950s.

The story is a simple one, about a kid who thought he killed his brother and runs away, spending a night and two days at Coney Island. It shows how a kid that age probably would spend his time at this place. You almost have to fast-forward through a couple of scenes as they go on too long, such as the boy picking up bottles to return for cash.

Also, it's very interesting that a hand held camera was used especially back in those days.  Coney Island buffs will enjoy seeing the park when it really was an amusement park.

I recomend this film to anyone with young children, as it's an excellent study of boys & how they relate to each other & the pranks that can get them into trouble.

3364177,5,B0014D5QRE,"Though this film is certainly not for all tastes, I have to say that it's definitely one of my all time favorites.  I strongly recall watching it on PBS late at night as a child, and was overjoyed to rediscover it as an adult.  It doesn't hurt at all, either, that I'm a HUGE fan of Coney Island history, and that this film is chock-full of 1953 footage of the park, back in the good ol' days.

The plot is incredibly simple - a young boy is tricked by his older brother and latter's unkind friends, into believing that he's committed murder.  The boy runs off to Coney Island to take it on the lam, and, while there, learns a whole lot about the world.  From finding out about the glory of 5-cent deposits, to (finally) riding a real pony, we see what's important in his little life, and see how he ekes out a survival for himself during his day and night away from home.

There is hardly any dialogue once he's in the park, and it's refreshing, really - almost a sensory experience through the eyes of a little boy.  We are treated to a more innocent time - with very little effort, one can smell the odors of the boardwalk, taste the sweetness of a watermelon slice, and feel the sand beneath the feet.  I haven't seen another film quite like this - it's truly magical.

For the Coney Island enthusiasts out there, the footage from the park is fantastic.  It stands as a wonderful record of the past - the parachute jump, batting cages, food stands, a marvelous carousel, souvenir booths...it's all here, and it's incredible.  If you haven't seen this film, you're missing out, and then some.

Overall, I can admit that this film isn't for all folks - it's slow-moving, quiet, and can drag along a bit - if you don't surrender to it, and take it at it's own pace.  Once you've done so, however, you'll see how great a film it really is.",1082678400,,1839,4.357771260997067

Coney Island in the '50s was a faded resort. Its streets and back alleys contained the ghosts and survivals of a more vibrant era. What makes this movie remarkable is the extent to which it captures not only the appearance of the area but the way it FELT for a young kid encountering its sights and people. I cannot find a single wrong note or unfamiliar or contrieved situation, at least so far as Coney itself is concerned.
Unfortunately, the plot is so thin that it might have been better to dispense with it altogether, though I suppose it was necessary, especially in the '50s, to explain why an eight-year-old was wandering unescorted through a sometimes dangerous area.
I won't quibble about the plot too much. I am grateful that, just like some of the silly old silent comedies that gave us glimpses of Luna Park and other disappeared pieces of history, future generations get a chance to ""walk"" through another era with a minimum of affectation or interpretation.
I was moved not to give five stars as I believe the extra star would only have been expressing my nostalgia. For the film alone I might have been inclined to give it three, but more knowledgeable people than I attest that this was a groundbreaking film, so ""four"" seems just about right.",1037145600,,1406,4.583333333333333
3364180,5,B0014D5QRE,"I liked this movie.  It isn't a movie to watch with a bunch of people or when you are tired.  This movie is slow moving --BUT...very relaxing.  You follow this boy around NYC and Coney Island and you realize how nice just the simple things are in life.  I also imagined my Dad watching this movie and saying things like, ""I remember that type of..."" .  So, if you were a kid during this generation you probably would be very nostalgic.  I learned a lot about how life would be as a boy during the 50's--the director didn't hype it up with a lot of drama--just a nice capture of certain moments. The director probably didn't know it back then, but he captured a good piece of real life history. Watch it mid morning and you'll have a great day.",1027641600,,743,4.271428571428571
3364181,5,B0014D5QRE,"When you first start watching this movie, you think the director has a budget of $10. But what you discover is a pioneer of the indendent film. This little gem is a whisical tale of 7 year old Joey Norton, who's dooped by friends into thinking he's shot and killed his older brother, Richie. Upon believing this, Joey exiles himself to Coney Island, with Richie in hot pursuit. The film does a wonderful job of catching the innocence of the 50's. If you can get them away from the computer, video games and Sponge Bob, I truly believe that even kids today would enjoy this little piece of ""Americana""",1013126400,,600,4.513761467889908

Whether you are from Iowa or Brooklyn, NY, you will be taken back to the time of your innocence, when the world was good and life was sweet. Powerful and so  well done, this film looks as if it were a documentary following a child  into another world. You feel it in your gut. It's also a lot of fun as  well. As a personal manager repping children, exclusively I can honestly  say that this film and these actors are the reason that keep me hopeful.  They just don't make 'em like that anymore.",949104000,,559,4.186915887850467

I finally got a DVD that worked and I liked the movie so I am re-rating this movie with the 5 stars it deserves.,1524614400,,368,4.183098591549296

8255257,5,B0014D5QRE,"I had never seen Little Fugitive until recently, though it's apparently quite famous and influential among certain film historians and movie people. Other reviews point out that it's especially worthwhile if you were around in 1953 or grew up in New York. Neither of those apply to me and I still purchased the DVD after seeing the movie on TCM. The DVD has some nice extras, including a voice-over commentary by Morris Engel that tells you all you need to know about this little movie's production. Using non-actors and shot guerilla style (almost like a well-conceived home movie, obviously shot by a professional photographer), the Little Fugitive is an entertaining look at what it's like to be a little boy on the run in a big world. You wouldn't think watching a seven-year-old boy eating hotdogs and going on pony rides at Coney Island would be so captivating. Obviously this film's a little dated and non-PC at times, and with inherent technical limitations, but little Joey's adventures will remind you of your own youth (especially if you were a red-blooded boy) like no other movie I can think of. Besides, the kid's cute as heck and fun to watch. Check him out swinging wildly at baseballs in the batting cage. You can't script or choreograph that, just turn on the camera and capture the magic of childhood. One caveat re the DVD, I ordered through Amazon after I discovered that some of the dirt-cheap offerings online were for the Korean or Chinese version with similar cover art and packaging; it'll play OK (or so they say), but apparently has subtitles and other annoying features.",1490486400,,1599,4.839416058394161

8255260,5,B0014D5QRE,"Taken from the styles and sensibilities of the great new realist movement of 1950's cinema, The Little Fugitive is one of the best movies of all time.
If you regard the following (perhaps historical) characteristics and morality of American childhood as wonderful then Little Fugitive is for you;
1) Large amounts of free time spent in discovering the world around you is good
2) Freedom to make decisions for yourself in a safe and more innocent world is good for you
3) The lesson of being accountable to i) family and ii) others is an important one
4) kindness and care directed toward you from adults other than parents is valuable

This movie is a giant in American Film History though its footprint is small and all but forgotten today, its lessons are great barely noticeable as such.
