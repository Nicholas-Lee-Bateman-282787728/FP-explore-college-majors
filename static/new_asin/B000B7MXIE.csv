2404769,4,B000B7MXIE,"This is a 3 disc single sided set with the first 22 episodes at about 48 minutes each.  Disc 1&2 8 episodes each, disc 3 6 episodes.  The picture quality isn't the best, but the set is cheap.  It does not only run 10 hours as the box and description state.",1139184000,8,256,3.980392156862745
2404770,4,B000B7MXIE,"I used to watch this show all the time in the 90's. It just fun and campy, and yet there are many out there that are hunting the internet for copies. Well, finally it is here!

This 3 disc set states its the first season and has 22 episodes, however, the first season was only 9 episodes. What they have done is put all the episodes with the orginal bartender Ian on this DVD set. So that means you get 13 episodes of season 2 as well as the 9 of season 1. Half way through season 2, Ian leaves and the new character Spider is introduced. I am now hoping they release the remainder of season 2 and all of season 3.

There aren't any special features, its a pretty simple set, but for those wanting these episodes, its perfect!",1137369600,18,726,4.141843971631205

8082851,4,B000B7MXIE,"The first season was filmed at our beach house in Bucerias, Mexico with the bar and dive shop built between the house and the ocean in the federal zone without our knowledge.  Ultimately we had to threaten a law suit to have these improvements (?) removed and have the beach and beach house restored to its pre Sweating Bullets state. The series is fun and great to watch as you see an area, Bahia de Banderos inc. Punta de Mita (just North of Puerto Vallarta) which has since been transformed from a sleepy seaside village with a great beach with intense development.",1431993600,,568,4.568627450980392
8082852,3,B000B7MXIE,"I purchased this season because as a teenager I watched this shows. The price for them were reasonable and looking at them brought back some beautiful memories.

After getting this season I opened the box were it came in just to check if it is complete and to make sure that none of them came broke or damaged. Glad to say that they all arrived in prefect condition.
The disks I played appeared to be playing well and hopefully these will be the case for the rest of the disks.

As I watched these old show you can tell they are filmed many years ago, I mean todays show have higher quality and better acting, stories and stunts but I expected that so I wasn't too disappointed. What really ticked me off was the fact the the dvds seemed to have been made in someone's basement and it still smelled like freshly burned homemade DVDs . Because my DVDs  don't look like the posted images of JP Lawrence, so I decided to upload pictures of my own.",1402099200,,944,4.322033898305085

8082856,2,B000B7MXIE,"First off, if you hated season one of ""Tropical Heat"" a/k/a Sweating Bullets"" don't completely write off the show. It was one of those rare times a show actually got better in its second and third seasons. Yet even the lame first season included the catchy reggae theme song ""Anyway the Wind Blows"" and the two stars (Rob Stewart and Carolyn Dunn) playing off each others as only total opposites can. Steward plays maverick ex-DEA agent Nick Slaughter who moves to one of the Florida Keys and starts a detective agency. Dunn plays his buttoned-down travel agent business partner Sylvie Gerard.

It is an uneasy partnership. Swarthy Nick is laid back, likes to party, and is not particularly keen on working. Sylvie is a burn-don't tan redhead, a brittle uptight computer nerd who disapproves of Nick's lifestyle. When Nick is busy chasing anything in skirts,  Sylvie keeps her focus on agency cash flow. Of course Dunn is far hotter than any of the women Nick is constantly dogging so there is an undercurrent of frustrated attraction between the two; hidden beneath their constant put-downs.

The discerning viewer will quickly spot certain production design issues. The series was filmed in Israel, Mexico, and South Africa; not on location in the Florida Keys and they just didn't have enough of a budget to effectively disguise a vaguely foreign feeling. But once you know this it is possible to suspend disbelief and just concentrate on the characters.

Even stranger than the vaguely off-kilter setting are Season One's choice of guest actresses. Both ""Tropical Heat"" and its counterpart ""Silk Stalkings"" targeted the male demographic. ""Silk Stalkings"" was perceptive enough to cast really hot young actresses for each episode, with more concern about their exploitation potential than their acting ability. But for some strange reason ""Tropical Heat"" filled these roles with the most average looking collection of women you are likely to find this side of your local DVM line.

Your basic acting-for-the-camera class has three tiers of would-be actress. The hot first tier: actresses who look good enough that their acting skills are a bonus, not a necessity. The bottom tier: dogs, pigs, and elephants who can find work in character roles if they look strange enough. The middle tier: girls who need extraordinary acting skills because they look so ordinary, and even those should give serious thought to cooking school. For its first season ""Tropical Heat's"" hired exclusively from the middle tier (plus a few of their mothers); and disqualified those who received ""C"" or better grades. And they wonder why these things are not more popular.

Season one writing is also pretty weak although the Nick-Sylvie exchanges are usually entertaining and appear to have been written by someone who knew what they were doing; apparently the rest of the script writing fell to the second team.

The Season One DVD (which contains most of the Season Two episodes as well) is cheap in both cost and quality. It is viewable but there is no supplemental material and navigation is extremely basic.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1197936000,2,3138,5.032755298651252
8082857,5,B000B7MXIE,"This was one of the best series that pass in the Portuguese TV. I buy this set of 22 episodes yesterday and I want to receive them soon.

I was searching it about 5 years and now I find it. I hope the rest of the other season episodes will also be released, because I want all of them.

This Serie also makes me in love by the Carribean Islands and the Keys.

If someone have the other episodes please contact me.",1162512000,2,413,4.012195121951219
8082858,5,B000B7MXIE,"I just loved this TV show when it came out. Sure the plot was always cheesy, and it was painfully obvious that it was all being filmed in Israel rater than the Florida Keys(at least I seem to recall seeing endless aeroplanes with  the El-Al sign on them etc.)

The 5 stars is because I thought Carolyn Dunn was one of the prettiest actresses on TV at the time, and because the show made me laugh due to its absurd camp humour.",1140825600,8,426,4.182926829268292
