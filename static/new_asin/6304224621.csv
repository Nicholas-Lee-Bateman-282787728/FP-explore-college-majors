813078,4,6304224621,Anyone who is a fan of THE PHANTOM comic strip will enjoy this film adaptation staring Billy Zane of Titanic fame in the lead role of the Phantom. The Phantom is actually the descendant of an entire line of  ancestors who have protected the jungle from old time pirates to their  modern day counterparts. All the interesting bits and pieces from the  popular comic strip are here. Lots of action adventure typical of the  Indiana Jones films abound and the jungle scenery is breathtaking.  Enjoyable fare for the entire family.,923961600,,527,4.811111111111111
813079,4,6304224621,"This picture was ignored by most critics and few people saw it on the theaters here in Brazil. But it is a very good action movie. It has the spirit of Indiana Jones films, as it takes places in distant places, in a  deep forest, it has a lot of mystic in the air and it happens during the II  WW. The scenes of fight and action are very exciting and the famous  super-hero seems to move very fast. Billy Zane is perfectly cast in the  title role. Kristy Swanson was very beautiful and charming in her first  movies, but seems to be loosing her attraction. The role of Diana here  should have been played by gorgeous and athletic villain Catherine Zeta  Jones, whose hair is even similar to the comics character (later she would  appear in another comics character, ""Zorro""). One of the reasons  for the good production is the presence of Joe Dante as Executive Producer.  He now could film the story of the honeymoon of the Phantom, which would be  a great hit.",917481600,5,962,4.409090909090909

813377,3,6304224621,"While well-intentioned and fun, this movie is very much a bagful of contradictions. The script seesaws uneasily between adventure and campiness, starting out fairly strong but veering wildly in the second half. Billy Zane makes a likeable Ghost Who Walks (though he's caught flat-footed by the badguys a bit too often), and Kristy Swanson does the best she can with a standard-issue plucky heroine role. Treat Williams, however, goes over the top at every opportunity, sadistically ruthless one minute and just plain goofy the next, reflecting the whole movie's confusion about the tone it's trying to take.

Still, an obvious affection for the Phantom's mythology shines through, and it's an enjoyable enough romp--- though you'll probably find yourself puzzling over its missteps and illogical moments as soon as the end credits start rolling.",1522800000,,845,5.353383458646617

813641,5,6304224621,"I've thought The Phantom was one cool comic strip hero since I was a kid. I never felt like I really got enough of the character, and I was delighted when a feature film was made. I wasn't disappointed.

The story is exciting, and acting performances are rich. Treat Williams drips charisma and evil. An early look at Catherine Zeta Jones is eye catching, and she gives a solid performance as the leader of an all woman mercenary team.

Billy Zane hits a home run as the Phantom. First, he looks good in the suit. That's always a must for a costumed hero film. Second, he gives a confident performance of a heroic character, and delivers his clever ""humor"" lines with just the right amount of wry charm. Zane (and/or stunt men) give the character a sense of strength and grace that are demanded to make the Phantom work on screen.

The cinematography is beautiful to behold, especially jungle and water scenes. They draw you right into the screen. As a cap off, I also enjoyed the score, and the main theme is catchy, which I also like to have in a comic hero movie. The movie is a feast for the senses, and for fans of the Comic strip. My only regret was that it did not do well enough at the box office to spawn a string of sequels.",1503273600,6,1234,4.333333333333333

If not, I really doubt you'll enjoy it.

My family and I have seen many movies based on older comic strips, such as the many films based on Marvel Comics (this one is not Marvel-based).  Awkward and unrealistic conversations among 1-dimensional characters.  I'm all for Willing Suspension of Disbelief as appropriate, but that doesn't allow for a story line that doesn't make sense by the most generous standards.

814434,5,6304224621,"Return now to ancient days of yore, back to the rimy age of, uh, 1996. It's when THE PHANTOM - the live action motion picture - was released to dismal fanfare. It's agreed that Billy Zane is a classically handsome man. But because he could sneer like no one's business, he lands these shady roles. Not so with this movie. Billy Zane is, by gum, the hero. He's Kit Walker, civilian guise of the immortal Phantom. Except the Phantom's not immortal. It's a rumor he likes to perpetuate. This Kit is the 21st incarnation of The Ghost Who Walks. He's the end product of four centuries of the Walker men combatting injustice in lurid purple skivvies. If you, dear viewer, are starved for pulp adventure, come get some. Somewhere in newspaper strip heaven, Lee Falk is smiling down.

The filmmakers got it right. Billy Zane got it right. Zane's take on the Phantom leans towards heroic bombast mixed with a generous spoonful of irreverence. The tone of the movie is equal parts tongue-in-cheek and glorious Saturday matinee. In all of his screen incarnations - the 1943 serial, the DEFENDERS OF THE EARTH cartoon, PHANTOM 2040 - this is the most fun that the Phantom has ever been. It retains the spirit of the source material. The story sets itself in 1938 and shifts from the lush Bengalla jungles to the concrete canyons of New York. It concerns the Phantom's attempts to prevent the three fabled Skulls of Touganda - respectively sculpted out of silver, gold, and jade - from falling into the hands of demented New York industrialist Xander Drax (Treat Williams). Ages-old rumor has it that whosoever reunites these three scattered artifacts will harness unfathomable energy one thousand times greater than any force or high explosive known to man. So, yeah, you don't want that to end up with a nutter.

On film Billy Zane can forever play the sleazy nogoodnik but I'll always think of him thru the prism of this movie. But he's not the only one to shine it up here. Treat Williams has a wicked good time hamming it up as the big bad. There's something very neat about a villain who gets so giddy about his diabolical master plan. A henchman remarks: ""He's on a quest for a supernatural power."" Kristy Swanson is a feisty presence and very lovely as the adventurous, two-fisted society girl from Long Island, Diana Palmer. When we first see her, she's fresh off her exploring the frozen north in the Yukon. No wonder Kit Walker's eyes light up when he glimpses his childhood friend for the first time in many years, and check out his sustained bemusement when she then goes adventuring with him in his duties as the Ghost Who Walks. And then there's Catherine Zeta-Jones sashaying her way in as a femme fatale type. Zeta-Jones' performance - much like Williams' - has an element of self-aware campiness, and it's a lot of fun. I will say that her character arc comes off unconvincing. There's this abrupt swerve.

A nag: The Phantom's mighty steed falls just short of being as ridiculous as Silver in THE LONE RANGER (the one with Depp). Its antics are hard to buy because a horse can't be that clever, can it? The wolf actually comes off more believable. But, again, this is all done in fun and, so, quite easy for me to overlook.

The movie would be remissed were it to omit that ancient order of evil, the Tsing Brotherhood, and their dreaded spider web tattoo. Their inclusion only fortifies that pulp adventure vibe. Yo, if I haven't convinced you yet, I'm not sure what else to say. Listen, THE PHANTOM (1996), THE SHADOW (1994), and THE ROCKETEER (1991) all came out in roughly the same period, and so these three pulp icons are forever linked in my mind. I highly recommend all three. But, of the three, I say THE PHANTOM is the most cheeky and delivers the richest back story. There's nothing like a legacy hero. Zane takes to his role with supreme gusto and commitment. The sets are panoramic and spectacular, particularly the jungles of Bengalla, my new vacation destination if only the guy in purple would ease off on interlopers. Practical effects inform the stunts, and so what we get are action beats that hold up tremendously even today. I love how unpretentious the movie is, how bright and colorful and cheerfully goofy it is. And yet there's enough of what's earnest in Zane's performance that you do get invested in his end game and his understated romance with Diana. And my favorite line comes courtesy of the Phantom's Hindi butler who doesn't hesitate to scold his boss's guest: No smoking in the Skull Cave.",1446854400,14,4530,4.6800501882057715

Kristy Swanson's Diana was spot on, though I felt Catherine Zeta-Jones was just a wee bit over the top, but still did a fine job.  Treat Williams s Xander Dax was a totally perfect evil villain and his henchmen were also well done.  They certainly came across as a group of ""Igors"" whose shoe size was higher than their IQ's.

815007,4,6304224621,"When this film was originally released in 1996, I wasn't that impressed. First off, having Kit Walker's father, Phantom #20 (Patrick McGoohan), materialize in ghostly form to give advice to his descendant was too much of a departure from creator Lee Falk's stories. Plus, Guran, chief of the pigmy Bandar tribe, was inexplicably changed (but, to be fair, what works on the comic strip page could have proven laughable -- or worse -- on screen). A recent re-viewing of the film helped me overcome these negative first impressions and enjoy Billy Zane's excellent performance in the title role and Catherine Zeta-Jones' spot-on turn as Sala of the Sky Band. Treat Williams is a bit over the top as the villain of the piece, yet Australian director Simon Wincer (""Lonesome Dove"") knows his subject well. The Phantom is practically the national hero in his native Australia (having appeared in comic books there since 1948) and this film gets better with every viewing.",1417305600,3,965,5.0

815010,5,6304224621,"For those who don't know, The Phantom began as a comic strip in the golden age of comics - the 1930's. The Phantom is the ""ghost who walks"" and is the defender of the downtrodden, mortal enemy of pirates everywhere. How can you beat a guy who carries two Colt .45 autos?

The film has all the charm of those old 1930's adventure films. Kit Walker, alter ego of the Phantom, is played by Billy Zane who pulls off the role with ease. The Ghost Who Walks is equally at home in the jungle or the concrete jungle of New York City. The ""damsel in distress"", Diane Palmer, is played by Kristy Swanson and is an eminently capable person in the same mold as Amelia Earhart and is one tough cookie! Catherine Zeta Jones plays the evil aviatrix in league with Xander Drax, the modern criminal mastermind.

Whether it's flying a biplane that just ran out of fuel, riding a horse through the jungle with the bad guys right behind him or shooting it out with pirates, the Phantom never fails to right wrongs, defeat evil and uphold the right! This is good, fun adventure that can be enjoyed by the whole family. Is there a certain amount of belief that must be suspended? Yep...and that's okay occasionally.

I think this is a good, fun adventure film which all ages can enjoy and is faithful to the tone of the original comics. I recommend this with five stars.",1416182400,2,1348,4.42741935483871

You cannot dislike an adventure film like this one.  Be on the lookout for a young Catherine Zeta-Jones, Kristy Swanson and the actor who played Shang Tsung in ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995) a year later.

The kid from ""Back to the Future"" (1985) and ""Back to the Future Part 2"" (1989) wears the blue tights atop a horse.  This one came out the very same year of ""Titanic"" (1996), where Billy Zane became the boyfriend we loved to hate.  Most notable is the role of Xander Drax played by  Treat Williams.  I would like to see more of Kit Walker in New York City but no film is perfect.

""The Phantom"" (1996) is not likely to be released on Blu-Ray again.  Retail price for this movie will present itself when a new format is created to replace Blu-Ray nowhere in the near future.

Best of all are the special effects. Until now no other version of the Phantom had been adapted to the screen since 1943. The Phantom serial starring Tom Tyler doesn't begin to measure up! This serial had a good storyline/plot and a fine cast of actors. But the serial nearly defeats itself due to very cheaply done special effects. I'm so glad we have this version out today!

815401,4,6304224621,"I like this movie, yes, really. Yup, it's awfully hokey and the plotting is *awful* at times but, geez, it's entertaining IF you enjoyed 1930's style serials with rambling weird plots and peculiar characters, bad acting, and ""thrilling!!"" experiences/escapes. but this has a much better budget and attitude. Similar in spots to both the 1966 Batman TV show and the movie (1992?) THE SHADOW, this is almost as good as SHADOW was (same actor as villianish type too (Takagawa) but his role in SHADOW far better imo.

Anyway, the settings are gorgeous, the plot moves fast, and ALL the expected Phantom info business is here, all played quite straight. Well, nearly... Billy Zane is perfect as Phantom/Kit and so is Kristy Swanson as Diana Palmer - and *most* of the actors are good too (Zeta Jones, wow! her role not well-written but boy is she gorgeous!!). One large caveat/warning though - Treat Williams' villian - yikes! *Where* to begin! So enormously over-the-top as to cause sugar shock, with bad acting that would have embarrassed Ming The Merciless...! His performance is terribly out-of-sync with the rest of the cast and his scenes overwhelm their work, nearly destroying the ""Phantom world"" ambience, alas. The settings and characters except for Williams are all ""of a piece"" and pull you into a very enjoyable adventure, until he comes on-screen. Annoying, but ymmv.

Williams' villian got in the way of my enjoyment (it would have rated 5-stars for me except for him), but if you're either quite stoned (and, thus, everything will just seem hillarious...) or able to ignore his part and go along with the rest of the plot and enjoy the characters, this is a lot of fun. And much, much better than the ~2009 Tv show supposedly based on the Phantom character. That was far too generic a treatment of Hero Saves the Universe!! kind of thing and except for the names of characters wasn't anything like the comics character at all. This movie is entirely built around the original character and premise.

This movie is a quite specific adventure tale set in a very particular old-fashioned world that looks awfully pretty, filled with people you either adore or hate, with a happy ending and a very good time had by pretty much all, along the way. The director obviously enjoys adventure tales, learned from Indiana Jones and Shadow movies, and has a good - if often juvenile - sense of humor.

Highly recommended for those of us who love beautiful scenery, good-looking people mostly acting pretty well, beautiful sets and costumes, a fast moving (but totally unbelievable) plot, a hero to admire and a heroine ditto, and several supporting characters that you can enjoy. Predictable, enjoyable, entertaining. The ending seemed to point to a second movie that, alas, never got made. Too bad, IMO. And Zane is now too old for the part, a shame. He was awfully cute in those purple tights... (grin)",1401408000,,2903,4.882352941176471

815588,4,6304224621,"The Bangalla Jungla. 1938. A group of men, led by the surly and short-tempered Quill, forces a young native boy to guide them to a cave deep in the jungle, despite the boy's protests that the area is forbidden, protected by a being known as ""the ghost who walks."" Quill's three men Styles, Breen and Morgan are skeptical... but Quill knowingly rubs a scar on his cheek in the shape of a tiny skull and tells them not to worry about this ""ghost.""

Leaving the kid tied up in their truck, Quill and his men, Styles, Morgan and Breen, enter the cave, where they find a variety of treasure. But none of the gold and jewelry is as precious as what Styles finds - a silver skull with green jewels for eyes. It quickly becomes apparent that this is what the men have come for. Despite a small setback (if you can call Styles being killed by a skeleton that inexplicably comes to life and strangles him a ""small setback""), the crooks successfully exit with the skull and their other ill-gotten loot, only to come face to face with the jungle's protector, a masked man in a purple body stocking astride a white stallion, accompanied by a ferocious wolf. No one is more terrified than Quill, who orders Breen to shoot the man. To their surprise and horror, the man, the ""ghost who walks,"" shoots Breen's gun right out of his hand with a firearm of his own!

He is the Phantom. His horse: Hero. His wolf: Devil. He is the ghost who walks. And he protects the jungle.

The Phantom (really American Kit Walker) easily defeats and captures Breen and Morgan, and rescues the native boy, but Quill escapes with the silver skull. Turning the criminals over to the Jungle Patrol led by Captain Philip Horton, the Phantom returns to his cavern lair and seeks the guidance of his father's spirit. Through him, he learns that the silver skull the looters came for is one of the mystical Skulls of Touganda. There are three - one made of silver, one made of gold, and one made of jade. If all three are brought together they'll produce a powerful supernatural force deadlier than any weapon known to mankind. And Quill still has it!

In New York, Kit's old college friend Diana Palmer returns from a sojourn to the Yukon to visit her uncle, Dave Palmer, who owns the Tribune newspaper. She finds him butting heads with noted businessman Xander Drax at a posh mixer, after which Drax is compelled to leave following insinuations he has ties to the notorious Zephro crime family. In private, Dave reveals that he's learned through a highly placed source at the library that Drax has been researching the Skulls of Touganda. He comes to the same conclusions the Phantom did, and wants to go to the Bangalla Jungle to talk to Captain Horton of the matter, however, due to his age, Diana decides to go in his stead. She boards a plane for the Orient the next day, unaware that crime boss Ray Zephro and his brother Charlie are watching her, and inform Drax of her departure.

After disposing of the librarian who spoke to Dave Palmer (by tricking him into looking through a microscope that has knives come out of the eyepieces - yuck!), Drax sends his all-female pilot corps, the Sky Bandits, to intercept Diana's plane. They force it down over the sea. Diana surrenders to the pilots' leader, Sala, to spare the lives of the other passengers, and is taken captive aboard Quill's ship. The Phantom learns of her abduction from Horton, and manages to rescue her (and, of course, she never realizes his identity). He still fails to recover the silver skull, though. After seeing her safely back to New York, the Phantom, realizing it is Drax who is the one who is behind everything, also heads to the Big Apple in an effort to prevent the ruthless businessman from obtaining any more of the magical skulls. He arrives under his real name, and after he and Diana catch up, he decides to try and obtain the second skull before Drax does.

But he may already be too late. Quill and Sala have delivered the silver skull to Drax. Quill tells his boss about the Phantom, claiming to have encountered and killed him before, insisting the ""ghost who walks"" can't die. Drax is unconcerned because he knows the location of the jade one. Worse, when the first two are brought together they'll reveal the location of the third. And with the Zephro family and the corrupt Commissioner Farley at Drax's beck and call, the Phantom is going to have his hands full fighting evil in the big city...

Generally considered a flop, this is actually a darn fine movie in my opinion. Billy Zane as the Phantom makes a wonderfully charismatic and jolly hero, very much in the swashbuckling, old movie serial vein, whilst Treat Williams chews the scenery and spits it out as the villainous Drax, who simply loves being sadist and evil more than any villain I've ever seen. Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy!) is decent as Diana, while I find Catherine Zeta-Jones as Sala just plain annoying. The supporting cast is pretty good, particularly Patrick McGoohan as the Phantom's father, James Remar as Quill, and Shang Tsung himself, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, as the pirate lord Kabai Sengh, a prominent villain who doesn't show up until near the end.

The shooting locations and action sequences are good, and the sets are mostly decent except for the pirate lair at the end, which looks pretty fake. The action scenes are good. The Phantom's rescue of the native boy from the truck hanging off the collapsing bridge, the escape from Quill's ship in a biplane, the chase on horseback through New York, and the climactic swordfight with the pirates all excite and delight. Only the finale is a letdown, with the magical skulls' destructive power being pretty underwhelming, performance-wise.

Blood and gore is minimal. It has a few scary bits, such as the skeleton coming to life and killing Styles, but this is nothing that I haven't already seen in a Mummy movie. Drax's death is all special effects-y and more cartoonish than violent, and even the blinding of the librarian by the infamous killer microscope occurs entirely offscreen. Really, the most violent deaths are when we see a pretty brutal direct hit from a cannonball, and when someone gets eaten by sharks. Lots of blood there. But by and large it's all fairly tame.

Bottom line, The Phantom is fun. The type of superhero movie they don't make anymore.",1391472000,,6357,4.677996422182469

A ship taken over by pirates. The death of a father. A young boy thrown overboard. Washing up on the shore of the Island of Bengalla. A strange ritual and a vow. When that boy grew up and became a man, he became the Phantom.

Centuries later, this boy's descendant--the 21st Phantom (Billy Zane)--is protecting his beloved jungle when thieves steal a sacred skull from a lost treasure trove. The Phantom learns the significance of the skull and discovers it is one of three and should someone ever possess all three, they would have ultimate power. Trailing the stolen skull to New York, the Phantom, now under his civilian guise of Kit Walker, seeks to track down the remaining skulls. While there, he reconnects with his old flame, Diana Palmer (Kirsty Swanson), and the two need to reconcile past differences as Kit learns the location of the second skull. Meanwhile, evil businessman Xander Drax (Treat Williams), in cahoots with the Sengh Brotherhood, a band of pirates--the descendants of the same pirates that were responsible for sinking the ship of the father of the first Phantom--and Drax wants the skulls for themselves. Drax, too, discovers the location of the second skull at the same time Kit and Diana do and after a failed attempt at disposing of Kit, kidnaps Diana and takes her to the location of the third: an uncharted island.

Good confronts evil when the Phantom seeks to rescue Diana while also stopping Drax and the Sengh Brotherhood from uniting the three skulls and becoming a powerful force in the world.

Phantom lore is fascinating, especially the idea that he never dies, or, at least, that's what criminals and evildoers everywhere think. ""The Ghost Who Walks"" has been around since 1936, which predates Superman, making the Phantom one of the earliest superheroes. I remember seeing trailers for this flick back when it first came out and getting all excited. It was superhero, swashbuckling adventure. Even saw it in the theatre. On that day I was running a bit behind. If I remember right, I missed the previews and came in right when the movie was starting. The first words I saw where the words that kicked off the film, ""For those who came in late."" I really thought the movie somehow knew I was late--or people like me--because then it went into a recap of the Phantom's origin before launching into the main story. Ahh, to be a young, gullible fanboy again.

This movie was clean, wholesome superhero fun. There was a decent story, superhero action, humor and adventure, with a little romance thrown in. It didn't take itself seriously, but wasn't a giant camp fest either. I still pop in the DVD now and then and enjoy The Phantom as a nice break from the oh-so-heavy-drama-laden superhero movies of today. Sometimes you just want to see a good guy busting bad guys and that's it.

Nowadays, this movie falls short in a few places--the ""wow factor,"" the costume, the life-or-death-save-the-world-or-die storylines--but I was happy with Billy Zane's portrayal of the Phantom and with the movie as a whole. I've never read any of the comics so my view is completely on the flick and it being a simple superhero story. I will say that this movie has stirred in me an interest in the Phantom and am thinking of one day getting into the comics that spawned him.

The movie is definitely kid-friendly and as a parent who doesn't let his kids watch a good chunk of today's superhero flicks due to their mature content, this is one I'd recommend for families or those just looking for a break from the more grown-up, adult-oriented superhero movies of today.",1369008000,2,3605,4.767628205128205

816118,4,6304224621,"It is rare when a movie with such a beloved yet obscure action hero character is made with such great care. Such is the case with The Phantom, a superhero epic directed by Simon Wincer. Like a lot of other 90's adventure comic book films (Dick Tracy, The Rocketeer and The Shadow), The Phantom was riding on the coat tails of the wildly successful Batman movie from 1989. It was a treat to see the source material so respected, however it may have been a better movie if the villain, Xander Drax (played by Treat Williams) had been a more serious threat and actor Billy Zane (who is perfectly cast here) had played The Phantom in a more mysterious tone. But the movie remains well respected as a movie serial homage and deservedly so. It is fun and successfully keeps the viewer entertained. Even Phantom creator Lee Falk was proud of this film. Storylines from the original comic strips, such as The Gun Belt, The Aviatrix and Pirates of Singh are followed closely. The story has it all... chase scenes, explosions, sword fights, and the search for a mysterious supernatural power.

The Phantom should theoretically fall on its face as it is a simple movie with underdeveloped characters, however because it is an attempt to copy the movie serials of the 1930's and 1940's, it works. It's so effective because it brings a modern film-making sensibility to the simplicity of those cliffhanger epics and doesn't compromise any of the gee-whiz factor.

816123,3,6304224621,"... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. After all, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. There's quite a bit of ""Raiders"" in 1996's ""The Phantom""; it's just no where as good. Even the three Indiana Jones sequels are better. But it's not bad either.

Billy Zane shines in the title role -- charming and in absolute perfect shape -- while Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones offer their feminine charms to the mix, not to mention Samantha Eggar. Also on hand are James Remar, Treat Williams and Patrick McGoohan.

""The Phantom"" is just a fun, cartooney adventure that takes place mostly in the jungle, with some parts in the big city. It's great for a night when you're in the mood for some light viewing.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Thailand, Australia and California.

The action scenes are entertaining, very Indiana Jones-like. The acting wasn't amazing, but decent. Others rip this movie because its a guy running around in a purple suit - well thats typical of a comic book character to me. Just go watch this movie and enjoy.",1299542400,,445,4.5625
816344,5,6304224621,"The Phantom is a perfect example of translating the source material literally from comic strip to big screen. I don't think there is a finer example of that application than with this film. That being said, the flip side to this method is the understanding you either ""get it"" or you don't. The Phantom predates heroes like Batman. So concepts, such as the Skull Cave, may appear like a pale imitation to the Bat Cave when, in fact, it was the Phantom's cave which came first and influenced Bob Kane to create this home for his Batman creation. So having a common knowledge of the hero may help avoid simple misunderstandings about ideas which may appear ""stolen"" when in fact they were the Phantom's to start with.

So this begs the question - Was this film made strictly for the fans and no one else? Well the answer is both yes and no. Many people are not familiar with the Phantom. However most of the ideas which go into bringing this character to life are already blended into popular heroes as previously stated. It only made sense to stay true to his roots and hope interest would bloom from there. If you stray too far from the source material, then you lose the essence of the character and you end up having a hero no one recognizes. Something the SyFy Channel recently realized when they tried to conceptualize the Phantom into an unrecognizable shadow of his classic form.

So if your a fan of the comic strip or have ever been curious as to the roots of this hero who has survived the many trends of the last 75 years, I would strongly encourage you pick up this movie. It is beautifully shot and well cast based on the characters of the comic strip. Sit back and enjoy the ride. This may be the only time we get to enjoy the Phantom in his purist of forms. Billy Zane made a Phantom the creator Lee Falk was very proud of. That should tell you everything you need to know right there.",1299542400,,1899,4.407407407407407

816479,4,6304224621,"Well i have always liked comics, been reading them since i was 4, yep i learned reading with them :D, and of the few european comics that i liked The Phantom was the one i liked the most.
It was mysterious
It was funny
It had great action
and the pencils/inks were beautiful.

when i read that they were gonna do a adaptation and saw the production shots i thought they better not screw this.

and finally when i saw it in the theatres i was both swimming with joy and grinding my teeth with rage.

i was very happy with The Phantom, how the suit was handled (ok in some scenes the glue came off and the chin parts of the mask lifted from the face but they were minor glitches), how the Phantom moved and stood his ground. Zane definetely was a good fit for the role. he was athletic and had that sincere clean smile that Phantom gives under his mask to his friends and sharp, cold, frightening gaze to his enemies.

The sidekicks were great :D Devil and Hero :D both very nice examples of their scpecies :D

Zane in costume moved like The Phantom moved in the comics. The way he held his guns, the way he crossed hia arms etc etc
it was very good

those were the parts where i coulndt stop myself smile from joy. But there were a couple scenes points where i was so furious i coulndt help but grind my teeth :(

Of 60+ years of publications whoever saw a Walker's face in the comic. but in the movie we get to see in in 5th min :( why they had to go and show the face..a good actor should be able to do his acting without ever showing his face... Look at V for Vendetta. look at Darth Vader (ok they ruined it in return of the jedi too but nonethe less it is one of the most succesfull villian on screen without a face of the actor... ) shadows they could have used shadows to cover most of his face. and whatever happened the the hat and the sun-glasses..ditched in a sec :(

and what about the Skull-Cave...Hollywood could build entire planets, universes, giant buildings but all they came up with for Skull-Cave is white paint over a cave opening :(
come on guys... in the comics no one would be able to wander in to the cave because they couldn't bring themselves advance to the giant skull shaped rock and that scary opening as the mouth....

those were the weak spots of The Phantom on big screen and overall it was quite an enjoyable watch :D

would suggest every fan of the ghost that walks and fan of light action flicks.

cheers

816480,5,6304224621,"Yes this movie sent me back to those sunday mornings of reading the comics section when I was a boy. And no I'm not talking about the cartoon that came out some years later. The comic section was weekly suspense just like those cliff hangers in the theaters years ago. And this movie pulled it off as a full blown remake of those comics. You see back then this guy was Kool wih a capital K. And I was glad to see that they went into such detail about his ring. Cause back when I grew up havin a skull ring was like a nose ring nowadays. Kids knew you read the phantom. But enough about back then.

This movie rocks. And yes, I'd say that into anyones face cause this guy taught me to stand up to bullys. And to do what was right when I saw something going on that was wrong. Sure it got me punched a few times. But its movies and ideas like this that make a person stronger than he or she thinks they are. And that my children creates CHARACTER. The one thing lacking in most of the kids I see today besides respect.

So call me an old crab apple. Say that I'm over the hill. And yes even laugh at me as I walk past you. But by GOD I'll be right there saving your a.. when need be. So go right ahead and put this movie down as a flop. Go right ahead and listen to that idiot friend of yours that smokes that crap and tries to turn you to his side by putting guys like this down. See how far you get in life listening to him.

Or, rent this, and Clint Eastwoods ""Grand Torino"" and sit down with your kids and teach them a thing or two about how a person should react in the face of danger. How respecting another person can make people proud of them. Because thats what this world needs now is kids we can all be proud of. Enough said.",1265414400,13,1734,3.9770114942528734

816482,4,6304224621,"The Phantom (1996) is a fun, campy, action-adventure, that stays pretty true to its comic book origins.  The character, created by Lee Falk, first appeared in 1936, as a newspaper comic strip.  Billy Zane (Titanic, Dead Calm) stars as Kit Walker, the twenty first man to be known as The Phantom, the ghost who walks.  The very first Phantom became a masked costumed crimefighter, after his father was killed by pirates.  Living in the fictitious African land of Bengalla, the original Phantom was succeeded by his son.  With son succeeding father twenty times over the course of some four hundred years, the legend grew that The Phantom, was the man that could not die.

The movie is set in the 1930's, early in Kit Walker's time as The Phantom.  His father, played by Patrick McGoohan (Secret Agent Man, The Prisoner) had recently been stabbed in the back and killed, causing Kit to return from college in America, to replace him as The Phantom.  Living in a cave deep in the jungle, The Phantom has no super powers, and is aided by his friend Guran (Radmar Agana Jao), wolf Devil, and horse Hero.  His symbol is the skull, and his skull ring, is designed to leave the impression of a skull, when he delivers a punch.  Handsome, and with a fine physique, Zane is great as the Phantom, bringing charm, and a sense of youthful inexperience and humor to the role.

Wealthy New York businessman Xander Drax (Treat Williams), is seeking to collect the three skulls of Tuganda, because when the skulls are put together, they unleash a great power.  Newspaper publisher Dave Palmer (Bill Smitrovich) is suspicious of Drax, and sends his niece Diana (Kristy Swanson) on a mission to Bengalla.  Quill (James Remar), the man who killed Kit's Father, is a raider in the employ of Drax.  He has just recovered one of the skulls in Bengalla, and his next task is to stop Diana.  With the help of Sala (Catherine Zeta Jones), Diana is abducted and held prisoner on a ship, but she is freed by The Phantom, and the pair make a thrilling aerial escape into the jungle, with the help of Devil and Hero.  A stunt involving dropping from a plane to a horse, is quite well done.

After learning from Diana, that Drax has a connection to the Sengh Brotherhood, The Phantom sends her back to New York, and Kit himself returns to New York.  Treat Williams plays Drax to the hilt, going over the top with gusto.  Drax strikes next at the Museum of World History, combining his skull with a second skull on display at the museum.  The power of the skulls is displayed, revealing the location of the third skull in The Devil's Vortex.  Kit and DIana are Drax's prisoners, but Kit escapes and then makes a dramatic appearance in the Big Apple, as The Phantom.  Of course anyone paying attention, should be able to figure out that Kit is The Phantom, but no one does, except perhaps a friendly cab driver.

The Phantom hitches a ride on Drax's plane, piloted by Sala.  Beautiful exotic locations in Thailand are featured during the journey to the pirates' haven.  The Sengh Brotherhood's lair is in a secret cave, where their leader the Great Kabai Sengh (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), the keeper of the third skull, reveals that there is a fourth skull.  No one wants to cooperate, so it's time to slam evil!  The Phantom feeds Kabai to the sharks, takes care of Quill, and then faces Drax who has now combined the three skulls.  The Phantom's skull ring, is the mysterious fourth skull, and using its power, Drax is overcome.  The Phantom leads Diana and Sala to safety, as the pirates liar explodes in flames.  Although the movie ends with Diana returning to New York, in the comic she marries Kit, so things were perfectly setup for a sequel.  Oh what could have been, but unfortunately for whatever reasons, the sequel never happened.

Jeffrey Boam's screenplay is a nice mix of humor, goofy good natured action, and romance.  Boam was very familiar with this genre, as executive producer for The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. and as a veteran screenwriter, whose credits include Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).  Like an Indy adventure, the film directed by Australian Simon Wincer, changes locations several times, and finishes with a flurry, although the ending does feel a bit rushed.  Zane and Swanson, have pretty decent chemistry, in rather limited time together.  Perhaps Drax was exaggerated, to balance Zane's rather subdued characterization of the ghost that walks.  The rest of the cast is very good, including a salty James Remar (Dexter), and Oscar winner Catherine Zeta Jones (Traffic, Chicago), in an underused early film appearance.  David Newman does an excellent job of bringing to The Phantom, something of the same kind of excitement and majesty that John Williams brought to Indiana Jones.  The film's OST is well worth a listen.

While The Phantom is certainly not in the same class as Indiana Jones, it is a solid and fun, action adventure.  Hopefully the upcoming blu-ray release will have more to offer in the way of extras, than just the trailer.  A commentary track by Billy Zane, or perhaps Jeffery Boam would be nice, and perhaps fans can find out why a sequel never happened.",1261872000,,5189,4.739130434782608

Billy Zane of course went on to bigger roles (and better costumes) in Titanic and Cleopatra, but he seems to truly be having fun here. Well worth watching, if you can get past the purple suit.",1257811200,,512,5.035294117647059
816554,4,6304224621,"The Phantom takes some getting used to.  Being familiar with Lee Falk's comic strip of the same name, the Phantom was part Batman, part Tarzan, being in the jungle in a skin tight purple spandex outfit, offending villains with his fashion sense.

Actually the film covered the story fairly accurately:  a boy on a ship whose father was killed by pirates, washes ashore (no worse for wear, oddly) and is adopted by a fierce Caribbean tribe and grows to be The Phantom, aka The Ghost Who Walks.

OK, all caught up?  Good.

Because now the film dives into a similar style story as Indiana Jones.  No surprise there as the scriptwriter and co-producer, Jeffrey Boam, also write the script to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  And with a few changes here and there, I am sure this could have been the real Indy 4, but I digress.

The plot (or what there is of one) is essentially this:

Billy Zane (Titanic) stars as The Phantom who searches for the legendary skulls of Touganda which when placed together with a few other skulls (none of them are Crystal by the way) harness great power.

While the search is on, he meets the girl of his dreams, talks to his dead father (in a very Obi Wan Kenobi like way) contemplates how he will carry on the family name.  Gangster Xander Drax, who has 1930s New York in his pocket, is also after these skulls for the power they contain.

Fighting:  Lots of fighting.  Catherine Zeta Jones is a bad girl who must have kicked the nuts out of at least three men.  Kristy Swanson is the rich publisher's daughter who gets kidnapped but not before delivering a mean right hook.  And Billy Zane rides a horse, hangs off an airplane and skids down an elevator shaft cable, no worse for wear.

There are scenes like a microscope with knives and when someone he thinks lied to him is told to look into the microscope, the knives come out and blind the guy.  Drax laughs at this but in the real world he would have been sued or locked up for maiming someone.

But this is 1930s New York, man.  Kinda like the Dick Tracy, The Shadow and The Rocketeer-type films.  Rockem Sockem, makes little sense and is a heck of a lot of fun to watch.

So if you want to unhook your brain and ingest some mindless entertainment, The Phantom is for you.

Interesting facts:  Roger Ebert loved it for some reason, appreciating the accuracy of the comic book style.  And there are plans (as of December 2008) to make a re-make with the same spandex but in modern times instead of the retro '30s.

816555,4,6304224621,"When I was ""knee high to a grasshopper"" in the early fifties - my favorite comic hero was The Phantom.  Not even Batman or Superman could come close. This is a good movie - that could have been great.

The reason is that - unfortunately for those of us Phantom fans - Jeffrey Boam (Co-Producer) - an immensely talented individual - carried much of his Brisco County, Jr. ""mantra"" of ""Just below over the top"" - into this film.  If he hadn't scripted The Phantom's skull ring a/k/a ""The Orb"" (Brisco County) and ""just under over the top"" humor - we could have had a much more serious - and - enjoyable film - more along the lines of Indiana Jones.

Having said that - the action sequences were second to none - (I'm still wondering how they did the airplane to horse ""transfer"") - and - Billy Zane captured the spirit of the 21st Phantom perfectly.

The plot was stronger in the first half of the film - than the second.  However - all was in great fun and enjoyable to watch.

So - for those of you looking for good hearted family entertainment - I strongly recommend The Phantom.  Hero - the Phantom's horse - is Roy Rodger's Trigger & The Lone Ranger's Silver rolled all into one.  Devil - thankfully played by a real wolf and not a spray painted German Shepherd - could easily outmatch Rin Tin Tin any day of the week.

And as to the future?  I for one - am anxiously awaiting the start of filming of ""The Phantom Legacy"" an Austrilian production - which - if the Ghosts of the Skull Cave smile upon us - is due to start filming sometine in 2009 or 2010.

Enjoy!!!",1247616000,3,1567,4.274576271186441

816558,4,6304224621,"""An old-fashioned adventure yarn"" is the best description of this modern-day comic book-hero-come to life-story. This is almost like one of those early Tim Burton directed-Batman type adventures without all the darkness. The language is mild, the special-effects are decent and the sound is good. Best of all is the scenery, some beautiful landscapes filmed in Thailand and Australia.

Instead of the city being where our comic book hero performs his heroics, this is out in the jungle, more like an Indiana Jones-type story. It's fast-moving, it's hokey, it's unrealistic but its generally fun to watch. Even the villain (""Xander Drax"" played by Treat Williams) isn't really all nasty.

""The Phantom"" (Billy Zane) has the normal off-and-on corny romance situation with feminist-journalist  ""Diana Palmer"" (Kristy Swanson) and the film gives you an entertaining 100 minutes.

816561,5,6304224621,"This action-adventure movie based on Lee Falk's comic strip, The Phantom, has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. Set in the 1930s, the film is loosely based on the first two Phantom stories, ""The Singh Brotherhood"" and ""The Sky Band"". The film tells us the story of Kit Walker, the 21st Phantom, and his attempts to prevent the rich madman Xander Drax from obtaining a weapon of doom, the Skulls of Touganda, possession of which will give him the secret to ultimate power and world domination. Directed by Simon Wincer, the film stars Billy Zane, Kristy Swanson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Treat Williams and James Remar. Joe Dante(Gremlins) and Joel Schumacher(Batman Forever) were originally offered directorial duties for the movie but the duties were passed onto Simon Wincer; who-in my opinion-did a wonderful job with the movie. The movie suffered the same fate as two other comic book/pulp adaptations at the time, The Shadow and The Rocketeer, and did not fare very well at the box office  It's one of those movies I wish a sequel were made to. It kinda reminded of the Indy Jones movies somehow. I never read the comic strip myself but I found this movie to be a real delight.",1219449600,,1187,4.790243902439024

""The ghost who walks"" is embodied by Billy Zane who captured the mysterious and at the same time the spirit of the personage with astonishing naturalness. Although the enormous resemblance between him and Val Kilmer, he develops a fine performance. Kristy Swanson is credible like Lily Palmer and Catherine Zeta Jones makes her final launch before being recognized in ""The mask of Zorro"" two years later.

The rest obeys to the well known formulas. A lot of action, revenge and mystery; greed and ambition will lead us through two continents in hydroplane with a good dose of humour all the way through.

Spectacular hair raising sequence, specially the initial one of the truck on the bridge, which would seem to pay homage to Indiana Jones.

This is a good movie to just sit down, pop some popcorn and watch on a cool rainy autum night when you don't want to do much.  Not hard to follow, and as always, a happy ending.  Also This is the first real superhero character that I have seen that uses guns, so he looses his mystique to me. I would have been just as happy if he used a whip, throwing stars, or something else manual, not a gun.  Only comic book characters like the punisher who is very mortal and seeking vengence should use guns, but not this migical, strong, mysterious hero who is supposed to come from a jungle background. Sure he was educated in New York, but it doesn't mean he has to use the City ways.  Other than that, good time killer, descent enough for 8-10 year olds to watch (not much blood/gore or swearing).

816754,4,6304224621,"It doesn't surprise me that ""The Phantom"" failed at the box office.  It lacked the star power of other films of that time, relied on the name recognition of a hero who isn't as flashy as Batman, Spiderman, or a multitude of other characters, and, honestly, it wasn't summer blockbuster material.  Perhaps if it came out in the dead of winter when most studios toss out their artsy flicks hoping for Oscar recognition, it would have done better.

With that said, I have to admit that ""The Phantom"" is a wonderful flick to watch.  Granted, it doesn't have flying heroes or webslingers, but it does have a wonderful story to it in the classic vein of those old 1930's cliffhangers.  Billy Zane is game as Kit Walker/Phantom.  He has that classic Hollywood look to him that makes him perfect for the role.  Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy) does a wonderful job as Diane Palmer, the damsel in not-so-much-distress.  Catherine Zeta Jones, James Remar, and the underrated Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa head up a stellar supporting cast.  The real ""treat"" here, however, is Treat Williams as Xander Drax, the evil mastermind behind all of the Phantom's problems in this film.  He's completely over the top, delivering smug lines like, ""Show me the power!"" with enough cinematic flair that you can't help but love his devilish character.

The story involves the search for three skulls:  one of bronze, one of jade, and one of gold, that will give their owner ultimate power.  Drax, being the power-hungry man that he is, is on the hunt for these three skulls.  The only things in his way are the Sang Brotherhood, who are responsible for creating the Phantom many centuries ago, and the Phantom himself.  The tale bounces from the lush jungles of Africa (but actually Australia and the backlots of California) to the mean streets of 1930's New York City, and then to the dreaded Devil's Vortex.  It's full of swashbuckling, gunplay, high adventure, and a few explosions.

The cinematography is brilliant, capturing the beauty of the Australian locations it was filmed on.  The blues and greens fill the TV screen wonderfully, and the vibrant purple of Phantom's suit supplies a wonderful contrast to the deep greens and browns of the jungles.

Overall, there isn't too much that's offensive in this flick for youngsters.  The language does get a little bit strong for the younger lot, but if you let your kids watch recent the recent PG-13 hero flicks, I'm sure they can handle this one.  There is quite a bit of violence, including a couple of impalings, but all of it is done in a way that is no worse than most other superhero films.

I highly recommend this flick to fans of films like ""The Shadow"" and ""The Rocketeer,"" as well as most other superhero flicks.  It might take awhile to get beyond the VERY purple outfit that our hero wears in this flick, but it's all played out with great intentions and a nod to the classic cliffhangers from long ago.",1152057600,25,2942,4.748031496062992

816757,5,6304224621,"This is the most pleasing 'Myth' that I've had the pleasure of watching. 2 years after the underated ""THE SHADOW"" left it's mark, THE PHANTOM surfaced.

The Phantom is different, and in some ways similiar to the movie that came before it.

This one had a much bigger budget of course. But both movies had the unlucky outcome of only raking in little or half-profit from the theaters.

I think this movie is a classic story. It takes place somewhere around the 1930's where a legend ' the ghost who walks' waits to hear of evil doers than goes out on his trusty white steed to thwart his enemies. Living in the jungle, he also has with him a wolf who, now that I think of it, is named shadow.

In real life, he is Kit walker, a rich playboy who loves city-livin'. It is true that this is the umpteen time that the hero has had an alter ego or dual personalities, like in BATMAN, SUPERMAN, THE SHADOW, ZORRO, and many others. But, what makes this story different is the fact that the myth behind The Phantom is that no matter how many people kill him . . . he keeps come back. Better than he was before.

One man, Xander Drax, plans to harness a group of ancient skull artifacts that are derived from THE PHANTOM'S home in the jungle. What is unexpected is what kind of power will these skulls possess once they are combined.

This movie is a classic rebirth of the serial so many years ago. It pays tribute to the plup comics, like THE SHADOW, and both characters are perfectly different.

But they both depend on putting fear into their enemies.

And they both weild dual pistols. I guess that's why people pair these two movies together.

But, If I had to choose between the two, I would go with this one. It really is a definite good buy with a little touch of film noir.

816871,3,6304224621,"You are never going to mistake ""The Phantom"" for anything more than campy fun, but it is enjoyable campy fun.  Billy Zane is just a bit goofy in the role.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the not-quite-bad bad girl Sala.  Kristy Swanson, of the original ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" movie, is swaggering girl friend Diana Palmer.  She reminds me of Princess Leia in the first Star Wars movie.  Treat Williams is corny bad guy Xander Drax.  None of these actors treat their roles seriously, and there is enough over-acting for two movies, but it all seems intentional.

We learn at the beginning of the movie that most of these characters have a history that begins well before this movie.  Quill (Patrick Remar) has even killed the Phantom once.  Later we find that a lot of people have killed the Phantom.  It is sort of like a rite of passage for bad guys (and a throwaway one-liner).  Of course, we know the Phantom can not be killed.

Xander Drax has attained an idea from ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  Find three mysterious skulls and achieve a power greater than any known to man.  The skulls are really cool.  When you find two of them, they burn a hole in a map to point the way to the third.  Far more efficient than having them point in a center direction so that it takes a significant portion of the movie to find the next skull.  Instead, we zip to the island, having a big fight, kill some people off and move on.  However, I am getting ahead of myself.

At the outset of this movie we recognize how fun it is going to be.  The bad guys force a boy to drive a truck a rickety hanging bridge (perhaps another carry-over from ""Temple of Doom"").  The bridge threatens to break, but the boy makes it across.  During the bad guy's escape they force the boy to drive across again, but this time the bridge really does start to break and the Phantom has to rescue himself and the boy.

There are later fun scenes with the Phantom rescuing Diana from a ship and escaping in a plane.  We have seen hundreds of cowboys drop from a building or a rock into a saddle.  How about the Phantom dropping from a biplane into a saddle?  The Phantom heads to New York City, proving that jungle people can survive in the Big Apple.  After all, the Big Apple is just another kind of jungle.  Billy Zane even gets to slide down elevator cables and escape just in the nick of time.

This movie has all the elements of a fun adventure movie.  The characters have just the right combination of believability and unbelievability that the entertainment factor is high.  When people get hurt it is so cartoonish that you never can keep their injury in perspective.  The only drawback is that the original Phantom comics were never that campy.

There are some downsides to this movie.  The plot seems to borrow way too many elements from the Indiana Jones movies, especially from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  As noted above, the camp factor was high.  This movie may have been too campy for fans of the original Phantom; not as extreme as the difference between the original Batman comics and the campy 1960s series, but similar.

One interesting and fun choice for supporting actors was Patrick McGoohan as the Phantom's Dad.  McGoohan is a wonderful actor with credits in both television and movies.

A viewer will not mistake this movie for something with Academy Award potential.  The movie is way too derivative.  However, it is highly entertaining as long as you do not analyze it too much.

that the entire family can enjoy time and again, then THE PHANTOM
is a standout choice. Released in 1996, the Paramount blockbuster
commemorated the 60th anniversary of Lee Falk's classic comic
strip about ""The Ghost Who Walks"" and his fearless escapades,
crowning the special achievement in grand style.

Smart enough to place this film solidly in the 1930s, director
Simon Wincer and scriptwriter Jeffrey Boam deliver a powerhouse
roller-coaster ride which sweeps us around the world and back

superb symphonic soundtrack of David Newman, THE PHANTOM
is a globetrotting delight of swashbuckling derring-do. From
the deeps of Africa to New York City, further into uncharted
waters and undisclosed powers, the film is a dynamite
blend of cliffhanger and coming-of-age thriller, with
just the right touch of love story imperiled to stir the
pot even finer.

With Kristy Swanson feisty and formidible as the strip's
longtime female lead, and hearty nemesis Catherine
Zeta-Jones displaying the depth & dash which has since
propelled her career into the highest honors and many
hallmark performances, this film leaves you breathless.
Add Treat Williams, cute but dangerously cutting as THE
PHANTOM's arch-nemesis, along with legendary master
Patrick McGoohan adding a gleefully tart literal touch
to the legend of ""The Ghost Who Walks"", and the drama
gets even deeper.

Give up the ultimate props to Billy Zane in the highly
demanding lead role, which he delivers with a vengeance.
Dynamic in wit, disarming in charm, and a dramatic
knockout as THE PHANTOM, Zane's performance conveys
the innocence of thecharacter, and the conviction of
his struggle, without turning him into a campy,
lantern-jawed lummox a la Adam West.
As physically prepared as he was dramatically equipped
for the horse-riding, canyon-swinging, crimebusting role,
Zane is a marvel to watch on the screen.

In the recent upswing of Hollywood films which treat
comic strip subjects more dramatically (and in a decidedly
less hokey manner), THE PHANTOM definitely stands with
Tim Burton's 1st BATMAN film as a direct predecessor for
the outstanding  live-action work being done currently
with the genre, especially when one considers the
Marvel-based films now on the market.

The only thing which would be better than simply seeing
this highly underrated film would be if Paramount would
finally do THE PHANTOM its just due as a deluxe DVD set.
With such a release, Paramount could finally issue the
very thorough documentary from A&E's BIOGRAPHY on
the strip, its creator, and the film, along with the HBO
FIRST LOOK featurette on the movie.
Neither item has been available on DVD, and packaging
this material with,  say, a special edition of this film
would be as welcome as it is overdue.

Considering that the film's 10th anniversary  -and THE
PHANTOM's 70th anniversary-  is due in 2006, the time
is ripe for a serious reappraisal of this highly
entertaining motion picture, and the idiom which
it represents so very well.",1092960000,6,3114,5.21

There's no irony or winking references here, which sets it apart from most other superhero movies. I liked it, but didn't love it, and I can fully understand if it's not to everyone's taste.

The plot revolves around a quest to find three sacred, and powerful, skulls that together form a powerful weapon.  To prevent the skulls from falling into the wrong hands the Phantom must travel to New York in his disguise as Mr. Walker (a play on The-Ghost-Who-Walks).
This is an excellent movie for swashbuckling fans with plenty of action and derring-do.  There is also the nice touch that the women are not helpless as we so often see in movies.  There are also little touches brought in from other movies and comic strips (but I'll let you see it to figure them out).

It's such a shame that the screenplay cannot be up to the standard set by the painstaking and meticulous production, soign to the tiniest details. The film starts off fine, with the introduction of the Phantom's story and his family's century-long rift with an evil-doing sect of buccaneers, which by the 1930s seeks to conquer a world then seething with dictators. The rhythm is fast-paced but the film's resolution is wishy-washy and perfunctory. The Phantom himself is very meek and for all his brawn, he lacks the crafty self-assertiveness of the Shadow or Indiana Jones, two characters this film harks back to. The four stars count only for the extraordinary effort of epoch recreation. The story itself is hardly worth two.",1075852800,,840,5.0503597122302155

I have never read the comicbook or comicstrip but from what I have read in the other reviews on this page, it is not 100% accurate to the feeling of the source material.  Nevertheless, it is a great, campy, fun filled movie.
  Catherine Zeta Jones and Kristy Swanson are very sexy as their supporting characters, and in fact give the best performances of the whole movie.  Treat Williams comes off as the campiest character of all in his portrayal of Xander Drax.  His one-liners could have been done without.  They were, however, not going for a very serious movie so you get what you get.  Billy Zane was enjoyable to watch as the title hero, and his alter ego Kit Walker but the script needed a little work.
  The plot of the movie revolved around the 21st in a long line of ""Phantoms"" and his quest to stop an archvillian from attaining three priceless skulls.  If Drax were to get his hands on all three skulls, he would become very powerful.  So, Kit (aka: The Phantom) sets out with his horse and wolf to capture Drax and reclaim the skulls.

My favorite continuity problem in the film: after Phantom and Swanson leap onto a horse from an airplane(!), watch for the wolf running behind. Sometimes it is in the scene, and sometimes it is not.

816987,5,6304224621,"To really appreciate the 1996 PHANTOM, it helps to know who he is: whereas other costumed heroes depend heavily on at least one super power and are forever in your face about it, the PHANTOM is the only one who relies on good genes, a white Palomino, a pet wolf, a loyal tribe of pygmy poison people (the Bandar), and a personal fortune to get him past bad times and bad people. He also has this stone fox of a girlfriend (Diana Palmer), a skull throne [THE Skull Throne], and the coolest home on the face of the earth, the Skull Cave.
Many ""super""-type heroes have elements of the PHANTOM's lifestyle: Batman, for instance, ripped off the Skull Cave with his Batcave and his wealth; but unlike the PHANTOM Batman isn't saving the world 24 hours a day. Batman clocks in at sundown, works all night, then sleeps it off the next day. Presumably, too, crime in Gotham City isn't always afoot; Batman, as billionaire socialite alter ego Bruce Wayne, mixes it up with the nation's wealthiest 1% whenever possible. And who built the Batplane, the Bat-o-cycle, the Batmobile, the Batboat, etc? If Batman's got his own pygmies building this stuff for him, let's see 'em! And what kind of ""hero"" ADOPTS a teenage boy (Robin) and votes Republican?
The PHANTOM, on the other hand, would drop everything to come to the aid of some pygmy whose ox ate too many dung beetles. When the Bandar have a bake sale, the PHANTOM bakes a pie. Diana been away for a month and hasn't had a chance to write? The PHANTOM broods for about two seconds and puts on a hat, sunglasses, and a checkered trenchcoat, leaves town for the States, and breaks heads until he finds her and knows she's OK. Is that love or what?
Batman, as I mentioned, definitely uses his wealth to give him an edge over the bad guys in the application of technology to whatever skills he's otherwise developed, such as detective work (including working undercover and surveillance) and crime scene analysis. Batman applies his wealth to his own defense as well--the miniaturized gas masks, the canisters of chemicals in his utility belt to bail him out of an endless array of tight jams, and the aforementioned Bat-vehicles aren't cheap. And when he's not sleeping, eating, socializing, and home-schooling Dick Grayson, he's MAKING REPAIRS on all these things. Presumably. And what's with the smoking jacket?
The PHANTOM, on the other hand, is wealthy like nobody's business. In his Treasure Room he has, among other things: a goblet cut from a single diamond once owned by Alexander the Great; the Golden Fleece; Excalibur; The Holy Grail; and a specially-designed display case with a single, slightly withered apple inside with two bites taken out of it! I think he has a LITTLE LULU collection in there somewhere too. What impresses me, though, is that with all these chests full of precious stones and jewels and coins and all the rest, this guy is as rich as Scrooge McDuck and you'd never know it.
When he's not out in the world actively opposing bad people on behalf of the innocent, he's doing community service or speaking to schoolkids about the rule of law. And when there is NOTHING to do, he sits on that Skull Throne waiting to spring into action. No fancy weaponry, just a couple of pistols and a right-handed punch hard enough to leave the permanent impression of his skull ring on whatever bad guy's jaw it lands on. No ""PHANTOM car/boat/bike/copter/plane"" either--just one great big white horse he takes everywhere. Now you know.",1050192000,4,3491,4.733990147783251
816988,3,6304224621,"Actually, this wasn't a bad little summer flick. One thing that may have doomed it at the box office was the choice of the hero; if the Phantom is not the original hero in tights (he definitely predates Batman, and probably Superman as well) he's definitely the only one of the originals who has survived into contemporary times, but even so he's never been as popular or as familiar as the classic heroes (such as those of the DC and Marvel comics stables) who have come later. At any rate, in order to really appreciate this movie you may have to suspend your critical faculties just a bit; this isn't great cinema, and it isn't striving to be great cinema. The acting is deliberately a bit over the top (Treat Williams and Catherine Zeta-Jones put in wonderful performances as two of the villians), and the movie always seems to be looking at you over its shoulder to give you a reassuring wink to let you know it's not taking itself too seriously, and neither should you. Billy Zane is adequate as the hero, but the sterling performances are those of Williams, Zeta-Jones, Kristy Swanson (as The Phantom's feisty love interest) and Patrick McGoohan as the ghost of the last Phantom.

817087,4,6304224621,"First off, let me reccomend the first Phantom movie, a serial made in the 40's with TOM TYLER who was also the mummy in one of the mummy movies and CAPTAIN MARVEL in a serial before this one but best known as the star in a bunch of old b&w westerns.  Also I want to say (because Batman creator/co creator Bob Kane didn't but would claim he invented sliced bread if he thought he'd get away with it no doubt) like Zorro before him,THE PHANTOM had a secret cave headquarters, had a butler of sorts and was the FIRST masked hero in tights too. Basicaly he's part Tarzan and part Batman.  NO boy sidekick but he does have a pet wolf and a great horse as his aids in fighting evil.  The story is a bit of an effort to go with an Indiana Jones like flavor, many consider this movie a flop but The Phantom hasn't been seen much in the USA since the 60's and his heyday was the 30's and 40's like THE SHADOW.  The newspaper strip has only been in 500 papers these days so it's not like he's seen as much as the PEANUTS kids who're in maybe 5 or 10 times as many papers. Who knows, sometime even movie characters so well known NOW may meet this fate decades from now. I reccomend this movie to any fan of super heroes period.  It's as good as THE ROCKETEER in my opinion.  Billy Zane is great as the Phantom and Lee Falk who created the strip as well as Mandrake the Magician strip, once hugely popular, thought so.  The Indy trimmings story doesn't hurt it at all. I know the buffs will want to crucify me for saying this but I feel it's too true these days....see the USA box office for THE PHANTOM and THE SHADOW, both good movies if you don't believe it. Spielburg or Lucas could do a Tarzan or Captain Marvel a.k.a. Shazam movie but how many people would line up in multitudes for it 'eh?  As the characters are NOT popular now as they had been decades ago (when the character's name alone would attract hundreds of thousands and more), only the director's name OR Disney's would be the primary attraction.  I know the Phantom character is huge in Australia and more popular in Europe than in the USA, that's swell, I'm glad.  Anyway, see it!",1025568000,3,2138,4.24384236453202

My family and I saw this film in the theatre and was so impressed that we invited others to go back with us for a second time!  I must admit though, the first time we saw it, we had gone to see another movie that ended up being sold out, so we opted to see ""The Phantom"" sort of by default.  What a pleasant surprise!
Now it's one of our all-time favorites, and what a treat to have it on DVD on the Big-Screen at home!
Others may not agree, but as far as I'm concerned, this is Billy Zane's best character of all the films I've seen him in!  He's the perfect fit, making one of my comic book favorites come to life!
Treat Williams is great as the ""smooth"" bad guy, and some of the island scenes are breath-taking!
The action is non-stop and there's just enough romance without being mushy.

However hackneyed the plot may be, however, it is fun, and there are just enough good action scenes and impressive effects to cover the film's flaws.

Billy Zane, better known as Cal Hockley the evil fiancee in Titanic, is absolutely stellar in this movie.  I realize that the sinking boat movie helps pay his bills, but the role was certainly beneath him.  The Billy Zane in the sinking boat movie is a corpse compared to the Billy Zane in the Phantom.  Yes, it is that different!
Second, the sets were superbly, beyond the sets seen in other 1930's films such as the Shadow, or even *gulp* Indiana Jones.  Except for the Pirates of the Caribbean set at the end of the movies, but the city scenes are stelar for any art deco afficionados.
Thirdly, Hitchcock observed that heroes and villains are almost indistinguishable.  We have created anti-heroes and gentelman villains (ie Wolf Larsen and Hannibal Lecter).  You actually root for Zane/Phantom.
The Bad:  There were several things wrong with the film.  First, some of the stunts seemed to be rehashed Indiana Jones stunts.  Writers, please try to stretch yourself and come up with new ideas!  Second,  Mr. Drax, the villain, beside using the name of a 007 villain (Moonraker), he was not believable as a criminal mastermind.  He was too much of a mouth.  Maybe different casting.  Third, the cinematography was nonexistent.  Good cinematography can maker a film, as n Lang's ""M.""
In conclusion, this was a nice surprise.  They had a lot going for the film, the franchise/name recognition, a great actor, good sets, few if no anachronisms, no Nazi's.

The simple fact is that The Phantom could have been good entertainment, but it's so poorly written, directed, and acted, I have to wonder why the film was greenlighted in the first place.
Sure, the prospect of an Indiana Jones-type film is a fun idea, but it's nowhere in the vein of the the films in that series; it never generates any thrills or genuine fun.  The action sequences are simply too routine and are occasionally terribly choreographed.
As for the script, it's been a while since I've heard dialogue this hackneyed.  It makes the recent Mission to Mars look like something written by David Mamet in comparison.  The plot's also fairly ridiculous and is done with a touch of camp, but nowhere near enough to at least make the movie so bad it's almost enjoyable to watch.  I can't believe Jeffrey Bowman doesn't show any of the creative touches he put in The Last Crusade.
Performances, the less said the better.  The only guy who does a fine job is Billy Zane, and though he never always convinces as a superhero, he's charismatic enough to make the experience bearable.  Treat Williams as the villain overacts to an extent I would rather not describe.  Catherine Zeta Jones also shamelessly hams it up with a cheesy accent; I bet she's taken this film out of her resume.  As for Kristy Swanson, I guess we can tell why she won't nowhere.

The supporting cast, which includes a 'pre-Zorro' Catherine Zeta-Jones, move around spiritlessly within the confines of their  individual roles in a way that would best be described as mobile oblivion.  Kristy Swanson once again plays a rich girl love interest, a role for which  she is often typecast (think 'The Chase', 'The Program', 'Buffy the Vampire  Slayer'.).  But the real appeal of the movie is the appearance of Billy  Zane in the lead role.  Rarely have I seen the actor play a good guy, and  in his role as the Phantom, he plays it well.  In fact, he shines like a  diamond.  Not to mention the fact that he does a helluva lot of justice to  a purple wet suit and a black mask!  Overall, the movie captures the spirit  of the old comic book in a way that is very pleasing to the senses.",957830400,2,898,4.45679012345679
817233,5,6304224621,"This film astonishes me.  With utter garbage coming out in the Batman series, how could this film fail at the box office?
Much more talented actors who actually seem to care about their characters excel in this film!  Billy Zane & Kristy Swanson are two of the best (though underrated)  actors out there today!
Although I haven't really followed the Phantom  comic strip too closely I have read up on it after seeing the film for the  umpteenth time.  It appears to be quite true to the comic strip.
This  film has action, great scenery, beautiful women, a great superhero, what  more can one ask for?  A better villan perhaps.  Treat Williams was not  spectacular in this film, but tolerable.  I just wish the Brotherhood's  evil was portrayed a little darker perhaps?
The DVD has only the trailer  included.  It would have been nice for some extra features like interviews  or a making of featurette (of which I am certain they have) as this one's  going to be a Cult favorite in the years to come.",956707200,,1000,4.590909090909091
817234,5,6304224621,"This is a great movie for the family. Just Fun. Indiana Jones meets Batman.
I have never read the comics, but I enjoyed all of the performances. Treat Williams as Xander Drax was excellent. Just enough fun  and evil in one package. Catherine Zeta Jones (Douglas) Plays the  villianess darkly with enough ""good girl"" to keep us interested.  Billy Zane has this hero thing down. (You remember him from Titanic as the  evil fiance).
If you don't want to own this one, just rent it one night  instead of Indiana Jones or Batman and you  will not be disappointed.",955324800,3,558,4.585858585858586
817235,5,6304224621,"Having been a reader of Lee Falk's classic newspaper comic strip on which this film is based,I was prepared to be disappointed as the translation from one medium to another can sometimes be problematic. Having gone in  with those reservations, I'm happy to say that this is a very entertaining  movie that respects its source material and embellishes upon it in the way  only a big-budget Hollywood film can. Billy Zane is terrific as the  mysterious ""Ghost who walks"". This film only received luke-warm  reviews from the top name film critics but merited more consideration. If  you liked The Shadow or The Mask of Zorro,this movie is one worth checking  out.",949708800,10,660,4.891891891891892
817236,5,6304224621,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I had heard comments that it was boring and slow. Well, let me tell you: IT IS NOT SO! It's a great, fun movie. It has great action sequences, great humor and great  performances.
The title role is played by Billy Zane, and he is completly  believable as The Phantom/Kit Walker. Handsome, charming, VERY athletic,  muscular (he looks great in that purple outfit ;D) and all the superhero  character qualities as well: kind, honest, courteous, the whole package.  Kristy Swanson plays the love interest, Diana Palmer. I liked the fact that  she's not some silly damsel in distress that spends the whole movie  screaming for help. Instead Diana's a strong, corageous and intelligent  woman. Very good example for girls. The villain is Xander Drax, played well  by Treat Williams, and the villaness is played by Catherine Zeta Jones. All  in all, very good perfomances.
Another fine element in this movie is the  scenery. Wow! Beautiful landscapes and locations, exquisite beaches with  glorious blue-green waters, the breathtaking jungle...makes you wish you  could be there. Believe me, it's amazing, and worth seeing more that  once.
The movie stays true to the spirit of the comic strip it is based  on (which is such a rare achievement for a Hollywood movie).  Parents  can rest easy with this movie, it good clean fun for kids, it's not very  violent, and no foul language. Plus, you'll enjoy it as much as the  kids.
All in all, a VERY good movie, that I fully recomend to everyone.",949449600,12,1536,4.816091954022989

7865511,4,6304224621,"No smoking in the Skull Cave. After Burtons 1989 Batman there was a scramble to produce pulp & comic properties some old and some just  retro like: The Shadow, the Rocketeer, Dick Tracy. None, including this one, were particularly successful at the box office (45mil budget w/ 17 mil gross). The Phantom, a.k.a. KITT Walker, a.k.a. the Ghost Who Walks, was part of generations of jungle protectors, kind of a black Panther with a gun, horse and a wolf. He must leave his African superhero comfort zone to travel to NYC to stop an ancient order of evil from uniting 3 skulls that will have some kind of dire consequences.  Billy Zane is perfect as a beefy Saturday matinee idol type, Kristy Swanson is less perfect as his bantering lady partner, Diana Palmer. Treat Williams is delightfully  over the top as the big bad, Drax, James Remar is his lackey, Catherine Zeta-Jones is the sexy muscle by Draxs side. Patrick McGoohan has some fatherly bits as the original Phantom.",1525478400,,972,4.739644970414201
