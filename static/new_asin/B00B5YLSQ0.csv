8563091,1,B00B5YLSQ0,"Definitely not worth the cost or the time spent watching it.  It is not about the D600.  Rather is is rehash of material he did on other cameras and a purported introduction to digital photography. The material on digital photography is simple minded in the extreme.  There is much ""talking head""  by The Maven and few  illustrations or photos shown to illustrate the points made.  Production values in the long video range from low to nonexistent.  I am giving it one star because I do not see a way to give it no stars.",1416355200,,521,4.4787234042553195
8563092,5,B00B5YLSQ0,"Excellent DVD,the first hour is a very useful basic education. I would recommend any DVD this author has for other cameras,I was lost before viewing multiple times.",1414972800,,164,5.111111111111111

8563095,5,B00B5YLSQ0,"The Nikon D600 crash course is a very comprehensive and easy to understand course particularly for people who are new to photography.
It not only concentrates on the operation of the D600 by taking you through it's many features, buttons and menus, but it also gives you practical examples on the ""Basics of photography"" such as composition elements.
As someone who has invested a lot of money on an excellent piece of engineering I fully recommend you purchase this course to compliment your learning.
Michael Andrew is an excellent tutor and I will be looking at many of the other photographic DVDS he has to offer.
Whilst you may feel that this DVD is a bit pricey it represents value for money.",1393027200,,698,4.729508196721311
8563096,5,B00B5YLSQ0,"I purchased my Nikon D600 several months ago and quickly became overwhelmed by it. The instruction manual made absolutely no sense to me. I finally gave up and tucked the camera away for safe keeping.

I came across the Nikon D600 Crash Course Training Tutorial on Amazon.com and figured I had nothing to lose. I knew I had made a great purchase only after watching the first lesson. The information presented was easy to understand and very informative.

You could tell the teacher had many years of experience and was extremely knowledgeable. He made the lessons fun and I began to regain my enthusiasm for my camera.

My photography skills have made leaps and bounds from when I first watched the Nikon D600 Crash Course. I feel like I have saved myself years by using this video. The best part is when I ever run into an issue or have a question I can refer to the DVD and it's broken down in such a way that it is easy for me to find my answer.

I also went to the instructor's website [...] and purchased the Photoshop Crash Course DVD and the Advanced Photography Techniques DVD. Best purchases ever made! I tried to using Photoshop before and wanted to pull my hair out. If you have tried to use this program then you might know the feeling :) The DVD made Photoshop a cake walk for me. Highly recommend it! Advanced Photography Techniques has taken my images to the next level and is extremely valuable tool if you are wanting to become a professional photographer.

Best part is last week one of my photos was published in the newspaper! I have become a big fan of Michael Andrew's training products and would recommend them to my close friends. Best of luck to all those aspiring photographers out there!",1366243200,3,1715,4.5372168284789645
8563097,5,B00B5YLSQ0,"After purchasing, and attempting to use a very complex piece of photographic machinery, namely a Nikon D600, I quickly learned that I lacked the skills necessary to get the the desired results with my new DLSR. While I feel I am capable to go through the manual and learn through trial and error, it was the time that took that made the process impossible. Between work and family I realized I just didn't have the free time and wanted to start getting results right away.

I did some internet searches and found many different training videos on the Nikon D600, but the D600 Crash Course, stood out to me in that 1. The DVD was actually more expensive than the others, 2. That it was also much longer than the others (3.5 hours instead of 1-2) and 3. That it was taught by a professional photographer and 4. That a friend of mine had used a similar training video for another camera and was happy with the purchase.

While the $40 cost is more than other training videos, I now understand why and can say without a doubt, this was an absolutely fantastic investment:

1. Michael is an excellent teacher, very engaging yet informal, much like having a good friend teach you.
2. His lessons are also very short and to the point, usually in the 2-3 minute range, some longer, some shorter, but the bite sized lessons were very effective.
3. There is an elaborate menu system that allowed me to jump to different lessons for review. Extremely helpful.
4. The section on Portraits was outstanding and immediately after viewing this, I saw the results I was wanting in my own images.
5. There was not a single, major function on the camera that was not covered in detail.
6. The first section includes Michael's photography school. While I knew many things from there already, I learned much more and it was a valuable asset to the course.
7. Many examples of actual images using the techniques described. Very useful and instructive.

There were a few things I noticed that some may not like:

1. Some of the audio is a little unbalanced. It may be louder during one lesson, and not so much during another. Not too big of a big deal.
2. I wanted a little more information about video shooting, however all of the basics including live view and focusing in live view were covered.
3. Some of the pacing is a little quick. There were times I wished MIchael spent more time on different subjects. I just re-watched.
4. The first hour or so focuses on the core photography basics. Crucial for beginning photographers, while more advanced shooters may not be interested in it .The remaining of the video (about 3 hours) focuses on the D600 itself.

Overall, this is an absolutely excellent product. I was so pleasantly surprised that I felt I must leave a review. I realized after watching it, it was in fact a better investment than the camera itself because that knowledge sticks and can be used with other cameras as well. Highly Recommended!",1366156800,5,2936,4.604206500956023
8563098,5,B00B5YLSQ0,"The Nikon D600 is the first ""nice"" camera I have ever bought.  However my excitement soon dissipated when upon its arrival I became overwhelmed by all the features & capabilities it possessed.  Sure I could read the screen/manual, but it read as a foreign language to me.  My frustration grew to the point that I continued using my old camera instead of learning the new one.

Thankfully, my whole attitude & experience has been changed because I found this DVD by Michael the Maven.  While researching to find a more effective way to learn the intricacies of my camera, I came across Michael Andrew's Crash Courses.  I decided to buy the one for my camera & I'm so glad I did.  The information that was complicated & overwhelming in the manual was presented clearly & laid out simply by Michael Andrew.

Michael's teaching style felt friendly & familiar, to the point I found myself learning with ease.  The well placed examples used by Michael (to teach certain aspects) really helped me not only learn but also retain much of the material.  I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of information covered.  It is amazing to me that such an abundance of information could be explained so simply, yet with complete attention to the details of the subject matter.

I also love how quickly I can navigate through the DVD's Menu to refer to a subject I need more work on.  Thanks to this DVD I finally understand my camera's ins and outs.  I now understand the language of the Nikon D600, & have felt my confidence soar.  I now know how to use the plethora of settings on my camera, when they should be used, & how to adjust them.  It is impossible to relay just how much I have learned in this review, but as a result my pictures have dramatically improved & so has my experience.  It was well worth the money & I am planning on purchasing other Michael the Maven products so that I can keep growing.  I feel like I have found THE photography secret / shortcut!!!  Thank you Michael Andrew for making this fun to learn!",1365465600,9,2018,4.524861878453039
8563099,3,B00B5YLSQ0,"Three stars by Amazon's definition equals ""It's okay"".  That is a spot on description of this video, or more accurately, this compilation of separate videos, edited component style into one title.  If you're familiar with YouTube, that's pretty much what you get here.  A guy with some amount of knowledge on a subject, sitting on a couch, camera set up in front of him, telling you about the subject at hand.  At times, he will go sit on stairs, or (rarely) do a segment more ""on location"".  It ends up being very much like you asked your neighbor to take a Saturday afternoon to show you what he knows about a D600, whom you know has done some wedding shoots for friends, and has owned a D600 for 6 months.

Do not confuse this product with a professional course on the D600 and photography.  There is scant professionalism to be found here.  But the course is truthfully titled as a ""Crash Course on the D600, made for beginners"".  If they had tacked ""presented by an Intermediate"" onto the end of the title, that would would have made it completely truthful.  You glean a measure of information in this video, and if I talked my neighbor into showing me the basics of the D600 on a Saturday, I would definitely owe him a night out for a steak dinner, so the price of under 40 bucks is OK.

Summary:  The bottom line is that while I did get some information out of this video, I'm going to have to purchase an additional class just on the basics of the D600, let alone something to get any advanced user knowledge.  But again, it is titled ""Crash Course"".  To give you some idea of how much cutting and pasting has gone into this production, the presenter's hair cuts include: Shaved head; Buzz cut; Below-the-ear, Semi-Hippy; Flat-top w/ Elvis side burns; and maybe some variations in between.  The point is, this is a paste-together production, and is inherently lacking because if it.  Three stars is probably being a tad generous.",1361664000,6,1937,4.554913294797688
