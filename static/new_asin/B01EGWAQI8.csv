8758720,4,B01EGWAQI8,"KADETTEN is a highly entertaining and rather subtler than usual piece of film-making by the legendary Nazi director Karl Ritter. Ritter is mainly remembered for his ""Zeitfilms,"" which were so contemporary they occasionally became outdated by the time they were released (see BESATZUNG DORA); this is a straight historical piece, and quite a good one despite its obvious ulterior motive: to educate the German youth in the necessity of fighting and dying for Germany.

The time is 1760, and Frederick the Great is at war with most of the rest of Europe. The Russian army, pitiless Cossacks in the service of the Tsar Catherine the Great, have occupied Berlin. All the older boys have marched out with Frederick's army, but one hundred child cadets, aged six to twelve are captured in their military school in Spandau. The boys are placed under the command of a renegade German in the service of the Tsar, one Rittmeister von Tzlow (Matthias Wieman), and treated with terrible cruelty, as are all the civilians in the town (indeed, this movie does a great job of making you hate the Russians). It turns out the bitter, hateful Tzlow has a fairly legitimate grudge against Frederick the Great and has decided to turn coat and give his former countrymen the boot as payment for his ill-treatment. Over the course of time, however, Tzlow is moved by the heroic spirit of resistance which exists among the ""Kadetten,"" which leads to a fateful series of events. The boys escape, arm themselves and seize a fortress in the countryside, daring the Cossacks to come and take them. Tasked with crushing the revolt, Tzlow must make a choice between his foreign masters and his desire for vengeance against his king, and the sense of patriotism the boys' heroism has rekindled in his heart.

If you know anything about the Nazis, you know how much they idolized Frederick the Great -- they certainly made enough movies about him and the era in which he lived. KADETTEN is a fine addition to those films. Ritter's goal was clearly to inflame the German youth, meaning the Hitler Youth, with the spirit of martial courage and sacrifice necessary to win the coming war, and he couldn't have chosen a better subject than this real-life revolt of the cadets. It is said that among the Hitler Youth KADETTEN was their favorite movie produced by the regime, and it's easy to see why. Nearly all boys fantasize about war at some point in their development, and KADETTEN allowed them to vicariously experience their heroic war-fantasies on film. Tragically, hundreds of thousands of these kids would go on to serve in the very real war that came in 1939 (the same year this movie was shot), and die in it.

Having said that, I must admit this is quite a decent movie in its own right and worth a watch for any fan of period-pieces, war movies or German cinema generally.",1527379200,,2848,4.772819472616633

8758722,5,B01EGWAQI8,"Karl Ritter's 1939 film 'Kadetten' was eventually released in 1941 because of it's anti Russian sentiment; the Nazi/Soviet pact ensured that it was shelved until Operation Barbarossa.

The plot , based on a true story, sees Berlin in 1760 invaded by Russian forces while Frederick The Great and his army are in Silesia. A particularly savage Cossack unit take a hundred army cadets hostage and march them east. What follows is a story of bravery, courage, resilience and, in the case of one of the major characters (played by Mathias Wieman) redemption through the ultimate self sacrifice.

Watching this film is all the more eerie when one considers that the boys playing the cadets, pupils from the Potsdam Napola Academy, were
more than likely to see action in reality a few years later and, most likely, to lose their lives. In fact Klaus Detlef Sierk who plays one of the cadets (son of famed director Douglas Sirk) was to lose his life on the Eastern Front in early 1944 aged just eighteen. Tragic sad and a
haunting thought when one sees him in this film. Others of note who appear include Carsta Lock, an actress who appeared in a number of Ritter productions and Andrews Engelmann (playing the ruthless Cossack commander).

The print quality is excellent, crisp and clear as is the sound. The opening titles, however, seem to be new and replace the original German ones. In any case, an excellent film that I've watched innumerable times since I purchased it!",1468368000,2,1468,4.817460317460317
