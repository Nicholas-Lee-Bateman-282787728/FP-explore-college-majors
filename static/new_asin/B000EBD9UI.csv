2513256,5,B000EBD9UI,"Another beautiful job from the dear people at Warner! All the films included have been nicely mastered from fine prints, but ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" seems a little pale and a shade too dark. No disaster, though!

My only real complaint is that two more Tennessee Williams films owned by Warner have been left out of the box. Some people have been upset that titles like ""Boom"" and ""Summer and Smoke"" are not included. How could they possibly? They are owned by other companies. Warner Home Video can issue films made by MGM and Warner Bros.,but not those owned by Universal and Paramount. BUT...Warner do have the rights to ""The Glass Menagerie"" and ""Period of Adjustment""! Why these were not included in this box is a mystery! So please, Warner, do not forget to issue them as soon as possible! And with some good will from Universal and Paramount regarding ""Boom"" and ""Summer and Smoke"", the Tennessee Willams list of films would be complete on DVD! Well, I suppose we have to campaign for ""Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots"" too!",1146009600,6,1025,4.694444444444445
2513257,5,B000EBD9UI,"This review isn't of the great movies contained but the DVD set and their respective presentations.

first..let me say the bonus DVD ""Tennesse Williams South""...is exceptional..its a film made about and with him in 1974 and besides his own readings of his work , which are illuminating, it features legends like Burl Ives and Jessica Tandy re-creating his dialog..simply timeless!

now..onto the Discs/Movies

the bonus featurettes are all very well done however, seemingly shorter than they should/could be.  By that I mean...they have current interviews with Karl Malden and Eli Wallach for BABYDOLL and Rip Torn for Sweet Bird of Youth and the ever beautiful Jill St John for The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, and yet the amount of face time these actual stars of the films in question get is barely a line here or there?  Not that the featurettes aren't good...they are..it just seems they could be a could 10minutes longer each...

now...the opposite problem is in the second disc of Streetcar Named Desire....the feature length (90min) Elia Kazan: A directors Journey is wonderful..its a decade or so old but was done while he was still with us and his participation raised it above the level of talking heads documentaries of the day.  The strange thing is that the new featurettes on this disc feature way too much culled from the aforementioned feature.  I don't understand....WB has wonderful featurettes on all the movies that seem truncated and then BLOATS out the Streetcar featurettes with duplicate material from itself?  Only the current footage of Karl Malden saves the Streetcar featurettes from their own plagerism.

Now..the films themselves are all in very good shape considering they go back half a century.  I wasn't a particular fan of Tennesse Williams..but after viewing all these films and the bonus film...i most certainly put him in the genius category and am looking for more.

Also, the press is making a big deal about Marlon Brando's screen test which is being included in the Streetcar DVD bonus features...its only a curiosity , not amazing by any stretch.  What is far more interesting is Karl Malden's lovely memories of his friendship and admiration for Mr Brando....truly touching and mezmorizing.  Malden is a treasure of an actor who starred in more fine films than any but the most ardent fan would know as he was usually second billed...but he IS the star of this set.

Great American films and unlike Universals shameless packaging..WB continues to present these types of films lovingly with extras..oh yeah..and the commentaries aren't bad either...much to enjoy in this set.",1145750400,61,2618,5.06993006993007

Several of these titles (for instance, the amazing Night Of the Iguana) weren't available on official dvd up until now. So it is truly something to celebrate for fans of T. Williams film adaptations.

2513282,5,B000EBD9UI,"I saw everyone of these at the movie theatre in the fifties and sixties except Baby Doll. It turns out that Baby Doll is my favorite. I realize that the film versions were somewhat changed or toned down for the screen but I love everyone one of them. I was raised in the South and a lot of that world depicted here is gone..... culturally. The human qualities of Williams plays, however,  still stand and speak volumes. He and O'Neil and William Inge were America's finest playwrights. Most of the time a good job was done for the motion pictures especially by directors John Huston and Elia Kazan....

Tennessee Williams's plays were psychological explorations of the human soul.

The best here for me are, Night of the Iguana and Baby Doll and of course, ""Streetcar"". The acting and direction is superb throughout this whole collection...They don't write plays or make movies like this anymore. Not in America.  Too real....what we get mainly are comic book movies, with no guts and no soul...they just blow stuff up and make a lot of noise. Americans have always enjoyed stories where problems are solved with violence. There are other stories out there to be told, however...

2513284,3,B000EBD9UI,"I am hugely disappointed and wondering if it's just me or has anyone else experienced the problem I had with this set!  I ordered this set mainly because I wanted three of the titles only to find that one of them, ""Streetcar Named Desire,"" had been replaced with Kevin Costner's ""Untouchables!""  I'm not an expert, but I don't believe that the ""Untouchables"" is a Tennessee Williams' work.  Returning the set is not an option for me because of logistics involved.  The ease of returning items to Amazon depends largely on where you live and how you receive your mail since they only accept returns via UPS.

I'm giving the set three stars only because of the carelessness with which the items were packaged and not because of any problem with the remaining DVDs.  If a non-Williams title is going to be included in a set claiming to include certain titles by a certain author, then it should be so noted before said item goes to market.  WB needs to get its act together.  Since one can't be sure of what he/she will be getting, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this set if the listed titles are of great importance to you.",1285027200,3,1122,4.575

2513288,5,B000EBD9UI,"Tennessee Williams, along with the sensitivities of fine actors, enables us to empathize and identify with people--people who are recognizable to us.  These people are ordinary people with all of their flaws and occasional displays of grace.  Williams unflinchingly investigates the experiences that shape personalities.  He brings us face-to-face with the rawest human emotions, the demons that sometimes drive each of us, and the compassion that people can feel for even the unattractive, mean, and hurting people with whom we interact.  We may not have had the life experience Williams investigates in a play.  Williams shows us, however, the many layers of complex weaving that makes a human being.  We realize that the characterization in his play is not as cut-and-dried as we first thought. Are we seeing coping techniques and responses that we often mistakenly perceive as character weaknesses?  Is submerged pain expressed as physical brutality?  We can take with us the revelation that can find within us the ability to be more compassionate people.  And that we have just been shown another person's technique for survival.  ""South"" is a revealing interview of Williams and an informative, pleasurable time of watching him describe aspects of his life's work. This set of plays shines with the benchmarks performances of Elizabeth Taylor and Marlan Brando along with the unforgettable portrayals by Vivien Leigh and the inimitable Karl Malden and Burl Ives.",1244332800,2,1468,5.343478260869565

2513311,5,B000EBD9UI,"This is a terrific boxset, collecting six of the films based on Tennessee Williams's plays (plus another disc with the documentary ""Tennessee Williams' South""). All the films are transferred with great care, and look quite wonderful. And the films themselves are fascinating, because (with the exception of BABY DOLL), they're invariably sanitized, as the major studios (Warner Brothers, MGM) struggled to constrain the unfettered imagination of one of America's most floridly uninihibited playwrights. Yet Williams' reputation as one of the premiere writers for actors allows some classic performances, starting with Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, Karl Malden and Kim Hunter in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, one of the most potent displays of Method acting which helped to revolutionize American film and theater. Kazan's hyperbolic direction of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is tempered in BABY DOLL, possibly the most charming film in the set (with terrific performances from Carroll Baker, Karl Malden, Eli Wallach, and, most hilariously, Mildred Dunnock). It seems incredible that, at the time (1956), BABY DOLL was the most controversial film of its year, with condemnation and cries of ""filth"" being bandied about. But BABY DOLL is a comic interlude in Williams' career. CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is the most heavily censored, so that all the talk of mendacity makes the film seem mendacious, because no one is talking about what the film is really about. But all the actors go to town with their Southern accents, especially Elizabeth Taylor and Judith Anderson.

But if CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF seems antiseptic, that's nothing compared to SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, which is alternately lurid and dainty. To watch Geraldine Page rip through in an absolutely corrosive and riveting performance is to see one of America's greatest actresses at her peak. THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA is uneven, but, again, some of the performances (in particular, Richard Burton, Ava Gardner, and, especially, Deborah Kerr and Cyril Delevanti) are superb. The long sequence with Burton and Kerr talking about demons and love while Burton is tied in the hammock is one of the most poetic sequences in all of Williams, handled with great insight and power.

THE ROMAN SPRING OF MRS. STONE has worn well with the years, as Vivien Leigh gives an elegant performance as the aging woman desperate for love nad even more desperate for her dignity.

Of course, these are all works which could be done now with a greater fidelity to Williams' original texts, but it would be hard to beat the incredible performances, done (in many cases) in the original acting styles of the period (in STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, many of the original Broadway casts were also cast in the films). This is a chance to see some legendary actors in the classic parts which they made famous.",1172102400,9,2843,5.04468085106383
2513312,4,B000EBD9UI,"He may be considered the great American playwright of the 20th Century, but until I got the boxed set of DVDs featuring adaptations of his works, I had never really been exposed to Tennessee Williams.  This set of six movies gives a good sampling of Williams and shows why he got his reputation for both daring and excellence.

In chronological order by film date, the first film in the set (and probably the best) is A Streetcar Named Desire.  This story focuses on the interrelationship of three characters:  Blanche DuBois (played by Vivien Leigh), her sister Stella (Kim Hunter) and Stella's husband, Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando).  Blanche moves in with the couple, fleeing from scandal in her hometown and with only a weak grip on sanity.  The brutish Stanley is her natural antagonist, with Stella stuck in the middle.  Eventually, however, Blanche and Stanley will have to confront each other.

Though Blanche may be the main character, it is Stanley who steals the show due to Brando's wonderful performance.  After seeing this movie, I can understand how significant of an impact that Brando had in the world of movie acting; prior to Streetcar, acting performances like Brando's were quite rare.  This is a great film, and the only Williams movie I was really familiar with prior to watching, both due to its immortal scenes (""Stella!"") and the brilliant Simpsons musical adaptation (in ""A Streetcar Named Marge"").

Next is Baby Doll, with Karl Malden as an impoverished cotton-miller and Carroll Baker as his very young wife, the Baby Doll of the title.  She has been viewing her much older spouse with increasing contempt and has held him to a promise that they would not consummate their marriage until she turned 20, an event soon to happen.  Eli Wallach enters the film as both a business and romantic rival to Malden.  For the time this movie was made (1956), this film was sexually daring, and though not as explicit as modern movies, it still holds up well.

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof features Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) and Brick (Paul Newman) as a married couple on the edge.  A deep secret has kept them estranged and there is the additional complication of the impending death of Brick's very wealthy and dominating father.  Brick may be Big Daddy's favorite, but their problems threatens to cut Brick out of an inheritance he doesn't want; Maggie, however, has other ideas.

Newman is back in a different role in Sweet Bird of Youth as a young hustler who returns to his hometown as the lover/employee of an aging actress.  He is hopeful that she will help him make it big in Hollywood, but he is also interested in winning back his old girlfriend, a goal her corrupt political boss father will do anything to stop.

Night of the Iguana has Richard Burton as a drunken reverend turned third-rate tour guide winding up at a hotel run by the widow (Ava Gardner) of an old friend.  His job is threatened when a young tourist (played by Sue Lyons of Lolita fame) keeps trying to seduce him.  As things fall apart for him, it's up to the widow and an artist (Deborah Kerr) to keep him from destroying himself.

Finally, there is The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, featuring Vivien Leigh as a recently widowed actress who takes a young lover (played by an early Warren Beatty).  This is probably the weakest in the set, and the only one I felt rather bored while watching.

Actually, there is a problem that is consistent with many of these movies in that they often just seem like filmed plays.  That is, everything seems very staged and there is little real action; the focus is on dialogue, which often takes the somewhat formal form you see in the theater.  That is not to say that these are bad movies; actually, they are almost all good:  Streetcar is a five star film, Baby Doll, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Sweet Bird of Youth merit four, Night three and Roman Spring two.  There are also a good number of extras in the set, including commentaries on Streetcar and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, a bunch of mini-documentaries and a bonus disc called Tennessee Williams' South.  This bonus disc is an early-1970s documentary featuring interviews with Williams and various actors doing scenes from his plays; it is mildly interesting.

One does not watch Williams expecting happy endings and everything nicely resolved (although some of the films do end more upbeat than others, in part, I believe because of a Hollywood demand for such conclusions, despite how the plays may have been written).  Instead, you get a level and type of drama that was rarely shown prior to the Williams.  Overall, this set rates a high four stars; it may not be perfect, but you do get some good films that pushed the limits of what was allowed at the time.",1168128000,4,4747,4.6875753920386005
2513313,4,B000EBD9UI,"Each of the plays of Tennessee Williams that has been rended as a movie is worth watching.  The rawness of emotions, the actors and the direction all make these movies immensely watchable.",1168041600,2,188,4.875
2513314,5,B000EBD9UI,"If playwright Tennessee Williams's Southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of O'Neill or his closest contemporary Arthur Miller, they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters. This is clearly evidenced in this six-film, eight-disc collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of Hollywood in the 1950's and early 1960's, all directed by true filmmaking masters. Probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now, the best of the set are Elia Kazan's ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and John Huston's ""The Night of the Iguana"". The others are Kazan's ""Baby Doll"", Richard Brooks' ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", Jose Quintero's ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" and Brooks' ""Sweet Bird of Youth"".

A feral, smoldering Marlon Brando justifiably made his reputation as brutish Stanley Kowalski in 1951's ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and his animalistic charisma still leaps off the screen. Intriguingly, one of the extras included in the two-disc set for the movie is footage from a 1947 screen test of Brando when he was 23, and his stardom seems assured even then. The plot of the movie amounts to the inevitable clash between Kowalski and his visiting sister-in-law, Blanche DuBois, a fading Southern belle on the verge of a mental breakdown. Having proven her ability to be a convincing Southerner in ""Gone With the Wind"", Vivien Leigh expertly handles all the florid dialogue with her particular blend of defiance and vulnerability.

Strong supporting work comes from Kim Hunter as Blanche's naive sister Stella and Karl Malden as Blanche's seemingly respectful suitor Mitch. Now over ninety, Malden is on hand to provide his own eloquent recollections of the production on an alternate track, and film historians Rudy Behlmer and Jeff Young provide more objective commentary on another track. Film critic Richard Schickel's 1995 feature-length look at Kazan is the centerpiece of the second disk, and there is also a more interesting five-part documentary on the film and original Broadway show, the best portion focusing on censorship and the several minutes that have been reinserted in the DVD version of the film.

1964's ""The Night of the Iguana"" deals with a similarly dysfunctional group of people, but this time the setting is a dilapidated Mexican beach resort where Reverend Shannon, newly defrocked, has taken a group of spinsters from a women's college. Huston made his reputation on his strong literary adaptations, and his affinity shows in the fulsome characterizations, striking visuals and dark humor. Richard Burton is in peak form as Shannon, and there is also sterling work from Deborah Kerr as the spinsterish Hannah and especially Ava Gardner as the slatternly resort owner, Maxine Faulk. The DVD contains a recent making-of featurette and a vintage video, both fascinating.

""Baby Doll"" is an entertaining hoot that doesn't seem as sensationalistic as I'm sure it was when the film was first released in 1956. It's simply a Southern-fried farce about the potential deflowering of a nineteen-year old child bride with a nice, pouty turn by Carroll Baker in the title role and a surprisingly funny one by Karl Malden as her randy husband, cotton mill owner Archie. 1958's ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is far more vaunted but ultimately hamstrung by the overly careful portrayal of Brick as an asexual protagonist, this in spite of stellar performances from Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives.

Newman is even better as gigolo Chance Wayne in 1963's ""Sweet Bird of Youth"", and he is matched all the way by Geraldine Page's all-cylinders-on performance as faded movie queen Alexandra Del Lago (a role that would have ironically been ideal for Ava Gardner). The weakest film of the set is 1961's ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" about an aging American actress living in Rome who falls recklessly in love with an indifferent gigolo. A decade after ""Streetcar"", the glamorous-looking Leigh excels in the title role, while a young Warren Beatty fits the physical requirements as the gigolo Paolo even though his faux-Italian accent is a little too emphatic. All four of these movies come with making-of featurettes and original trailers, and ""Cat"" also includes commentary from Williams' biographer Donald Spoto.

The focal point of the eighth disc is a 1973 documentary, ""Tennessee Williams' South"", which highlights insightful interviews with Williams in the New Orleans area. The film also includes classic scenes from his plays reenacted specifically for the documentary. You can have the privilege of seeing Broadway's original Blanche DuBois, Jessica Tandy, and compare her work to Leigh's, as well as an impressive turn by Maureen Stapleton as Amanda Wingfield in ""The Glass Menagerie"". This is an incredible film collection for anyone who wants to see some of the greatest performances of mid-20th century American cinema.",1148342400,31,4996,5.1923076923076925

2513318,5,B000EBD9UI,"Warner Bros. has assembled a superb group of films derived from the plays, a novella, and an original screenplay by the immortal Tennessee Williams. Each film has been given a stellar presentation, with the finest of them all, his masterpiece, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, given the Warner 2-Disc special treatment. Filled with documentaries, commentaries, screen tests, and outtakes, this set is really an amazing assemblage of much of Williams' best work. At last we also have a remastered CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, which now looks stunning, following a rather faded and pasty DVD in the early days of the format.

Not content to rest on their laurels as others would, WB has unearthed a relatively unknown motion picture that will be a treasure to those who love this man's work.

A Canadian documentary feature from the mid '70s called ""TENNNESSEE WILLIAMS' SOUTH"" has been rescued from limbo, and how wonderful to have it included as an exclusive bonus in this collection. Not only does it contain rare interviews with Williams shot over the period of a year in both Key West and New Orleans, but it also contains scenes from his plays performed by some of our greatest actors, including Maureen Stapleton, Burl Ives, and most importantly, Jessica Tandy re-creating her performance as Blanche DuBois.

2513319,3,B000EBD9UI,"I never thought Tennessee Williams was translated very well to the screen.  His were classic plays meant to be seen within the intimacy of the theatre, where for a brief moment he held you in another time and place.  The only screen adaptation which I found fully satisfying was John Huston's The Night of the Iguana, which in its rich black and white, captured many of the emotions in the play.  Of course it helps having Richard Burton as the defrocked priest and Deborah Kerr as Hannah Jelks, not to mention a lusty Ava Gardner as Maxine Faulk.  But, more importantly, Huston did away with the awful German family which intruded on the play.

By contrast, Richard Brooks made a mess out of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, reducing this great play to a hopelessly tangled set of emotions, doing away with the homosexual themes that were interlaced in the play, and missing just about every other aspect of the play.  Ditto, Sweet Bird of Youth.  One would do much better to see Summer and Smoke with Laurence Harvey and Geraldine Page.

A Streetcar Named Desire falls somewhere in between.  There are strong performances, especially Vivian Leigh as Blanche DuBois, and Kazan worked closely with Williams to create a strong vision of the play, but still it falls short of expectations.

But, what makes me wonder most about this collection is that it is little more than a sampling of Williams, missing are classic works like The Rose Tattoo, The Glass Menagerie and Suddenly, Last Summer, which would have made far more sense to include than Baby Doll or The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone.",1146268800,11,1579,4.688405797101449
