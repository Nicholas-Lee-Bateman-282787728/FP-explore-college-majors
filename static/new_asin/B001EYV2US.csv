8342324,5,B001EYV2US,"As an ""in my head"" type, I love the way these moves bring me into my Self. It is so easy, almost anyone can do it on the first try. The poetic description of the Sacred Feminine (that's us) uplifted and expanded my identity as a woman in a remarkable and totally new way. It is beautiful!

After my first time with this DVD, I did my best writing ever. After a year of struggle, I finally found my voice -- clear, purposeful, incisive, unapologetic, playful. Every woman deserves this liberating experience!

I purchased this DVD thinking that it would help me to bring some new things to my classes.  Instead this DVD was ""cultish"" and homemade looking.  Not for me or for my students!",1225756800,,300,4.418181818181818
