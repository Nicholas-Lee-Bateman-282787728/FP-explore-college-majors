5450732,5,B00AMDA2OY,Bought these for my Dad for Father's Day because he loves old westerns.  He was excited to see some with actors that you normally don't find or see anymore.  He was truly pleased.  I got it right!  Score!,1371686400,,204,4.2894736842105265
5450733,5,B00AMDA2OY,"This is a very exceptional selection of westerns from yesteryear including a fine choice of actors Scott, McCrea, Wayne, Murphy etc....This selection really highlights many of the themes and archetypal characters from the 1940s and 50s!",1370390400,,236,5.583333333333333
5450734,5,B00AMDA2OY,"I was pleased to find two of Audie Murphy's earliest westerns Sierra and Kansas Raiders on this selection but there are some other gems here. The fact that there are three or four movies on each disc has not affected the picture quality which is excellent.
A rare treat for western fans.",1369353600,27,287,4.538461538461538
5450735,5,B00AMDA2OY,"Take my advice if you enjoy westerns of the 40's and 50's (B westerns included) and buy this dvd collection from Universal.  I make this recommendation based on:

1)  You get ten westerns, many shot on location, with Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico representing the American West.  The location shooting provides splendid scenery for the stories these films tell.

2)  You get a mix of B program westerns and some ""top of the bill"" films like ""The Spoilers"", ""Whispering Smith"", and ""The Virginian"".  In my opinion, all the movies are entertaining, relatively fast paced (none of the films are over 90 minutes long), and fun!

3)  Most important to me, Universal's Home Entertainment division has used excellent source material. These dvds are superior to other bargain films in their visual and audio presentations. No pops and hisses on the sound tracks and no washed out black and white or faded color presentations.  In my opinion (again), the films have got to look and sound as good (if not better) than they did in theatrical runs (and that was 70 years ago for some of these films).  I was mesmerized by even the least of these movies (for me, ""When the Daltons Rode""/""Texas Rangers Ride Again) by the quality of the images and and sound.  The dvd gives these westerns an immediacy that was startling. (I viewed these films on a Samsung 2010, 46"" television and an Opp 83 Blu Ray/DVD Player)

4)  Finally, these 10 very entertaining, top flight presentations cost 10 DOLLARS!!!  One buck a movie. One film has been released on the previous Western Classics, Vol. 2 Universal 4 film dvd (Kansas Raiders) and ""Whispering Smith"" and ""Albuqerque"" were released as stand alone dvds back about 10 years ago.  I had purchased those dvds.  I still feel I got one of the best dvd deals ever and I began buying the little discs in 1998!

Thanks for reading",1367712000,101,1852,4.734375
5450736,5,B00AMDA2OY,Got this collection because it had Sierra in it and I knew  Burl Ives sang a lot of songs in this movie.  Some of the others on this DVD we had never seen so it was a very enjoyable purchase.,1367280000,3,191,3.75
5450737,5,B00AMDA2OY,"Great collections of 10 westerns...some of which I had been searching for on DVD for some time.
Excellent transfer and whole set is great...hard to pick a favorite.
Really glad to have a copy of Comanche Territory and Tomahawk, as both brought back memories of seeing them as a teenager.",1367020800,,287,4.76
5450738,5,B00AMDA2OY,most of the films on this collection are already on dvd but quality of these films is really great and at 1 a film unsurpassed,1364342400,5,126,4.08
5450739,5,B00AMDA2OY,"I am a fairly young guy well at least young enough that all of these movies were released long before I was even born. However, that doesn't prevent me from enjoying them at all. Sci-fi used to be my favorite genre of movies even though I did like and have always enjoyed westerns, but now I would say westerns and classic movies are now my favorite. I collect westerns from all different era's but I have to say the classic westerns like the ones in the 10 pack are by far my favorite. Yes, they are dated compared to today's standards, but somehow I find them more enjoyable. I think the main reasons being is the actors, stories and the character's is what drives the movie instead of the realism and special effects being the focus. The point being is with these western classics you grow to become attached to your favorite actors such as Randolph Scott, John Wayne, Audie Murphy and Joel McCrea which are some of my favorites and this collection has several of my favorites. The quality is great and you just can't beat the price. Bob",1363737600,68,1040,4.478947368421053
5450740,5,B00AMDA2OY,"Universal did an awesome job on these movies and putting them in a wonderful collection. There isn't any special features and there is only English audio and no other language and subtitles. There are three disks with four on the first and three each on the last two disks. All movies are in Full frame format. Four of these films were also released as DVD-R and now you can get them as straight DVD with no MOD. All movies quality are great and I did compare to the other releases and I can't see any difference. ""Sierra"" and ""The Virginian"" were part of a TCM Vault box sets.

UPDATE-03/16/15 Universal has just released a 8-Movie Western Collection exclusively for Walmart and contains three Universal Vault movies and I would recommend that two, this way Universal can see their Western sales go up and hopefully make more.

Here are the movies included:

The Virginian (1948/color/90mins)

Albuquerque (1948/color/90mins)
-Randolph Scott, Barbara Britton, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, Lon Chaney Jr., George Cleveland; Directed by Ray Enright
Whispering Smith (1949/color/88mins)
Alan Ladd, Robert Preston, Brenda Marshall, Donald Crisp, Fay Holden, Frank Faylen; Directed by Leslie Fenton
Comanche Territory (1950/color/76mins)

-Van Heflin, Yvonne DeCarlo, Alex Nicol; Directed by George Sherman

Overall this is an excellent of Westerns to add to your collection and if you have any of these already this is a great item to free up some DVD space. I would and I have recommended this. Universal did a great job that I wish they would do another one.",1363132800,198,2454,5.55614973262032

5450763,5,B00AMDA2OY,"It's just amazing to me that you can have 10 digitally restored ""classic"" movies at this price.  I put quote marks around classic because these are not on the level of say High Noon or The Searchers but lesser known movies, certainly could be considered ""period pieces"" if you like but holding up pretty well in my humble opinion.  It also helps that all have been given ""the treatment"" by Deluxe Digital Studios and have benefited tremendously from the experience.  The packaging is very nice indeed with a clear plastic box of noticeably higher quality than others and also containing informative 2-sided artwork.  At well below $1 per this is a no-brainer!

At this price it may churlish to complain at all but I wish the Universal product planning folk would take better care in coordinating their offerings, there are at least 3 movies in this set that also appear in other Universal sets.  Still, a net of 7 new movies for $7 is pretty amazing.",1498435200,,950,4.692771084337349

5450814,4,B00AMDA2OY,"I do not know where else to place this review, so I am placing it here. Like the others, it is an old film, but not as good. It is When the Redmnan Rode with Jon Hall. Generally, while the old films have mistakes that are not overlooked in modern films, they are still fun to watch, just as the classic westerns are fun to watch. In fact, the mistakes add to the fun.
This one is a typical 1951 film. It is easy to see when a man who supposedly hits another actually misses him, and in the background one of the extras is having a problem getting on a horse, and when a fort wall that is supposedly a protection is shaking. Another problem is that frequently the acting is not very good. Still another problem is the stereotypes of blacks and Indians. In this film virtually all of the Indians are clearly ""whites,"" and they are frequently shown dancing by a fire.
In this film it is 1753, after frequent battles where the Indians are trying to protect their homes, there is peace, but the French want to take over land that the English took from the Indians. Colonel George Washington is leading the English forces and he gets help from an Indian who spent time learning about the English, the actor Jon Hall. Washington wants to persuade Halls father, who is the chief of the Delaware tribe, to join the English in the fight. Hall is being seduced by a French woman and needs to decide if he wants to marry her or an Indian woman who he promised to marry years ago. His love life is effecting the war.",1450310400,,1503,4.295774647887324

5450830,5,B00AMDA2OY,"Wow, what a deal.  This collection is well worth the price.  Most times, on as 10 movie collection, my expectations are for maybe 1 or 2 good features and 8 or 9 grainy movies with poorly synchronized audio tracks or just plain bad dubbing.  Not here!  These are all good movies from the 50's with some of the best cowboys of the day.  John Wayne, Randolph Scott, Audie Murphy and Joel McCrea to give you the top of the list.  These are all well written, beautifully shot movies.  They may not be Dances with Wolves, but they are great little morality plays with easily identifiable good guys and bad guys.  You can spend as much for an individual movie in this set, but here you get 9 more.  Great value, excellent quality make for a superior deal.",1436832000,4,749,4.408759124087592

I was very surprised to find out that I had not seen many of these movies, and that they were good quality movies.  Whoever the person is that combined this set of movies has excellent taste.  I am very pleased to have this collection.",1435190400,,301,4.155172413793103

5450836,4,B00AMDA2OY,"First of all the picture quality for all 10 is very good to excellent.
 The three oldest are in black and white and are the first 3 on disc 1
 'When the Daltons Rode' ( 1940) has plenty of action, maybe to much. 3.5
  'Texas Rangers Ride Again' (1940) surprisingly good. 4 .
  'The Spoilers' (1942) stars Scott and young Wayne and do they ever have the biggest bar fist fight I think ever filmed. For that alone 5 stars.
  ' The Virginian' (!946) in color. Starring Joel MacCrea in one of the greatest westerns ever filmed. 5 stars.

  Disc 2  westerns are all in color.
  'Albuquerque' (1948) one Scotts best westerns. 5 stars
  'W hispering Smith' (1949)  Alan Ladd- pre Shane and very good. 5 stars.
  'Comanche Territory' (1950) MacDonald Carey. With a great Will Geer who steals every scene he is in. 4.5 stars

  Disc 3 is the worst sad to say.
  Sierra ( 1950) with Audi Murphy. What can I say Burl Ives sings folk songs and.... 2.5
  Kansas Raiders' (1950) Murphy plays young Jesse James with conscience. Duh? But lots of action. 3.5 stars
  'Tomahawk' (1951) with Van Heflin. pretty good surprise and early sensitivity toward plight of Indian. 4.5 stars.
  So, overall a dam good set of westerns in very decent picture quality. I enjoyed 8 out of 10. And at asking price a steal. Highly recommended.",1434844800,8,1308,4.512931034482759

5450838,4,B00AMDA2OY,"I love western movies because they had dialogue and characters you just don't find in movies today. They're fun. And in almost every movie, you'll find an eccentric character or two you will enjoy. No blood and guts though, so don't watch them expecting to find the thrill a minute movies they try to give us today. I much prefer being lulled into a story rather than shocked with a bloody scene or naked body.",1434153600,,410,4.48

5450864,3,B00AMDA2OY,"This is a mixed bag of movies, Some, such as The Virginian, are pretty good. Some not so much. However, it is all up to your taste which differs, of course, with individuals. My wife and I agree that 3 stars is a fair rating.

The disc with the Kansas Raiders is flawed. During the playback it would stop and skip to the point where the movie was unwatchable.

None of the movies are close captioned. That was an oversight on my part when I ordered the movie. Had I researched it as I should have I would not have made the purchase.",1426032000,3,532,4.155339805825243

In my home we enjoy something we call a ""Sunday Matinee"" -- films like we used to see as kids at a local theater on, yes, a Sunday afternoon. Films just like these. Not art, but entertaining. Not demanding, but highly enjoyable.

5450944,5,B00AMDA2OY,"This is overall very good technical quality for the price point.  The fact that it's a 2014 release from a major studio gave me hope, since the bottom-of-the-barrel labels like Echo Bridge squeeze up to five movies per disc and compress the files way too much.

Disc 1:  four movies on the disc, the first three are B&W
Discs 2 and 3 each have three movies, all in color.

The video bit rates fall in the 3-4 Mbps range, and the visible compression is fairly light.  Audio on all titles is 2.0 @ 192 kbps.",1405555200,2,505,4.273684210526316

5450949,5,B00AMDA2OY,"All these westerns are good, some quite good, but one is a little gem--a genuine masterpiece--and that's Comanche Station.  It was to be Randolph Scott's swan song, but he came out of retirement to do one more with Joel McCrea, Ride the High Country, which is also a great western.

Comanche Station is about being true to yourself and about staying true to the purity of a quest. Scott, although in his early sixties, seems to have become only more taut and leathery in appearance.  In behavior he's more forgiving--he smiles a lot because he's living on a pure plane. He delivers his lines with such laconic perfection, concise yet full of effect and meaning, without affectation or self-pity.

The subtext is the relationship that develops between a man and a woman.  It isn't sexual, although you feel it might have been under other circumstances.  It's more rare, even unique; it's about the emerging respect between a man and woman.  SPOILER: When Scott rides off at the end (without waiting for his reward), you feel genuine satisfaction in his having done the right thing, and in his continuing commitment to a search which in itself suffices fully. It's a beautiful little movie. Subtle and feeling in many ways.",1404691200,,1221,4.841346153846154
