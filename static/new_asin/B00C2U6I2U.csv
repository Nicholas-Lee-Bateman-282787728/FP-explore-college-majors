Wonderful cast, Slim Summerville  as Fortune may be my favorite character, but all stars and supporting actors memorable. Follows the novel closely, except for the very ending which I, frankly, prefer.",1526256000,,266,5.487804878048781

8576792,4,B00C2U6I2U,"Not your typical Fonda movie but great to see this talented  actor in his early years. Great  supporting cast too including Janet Gaynor, Andy Devine, Charles Bickford and Margaret Hamilton;",1465862400,,190,5.3
8576793,4,B00C2U6I2U,"Janet Gaynor was a big star in 1935 at Fox Films.  Winfield Sheehan ran the studio and, while many of the studio products were dated and poor box-office, the Gaynor films were the exception.  ""The Farmer Takes a Wife"" is a superbly produced (by Sheehan) and directed (by Victor Fleming) story of life on the Erie Canal in the 1820s.  The films has so many attractions: Henry Fonda making his debut in the part he played on the stage and establishing a screen persona which followed him for the next 50 years; beautiful outdoor sets with re-creations of the times such that the film is a slice of authentic history; Gaynor in the lead as a feisty canal girl, beautifully in character and utterly convincing; a great supporting cast including Charles Bickford as the villain, Margaret Hamilton as a friend of Gaynor and very funny and most of all, Slim Summerville as a dentist. The photography is superb.

The film has been issued in the Fox Cinema Archives series which means it is bare-bones with no extras, not even a scene selection but the print is good, in spite of some splicing jumps.  This is a wonderful film to have become available and another testimony to the skill of Janet Gaynor, the first actress to win an Academy Award in 1928.",1451779200,,1245,4.615384615384615
8576794,5,B00C2U6I2U,"Living in upstate New York and having an interest in local history we have been fascinated by the history of the Erie Canal. This film depicts the canal quite accurately, though it was actually filmed on a different canal. The story line was sufficiently interesting to make the film worth seeing even if you don't much care about the canal itself, but you should. It played a huge role in the creation of this great nation. Without the Erie Canal our westward expansion would have been much more difficult and slower.

The quality is quite good considering the age of the film and it's interesting to see Henry Fonda in his first film role.",1426896000,3,641,4.62280701754386
8576795,5,B00C2U6I2U,"Excellent movie, Henry Fonda give an excellent performance in ""The Farmer Takes a Wife"". Its the kind of movie you can watch again and again...  Great family entertainment!",1395100800,,172,5.142857142857143
8576796,5,B00C2U6I2U,"For those who are students of canal history, you will love every minute of this old, classic movie.
Well directed, acted, and filmed.  Henry Fonda's first film.  Lots of familiar faces.  The film portrays the Erie Canal, but was filmed on the Lehigh Canal near Freemansburg.  Chronicles the the era when the railroad began to replace the canal as the major mode of transportation in the east.",1389398400,2,392,4.8059701492537314
8576797,3,B00C2U6I2U,"The production and  performances are fine and so is the writing but...I don't want to be living on The Erie Canal in 1840. Or, any other time. The Fox DVD transfer is okay, so if you think you like the setting, go for it. Otherwise spend your money elsewhere.",1389225600,,259,4.285714285714286
8576798,4,B00C2U6I2U,When I first saw who was starring in this film I was interested.  It was a good film and definitely a star studded film.,1371081600,,120,4.0
8576799,4,B00C2U6I2U,"This film is interesting for several reasons. If you are a history buff, you'll enjoy the picture of life on the Erie Canal as the canal-boat people came to the realization that the railroad was there to stay and meant the death of canal traffic. More important to old movie fans, this was Henry Fonda's first movie role, and he is aw-shucks wonderful.  Janet Gaynor's portrayal of her feisty character shows that good acting holds up over the decades. Finally, the character actors, including Charles Bickford, Margaret Hamilton and Andy Devine. Jane Withers, child actor, plays a small part. The plot is a bit hokey, and people tend to break into song for barely discernible reasons. And of course the trips down the canal look hokey to us today, with the projected backgrounds.  But the acting, plus the delicious good looks of Henry Fonda make up for those dated qualities.",1368057600,7,877,4.84
