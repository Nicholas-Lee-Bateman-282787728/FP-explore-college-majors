4323570,5,B004C1W1VY,"One of my top all time favorites! Just returned from my first trip to India and picked this film up at the airport...a part from being incredibly humorous in a clever way...the values this film reflects are universal.  The theme is how four students of one of India's super competitive Indian Institutes of Engineering  makes their way through university and post graduation life...While one student memorizes and shoe shines his way through; another challenges all the norms (talk about funny university pranks!), breaks the rules and truly shows us what it is to be a free thinking leader...The dialogue and acting brought howls of laughter from my whole family (daughters 10 and 12 years and husband, included). While our family is not Indian, we all felt this bollywood film trumped hollywood in message, humor and intelligence.",1292284800,6,832,5.110294117647059
4323571,5,B004C1W1VY,"I saw this movie on a SAS Flight to Copenhagen.  I had never seen a Bollywood movie before and I was so impressed with this particular movie that I watched it a second time on the flight and now I'm ordering the DVD from Amazon.  I am considering buying and downloading at least some of the mp3s from the soundtrack via Amazon as well.

The movie is in Hindi. I speak no Hindi, but it has English subtitles.  The movie was lighthearted entertainment.  I found it very funny, with a good soundtrack, it had a thought provoking theme, and an engaging plot.  It probably won't be widely acknowledged outside of the greater Hindi speaking world, but it is definitely worth the effort to find it and deal with the subtitles.  I've recommended it to several of my colleagues who I know either speak Hindi or are interested in foreign films.

I don't collect DVDs so I rarely purchase movies.  Only those that have a significant impact on me in terms of being entertaining enough for multiple viewing and sharing with friend and family motivate a purchase.  I think this movie is worth it and am adding it to my ""collection"" of approximately 5 or 6.

If you don't purchase it at least make the effort to rent it!  You won't be disappointed.

4323572,5,B004C1W1VY,"This is the movie that everyone should watch. It is not just any other comedy or chick-flick movie. The movie is full of humor but on the same hand it teaches us lesson about a life that has very deep meaning to it and I believe all teachers and education system should watch this movie. The movie sends a message of being creative in life and not just being only followers. It's a story about friendship, love, flawed education system that creates unhealthy competition , and the most important having the courage to be different and think different in life.
Amir khan as always has been the anchor of this movie. His role cultivates the thinking of a normal college student who is caught up in vicious cycle of our education system where primary goal is all about getting grades and secondary goal is understanding it.
I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie.",1289779200,6,874,4.608974358974359
4323573,5,B004C1W1VY,"When visiting my son, I saw this fat yellow box with the words, "" 3 Idiots"".  I thought it was another stupid teen flick, but I was wrong.  My son pulled it out later and wanted me to watch it.  Even with some subtitles, I laughed, cried and rejoiced with this film.  Besides being entertaining, it had a great message and lesson. That is why this movie is on my top ten list.",1286496000,4,376,4.109589041095891
4323574,5,B004C1W1VY,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Aamir Khan is a very talented actor and the supporting cast were excellent.  The story is about one man's view of the world as opposed to those around him.  I laughed, cried and rejoiced at the antics of the four main characters and of course Kareena Kapoor the love interest is very easy to watch.  The first time I watched the movie I had no English subtitles but managed to follow the film and could not wait for my DVD to arrive.  A unique way of marketing and very well worth the extra money!  The subtitles filled in the blanks and I enjoyed the sense of humour especially the ""speech"" that had been altered. I am an Australian over 70 and I am hooked on Hindi moves.

4323607,5,B004C1W1VY,"Great movie (if you don't mind reading subtitles)! It's so refreshing to see foreign movies because their stories are so different and not told in the way that you may see here. Don't want to give anything away so you will have to see it for yourself. We originally bought it for my mother in law (who wanted to share the story with us after seeing it with her friend) but after seeing it, we bought one for ourselves!",1494115200,2,418,4.30379746835443

4323610,5,B004C1W1VY,This movie has made it to my top favorite movies. It is subtitled so beware.

I wanted to share this movie with people who don't know English, but only Spanish... impossible!!!

4323676,5,B004C1W1VY,The U.S. Presidential Election's right ahead of us. The politicians always compete over the numbers about who creates more jobs and lowers the unemployed rate while they talk about our dreams. Since when our dreams were to get a job and make money. Has money really become our dream? Then we don't have dream. We've lost it. These three idiots show us how stupid our world has become and make us think about who we really are and what we really want in our life in a very funny way.,1473465600,,482,4.366666666666666

4323716,5,B004C1W1VY,"I was recommended this film by a coworker and boy was I glad I watched it. Absolutely wonderful comedy\drama\look at life in India\and social commentary. Really excellent acting, wonderful script, and likeable characters. While it is almost 3 hours long - I was glued to the TV the whole time. The fact that it was in Hindi with English subtitles was no problem and story was very easy to follow.
The ending was both heart-warming and inspirational. In my view - the best film I've seen this year (since 2015's Big Short).
I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone. Even kids (particularly at teenage years or formative school years) might enjoy it as it shows the value of following your passions and pursuing your happiness, and also makes fun of silly ""academia"" focused on tests over knowledge or inspiration.
Anyway, to sum it up - I loved it.",1460851200,3,848,4.736486486486487

A not so gentle examination of how our children are guided through some critical and formative stages of becoming adults. A hard look at how best intentions go wrong sometimes and what can be done to make life better for our children as they become adults. This is a pretty common theme in Hindi film but what distinguishes this movie is presentation. It is filled with both creative and familiar sight gags and humor, truly like able and despicable characters who are played so convincingly that you find yourself completely involved as the movie progresses. Flipping back and forth between the present and past are so artfully executed that you almost forget where you are at times. I laughed my ass off and cried. I rooted for the heroes and cursed the villains. It was a complete emotional experience for me. The biggest plus is that it is done intelligently and believably.

I usually fall asleep in movies (all the Harry Potters for example) and just don't have the patience to watch them. I recommend this as a Christmas gift for teens that you don't know what to get.  I wrapped this up with a bunch of candy and popcorn for my senior high school nephews who will soon be going to college themselves so thought it appropriately funny and timely. Even though not an expensive gift, it was one that I felt good giving and knew that it would be enjoyed and appreciated.

This movie is a comedy, a tragedy, a life lesson, and a travelogue, all wrapped into one. There are really silly parts, so if you're looking for high art, don't look to this movie. It's also a musical, but even my husband, who loves only action movies, liked this movie and didn't mind the songs. I have actually overheard him recommending this movie to his friends! As for myself, after seeing the movie the first time, I came to Amazon and downloaded 3 songs from the movie! It stands up to re-watching, and so owning it is not an excess.

Note that the actors speak in, I believe, Hindi, peppered with a mix of English words. The movie is subtitled, but again, my husband, who doesn't like to read his movies, had no issue with this.",1453680000,2,867,4.385093167701863

4323794,5,B004C1W1VY,"Perhaps my favorite movie of all time, ""3 Idiots"" is a delight from beginning to end.  There is plenty of humor, as you would expect with guys in college (it's always a group of 3 guys in Bollywood movies) and there is a great deal of emotion and weeping, so get your hankies out.  Plus it has one of the most hilariously gratifying denouements in all of cinema.
I could watch this one every day, I think--it made me joyously loopy over my new favorite star Aamir Khan.  The songs and dances are original (throwing in plenty of soapsuds, mops, and a wonderful Hollywood movie parody as a love scene) but the other songs are hauntingly beautiful and poetic.

A friend of mine, who had never seen it, imagined it to be Bollywood's version of the Three Stooges, so I need to say from the start, IT IS NOT! This is not a slapstick movie about stupid people. The title characters are three friends at an engineering university in India. The principal character is an unconventional and nonconforming genius who, along with his two friends, is called an idiot by the narrow-minded head of the university. He (the main character) solves problems by original thinking. The end of the movie is surprising and very satisfying. I recommend it highly.

Blu-ray, same cover art as pictured here.  Made the mistake of not opening it and previewing it when it arrived.  I teach film in a university and only needed it a few weeks later.  When I played it at that time, I discovered there was a defect in the menu tree.  I could play the film, but WITHOUT subtitles.  I could go to the subtitle menu, but COULD NOT ALTER IT (to turn them on).  In fact, noting but ""play"" would work.  For example, I could not do ""scene selection.""  So I was in front of a class of 200, my introduction to the film was done and I had no choice but to play it without subtitles (or even dubbing - gag) IN HINDI.  Do you know how many San Diego State University students speak Hindi?!!

Now it's too late to return it.  I have no idea if my disk had a unique problem or if yours will do this same thing.  But I'm looking to sell this cheap to someone who would enjoy watching it in Hindi!",1435017600,,1065,3.952830188679245

I watched it the first time with my nine year old when he was home sick from school. We laughed (a lot) we cried, we danced, and then we watched 3 Idiots again two days later. We HAD to share it with my older son and my husband.
I love this film as much as I love The Sound of Music, Singin' in the Rain and Airplane.  We can watch it over and over.

The film is hilarious but also very poignant. Don't be put off by subtitles. If my nine year old can keep up, so can you!! There were a few ""questionable"" scenes. But they were brief and not nearly as objectionable (IMO) as the local news or much of what kids see today. Nothing hateful, just a very brief sexual conversation. See below for a bit of a spoiler

If this is Bollywood, I love Bollywood.

Spoiler: There is suicide in this film. It is not graphic, but it is heartwrencing. I found this a great time to discuss suicide with kids. Others could feel differently.",1421366400,11,1061,4.15609756097561

I became besotted of his talent when I saw ""Lagaan"" in a post-colonial literature class during graduate school.  I wrote a paper on that movie, and it's since become one of my top ten movies, if such a thing really exists.

Because I have nothing but respect for AK, I rented this movie because of the reviews, and I cannot believe it took me so long to get around to watching this.

Every minute was well spent.  This movie is fully deserving of the accolades and praise it receives.  There is so much here worth investing yourself in -- and it shows Bollywood as something beyond the stereotypes.

4324039,3,B004C1W1VY,"My 13-year-old son was desperate to see this movie, as his teacher had shown part of it in his school and he was keen to see the whole. I was a bit confused, since he's never had any interest in Indian cinema or Bollywood - his enthusiasm surprised me, to be honest. I got the movie, and we watched it as a family, and after that he re-watched scenes on his own, often laughing hysterically.

I didn't like the film as much as he did, although the film is certainly not without its charms. All of the characters are full and engaging, and some of the scenes are pretty funny. But as a non-Hindi speaker, I was a bit confused at the way the characters would lurch back and forth between English and Hindi, and the dialogue was so swift-moving that I struggled to keep up with the subtitles; at nearly three hours, it was also simply too long (exhausting, really). The comedy is interspersed with many deeply serious moments that had been wrung of emotions so far beyond the furthest conceivable extent by using every trick in the book that they felt completely dishonest - I actually had to wonder if I was really watching a clever comedy, as 3 Idiots has been billed, or if it was really just a purplish melodrama. Even the title is inaccurate - the three fellows are hardly idiots, having been admitted to India's most prestigious school; they are in fact the cream of the crop, and at least one of them is a genius. Oh well!

But the twists at the ending were quite a surprise, even to a jaded movie goer like myself, and there's definitely a lot worth taking in. The closing scenes in Ladakh, which delayed release of the film by one year (an attempt to film one year was snowed out, so they had to return at a later date to get their shots) are stunningly beautiful and probably worth the price of admission alone. It's also good to watch a film that captivated the imagination of Indians so thoroughly - from 2009 to 2013 it was India's highest-grossing film before being overtaken.

The DVD comes with plenty of bonus materials, but nothing terribly interesting. The best one is a featurette called ""Idiots in Ladakh"" (10:00) about their misadventures trying to film there. There is also a featurette on the song ""Aal Iss Well"" (all is well) at 3:00, ""100% Idiots"" (4:30) that talks about how they filmed a particular street scene, and ""Miss Idiot"" (3:20) , about how they came up with the look of the female love interest.

I even kind of feel I am like Raj, the character. I love studying but I once keep worrying that what if I fail. As Rancho said, how could you live today well if you are so scared of tomorrow! Purse excellence and success will chase you.

The beginning is funny: students playing pranks on the schoolmaster, and on other students (the joke about urinating on a live wire, though, is not new; you can find it in Salman Rushdie's ""Midnight's Children"").  The movie is also full of clichs:  the paralyzed father who has a heart attack and has to be taken to the hospital in a rush; the complaining mother; the emergency delivery of a baby who may or may not be alive; the ""bad"" schoolmaster who repents in the end; the superstitious/overly-religious student who finally grows up to be a man of principle....

This movie has everything family entertainment should be, and much more...yes...I mean much more.
So, what's it all about? It's about everything...friendship, perseverence, forgiveness, vengeance, hatred, pride, greed, love, beauty, motivation, education, poverty, and the list goes on and on... Rancho, our hero, berges into the lives of two very disimilar young men, who are both headed in the wrong direction. He not only touches these two profoundly...in fact, so profoundly that they come looking for him years later, but he also affects the lives of everyone around him, even the strict Professor 'Virus.' Rancho is the best friend anyone could wish for, and he shows us in this movie that there is some good in even the worst of us. Absolutely loved this film.

After sitting down for the nearly 3 hours it took to watch this I walked away almost paralyzed.... IN PURE AWESOMENESS!!!!  This movie made me laugh and cry and giggle and kept me riveted. This is now my absolute favorite movie of all time. I made my dad watch it as well. And my sister. And they loved it as well. I have no problem with subtitles so this was the perfect movie for me. I loved Amir Khan in this and the other main characters... Especially Raju! I feel the intense need to marry someone like one of them... Or maybe just grab Raju and run! HAhahaha.

I won't say a word about its fine actors, who combine zany staginess with convincing naturalness. I won't comment on the wildly funny melange of Hindi and English spoken by all characters, all subtitled perfectly. I won't mention the potent sociological portrayal of the self-consciously modern India that sends its brightest to California, including the immigrant friend who recommended ""3 Idiots"" to me, whose personalized license plate is OLIZWEL.

4324194,4,B004C1W1VY,"Reportedly the highest grossing Bollywood movie in India, a touching and exhilarating comedy-drama ""3 Idiots"" follows the life of three students at a fictional elite college ""Imperial College of Engineering"" - ""Rancho"" (Aamir Khan, ""Lagaan"") and his friends, Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi).

Nothing can stop Rancho from being what he is - free-spirited and quick-witted student who is ready to help his friends in trouble. Aamir Khan, then 44-year-old, is impressive as Rancho. this brilliant and outspoken man who suddenly disappeared.

The character-driven narrative of ""3 Idiots"" may reflect the recent trend in Indian films; that is, less musical/dancing sequences. (If I am not mistaken, the film has only two dancing sections). It is also notable that despite its occasional raw humor, the film is obviously meant to be more of a satire than a comedy. The film is often laugh-out-loud funny while addressing such immediate topics as the educational system.

The film's serious social message is sometimes overshadowed by the melodramatic situations in which these flawed but likable characters are in. Kareena Kapoor plays Pia, a daughter of the strict president of the college, but the romantic subplot tends to be weaker than the main one about the ""3 Idiots.""

Flawed as it is, ""3 Idiots"" is a hugely entertaining film, with three unforgettable characters.",1375574400,,1381,5.292237442922374

The movie is fun and funny at times - with a really nice story and lesson about life. There are a few ""breakout dancing and singing in colorful dress"" interludes (which is the Bollywood experience to my understanding) - these scenes were nice interludes in a well-done movie. Although it is almost 3 hours long, the time went by quickly and I was not bored at any point.

I set it aside. After a day or so, I fast-forwarded through some of it to see if it might be worthwhile. Some of it looked funny, seemed like good acting, some good singing. So, I decided to give it a try. Three straight hours of subtitles still would have been too much for me, so I spread it over three or four evenings.

It did turn out to be funny, good acting, some brief but beautiful travel portions, and uplifting. I've found myself saying ""all is well"" sometimes and it reminds me that watching the movie was a good choice.",1371254400,,747,4.216783216783217

What a great feature Amazon has for many of the books they offer...one can actually look inside where you can check out the table of contents and  look further to see actual pages.

Starting off in modern day, a pair of friends reunited before taking off on a trek to find their close friend Rancho, the fellow student they knew back in engineering school who changed both their lives forever ... and disappeared almost immediately after graduating.  Thinking they have a line on him, they instead come across another of their fellow students from back in the day - this time not a friend, but a guy who wants to get back at Rancho and the boys for the way he was treated back in their school days.  Via flashbacks (the bulk of the film) showing how the friends met and became close, to their days at the engineering school and the supreme pressure they and their peers were put under, to typical college-style pranks and the first times of falling in love, this film has everything; you'll laugh out loud, shed more than a few tears ... but more than anything else, in the end really feel like you were on a journey, and really got to know and care for these characters as though they were friends of your own.

However, I we let our 7 yr old , 12 year old and 14 year old watch this movie - because the dramatic social elements of life that were touched on in the film resonate among even the preteens in our own society. (Sad, but true.) This movie came with a PG-13 rating for thematic elements, I believe.  It was a real 'cryer'...so we really appreciated the lighthearted and goofy moments.

An engaging narrative meant to educate, melodious songs not interrupting the plot's logical unfolding, some breathtaking shots of the Pangong Tso Lake in the Ladakh region, and the endearing characters of Chatur, Rancho, Raju, Farhan, and Prof. Viru help us to understand why this movie is one of the most successful in Bollywood history.

When it comes to running-time, why does Bollywood treat every movie as if it were a sweeping historical epic on the order of a ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or a ""Doctor Zhivago?""  A case in point:  ""3 Idiots,"" an amiable enough little screwball comedy that has been padded out to a wrist-slashing 164 minutes.  It also happens to be the most commercially successful Bollywood feature ever released in India.  Go figure.

The story centers around a trio of promising but mischievous young engineering students who rebel against the high-pressured rigidity - both academic and personal - of the exclusive school they're attending.

""3 Idiots"" has two things going for it: its cranked-up energy level and its appealing actors, especially Aamir Khan, who portrays the ringleader of the group.  These alone are enough to compensate for the silliness of much of the action, the corniness of the jokes (with irritating cue music in case we couldn`t pick up on the corn on our own) and the stickiness of the sentimentality.  And, in its own playful way, the movie makes some important points about the intense pressure placed on Indian children to achieve beyond their parents' wildest expectations, and about the need to pursue the path that will make one most happy in life.

It's a pretty entertaining feature, overall; I just wish it didn't take so darn long to play itself out.",1342224000,5,1374,4.909090909090909

The DVD content, however, gets a 2/5 stars. There was no commentary, very few behind the scenes, and the subtitles are the only positive thing I have to mention.

My biggest problem with the film, however, is that it's way too long. The movie should have been re-edited for American audiences and at least 45 minutes of useless dialogue should have been removed. The main point of the story is very interesting, but as I like my movies to be more about quality than quantity, I had to skip many of the scenes just to get to the main point of the story. Again, Bollywood, if you want international audiences, especially Americans, to find interest in and view your film, please do us all a favor and edit them for time. Indian and other audiences may not care -and may actually like the longer running times- but tastes being different, we Americans do want our movies short and sweet.",1318377600,,844,4.451612903225806

Farhan studied engineering to please his father, instead of pursuing his wish to become a wildlife photographer. Raju studied engineering to help his family's finances.

The story is further complicated by Rancho becoming romantically involved with the dean's daughter. They find 'Rancho,' and also learn that he had been an impostor stand-in student for a rich man's son, doing it both for the money and the love of learning. The 'real' Rancho turns out to be a teacher, and a famous scientist using a different name. The dean's daughter and the 'real' Rancho then rekindle their relationship.

Hindi films are often praised for their dances, colors, and other cultural aspects, but they are seldom applauded for actually making the audience think. This movie raises issues about the shortcomings of traditional education in countries like India, while still being an entertaining feature film.

Initially we were concerned that it was in Hindi with subtitles and that it might be a problem - but it really isn't. After seeing it, you tend to remember the best lines as if they were all in English, even the ones that were actually in Hindi.

My daughter, who is very partial to comedies, loved this too, and still quotes lines from it.

The theme is universal (across many cultures) and some of the music is quite catchy despite being in Hindii (Non-Hindii speaking viewers will appreciate the subs).  The present/past flip-flop may confuse some people but works well.  I thought Pia's character played somewhat secondary to the others and towards the end was almost predictable and stereotyped.  The story line is simple.  Almost too simple as it leaves many questions unanswered.  For example, how did Rancho become so successful?

The speech by Omi Vaidya is hilarious even in translation.  (Do read the Wikipedia on this.  He is an American actor who was purposely told not to study Hindi, to make his dialogue more realistically stilted.)  After you have seen this movie, ask yourself: why can't Hollywood do this anymore?  This movie is rated PG, and not suited for young children due to some emotionally troubling scenes.

Despite the setting and subject matter it actually translates well universally because it's basically a movie showing the impact of the Americanization of Indians right down to the suicide; which is a huge taboo in Hindu culture and a huge part of this movie (kind of ham-fisted but not overwhelming).  They even throw in a bit of class-ism and sex-ism for good measure.  Altogether this makes for an accurate portrayal of society in India and even Indians in America.

The movie feels like 2 or 3 movies in 1 because of length (around 3 hours).  Fortunately, it doesn't drag at all.  Definitely worth a rental.

4324360,5,B004C1W1VY,"Honestly, how keen would you be to watch a movie if it were titled 3 IDIOTS? So, yeah, it's the movie title that put me off from watching this for some time, having been singed by Akshay Kumar's recent brace of brain-dead comedies; I believed 3 IDIOTS would only be more of the same. I guess I hadn't counted on Aamir Khan's having more artistic integrity than Akshay Kumar.

But there's a reason 3 IDIOTS is today the most resounding box office blockbuster in Indian cinema. Credit the polished production values and the ingratiating story and the memorable acting performances. But credit, too, the discriminating viewing audience that, by elevating this picture, decries (even if passively) the draconian values implemented into its nation's higher learning institutions. Plenty of movie goers seem to side with Rancho's poor regard of India's callous educational system. Or maybe I'm reading too much into it. Maybe they're packing the theaters because that's what happens when a movie is good enough, entertaining enough. The point is there's now another vehicle for this sort of scathing message, 3 IDIOTS side by side with LIKE STARS ON EARTH in raising your consciousness and mine. And that's pretty cool. And, by the way, who stars in LIKE STARS ON EARTH? Not Akshay Kumar.

At near three hours' running time, 3 IDIOTS has room to establish its various story threads. The song lyrics go: ""Where did he go... let's find him."" The opening sequence informs us of a five year search conducted by two former college roommates - Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi - for their long-missing friend Rancchoddas Samaldas Chanchad, and their quest is near to ending. 3 IDIOTS is comprised predominantly of flashbacks as we meet these three people ten years ago, these three roommates in their first year at the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering.

Farhan and Raju are uptight students, both shouldering the harsh burden of their families' expectations. Certain parents will do that, certain cultures depend on that. Farhan would rather be a wildlife photographer. Raju is wilting under the duress of extreme poverty and a paralyzed father. More pressure is piled on by the unforgiving professor Viru who views those who don't place first in class (and, by definition, in everything else) as ""losers"" and ""idiots."" And, at that point, the movie title made sense to me. Professor Viru believes that life is competition. In comes the extraordinary Rancchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad to teach him different.

It's apparent from jump that Rancchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad - or ""Rancho""- won't bow down to conventions. In college, wills are broken and spirits are shattered. But not Rancho's. Rancho is free-spirited and kind and tends to think outside the box. Rancho looks askance at the institution's emphasis on rote memorization, and then he makes fun of it. And, luckily for Farhan and Raju, Rancho becomes their roommate, because these two tense souls needed an injection of loosening up. But Rancho's offbeat worldview and frequent pranks make a devoted foe of Professor Viru and disconcert the other instructors. Color us not at all startled with this development. But Rancho's influence on his roommates continues to grow, making for a tumultuous four years at this engineering college.

In a country in which procuring a degree is the means to all the good things in life (job, social status, wife...), 3 IDIOTS offers a dissenting philosophical perspective. Except it's easier said than done, to follow your bliss, to gainsay your father's wishes, to not buckle against the pressures brought about by family and culture. There's a low-level resentment that Farhan and Raju direct at Rancho because Rancho comes from an affluent family, and so the pressure's juuust a bit less. But then comes the plot swerve.

There's a warmth and a spirit and a feel good direction to the film, and the laughs come hard and often. I think it's impossible to dislike. The cast engages you. Aamir Khan, for someone who's in his 40s, is believable as someone two decades younger; he exudes that sense of youth. R Madhavan and Sharman Joshi (respectively Farhan and Raju), even though pretty much relegated to sidekick roles, lend distinct touches to their characters, and I particularly relished Raju's later redeeming moments. Boman Irani as the main villain looks like a caricature and inches really close to playing it over-the-top, with his lisp and his power naps. But he exerts enough serious bile to pull off the antagonistic role. Kareena Kapoor steps away from glamour and settles for minimal make-up and a pair of glasses, and this grounds her character. She plays Pia, Professor Viru's daughter, who initially looks down on Rancho. But you and me, we know which way the wind is blowing. And to demonstrate yet again just how nonconformist Rancho is, when he and Pia lean in for a kiss, the camera doesn't timidly veer away. 3 IDIOTS, bucking tradition left and right. And, to spice up the present-day sequences, there's even a mystery involved, although you'd have to be three kinds of an idiot not to figure it out before long. If you're like me, and no one's bothered to tell you just how tremendous this movie is, then you've been missing out on something rather brilliant. To quote the incorrigible Rancho: ""Aal izz well, pal."" Except that I'm still a little cheesed at Akshay Kumar.

The DVD's bonus material (enough of it in English so that westerners can follow): ""Idiots in Ladakh"" - a featurette chronicling how hard it was to film in Ladakh during inclement climate (00:10:03 minutes long); Making the ""Aal Izz Well"" number (00:02:59 minutes); ""100% Idiots"" - a behind the scenes look at shooting the drunken scene and how the actors maybe, maybe not actually imbibed, thus prolonging the shooting and causing film to run out (00:04:30); and ""Making of Miss Idiot"" - the process in determining the right look for Kareena kapoor's film character (00:03:17).",1308441600,3,5962,5.016161616161616
4324361,4,B004C1W1VY,"Following the stupendous success of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" in 2008, interest in Indian cinema increased markedly. Yet that movie, while set in India, was directed by an Englishman. Most people in the U.S. know very little of real Indian film, but the number of Bollywood fans is growing rapidly, and they are almost evangelical in their admiration for Aamir Khan, the star of ""3 Idiots"" and a golden boy in his native country. Of the relatively few exports from that enormous market to play in American theaters, this 2009 film is one of the best. It makes a fine entree into the cinematic culture of India, which is, I must warn you, an acquired taste.

The first thing you may notice is the language, which entails what linguists call ""code switching."" Sentences often begin in Hindi and end in English or vice versa. But much more important to grasp is the Bollywood aesthetic, which is radically different from Hollywood's; to enjoy it requires a suspension of the rules that constrain American films. Ours have rather tightly defined genres: domestic drama, buddy picture, slasher movie, Broadway musical, sci-fi actioner, and so on. Combining two of them is rare; three is straight over the top.

Indian film, in contrast, is kitchen sink filmmaking, throwing together themes and plots from many diverse genres to create tales of epic scope (this one is nearly three hours long). These sagas whipsaw the viewer back and forth from farcical parody to ghastly tragedy to musical fantasy to weepy melodrama to toilet humor to social protest to romantic comedy. The plots are frequently Byzantine in their complexity and the characters hopelessly unrealistic. As in the Hindu epic Ramayana, they are better thought of as caricatures of love, wisdom, heroism, foolishness, envy, ambition, and other traits.

Now if you find a frenetic hodgepodge of styles and a resolute lack of realism irritating, if you can't accept what will at first seem crazily contradictory conventions, you won't like Bollywood. If repetitive fart and pee jokes bother you, if the idea of grafting a ""Revenge of the Nerds"" sensibility onto ""Mamma Mia!"" or of having Judd Apatow direct ""Days of Our Lives"" strikes you as horrifying, then this movie is not for you. But if you can wrap your head around these jarring juxtapositions, read on.

I'll admit I'm not a big Bollywood fan, but I have to give props to screenwriter-director Rajkumar Hirani for the manic energy and complete commitment he brings to his interpretation of ""Five Point Someone,"" a novel by Chetan Bhagat. ""3 Idiots"" centers on three students attending the most prestigious engineering college in India, a pressure cooker of a school. They include Farhan (R. Madhavan), who is an aspiring but frustrated photographer, and the impoverished Raju (Sharman Joshi). The charismatic leader of this triumvirate, Rancho (Kahn), is a witty prankster, a down-to-earth genius, and a humanitarian guru who makes it his mission to humble the arrogant: to show the educational authorities their wrongheadedness and the wealthy their hypocrisy.

While he's at it, this charming idealist saves the life of Raju's father, crashes a wedding, and wins the heart of Pia, a medical student (played by the beautiful Kareena Kapoor) who happens to be the daughter of his nemesis, the dean of the college. The dean is a heartless buffoon (played to the scenery-chewing hilt by Boman Irani) who is in the habit of driving his students to suicide, but Rancho gets the better of him. And all of this is accomplished before the first half of the movie is over!

The film could easily have ended at midpoint, but no. Rancho mysteriously disappears, and so his friends embark upon a quest that frames the plot, along with Chatur (Omi Vaidya), an envious rival who has made a wager with him. They attempt to track him down, settle the bet, and reunite him with his lost love. We move back and forth in time and tone with myriad subplots about exam results, summary expulsions, dreams deferred, job interviews, identity swaps, heartbreaking betrayals, near-death experiences, miraculous recoveries, and undying friendship.

There's a runaway bride scene that puts ""The Graduate"" to shame, and enough high-stakes medical drama for several soap operas, including paralysis, a coma, and a bizarre episode in which a team of engineering students uses car batteries and a vacuum cleaner to deliver a baby during a blackout. And interspersed with all of this are several wild song-and-dance numbers, one of them set in a communal bathroom and another that involves flying and a rainstorm and a cross between the Twist and the Chicken Dance.

In the end, justice is done and all's right with the world. The challenges our protagonists face -- of fulfilling their parent's old-fashioned expectations in a viciously competitive educational system and an utterly class-ridden society, or of following their own personal passions and finding happiness and untold wealth in the process -- are resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Our saintly hero finds true love and, after hours of teasing, gets a single kiss. We're in India, remember, where the good guys must be chaste (though cavorting in their underwear is apparently just fine).

It's a cheerfully preposterous film filled with fine performances, one of the most well-made pieces of pabulum I've seen since the cricket-themed colonial epic ""Laagan,"" a 2001 Aamir Khan movie of nearly four hours that received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. With a story that aspiring young Indians can relate to, ""3 Idiots"" was hugely popular at home, shattering all sorts of box office records and winning a ridiculous number of awards.

Would you like to know more about India, a place where tradition and modernity uneasily coexist? Then this marathon of broad tragicomedy and rags-to-riches wish fulfillment is an entertaining way to learn. Bear in mind that this is nothing like reality. It's hyperreality: what a nation of 1.2 billion who experience poverty and a daily grind and rapid social change are hoping for, not what you'll really find if you visit. As such, it reveals much about their mentality, about their ideals and anxieties, and about what motivates them. If you can let go of your American preconceptions, it's a head-spinning ride that's undeniably fun.",1308182400,100,6345,5.086455331412104
4324362,4,B004C1W1VY,"First of all, this is not your typical Bollywood film.  Aamir Khan loves to tackle topics that aren't traditionally spoken about in anything but gossip, but times they are a changing, and this film did an amazing job exploring the idea of a person choosing for himself the path of his life.  It's something that many of us take for granted, and another many give up their passions to fulfill the dreams of a parent or a society.  We are taught to chase success and give not a thought to quality of life or work we produce. This film seems to scream - don't do that.  Learn, don't memorize!  Live, don't be a robot! Don't allow fear to rule your life. *all is well*
I'll never understand how Aamir Khan, is so seemingly ageless! He looks as young as he did in Lagaan  so many years ago. If you enjoyed this movie, please also take a look at Like Stars on Earth (Taare Zameen Par), it is also entertaining, and especially poignant if you have a learning disability of are the parent of a child with a disability.
 Everyone should have a Rancho in their lives - a friend who lives your joys and sorrows as if they were his own, expecting nothing in return.  I love how little snippets of wisdom were just interspersed throughout the film, my favorite - ""Follow excellence, and success will chase you...pants down!""

4324363,5,B004C1W1VY,"This is an awesome comedy that also carries a very important social message about the dangerous pressures of ""the rat race"" in higher education.  It will leave you laughing yet thinking--a good combination.  See it.  You can't go wrong.",1307836800,,236,5.0
4324364,5,B004C1W1VY,"This is the fourth movie I've seen starring Aamir Khan and each time I'm more impressed with his ability as an actor.  I love the social message his movies send.  This movie is about 3 roommates who become lifelong friends at a prestigious engineering university and a fourth student who is only concerned with prestige, achievement and money.  It explores the pressure students at the university are under to succeed combined with family pressure to be an engineer, whether or not it's their passion.

I'm American but a huge Bollywood fan and while I'm used to the typical music-filled romance movies, this movie was refreshing and I immediately wanted the best for the characters from the beginning to the end.  That's not to say there's no romance.  Kareena Kapoor is a wonderful addition to the cast as Aamir's love interest, they complement each other well.  This movie flawlessly takes a comedic approach to a serious issue while appreciating the seriousness of the subject matter.  Honestly if mainstream Hollywood attempted this I probably would not have given this movie the time of day.

If you are new to Bollywood beware, movies tend to be at least 3 hours and this movie runs just short of that.  The first half begins as 2 of the main characters are looking for Aamir's character and their story in college is juxtaposed with it.  The second half focuses on their lives after college as they continue their journey.  It's not confusing, just more layered than most Hollywood movies.

I'd recommend this to anyone, Indian or not, Bollywood fan or not if nothing else for the message it sends: to go after your passion.  This movie displays friendship, love, sadness, challenges and comedy.",1307232000,2,1703,4.888501742160279
4324365,4,B004C1W1VY,"I don't see too many Hindi films, but now and then one pops up that crosses over to a more western sensibility. I've seen a few of those and they've been very good. 'Three Idiots' is one of the better I've seen.

Here's the scoop. Four students at an Indian Engineering university, three who become friends, struggle through the trials of being students in a high pressure environment. The smartest of the four thinks this is major B.S. He feels learning should be exciting and not the cause of suicides and a bee-line to a big paycheck. As a result he finds himself at constant odds with the anal-retentive big cheese. There are other sub plots but this is the main thrust.

This is a long (3 hours) involved story. It's by no means confusing, just involved. You get to know these people and feel for their circumstances. It's clever, insightful and touching. There is also quite a bit of humor thrown in so it doesn't get too leaden. The characters are cool, particularly the leader of the pack. He leads his buds astray which causes all sort of havoc that needs re-organizing. There are a couple of Bollywood dance numbers that are cool too. The acting is generally good. The sets, direction, cinematography are all top shelf. Some of the sentimental moments are a bit maudlin and some of the comedy doesn't play well to western sensibilities, but this is a very accessible film. And, in light of the current state of education in the United States, this is a subject matter many can take to heart.

At 3 hours you might need to brew so joe, but it's well worth it. This is a good movie by any standard and deserves a wide audience.",1306540800,2,1635,4.516891891891892

4324369,4,B004C1W1VY,"Aamir Khan's movies carry deep social messages, which catch the imagination of the masses in no time. Lagaan recreated the traditional theme of the weak taking on the powerful with dogged determination and ultimately winning because of unity and team building. Rang De Basanti had a serious social message for the youths, reminding them of their responsibilities. The movie almost awakened the youth from a metaphorical slumber and made it aware of its power.  Sarforosh and Dil Chahta Hai struck a chord with the youth of the nation, giving Khan an iconic status. More recently Peepli Live had great social relevance.

So far so good. 3 Idiots takes on the traditional education system, which is made out to be flawed, as it does not allow the students to pursue the career they cherish and to exploit their hidden potential. Aamir Khan (Rancho) and his friends Sharman Joshi and R. Madhavan join a prestigious engineering college, and immediately form a strong friendship. Aamir is the super brain among them, with original thinking and rebellious attitude. He feels claustrophobic in this hallowed portal of traditional learning.

Soon he converts his two friends to his line of thinking and the threesome revel in all kinds of pranks and trickery. Omi Vaidya plays a perfect foil to the three rebels, by toeing the established system. Vaidya's bizarre speaking style and funny acting brought him instant  fame in India. I remember the theatre reverberating in side-splitting laughter, during the scene in which Om describes the different styles of farting to an august audience, as his script had been altered by the trio.

While the first half of the movie keeps us busy in relishing the campus antics, the second half takes us to the post college life situations of our idiots and their bte noir, Omi Vaidya. It transpires that Aamir was indeed studying in college on a fake identity. Now that he had obtained the engineering degree for his master, he was living as a school teacher in the wilderness.

Well, the movie achieves what it intended to. However, I take issue on Aamir Khan's studying the course on a fake ticket. You cannot hope to right a wrong by taking a wrong, illegal and criminal route yourself. Going by the kind of fan following and influence Aamir Khan has on the youth, it will not be surprising if many are tempted to follow suit.

My next contention is about the movie's line of reasoning that the present system of higher education stifles originality and breeds frustration.  While this issue is best left to the sociologists and planners, I feel that the movie makes a sweeping conclusion. The present system regularly gives birth to many original thinkers, creative artistes and scientists, of which Aamir Khan himself, in both his real life and as Rancho, is a burning example.

India, as a knowledge society, has its grounding in the existing education system. Further rote learning system is not the only method prevalent in schools, unlike it is made out to be. If all the students of today follow the Rancho way, one can imagine the plight of their parents, many of whom find it hard to finance their kids' education.

I cried, I laught with them the whole way.

Then i had to finish watching it, now i have to have a copy.
It's one of those foreign film delight with so much heart, great film making, beautiful camera work,
and the message that entertains, engage, and change one's mind.

A film of excellence!",1292803200,6,403,4.493150684931507
