7933102,3,B000059H2E,"Great show based on excellent books. However, we failed to notice that these disks will not play on US DVD players. Our bad.",1487289600,,124,4.434782608695652
7933103,3,B000059H2E,Slow moving plot....but the story is good. The producers could have cut a lot of scenery out and added plot instead to make it better.,1470614400,,134,4.4
7933104,5,B000059H2E,Wonderful sci-fi movie. Got it for my son. I remember seeing it years ago and being very impressed by it.,1449532800,,105,4.3
7933105,5,B000059H2E,"Now you can purchase both the first and second series.  The Tripods is a BBC TV Series that came out in 1984 (Series 1 of 13 episodes) and 1985 (Series 2 of 12 episodes) based on the John Christopher Trilogy and to me it still holds up very well.  There is none of the blood & gore like you see today, no sexual innuendo or worse that is so prevalent today, but just good clean fun entertainment for the entire family.  For those who do not know the BBC only filmed the first and second book canceling the series before they could film the third and final book.  But fear not as there is a booklet included with the DVD giving a synopsis of the third book by John Christopher and also included is the synopsis of the 13 episode scripted but un-filmed series as they had gone so far as to scout locations for Series 3 before the show was officially cancelled but not before they wrote scripts for every episode of the 13 episode Series 3.  You get an overview and the BBC was going to be faithful with the book ending which shows that John Christopher who wrote the trilogy (now 4 books as he wrote one 20 years after the first 3 called ""When The Tripods Came"") knew human nature and I will not spoil this for you but let you discover the ending for yourself.

Now to watch the series you will need a Region Free DVD player as this is region 2 & 4 and will not play on United State Region 1 DVD players or your computer despite what some people say.  Today's computers and mine will only allow you to switch regions 5 time and once the counter reaches 0 you are stuck on that region even if you wipe your computer and reinstall the operating system.  It must be a security feature today as years ago I was able to watch on my computer then with no problem.  And I did switch regions on my computer but no luck it still would not play and now the counter on my computer is set at 4 for changes.  You will need to purchase a Region Free DVD Player which I did by purchasing a Toshiba and it play wonderfully and the picture is crystal clear.

Final notes on The Tripods DVD:

1) The DVD Transfer is excellent as the scenes are crystal clear & extremely sharp and the night or darkly lit scenes and now visible and you can see what the actors are doing.

2) You also have the Series 1 Recap narrated by the character of Will Parker to introduce viewers as to what happened in Series 1 to lead them to the beginning of Series 2.

3) 30 minute documentary called ""The Cult of The Tripods"" giving a great overview of the series.

4) Booklet covering ""The Unmade Third Series"" answering your questions on the third book.

This is an excellent series and product and once you combine it with a Region Free DVD player you will have 10  hours of viewing enjoyment.

If you really want to get to know The Tripods more check out ""The League of Freemen"" a Tripod based fan site on Yahoo Groups.  The cast, crew, and producer get together and meet in England & Germany almost yearly and there is a wealth of information including GPS coordinates so you can see every filming location as if you were actually there.  You can find The Tripod meetings on You Tube.

Also on You Tube you will find a channel called FritzEger which is actually Robin Hayter who played Fritz in Series 2 and he has Tripod and meeting videos there too.

Finally do not forgot to check out The Tripods DVD on Amazon here containing bonus material and the entire Series 1 & 2.

If you are a fan of The Tripods this DVD is a must for you and if you like adventure with a little science fiction thrown in then this is for you and I hope you enjoy the information I have included for you to explore this series more.",1374796800,4,3672,4.221745350500715
7933106,5,B000059H2E,"I just purchased this set for only $31.00 U.S. upon Amazon.co.uk.
Why these sellers are asking so much for a readily available title
sure mystifies me. Also the set upon Amazon.co.uk is the later of
the two released, consisting of four discs not two.
This is the best BBC series, in my opinion.",1248480000,2,294,4.566037735849057
7933107,5,B000059H2E,"Yes, this Series 1 DVD is very good. It starts off slow to a nice climatic end in the White Mountains. Series 2 DVD is just fantastic in the Tripod city. I loved watching this on PBS in the 80s. I'm glad I now have Series 1 and 2 on DVD, but alas Series 3 was never made by the BBC. And the stars are in there 40s, so it's not like they can reprise the roles. What could have been...",1218844800,2,383,3.740740740740741
7933108,5,B000059H2E,"I heard that this was the most expensive production undertaken by The BBC. It shows! The main problem was that they ran out of money before finishing the series. If CGI had been around then, the cost over-run probably wouldn't have occured. I have ordered ""John Christopher's book [The Pool of Fire] to find out the ending.",1210204800,10,323,4.684210526315789
7933109,5,B000059H2E,"This was a low budget version created for British TV back in the 80's.  If you can get past the low budget aspect of this feature you will be well pleased.  The story is faithfully followed.  The tension is there and the actors do an admirable job of conveying the characters emotions and motivations.  The special effects as mentioned are not anything special but they do the job.  You know when there is a Tripod there.

Be careful when buying this DVD as most editions were released as PAL Region Free format.  Many DVD players will only play NTSC and Region 1 in the US.  Make sure that your player can handle the stated specs unless you are sure the copy you are buying is NTSC Region 1.

Worth the find.  It is too bad it was never completely released and was never mastered for the US market.  There is a theatrical release version being prepared for a 2009 release at the time of this writing.",1207699200,19,901,4.367469879518072
7933110,5,B000059H2E,"This is a wonderful T.V. series. It stays fairly close to the books so the scripts are well written and the acting is great. Though it is missing what is contained in the third book, what it does have is superb.

I really hope to see this available on DVD with DVD quality audio and video soon.",1132963200,25,294,4.157894736842105
