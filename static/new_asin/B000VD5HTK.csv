It will have to be played several times with the pause button and supplemental material, but it never claimed to be a complete course....so, it will do. I would buy again.",1441756800,,334,4.317460317460317

8218093,3,B000VD5HTK,"Based upon the cover and the written description, I did not realize this DVD was intended for students 13 and under.  It is passable for freshmen who are well-behaved and will not be put off by the hokey aspects.",1370304000,2,212,4.435897435897436

8218095,3,B000VD5HTK,"I have no real complaint about the young man and young woman who rush us through this introduction to the elements of fiction. And the technical make-up was OK. I knew pretty much what I was getting when I ordered it. A half-hour summation of the elements of fiction. I think I would have preferred that it be about 9.95 instead of nearly $15. It's a good intro for students who have no clue about literary elements, and a refresher for those who need it. So I won't trash it, but for those who want something with a little more depth - and that includes any writer wannabe - then I'd advise you not to waste your money. Also,  the description was somewhat misleading; there are only two ""experts,"" lady professors I've never heard of, and there were no excerpts from literary giants to illustrate a point. Really light-weight stuff, so pay attention to who you're buying it for. I know some students I may give my copy to.

The bottom line is that it's not worthless to people just learning about literature, but to those who know more than the basics, it's a waste of time to bother with it.",1237420800,17,1093,4.432835820895522
8218096,4,B000VD5HTK,"I teach Oral Interpretation at a University and I find this series of videos very useful. Most of the freshmen I see are able to pass tests and write papers, but they don't understand or appreciate literature. This video helps get the facts out quickly and clearly so I can spend the rest of my semester on the stuff I'm really supposed to be teaching.",1075334400,2,352,4.430769230769231
