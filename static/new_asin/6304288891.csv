835858,3,6304288891,"The further he recedes into history, the more I seem to appreciate Ronald Reagan. As an actor. He was really pretty good. He put it to good use in politics I might add. An early effort when he was a contract player was Brother Rat. He co-stars behind his fellow VMI cadets, played by Eddie Albert & Wayne Morris. They're ready to graduate if they can stay out of trouble & away from the girls. Unlikely. They are played by Priscilla Davis (the star) Jane Bryant (the pregnant one) & Jane Wyman (Ronnie's girl). They are uniformly cute, perky & smart but incredibly naive. This is 1938 after all. High energy comedy. This is where Reagan met his first wife, Ms Wyman. They became a couple. What publicity. In fact by the time the sequel came along, Brother Rat & a Kid, they were either engaged or married. Lots of clean hi-jinks as they use to say. A fun movie.",1238803200,3,861,4.3875
835859,5,6304288891,Excellent quality; delivered promptly. Enjoyed by two families and will be for years. This was purchased by the grandparents of a VMI RAT.,1230422400,4,138,5.043478260869565
835860,3,6304288891,"Wayne Morris, Ronald Reagan, and Eddie Albert star as three senior cadets in their final year at the Virginia Military Academy.  The question that hangs over them is whether they will graduate, since they have a talent for getting themselves into trouble.  Morris drags Reagan into many of his schemes, including chasing girls, while Albert has caught his girl, marrying her (which is against the rules).  To top it off, she's also pregnant.  The cast is up for the various shenanigans, playing their parts with a lot of energy.  Albert is particularly memorable as the cadet trying to concentrate on graduating while his personal life is upside down.  The girls are played by Priscilla Lane, Jane Bryan, and Jane Wyman.  Only Wyman really makes an impression.  It's fun to see life in the Academy and to see Reagan and Wyman before they were big stars.  Some of the humour wears thin and there are certain lapses in logic, but everyone is so likeable it's easy to overlook.",1027123200,9,974,4.7844311377245505
835951,3,6304288891,It was average as far as black and white comedies go but am satisfied overall with purchase.,1422662400,,92,4.470588235294118
835952,5,6304288891,"Years ago my husband and watched Brother Rat from a library VHS and loved it. Over the years we have wanted to re-watch it, but it wasn't available. When I saw that it was available as a DVD-R was a little worried about the quality of picture, but it met our expectations and we are thrilled that we can once again enjoy this film and share it with our children.",1421798400,,362,4.185714285714286
835953,4,6304288891,Great movie. Disc arrived damaged.,1421452800,,34,6.0
835954,4,6304288891,"but it helps.  As a VMI graduate, enjoyed the movie because it showed that much of the Institute did not change from the late 30's to the late 60's.  The story is a bit zany, but the acting is good and the actors pull off an improbable story line.  Funny to think that Reagan and Wyman were not the headliners!  A ""buddy movie,"" think of it like a ""Friends"" episode in a  1930's military college.",1420329600,2,396,4.226666666666667

835957,5,6304288891,A fun watch. Totally campy! A return to a simpler time! LOVED it,1411689600,,64,4.0
835958,2,6304288891,"I have wanted to watch this movie ever since I first heard about it, thinking it would at least have some scenes of VMI and a plot that included some of the daily life of a VMI cadet. Not even close. I know this movie was made at a time when ""hi-jinks"" were considered humorous but, to be honest, this was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. A silly plot and wooden acting by one of the 3 ""cadets&#34 and over-acting by another; made for a long and disappointing viewing. Ronald Reagan's character was the only one of the 3 cadets who appeared and behaved like a VMI cadet. I understand there was a sequel. I won't be buying it. I'm loaning this movie to my sons and their friends (all VMI graduates) so they won't spend their money on it. They may get some laughs out of it that I didn't.",1372204800,,797,4.181818181818182
835959,5,6304288891,"My son is in fact a ""rat"" at VMI. The family really enjoyed seeing VMI as it was in the late 1930s. The movie certainly goes to show that tradition is a big part of VMI as much of the terminology used by the characters was familiar to my son. I would highly recommend the movie, especially if you have any relationship with VMI.",1294790400,,328,4.140625
835960,4,6304288891,We enjoyed this although it is not a fine film. With VMI so close by it was fun to hear area places mentioned.,1252713600,,110,3.8260869565217392

The movie was adapted from a play written by two former cadets, so I have to believe the screenplay varied greatly from the original.",1425168000,,301,4.189655172413793
