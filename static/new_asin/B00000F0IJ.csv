1202219,3,B00000F0IJ,"Every movie made in the early 1940s had to promote the war effort, and this 1943 movie is no exception.

The movie begins with the launching of the warship ""Jack London"", then does a quicky on Jack's poverty, a few scenes of his life at sea, one scene of his education at Berkeley, a few scenes in the gold rush, a quicky of his relationship with Charmian, then spends the last 40% of the movie on anti-Japanese propaganda, giving a detailed presentation of Jack's experiences as a war correspondent (which probably lasted a few months) covering the Japanese-Russian War.

No mention is made of Jack's first marriage to Bess or his two daughters by her.  No mention is made of Jack's long-term membership in the Socialist Party or his public resignation from that party when he considered them hypocrites.  No mention is made of Jack's self-education that took him far beyond a college education or of the IQ he must have had to be able to go so far on his own.

As a movie, the film is streaked, the sound ratty.  The Californian Jack London is played by a guy with a strong Brooklyn accent.  (This is a switch from today when every character of every nationality and time period speaks with a California accent.)

Bottom line: Read London's autobiographical novel ""Martin Eden"".  It's his best novel and will give you a better feel for the man than any of the biographies, each of which has one ax or another to grind.",1144972800,17,1420,4.5810276679841895

7906704,3,B00000F0IJ,"Released in 1943, This is almost like two separate movies.
The first half is an entertaining, but somewhat inaccurate rendering of London's early life, which provided source material for a lot of his stories.
I would rate it 4 1/2 -5.
The second half devolves into a period propaganda piece with London warning of the long-term global expansionist ambitions of the Japanese Empire. Viewed from 70 years later, it's almost comedic history.
Susan Hayward's role raises the second half to 2 stars.",1458432000,2,494,5.036585365853658

7906710,2,B00000F0IJ,"""Jack London"" is a 1943 film devoted to the life of the famous novelist. The film stars Michael O'Shea as London. O'Shea does a decent job with the role, although the script is full of inaccuracies and is nothing but a caricature of London's life. Costarring Susan Hayward as London's second wife Charmian (his first marriage and children are totally ignored) the film starts off with a liberty ship bearing his name being commissioned to go fight the Japanese. The irony of the US Navy naming a ship after ardent socialist London is something to make one marvel as much now as then, but the film makes the connection by showing London's early experiences as a sailor and oyster fisherman.

The account of his education at Berkley is likewise inaccurate, but it does act as a springboard to introduce his writing and journalism careers. Not everything here is incorrect, but much of it is misleading due to what's omitted. Besides the somewhat errant wartime value of extolling London as a rugged individualist (that may have been true early in his life) and all-American hero, the film falls short on a number of levels and is extremely choppy. Jack goes to the Yukon looking for gold, then visits England to cover the Boer War! Finally, see him accused of being a Russian spy, an act requiring decisive Presidential intervention! There's all this and much, much more though the script is more like several Hardy Boys stories stitched together than an accurate biographical accounting.

Based on the merits of O'Shea's and Louise Beavers' performances, the film is worth two stars. If you are searching for anything remotely like a nonfiction docudrama, don't look here. If you are simply fascinated by all things London, feel free to enjoy with the obvious caveats.",1345420800,3,1767,4.906354515050167

7906712,3,B00000F0IJ,"Jack London, 1943 film

The film begins by showing the launching of a Liberty Ship named after the subject of this film. Then the credits are shown on pages of a book. The story begins in 1890 Oakland California. There was an accident at a canning factory. ""Everybody back to work."" The 12-hour workday affects workers. Jack London doesn't like these working conditions. Mammy Jenny will loan him money so he can work for himself by harvesting oysters from the bay. ""Oyster pirates?"" Mamie stays on the boat and they get a partner. On their return the police shoot at them! Jack signs on to a sealing ship as one of the crew. They play a trick on a sailor. Jack defends himself, he wants to be a writer. Jack writes about what he saw. Then Jack goes to the Yukon to search for gold and sees more of life. The news of a gold strike creates a swarm of prospectors. Does hardship and brutality cause a human to revert to a primitive savage?

Jack meets Charmian Kittredge, they ride horses. Has Civilization reached its apex at the turn of the century? [Every society thinks its better than the past.] Does greed rule society? Jack will report on the Boer War, but it ended before he got there. His next assignment is the Russo-Japanese War. ""Sometimes it is not practical for the world to know what is going on."" Jack goes to Korea to see the war. Jack meets Captain Tanaka (of the Kempei Tai). A map shows Japan's sphere of influence. Does it conflict with other countries? [This was a war-time movie.] Jack's luck runs out, he is jailed for trespassing. Russian prisoners are thirsty, they are shot down after breaking out of jail to provide an atrocity scene. President Teddy Roosevelt asks for his release. Jack tries to warn about Japan's future plans. ""Nobody will believe you."" Jack and Charmian kiss.

This is a simplified version of Jack London's life. The ""American Rudyard Kipling"" is no longer popular, tastes have changed over time. There is no mention of ""The Abyss"", his story about the London of Great Britain. The victories of the Labor Party resulted in a change for the better after the bombing of the Blitz led to rebuilding.",1267488000,3,2143,4.604712041884817
