8695366,5,B00RI5KLVI,"This new, Blu-ray collection of Vertov's seminal works is one of the best transfers I've ever seen; and you will not believe the quality of ""Man with a Movie Camera.""  The scoring by the Alloy Orchestra, following Vertov's own, written notes, is nearly as impressive.  What makes this DVD so incredible is the framing -- yes, it's 4:3, of course, but it's the original without any ""bump"" from the added musical score.  I'm absolutely blown away by the sharpness of detail, and the overall tonalities.  This is surely the way Vertov hoped it would be seen.  I had never seen any episodes of Kino-Pravda or Kino-Glaz, and was stunned by the depth of Vertov's ""true belief.""  The episodes from each newsreel series are paeans to Socialism rather than news per se, but you can see some hints of the mind behind what would become ""Man with a Movie Camera.""  I wish the same could be said for ""Entuziazm/Symphony Dombassa.""  While there are some intriguing elements derived from Vertov's own theory of cinema, it is, overall, a repetitive, somber enlistment ad for Socialism.",1443139200,,1069,4.835164835164835
