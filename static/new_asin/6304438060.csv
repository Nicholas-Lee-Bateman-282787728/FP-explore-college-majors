877871,4,6304438060,"The old DVD of Innerspace came with a Dolby Stereo (Surround) track faithful to the original mix and a 5.1 DD track. I never listened to the 5.1, and I'm glad I never had to. This Blu-ray, like many rereleases, drops the Stereo track, and on my first listen to the 5.1 I thought my speakers were going bad. They weren't. Throughout the movie, there is a low crackling sound during dialogue, and I don't know where it came from, but it's present on the DVD's 5.1, and it's retained here. I can't watch the movie this way. I love the movie. It's fun, on the lighter/more-accessible side of the Dante ouevre, and the picture upgrade is nice; but unless Warner fixes this or I find some way to marry the HD picture with the original sound, I can't enjoy this Blu-ray. (Not surprisingly, the WB logos have also been anachronistically updated at the start and end, and it makes for a ridiculous show when the longer new WB logo at the start is silent for a moment and joined by the correct old fanfare. Add to that the usual modern lack of chapter names and I don't see this as a great upgrade. The DVD's commentary and trailer are retained, bios and stuff are dropped, and nothing new is added. Save your DVDs.)",1502064000,2,1206,4.388392857142857

It takes the relatively novel idea of miniaturization inside a human body  - attempted only once before with 1966's ""Fantastic Voyage"" - and infuses it with both heart and humor.  ""Innerspace"" is an immensely enjoyable, energetic and clever 1980s sci-fi action/comedy with top-notch special effects that won an Oscar.  Equally impressive are Jerry Goldsmith's score and the performances.  Dennis Quaid and Martin Short have superb chemistry, yet amazingly never share the screen together.  Meg Ryan is also appealing in one of her early film roles.  This movie is definitely underrated and deserves way more attention than it gets.",1453248000,3,739,5.318965517241379

Jack Putter [Martin Short] feels funny today, nothing new to this 25-hour-a-day a hypochondriac Safeway grocery clerk. Whats new is that Jack hears something, and declares Im possessed! And you're about to be possessed by laughter.

GREMLINS executive producer Steven Spielberg and director Joe Dante, again rev their imagination into overdrive for this comic adventure that won a 1987 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects. The voice Jack Putter hears is that of hotshot Lt. Tuck Pendleton [Dennis Quad], subject of a secret miniaturization technology project gone awry and accidently injected into Jack Putter. And before frazzled Jack Putter can say, Ive got you under my skin, his unlikely partner propels him into the craziest escapade of his life.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: INNERSPACE [1987] is definitely the sort of sci-fi comedy/adventure that is sorely missing from today's multiplex cinemas. Because INNERSPACE strikes a real perfect balance between the various genres it encompasses, turning it into one of the more entertaining sci-fi films out there.

Dennis Quaid stars as Lt. Tuck Pendleton, a disgraced soldier who's offered one last chance at redemption in the form of a top-secret government experiment. He is to be miniaturized to a microscopic size and injected into a rabbit, but the reasoning behind the experiment is never made entirely clear. But, moments after being shrunk down, several bad guys burst into the experimental laboratory with the intent of stealing the two chips required for miniaturization, which one of course just happens to be with miniaturised since it's with Lt. Tuck Pendleton. But brave scientist [John Hora] grabs the syringe that's holding Lt. Tuck Pendleton and heads for the street, only to be chased by the over-the-top histrionics sinister assassin with a robotic arm [Vernon Wells]. Needless to say, the scientist is shot and killed, but not before he injects Lt. Tuck Pendleton into the nearest warm body, who just happens to be hypochondriac Jack Putter [Martin Short]. Now, Lt. Tuck Pendleton and Jack Putter have to work together to try and get Lt. Tuck Pendleton out of there while avoiding the various goons hot on their tail.

It is all out-there type premises and it works beautiful, due to the enthusiasm of all the actors and the lightning-fast pace action comedy. It's the kind of film that, provided you are willing to suspend your disbelief in a big way, is almost impossible to dislike at all and is one of my all-time favourite sci-fi comedy film. The two leads, Dennis Quaid and Martin Short, have great chemistry together, which in itself makes the film worth watching. Dennis Quaid is totally perfect as the leading man, and he has the charming exterior you want in this type of fast paced action comedy film. As for Martin Short, he is definitely your Jerry Lewis to Dennis Quaid's Dean Martin, his physical antics never go too far; it's believable within the context of the film and within the confines of all their characters.

The brilliant Director Joe Dante keeps it brisk and fast paced, and because the film runs around two hours, that's really saying something and never gets dull or wanes throughout the film, because the structure of the film makes this all possible, because it doesn't flow in quite the way you'd expect, especially with the film transpires with different chunks of plots cropping up every now and then. For per example, is when in the early part of the film eventually deals with Martin Short's gradual acceptance of Dennis Quaid's presence in his body, that has some hilarious moments that will make you laugh out loud, and especially with a sequence that comes later on where we follow Martin Short's attempt in passing himself off as the mysterious chip dealer named The Cowboy [Robert Picardo]. It all comes together in the end, with an action sequences that features several plot strands being resolved at the same time.

As we trip the light fantastic throughout the film, you will experience the WOW factor, and you will definitely say, What a movie! And with all the bells and whistles, theres a genuine heartfelt story here. Lt. Tuck Pendleton is a drunk and he screws up the one night he spends with Lydia at the beginning of the film. At one point, Jack Putter and Lydia kiss and Lt. Tuck Pendleton is thrown into Lydias body where he comes face to face with his future child. Jack Putter becomes a better person by virtue of being forced out of his comfort zone and Lt. Tuck Pendleton realises what he has in front of him as he sees Jack Putter interact with Lydia. We also have a supporting cast of veteran character actors, all of whom have at least one memorable moment. The technical aspects of the film are top-notch, especially with the help of the Industrial Light and Magics Dennis Muren who won his fifth OSCAR for producing the brilliant visual effects so realistic that Roger Ebert thought they had put a miniature camera inside Martin Short. Plus of course with Jerry Goldsmiths score combines elements of romance, sci-fi, Americana, and every time The Cowboy shows up, we get a brilliant comical twang!

INNERSPACE casually leaps from sci-fi genre to sci-fi genre, and it really works beautifully perfect. The film is a pure joyous entertainment genre, with plenty of gags to keep the film moving along and cameos galore that demand repeat viewings. But it all comes down to the two lead performances of Dennis Quaid and Martin Short, because they are totally fantastic dynamic duo, and it's easy enough to wish that they'd team up again in some future film project, oh well we can only hope and dream that time will come eventually. INNERSPACE starts off with a terrific high-concept premise, and while we learn about how it all works, Joe Dante builds up the momentum really well, especially with good science fiction combined with state-of-the-art special effects, as you'd expect from a Steven Spielberg produced film, and definitely stays wry and intelligent throughout the film, that gives us a totally very solid sci-fi funny film, and especially all who were involved in resulting in making this a brilliant tour-de-force film.

Finally, as a fitting tribute to the brilliant composer Jerry Goldsmith, who is so greatly missed, as he was a total genius when it comes to totally memorable composed film music scores. With the film INNERSPACE was a comical remake and tribute to the Fantastic Voyage film. But with INNERSPACE is given wonderful brilliant decent special effects that are helped along the way with an active brilliant orchestral score provided by veteran professional composer Jerry Goldsmith. The composer Jerry Goldsmith and director Joe Dante had collaborated multiple times previously, with the most recent pairing leading to an adventurous and creative score for EXPLORERS, and their works together would extend to the composer's very last effort in 2003. In many regards, the environment of INNERSPACE would offer Jerry Goldsmith a broad canvas very similar to that of EXPLORERS, and the composer Jerry Goldsmith approached the INNERSPACE film with nearly an identical treatment of orchestral and electronic elements in his  distinctive blend of the era. The resulting music would take the form of a serviceable action score, sustained by Jerry Goldsmith's usual, strong sense of rhythmic propulsion and bold instrumentation. At the same time, the true sense of raw energy and child-like enthusiasm that is present in the film INNERSPACE leads to a workmanlike atmosphere that engages the listener very actively. The consistency of the harmonic action material presented in INNERSPACE film is to be totally commended. With the film INNERSPACE, Jerry Goldsmith approaches the science fiction genre elements with a genuine eye for action and suspense.

Blu-ray Video Quality  INNERSPACE [1987] has a brilliant cinematography by the Hungarian Andrew Laszlo that gives us a totally brilliant 1080p encoded image Blu-ray release is truly impressive and of course is helped with an equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio, especially when one considers the wide variety of locations, interiors and pre-digital in-camera effects shots that have been effectively reproduced to bring INNERSPACE a spectacular rollercoaster ride for all who view this fantastic Blu-ray release. Detail and sharpness are impressive throughout, whether in close-ups of characters in intense conversation or in long shots filled with people in objects. Even in the dingy and deliberately under light environs of Vectorscope, which we find out is supposed to look underfunded, especially with all of the equipment, personnel and disorder are visible. Whereas Scrimshaw's lab is hi-tech, is over bright fluorescent, equally with great detailed. So all in all INNERSPACE has been rendered with a visibly fine and natural grain pattern that shows no signs of artificial sharpening or filtering, and will be a totally pleasing visual experience, especially to all fans of this brilliant sci-fi comedy film.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  INNERSPACE [1987] was originally released in Dolby Surround on 35mm film, as well as a 6-track mix for a 70mm blow-up print. But here with the Warner Home Video 2015 release we have it 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. The most awesome use of the surround sounds in INNERSPACE involves when Lt. Tuck Pendleton's ""pod"" adventures begins with his miniaturization in a huge centrifuge and continuing throughout his organic voyage. INNERSPACE really benefits from the brilliant great score by the late Jerry Goldsmith, whom Joe Dante praises for striking a perfect balance between drama and comedy. The orchestral performance plays with the best fidelity I have heard in a very long time and definitely gets a 5 star rating from me.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Joe Dante, Producer Michael Finnell, Co-stars Kevin McCarthy and Robert Picardo and Visual Effects Supervisor Dennis Muren: First up to introduce themselves is Joe Dante, who informs us that he was the director of INNERSPACE, and Joe Dante then introduces Michael Finnell, who informs us he was one of the producers of the film. Next up to introduce themselves is Dennis Muren who is the supervisor for the Industrial Light and Magic organisation. Next up to introduce themselves is Kevin McCarthy who was Victor Scrimshaw, who was one of the bad guys in the film and last of all we are introduced to Robert Picardo, who of course was the famous doctor in the TV Sci-Fi Series Star Trek: Voyager. Joe Dante talks about how cool the Title sequence at the start of the film that was designed by Wayne Fitzgerald, who was professional American main title designer. Joe Dante also informs us that they tried all different film titles, but eventually stuck with INNERSPACE, but one film title they thought of was Fantastic Voyage II, but again stuck with the original title of INNERSPACE. When Dennis Quaid makes his really stupid drunken entrance in the film, Joe Dante points out that standing behind Meg Ryan is Jeffrey Boam the screenwriter, who you also get to see briefly interviewed by Meg Ryan, as Joe Dante likes to include behind-the-scene people in his films. We also find out the part that Dennis Quaid was originally supposed to be a part for a much older person who is at the end of their career, but it was Steven Spielberg who thought Dennis Quaid would be perfect for the part, even though he was 32 years of age when the 1987 film was made. When we get to see Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan at the top of the hill in San Francisco where the taxi is waiting, they mention the taxi driver is the actor Dick Miller who Joe Dante calls him his Lucky Charm and has appeared in many of Joe Dante films, and of course one of those films was the brilliant MANT! [1993]. They all talk about the first film Preview in Sacramento and the audiences went wild with enthusiasm, so that meant Warner Bros. did have to spend a lot on publicity, the film sold itself. We hear also an interesting fact that hear when Dennis Quaid is shrunk, the main scientist is John Hora, who is in fact not a proper actor, and Joe Dante felt he wanted to bring something different to the film and they wanted John Hora to act like an absent minded professor and we are told he totally improvised all what he said in the film. Also all the technical bods behind you see are in fact actual scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. But when the bad guys enter the building, we get a cameo appearance of Joe Dante, especially when they spray him with the sleeping gas in the corridor. When martin Short arrives at his Doctor again and he is sitting down in the waiting room, Joe Dante mentions that Joe Flaherty and Andrea Martin, who are in the Doctors waiting room with Martin Shaw, are old friends of Joe Dante. One of the most brilliant gems of information is when we see Martin Short arrives late for his job in the supermarket and arrives at the checkout, standing in the que behind the actress Laura Waterbury, is Rance Howard [Ron Howards Dad] and Chuck Jones the famous Warner Bros. Cartoonist and in-between shots Chuck Jones would drew loads of Bugs Bunny cartoons for free and handed them out to all the extras, the cast and all the crew. When we are on the plane we first see the entrance of Robert Picardo and at that moment I didn't recognise him, but informs us that he had a special wig made up to look like the now deceased Arab leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi [Former Prime Minister of Libya] and Robert Picardo is about to sit down, we see the entrance of his specially designed flashy crocodile skin boots that he still has. When we see Robert Picardo arrive at the INFERNO disco venue, we are told it is in fact the frontage of the THE HOLLYWOOD PALACE in San Francisco, but the inside shots were in the Palladium Night Club in Sunnyvale in San Francisco. When Martin Short and Meg Ryan are escaping in the car, the two baddies in the back of the car, well this was done with an old Hollywood trick, where the back seat was double the normal size; to give the perspective the two actors were shrunk. When Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan get married, you suddenly see Robert Picardo carrying the large suitcase that he puts in the back of the limousine; well the suitcase was actually life size so the two actors could get inside it, especially when Robert Picardo closes the suitcase. Near the end of the film when Martin Short jumps into the red spots car and chases off after the limousine; the critics thought it indicated there was to be a sequel, but Joe Dante informs us that there was never ever going to be a sequel and had no idea where that information came from. So ends another fascinating audio commentary and it was really brilliant hearing all 5 audio commentators, who all have a great deal of fun talking about the film INNERSPACE and all the fun behind-the-scenes information that went into making the film, as well hearing all their fun anecdotes, so all in all, this is again a brilliant audio commentary and you to will also have a great deal of fun hearing what Joe Dante, Michael Finnell,  Kevin McCarthy, Robert Picardo and Dennis Muren had to say.

Theatrical Trailer [1987] [1080i] [1.77:1] [1:30] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for INNERSPACE where the voice over declares, ""Now Jack's got twice the problems, but he's twice the man,"" and is a very good presentation on what people will expect from the fun filled sci-fi film caper from the Steven Spielberg organisation. The only thing that lets it down, is that it is a very grainy print.

Finally, Joe Dantes sci-fi film INNERSPACE does not outstay its welcome, never overreaches itself with high concept nor forces us to dally in sentiment or any kind of genuine emotion. Its flat-packed Hollywood, but once upright surely stays that way. It doesn't have that slightly dark edge of Joe Dante's other works, but with the brilliant performances of Dennis Quad, Martin Short and Meg Ryan make it a joy from start to finish. Everything in the film, the love story, the inspired physical comedy, the cartoonish bad guys and their well-deserved fates, is totally timeless. Warner Home Video has produced a Blu-ray version of INNERSPACE that was worth the wait and is will be highly praised by all fans of this film. Highly Recommended!

It's a Joe Dante film, with early performances by Dennis Quaid, Martin Short and Meg Ryan.

It's goofier than all get out; here's the synopsis.

Dennis Quaid is a loose cannon test pilot with a bit of an alcohol problem, who gets ""demoted"" to a secret military program involving miniaturization. He is to be shrunk down, along with a mini-submarine, and injected into a lab rabbit, to test things like the ability to hook up to a host's optic or auditory nerve.

Meg Ryan plays a reporter, romantically involved with Quaid, but for the moment, estranged.

Martin Short plays a hypochondriac supermarket assistant manager.

So, Quaid gets shrunk right before ""the bad guys"" (led by an over-the-top Kevin McCarthy) invade the laboratory, and in his last act as a living person, the escaping lead investigator injects the microscopic Quaid into Short's left buttock.

Hilarity ensues.

878910,3,6304438060,"when i found that Innerspace was finally getting a blu-ray reissue,
i thought Great i'll look forward to buying that
to my Disgust i then found out that Warner bros have reissued the film with no new special features tragically
Warner bros have a very bad habit of releasing old classics on blu-ray
and either just recycling the extras from the old version or adding no extras at all
WB obviously don't give a Damn about the fans of old classics

this new blu-ray has new HD transfer in 2:35:1 ratio and a new 5.1 master mix
WB however di make an effort with this new HD transfer
the picture quality does look very Good infact nice, sharp and clear picture, not much Grain or Dirt
much better quality then the 2001 dvd version
the new 5.1 Master audio mix does boost the sound quality big time much better sounding than the old dvd version of course
so probably best to upgrade from the very old dvd version
tragically no new extras obviously
WB did not bother getting new interviews with Joe Dante, steven spielberg, Dennis Quaid or Meg ryan, or Martin short
for a retrospective featurette which they should've done for sure
only the same dvd commentary track from the old dvd has been carried over that is it.
which some of the commentary is worth listening to and some of it isn't
that's why a retrospective featurette would've been better rather than relying on an old commentary track
and theatrical trailer of course is included
this new blu-ray is only worth $5 because of no new extras it's just a recycle except for a new HD transfer that's about it
so it's only Good for upgrading to blu-ray quality for only $10 or less
4 stars for the film, 2-3stars for this new blu-ray based an excellent HD transfer and a new 5.1 master mix
if there was new special features eg new retrospective featurette i would give about 5 stars
so only worth 3 stars if that",1438819200,,1861,4.473529411764706

Like Fantastic Voyage, which preceded it by twenty years, Innerspace won an Academy Award for special effects that simulated the interior of a human bodygreat effects, actually, considering they were accomplished before the advent of computer-generated images. In Voyage, a team of doctors was miniaturized and injected into a human being in a dramatic attempt to save an important political life. But Innerspace director Joe Dante (Small Soldiers) opts for low comedy, not high drama, with Batmanesque villains, pre-Mask morphing, and more than one Austin Powers-style mini-me.

A young looking Dennis Quaid stars as Lt. Tuck Pendleton, a bad-boy Navy pilot with a weakness for alcohol and Lydia, the reporter-girlfriend (Meg Ryan) who walked out on him. Tuck resigns his commission to pilot a submersible pod for an independent lab working on miniaturization. But instead of being Innerspacescreeninjected into a rabbit, as planned, when an industrial terrorist raid interrupts the procedure and a lab technician flees with the syringe containing the tiny Tuck, the pilot is injected instead into the bloodstream of Jack Putter, a frazzled milquetoast supermarket clerk (Martin Short). In a relationship that becomes symbiotic out of sheer necessity, Tuck and Jack party in order to bond, then work together to battle personal defects, the bad guys, and (tick, tick) time. Tucks oxygen supply is limited, you see, and he needs a microchip the villains have in order to coordinate his reentry into peopledom. But its a double search, because the evil Victor Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy)a comic cross between Mr. Freeze and The Penguinhas one microchip and needs Tucks in order to complete the technology theft, and he and his henchmen, his oversexed lead doctor (Fiona Lewis), and industrial spy/hit man The Cowboy (Robert Picardo) will do anything to get it.

Since Quaid spends most of the movie sitting inside the pod, its a tall order for Short to provide all of the visual action and handle most of the proxy interaction with Ryan. But like Paul Blart, Mall Cop, Shorts character rises to the challenge and the trio has a project chemistry that really makes this otherwise lightweight film an engaging adventureespecially on widescreen and in high def. Together, they really sell the situation. Even when Jack begins to fall for Lydia and compete for her attentions, its totally crediblewhich balances the tonally cartoonish villains.

For a while, we thought we should call it Fantastic Voyage 2, Dante quips, adding that they chose Innerspace instead because no one could come up with a better title. Dante teams with producer Michael Finnell and co-stars McCarthy and Picardo on a commentary track thats almost as entertaining as the film. Warner Brothers marketing people get roasted, as does Martin Short for bowing out of the commentary, and Quaid for refusing. As the camera pans across the laboratory, one of them tells how the extras were all real scientists from a nearby jet-propulsion laboratory. As the memorable bonding scene between Tuck and Jack runs, another remarks, I cant believe that we were gonna cut that scene. And as the camera pulls closer to the heart valve opening and closing like the beak of the giant squid in 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, threatening to swallow up Tucks pod and kill them both, one of them laughs, The heart valve opening and closing? Two guys with sticks pulling as fast as they can!

Dante and Finnell said that early on they realized that Innerspace was a good audience movie, and self-deprecating humor aside, Innerspace holds up better than Fantastic Voyage precisely because they don't take themselves or what they're doing too seriously. Yes, the hair is dated and some of the special effects now seem rudimentary, but the laughs are still here, and the action is pure fun. And its rated PG. Innerspace is one of the better, older comedy-adventures and a great candidate for family movie night. Unlike Fantastic Voyage, this one seems to get better with age. Right now at Amazon Innerspace is selling for under $10 on Blu-ray, and the price seems righter if you consider the repeat play this one is going to get.

Language: No f-bombs, but a few milder d, s, and h words
Sex: Just a swapping spit kiss thats a plot device
Violence: Fighting, some shooting, a body dissolving to skeleton
Adult situations: Drunkenness, assassin stripped to his shorts
Takeaway: Parodies can actually have a life of their own.

The stock characters: arrogant hero, self-esteem challenged anti-hero, plucky heroine and ultra-villan  are portrayed with a dexterity that removes them from the stereotypical images we expect. Martin Short endears and inspires as he stumbles into international intrigue and science well beyond the comprehension of the man on the street. Dennis Quaid, a washed up jet pilot, a former top gun, finds himself praying for one last chance to be an astronaut--in the most unlikely of galaxies. Meg Ryan avoids being the annoying disbelieving ex-girlfriend by catching on quickly that this may be an extraordinary adventure and career changing opportunity.

Granted it was a 1987 comedy with a unique twist of a ""Fantastic Voyage""-like environment, but the jokes fell flat, the plotting was contrived, and the story went on far too long.

I remember this movie as the sequel to Fantastic Voyage a 60's movie that was an instant classic, My innerspace edit on you tube is available. Innerspace is a modern version of fantastic voyage where a person or crew is miniaturized and injected into a human body, suppose to be a rabbit. Poor bugs bunny.

Well written witty dialogue, takes a humorous jab at the military, computers, technology, psychology, and the ""illnesses"" of modern society.  Sounds lofty but you will see what I mean when you watch it.
The scene of Martin Short in the doctor's waiting room is one of my all time favorites.

I actually think that this DVD is much better then the original VHS version with the standard widescreen as the VHS version is so $h1tty.

July 1, 1987
USA
Director: Joe Dante
Writers: Chip Proser - story, Jeffrey Boam - screenplay
Stars: Dennis Quaid, Martin Short, Meg Ryan

Want a good laugh with a dose of action?  A young Dennis Quaid as Tuck Pendleton wanted to be an astronaut, but wsas scrubbed from the space program.  Now he is to be shrunk and put in a rabbit.  Yes you read that correctly. Dennis Quaid, Martin Short, and Meg Ryan work well together in this entertaining movie.  Short plays a hyper hypocondriac that gets injected with a miniturized sub with Quaid in it.  The results are hilarious.  Both Short and Quaid are in great dynamic comedic form as they deal with there odd circumstances and the enemy agents trying to capture them.  Great writing, excellent cast, decent effects, and good music (Sam Cooke).  All round good movie for the family.

I agree with ""Jeff P"" that it is not geared toward intellectuals. After watching shows like ""Fringe"" that have more science than pseudo, this is a step or two backward but it's not intended to be SCIENCEfiction, it's more like science-fantasy with a little Pixar-Disney type CGI, nothing fancy. It is an original twist on an old tale, an alternate Alice in Wonderland where Wonderland is a human body.  Gives rise perhaps to one serious question (for ""Jeff P"") about the idea that we are all something that lives within something and something/s live within us. Parallel universes exist not just ""out there"" ""through a wormhole"" but inside of us all...answers the age-old question of ""who am I?"" with a different kind of answer.",1373932800,2,902,5.013333333333334

Also, it's directed by one of my favorite filmmakers, Joe Dante ('Gremlins', 'Matinee', 'The Howling', 'Piranha', etc.). An update of the sci-fi classic 'Fantastic Voyage' seems like a perfect fit for Dante, but with the bland and bloated screenplay he had to work with, even a director of Dante's caliber couldn't lift this one out of mediocrity. There are some funny bits, and the old school special effects used to represent the inside of Martin Short's body still look pretty good today (now they would all be done with CGI, of course), but it's still a tough slog to get through the film's two hour running time.",1371686400,,739,4.6923076923076925

880502,5,6304438060,"After ""Explorers"" bombed at the box office in '85, director Joe Dante (Gremlins, The 'burbs) was looking for something more commercial. Peter Guber, who was then working at Warner Bros. after Joe met him at Universal during production on ""The Howling,"" had a treatment for an action movie written by Chip Proser about a spy who gets shrunk down and put inside someone. Joe, when he decided to do it, worked with writer Jeffrey Boam (""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"") and producer Michael Finnell to turn it into a Martin and Lewis movie, where Martin is shrunk down and put inside Jerry.
I just really love this movie. It's frequently cited as one of Dante's best, and it's his only film that won an Oscar (Best Visual Effects, 1987). It takes a little while to get going, but once Martin Short is doing his crazy dance to Sam Cooke's ""Twistin' the Night Away,"" playing on Dennis Quaid's microbe-sized Walkman inside the pod floating around in his thorax somewhere, it's non-stop hilarity. Just how wildly out-of-whack this plot spins is only one of this dangerously clever film's gags. How Quaid and his tiny pod get inside Short, you'll have to see the film to find out.
As far as the disc itself goes, the video and audio quality are excellent. In those departments at least, Warner Home Video has always been kind to their catalog titles. It's in the extras where the disc skimps. Not in quality, mind you, but quantity. There's very little here, but what we do get is excellent. The audio commentary, with Dante, Finnell, visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren and actors Robert Picardo and Kevin McCarthy is both hilarious and informative. Everyone has at least some kind of story to tell, and Picardo gets off a lot of good one-liners, even though he doesn't show up until his character does in the film. There's also a trailer (that uses music from ""The Goonies""--way to go, Warner) and some cast & crew bios. I really shouldn't complain, but this few extras is sure to have a fanboy like me howling. Anyway, the film, tech specs, and what little extras there are are all excellent. There could maybe just be a few more goodies. But remember, ""when things are at their darkest, pal, it's a brave man who can kick back and party.""",1361404800,,2241,4.675949367088608

880996,1,6304438060,"First.  I was dismayed to learn that this movie won an Oscar for best visual effects over Predator.

Second.  It was an inferior remake (some say update) of a much better film: Fantastic Voyage.

Third.  I have to confess that I hated this movie instantly, thanks in part to Dennis Quaid's entrance as Tuck Pendleton (apparently a drunk and a nasty one at that.  It didn't help that a reason for his character's behavior wasn't proffered).  Quaid's portrayal of a run-of-the-mill self avowed jackass hardly made him endearing or sympathetic for what was about to befall his character.  At that point, I couldn't have cared less and almost gave up watching the rest of this movie.  But, I'm stubborn and continued (though I can easily see why this was not a box office success on its original release).  This movie was all over the place, trying to be a Sci-Fi flick, a romance, action thriller, and comedy all at once, not succeeding on any of these levels.  It should have picked a genre and stuck with it.

Fourth.  Martin Short.  I have never appreciated Short's brand of humor and never will so perhaps it was a foregone conclusion that I wouldn't like this movie.  One scene in particular sealed my opinion.  Short's character is on the run from a coterie of villains.  They know about Tuck Pendleton so Short's character ""hides"" out in Tuck's apartment, taking time to get drunk and do the twist!  I know if I was going to hide from killers that's the first thing I do.  Besides shredding credibility, it's also not a funny comic bit: Martin Short cavorting like a 5 year old or a lunatic, take your pick.

Fifth.  It wastes the talents of character actors: Dick Miller, William Schallert, Kathleen Freeman, Henry Gibson, and Kevin McCarthy.

Sixth.  A long long, will it never end, movie: a bloated 120 minutes!

Not a keeper.",1300492800,,1833,4.673981191222571

This also features Meg Ryan as the love interest. It is worth watching the film for Martin Short's (Jack) performance alone, he is a hilarious physical comedian and it is a shame we never saw him in more films of that era (other than in `The Father of the Bride' and a few other low key movies).

As a true testament to Spielberg and the great actors, this movie has aged very little.  If it weren't for the very young Meg Ryan, Dennis Quaid, Martin Short and Robert Picardo, you could say that this movie is a fairly recent release.

The premise is simple.  Dennis Quaid is a test pilot who has been passed up for the space program and instead is picked up by an obscure government program to pilot a submarine that is going to be miniaturized and injected into a rabbit.  He has some personal problems with Meg Ryan and she dumps him.  He gets miniaturized but before he can be injected into the rabbit the bad guys break into the lab to steal the technology that miniaturizes people.  A lab assistant escapes with a minaturized Quaid in his pod in a syringe.  Before he is killed, the assistant injects Quaid into an unsuspecting hypocondriac, Martin Short.  Quaid's pod has the capability to interface with the optic nerve and the eardrum of the person he's injected in so he can ""talk"" to his host and ""see"" what he sees.  And so, begins this wonderful adventure to get Quaid back to normal size by getting the stolen technology back, get Quaid back together with Meg Ryan, to get the bad guys, and to prove that Martin Short is not crazy hearing Quaid in his head.  I won't spoil the movie from there on -- its a great ride.  Oh, I will add that somewhere along the way we bump into Robert Picardo who plays ""The Cowboy,"" a wonderfully memorable performance by Robert Picardo as some kind of technology mercenary -- Picardo commands the silver screen whenever he's on camera --definitely worth watching for just that.

This movie was great back in the 80s and still is a great movie.  Spielberg did a great job making it timeless. The special effects are still good today and Quaid, Short, Meg Ryan, Robert Picardo are great in this movie.

The movie felt very much like a modernized Fantastic Voyage -- being about the inner space (the human body) only with a romantic comedy + action adventure movie mixed in.

This is definitely worth watching -- its an ""A"" Movie from an ""A"" Director with ""A"" Actors.  I will also say that this is a more innocent movie from a more innocent time in moviemaking which is a welcome break from the overly ""cool"" and overly ""sheik"" personas in today's movies.  It is a Fantastic Voyage.  If you grew up in the 80s, you'll love this.

If you're wondering what the feel of this movie is -- its very similar to Back to the Future in terms of flavor with about the same amount of adventure, a dash less comedy and a pinch more romantic comedy.  This movie inspired rides at the major theme parks so it was a major production.  If you have Back to the Future, you need to have Inner Space.",1212278400,4,2852,4.454720616570327

881105,5,6304438060,"A splendid exercise in humourous shrinkage, as mite-sized test-pilot Tuck Pendleton, played by Dennis Quaid, ends up puttering around inside nervous ninny Jack Putter, who is portrayed Martin Short (not seeming quite as short in this film, naturally).  Sealed up and shrunk inside an experimental pod and originally destined for the innards of a rabbit, things go wrong for itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny bellowing micro-dot-sized Tucky when thieves who specialize in boosting radical new high-tech goodies burst into the experimental lab where all the shrinkage is wrapping up, and chase a lone doctor who has the syringe with Tuck tucked in his lab coat all the way to a shopping mall.  And it isn't long after that when Tuck is injected through Short's shorts (assuming he's wearing any) by a panting, dying doc, right into the fat cells of a Short behind.

For me this film works because of all the weird and completely unbelievable stuff that happens that has nothing to do with the shrinkage.  I mean, that is some talented pod Tuck is tucked inside, puttering around Putter!  Tuck can attach remotes to Putter's eye and ear, and see through silly Putter's eye, and be heard by silly Putter's ear.  He can even turn up the volume on Putter's ear enough so that he can hear some Official-types talk about how expendable Putter and Tuck are, assuming they don't get Tuck out of Putter before he runs out of oxygen.  And look:  the onboard computer can adjust to mouse biology (Martin Short IS playing a mouse here, right?...okay, human biology), rather than the pre-planned rabbit schematics for the pre-planned rabbit test.  And best of all!: if Putter has to, let's say, take the place of a shady buyer-and-seller of stolen shrink-tech, Tuck only has to hit a few buttons--and breeze quickly through the Instruction Manual--to alter Putter's face completely...though the procedure is obviously painful, and kind of sickening to look at.

Best of all, Tuck can hitch a ride on a wet kiss between that putz Putter and Tuck's girlfriend Lydia (Meg ""Legs"" Ryan) and switch over to her body for a while (as long as he gets back over to Putter's body when the plot requires it).

That's just what's going on inside Jack Putter.  Then there's all the action as Jack and Lydia fight to get a stolen microchip back from the evil Mr. Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy), his various vicious goons, and the extra-strength vicious Mr. Igoe (big scary actor who's name I don't know), who ends up ""Honey I shrunk the assassin""'d and put inside Putter to eliminate tuckered out Tuck.  They need that chip so they can extract and enlarge Tuck...even though Lydia does seem to be falling for Putter, as he gets braver and braver, in a Heywood Broun/Fifty-First Dragon/""thinks he's drawing on Tuck's bravery, but it's really his own hidden power"" kind of way.

I love the inventiveness of this film; its daring commitment to take the plot anywhere just because they've shrunk a guy and stuck him in Martin Short.  There are some great one-liners--including just a burp--super-duper especially-special FX (that's Special Effects shrunk), and no small or short roles, just small and Short actors, all at their best in this romp.  If, by chance, you have not seen this film, micro-miniaturize--no wait, I mean microwave--the popcorn, and make a little headspace for Innerspace.  Don't you want to see if maybe Dennis Quaid enlarges too early and splatters Martin Short all over everything?

881107,2,6304438060,"I'm a big fan of Joe Dante and I love Martin Short, but 'Innerspace' is just too high on concept and low on just about everything else. You know the tendency for even many great comedies to somehow ""require"" a villian sub-plot? Well 'Innerspace' not only falls victim to that, but the ""on the chase from the bad guy"" scenario propels the film. I guess you could call it ""adventure"", but there's nothing interesting or exciting about it. Short does what he can here and there, but most of it feels like made-for-TV filler material... honestly.

I don't know... Dante is a creative genius, but this is his most lacking IMO. Sure, this is one flick that has brilliant special effects and doesn't ever overplay them, but you almost wish they'd had, because at least something interesting would be happening. 'Gremlins' and 'The 'burbs' had awesomely unique concepts but, by and large, maintained a degree of freshness around them for their running time; 'Innerspace' can't survive for any real length of time.

The concept of the film is great, no doubt, and the actual execution of the fundamental mental/physical relationship between Short and Quaid is pulled off with valor... which is strange, because it's the superficial aspects of the film that fall on their face. I guess that makes sense; Dante is an imaginative nut, and in the face of a drab script and story, he doesn't know what to do.",1163980800,,1394,4.780082987551867
881248,5,6304438060,"""InnerSpace"" is a great sci-fi comedy film with plenty of special effects and interesting ideas. I've seen quite a few times, and it's always good fun to watch.

Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is a scientist, who has volunteered to become a part of an exciting new experiment. Surrounded by a pod of machinery, he will be shrunk down to microscopic size and put inside a rabbit. Unfortunately, the experiment is invaded by mercanaries, who want to sell the new technology to the highest Cold War bidder. A brave scientist, and a good friend of Tuck's, makes a run for it, holding the syringe in which Tuck has been placed. He injects Tuck into a passer by, Jack Putter (Martin Short), a hypercondriac by nature. How will this man react when there's something really wrong with him, when he hears voices broadcast into his ear from inside of him? Will Tuck, with only a limited amount of oxygen, be able to escape? And if he does, will he get back together with his girlfriend (Meg Ryan)?

The special effects really make this film special (pardon the pun). You get to see inside the bloodstream, float above the pumping heart, see the boiling acid of the stomach. I was never that good at biology in high school, but I still found all this really interesting. There are some also some sillier special effects, like people shrunk to half size, and shape changing faces. Everyone plays their part in a pretty 1980s way, which fits perfectly with the pretty 1980s filming. The San Francisco location was a nice touch, and added a bit of colour to the action sequences. The banter between Jack and Tuck, the coaching and the commeraderie between them, is pretty cool in a goofy sort of way. It's all very fascinating to watch when you put it together.

881249,5,6304438060,"Spielberg has been a great entertainer in his career with films like Close Encounters, E.T. and Gremlins. Innerspace is in that line. It is very interesting to rediscover that side of this filmmaker.

Here everything is entertainment and fun, great fun because marvellous humour inhabits every single frame. A little bit of suspense with spies trying to steal this brand new military technology on miniaturization, but the ideological discourse is kind of anecdotic.

The fascination of the film comes from the fact that the camera takes us inside the most intimate functions of a body : blood, heart, stomach with ot without an ulcer (it could be debated), even a pregant uterus, etc. This deep voyage may prompt a claustrophobic reaction but the humor of it will push that reaction aside in no time.

Then we can wonder about the relation between the body and its invader who together manage to encounter and desire the same woman, but the menage a trois is tactfully dealt with thanks to a few benevolent kisses. And it all ends up with more menaces and adventures, with one wedding and one liberation, and the liberated Jack Putter running after the newly wed couple, supposedly to protect them, so he says...

Our life is definitely not a rabbit's life, is it not ?

881251,4,6304438060,"I'm a big fan of this film. BIG fan. It struck a chord with me back in 1987, and I love it to this day.

It's a Joe Dante film, with early performances by Dennis Quaid, Martin Short and Meg Ryan.

It's goofier than all get out; here's the synopsis.

Dennis Quaid is a loose cannon test pilot with a bit of an alcohol problem, who gets ""demoted"" to a secret military program involving miniaturization. He is to be shrunk down, along with a mini-submarine, and injected into a lab rabbit, to test things like the ability to hook up to a host's optic or auditory nerve.

Meg Ryan plays a reporter, romantically involved with Quaid, but for the moment, estranged.

Martin Short plays a hypochondriac supermarket assistant manager.

So, Quaid gets shrunk right before ""the bad guys"" (led by an over-the-top Kevin McCarthy) invade the laboratory, and in his last act as a living person, the escaping lead investigator injects the microscopic Quaid into Short's left buttock.

Hilarity ensues.

I didn't really care much for the whole ""stealing technology"" plot thread (there's a very early role by Robert Picardo), but it's there as a scaffold, just to watch Quaid and Short deal with each other. And that's really a joy to watch.

The one scene in the doctor's office, with Quaid finally patched into Short's inner ear, is hysterical. Short gets to mug opposite old friends (and SCTV alums) Joe Flaherty and Andrea Martin...I've seen it a hundred times yet I still laugh every time.

Yes, there are a lot of clunky lines and bits of extreme over-acting. If you have a problem with either Dennis Quaid or Martin Short, it'll be tough for you to like this movie. Overthink this movie, and you're doing yourself a disservice.

On the other hand, if you like either of those two guys, and are in the mood for a fun romp, this is well worth a viewing. You'll love seeing about a dozen character actors, sprinkled in small roles like Short's doctor, the supermarket manager, Ryan's co-workers...you've seen them in a million movies, and they're perfectly cast here. The 80's fashions and music are an unintentional riot in and of themselves.

They DO up the class level when they selected Sam Cooke songs as the key tunes to the film though.

The DVD looks great...the red Mustang just pops right off the screen. Some of the effects reveal their age (in particular the non-inside-the-body ones), but the scenes inside Martin Short STILL look terrific!

Nice sonics with crisp details.

Depending on your child's exposure to the four-letter word describing excrement (it's used about half a dozen times or so...), this movie is appropriate for a large age range. It's really just a simple lark of a film.

And I still find it to be most enjoyable...",1108857600,45,2737,4.730526315789474
881252,3,6304438060,"I find this movie confusing just as soon as it got going. I don't think I followed the whole miniaturising process properly, as I got completely lost, as soon as the guy getting chased - I didn't realise Dennis Quaid was actually miniaturised and INSIDE that syringe.
When Dennis Quaid (Tuck) was injected into Martin Short's (Jack) body, the whole sections of film dedicated to this reminded me totally of Osmosis Jones (if you haven't seen it, it will give you a hysterical look at the human body).
Before the miniaturising, Tuck comes across as arrogant, and not caring about his girlfriend (played by a very 80s Meg Ryan). But this all changes, and his influence on Jack, also changes him, from an OTT hypochondriac to someone different. One of the funniest scenes is when they both get drunk in Tuck's apartment.
There are also some heartbreaking scenes, particularly when Tuck ends up in Lydia's (Meg Ryan) body, and sees something that effectively makes him changes his life as soon (or if) he gets re-enlarged.
Most of the middle part of the movie is terrific viewing, and although some parts seem to be overly long, it's great. The ending confused me yet again - but you'll have to watch it for yourself to see what I mean won't you?",1088553600,3,1242,4.675799086757991

Instead things go terribly wrong and he winds up injected into a hypochondriac (Martin Short). There's villians of course who are after Short because Quaid has something they want and they know he's inside Short ""that doesn't sound right, lol"".
  I never had any idea Joe Dante (Gremlins) direected this film, now that I know that it's easily my favorite of his films ""yes even over Gremlins"". It's just a fun movie with a nicely written script. Don't get me wrong I know it has it's problems. Mean it's absord  that you're suppose to believe that Quaid can change Short's appearence and make him look like anyone. Meanwhile if he was only suppose to be put inside a rabbit why would that ship he's inside need the option to change appearences. Well this film just shouldn't be taken seriously, it's more enjoyable if you turn if your brain before watching it.
  It's the Short and Quaid team that makes this film so watchable.  When you think about it they aren't even acting together so that makes their work in this even more impressive as you believe they're actually talking to each other. Well anyway Quaid makes the Short character who's wimpy and afraid of everything tougher and gives him the backbone he needs. Innerspace is a fun Science Fiction comedy but also works as a buddy movie and it's actually one of the best ones you'll find. Now all we need is another film by Joe Dante, well as long as it's not Small Soldiers 2.",1041897600,3,1582,4.592198581560283
881254,1,6304438060,"This movie is the most revolting, disgusting, useless film I have ever seen.  The plot, which should be a fun, sci-fi plot, is tedious and implausible.  Not worth seeing for any sci-fi or Dennis Quaid fan.",1041465600,,205,4.666666666666667
881255,4,6304438060,"I thought this was a harmless little comedy version of ""Fantastic Voyage"", quite cute. Pilot Dennis Quaid gets shrunk down to be injected into a rabbit, but goofy Martin Short gets in the way of the hypo. So Quaid has to navigate his way around Short and make up with his girlfriend Meg Ryan at the same time, through Short. But there are nasty evildoers trying to stand in the way of all this getting accomplished, most notably Kevin McCarthy of ""Body Snatchers"" fame from the 1950s. He and his female accomplice also get squirted with some of the miniaturizing stuff, but merely become little midgets battling it out in a car. That was a great silly moment.
Listen to that little voice, and laugh a lot at ""Innerspace"".",1028592000,9,721,4.596899224806202
881316,5,6304438060,"Hey, movie viewers!  If you liked Gremlins, you MUST see this great 1987 film!  It is about a ex-Lieutenant of the U.S. Marines, Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid, Any Given Sunday), who is the subject of a minaturization experiment, which requires 2 microchips.  He gets inside a submersible pod, is minaturized down to a microscopic size, placed in a syringe, and is supposed to be injected into a bunny named BUGS!!  However, a bunch of criminals, disguised as phone repairmen, break into the laboratory and steal one of the chips.  But, a good friend of Tuck's who works at the lab, Ozzie, takes the syringe, runs off, is chased to a mall, and shot.  Fortunately, he lives long enough to run into a nerdy hypochondriac named Jack (Martin Short, Primetime Glick), and injects Tuck into him.  Later on, Tuck finds out he is in a man, then establishes contact with Jack by placing an amplifier in his ear, and attaches a camera to his eye to see what Jack sees, and tells him what is going on and that he only has 'til 9:00 a.m. tomorrow to get out of him before his air supply runs out.  Tuck tells him to go find his girlfriend (Meg Ryan, Hanging Up), and get help from her to recover the chip and save Tuck.  This film is a GREAT sci-fi/comedy, and is from the creators of Gremlins (producer Steven Spielberg and director Joe Dante).  It is also based on the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage.  Like Gremlins, it is also a VERY good family classic.  So, if you liked Gremlins, then you HAVE to see this movie!  It's REAL KOOL!",1028073600,14,1518,4.4763636363636365
881317,3,6304438060,"This movie is not good because it has no story, at least that would have been understandable if it was funny and believe me this movie was not funny.  The reason for the three star rating is that there were a few jokes that were worth laughing at but I think it was still bad.  If you like this type of movie then go buy the DVD but there are plenty of funny movies to buy.",1027468800,2,373,3.8947368421052633
881318,5,6304438060,"Innerspace has always been one of my all-time favorite movies, so I was excited to find out it would be released on DVD.  Perhaps the best part of the DVD is the excellent digital transfer they did.  The movie was originally released in 1986, but it looks and sounds brand new on the DVD.  You can see and hear things you couldn't before, an example being the deep bass of Putter's heartbeat during the scenes taking place inside of him.  If you are a fan of this movie and have a DVD player, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  You will not be disappointed!",1026345600,,561,4.254716981132075
881319,4,6304438060,"I found Innerspace quiet fascinating and interesting to watch, with all the cool and unique special effects that blew my mind away! This film also stars Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan.  And my favorite actor--Martin Short! His performance was great.  This film tells a story of a scitentist whose dreams get all twisted around, all because of one man's screwed up brain.  He's clumsy and just plain not human, if ya know what I mean! Ever thing he does goes wrong, which makes it funny.  When Dennis Quaid's character makes an attempt to create a syndrom to make his dream of going inside a rabbit's blood stream, it accidently gets turned around when an intruder steals the shot and injects it into Martin Short's character.  The thing that I liked about Innerspace, is that we could actually see what was going in through Short's body.  Amazing special effects, if you ask me.  I liked this flick a lot, and without Martin Short, this film wouldn't be as half as hilarious as it was! Innerspace rocks!",1017619200,,998,4.668571428571428

Quaid plays Tuck Pendelton, a shrunken test pilot who
was suppose to be injected into a rabbit,but after an
attack by a group of people who are trying to reach the
same achievement of shrinking is instead injected into Jack Putter (Martin Short) a meek, hypochondriac who works at
safeway. Now Tuck and Jack along with Tuck's old girlfriend
Lidia (Meg Ryan) must fight to get Tuck back to normal.  There's
a big surprise too.
This movie contains awesome visual effcts (which it
won an academy award for), terffic action, and witty
comical jokes and phases.  This movie's a real winner.",1017187200,7,635,4.702702702702703

881323,4,6304438060,"Besides particular types of fashion, music, and television, the 1980s also contained its own unique movies. In a typical 80's movie (whether it be comedy, action, or drama) there is the roguish, dashing young man who is the film's hero. The hero is down on his luck, is in trouble with his girl, and is forced (usually out of necessity) into the most dangerous mission of his life. The hero has become an anti-hero and he hates it. He sees no way out but to do what he does best. However, something bad happens and the hero finds himself in a jam where he can't save himself. Ironically, he has to rely on a bumbling fool to come to his rescue. In doing so, the fool rises above himself, becoming a hero in the process. The plot is as old as time and Shakespeare used it over and over. Nevertheless, it wasn't until the 1980s that American moviemakers really delved into this age-old concept.

In this regards, INNERSPACE is a typical 80's movie. You have the fallen hero (Dennis Quaid), his estranged love (Meg Ryan), and the fool that saves them both (Martin Short). There is also the usual dash of bad 80's clothing and techno rhythms. However, INNERSPACE is not a typical 80's movie. Much of the plot is taken from the sci-fi classic, THE FANTASTIC VOYAGE. However, INNERSPACE takes the idea from that movie to a whole new level. Not only that, but INNERSPACE is an action-comedy, with a little bit a romance tied it. There are a ton of movies that try to pull a combination like that off, but very few are as succesful at it as INNERSPACE.",985651200,,1544,4.475177304964539
