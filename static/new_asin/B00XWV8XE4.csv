8716968,5,B00XWV8XE4,"I like that it was 5.1 surround. I do prefer 16:9 but when it is 5.1 and 2.35 I know it is an exact replica of the theater production thus getting everything that I am supposed to get. I liked the violence. There was plenty of shooting, punching and kicking. I liked the story. This is the kind of movie I want when I decide to watch another movie.",1505692800,,348,4.057971014492754

8716970,2,B00XWV8XE4,"John Doe (Vinnie Jones) wants to kill Sonny 'Sundown' Garcia (Michael Rene Walton) for personal reasons. He appears to have unlimited resources after spending 20 years in a Mexican prison. Sonny gets killed early in the film and then the rest is told as flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks making the time line a bit confusing with all the ""one week earlier"" signs that introduce every new segment.

The plot weaves itself with flashbacks up until the twist ending which is narrated to us. There were too many action scenes that were boring. Vinnie Jones, our head liner, spends the entire action film sitting in the drivers seat of a car talking to people, hiring them to do specific jobs leading up to the twist which was anti-climatic because of the narration.

Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. No nudity.",1438992000,,809,4.855072463768116
8716971,2,B00XWV8XE4,"Disappointed in this one.  I thought the actors were going to bring it home, but they faded into the challenged story line. Lack of chemistry between the characters were also prevalent.",1438992000,,185,4.967741935483871
8716972,1,B00XWV8XE4,"I love these types of movies but this one is so boring and poorly acted it's more enjoyable to watch the wind blow, absolutely terrible acting at all levels, with every male character.  Females not much better.  terrible story that goes backwards from the end, zero good action scenes that don't belong in a high school movie class edit.  Save your money, save you time. this isn't even worth watching for free.",1438732800,,411,4.680555555555555
