503831,3,6302730023,"I bought this videotape because I like boxing and heard this movie was one of the best boxing movies ever made along with ""Raging Bull"". The movie was pretty good but lacks the artistic depth of ""Raging Bull"". In fact, the movie really isn't even about boxing but is a straight morality play. The boxing is incidential. In the movie, the characters are either good or bad, with little grey, except for the Garfield character. Of course, good triumphs and the hero gets the girl. This makes the film a little boring on both an intellectual and emotional level. Anyone more interested in boxing, and being challenged intellectually and emotionally, is better off with ""Raging Bull"".",1018224000,2,680,4.870689655172414
503832,5,6302730023,"""Body and Soul"" was the pride and joy of Enterprise Productions, an independent company located just off Melrose Avenue near RKO and Paramount.  It was dedicated to developing productions for its superstar, John Garfield.  This is a morality play in which New Yorker Garfield, playing a role not unlike his own life, rises above temptation, reclaims his respectability, and bows out his professional boxing career as winner and still champion.
After his father is killed, an accidental victim of a turf war involving New York gangland elements, Garfield turns to the world of professional boxing despite his mother Ann Revere's admonitions against it.  His mind is made up after a government official shows up at their apartment to ask Revere questions concerning going on relief, or in today's parlance, welfare.  Garfield finds the process dehumanizing, evicts the government worker, and enters the professional boxing realm, aided by the area's noted boxing manager, William Conrad.
Eventually Garfield hits the big time and wins the world championship, but sells his soul in a Faustian bargain to unscrupulous promoter Lloyd Gough.  In the process his decent, highly ethical girlfriend Lillie Palmer drops him, saying she will not deal with him as long as the unsavory Gough guides his destiny.  After that he takes up with opportunistic night club singer Hazel Brooks, who lives for luxury in the fast lane.
Gough hits his lowest point when matching Garfield with the talented and popular champion Canada Lee, whose manager beseeches him to quit due to brain damage.  One more extra hard blow can do the champion in, he has been warned by doctors.  Gough explains that Lee need not worry, and that he will tell Garfield that he should carry him and not land any hard blows.  He then purposely neglects to tell Garfield, with Lee almost losing his life in the process.  Garfield, feeling terrible, then gives Lee a job as a trainer.
Eventually Gough decides that it is Garfield's turn to lose to the up and coming young contender from Texas.  Garfield is pressured to accept the dive.  He even bets his entire purse on his challenger.
The championship bout is so boring that fans boo and taunt.  Garfield pulls his punches and spends much time clinching.  Then, in the next to last round, Gough initiates his doublecross by giving the go ahead to the challenger to use full strength on Garfield as he pummels the surprised champion and knocks him down.
""I'll kill him, I'll kill him,"" Garfield promises.  By the time the round ends he has cleared his head.  In the final round he devastates the challenger, knocks him out, and receives a standing ovation.  He wins Palmer back and rejects an advance from Brooks.
When Gough tells Garfield afterwards that he has run a great risk in crossing him, the champion coolly replies, ""What are you gonna do, kill me?  Remember what you told me, 'Everybody dies.'""
James Wong Howe's photography of the fight scenes were staggeringly real.  He did them while on roller skates, enabling him to keep up with the flow of action.
Director Robert Rossen and screenplay author Abraham Polonsky had a difference of opinion on the film's ending for awhile.  Rossen, favoring a more realistic ending befitting a fighter who has crossed a major mob figure, shot a sequence of Garfield walking down a dark New York street, being gunned down, then shoved into a garbage can to serve as an example to anyone who dared cross the mob.  Polonsky favored the ending that was ultimately used as Rossen told him after viewing both endings, ""You were right.  Your ending is better.""
Enterprise made one more great film, with Polonsky adapting his own script and making his directorial debut in ""Force of Evil,"" with Garfield playing a mob lawyer who reforms.",1011657600,14,3781,4.921259842519685
503833,4,6302730023,"Body and Soul is a gripping tale about one of the most corrupt sports, both now and then: boxing.  As we watch ""the Champ"" emerge from poverty, aching to hit the big time, we understand why he would make a Faustian bargain with the sleazy big-time boxing promoter.  The Champ figures he'll be smart and shrewd enough to be the one pulling the strings, but of course he is deluded, and when the promoter tells him to lose a big fight, the Champ finally has to wrestle with his conscience.  The big fight is the movie's spectacular climax.
My two main complaints are that the Champ's girlfriend Peg (played by Lilli Palmer) is a stock character: the wholesome girl who tries to guide her boyfriend down the right path and waits like an angel, ready to forgive all, for her wayward boyfriend to return to her fold.  Also, the ending is a cop-out.  PLOT SPOILER TO FOLLOW.  While it is inspiring to see the Champ refuse to throw the fight, we know that as a result the promoter probably will try to kill him, so the happy ending as the Champ and Peg walk off in each other's arms after the big fight is premature.  The point of the film is that the Champ's reckless actions had gotten himself into a no-win situation: either he would throw the fight and lose his integrity or he would not throw the fight and would lose his life.  The film's happy ending covers over that tragedy and dilutes the moral of the story.",1011571200,3,1411,4.4
503834,4,6302730023,"Produced in 1947, this film received three Oscar ominations.  It's a story  of a fighter who gets drawn into the corruption of the boxing world.  John Garfield does an excellent job in the role, which, I understand, parallels some of his own early life growing up on the streets of New York.  Lilli Palmer, cast as his ""nice"" girlfriend does a good job too.  But Hazel Brooks, his sultry gold digger girlfriend seems to be overacting the whole time.  And his mother, played by Anne Revere, doesn't come across as Jewish, which is what the role calls for.  But yet, the film moved quickly and held my interest throughout and the tension was there the whole time.  Will he or won't he throw the fight?  It's not until the very end, after a scene using the best film editing and cinematography available at the time, that we finally find out.  I also like the song ""Body and Soul"" which was played in the background throughout and I found myself humming the tune all the next day.  This is a tight, well-done video, and certainly worth seeing.  I do recommend it. I just stop short though of rating it a #5.",1010534400,3,1104,4.465
503835,5,6302730023,"Body and Soul gets my vote as the best boxing film ever.  This dark film noir masterpiece is still hard hitting (If somewhat dated)in the new millenium.  Abraham Polonsky hit his zenith with this one as did Robert Rossen, and James Wong Howe's innovative photography (He filmed the fight scenes in the ring by wearing roolerskates with a camera attached to his chest) has yet to be equaled for it's graphic realism.  However, it is John Garfield's riveting and desperate performance as The Champ pressured by mobsters to take a dive that is the real gem in this one.  I feel that this was Garfield's finest ever characterization, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Charlie Davis.  Garfield's dark and brooding, rugged good looks are magnified ever the more so by Howe, and he physically looked the part of the prizefighter.  The close up shots of the star are outstanding.  The film is edited brilliantly, and the life and death battle at the film's climax is particularly brutal and exciting.  If your'e a boxing and movie fan- This one is a ""Can't Miss"".  The tough guy ghetto riser played by Garfield is so convincingly portrayed because it somewhat mirrored his real-life circumstances and upbringing.  Five Big Stars!",994723200,7,1250,4.85377358490566
503836,5,6302730023,"No movie actor inflects lines from the script better than John Garfield. That  plus a flawlessly staccato delivery, which cuts through dialogue like a buzz saw, distinguish his tough guy performances. These abilities are on superb display in this boxing melodrama, one of the liveliest on that sinister sport. The best parts are those dealing with the struggle for Davis's (Garfield) soul, with Lloyd Goff's super-slick fight fixer as Satan. It's the classic contest pitting money against virtue, and while Davis is quick to grasp the rules of the ring, he's slow to understand the price he is paying. Not exactly cutting-edge material, but slickly and memorably done. The weakest parts are a seemingly miscast Lilli Palmer, a shade too refined to be believable, and Ann Revere's hair that looks like a flour-spraying crop duster gave it a quick pass. The film contains one truly memorable scene, when the washed-up black fighter, Canada Lee, at last confronts his tormentors. It's an emotion packed opportunity that really reaches gut-level. I guess the reason so many from cast and crew were later blacklisted is because of the film's communist inspired message -- that money is not the most important value in life. Good thing those investigators never got around to the religious community.",993772800,3,1294,5.132701421800948
503837,5,6302730023,"John Garfield offers one of his most memorable roles in this thrilling boxing expose.  He's up and coming fighter Charley Davis, a tough kid being pulled in opposite directions by his family and by the local mob kingpin.  Academy Award-nominated script from Abe Polonsky (who'd collaborate with  Garfield again in ""Force of Evil""), the directorial debut of  Robert Rossen, and the usual stellar photography from super-D.P.

She, an unknown artist and he, an up and coming small time fighter whose only matches thus far have been in the neighborhood rings poverty and small time crooks dictate. When his father is accidentally killed Charley begins to fight for real money so can support his mother, amply played by the wonderful character actress, Anne Revere, who abhors fighting. Up from the streets of New York comes a winning boxer to whom money means more than anything else in the world. Fight after fight sees Charley becoming wealthier yet more and more ensnared in the trap laid for him by a big time promoter who plays for large stakes and who arranges bets, wins and losses within the ring! In the end, Charley must make the decision his career, his entire future and his integrity hinges on. Great performances by Garfield and the entire cast.

 Anne Revere, in her usual flawless interpretation, sparkles as the mother who knows her son all too well",1399334400,,1067,4.664893617021277
503977,5,6302730023,"Every October, the American Film Institute and the Film Noir Foundation sponsor ""Noir City DC"", a festival of film noir at a large restored art deco theater. This year's festival opened with ""Body and Soul"", a classic 1947 boxing film, preceded by an introduction by the noir scholar Foster Hirsch.

""Body and Soul"" stars the character actor John Garfield (1913 --  1952) as the ambitious young Jewish boxer, Charlie Davis. Garfield received an Academy Award nomination for his performance in this movie. The movie received two Academy Awards for the best original screenplay (Abraham Polonsky) and for film editing (James Wong Howe). Many of the principals in the movie, including Garfield and Polonsky, became victims of Hollywood blacklisting.  When it was released, the movie presented a strong political message about the corruption and greed which, the script suggests, pervades American capitalism.  The movie works on many levels separate from any political overtones.

Most of the story is told as a lengthy flashback as Charlie wrestles with his past and his conscience the evening before a highly-anticipated 15 round title fight with a flashy young boxer, Dave Davis (Art Smith). Set in New York City's Lower East Side during the Depression, the film through Charlie's eyes describes his rise from the amateur ranks of the slums to the world championship. Charlie's parents run a candy shop, and his mother wants Charlie to learn a profession and give up boxing. But Charlie is both committed to boxing and, not surprisingly, has his eyes on the money. Charlie wants to marry and provide financial stability for his sweetheart, a young European-educated artist named Peg Born (Lilli Palmer).

Charlie quickly becomes emeshed in the crooked world of professional boxing dominated by a criminal promoter, Roberts (Lloyd Gough). As the movie progresses, Charlie advances through the ranks of boxing, earns and squanders a great deal of money, alienates his friends, and is on the verge of losing entirely his self-respect.

The climactic scene of the movie, both in terms of plot and filming, comes after Charlie's long meditation about his past in the brutal portrayal of the 15 round championship fight between Charlie and Davis.  The movie captures the fight and the spectators in all their rawness, crudeness, and violence. It may still constitute one of the best boxing scenes ever filmed.

The movie features strong acting performances, particularly by Garfield, and gritty portrayals of New York City's underside. It captures the streets and impoverished people of the old Lower East Side and the hard, cruel world of professional boxing. This was a gripping movie. I was grateful for the opportunity of getting to know the film at last on a large screen as part of the 2013 Film Noir Festival.

503983,5,6302730023,"... he, Charley (played by John Garfield and his blues) he, was from hunger, was from hunger  like a lot of guys, guys from East America, working class guys  with small town hungers (and small dreams too) from places like North Adamsville,  Olde Saco, and Waterville, except his hunger (and dream) was magnified by being near, Lower East Side Jewish tenement cold water flat where- is- the- next- pay- check- coming- from to ante up the rent and feed hungry (food hungry) kids near, the great white lights of New York City high life. Yah, he had the hunger bad, and the dream bad too, the 1930s jewish/hillbilly/polish/irish/downeast swamp yankee /french-canadian, name your ethnic group, dream of jailbreak from close quarters, from family necktie, from corner boy nickel and dime stuff, stuff beyond just getting by and being some soda jerk job serving egg creams, seltzer, two cents plain, and penny candy (milky ways,  mary jane ,no, not that mary jane, tootsie rolls, milk duds, the fare of the Saturday matinee), to hurrying no time dream kids. And see, he had it figured, maybe not every way figured but a good part figured and he would ad lib, play by ear, play by luck the rest of it. Why? Well he had the fastest hands around, fastest fighting hands, boxing hands (other fast hands, fast girl hands too, but that's for later) everybody said so. No jewish shy boy, some Talmudic intellectual, no goof, not yarmulke thrown on the ground by some rough-hewn heathen irish christ-believers victim he. Yah, he could throw a punch, take some too, and he had heart, a big immense sad sack heart.

But there were a million guys with fast hands, who could take a punch, and had plenty of heart in those hungry days so what was needed was a break, a timely break and that is what our boy Charley got, got with some very long strings attached.  He became a prize fighter, a practitioner of the manly arts, a pug in front of large crowds. You know though that anything from cockroaches to rabbits to dogs to horses to human flesh that can be bet on comes attached with very long strings. And so Charley sold himself to the devil, or better to the man, to the connected man, the juice man. Grabbed that front dough, grabbed the deal, grabbed the out form hunger deal, with both hands. And because he had those fast hands that turned out to be just a bit faster than a lot of other guys with heart (some with real heart others, like in a lot of things, just looking for a big payday and so could be fast or slow on demand) he prospered, for a while. He got to see those bright white lights of New York City, real New York City, up close, until the other hand dropped and the day came when he too had to decide whether he could be slow or fast on demand. And in the end he was fast but not without about sixteen sweaty moments, and twenty hesitations. Yah, our boy Charley had all the heart in the whole wide world at the end and so guys from Podunk towns in East America (those dreaming hard-scrabble wide open field okies and arkies heading west to pick the crops would not have comprehended what was happening in the closed quarters East America) could cheer him on, cinematically anyway.

Oh yah, I said I would speak of those Charley other fast hands. Hell, a guy can't go up in front of the bright lights alone, he needs something soft for those long nights in between bouts, sometime to be the toast of the town with. So Peg (played by Lili Palmer), a Village painter (if you need to ask what village just keep moving on) if you could figure such a clever gal going for a pug, no matter how fast his hands and his good looks, volunteered to be his sweetie. But see Peg has scrupled, big scruples about fighting, fixes, and giving friends (and your dear widowed mother as well) the short end of the stick on your way up and so for a very long time she held him at arms' length as he was blinded by the bright lights. Of course a champ, a champ of anything, with dough, with connections, and  with a newfound  taste for the wild side, and not afraid to pay for those thrills will not have to stand lonely and cold out on Fifth Avenue very long before some twist, Alice (played by Hazel Brooks) some lovely low bar chanteuse  femme fatale, second class, drifts by. Frankly I would have played that frail out, that fast-spending Alice, played her out to the end, but that would have destroyed the uplift story line. If she is not doing anything tonight I could show her some fast hands. We'll just let Charley and Peg fade into some Jersey bungalow with a couple of kids and a dog sunset.",1357862400,,4585,4.415384615384616

504016,4,6302730023,"If your a fan of John Garfield like I am then Christmas came early this year when Olive Films released two of his classic films on blu ray this week(July 31). ""Body and Soul""(1947) is probably his most famous film and he deserved his only Oscar Nomination for Best Actor for his performance. Boxing has been a subject matter for films for many years going all the way back to ""The Champ""(1931) in which Wallace Beery won an Oscar for Best Actor and all the way to ""Raging Bull""(1980) which brought Robert DeNiro a Best Actor Oscar also. In between there was not only ""Body and Soul"" but ""Champion""(1949) with Kirk Douglas and also ""Rocky""(1976) with Sylvester Stallone which became a franchise. Those of you who bought or owned the regular DVD of ""Body and Soul"" from Republic should be very pleased with this new blu ray transfer. An independant production originally released thru United Artists the print appears to be from a fine grain master postive but not the original negative. The reason I say that is because there's still a lot of grain and specks in some of the scenes but the close ups are crystal clear. Except for some of the fight scenes and some transition shots, James Wong Howe's beautiful cinematography looks great on blu ray. All the performances are top notch, including not only Garfield but the supporting players as well. Anne Revere, Canada Lee, Lloyd Gough, William Conrad, and Lilli Palmer all give fine performances. Sadly, except for Conrad and Palmer, most of the principles were blacklisted a few years later, including the screenwriter Abraham Polondky who directed Garfield the following year in ""Force of Evil"". Once again it's the writing and authentic dialogue that makes this picture. The scenes between Canada Lee and John Garfield are very touching. Friends in real life the stess from their blacklisting probably contributed to their early deaths. Ironically, they both died within ten days of each other in May, 1952. Lee was 45 and Garfield only 39. It was a sad double loss for all of us fans of these two remarkable human beings. This year marks the 60th Anniversery of John Garfield untimely death and Olive Films is doing him justice by releasing ""Body and Soul"" and ""Force of Evil"" on blu ray. Hopfully with Warner Home Video releasing ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in October, this great actor will get re-discovered by a whole new generation of fans.",1344038400,5,2404,4.823244552058111
504017,5,6302730023,"United Artists  presents ""BODY AND SOUL"" (9 November 1947) (104 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- The fight film to which all others are compared. John Garfield portrays Charlie Davis, a Jewish prizefighter whose parents want him to hang up the gloves and get an education --- When his father is killed in a bomb explosion, however, the proud Charlie prevents his mother (Anne Revere) from accepting government relief, turns pro, and by hook and crook, rises quickly to the top, winning the championship from Ben (onetime welterweight Canada Lee), who is left with a life-threatening blood clot in his brain --- As the champ, Charlie slides into a dissipated lifestyle and throws over his artist girlfriend, Peg Born (Lilli Palmer), for a floozy (Hazel Brooks), falling deeper into the clutches of the gangster who owns him (Lloyd Goff) in the process.

The results are not unexpected but highly satisfying --- When Davis leaves the ring he's threatened again by his mob handler.

""Get yourself a new boy. I retire.""
""What makes you think you can get away with this?""
""What are you gonna do? Kill me? Everybody dies.""

Garfield's riveting, Oscar-nominated performance lifts this film to the masterpiece level, as do Robert Rossen's superb direction, the marvelous photography of James Wong Howe and the Oscar-winning editing --- The fight sequences, in particular, brought a kind of realism to the genre that had never before existed (Howe wore skates and rolled around the ring shooting the fight scenes with a hand-held camera) --- A knockout on all levels.

504021,4,6302730023,"I looked at this as simply a good story, a solid drama that happened to have the sport of boxing figure into it.

""Boxing movies"" - if people insist on labeling this under that category - were particularly popular around the time of this film. Many of them had similar stories about a good guy being told to take a dive ""or else."" Yes, that was in here, too, but it wasn't anywhere near the central part of the story. This film was more of an earlier ""Raging Bull""-type tale in that it concentrated on the friends, family, freeloaders, criminals and women surrounding the main male character.

Here, we have a story about a decent man who gets carried away with success and with the power and money that goes with it. As good as the lead actor, John Garfield, was in here - and he was good - I was more intrigued with the supporting characters.

Lilli Palmer looked and sounded the part of a refined sweet, pretty lady and was a good contrast to the uneducated and quick-tempered brute (Garfield). As in so many stories, she wasn't fully appreciated by her man until the end. Anne Revere, as Garfield's mom was fascinating as she always was and kudos to Joseph Peveny as ""Shorty"" and Lloyd Gough a ""Roberts."" Both added a lot to the film. Wlliam Conrad and Hazel Brooks added some great film noir-type dialog, berating each other once in a while.

These actors, and the photography of James Wong Howe, now on a nice DVD transfer, make this a cut above most if not all the so-called ""boxing films.""",1233100800,,1497,4.472527472527473
504022,5,6302730023,"One of the best boxing movies ever.  Based on the early life of Barney Ross who became a champion for 5 years in three divisions, Ross won 72 fights.  Ross also became a WWII war hero in later life.

This movie is worth the watch, John Garfield does a great job as does Lili Palmer and several of the character actors that you may recognize.  The early years are very similar to those of Barney Ross, if you like boxing and you like the people who struggle from the bottom to the top, this is for you.",1232409600,,501,4.134020618556701
504023,4,6302730023,"You don't have to like boxing to like this movie.  I hate boxing and I wasn't sure I'd even sit through this film but I pulled it off the library shelf because I'd seen practically everything else there.  I was really surprised that that film grabbed my attention and, during the last, dramatic, fight scene I was practically sitting on the edge of my seat!

There's nothing very surprising about the story---you know from the get-go what's going to happen but it was so well done that it was really worth sitting through to the end.  The performance of Garfield is what engages you.  He's very endearing and likable even when he makes some bad choices.  When I read on the DVD cover that he was paired up with Lili Palmer, I was amazed...thought they were a highly unlikely couple.  But somehow it worked---opposites attract and their chemistry was great.  She is very beautiful here and her sweetness comes through much more than in some of her more sophisticated later roles.  (Although I confess it's been a long time since I've seen her in anything else.)

The rest of the characters are stock types but still so well played that you don't mind.  Many of the films of this type don't hold up with age, but this one really does, mostly because of Garfield's performance, I think.  How tragic that the stress of making it contributed to his early heart attack and death.

The song, Body and Soul is so good--it really captures the passion of the film.  I'm tempted to give this five stars.",1228694400,,1492,4.581132075471698
504024,4,6302730023,"Body and Soul isn't the great fight movie - the first half of the movie is often too conventional and formulaic for that - but it's certainly a contender even if it loses the title to The Set-Up. It's certainly one of John Garfield's best roles, finally getting into the ring: the play Golden Boy had been written for him only for the producers to cast him in a supporting role instead, so there's an element of unfinished business here, though Abraham Polonsky's script is much better that Odets' rather patronising fairytale. Where Odets dealt in stereotypes, Polonsky and everyone else on the film treat the supporting characters with dignity and respect: at a time when Stepinfetchit was the image of big screen black America, Canada Lee's performance as the former champ is a revelation - he may not have much screen time, but he's one of the most clued-in characters in the piece, with a dignity and intelligence all but unheard of for a black character in the 40s.

Despite the odd line like ""If you wanna fight, fight for something, not for money,"" it's not an overtly political film, though that didn't stop it being used as evidence of communist subversion in the McCarthy era: few films can have had so many of its cast and crew blacklisted. Indeed, the HUAC must have used the credits as a wishlist - Polonsky, Garfield, Ann Revere, Lloyd Gough, Canada Lee, Art Smith, Shimen Ruskin, producer Bob Roberts and even, albeit to a lesser extent, cinematographer James Wong Howe (who had originally wanted to be a prizefighter and famously shot the bouts on rollerskates to get a more fluid sense of motion) all found themselves either blacklisted or greylisted, while director Robert Rossen only avoided that fate by naming names. Some weren't even communists (although most were members of minority groups). It's actually horrifying to consider just how many people involved in the film, from top to bottom, had their careers ruined or even, in the case of Garfield and Lee, were driven to an early death. In retrospect, the famed great almost-last line ""What ya gonna do, kill me? Everybody dies."" takes on a particularly bitter resonance.

[Aside from several future blacklist victims, it also boasts three future directors among its credits (Robert Aldrich, Robert Parrish and Nathan Juran) as well as montages from a fourth, Gunther Von Fritsch, whose directorial career never recovered from being fired from Curse of the Cat People].",1200614400,2,2447,4.9225181598062955

A man in a rural area gets into a car and drives to a city. Charley Davis is a boxer, and he visits his mother. Peggy is not happy to see him. There will be a fight the next day. Charley was told to make the fight last 15 rounds. The bets are all in. Then Charley recalls his past life, when he first met Peg, a model and painter. Charley's parents did not approve of prizefighters. Some gang attacks a neighboring speakeasy, there is collateral damage at his parent's candy store. The story shows the hard times for ordinary people. Charley's Mom wants to get a loan so Charley can get an education, but Charley refuses. Charley will fight to make big money. But Mr. Roberts controls the fight game in New York.

After a year Charley is near the top. He has a lot of money now, and drinks. Mr. Roberts demands that Ben, injured in his last bout, fight Charley. Mr. Roberts also makes a new deal to split the winnings. In the fight Charley knocks out Ben, the champ. At the celebration party some facts come out, and Shorty leaves them. Peg decides she doesn't want that life. Charley continues with his good times. Then a new challenger appears. The deal is for Charley to go 15 rounds for a decision (the fix is in). A big fix like this is a lush opportunity in a lifetime. Charley thinks of ending his career, this will be his last fight.

But there is a complication in his life. Ben the trainer had stayed in the fight game too long. The title fight goes on. Charley isn't doing so well, he is knocked down but saved by the bell. Charley does worse in the next round. There is a KO in the last round, Charley pulled off a victory!

504057,2,6302730023,"Don't let the stars fool you, I love this movie and if I were reviewing the movie itself on its merits alone, it would get 6 stars.  My love for this classic is the reason I can give this DVD version only two stars.  The print is very poor - the lighting in some scenes is too dark to pick up some details.  There are skips and jumps in the frame.  The sound transfer is also very uneven.  In fact my 20 year-old VHS tape is STILL better quality than this DVD.  But all those technical faults could be forgiven were it not for the most egregious cut of all - a few lines of dialogue.  In a pivotal scene where the grocer delivers to the Davis house, Charley has just told Peg that he needs his money to bet on the fight.  The grocer comes in and talks about everyone betting on the fight - Charley says anyone who bets is foolish.  The grocer disagrees.  The words that were cut out of this print, essentially the heart of why the neighborhood loves their champ, are very simple ""In Europe, the Nazis are killing our people, but here Charley is Champeen!  No, it's not about the money.""  I have no idea why these lines are missing, but it was the final straw before I returned the DVD for a refund.

Unfortunately us movie fans lose out again.  We can't get a decent transfer or an unedited copy of a great film.  Many lesser films released in the last 5 years have several editions available, with added footage, interviews, alternate endings, ""director's"" cuts and other gimmicks to drive sales.  It's a good thing I haven't given away my VHS tape or dumped my VCR, otherwise I'd never again see this movie in a facsimile of its intended presentation.

504058,5,6302730023,"The quintessential fight movie, starring John Garfield as the boxer who works his way up to becoming the champ, but sells his soul (and body) to sleezy promoters along the way. He does whatever they tell him to do, as long as he gets his money. In his last fight he's supposed to take a dive so a new champ can be crowned (Garfield even bets against himself), but at the last minute he gains his self-respect and wins the bout.

As a boxing movie there is the usual fare offered up: corruption, sleezebag fights, money grubbing - but the cast does a superb job all around and makes the picture top-notch entertainment. The whole movie has an uncommon sense of realism about it. Lili Palmer as Garfield's true love and Anne Revere as his mother are real standouts. The scenes with black actor Canada Lee (who was also a professional fighter) are also on the level for once. The script is excellent, and the photography, especially of the fight scenes, is eye-popping. And, of course, the haunting theme song occurs throughout the movie, to great effect.

504059,5,6302730023,"With the arguable exeption of ""Rocky""  and ""Raging Bull""  BAS is the greatest boxing film of all time -- perhaps one of the greatest films of any kind.  To a young viewer, it may seem riddled with cliche's, (which is part of the fun) but realize, BAS was the prototype for such cliche's.  It literally wrote the book of using boxing as a metaphor of the struggle of life itself .  The depiction of the sleezy promoter, the allure of money and fame,  the glorification of violence, the betrayal of those who are no longer useful,  and the ultimate fall from grace caused  by the cruelest of enemies -- age.  It's all here.  It's the most basic of morality tales -- everybody loves a winner, but nobody stays a winner for long.  And  in a touch of blue collar existentialism, the most profound statement of all reverberatates throughout -- ""everybody dies"".  This was the role Garfield was meant to play. A combination of tough guy swagger with a touch of self doubt.  Garfield also insisted on a scene (often cut out on television presentations) where the characters address the fact that "" people like us are being persecuted in Germany.""  This was heavy stuff for Hollywood to handle at the time, and it makes its point more powerfully than a 3 hour documentary on the holocaust.  The final fight scene is devestatingly gritty. But throughout the entire film there isn't a false step in the direction or the performances and even the score is magnificant.  (People who thought Million Dollar baby was a masterpiece, take note...THIS is the way it's supposed to be done).  But what I think is the  most powerful aspect of this film is also what is most misunderstood.  The ending of BAS is often viewed as an act of redemption, when it is not.  It is an act of SPITE.  (Stop here if you don't want to know the ending)  Charlie fights to win not for glory or out of a sense of duty. But because he's been betrayed and would rather lose it all that to let the ""evil"" prosper at his expense. That is humbris times ten!  And that is the action of a pure, unadulterated,prideful, arrogent, politically incorrect, ""don't let them make a monkey out of you""  American man from the middle of the 20th century -- the kind they don't make anymore.  As is this movie.  It's a must. Enjoy.",1128211200,3,2276,4.514705882352941
504060,5,6302730023,"This review is for the 1999 Artisan/Republic Pictures DVD release.

Some consider Body and Soul the best boxing movie ever.  It's a great movie, but to me it's more about a boxer who faces greater challenges outside the boxing ring than inside.  John Garfield stars as Charley Davis, a street-wise New Yorker who moves up fast in the boxing world.  Along the way he meets a beautiful, well-educated woman named Peg (played by Lilli Palmer) and they fall in love, but his boxing career creates obstacles for their relationship as well as Charley's other friends, family and business associates.

The challenges, conflicts and temptations this pugilist encounters outside that ring is what makes this movie so special.  The toughest challenge is with Charley's promoter, Mr. Roberts (Lloyd Gough) who in effect ""owns"" Charlie and the film exposes the dark side of professional boxing that even seems relevant today.  It's a sobering reminder that professional sports is more about money than competition, and athletics can be expendable or exploited for selfish gain.

The DVD released by Artisan is a disappointment.  The video transfer was not restored and small specs of film deterioration are frequently seen throughout the entire movie.  There are even several abrupt jumps in the movie, probably due to the film being spliced where it had once broken.  The audio portion is also noisy and could have been cleaned up too.  A small independent studio that is now defunct called Enterprise originally made this film.  This movie is a classic and it's a shame that a major studio like Warner Brothers hasn't picked up the rights to release a fully restored version.

504061,5,6302730023,"When actor John Garfield wanted to make a boxing movie, Abraham Polonsky came up with this story on the spur of the moment. ""Body and Soul"" found great popular success and went on to garner Garfield an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, Polonsky a nod for Best Screenplay, and win the 1948 Oscar for Best Editing. In addition to being one of John Garfield's most popular roles, ""Body and Soul"" is remembered for its realistic depiction of boxing matches, filmed by cinematographer James Wong Howe, who had been a professional boxer in his youth. It probably didn't hurt that John Garfield had been an amateur boxer when he was young also, although he had to be doubled in some of the fight scenes due to his heart condition.

""Body and Soul"" begins the night before World Boxing Champion Charley Davis (John Garfield) is to defend his title. He's supposed to throw the fight and make a bundle for the promoter, Mr. Roberts (Lloyd Goff). He's uneasy, can't sleep, and wanders around town seeking comfort -or something- in friends and family with little luck. Right before the fight, Charley drifts into sleep, murmuring ""It's all gone down the drain"" as he begins to dream. Most of the film is in flashback. Charley recalls his humble beginnings as an amateur champion and the pride of his old neighborhood. His mother (Anne Revere) disapproved of boxing, but Charley wanted to break free of the Lower East Side's violence and poverty. He wanted success more than anything in the world. With the help of his old friend Shorty (Joseph Pevney) and his manager Quinn (William Conrad), Charley became a pro with a promising future. But he sacrificed control of his career in a corrupt partnership with Roberts in order to get a championship fight.

John Garfield is too old for this role, but it's still perfect for him. He excelled at playing barely working class tough guys who are foolish and self-destructive, but somehow lovable and sympathetic. Perhaps because Charley came from a life of deprivation, he thinks of nothing but money -making it and spending it- to the detriment of his relationships and his integrity. ""Body and Soul"" is elevated from conspicuous morality tale to classic film by virtue of its supporting cast. William Conrad is terrific as the gruff, two-faced, but somehow sympathetic Quinn, even though he has few lines. And Charley's gold digging mistress, Alice, an even less prominent character, is played memorably by Hazel Brooks. Charley's fiance and beloved Peg, an art student and aspiring painter played by Lilli Palmer, is an odd character. She's intelligent, articulate, and temperate -in contrast to Charley. But her European accent and refined demeanor make her seem as out of place in the film as in the Lower East Side. Somehow, this works in the film's favor by putting Peg on a moral pedestal. ""Body and Soul"" is an entertaining film, a must for John Garfield fans, notable for being one of the first boxing films and one of the last ""social conscience"" films of the classic era. In fact, the film is plainly about the 1930s even though it takes place in the 1940s.

The DVD (Republic/Artisan 1999 release): This is a good print of the film, without serious flaws, but it's not actually restored. I counted 2 momentary audio problems. The single bonus feature is ""Production Notes"", a 7-page essay that discusses the film's inspiration, how Abraham Polonsky came to write it, some anecdotes about filming, and an alternate, more cynical, ending. No subtitles.",1119398400,21,3494,4.898648648648648
504062,4,6302730023,"""Body and Soul"" is a first rate boxing movie.  The story has been told before, seldom as well.  John Garfield is perfectly cast as the young tough from the city slums, desperate to escape poverty and the disgrace, to him, of welfare.  He turns to the ring, as have so many men like him. It is not stated but Garfield looks to be a tough middleweight, like Rocky Graziano or Tony Zale. To have a shot at the championship, he is forced to surrender 50 per cent of his purses to an unsavory hoodlum/gambler. Lloyd Goff is likewise perfectly cast here, repulsively slick in his expensive suits.  It is painfully obvious that Goff makes and breaks kids like Garfield regularly.  Canada Lee, an African American, gives a dignified performance as one Goff had discarded and abused. Garfield, his body intact- minus his soul- attains the championship but loses his best friend and almost his family in his climb.  The in ring boxing scenes are tough and gritty with no holds barred. The portrait of the fight world of the 1940s is stark and bleak- perfect for film noir. The Mob thoroughly dominated the sport in those days- what we see here is just like it must have been. There is blatant allusion to guys throwing fights and betting against themselves. (It lessens the pain of taking a dive!) Shocking, even to this cynical reviewer, was how fighters are ""cut up"". That refers to how many have their hands in a fighter's pocket. Smart guys like Rocky Marciano made some money and retired early! Coupled with some free spending, one wonders how any saved money at all! The fast paced BS covers all these tawdry facets of the ""Sweet Science"". BS can easily stand with many other boxing classics, thought this reviewer can't remember a better suited male lead than Garfield.(Someone important must have agreeed: He was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, losing to the distinguished Ronald Colman in ""A Double Life""). One wonders how closely BS paralleled his own off screen life. Besides the aforementioned Goff and Lee, William Conrad impresses as a smarmy hanger on, ready to turn his back on Garfield as soon as he finds another boy. There are two weak points worthy of mention: Lili Palmer is totally miscast as Garfield's Uptown girlfriend with a Continental accent. Many viewers may also have trouble with the film's ""resolution"", one that would not have happened in the 1940s! According to Silver and Ward's ""Film Noir"", screenwriter Abraham Polansky's ""social conscience"" and Director Robert Rossen's ""idealism"" were responsible. That is all very nice but this reviewer is deducting one star. The ending is unrevealed here! Amazoners are encouraged to watch and enjoy ""Body and Soul"" for themselves. We should never allow a ""questionable"" fadeout to detract from the enjoyment of an otherwise fine movie. A final observation: This reviewer is continually impressed with how many classics were filmed in black and white- a background perfect for BS. Here is one more shining example of why certain releases should never be colorized.",1119312000,,3031,4.898635477582846

I love the Rocky saga, as well as Fat City, but I would have to say that Body and Soul is the best fight film ever made.  It has often been said that boxing movies are all about the same basic things: fighters struggling against promoters and people who would try to control and exploit them, and about the fighter himself overcoming adversities in and out of the ring to ultimatly triumph - whether that means 'winning' or acheiving a personal best (like in Rocky).  Body and Soul is about these things.  The final fight scene holds up with anything modern and it will have you on the edge of your seat.

504064,5,6302730023,"Charlie Davis grew up poor but proud, a brash young kid with fists of stone and an appetite for the better life.  John Garfield plays Davis in BODY AND SOUL, one of the starkest morality plays Hollywood has ever produced.

  BODY AND SOUL is deeply cynical and enjoys a pessimism untainted by many promises of redemption.  People don't fall in love in the world Charlie is so eager to join - they negotiate angry contracts with each other.  William Conrad plays Charlie's manager who at one point loses his girl to Charlie.  In a happier moment Conrad once told her, ""Remember, first mink and then ermine.""  It's a constant theme in the movie - everything is for sale, and the more of you you shell out the better the reward. The girl's bitter fall from Charlie's grace takes her back to Conrad and his rabbit fur territory. Conrad welcomes her back with a snarled ""Looks like you're back in my league.""  ""I don't know,"" she says, ""you're getting kind of old.""  Conrad ends this little woo-pitching session with the pleasant observation that ""You could use a new paint job yourself.""  This is a Social Darwinism without much sociability and one where all the predators are keeping score.

  About the only light radiated in Charlie's life come from girlfriend Peg and his mother, both long-suffering forgivers.  But the lure of the Damned overshadows that of the Graced.  The former dress better and have bigger toys.  Besides, we imagine Charlie tells himself, I can always step away when I've had my fill....

 BODY AND SOUL was custom made for its star and plays to all his strengths.  John Garfield shines in this career defining role that fits him like a glove - a pugnacious and cocky kid from the wrong side of town chases the brass ring and stumbles when he runs into something tougher than his fists and immune to his wise cracks. Garfield's other great acting asset was his ability to explore the dark corners of his soul and take the audience along for a melancholy tour.  Garfield is corruptible, but incapable of being corrupt.  His mortal attempt to reclaim his soul is announced with one of the greatest tough guy lines in movie history: ""What are you gonna do, kill me?  We all gotta die.""

7830388,4,6302730023,"After recently complaining about another boxing movie (Bleed For This which isn't bad) hitting the streets and more on the way, why would I want to watch this old story.  Frankly the plot isn't new but it was for the time.  The film has been sitting on my shelf, begging to be watched and then I remembered why I bought it.  It stars John Garfield who was nominated for an Oscar.  Hes also one of my favorite actors whose career was cut short by McCarthyism and an early death at 39.  The film is essentially the life story of boxing champion Barney Ross.  When Ross became involved in a heroin scandal, the character became Charley Davis (Garfield).

Davis helped out his father in his store and boxed for fun.  When his father was killed in a gangland explosion, Charley decided to make a career out of it, much to his mothers (Anne Revere) dismay.  The film also starred the excellent Lilli Palmer as Peg, Charleys artist fianc.  Peg supported Charleys decision to fight, at least until he got caught up in the sports dark underbelly, organized crime.  Charleys manager, Quinn (William Conrad) becomes a shill for a mobster named Roberts (Lloyd Gough).  Everything is going well until a new, younger up-and-comer works his way up to a title fight with Davis. Roberts and one of his goons are partially responsible for the death of Charleys best friend, Shorty (Joseph Pevney).  That and the memory of an experience years earlier when Charley almost killed a fighter, bring to a head where Charleys morals and capitalistic opportunities collide.

Frankly the film is a bit tired by todays standards but was certainly original for its day.  Directed by Robert Rossen (The Hustler) there is no denying the excellent acting and screenplay (Abraham Polonsky).  In addition to Garfield and Polonskys Oscar nominations, the movie won the Oscar for editing (Francis D. Lyon and Robert Parrish).  The film has some ground breaking fight sequences shot by legendary cinematographer James Wong Howe.  The title references the 1930 Johnny Green song which has been performed by nearly every jazz artist from Coleman Hawkins to the Tony Bennet & Amy Winehouse duet.",1497052800,2,2155,4.873626373626373
