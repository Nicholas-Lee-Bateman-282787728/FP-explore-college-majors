8023072,3,B000278S2S,"I am a great fan of Montgomery, especially  her 'Anne of Green Gables' books. I have read them a thousand times when i was a child and now a mother. I highly recommend them to all. However,  I am deeply shocked and dissapointed that the movies were not quite the same as the original story.

First 2  productions were , in my opinion, considered pretty distorted. But the 3rd was even worse!! It's definitely not Anne of  Green Gables. Hope that someday somebody would come up with the precise story/movie based on the original books of Montgomery.",1129075200,3,548,4.608247422680412
8023073,4,B000278S2S,"Sadly, I have to agree with all complaints against Anne the Continuing Story.  I'm OK with the principle of straying from the original book, but in this case it did NOT work out.  Don't bother buying this 3-in-1 set unless you already know you like the Continuing Story or won't feel complete without every installment of Road to Avonlea and Tales From Avonlea, etc.  I wish kids today were more interested in the kind of quality entertainment the first 2 movies offer.",1123804800,5,469,4.695121951219512
