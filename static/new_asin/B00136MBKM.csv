8300809,1,B00136MBKM,"Mr. Maxwell is very intesting and presents some good arguments, but at other times he is way off base and stretches the Truth as far as it can go without screaming. For example when he tries to explain that Christianity is merely a Solar religion and that Jesus is merely a metaphor for the Sun going through the signs of the Zodiak, he is way off.

He says that Jesus was born of a virgin in the sense that the Sun was at it's highest in the Northern sky and passing through Virgo. But the sun is at it's highest in Gemini(May 21-Jun 20) not Virgo. Then he says that Jesus receives the kiss of death from Judas in Scorpio (Oct 23-Nov 21st),but that's not true, Jesus was betrayed in the Spring. Then he says that after that betrayal Jesus is falling which gives the name Fall to the season, but he didn't die in the Fall. Then he says that Jesus death was a metaphor for December 21st when the sun is at it's lowest, but he DIDN'T die in December. Then he says that since Jesus was resurrected in the Spring which is how the season got it's name because he sprang back to life.

But none of this makes sense. Jesus was NOT born in Virgo (Aug 23-Sep 22)and NOT betrayed in Scorpio (Oct 23-Nov 21) and did NOT die in the Fall; he died in Spring and he did NOT die in Capricorn or December, he died in March-April  during Passover, which is NOT in December, so Mr. Maxwell is way off. His explanation DOES describe Sun Worship and may fit the god Apollo, but it does NOT fit the life of Jesus so that his life could not be an accurate metaphor for the progress of the sun through the Zodiac. He simply juggles around facts, some true and some way off base to confuse the reader like a street person hiding the pea under the shell and moving it around and around until the viewer is thoroughly confused.",1321747200,2,1800,4.226744186046512
