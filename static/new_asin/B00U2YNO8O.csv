7027948,1,B00U2YNO8O,"Very Odd Film!!!  This reminds me of the ""Seinfeld"" TV series  - not really about anything in particular but I kept waiting for a story, plot, point or anything that would connect but it just never happened.  Sorry but I would use this film to make convicted pedophile prisoners suffer by watching over and over and over and over .....",1429574400,2,335,4.55
7027949,5,B00U2YNO8O,A great flick. I really enjoyed the characters. Both deep characters with a love you know is going to continue even when you think it's over.,1429488000,3,141,4.461538461538462
7027950,2,B00U2YNO8O,"Though there are a few good moments here (thus two stars and not one) overall it's disjointed script, unremarkable acting (though the principles are attractive), and very poor editing throws it completely off the rails. If it's a student film, then OK, not the worse effort that I've seen. However, I strongly suspect that the five star reviews all came from cast, crew, their family members and/ or friends. I did make an effort to give it a fair chance, but I couldn't even make it all the way to the end.",1429401600,3,507,4.521739130434782
7027951,5,B00U2YNO8O,"From high drama to tender intimacy and with quite a few gentle comic moments, this is an impressionistic and intimate love story between two people who try to reconcile their personal demons and battle-scars with the reality of a relationship and the ideal of what a relationship should be. It is an examination of love, friendship, passion, integrity, hope and self destruction. The acting is honest (sometimes brutally so) and never falls into cliche', and so is the writing, while visually it is understated and confident. You will not regret spending some time with these people.",1429228800,10,583,5.083333333333333
7027952,5,B00U2YNO8O,"This film is packed with stars, great acting and great directing.  The camera work is stunning.  Highly recommend the film.",1429142400,2,123,5.1

7027955,5,B00U2YNO8O,"What is there not to love about this film. The cast is A+!  Amy Seimetz, Bret Roberts, Donal Logue, Foster Timms, Brian McGuire, Dale Dickey, Harry Dean Stanton, James Duval, Joey Capone and many other great actors.  It's dark and romantic.  Highly recommend.",1428969600,2,259,4.976744186046512
7027956,4,B00U2YNO8O,"Wow, as a fan of Cassavetes, I was pleasantly surprised by this film!  Love is never an easy to understand thing.  It always has quite a few twists and turns, and this film deals with all that in a refreshing way.  You don't see this type of story telling in mainstream cinema.  The performances are strong and nuanced.",1513641600,,319,4.448275862068965
7027957,4,B00U2YNO8O,"i love films with fully developed characters, and like a deliberate pace when it makes sense.  In the case of this move, both worked. Recommended.",1513036800,,146,4.84
7027958,4,B00U2YNO8O,"9 FULL MOONS is a really inventive film that is deeply personal and entertaining! As other reviewers mentioned, it focuses on a an unconventional portrayal of a female lead character's attempt to compensate for her loneliness by starting new relationships every new moon. I felt this really gave it a unique perspective that I had not seen before both in tone and story structure. It had a rawness that really stuck with me, making it me forget it was indie, or low-budget. It just didn't matter... 9 FULL MOONS is plain old good! NICE WORK!",1511913600,,541,4.705263157894737
7027959,5,B00U2YNO8O,"Watch the whole thing! Glad to see the rule ""Treat the audience like they're idiots"", didn't apply to this film. Good indie film",1511913600,,128,4.608695652173913
7027960,5,B00U2YNO8O,"Not a fake-film relationship, but one that feels real, lived in. Fascinating to watch the relationship deconstruct in snippets during 9 full moons, hence the title. Very raw, genuine, gripping. And a great cast! The leads were terrific. And fun to see the late Harry Dean Stanton and the awesome Pamela Adlon in small roles. If you like Indie films, you will really enjoy this!",1510617600,,377,4.815384615384615
7027961,4,B00U2YNO8O,Great movie overall.  It did have a slow start but it picked up.  I recognized a lot of the places they shot because I do live in LA.  Overall great movie and will recommend to others!,1510272000,,184,4.055555555555555
7027962,5,B00U2YNO8O,Intriguing study about people and relationships. Excellent indie film with excellent cinematography and acting. This film effectively delves into the psyche of the characters and provides for a very interesting character study.,1510012800,,227,6.125
7027963,4,B00U2YNO8O,"In a world where we need more female voices helming motion pictures, 9 Full Moons is a very sensory, vivid picture with a unique tale about a hard-partying woman who compensates her loneliness by dating different men but falls for a musician with a different viewpoint than hers.  It's entertaining, very interpersonal, and it's a picture I feel is something that is missing in the independent world.  Check it out for yourself.  It's a great watch.",1509926400,,449,4.881578947368421
7027964,4,B00U2YNO8O,I love indies and I love intense emotional journeys and this one is no exception. I saw it at a festival last year and thought it was great.,1509494400,,140,4.035714285714286
7027965,5,B00U2YNO8O,"So much to digest with this film. It hits you and hits you hard. The filmmaking is also fresh and production values impressive, especially for an indie. If you're looking for something that moves you, definitely check it out.",1509494400,,225,4.794871794871795
7027966,4,B00U2YNO8O,Such a unique and well told story!,1509321600,,34,4.0
7027967,4,B00U2YNO8O,"Great little indie film.  A very intense film in the sense of relationships. If you like deep movies then this one for you. I really enjoyed the way the film flowed it didn't lose me for a second. The acting was good, a little slow in the beginning but it made up when you find yourself locked into the story about a 3rd of the way through. Good watch, so kick off the boots and sit back with your honey and watch a good little film.",1508976000,,433,4.034883720930233
7027968,5,B00U2YNO8O,Beautifully made. Fantastic cast. This is a truly wonderful film.,1508889600,,65,5.6
7027969,5,B00U2YNO8O,"Why do you need all this garbage in your life?  this is a quote from Bret Roberts character in this film, and it is a sentiment that resonates throughout the movie. The characters are messy, sometimes horrible people, but the story is truly about how people need other people. Amy Seimetz completely disappears into her role as Frankie, giving a wonderfully nuanced, raw, subdued performance that feels incredibly real.  Donal Logue and the rest of the cast all give equally solemn, real performances.",1508889600,,501,5.024096385542169
7027970,4,B00U2YNO8O,"This was such a unique movie, and such a heartfelt one at that! It's an independent film, but it looked great. And I was impressed with the acting. It's such a fun premise also, I'm surprised no one's done this before. Worth watching!",1508889600,,234,4.465116279069767
7027971,4,B00U2YNO8O,"Dispate the gaps of a low budget, this movie managed to connect me and kept me entertained trough the whole film. It Is very touching and shows our reality about relationships. Worth to watch",1508889600,,191,4.647058823529412
7027972,5,B00U2YNO8O,"This movie is about people. It's about how complicated and seemingly hopeless relationships can sometimes be when two hard-headed, damaged, but big hearted souls come together like planets colliding. It's about how tenuous life is when your dreams outmatch your means. It's about the barrage of disappointments that seem to constantly fall over your head like buckets of hot coals when you're an artist, fighting for a way to keep living as such and stay sane... and possibly love something somewhere in between. There is a lot layered into this film, and director Tomer Almagor works like an alchemist, getting performances from his two leads that are both volcanic and delicate. It's not a movie for those indoctrinated into the modern culture of tentpole productions and plot signposting. There is an immersive quality to this work that, when the viewer allows themselves to be enveloped by it, can transport one into a world inhabited by people you might feel you've known at some point in your life,  felt empathy for, and perhaps loved with great difficulty. Worth a watch for those who want to feel something deeper and more complex from a work of art than is usually allowed in these fast times  we live in.",1508803200,,1215,4.893203883495145
7027973,5,B00U2YNO8O,Great indie filmmaking. In the vein of Blue Valentine.,1508716800,,54,5.111111111111111
7027974,5,B00U2YNO8O,Dude... This Film rocks! You have to watch it. That's all I have to say. You will not regret it.,1508630400,,96,3.85
7027975,4,B00U2YNO8O,"9 Full Moons is a fantastic film about the reality of falling in and out of love and how it can be found and lost unexpectedly. The film is gritty and feels real. I love some of the shot choices and framing of the characters. The cinematography really puts you in the scenes. I also like how it doesn't follow a traditional narrative structure, just like life. The performances are powerful and grounded. It's very well done for a smaller scale indie film.",1508630400,,456,4.506024096385542
7027976,5,B00U2YNO8O,An interesting way to weave the story.  Nice cinematography.,1508544000,,60,5.666666666666667
7027977,4,B00U2YNO8O,"I enjoyed this indie drama because it's very realistic. How do we usually get over someone? by getting under someone else! Yes, it's a character flaw but the truth and this movie takes a look at how one woman escapes her feelings by sleeping around.",1508457600,,249,4.555555555555555
7027978,4,B00U2YNO8O,"This movie is full of surprises, I love the pace of the movie, highly romantic but the heartbreak leaves a bitter taste in my head",1508371200,,130,4.24
7027979,4,B00U2YNO8O,"This lovely and bittersweet story about life and what passes for love doesn't follow any formulas. Some folks will feel uncomfortable walking in these characters' shoes and the journey is not easy -- but it's real, and honest, and tender. Unconventionally told, the moments add up to a whole that is kind of like life: bits of happiness and terror, some confusion, a huge sense of loss, a hunger to connect. Plus, Harry Dean Stanton makes an appearance. If you like your movies real and not formulaic, check this one out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1508371200,,561,4.793814432989691
7027980,1,B00U2YNO8O,"Not enough dialogue (some movies use this to great affect - this is not one of them). Shallow character development. Usually you like one character in a movie, but in this one, it's hard to like any of them. The movie ends with the viewer still waiting for something to happen (plot-wise) and for the main characters to find the redemption and more hopeful life trajectories they need.",1488153600,,385,4.676470588235294
7027981,2,B00U2YNO8O,I did not like it.,1483920000,,18,2.8
7027982,4,B00U2YNO8O,"Real and tender.  Editing could have used some work in the first third of the movie.  Character development was slowed due to this initial poor editing.  connection between Liv and Frankie was believable. She was fragile to perfection.  He was internally lost which made a hard to read, yet believable character.  Film lacks good production and was obviously made on a shoestring budget with a small community of people who believed in the project. A few brief appearances by better known actors  A little gem for those with a little patients that don't require the neat and tidy plots or HD glam to appreciate a movie.",1483488000,2,619,4.7924528301886795
7027983,1,B00U2YNO8O,They lost me at the scene where the woman was passed out and one of the male characters took advantage of this.,1483401600,,111,4.090909090909091

7027996,4,B00U2YNO8O,A treatise on a flawed relationship that is both frank and raw. A slow burn with good performances from the two leads. At its core it is a dark romance brooding on a relationship between two damaged people.,1478476800,,206,4.447368421052632
7027997,3,B00U2YNO8O,A bit slow.  The story was not very intersting or intriguing.  But pretty good acting and worth the watch.,1477526400,,106,4.526315789473684

7028003,2,B00U2YNO8O,"self destructive characters nearly always have ""help"" from parental misguidance and the pushers of All Co Hell and the various drugs depicted in this movie. But they aren't any fun to watch even with good photography and direction.",1470441600,,231,5.105263157894737
7028004,4,B00U2YNO8O,"9 Full Moons is an intimate story about relationships, life, love and the things in between.

7028006,4,B00U2YNO8O,A kind of slow indie film meditation on the process of a relationship coming apart. It digs deep into the characters and gives us a lot to think about. I'd definitely recommend it if you like films like Blue Valentine.,1468972800,2,218,4.475
7028007,4,B00U2YNO8O,"I watched this primarily because Donal Logue is in it and I am huge fan of Gotham, he does not solve crimes with Jim Gordon but gives a pretty good supporting performance. I usually don't take chances on movies like this but it was a beautifully told story about two desperate, damaged, lonely people",1468368000,,300,4.574074074074074
7028008,4,B00U2YNO8O,Such an interesting study in relationships. It really delves into the psyche and takes you on a ride through the turmoil and twists of love. It is one of those films you really need to stick with past the first few minutes though.,1467849600,,230,4.372093023255814

7028010,1,B00U2YNO8O,"one of the worst movies ever. What a colossal waste of time, yet I kept watching because sometimes, rare though they are, movies can twist into something wonderful. This one did not. It was depressing ON PURPOSE and I find that unforgivable. There is NO joy in this film. Your time would be better spent staring into space.",1465257600,,323,4.586206896551724

PS:  this is talent you need to follow along with because they're only better with every new movie.  I enjoyed the cameos by Harry Dean.. and was VERY pleasantly surprised to see Louis CK's girlfriend in the ""Louie"" TV series Pamela Adlon show up.  I mean I sat up in my seat and hushed everybody so I could watch her act and talk.  It was then I realized I had a celebrity crush.

But I guess there's someone for everyone out there. Without giving anything away there was a scene where the writer tried to paint sympathy for the heroine, but her reaction to what happened to her turned me off.  A dark picture and somewhat of a love story. You want to root for them, just a little bit.",1436745600,,440,4.176470588235294

7028093,5,B00U2YNO8O,"When the movie got going, I really liked it. It's the story of two different people and their love. It shows how emotionally different they are and the different personalities, bound to clash. The sex scenes are tender and emotional. I was especially impressed with the scene in which she learns she's pregnant, then tosses out the booze and what I guessed to be pot, two things that could harm her baby. Then come the part where he comes home and there's no booze or pot, and he gets pissed, until she tell him she's pregnant. A sweet scene. Amy Seimetz is praiseworthy for her performance, as is her costar.",1432771200,,609,4.545454545454546

7028111,3,B00U2YNO8O,"This movie was oddly captivating; probably because of Bret Roberts.  What was it about?  Hard to say. But here are some themes:  falling in love, friendship, kindness, working a dead end job, alcoholism/drug addiction and its effects, living together, trying to get your act together to please another, pregnancy, and being a decent human being.  Two very damaged individuals meet, and are instantly attracted to each other. He has a job as a limo driver and is a musician with sound engineering talents, who lands a job working with an ageing and washed up Country Western Singer trying to make a comeback. We never quite find out what she does or how she supports herself, but we know her ex-husband is a musician and she hangs out in a bar listening to him perform.  Lev, her new boyfriend shows her kindness, loyalty and patience, and soon they move in with each other.  They are good for each other for a season, until life encroaches.  She becomes more tidy, stops drinking and drugging, and changes.  They love each other for ""9 Full Moons"", and maybe longer...but the ending is inconclusive. You are left wondering what is to become of Lev (Bret Roberts) as the ending is inconclusive.",1430697600,3,1193,4.757281553398058
