5614937,2,B00BFGHQ14,"We had the same problem as other commenters with the sound - ambient sounds (birds etc) and music came through clearly but the voices (and, critically, Salman Rushdie's voiceover) were missing.  We had a very helpful Amazon assistant - Emily - run through the troubleshooting protocol and that did not fix it.  We even rented the non-HD version and that had the same problem.  I like Amazon Instant Video and will not be deterred by this experience, but Amazon really needs to delete this version of the file from the host server and reload a version that works.",1388707200,3,562,4.714285714285714
5614938,3,B00BFGHQ14,"Perhaps the emphasis is on the visual and the lack of audio was a device used to focus on relationships, what is done not what is said.  But what is said does matter.",1388275200,,166,4.03030303030303
5614939,2,B00BFGHQ14,"Yeah!  Their mouths were moving and there should have been their voices coming over, and sometimes it did.  But not most of the time.  We even fast forwarded to 50% + of the footage and still, had that going on.  We just watched another movie and will get into Amazon's crediting dept. tomorrow.

Love the characters, the setting, the history, and a touch of fantasy. Simply a great story! I would definitely recommend this movie!",1386460800,,246,4.744186046511628
5614941,4,B00BFGHQ14,"This movie is based on the award-winning book of the same title by Salman Rushdie. The screenplay is written by Salman Rushdie, he is one of the producers and he narrates the story. It is filmed in Sri Lanka and Toronto, Canada. The characters are wonderfully portrayed, the settings are lush, the costumes are sumptuous and the music is beautiful and evocative. Shriya Saran, Shabana Azmi, Seema Biswas and Darsheel Safary are especially good. Altogether a marvellous cinematic experience.",1386028800,2,490,5.215189873417722
5614942,4,B00BFGHQ14,"An interesting way to show India's early independence from British rule and some of the issues India faced and still does on how it's people are to be governed. A second theme was/is the discord between Muslim and Hindi and noted in the film's showing of the East Pakistan to Bangladesh conflict. Rushdie's occasional narrative helps the viewer understand the story's direction. However, because of cultural and time differences in this story, the actor's dialogue is especially important. Since English dialects differ greatly as well as some actor's not clearly enunciating added to poor film audio clarity all together made it difficult to follow the story. It would have been helpful to have subtitles for all the dialogue and not just the non-English parts.",1383177600,,762,5.153225806451613
5614943,4,B00BFGHQ14,GOOD MOVIE.  WILL SEE IT WHEN I GET BACK HOME SINCE I AM DEPLOYED.  WILL LET YOU THEN WHEN I SEE IT.,1376179200,,100,3.5
5614944,4,B00BFGHQ14,"""Midnight's Children"" (2012 release; 148 min.) is a movie based in Salman Rushdie's book of the same name. Rushdie returns as the writer of the movie script. As the movie opens, we find ourselves in rural India, 1917, where we get to meet the Sinai family. The first half hour of the movie is simply an introduction to the beauty of India, its historical background (with the divide between Muslims and Hinuds, while being ruled by the British), and to the grandparents and parents of the movie's eventual central character, a boy named Saleem Sinai. Saleem is born at the stroke of midnight on August 14, 1947, the moment that India gains its independence. For reasons too long to explain here, the nurse at the hospital, inspired by her 'revolutionary' husband who claims that ""the rich shall be poor and the poor shall be rich"", switches two babies born at the same time, one from a rich family, and one from a poor street musician couple. As Saleem gets older, he begins to hear voices in his head, much to his excitement (but to the chagrin of his demanding father). Saleem eventually sees visions of other children who were also born within the first hour after that midnight of India's independence (hence the movie's title). Saleem's father, out of desparation, sends him away to go live with his wife's sister in Pakistan. At this point we're not even half-way into the movie. Will Saleem's parents eventualy learn of the babies' switch? What will become of the boy now living on the streets who should've been living the rich life? What will become of Saleem's visions of the other ""midnight's children""? To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is an epic movie in scope and tone, and it shows as such on the big screen. The visuals of the movie are never anything less than gorgeous, and for that reason alone I would recommend this movie. But there is much more of course. The story itself is as much about India as a country, as it is about the two boys who are switched at birth and their respective surrounding families. The divide between rich and poor will make you shake your head at times (and of course remains in place to this date, if it's not worse now). Director Deepa Mehta and writer Salman Rushdie find the right balance between historical drama and personal stories, the likes of which we don't get to see very much anymore these days. I wonder what the budget of this movie was, but it certainly looks and feels like a mega-budget movie.

Bottom line: if you are in the mood for an epic movie that feels as if it could've been made decades ago, you cannot go wrong with this. Imagine my surprise when this movie showed up, pretty much unannounced and without any prior hype, at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati this weekend. Imagine my bigger surprise yet, when the screening I attended was absolutely packed! It appears I am not the only one who is eagerly seeking out this type of movie. ""Midnight's Children"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1371340800,17,3124,4.657608695652174

8567751,5,B00BFGHQ14,"My wife and I enjoyed this story which is a nice little history of the separation of Pakistan (and Bangledesh) from India. Woven around the historical events is the story of ""Midnight's Children"", mutants with gifts and powers that the countries should have embraced rather than imprisoned. I found the story a subtle exploration of young people reaching out to each other and exploring each other's dreams. No, I can't explain that last one. Although I'm sure the author never watched an X-Men movie (horrors!), this movie will appeal to fans of that series as well.

8567753,4,B00BFGHQ14,"I had to watch this long film (2.5 hours) in chunks of time, and it was worth it.  Lovely cinematography.  Charming epic tale.",1444521600,,126,4.434782608695652
8567754,5,B00BFGHQ14,"This is a brilliant adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel of the same name. With fine acting and beautiful cinematography it tells the story of India's 'midnight's children-those born in the hour after midnight when India and Pakistan were partitioned in 1947. These children have special powers. The film focuses on the life of one of them, Saleem Sinai a poor Muslim boy switched at birth with another wealthy Hindu boy. Raised as a wealthy Hindu child his life encompasses the history of India and Pakistan from Partition through Indira Gandhi's State of Emergency.

I had no problems with the picture or sound quality of the DVD.  A small amount of the film is subtitled and those titles are tiny and difficult to read. The film does require that the viewer have some knowledge of Indian history. I particularly enjoyed the narration by Rushdie himself.",1406678400,9,856,4.9375
8567755,1,B00BFGHQ14,"This dvd was advertised as being closed captioned. The cover has ""CC"" on it. IT IS A LIE. The actors have heavy Indian accents and therefore it is impossible to understand 75% of the dialogue. It is unwatchable.",1399852800,,211,4.578947368421052
8567756,4,B00BFGHQ14,"Had just finished reading Salman Rusdie's memoir Joseph Anton. This definately helped me to fullu understand the movie even more. The direction was top-class and it was interesting to hear Rusdie,himself, doing the narration.",1390953600,2,225,5.647058823529412
8567757,3,B00BFGHQ14,It was very interesting but would help if you had a knowledge of India and Pakistan's history.  My husband and I were motivated to look at maps and read about the formation of Pakistan.,1389312000,,185,4.4411764705882355
