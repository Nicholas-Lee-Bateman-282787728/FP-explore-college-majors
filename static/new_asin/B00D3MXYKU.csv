5772567,5,B00D3MXYKU,A wonderful look into the season. The extras were very nice especially for reliving the 4th quarters of games 6 and 7 of the Finals,1376092800,,131,4.28
5772568,5,B00D3MXYKU,"(This is my first review on a product, so hopefully I do a good job but before I get started, please follow me on twitter. My twitter handle is @miamiprodigy. If you follow me, I will follow you right back..... Anyways lets get this review started.)

 If your a basketball fan (and not a LeBron James/ Heat hater) you should already know that the 2012-2013 Miami Heat is ""arguably"" one of the top 10 basketball teams in NBA history and this dvd/blu ray relives all the greatest moments that the Miami Heat gave us. This blu ray (the dvd and blu ray are exactly the same except the blu ray has a better picture quality) will show you everything, from the Miami Heat's time in China during the pre season, to opening night where they received there 2012 championship rings, to the most important parts in the Heats regular season and of course they go in depth with the Heat's amazing post season run.

 This championship blu ray explains everything that the Miami Heat did historically from Leberon James being the first player in NBA History to score 30 points, while shooting 60 percent from the field for 6 straight games (which is Amazing), To the Miami Heat winning 27 straight games which is the 2nd longest winning streak in NBA History. Than they talk about the Miami Heat's playoff run with the Heat sweeping the bucks, to beating the bulls in 5 games and the classic series between the Heat and Pacers that took 7 games. Than this blu ray goes in depth with the NBA finals series between the Heat and the Spurs.... they show everything, from tony parker's miracle shot over LBJ in Game 1 to LBJ's massive block on tiago splitter in game 2 and of course ray allen's miracle shot in game 6.... This documentary shows it all.

As for the Bonus features on the dvd/blu ray, They give us the entire 4th quarter/OT of the NBA FINALS Game 6 (which is one of the best FINALS games you will ever see.) The entire 4th quarter of the NBA FINALS game 7. A 2 min player profile on the Heat's whipping boy mario chalmers. A 3min video called Miami Heat All Acess, which only shows the Miami Heat practicing. Than we have Lebron James and Dwyane wade's social media profile where each of them explain there greatest moments, Them making fun of coach Spo and where you can find them on twitter.

So is this the best championship documentary that I have ever seen.... NO. I believe the 2006 Miami Heat championship dvd was the best but this blu ray does it's job by reliving all the greatest moments that the Miami Heat gave us this past season and that's all anyone can ask for and that's why this gets 5 Stars.

The two things that I wish for was a more in depth look at the Miami Heat's regular season (This section was only 15 mins long in a 70 min documentary) and more special features (I wish they showed the entire Heat vs Cavs game back on March 20th, 2013.... where the Heat were down by 27 points in the 3rd quarter but still came back to win to continue there streak.)

But other than that, this is close to perfect.... and I believe this is a must buy for any basketball fan.",1375228800,5,3080,4.391228070175439
5772569,5,B00D3MXYKU,I really enjoyed this DVD and would recommend it to any Miami Heat/NBA fan. It also includes bonus material like the 4th quarter and OT of Game 6 which for my money is probably one of the greatest bits of basketball I've ever seen. Also includes a Blu-Ray disc.,1419292800,,261,4.346938775510204

Like the fact that the dvd has game 6 and game 7 of the Finals",1380672000,,101,3.857142857142857
5772583,4,B00D3MXYKU,"I bought it for coverage of the Spurs wins in the Finals. It gave the Spurs their due props, and covered the excitement of a great Finals series, even if I didn't like the final results. The NBA should put out season Review DVDS for all the NBA teams, or at least those that make a deep playoff run. Fans like me would buy them to re-live the excitement of a great season. They do it with English soccer. The NBA is missing out on making more money and giving fans what they want. The Micro movies of each series of the playoffs are wonderfully done by the nba.com! Why not put them on a disc for for fans? Even if it was cumulative, and all on one DVD titled the PLAYOFFS!",1378080000,3,673,4.106060606060606
5772584,5,B00D3MXYKU,It was great. It was very enjoyable. S great dvd combo to have in a collection. I loved it .thanks,1377993600,,98,3.95
5772585,2,B00D3MXYKU,We were under the impression that the dvd showed all 3 years and it was a dvd of only the 2013 year,1377907200,,99,3.5454545454545454
5772586,4,B00D3MXYKU,"It's fun to relieve the one of the greatest season in Miami Heat history. The picture quality is great and show most of the important plays of the year.

My only gripe is that there was not enough on the playoffs and the 28 games winning streak.",1377475200,,245,4.212765957446808
5772587,3,B00D3MXYKU,"The content on this Blu-Ray/DVD combo is good.  The main feature, which covers the entire 2012-2013 season -- including the regular season, the ""streak"", the playoffs and finals -- is a little on the short side, at 67 minutes running time.  The 2011-2012 main feature, for comparison, clocked in at 78 minutes.  Still, it's a nice look back at the championship season.

The extra features are a mixed bag.  The best inclusions are the replays of Finals Game 6 Q4 and OT (46 minutes running time) and Finals Game 7 Q4 (28 minutes) against the Spurs, which is some of the most exciting basketball that I can remember ever seeing.  I greatly appreciated having these replays included.  The other extra features -- LeBron James and Dwyane Wade social media profiles, Mario Chalmers player profile, and Miami Heat ""All Access"" -- are mostly worthless.  They're only a couple of minutes long each, and on top of that they include some footage already seen in the main feature.  I didn't even bother watching these extra features all the way through.

On the other hand, the Blu-Ray quality is mediocre at best.  Audio is stereo only.  Also, note that virtually all video is interlaced, including the finals replay bonus features in their entirety.  You may not notice this, depending on the quality of your player, or it may appear as visible combing, ghosting, or blurring.  The in-game footage, of course, with its fast action and quick camera moves is most sensitive to interlacing.  I'm not sure why NBA Entertainment is working with interlaced source material, but I think it really detracts from the viewing experience.

All in all, the stereo audio and interlaced video is annoying but not enough to torpedo an otherwise good dvd, but it's worth mentioning since this is the only Blu-Ray I've ever purchased with these limitations.  I purchased this package, by the way, directly from the NBA store and not through Amazon.

For content, this package gets 4.5 stars.  For Blu-Ray quality, 2 stars.",1376784000,,1997,4.8898809523809526
5772588,5,B00D3MXYKU,Bluray quality is the best. If anything buy this for the bonus footage of Lebrons greatest comeback ever - the 4th qtr/ot  of game six in its entirety as Lebron takes over and lays it out on court with failure staring him down his throat.  4th quarter of game 7 is classic do or die all the marbles sports - in entirety - wish they had game 7 Indiana series or 27 game streak live footage but this bluray is well filled with great basketball,1376611200,,441,4.176470588235294
8589080,3,B00D3MXYKU,Recommended for any Heat fan. I thought it was the version I saw on Youtube a while back where Alonzo Mourning was narrating but this one is done by Ahmad Rashad. Not as energetic but still great nevertheless. Worth watching again and again to relive the 27 game win streak season leading up to the most dramatic NBA finals ending in recent memory.,1506124800,,348,4.5396825396825395
