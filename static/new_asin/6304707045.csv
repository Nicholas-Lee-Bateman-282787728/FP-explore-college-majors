He also does great low key comedy roles - plus he dances like a dream.  I just can't ever figure out his hair.  In the Prophecy Trilogy, he is great, as always, breathing life into the role like only he can do.  I'd say he was both Angel/devil.  All one has to do is read the Bible.  Those Angels slaughtered thousands of people when told, generated a whole wealth of deceit and violence - very thin line and Mr. Walken just does that so well.",1478822400,,561,4.12962962962963

I watched this because I had seen the first one years ago and wanted to finish off the series with one left to go. Who could ask for anything more... you have Christopher as Gabriel the rouge Angel causing literally hell on earth while the whole time he is using his great looks, and the classic Walken language and lines as he slices and dices his wall all over this movie on the way to kill Jennifer Beals.

I got it simply for Chris and it paid off fantastically. If you like the guy and his odd, quirky ways then this movie will not let you down.",1415577600,,636,4.19672131147541

916377,4,6304707045,"I'll admit I was slightly hesitant about this sequel. I mean, sequels usually dissapoint don't they?

That being said I have to admit I was very pleased with this addition. While the first one lagged a bit too much at parts for my taste, this one started off with a bang and kept on going. They sped up the pace of the movie to a more mainstream level in certain ways but managed to keep the original magic of the original.

Walken is as great as ever (this man is a genious) and really makes this entire series. His new sidekick is a recently dead girl by the choice of suicide. He knows nothing about technology and it's as obvious as can be, which adds doses of humor. The starring cast is as well-done as the original's, and we grow to really care what happens to each character. However, while Eric Roberts is a gifted actor, I didn't think he quite fit into the part of Michael. While we don't really get Lucifer we do get to meet more archangels, which paints another layer of depth. The ending where they met in a current, run-down eden of sorts of a nice directional touch; the movie is again beautifully filmed. There is a pretty trippy sex scene that goes on in the beginning of the film, which caused the MPAA raters to give include ""extreme sexual act"". (rolls eyes) It is not the everday sex scene; there is no excess nudity. We are fighting this time for a woman with a child in here, this time with the aide of an angel...basically very similar to the first along the plot lines (that time it was a woman and child with a man, an ex-priest). Betrayal, dissapointment, love, lust, they're all touched upon here.

The scene right before the finale is both beautiful and tragic at the same time. The ending wasn't what I had expected, and makes me anxious to see the third installment.",1379635200,,1798,4.393393393393393
916378,3,6304707045,"Just managed to hit a wrong key and lost a longer review of the film which I had typed, so I will be brief. This was a dark, murky, incoherent movie which made little use of its most talented players. In essence,  most scenes were shot as if in a semi-lighted cellar, most dialogue was sound recorded as if being careful to see that the audience did not have a chance to hear the stumbling scenario, this was abetted by the absence of subtitles, the plot did advance the series slightly but was essentially incoherent, and the actors were forced into a constraint which left little room for their talent. It almost seemed to be as throwaway  so that they could move right on to the next in the series. If you are committed to follow the story to the end, then you must see this, I assume,  before going on to number 3. If you can make do with the preliminary that surely will lead off the next in the series, there would not be much necessity to watch this one. The general viewer will not find much entertainment here.",1378857600,,1019,4.324607329842932
916379,5,6304707045,"I'm a little biased because I love Christopher Walken. No matter what movie he may be in you, you can expect to see something wild or awkward. He's comical and yet can demonstrate a disturbing feeling where you don't want to meet him in real life, or just simply hear what the next thing he will say. But you can bet whatever he does next, it'll be a trip to the museum. I love this movie considering he's a bit of a die hard with a vengeance, kind of deal. Dramatic, deadly, and vengeful, Walken's character is out for justice, even if it will bring Heaven and the Human Race (or even God) to its/His knees. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Heaven VS Hell movies, or Christopher Walken. Even if you like neither, I would recommend this movie anyway because it's such a good film.",1370736000,,790,4.344594594594595

916381,4,6304707045,"The war for Heaven is far from over, as Gabriel returns to Earth to seek out the woman who holds the fate of humanity within her womb. THE PROPHECY 2 gets off to an electrifying start with Gabriel's rebirth out of the fiery pits of Hell, but the dark imagery does not stop there. From the shadowy reveal of Danyael's angelic wings to the industrial wasteland that is the Garden of Eden, Greg Spence has built upon Gregory Widen's apocalyptic vision in a sequel that even surpasses the original in its dreary mood and atmosphere. Christopher Walken is far more menacing as well, allowing the wicked humor of Spence's script to bleed through his sinister performance with all of the same wild eccentricities as before. THE PROPHECY 2 isn't burdened by an overcomplicated plot, allowing the actors and imagery to take over and drive the picture to its sacrificial end.

916382,4,6304707045,"Four years after the events of The Prophecy, Gabriel returns and the war in the heavens continues unabated.  It is surprisingly difficult to find good guys among any of these angels, but the new plan to thwart Gabriel's long-sought destruction of humanity involves the far less than immaculate conception of a child to human and angelic parents.  As Gabriel himself points out, the existence of Nephilim upon the earth didn't work out very well back in the early days following Creation - but it's apparently the best plan the archangel Michael can come up with.  Somehow the existence of a new Nephilim, possessing the powers of an angel and the free will of a human, is supposed to bring the warring angel factions together.  It doesn't make much sense to me, but hey - I'm just a puny human incapable of understanding the advanced wisdom of heaven's forces.

If you're wondering what happened to Thomas Daggett, would-be priest turned detective turned prophet from the first movie, that question is answered early on in this sequel.  From there, the focus of the story quickly turns to Valerie Rosales (Jennifer Beals), who engages in the world's weirdest one-night stand with a  man (actually an angel) she hits with her car (actually, I believe he hit her car as he fell from heaven).  Anyway, the universe's fastest-growing unborn child is conceived, and it's up to the baby's father, Danyeal (Russell Wong), and the archangel Michael (Eric Roberts) to protect both child and mother from Gabriel.  Coming along for the ride this time is Izzy (Brittany Murphy), whom Gabriel has kept alive following her lover's pact suicide with her boyfriend.  Gabriel can turn people to salt and turn rivers red with blood, but he can't drive a car or operate the most basic of computers.

As in the first movie, Christopher Walken steals the show.  All other characters, no matter how important they are in terms of the second war in heaven, are merely bit players in Walken's world.  Sure, Gabriel hates all of us ""monkeys"" whom God elevated above angels when He gave us souls, but it's pretty hard to root against this guy - especially since the archangel Michael turns out to be (in my opinion, anyway) a great disappointment.  This is supposed to be the angel that led God's forces against Satan's rebel legions in the first war?  Thankfully, there are some other angels brave enough to face Gabriel, as there's nothing like a good throw-down between ethereal forces.

I actually enjoyed this sequel more than the first movie.  Walken may well be the only actor capable of truly portraying Gabriel, and he is absolutely at his best in The Prophecy II.  There's even more dark humor this time around in terms of his relationships with humans and their technology, and I found this ending (particularly in terms of the setting) much better than that of the first movie.  Fans of The Prophecy will almost certainly enjoy The Prophecy II as much if not more than the original.",1342915200,5,2968,4.818540433925049

Gabriel is able to return to Earth because Lucifer says, ""The isn't room for them both in Hell."" Eeeeh. Ok.
The plot in this one is, Jeniffer Bealls is pregnant thanks to having sex with an angel named Danael (Daniel). Russel Wong plays Danael. If the child is born, it will be a nephilim which is half human and half angel. It will have the abilities of an angel but the free will of a human. Basically a god among men.
The entire movie is her running from him, trying to stay alive. By the end, they finally do the go-to ending of, ""Do you have faith?"" that you will see coming from a mile away. Not a spoiler. Trust me.
There is a small part by Eric Roberts as Michael. Not the best performance and not the best choice for this character.
Gabriel again, must enlist the help of humans that are on the edge of death. Brittany Murphy is not too bad in this role. This is actually a funny part of the movies that I agree with other reviewers is worth seeing.
I recommend the 3 part series (not 4 and 5) if you are a fan of the story and Christopher Walken as Gabriel.",1286323200,2,1155,4.026086956521739

I have to admire a low-budget horror film that takes such pains to provide a philosophical underpinning to its story.  Director / co-screenwriter Greg Spence and co-screenwriters Gregory Widen and Matt Greenberg appear to take their theology seriously.  I just wish they could have dramatized it more effectively.  The result is a fog of stalkings, car crashes, and beatings, culminating in a dull faceoff in an industrial park, replete with obligatory steam and rusty iron catwalks.",1275177600,,671,5.185185185185185

916476,5,6304707045,"This movie wasn't put together in the best way. There was a poor choice of actors (excluding Christopher Walken of course). But if you were expecting to see a blockbuster hit in a straight-to-video sequel to ""The Prophecy"" then you should have stayed in bed. But if you were expecting to laugh hysterically at each and every hastily made scene, listen to crummy cue-card dialogue, or maybe just to witness just how creepy Christopher Walken can look and sound, then ""The Prophecy 2"" is perhaps the film for you. I'm sure it was a seemingly good idea to make this film, after all, even the worst films known to mankind rake in some profit for the filmmakers. It is worth mentioning that Glenn Danzig (""Muthahhhh!"") made a cameo appearance as a rogue angel, but only for a mere 30 seconds. Glenn, if you are reading this, I remain very disappointed with this movie because I heard not one of your songs! So, Glenn vanishes, the movie drags on for another 45 minutes, and then towards the end my mind began to wander.

Christopher Walken is good as usual as the archangel Gabriel who wants to find Beals and make sure she doesn't have that little boy.  Russell Wong is the staunch angel hero trying to protect Beals and Eric Roberts has a small role as Michael.  Brittany Murphy is well cast in the role of the unwilling Gabriel henchwoman.

It works out like this Angel meets up with a woman knocks her up and then another bigger meaner angel comes around looking to kill the baby and her if need be. Now just watch the scene where Christopher Walken arises from Hell onto earth. Ass and all it is VERY similar to that of Arnie's arival from future to present.

916479,4,6304707045,"After watching the movie ""The Prophecy"" for the first time a few years after it was initially released, I was able to go and watch ""The Prophecy 2"" directly after it. At first I didn't like this movie as much, the tone was different, albeit much darker than the first one, and the idea of an angel falling for a human had already been done in ""The City of Angels"" with Nic Cage and Meg Ryan. Plus, I thought the idea was un-Biblical. However, after rewatching the film, and realizing the first film wasn't exactly Biblical, and that there was some slight Biblical basis for the mating of a human and an angel (see the word Nephilim), I was able to watch the film and enjoy it much more.

The film starts out building on the original film ""The Prophecy"" right away, as Gabriel (played excellently again by Christopher Walken) is cast out of Hell by Lucifer (not Viggo Mortensen this time around). So now Gabriel sets out to find another way to seal the Gates of Heaven from humans which means he must stop one of the good angels from mating with a human woman (Jennifer Beals) before it's too late.

The universe of `The Prophecy' films expands further in this one as during the course of the movie Gabriel encounters many new angels, including the Archangel Michael (Eric Roberts making a cameo), and a reinterpretation of a modern day Eden for fallen angels that are loyal to God to dwell in while fighting the war.

A great sequel to one of the best religious/sci-fi thrillers made. Top-notch acting and great storytelling makes this movie worth watching and sets up the 3rd film very nicely. Also, as a side note watch for an appearance by a not-so well known Brittany Murphy playing a goth chick who is forced into helping Gabriel.

Walken is still Walken and he has little to do here. Beals is too constipated in her role. Wong needs to speak up more and learn to act and Brittany Murphy as Izzy and Eric Roberts as the angel Michael are wasted in small roles. Tries too hard and turns way too sour.

916483,5,6304707045,"Think you would want to actually meet an angel? As this film points out, angels always had one wing dipped in blood. For whenever God needed a people, a city, a nation to be chastised- he sent angels to do the killing. The angels in this film, both in terms of quality of acting and special effects are very, very believable.
Another thing that sets this film apart is it's theological and metaphysical sophistication. A very good case is made for a second war in heaven. This is because when God bestowed his Grace, his holy spark, unto humans, he raised them up above the angels. Some angels, like Gabriel, just couldn't stand being made second to ""a bunch of talking monkeys.""
In this sequel, Gabriel returns to earth. This is due to the fact, as Lucifer states early in the film, Hell isn't big enough for both of them. However, this time instead of searching for the one perfect Dark Soul to turn the tide of the heavenly war, he is searching for the new Nephilim, a child of the union of angel and mortal, heaven and earth. Such a being would have the power of an angel combined with the free will and divine spark of a human.
Oh yes, you also get more of the humerous"" scenes of Gabriel intercepting the souls of suicides to serve as his helpers. In this case it is a goth girl named Iggy. I don't know why this should be so funny, but it is....
I couldn't think of an actor other than Christopher Walken who could have pulled off this role- who could believable be opposed to the forces of heaven and hell. You actually believe that he would burn down heaven to make his point....
All-in-all, I would say that this is one of those rare sequels that is as good as the original. My only complaint is with the sound levels. Much of the dialog is barely above a whisper. If you boost your sound loud enough to hear it clearly, then you get blasted out of the house by the action sequences.",1051660800,46,1893,4.335211267605634
916484,2,6304707045,"I loved the first film in the series. I did not care for this film. It didn't have enough fresh ideas, and some of the new ideas were just stupid. The main problem was with the cast's talent, or lack thereof. The first one in the series had a great cast all-around. But, in most returning roles, new faces replaced the original actors. I guess the originals from the first film weren't interested in being in a strait-to-video release.
  The Prophecy 2 has one big thing going for it, and that is the scenes between Christopher Walken and Brittany Murphy. Walken is his naturally creepy self in these scenes. Brittany Murphy, as the Goth Girl ""Izzie"", shows that she can hold her own in scenes with big-time actors (as she did three years later in ""Don't Say a Word"").
  I think the film is well-worth viewing just to see those two opposite each other. But still, only for fans of the first film, or if you're a Christopher Walken or Brittany Murphy fan.",1050537600,3,954,4.497109826589595
916485,4,6304707045,"I don't know what it is about Christopher Walkern that makes my flesh creep (no offence Mr. Walkern - I put it down to your acting skill). The story is based on a second war in heaven... this time, it's not ""Old Nick"" being cast down but all the good guys getting jarred with god coz he's let people into heaven and they already have a priviledge - a soul - which Angels don't have. So they (rightfully) feel snubbed that having given god a monumental headache since creation, he has now elevated them above his loyal and unquestioning servants.
There is a single soul which is blacker than all the others, and a lot of the angels want it in order to become immortal... the hunt is on!
Lots of nice spins on legend stuff... I particularly like the bit where Gabriel is reasoning with a human that he (as a - now - brutal self-serving assasin) has a right to be mentally ruined having spent eternity with ""one wing dipped in blood"". The murdering of men, women & children, done at the order of god without question has taken it's toll on them.
Quite jumpy in places, not as scarey as the Omen(s) or other top-line legend-horrors but a good story none-the-less",1020211200,4,1158,4.41588785046729
916568,1,6304707045,"This thing reminds me of the third Highlander; it even had the requisite sex scene at the most cliched moment. The Prophecy was original enough to not even need a romantic relationship. Walken and the autopsy guy are in this, but the rest of the original cast isn't...including Viggo Mortensen's totally awesome Lucifer, now played by some second rate actor...actually, everyone else in this is second rate. They also overuse the cool ideas from the first like the perching, the kissing two fingers thing, Gabriel's ""shoosh"" with a finger under their nose, etc, so that it feels like a bad TV series adaptation. The dynamic range of the sound is really wanky too, probably the reason that Sci-Fi and Horror Academy liked it so much. Geeky horror guys always like really loud sfx compared to dialog. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing since I spent [money] to rent it. Prophecy III could only be more of the same. Wow, I just remembered something I liked: the gothy girl and Walken's dialog was kinda entertaining, but that's it.",1019433600,2,1040,4.751381215469613
916569,5,6304707045,"Previous reviews have already mentioned the great casting of Christopher Walken.  His attempts to function in an unfamiliar human world provide moments of humor in the film.
Contrary to the previous reviewer's opinion, this film has a more coherent plot than the first and third installments of the Prophecy series, and contains some truly artistic and memorable scenes, particularly the conclusion of Jennifer Beal's confrontation with Walken, and Russell Wong revealing the full glory of his angelic nature to Beals.  Much of what makes these scenes and others like them work is the high calibre acting.  It is surprising that this film went straight to video considering its quality.  It is certainly better than the first.",1004486400,6,726,5.232758620689655
916570,1,6304707045,"This sequel makes the Revenge of the Nerds series seem well written. The Prophecy was an interesting film and one of the most interesting scenes was of course, the climax of the film. In the final scene, the devil eats the heart of Christopher Walken's character and drags him to hell. Let me repeat that, he eats his heart. So how in the hell (and pardon the pun) is it even remotely possible that Christopher Walken is back for the sequel? I expect this sort of ""he was decapitated, but we froze his body and brought him back"" plot twist from a Soap Opera, but come on Walken. What were you thinking?",990576000,3,602,4.383928571428571
916571,4,6304707045,"I can't be too hard on this film.  It's the best straight-to-video sequel I've seen, which admittedly isn't saying much, but you know.  The plot was actually imaginative, the cast tries their best & Walken is fantastic as always.  And the final scene turns out to be (unintentionally) funny, with the idea that the Garden of Eden is an oil refinery and angels are essentially just a bunch of crouching men.  Still, it's a pretty film, full of dreamy imagry and a wonderfully moody score.",986083200,,487,4.694117647058824
916572,2,6304707045,"This movie was very unpleasant for me to watch for about 80% of the time. Not enough Chris Walken! Isn't it supposed to be HIS movie? Well, that's what we're told, but instead we are forced to gag through scenes of terrible performances from very, VERY unintelligent characters, and laughable special effects. Take, for example, the fact that most death scenes involve someone falling on, or through, what afterwards appears to be a bloody stake. I can imagine someone bringing a box full of them to the set, or, more reasonably 20 of them. And most of the characters were SO annoying, I WANTED Gabriel to kill them. The only saving grace of this patchy, incoherent movie is of course Walken, who is indeed the king of creepiness (and gorgeousness I might add), and who's brilliant performance could have saved the movie if he were in more of the scenes. Another good point is Brittany Murphy, who hardly says a thing, and hardly has a character, but still manages to give a better performance then most of the cast.",978825600,3,1016,4.681564245810056

After the movie I thought, ""Wheres the walken?"", and ""Is that all  the walken you got?"" and, ""Theres more walken in a low fat muffin  than there is in this movie!""
The cast was terrible. The plot was  disjionted. It was a religoes film but without any of the cool religoes  imigry or dialog you get in other evil angel type movies.
The lighting  was terrible and the different factions of angels made things unreasonable  confusing. The fighting scenes took place in a darkened ally and i was left  wondering who was fighting who and who really won?
The female lead is  boring and unentertaining.
There were references to ""The  Prophesy"" however they had a different character playing the devil and  the cop from the first movie wasn't given a chance to show his talents in  the sequel.
Don't waste your time with this movie. It got one star for  having walken, and another star for the theme (the second war in heaven) It  gets zero stars for how walken and the theme were used.",949276800,3,1112,4.555555555555555
