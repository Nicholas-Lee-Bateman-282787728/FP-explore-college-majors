8222992,5,B000WE5GKI,"You do not have to be a fan of Joe Zawinul - or even know who the heck he is - to thoroughly enjoy this documentary. If you are a fan, this entire movie is one big goosebump.

Make sure to watch it on a Big screen, with Big sound.

During the performances, watch how JZ communicates with the others - but watch carefully, a lot of it is almost imperceptible.",1373328000,2,358,4.028169014084507
8222993,5,B000WE5GKI,"A great documentary on Zawinul, a master composer and synthesist and keyboard player. His sounds are so cool, he really figured out how to get warm natural sounds from a synthesizer. His playing on this DVD is amazing, and so is the band, the singing guitarist is remarkable. I saw him at Jazz Alley in 2006 and it was the best sounding show I'd ever heard in that club among the many I've heard.",1336348800,2,396,4.364864864864865
8222994,5,B000WE5GKI,"""Joe Zawinul: A Musical Portrait"" is a short, almost too short, look into the musical genius that is Joe Zawinul. As a musician, Zawinul was obsessed with, and succeeded in turning out melodies ""never heard before"" (from the lyrics of ""Can it be Done"" Weather Report's Domino Theory album). He even reconfigured one of his keyboards to have inverted scales (high notes on the left, instead of the right) so he won't be too familiar and start playing conventional chords and repeating phrasings he has already used before.

As a young pianist, already playing with jazz legends (Maynard Ferguson, Cannonball Adderley), he used to play like his heroes, especially Oscar Peterson. until Cannonball pulled him aside one day and told him to ""stop being ridiculous"", that he was good enough to play like himself, not somebody else. So in his own words, he dropped some acid, sat on his piano and from thereon never played anything he has played before.",1283212800,3,946,4.9125

8222996,5,B000WE5GKI,Outstanding portrait of the legendary Joe Zawinal. I did get to see him perform live in a intimate surroundings of a Jazz club that I went years back ago and never forgotten the high level of intensity he and his band shower me with. Well this DVD captures Joe essences. It is like bing at the Jazz club all over again. Please here this on a 5.1 system it's worth it!!!! Joe you will be missed but never forgotten,1206403200,6,413,4.2405063291139244
8222997,5,B000WE5GKI,This is one wonderful DVD. The sound of the band is amazing. What a gift to us all. Mr. Zawinuls thoughts and insight are a powerful experience.,1202515200,6,144,4.37037037037037
8222998,5,B000WE5GKI,"I'm a big Joe Z. fan, and fortunately got to see him perform with Zawinul Syndicate three nights in a row in October '06 in Washington, DC. It was a special weekend, and I'm sad he's gone. This dvd is great. You can't really say it's a full documentary of his career, but it does touch on the various phases of his career, and has great interview segments with him from just a few years ago, including a ""tour"" of Vienna apparently right when his new jazz club was opened. There's a pretty amazing segment where he shows his childhood residence (apartment building) and he describes the bombing of the town when he was 12 years old. The musical segments are all with the recent Zawinul Syndicate (not exactly the lineup I saw in 10/06), and I believe it's in the studio, but still is great, with all the players enjoying themselves. I definitely think you should buy this whether you're a long-time Joe Z. fan or are just trying to get more Zawinul-educated.",1196035200,14,958,4.511494252873563
