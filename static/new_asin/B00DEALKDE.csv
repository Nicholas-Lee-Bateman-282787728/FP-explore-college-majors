7621667,5,B00DEALKDE,This episode is hilarious!  I am now hooked to the show and can't wait to watch new episodes.,1288742400,2,93,4.166666666666667
7621668,4,B00DEALKDE,"Outsourced is a comedy from NBC about a manager for a novelty catalog company transferring to India to run a call center of misfits.  It deals mainly with how he is going to cope with the culture shock that he is experiencing and dealing with his employees in teaching them about America so that they can be better salesman.  I see a romantic relationship that will probably develop in later episodes.  Watching it on Amazon is so much better than on TV or even Hulu because there are no commercials, the cost is nominal, and the quality is excellent.  Hope this show survives at least a full season because I really enjoyed it.",1286150400,2,628,4.530973451327434
7621669,5,B00DEALKDE,"i have never laughed so much on any show's first episode, this truly made my day when i watched it. Unlike the other comedy shows out there, this show brings simplicity, diversity, experience, and combing all that makes this show watchable, absolutely brilliant. Can't wait for the other episodes to come. Love it, funny all the way.",1285718400,5,333,4.859649122807017

7621678,5,B00DEALKDE,"After re-watching this show recently (May 2016) I found myself again laughing out loud at the premise, characters, and story lines of the show. It has such chemistry between the actors and smart writing of sly jokes that you pick up on repeat viewings. I was sad to see it only last one season, but many of the story arcs are wrapped up by the end and you feel fulfilled at the ending. Also thanks to Amazon for making the HD version available as the initial physical media release was only on DVD (though the great DVD extras are missing from the streaming release).",1465689600,2,567,4.461538461538462

7621687,5,B00DEALKDE,"This was a great sitcom, very well written, and great production. I was very upset with NBC for cancelling it after one season; it simply had to be the commercial sponsors not liking advertising what they often do to make more money - outsource.",1436486400,,245,4.590909090909091
7621688,5,B00DEALKDE,One of the funniest shows ever made.  A true mystery why it only lasted a season.,1430870400,,81,4.0625

7621691,5,B00DEALKDE,"One of the funniest sitcoms I've ever seen. A spin off from the film of the same name ""Outsourced"". NBC network really got it wrong when they cancelled this series after just 1 season. Idiots! At least you can still watch every episode on the NBC app. Love every one of them. 5 stars!",1426636800,2,284,4.277777777777778
7621692,5,B00DEALKDE,One of the best comedy series ever. Having been involved in outsourcing it has an outrageously funny ring of truth about it and the problems involved in cultural clashes.,1425081600,,170,4.896551724137931
7621693,5,B00DEALKDE,"One of the funniest shows ever that never received the second chance or season that it deserved! I was really bummed out when it was cancelled. Besides Game of Thrones, this has been the only show that I felt was worth paying for and adding to my collection. The one positive is that it was a long season with 22 episodes to boast of! Each episode will have you laughing, guaranteed! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!",1423872000,,425,4.3924050632911396
7621694,5,B00DEALKDE,This one season NBC comedy series is still the funniest thing I have ever watched from network TV.,1417219200,,98,4.5
7621695,5,B00DEALKDE,"The show is very very funny. I brought the DVD and now I just brought HD version on AIV since it's on sell.
I'm Asian but not Indian. Since I came from another culture and I can understand the culture difference and how fun that conflict  could be in the show like this.
The show focus on Todd an american guy who goes to India and managed the call center. Throughout the time he got to know everyone and how he managed them and how the products they sold,topics like american holiday and Indian holidays, pop american culture and Indian culture, tradition, away from home, etc. It's presented in a funny way but reflect real life experiences.
And the reason I like the show is that how Indian people can be in such a show with contents that using their heritage and culture as a laughing material and not offended by it. I know it's American production. My culture is too serious about itself and would never make a show similar like this, especially by American's.
Anyhow, the show is really funny and worthy to spend money and time on. Too bad they didn't make a second season.",1416355200,,1080,4.454545454545454

7621698,5,B00DEALKDE,Bring this show back!!! Why in the world would it be canceled? Funny Funny Funny! Very  good show to watch,1404086400,,106,4.3
7621699,5,B00DEALKDE,"It much better than the movie, it is a shame that there is no second season. It is a funny way to show how important is culture in this globalize trend.",1388275200,,152,3.935483870967742
7621700,2,B00DEALKDE,"The movie ""Outsourced"" was wonderful!  This sitcom, however, is tedious.  It lacks the charm and vibrant feeling of the movie.  We found it hollow and predictable, with a much lower caliber of acting.",1373932800,,200,5.0
7621701,5,B00DEALKDE,"... it's a shame no one else thought so - it was cancelled after one season.

Based on the movie by the same name (which I also give 5 stars), it's a complete departure from the movie.

I'd categorize the movie as a romantic comedy/drama, but the series is definitely a sitcom.

Maybe it speaks directly only to those that have been in India (I have spend months there), but I see the humor, and it's good!",1372982400,,406,4.246753246753247
7621702,5,B00DEALKDE,"Outsourced is a hidden treasure.  I can say, in all honesty, that my spouse and I laughed many times during every single episode.  Honestly, is there any better recommendation than to say that you will have guaranteed laughs every time?

I think the reason this show didn't last was because people weren't sure if it was making fun of Indians or was being racist.  It isn't.  The shows successfully exploits the fact that most Americans, rich or poor, educated or ignorant, really don't actually know that much about India.  The show's main character, Todd, portrays this ignorance well.  Even when he is trying to be extra culturally sensitive, he sometimes sticks his foot in his mouth (naturally, to humorous consequence).  I think most of us can find at least a little bit of ourselves in Todd.

The show's exploration of the cultural divide between America and India is honest, understated, and, I felt, tasteful.  Such a backdrop sets the show apart from your more typical sitcom, while still offering enough story and romance to keep people interested.  I heartily recommend Outsourced for Americans, Indians, and everyone else.",1364515200,3,1135,5.016042780748663
7621703,5,B00DEALKDE,"I loved this show when it first aired in 2010. It's one of my faves of the sitcom genre. The only thing that I will say is that if you don't like cultural humor or sexual innuendo, I wouldn't watch this, as it will offend you. I don't see anything wrong with it. It's like a lot of other shows that deal with another culture, stereotypes are used humorously. But I think it's all in good fun.",1362787200,,392,4.103896103896104
7621704,5,B00DEALKDE,"This is a great show. Why do all the good shows get cancelled? This is one show that should not be missed,",1357689600,,106,3.8636363636363638

7621707,5,B00DEALKDE,I thought this was one of the wittiest and enjoyed shows to come along in a while.  I was disappointed to learn that it was being cancelled.  I really enjoyed it.  I laughed at something in every show.  I especially enjoy the guy who plays the manager.  The things he says and his facial expressions are hilarious to me.,1351036800,,320,4.3559322033898304
7621708,5,B00DEALKDE,"So sad this show only lasted the one season. We thought it was a pretty good ensemble cast, and were happy to find the whole first season online. Even though this onlne streaming purchase is listed as ""HD"", only a few episodes actually displayed in HD while streaming through our 2nd-generation Roku box. We have a high-speed ISP, and an ""excellent"" wireless connection between our router and the Roku box. We'd be hesitant to purchase another HD streaming product if there's a premium add-on cost.",1348185600,,498,4.870588235294117
7621709,5,B00DEALKDE,"Very disappointed NBC decided this show wasn't worthy of a second season. Guess not too many Americans were interested in expanding their cultural horizons,... at least the horizon the Outsourced writers were prepared to share, and thus this show wasn't the commercial ""success"" sponsors were willing to pay for.",1309737600,6,312,5.387755102040816
