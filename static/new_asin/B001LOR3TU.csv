3688331,4,B001LOR3TU,"What I like is that it teaches kids the importance of Easter in a fun and educational way. However, I wish they talked specifically about Jesus, rather than making indirect comments. I know that they got in trouble and can't be specifically religious anymore and focus on general life skills, but I just wish they were able to focus a little more on Christ's resurrection. With that said, it was still entertaining to watch as an adult. It also provided opportunities to discuss more after and talk about Jesus after. Pleased overall! :)",1493424000,,537,4.78494623655914

3688368,3,B001LOR3TU,"Does my child enjoy this movie? Yes, she does. To her, it's cute and funny, and she loves the little Hope character's accent. But to me, the message is incredibly offensive. The implication (well, it's actually SAID, not just implied) is that without the Christ sacrifice, without the Christian faith, there'd be no charity, no philanthropy, no love-thy-neighbor, no altruism, no acts of selflessness (and no orphanages, apparently). That part of the message is sickening, and dead wrong. Just a heads-up. You may want to pause the DVD at that point and explain to your wee impressionable child that long before there were Christians or Jews, there were people who were moral and compassionate, and today, there are atheists who are good, kind people, even though they don't celebrate Easter. *le sigh* Veggie Tales gets so much right, and so often... which is part of the reason this movie is so disappointing -- they got it wrong, big time.",1421971200,,942,4.930817610062893

3688378,3,B001LOR3TU,I always liked the animation up to Esther but the colors are not as bright & the characters look like plush toys. Interesting combination of A Christmas Carol & Resurrection Sunday . Its good to see Mr. Nezzer get a title role & the final song by Rebecca St. James was memorable.  I'm glad that the production crew didn't make Yeshua/Jesus into a vegetable. I like the tick tock song. First Veggie Tales to discuss death in a way kids do not have to become depressed.,1396569600,,467,4.430232558139535

3688384,3,B001LOR3TU,"I rented this as my little families Easter movie. Unlike other Veggie Tales movies this one didn't keep my 4 year old granddaughter's interest. It may have been the excitement of the day, but typically when she's watching something she enjoys she's able to tune ""everything"" else out.",1368230400,,284,4.9375
3688385,5,B001LOR3TU,"Always a great message about God and values presented to kids young and old in a manner that is fun, easy to follow, and captivating. So glad my kids ask to watch this wholesome show as so many are missing the mark about teaching morals, ethics, and plain good values.",1367366400,,268,4.38
3688386,5,B001LOR3TU,My grandchildren already owned the book and had read it over and over because they like it so much.  This DVD was a nice Easter surprise for their family!,1367107200,,154,4.310344827586207
3688387,1,B001LOR3TU,"A shoddy effort to graft the ""Christmas Carol"" plot onto Easter, the result is beyond believability even for a movie about computer animated, proselytizing, talking vegetables. The gulf between this and the average Veggie Tales outing is comparable to the gulf between the Kirk Cameron ""Left Behind"" movie and ""The Omen."" This is the Veggie Tales flick you would send to someone if you want to turn them off Veggie Tales for all time.

My five year old son watched, very confused, as to what was supposed to be going on. The plot wasn't convoluted, it was quite simple, but the premise was so absurdly stupid that someone from an age bracket that enjoys a fish in a rocket propelled spacesuit found it implausible. There were also continuity issues. For example, the young cumber is shown selling plastic Easter eggs in church, even though the factory didn't start making them until he was elderly and his grandmother had passed away. My five year old noticed this.

The ONLY redeemable scene was the elderly Scrooge Cucumber conning the inventor into building mechanical chickens. It was a decent homage to ""The Music Man."" I have a suspicion that sequence was the bulk of the pitch, and the flick was built around justifying it. That scene added a whole star to my rating.

Finally, the DVD has numerous issues with sound levels. The dialog was particularly problematic, necessitating multiple volume adjustments.

In short, if you know someone whose children you dislike and you have a grudge against the Veggie Tales franchise, this is the perfect passive-aggressive Easter present to send. The only down sides to using this abysmal sludge as a hostile gift is the children in the house are unlikely to watch it more than once and the DVD is too light to use as an effective Frisbee or skeet target.",1365984000,,1803,4.825242718446602
3688388,5,B001LOR3TU,Great my grandson loves the Veggie Tails and the Easter one is a great story. He watches it over and over.,1365724800,,106,4.095238095238095

We bought the Easter Carol for our son for Easter and were pretty disappointed that it wasn't quite as silly or clever as other Veggie Tales movies. It didn't hold my sons attention for long (which is quite unusual for a Veggie Tales movie). It is a great story with a great lesson just not what we had hoped for.,1335916800,,436,4.2023809523809526

I love how it puts a Charles Dickens twist into the plot by having Ebeneezer be visited by the 3 ghosts of Easter.  It is really important to teach kids that Easter is more than bunnies and plastic eggs. This video is a great tool to help accomplish just that.,1278547200,,424,4.158536585365853

3688414,5,B001LOR3TU,"An Easter Carol - Veggie Tales
An Easter Carol is one of the last Veggie movies that was produced under the Big Idea studio (as far as I can tell) and so it is one of the last that has a truly Christian theme.  More on that later.
An Easter Carol is a lot like. . .  you guessed it ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens.  With a few other comedic throw in's from other movies.  Mr Nezzer, Millward's (Larry) uncle is the owner of an egg making factory.  A plastic egg making factory (with plastic chickens who lay those eggs;)  ) Mr Nezzer believes that Easter is all about the eggs, and he is preparing to tear down the church to make an ""Easter Land"".  He is visited by his Grandma (who had passed away the year before) who told him he would have a visitor who would explain to him what he was doing wrong.  Hope (Rebecca St. James) is a little angel who takes him to the past, present and future.
The gospel is presented in the very end, mostly in a single song, but it is clear that Jesus is the reason for Easter and that He died on the cross for our sins.

A fun/short little movie about why we celebrate Easter.

** This is a review of a movie my kids got from Grandma and Grandpa this Easter, and has in no way been paid for by Big Idea's, Veggie Tales or anyone else who might have a connection to Veggie Tales

3688418,3,B001LOR3TU,"My family and I are great VeggieTales fans and we recently got this DVD for, of course, Easter.

We were all kind of underwhelmed. It just seems like whoever creates their music or lyrics was on vacation when this DVD was made. Nothing that really sticks with you or that you find yourself humming later in the day.

And I hate to be so critical, I feel guilty b/c these guys have made so much quality entertainment for children...but that's exactly why I have to say it...it's just not that great and way below the standard that they set years ago. ""Where's God When I'm S-s-s-scared?"", ""Madame Blueberry"", ""King George and the Ducky,"" these are fantastic. I wish this one had been up to par with these.

3688420,4,B001LOR3TU,"This video is fun.  It brings back ""Mr. Nezzer"" and this time, there is an Easter Egg/Easter Bunny factory.

My reason for giving it only 4 stars is that the song distorts the Bible verse from ""I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life"" to ""the way, the truth, and the LIGHT"" -- better for the rhymes, but it's not what Jesus said.  So I find myself in the position, each time we watch it, of hitting ""mute"" for that line and singing it the right way.  Slightly annoying.  But the kids love the show, so I have to recommend it, despite that one flaw.",1189382400,,546,4.113207547169812
3688421,4,B001LOR3TU,"Easter CArol is basically the story of Dicken's classic Christmas Carol, but adapted beautifully for Easter. The highlight of the show is the tear-jerking ballad sung by angelic ""Hope"" to a backdrop of stained glass pictorials of Jesus's life from birth to death to resurrection. I still cry every time I watch the tender scene.

My only complaint is the rather awkward emphasis by the Veggie-version of Marley's ghost--Grandma Nezzer--who makes a big point of saying that she is not a ghost, but a vision, then explaining how a vision is different. ""Hope"", the Veggie-version of all three ghosts of Christmas, also explains that she is not a ghost, but the ""Hope"" of Easter. It throws off the rhythm of the humor and story, and overall, seems more confusing to kids. I understand if some Christian denominations don't like the idea of ghosts--but it IS a fictional story; afterall, there's also no such thing as talking vegetables.

The Bright Idea meaning of Easter just for children!

As Hope, the music box angel takes old man Nezzer on a journey through his PAST, PRESENT, and FUTURE.  Nezzer realizes the significance of Easter, and how relevant hope is for people everywhere.

The only thing to watch out for on behalf of our very little ones is the slightly startling scene where the Grama is talking to her Scrooge-like grandson in his dream (since this tale IS in fact based on Dicken's ""Scrooge"") -- my three year old got a bit of a fright out of that part.  But since I'm firmly committed to watching any new movie right beside and with my kids the first time (at least) that they see it, I could hold him on my lap and explain the scene.

3688429,5,B001LOR3TU,"Ebenezer Nezzer is one of the richest vegetables in town. He owns half the town (including the town church), and runs his own egg factory, which was given to him by his grandmother right before she died. The town loved Grandma Nezzer, as did the chickens that were in her factory. But ever since Grandma died, the chickens slacked off, and Nezzer became a greedy loner. He is determined to make Grandma last forever, and replaces the chickens with plastic ones, the inevitable result of which is plastic eggs, so they will truly last this Easter. Ebby's perception of the true meaning of Easter is as hollow as his factory's plastic eggs.
Factory workers Cavis and Milword (Bob and Larry) are concerned about Nezzer's attitude, but they are more concerned about getting time off to attend the church's Easter service, and subsequent unveiling of the new stained glass window. When Ebby is paid a visit by the Reverend and his little boy, who invite him to church, Nezzer has a surprise for him instead; plans to replace the church with his own version of Easter, Easterland, in honor of Grandma's favorite holiday.
Everyone wants to stop him, but since he owns the property, they are powerless.

Nezzer is resolute; until the small music box on his mantle comes to life, turning into a musical, but somewhat feisty angel named Hope (voiced by Rebecca St. James). It's up to Hope to teach Nezzer the true meaning of the Hope of Easter - before it is too late!!
BAD: There's absolutely nothing bad about this film, except perhaps that younger kids who don't know better might be frightened by Grandma's appearance, protruding from the large painting of her above Nezzer's fireplace. (Grandma quickly explains that there's no such things as ghosts, it's just a vision)
GOOD: It's all good! The film actually deals with serious issues that aren't often explored in children's movies and films, such as life and death. But I think it's great that VeggieTales takes a very healthy approach to the whole thing, and gives a positive outlook on it, as well as the message of Hope.
THOUGHTS: VeggieTales keeps making advances and one-upping themselves, and An Easter Carol certainly does that. Great music (strange for the two guys who don't know how to read music!!), great teaching, great animation. The sequence wherein Hope demonstrates the story of Jesus for Nezzer via the stained glass windows of the church is absolutely gorgeous. I kept expecting her song to turn loud and raucous like some of her more contemporary ones, but it didn't. It really has given me a bit of a new appreciation for Easter.
It's also wonderful to see VeggieTales proclaim Jesus' name. While presenting awesome Biblical values, they've stopped short of mentioning his name in several of their features, but there's no more of that.
Among all the ideas and commercialism asserting that Easter is about bunnies, ribbons, and eggs, it's certainly wonderful to see the message of Easter, even if we've come to expect it from our friends at Big Idea.
Great buy, and a must have. Keep on the lookout for DVD Easter eggs!!",1081036800,,3089,4.839319470699433
3688430,5,B001LOR3TU,"AN EASTER CAROL is the first Veggie Tales sequel that I can recall. It takes place after THE STAR OF CHRISTMAS and includes all of the main characters from that Veggie Tale (though most are in smaller roles). AN EASTER CAROL is a spoof of Charles Dickens' beloved A CHRISTMAS CAROL. However, instead of a miser who loves money, AN EASTER CAROL presents us with a miserly pickle, Mr. Nezzar, who is so infatuated with Easter and making plastic Easter eggs that he wants to tear down the local church to build an amusement park called Easterland. He wants to do this to honor his deceased Grandma who loved Easter. But Nezzar has it all wrong and it takes a visit from his Grandma and a music box angel named Hope to set him straight. AN EASTER CAROL is a nice way to reunite the characters of THE STAR OF CHRISTMAS. It has some new original songs, including one sung by Rebecca St. James (who provides the voice of Hope). Overall, the video is a joy to watch and has a great message. I didn't like it quite as much as I liked THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JOE, but it's still quality Veggie Tale material.",1080345600,,1095,4.3463414634146345

Since I have been a fan of Veggie Tales since the begining my wife and I noticed the improvement in the animation not huge changes but subtle improvements that created an even better video. I do agree with another reviewer that the time concept with the past, present and future Easter's was difficult to follow. More time to develop that part of the story could have helped.  Theologically it is all good. I liked the correction by Nezzers Grandma that she was a vision and not a ghost.

This VT is like the Easter version of ""A Christmas Carol"". It is also the sequel 2 another VT, ""The Star of Christmas"". Ebenezer (sp?) Nezzar owns a factory of plastic eggs, which his Grandma started 113 years ago. Mr. Nezzar has the idea that if he keeps making Easter eggs, it's like his Grandma is still alive. So he plans to tear down St. Bart's church nearby, so he can build ""EasterLand"". The night before Easter, his Grandma apperars out of her portrait and sings a little song telling ""Ebby"" that he has Easter ""all backwards and upside down"". Later, an angel appears to Ebeneazer, to tell him what he has wrong.
This VT has great music, a great story, and an awesome silly song! (Not with Larry, but with Mr. Nezzar. See the chapter ""Boids"")
VT is fun for the whole family. Older kids (like 10 and up) will really appriciate the message, and ""Boids""! Younger kids will be cracking up at the funny scenes, and parents will be proud they chose such an awesome DVD 4 their kids!",1079654400,,1040,4.393782383419689

3688435,4,B001LOR3TU,"There's a lot to love about this DVD - it's got beautiful animation and beautiful music.  The angel, voiced by Rebecca St. James, is especially lovely, and her voice is gorgeous.  The mechanical chickens and the chicken rap are absolutely hysterical, and the story about Mrs. Nezzer, the Christian grandma, is extremely touching for both young and old.

However, in adapting it from Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" there are times when I thought the story dragged on a bit just for the sake of having ""parallels"" to the other story.  Easter Future was especially convoluted.  My 6yo couldn't understand why there could be no Easter just because there wasn't a pretty church nearby (""You don't need a church to believe in Jesus, right, Mommy?"")  It could have used some serious editing.

This is the most explicitly Christian of all the Veggie Tales videos thus far.  The other ones (Jonah, Josh and the Big Wall, The Ballad of Little Joe, Madame Blueberry) all could be said to fall under the general category of ""Judeo-Christian values"" or Barney-esque ""good morality tales,"" but this one makes explicit to children why belief in Jesus is so important and why Easter is such a joyous occasion.  The timing of this video couldn't be better, either.  I suspect a lot of little ones will get reminders about Mr. Nezzer when pining after chocolate bunnies this year. =)

Though it has some shortcomings, they are negligible in terms of its overall enjoyability, and it's definitely a beautiful video worth watching.",1077494400,,1510,4.928853754940712
3688436,5,B001LOR3TU,"Yes, there's no silly song :(
Yes, Bob and Larry take a back seat to Nezzar :(
But I must say this is such a solid piece of work for Big Idea, that I really can't complain. The music is excellent. The humor is very witty. The characters are very lovable. The only problem is my son just wants to see it over and over and over.
The best part of this video is that for the first time VeggieTales gives the whole Gospel message for kids. It's all here: Jesus birth, life, death, and resurrection! Unlike other VeggieTales which use Old Testament stories as a means to promote great virtues and morals, this video uses a fun story to promote the story of Jesus and the hope we receive from his victory over death. This video isn't branded ""Christian"" at the end with a single verse from Qwerty, rather it is thoroughly Christian through and through. The closest Big Idea got to this previously was with its Christmas videos--which rightly only focused on Jesus' birth.
This video truly rounds out the VeggieTales catalog. Neither the animation nor the theology could be any better. Although it coincides with the Star of Christmas video, I strongly disagree with the reviewer who says that you need to see that video first. Both of these videos work well as stand-alones...in fact, if I were to buy only one, this is the one of the two to buy.
p.s. Although the packaging refers to two animated shorts, they are nowhere to be found on the DVD. Since the Big Idea website does not refer to these shorts in their description of the product, I am guessing that they were removed from the DVD at the last minute.",1077494400,,1604,4.477815699658703
3688437,5,B001LOR3TU,"Ebenezer Nezzer has finally figured out his life's work.  Misinterpreting his grandmother's last words, he decides to destroy the church and build an Easter theme park full of egg hunts and chocolate bunnies in its place to keep Easter, and Grandma's memory, alive all year long.  Beside, church is just something that keeps people from buying his eggs on Easter morning.
But the night before Easter, he has a vision.  A music box angel named Hope (voiced by Rebecca St. James) shows him Easter past, present, and future.  Will it be enough to show him what his grandmother already knew?
This is a companion entry to THE STAR OF CHRISTMAS, using the same characters in the same rolls as before.  I've been looking forward to this episode ever since it was announced, and I certainly wasn't disappointed.  The story is fun and entertaining.  While we see little of Bob and Larry, their sub-plot is hilarious.  I especially love the scene with the seesaw.  The story goes beyond the true meaning of Easter to touch on what that means in the lives of Christians, something I truly appreciated.  At 49 minutes, this is longer then your average episode, but it never drags until after it's reached its explosive climax.  Several new songs add greatly to the enjoyment.  I especially loved their tribute to ""The Music Man"" and Rebecca St. James' song.
The DVD is exactly what we've come to expect from Big Idea.  The main feature is presented in full frame, with audio in your choice of stereo or full surround.  There's an audio commentary, behind the scenes features, and fun games and activities for the kids.  They even have a featurette on how real stained glass is made since stained glass windows play such an important part of the film.

Big Idea designed this to be the sequel because if your a Christian Christmas and Easter go hand and hand! I can't take credit for that because Mr. Vischer and Mr. Hodge said that on the commentary. I should've figured it tou because I am a Christian. Also, you kinda won't get the story without having seen The Star of Christmas first. I loved this. I watched it with my daughter and we laughed, we cried, and had a ball. Bob and Larry are at it again! The animation is phenomenal! WOW! Look out Disney, Here comes BIG IDEA! The story is great. It's perfectly portrayed and gets the biblical message of what Jesus has done for us and how we have hope in Celebrating Easter becaus of Jesus. So thankful that Rebecca St. James was Hope the Angel.

The events that led to Easter Sunday cannot be made to fit into the form of ""A Christmas Carol."" The plot of the fil is that a miserly man/vegetable runs a plastic Easter Egg factory and is focused on profits instead of the true meaning of Easter. However, the true meaning of Easter is not a focus of the film, which makes no sense, as the antagonist is openly anti-Easter, wants to tear down a church to accommodate the expansion of his egg factory, etc. There is a song in the move in which a stained glass window in a church is briefly focused on, and Jesus' sacrifice and rising from the dead is mentioned, but it is so fleeting, that it seemed like a aside.

I will admit I have only seen one other VeggieTales story, but I was under the impression the series focused on Biblical stories and the teaching of Jesus. This movie was a huge disappointment. Easter is the cornerstone of the Christian faith, and the fact that Jesus' death and resurrection is so briefly mentioned makes no sense.",1494115200,,1308,4.427385892116183
