6657210,4,B00NI4DO4E,"A quirky pair of stories, suitable for children and adults and based on the children's books by David Walliams. These are in the style of Roald Dahl and probably more suitable for pre-teens and adults.
Each unrelated story has a great cast of established British actors including David Walliams, Hugh Bonneville, Julia McKenzie, Miranda Hart, Joanna Lumley, Johnny Vegas, and Robbie Williams.",1417132800,7,392,5.338709677419355
6657211,5,B00NI4DO4E,"BBC A Very Funny Christmas might have a lot of shoppers wondering what the Christmas specials on this DVD are all about. Well first of all I'm thrilled that this DVD is being released here in the states since these specials were already available on DVD in the UK for sometime but those are (region 2)DVDs.
This DVD (region 1)contains two specials based on the children's books written by David Walliams
(And David Walliams plays a part in the film Mr. Stink as the prime minister pretty cool that he wrote the book and appears in the movie also!) I use the term children's books loosely because these are really great stories that have been turned into wonderful Holiday specials that the whole family can sit down and enjoy.
Mr. Stink aired first in the UK in 2012 and finally aired here in the US last year on select PBS stations.
Mr. Stink is about a homeless gentleman played by Downton Abbey Dad Hugh Bonneville,he is terrific here and his acting truly shines here even more then the hit well known show that he's most known for.
Chole is the young British schoolgirl who becomes friends with Mr. Stink and he changes her life and that of her family's for the better. This isn't the usual Christmas fair it isn't sappy,it spins a magic all it's own. At the end of the film it will touch your heart and You'll never want to let go of Mr. Stink or this DVD.
As for the second Christmas special included on this DVD Gangsta Granny I have not seen this special but I will be buying this DVD just because of the Mr. Stink Special
(Also a note for parents their is a scene where Mr. Stink is bathing in Chloe's family backyard pond instead of a bathtub no nudity is shown)Chloe's mum hands him a towel and tells Chloe to avert thine eyes before he steps out of the water.
I give this family film five stars and recommend it highly for holiday viewing during the Christmas season for all ages especially the young at heart.",1413158400,46,1922,4.416901408450705

6657219,1,B00NI4DO4E,"The wife bought this after seeing that Miranda Hart was in it... actually she's only in the second episode, the misleadingly titled ""Gangsta Granny."" Apparently the star of ""Mr. Stink"" is a Downton Abbey leading light. Never watched that, but I will say he appears to be quite an accomplished actor. I'm beating around the bush here... these two tales are NOT FUNNY and have the scantest Christmas references. Actually the second one has none. It may have been set in the winter but that's as far as it goes. Before you say anything, I am British. I appreciate dry humour. This wasn't dry, it was desiccated. This probably isn't the best sales pitch, but expect to see our copy in the Amazon used section very soon.",1420848000,,715,4.637795275590551
6657220,4,B00NI4DO4E,"A Very Funny Christmas  isn't a really funny movie but a  Christmas movie and nice to watch  don't know how they came up with the title,  should have been an English Christmas",1420761600,2,175,4.375
6657221,3,B00NI4DO4E,"Interesting.
With a title like ""A Very Funny Christmas,"" you're almost obligated to provide just that.  This DVD does not.
More importantly, this is not a movie; it consists of two unrelated TV shows originally broadcast on the BBC.  Of these two shows, only one (Mr. Stink) bothers to reference Christmas with a passing nod.  The rest of the show deals with a smelly man and his dog.  They are homeless due entirely to his having given up on life after the death of his wife.  He is annoyed and bothered by a guilt ridden girl driven to help him because he is the object of ridicule and she well understands that.  They form an uneasy friendship/alliance that barely alters either's circumstances.  This show goes from a confounding peculiarity to an unreasonable display of maudlin insensibility because someone must have remembered it was supposed to be a Christmas show and not a tale penned by the poor man's Roald Dahl (David Walliams).

As for the second show, Gangsta Granny (played by Julia McKenzie), it is entirely bereft of any mention of Christmas in sentiment or deed.  The story involves a boy who spends one Friday too many with his cabbage obsessed grandmother while his dopey parents scuttle off to ballroom dance the night away.  To hold his interest, Granny manipulates the boy into thinking she is a jewel thief.  He decides they should steal the crown jewels and plans the caper down to the minutest detail.........barring the unforeseen possibility of the queen (Joanna Lumley) showing up to try on the crown in the middle of the night.  Whether or not Granny is a jewel thief remains to be seen.  This episode does not end well for Granny.

Both shows are exceedingly odd.  Neither show is particularly amusing.  They held my interest only through sheer disbelief that they were even tackling some of these issues in this fashion.
(Humor is very subjective.)",1420156800,,1882,4.816199376947041

6657230,3,B00NI4DO4E,"I love British humor like ""As Time Goes By"" but cannot stand Benny Hill. Go figure. I did not find ""A Very Funny Christmas"" funny, at all. The acting, especially Hugh Bonneville, was very good. The story was even interesting. It just was not funny.

I expected a more traditional ""Happy Ending"" to a Christmas movie but the producers were probably keeping to the book as much as possible. I suspect that is the case, having not read the books myself. I can only comment on the movie and while it was entertaining, in spots, I just did not see the humor in it. It only cost me $11 but I do believe there are much better Christmas movies out there for $11 or less.",1417478400,4,662,4.296

8678385,2,B00NI4DO4E,"I'm giving this package deal two stars because it did make my wife and I laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. The 'funny' is all unintentional. If you want a hoot, where you talk to the movie the way theatre goers talked to ""Rocky Horror,"" then this is for you. Nothing believable happens in either of these contrived, forced stories. Normally, because we're big on the Christmas season, my wife and I will enjoy corny holiday movies because they capture and communicate the Christmas season. This is none of that. This is inept. I doubt that a bright eight-year-old would find any amusement here. ""Gangsta Granny"" is totally mis-titled (did the makers know the difference between the words 'gangsta' and 'gangster?') And, of course, there's the cop-out near the end that granny was never really a thief. The parents are so ridiculously drawn, obsessed as they are with ballroom dancing and oblivious to all else, but that's consistent with the one dimensionality of all the characters in both of these movies. Don't waste a penny of this nonsense unless you're going for camp in the extreme.",1447027200,,1093,4.850267379679145
