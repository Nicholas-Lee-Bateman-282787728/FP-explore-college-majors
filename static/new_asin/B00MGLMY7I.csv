6577233,4,B00MGLMY7I,"Set in a lonely farm in Quebec, TOM A LA FERME concerns the inner life of the eponymous central character (Xavier Dolan) mourning the death of his lover.  He goes to his lover's family's isolated farm for the funeral, and there encounters the mother (Lise Roy) and her other son (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), neither of whom were aware of the dead lover's sexuality.

The film concentrates on the gradual discovery by the family of their dead son's secret, and how it affects them.  Francis is both horrified yet strangely affected; as the action unfolds, he develops an unnatural affection for Tom that is both sadistic and sexual.  The mother seems to be unaware of what's happening around her, but perhaps she is just deliberately blinding herself to the truth as a means of self-protection.  Tom finds himself imprisoned at the farm; even when his close acquaintance Sarah (Evelyne Brochu) comes to visit, he cannot contrive an effective escape.

TOM A LA FERME concentrates on the ways in which people conceal their private inclinations, even from their nearest and dearest, and the damage that actually causes them.  This is especially true of Francis, who emerges from the film as a seriously disturbed character, masking his sexual inadequacies beneath a veil of strength.  Yet the process of self-discovery for all the characters is an enabling one - so much so that when Tom finally escapes from the farm, he does not appear very happy to have done so.  The film ends with a shot of him re-entering the city of Montreal, the lighted skyscrapers flashing by outside his car windows, with his face set in an expressionless gaze as he drives.  It seems that 'freedom' for him is nothing more than a form of imprisonment; by extension, therefore, his imprisonment at the farm was an opportunity to discover some form of freedom.

Filmed on a series of bleak winter days in stark, washed-out colors, TOM A LA FERME is a searing psychological examination of sexualities and how they are often willfully concealed.",1422489600,13,2011,4.902654867256637
6577234,3,B00MGLMY7I,"I was ready to really like this film. I even got the soundtrack before watching the film, and Gabriel Yared's music plays an important role on setting the suspense all over the film. However, while the film is beautifully photographed, professionally directed and the cast, including Dolan in the lead, is very talented, ""Tom at the Farm"" ended up being somewhat disappointing.

For some reason, Tom acts the way he does. I say for some reason because, why it is clear why he goes to the farm and remains there at the beginning of the film, there is absolutely no explanation as to why he stays longer than necessary. Tom endures and puts up with Francis' psychotic behavior, but it is never clear why. At some point, Francis tells Tom: ""I know you like me"", but Tom never shows any of this alleged liking. If this had been the case, that's all this film needed to make sense.

The only character whom I fully understood was Francis, who was very well portrayed by Pierre-Yves Cardinal. Halfway through the film, I stopped caring about Tom and showing interest in Francis, for, ironically, it was he the only one who made sense during the entire film. If anything, the film should have been called ""Francis at the Farm"", since he ends up stealing the spotlight in the film.

Had Tom made some sense as to why he behaved so unrealistically, ""Tom at the Farm"" would have been a great film. After all, it had everything a film needs to be a classic.",1416700800,11,1446,4.553846153846154
6577235,4,B00MGLMY7I,"This is the fourth film from `Enfant terrible' and excellent film maker Xavier Dolan (he has a new one in the pipeline too called `Mommy'). He has taken the play by Michel Marc Bouchrad and made it into a screen presentation in which he stars as the Tom in the title. The plot is that he goes to an isolated farm where his ex lover had come from. He has died and Tom is there for the funeral.

When he gets there he finds that no-one knows that he and the deceased were lovers and the mother, Agathe, thinks her son was straight and with a woman called Sara. Then Tom discovers the elder brother. This is Francis and he only wants to make his mother happy; this means forcing Tom to lie about his relationship and sexuality and help out on the farm. It soon becomes quite clear that Francis is a controlling bully with a penchant for using violence to get his own way.

This film has a good brooding quality and you know from early on that things are not even in the foothills of normal. Dolan is believable in the lead role but Pierre- Yves Cardinal as Francis is absolutely, frighteningly brilliant - a superb piece of casting. The film can seem a bit slow to start but as with all good things it does pay to wait and the plot does thicken to the point where it has an immediacy that makes this psychological thriller a very gripping watch indeed. Recommended for all fans of films that area bit left of centre - in French and a bit of English - one I can recommend.",1416614400,4,1468,4.239285714285714
6577236,5,B00MGLMY7I,"This film arrived today and I had it in the DVD player in twenty minutes. To think I grew up on a farm , am gay, a film lover as long as it wasn't made for twelve year olds or those who still are hooked on shoot em up bang, bang and am completely convinced that this thrilling touch of Hitchcock blended with the genius of a young Welles will have viewers on the edge of their seats provided they can read. The cinematography is stunning, the film score masterfully suited to the intense suspense , acting --remarkable by all. Of course the young director ,in his twenties , should knock the socks off the sophisticated viewer.  It is dangerous to be young and gifted. It carries with it a strange resistance to the wonderful by many in ivory towers who praise but ever so carefully with at least a tiny complaint  tossed in to demonstrate superiority . I'm 72 , well past such foolishness . We need to follow the man's work awarded by many abroad and a few here. I am so grateful I spent the bucks not really knowing if the DVD would play in the States. Clearly it did. Want to know just how deep fear of sexuality can be buried, how painful lost love can drive one forward, how destructive buried secrets haunt into the present? I  got Amazon's last copy at this time. They need to scourer the planet to find more. Don't miss the chance to view something chilling and remarkable.",1414195200,66,1381,4.344961240310077
6577237,5,B00MGLMY7I,Absolutely wonderful film. If you like Xavier Dolan's previous films then you definitely won't be disappointed in this one!,1414108800,3,123,5.526315789473684
6577238,4,B00MGLMY7I,Powerful over the top thriller my heart still beating double time.  The actors were incredible. This is a must see for all seeking a thriller.,1495238400,,142,4.68
6577239,3,B00MGLMY7I,"Xavier Dolan stars, directs, adapts, and probably carries a few more titles on this film that I'm not aware of. He's mostly talented in all of them. He's not casting himself as a strapping manly man in a way most actor vanity projects tend to go. He's no Steven Seagal. Dolan instead has a goofy martyr complex.

The basic plot is that a guy goes to the funeral of his boyfriend. Nobody in the dead man's family knew he was gay outside of his abusive brother. So, the grieving lead has to hide in plain sight despite being rather clearly homosexual. His name is Tom maybe alluding to Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley character. It has all of Highsmith's regular themes of false identities, constant threats of violence, sexually predatory behavior, and women as obstacles.

It's good dramatic material.  Dolan plays it as a dark comedy mixed with some thriller elements. He also keeps things mostly understated. The taste is a plus and a minus. The good is that he never devolves into sad preachy moments but the bad is that the thriller elements tend to be severely underplayed. It makes the film somewhat boring in that sense. Also, unfortunately, the film does what a lot of these kinds of stories do where secretly everyone is off sexually. It's not that such people don't exist or wouldn't gravitate towards each other. It's that surely someone in the group would be sane gay, straight, etc. The lead does some deeply creepy things in this movie but Dolan wants you to see him as this sacrificed saint enduring his ordeal. Except, he keeps it tasteful and I can't even enjoy some of the more obvious craziness.

The movie looks great. Dolan has a good eye for what makes a scene and pushes the vibe he wants. He makes up for a lot of his writing and acting faults with his direction. It's not that he's terrible at those but certainly his tastes aren't aligned with my own.

It's not a terrible movie but I'm glad I watched it on Amazon Prime for free. It's solidly average with some flashes of interesting and good material. I wouldn't warn anyone off but wouldn't recommend it either.",1492214400,4,2090,4.622641509433962

6577241,4,B00MGLMY7I,"If people are expecting a thriller they've come to the wrong film, but it is an excellent film and deserves to be seen on its own terms. Tom at the Farm is a gripping, creepy - and yes slow, but for a good reason - well-directed film featuring good performances from Xavier Dolan (also the director) and Lise Roy and an excellent, unforgettable performance from Pierre-Yves Cardinal who demonstrates how psychosis can be both terrifying and emotionally and sexually compelling. The photography is efficient, sometimes even beautiful, (though people may be put off by Dolan's decision to stay with a scene after the action has ended just long enough to make the viewer uncomfortable) and the soundtrack, which bears at times a not accidental resemblance to Bernard Herrman's scores for Hitchcock, builds tension while also underscoring the psychosexual dynamics of the situation Tom finds himself in at the farm.
I think many of us have been attracted to people we know are dangerous. This film explores how that happens. Not everyone will love this film (look at the comments: ""boring!"", ""stupid"", ""sucked""), but I found it fascinating and rewarding. I have some reservations: some of the plot towards the end seems insufficiently motivated - or rather, the motivation is there but needs to be shared with the audience so we don't get left behind at pivotal moments. And the introduction of the character Sara into the story adds little and muddies the ending. Otherwise, it is an exciting piece of filmmaking.",1488758400,5,1510,5.0199203187251

6577243,5,B00MGLMY7I,Suspenseful and at times wrenching. Mom is driven to insanity by her grief and it's uncomfortable to watch.  Wierdly sexual and brooding other brother is strangely appealing.  He's mean and altered.  For a while Tom seems intoxicated by him then he wises up after identifying with his intended fate in the form of a disfigured boy.  We quickly forget why Toms on the farm in the first place.  Well orchestrated story about isolated lives and the uncertainty of the unknown.,1486598400,,473,4.8625

6577255,4,B00MGLMY7I,"Tense, engrossing film by and starring Canadian wunderkind, Xavier Dolan. In some ways a traditional psychological thriller -- musical nods to Hitchcock -- different than his other films I've seen.  It was based on a stage play and co-written with the playwright. The usual visual panache you'd expect from Dolan, which is another way of saying you can't take your eyes off of the screen. The tension and growing homoerotic emotions between a young man from Montreal, who comes to his boyfriend's funeral deep into farm country, and his late boyfriend's brother ( a surprise to him) are intense and palpable and drive the story. Some wonderful almost absurdist moments, a great and totally unexpected dance (tango) scene. In the last part some of the transitions are confusing but I went with the flow of the story. The most confusing shot -- and I'd love if someone can explain it - was at the very end there's a cutaway shot to the brother sitting in a waiting room. It makes no sense for him to be there like that. And Tom does not respond with the fear you'd expect. Is it someone who just looks like the brother? It seemed deliberate and it confused me. Regardless, this is the third film I've seen by Dolan and he's a brilliant original filmmaker. I'd see anything by him.",1481587200,4,1278,4.654867256637168
6577256,4,B00MGLMY7I,"I'm glad I bought this one.  The central character is a young gay man, well played by Xavier Dolan.  I think this fellow is quite amazing.  In fact he also directed the movie and wrote the screenplay.
Tom at the Farm is a French Canadian psychological thriller.  It is creepy, tense and a bit sexy, yet it is also subtle and spellbinding in a way that makes me realize there is more to it than meets the eye.  So I will watch it again and again.  The closing credits are accompanied by Rufus Wainwrights ""Going to a Town"" which I think is very telling.  The more I think I understand Tom at the Farm, the more questions I have.",1480723200,,627,4.218487394957983

One can assume and make any psychological assumption and it will fit the story.  For example, I found this listed under lgbt, thus the entire movie I was thinking that the main characters were attracted to each other in that way (not necessarily).

6577323,5,B00MGLMY7I,"Regrettably, most reviews of this movie are, IMHO, way over-detailed and laden with unnecessary spoilers.  Really no need for all the tecchie caterwauling and story details (although it reflects just how the thing grabbed people).

My reaction to this movie, right from the opening scene was a slow and steady clenching of my stomach, with the esophagus joining in for emphasis.

The (spoiler alert) inclement, harsh autumn weather in the endless sea of knocked over corn fields right at the beginning don't exactly impart joy.  And when people begin appearing in the scenes, one just. never. knows. what to really anticipate.  Even after said people have been in multiple scenes, one never has any assurance of what the next scene will impart.  The feeling like the story was stuck on a track with a loaded freight train rushing towards it (with hints of flashes of said loaded freight train) robs the lips and tongue of moisture.  And you rilly, truly want to look away but your sandpaper-dry eyes can't pry themselves off the screen.

There's certainly enough hinting built in to make the viewer think they can anticipate the storyline threads.  And, surely as the story segue's into the last third, one has certainly discovered some truths about the characters, right?  And when the movie (mercifully?) ends, the delicious anxiety will dissipate as the conclusion sheds light on the whole shebang.  Right?  Right!?!?

The last spoiler is: the story isn't so abstract that you'll go on forever about 'meanings' of the plot, characters and ending.  Not forever, and not over all of them.  Because re-winding to ""watch that part again"" (and again) will surely clarify.  Unless it doesn't.  ;-)

Is Francis a 'closet' case; was his relationship with his younger brother (Tom's lover) possibly, incestuous? Apparently Tom & Francis enjoyed the S&M scene, verging on the sexsual for Tom has physical markings of same and seems alright with it! Also, is Tom & Francis acknowledging an attraction between them that might result in a relationship, the same as he had with Francis's brother? As one reviewer noted, Tom could not focus on 'escaping' from the bonds holding him on the farm and when he finally did 'escape' he did so with reluctance! Francis hints that he is a 30 year bach. that can't make it with women (although he tries to give the impression he is a stud and women find him attractive!) apparently something is lacking in this attraction which a woman cannot satisfy (gay?).

6577411,4,B00MGLMY7I,"While I wouldn't particularly label it as ""Hitchcockian"" it is definitely an intriguing psychological set piece. The basic ""boyfriend of dead lover goes to funeral and meets family"" genre takes a really dark turn. The acting is fantastic, particularly the leads - the mother is fantastic as she navigates among sorrow, anger, and complete confusion. Also in top form is the cinematography - the farm is bleak but various shots (especially some of the super-long shots) glow with light even as they increase the solitude of the farm and the Canadian countryside. The music is also gorgeous. So overall I really liked this movies and gave it 4 stars. However, there are several plot points that I had trouble with and felt as if the writers was ""creating"" a situation instead of letting events unfold. Perhaps my biggest ""What??"" moment (no plot spoiler here...) is at the very beginning when Tom, arriving at the family home, finds it locked, finds a key and LETS HIMSELF IN THE HOUSE. Was he looking to be shot as a burgular? Maybe that's the clue that he's unable to think through situations - instead he just reacts. There are several points along the way that force you to consider that the main character isn't as stable as you think he is (and that perhaps his lover, who you never see) wasn't the best of men. But if you let yourself get lost in the visuals, music, and fine acting - it's definitely worth a view. But don't expect Hitchcock...",1447459200,3,1449,4.686274509803922

6577473,5,B00MGLMY7I,"I believe this is Xavier Dolan's first film to be based on material not originally by our darling Wunderkind himself. As a result, it comes off as somewhat more mainstream than his previous movies. I won't belabor the plot other than to say it's a taut thriller, both psychologically and dramatically, involving Tom's (Dolan) deceased lover's sadistic brother's efforts to prevent him from revealing to the guy's mom that her son and Tom were a couple. Eventually the Tom/brother interaction morphs into a kind of sick love/hate relationship until Tom attempts to leave and the brother basically takes him prisoner.

Tension starts from the very first scene, both via the outstanding cinematography and the atmospheric musical score. Like the French film style that Dolan tends to emulate (he is French Canadian, after all--more about that later), the ending is ambiguous. We know Tom's final solution will result in some type of retaliation, we just don't know what or when (if that sounds vague, it's to avoid spoilers). The acting by every player, especially Dolan, is absolutely beyond reproach, extremely nuanced. As much as I loved Dolan's first film, ""I Killed My Mother"", which has been likened to a filmic ""Catcher in the Rye"", I would rank ""Tom at the Farm"" even higher.

My one complaint is that Dolan's commentary track is in French only. As I mentioned in my review of ""Heartbeats"", I've heard Monsieur Dolan speak perfect English, so there's little reason why he can't invest a couple of hours and also record the same commentary in English. If you're reading this Xavier, could you do me the favor next time? Merci beaucoup.",1443571200,2,1639,4.978102189781022

6577476,1,B00MGLMY7I,"I was so disappointed that I purchased this film and now is a part of my Amazon collection. I bought rather than renting because I had been such a fan of Dolan. His performance and directing in I Killed My Mother and directing in Laurence Anyway were abousolutely Stellar. I was and am so impressed by this young director, writer and actor and I thought his latest in Tom At the Farm would be a sure fire wonderful addition to the other two.
NOT THE CASE!
This is a disappointing predictable film that feels like an adult Children of the Corn. Boy(Dolan's character Tom) goes to lovers funeral at a farm. Meets dead boys brother. Dangerous obsession ensues while attemping t to pacify the brothers mother in coming to terms with her sons death. Brother is dangerous but boy stays obsessed with him and stays at the farm. The End.
Predictable Hollywood chase scenes through cornfields. Suspense in seeing if Dolans character Tom stays under his dead lovers brother spell which he does. So what. Yawn.
Theoretically this could have been a wonderful psychological film but there is absolutely no psychological layering of characters. All so mundanely one dimensional. Boring. Only finished because I owned it.
While Dolan's acting remains good, there is no texturing or depth of characters to make interesting and this is his fault as he chose to adapt this book, perhaps wrote the screenplay and directed this dreadful film.
Dolan is a rather cocky young fellow, nothing uncommon in the young and gifted and a character flaw that I saw nearly justifiable due to his talent. Hopefully this film will knock him down a peg or two so he can continue to produce the films he has the innate talent to create.
Watch I killed my Mother, the true gem of his work. Film transcends ""gay film"" it's a human film and those that transcend rigid genre restrictions are those that are true art and become classic works. I Killed My Mothee does this brilliantly. Tom at the Farm fails miserably.
Unless you are a diehard Dolan fan or if you just want what seems like a typical Hollywood one dimensional suspends Non-thriller except I French---don't waste your time or money with this film.

I admired the first third of the movie, the gray misty settings, the sense of solitude and foreboding. I thought the initial interactions with the mother were quite touching. When the psychotic brother entered the picture and Dolan's character went all Stockholm and then the phony girlfriend was summoned I lost interest in all the characters and the story.

6577481,3,B00MGLMY7I,"Canadian wunderkind Xavier Dolan's psycho-sexual thriller Tom at the Farm is an exercise in delayed gratification. Technically his fourth feature, preceding the visually bold and expressive Mommy (which was one of my top films of 2014), and the film melds Dolan's trademark artistic vigor with a moody, Hitchcockian style he's never attempted before. And yet fans of Dolan's work will no doubt appreciate that his core themes continue to resonate throughout, even if others may find the whole thing too strange to fully grasp.

The multi-talented Dolan writes, directs, and stars as gay ad exec Tom, who arrives at the titular farm for the funeral of his lover, Guillaume. From the moment he arrives at the empty farm it's a foreboding, unwelcoming place, and while not specifically stated it seems especially dangerous for someone like Tom. As captured by Dolan, the Canadian countryside is a rugged, harsh place that would chew up the effeminate, quiet Tom. Eventually he encounters his ex's maddeningly clueless mother, Agathe (Lise Roy), who has no idea her son was gay. However, Guillaume's menacing brother Francis (Pierre-Yves Cardinal) was well aware, and has been keeping his mother in the dark. Under the constant threat of violence he forces Tom to uphold the lie, even going so far as to invent a girlfriend for Guillaume, who Agathe takes perverse pleasure in hating and being obsessed with.

What unfolds is a twisted sadomasochistic bond that forms between Frances and Tom, with secrets emerging about both that shift our perspective on them. Tom comes across as someone desperate for connection; so needy of acceptance that he's willing to endure physical and emotional torment. While Frances blocks his attempts to leave at nearly every turn, Tom has plenty of other opportunities to escape and yet always finds a reason to stick around. Dolan builds the tension between the two by teasing something more than a twisted heterosexual relationship. Frances has demons on top of demons, with a current of self-loathing inflaming his frequent violent outbursts.

The sexually-charged undercurrent will invite many comparisons to the works of Patricia Highsmith, while the deliberately darkening mood invokes Hitchcock, but rest assured this is a Dolan film all the way. That extends to his shifting aspect ratios (previously seen in Mommy), and commentary on motherhood. Dolan has spent multiple films working through his mommy issues and this time he's feeling violently protective. Once again he gets strong performances from his cast, especially from the intimidating Cardinal, and Dolan gives Tom the necessary vulnerability. But we never learn much about any of the characters beyond their bizarre behavior. An explanation for what is going or, or at least some suggestion whether everyone is completely insane, is never forthcoming, making for a payoff that fails to reward our anticipation.",1441584000,2,2910,5.280777537796976

Dolan is great at set pieces; he can masterfully devise and shoot elaborately choreographed scenes that can be sublime or grotesque, sometimes both (i.e., the tango scene later in the film).  But he struggles here, as in all his films, to keep focused.  He fails to build suspense, despite the Hitchcock-esque score by Gabriel Yared (which is hardly subtle.)  And he adds absolutely nothing to the character.  In particular, his descent into madness in the second half of the film is hard to watch because it's played like he's just taken an Acting for Beginners course.  No nuance, just straight-into-madness.  The connective tissue of the film is problematic as well, since some scenes feel like they were shot after the fact and plopped in for continuity.  The last scene should be chilling, but (like much of the film) it feels flat and somewhat confused.",1440374400,5,929,4.8354430379746836

Xavier Dolan portrays Tom (I think he was involved in many aspects of this film) was spectacular and so was Pierre-Yves Cardinal as Francis, he was scary good too. I'll try to give a brief explanation, Tom's lover died, he wants to visit his lovers family and meets the mom who doesn't know her son was gay, along comes his lovers brother, Francis, who won't let Tom tell her and makes up a whole story of a girl. There is an odd relationship that develops between Tom and Francis, kind of a mental and physical control that Francis exerts over Tom. Scary how things evolve. Wonderful movie, I won't say anymore.",1424304000,8,790,4.455172413793103
6577496,4,B00MGLMY7I,"There are a lot of directors who try and replicate the great tension building aspects of legendary master Alfred Hitchcock.  In fact, Hitchcocks name has become synonymous with the thriller genre, and his knack for building said tension and creating such moody atmosphere and capitalizing on key moments has made many a director restless in their attempt to capture just a mere essence of his mastery.  Many have tried, many have failed, but every once in a while a film comes out that feels truly Hitchcockian, like a film the master himself would have made had he had the time, money and lack of censorship restraints.

Tom at the Farm is that kind of movie.

Xavier Dolan has made a real name for himself exploring the relationships between mothers and sons and the plight of the misunderstood gay man, and he fuses those two together in this rapturous thriller adapted from Michel Marc Bouchards stage play.  What he does here though, is make this film about so much more without making it feel like its about too much.  The explorations of grief, universally felt, and the decline into reckless and even obsessive abandon is so brilliantly fitted into the fabric of the film itself that the audience is almost blindsided by their existence.  Dolan has been accused of being melodramatic and too obvious in his progression of points, but here Dolan shows a very mature and very unique side to his filmmaking ability.  Nothing is forced, nothing is pushed too hard.  He shows incredible restraint in his dissection of themes, allowing everything unsaid to do most of the talking.

While not a perfect movie, Tom at the Farm shows Dolans incredible range as a director, and I hope that he pushes himself to explore, and perfect, this genre in the future.

The film opens with words being jotted down on what appears to be a napkin.  Those words, written by the grieving Tom, are for his deceased lovers funeral, for which he is traveling to the middle of nowhere.  His lover, Guillaume, never disclosed his sexual orientation to his mother, and so Tom is already on edge as he descends on the family farm, but soon after meeting Agathe, Guillaumes mother, Tom realizes hes in for more than he expected.  The presence of Francis, Guillaumes brother, looming over Tom as he sleeps, presents an outright antagonist, a man bent on preserving his familys reputation and his mothers memory of her dead son.  Francis is aware of just who Tom is, and he isn't ready to allow Tom to expose himself.  Forcing him into a lie, Franciss domineering presence begins to swallow Tom whole, consuming him almost, and soon he begins to sink into a way of life, a routine almost, that betrays everything he knows to be correct.

Tom at the Farm can, at times, feel a touch underdeveloped.  As I reflect on what Dolan did here, and the story that unfolded, I cant help but wish a few loose ends were tightened.  I am not familiar with the source material, and so Im not sure if this ambiguousness was what Bouchard intended, but there are aspects of this film I wish had a little more detail added to them.  This is especially felt in the films climax, which is sudden and tonally heightened to perfection and yet almost feels too abrupt, too thin.

Still, Tom at the Farm is a film that I feel takes some time to establish itself in ones memory.  My feelings for the film flittered around, changing and morphing and concluding and re-concluding so many times since I saw it last week.  While watching I was spellbound, when it ended I was confused, when I went to bed I was full of pondering and when I awoke I was smitten, completely.  Its a film that, as I said, works those themes in so fittingly and so delicately that one doesnt initially notice them, but as the pieces start to fall into place and time starts to pass, one starts to understand where Dolan was going with this.

Francis is one of the most compelling antagonists in film that Ive ever seen.  The use of sexuality as a ploy to flesh out a villain is not something new, but Dolan and his actor, Pierre-Yves Cardinal, develop something so richly textured and so intricately detailed that he feels like a completely new and remarkably original creation.  As Franciss mental state shows fractures and bouts of intense violence and unstable domination, the films atmosphere almost feels completely tied up in just WHO this man is.  In fact, Dolan uses Francis as a plot point almost as much as he uses him as a character, because it is through the development of this one character we see the themes presented take full shape.  As Francis exposes himself, ever so slightly (and in such fleeting moments) to Tom, we begin to see the full breadth of even Toms own sanity, and the deteriorating effect of Toms grief (haunting, and eventually destructive) begins to become evident.  Tom latches himself to Francis, a man who is brutal, controlling and abusive, and yet the rationalization in the fabric of the films scenes feels wholly believable just because of the way that Dolan and Cardinal build this one man.

The more I think about it, the more Im completely unnerved by it.

Dolans exploration of grief is an admirable one, for sure.  The film is unsettling and uncomfortable for all the right reasons, and it is anchored by a very capable ensemble and a very capable director.  The way that Dolan handles key moments (the tango scene, the mothers verbal attack on Sarah) show just the right amount of melodrama to sustain a tone while creating a true sense of heightened awareness.

After this, Id LOVE for Dolan to get his hands on some Highsmith, maybe an adaptation (a TRUE adaptation) of Strangers on a Train!",1423958400,22,5666,4.67741935483871

8672117,3,B00MGLMY7I,"I am pretty much convinced those who like Xavier Dolan films just want to sleep with him or be him. If he looked like Ash Christian, nobody would spend a minute unpacking his mostly ridiculous film library. I'm sure he believes himself to be this generations' Fassbinder, and it's bizarre how so many agree.

""Tom At The Farm"" is Dolan's attempt at campy horror, as his Tom ventures to the rural funeral for his dead lover and discovers a brother who was never mentioned to him, and a mother has never even heard of him. To call this family damaged would be understatting it. The mother is deeply in the dark about her dead sons' sexuality, and the brother threatens Tom into maintaining her ignorance. He takes it further by maniacly  coming onto Tom, somehow convincing him to stay at the farm, long after the funeral.

Is it a commentary about the power dynamics between a dominant and a submissive? A commentary about the lack of acceptance of gay people in rural Canada? Is it just an excuse for Dolan to make out with a hot French-Canadian guy in a cornfield? Maybe it's all three. Who the hell knows, because there doesn't seem to be a point to ""Tom At The Farm."" Multiple scenes make no sense, characters are introduced for no reason with no payoff, and the character of Tom bounces from moment to moment with almost no rhyme or reason. There are worse films than this one, but those who'll tell this is a masterpiece have their emperors' clothes on. At best, it bears resemblance to a car crash happening in slow motion.
