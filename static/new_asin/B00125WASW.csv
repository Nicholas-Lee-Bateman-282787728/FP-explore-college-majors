3077804,4,B00125WASW,"A reminder that unhappy, lost or lonely people can live without anger or despair, I want someone to eat cheese with is an unpretentious, flighty film. Do not expect fast action or even resolution. Just sit back and experience gentle humor and a respite from overly dramatic relationship movies.",1217030400,,294,5.020408163265306
3077805,1,B00125WASW,This movie starts off slow and you think it might get better  but it never does it felt like the movie just suck the life out of me. Comedy it is NOT you end up feeling sorry and depressed after the movie. If you want to feel sorry and depressed  this is your movie.,1215475200,8,266,3.9074074074074074
3077806,2,B00125WASW,"There isn't a lot of occasion to use the word ""twee"" these days. But that word, with its connotations of forced cuteness, does seem to fit this movie as a whole. Furthermore, each scene is like the movie's title - overly long and wandering, and ending with a weak-kneed preposition.

Jeff Garlin, costar of the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" TV comedy series, wrote and directed ""Cheese,"" apparently using the same improvisational techniques that Larry David uses to distinguish ""Curb."" However, the results here are the opposite of the loose-limbed, double-jointed results in ""Curb"" where everyone seems cocked to take a jab in an unexpected direction. Here we just end up with a rambling and lame series of unfortunate events. If you like ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" you probably won't like this - a wistful kite of a film that is simply let loose to rise into thin air.

Garlin uses the theme of ""Marty"" as the one hook that might have snagged the action. As he wanders through different Chicago settings, he tries to cast himself as a Marty character, an unpopular, somewhat unattractive (or so we are asked to presume) fellow, looking for love. He in fact hopes to audition for the lead in a re-make of Marty, the role he was born to play. However, even this promising theme ends in pointless improbability.

All the action here is too improbable to be funny or to allow us to identify with Garlin. For example, he shops at a large, surreally empty grocery store where the clerk/owner only stocks foods he likes - which means none of Garlin's favorite rice pudding goes on the shelves. In another scene, Garlin accompanies his would-be girlfriend as she strips bare in a boutique dressing room and tries on underwear. I don't know of any clothing store that would allow that. So again, the scene dissolves into ridiculous kookiness.

There's another moment where some edginess might have entered the picture - the moment when Garlin gets rejected by a young woman who had previously encouraged his affections. We might have gained some insight here into the games people play in their drive to exercise malicious power. But once more, this potential for something truer and deeper evaporates. The film cuts and disconnects to yet another wandering scene.

As a further disappointment, Garlin, who can be a colorful conversationalist, didn't provide any director's/writer's commentary on the DVD to help fill all these voids.

It all adds up to a lot of lost potential. The film could have been a chance to portray sweet, lovelorn yearnings - something the world needs to see again. In the end though, it's not so much about a man who wants someone to eat Swiss cheese with, as it's simply a slab of something full of holes.",1212969600,2,2716,4.83010752688172
3077807,3,B00125WASW,"The physical quality of the product was fine; however the movie itself was uncommonly bizarre, with a completely unsatisfying ending - not just in comparison to mainstream movies, but even to independent movie standards. The movie on the whole would be at least marginally worthwhile if not for the abrupt ending that makes the picture appear like the production team just ran out of money. I can't say I would recommend the picture.",1212364800,,433,4.945205479452055
3077808,3,B00125WASW,"An amiable, if uneventful movie. Plot: struggling actor James Aaron (Garlin) wanders Chicago looking for a breakthrough in his love life and his acting career. Along the way, we meet some of the offbeat characters in his world, including a convenience store clerk (Dan Castellaneta), his mom (Dina Kolb), and his niece's grade school teacher (Amy Sedaris). For those who have watched Garlin on Curb Your Enthusiasm, you'll see many of that show's actors here. Also, he has a fling with Sarah Silverman, a restaurant worker whose character doesn't do anything particularly funny. Garlin acts in the movie as he is, I think, in real life: a passive, likeable, sweet guy. Silverman acts as I think she is in real life: a smiling she-devil. Together, they don't have much chemistry, which is probably why Garlin doesn't go for the easy Hollywood ending.

I Want Someone doesn't try too hard, which might be its biggest problem. But it's likeable. It's like a nice walk down Michigan Avenue on a spring day with a good friend.  Nothing great happens, but nothing bad either.",1210896000,,1069,4.900552486187845
3077809,4,B00125WASW,"Like another reviewer noted, this is a modest effort, a small but thoughtful and satisfying movie, I wish there were more like it.  It's clearly a labor of love for all involved and Jeff Garlin has an ingratiating screen presence, sympathetic without being totally pathetic.  This movie makes some smart observations and manages some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments.  It's perfect for a night at home.",1210550400,3,408,5.059701492537314
3077810,2,B00125WASW,"Fans of Jeff Garlin will be curious to see how well he stands without comic support from Larry David and Susie Essman his best friend and wife respectively from the HBO series ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". The results are decidedly mixed.
While taking a ...(read more)much sweeter tone than ""Curb"", it tries to explore similar themes of failure of people to relate to each other in anything but superficial or selfish terms.
Garlin who wrote, directed, and co-produced this film could have benefited from rewriting many scense to make them seem more natural. Another round of edits could improve the pacing and flow of the movie, giving it a consistent rhythm.
While relying on many actors from ""Curb"" (Jeff's wife Marla Garlin is casting director for both) the film is unevenly cast .
Most the dialog is forced and unnatural. The actors appear to be reciting lines that have been memorized rather than internalized.
What a difference from the spontaneity of ""Curb"" where much of the dialogue has been improvised. The exception is when Sara Silverman appears as a freaky soda-jerk. Ms. Silverman brings much needed attitude and freshness to the movie.
In fact the only time the movie truly comes to life is in the convenience store scene in which Jeff and Sarah Silverman improvise dialogue between ordinary people who have a chance encounter in the ailses of the store.
So all in all, you''ll find ""Cheese"" rather bland than nutty, rather mild than strong.
This cheese could have used some aging.",1210291200,2,1491,4.920634920634921
3077811,1,B00125WASW,"I could not even finish watching this.  It was dry, slow moving, and pointless.  I watched for 50 minutes thinking that it would get better, no such luck.

3077812,4,B00125WASW,"Any movie that offers Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching, and comic actor Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut, a sad-sack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. Familiar as Larry David's manager Jeff on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curb-Your-Enthusiasm/dp/B000GEIRSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, Garlin plays James, a still-struggling, 39-year old Chicago actor who lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but he's a likable guy and it's the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving. If the storyline sounds a bit familiar, that's because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 Ernest Borgnine classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marty/dp/B00005AUKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marty</a>, about a lonely Bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother. In fact, Garlin uses&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marty/dp/B00005AUKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marty</a>&nbsp;as the play which James is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the character's situation.

Naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version, and Silverman plays Beth, an off-kilter, sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree. Their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles. Hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz saxophonist Ben Webster. They meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of first-graders, including his best friend Luca's pert daughter Penelope (played by Dakota Fanning's look-alike baby sister Elle). In a wedged-in cameo and looking quite a bit like Jerri Blank, Sedaris plays the school's counselor who speaks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a retirement home manager, and his scenes with Garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe. Almost stealing the movie is character actress Mina Kolb, who plays James' pixilated mother with pluck and heart.

There are also unexpected cameos from teen idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (don't ask...but the set-up is funny), as well as sharply played bits by director Paul Mazursky as the snaky director of a candid-camera-type show, ""Smear Job""; Tim Kazurinsky as the unsuspecting victim of that show; Roger Bart as the play's ignorant casting director; and Dan Castellaneta as the tough-love convenience store owner. With his rueful bouts of insecurity and self-loathing, Garlin's comic sensibilities resemble those of Albert Brooks, and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Modern-Romance/dp/B000C20VTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Modern Romance</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Defending-Your-Life/dp/B000056WRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Defending Your Life</a>. The one persistent problem I had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary. The problem is more evident in the first half when Garlin is trying to establish the right tempo, and the lack of real conflict adds to the sluggishness. Regardless, what he does well is capture that gnawing sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be, that a significant other may be out of reach, and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification.",1202256000,17,3983,6.110714285714286

3077815,4,B00125WASW,"Many people will be upset by this movie. Unlike most movies, it doesn't centralize around a single theme. It is a little like Napoleon Dynamite in that way. It is kind of a day-in-the-life kind of thing. It focuses on Jeff Garlin's career, his relationship with his mother, his friends, his love life, and his bad eating habits all equally. I was expecting it to focus all on his love life, so it's a breath of fresh air to see some variety. It is very dry, but I love dry movies and comedies. It plays a lot like a Christopher Guest movie.

For me Sarah Silverman made the movie. She dropped her potty mouth humor for this role and played a crazy, seductive ice cream lady. They have a confusing relationship, and what happens between them is hard to predict until the scene near in the end when he takes a taxi to her apartment. Without spoiling the plot, I will just say that the movie is realistic. No happily ever afters here (although it does end in a happy way). The movie doesn't exactly have an ending. There is no closure to life when you're 40, so there isn't one in the movie. It works well, but it could be better, because it leaves unanswered questions.",1355443200,,1167,4.377880184331797

3077818,3,B00125WASW,"***1/2

Sort of a fictionalized version of Kevin James or Drew Carey, James Aaron (played by Jeff Garlin of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" fame, who also wrote, produced and directed the film) is a portly, wisecracking actor/comedian who lives with his mother in Chicago, is a member of The Second City comedy troupe (probably the one bright spot in his life), and is seemingly destined never to meet the girl of his dreams - mainly due to his lifelong battle with food and weight (like many of his fellow human beings, he always seems to be on the verge of starting a brand-new diet, then finding reasons to renege on it).  James struggles to find decent roles for a man of his girth, and he feels he'd be perfect for the remake of ""Marty"" that a casting-director friend of his is currently at work on. On a personal level, all James really wants is to find a woman who will be able to look beyond his physical appearance and to see him for the good guy that he is - and, of course, to eat cheese with him (though he admits ice cream would be even better). In an effort to attain that goal, James hooks up with several women throughout the course of the film, including comedienne Sarah Silverman, who plays one of those flighty, free-thinking, free-spirited young women who seem to exist only in independent comedies.

Indeed, ""I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With"" has virtually all the hallmarks of the traditional indie comedy: minimal plotting; an emotionally detached, slightly cynical protagonist who makes wry observations on the world around him; a bevy of eccentric, offbeat secondary characters; countless ""in"" movie references; a droll tone. As such, the movie doesn't always seem as innovative and fresh as it might have had it arrived at the vanguard of this now over-tapped genre instead of the after-guard. That being said, there's much that is likable in the film, starting with the performances, which are all spot-on and amusing, and the writing, which is frequently insightful, offbeat and clever. James, with his body issues and inability to connect with that one special someone in his life, is an effective everyman character whom the audience can certainly relate to, and Garlin's low-keyed, understated approach to the role makes the character all the more appealing.",1293753600,,2282,4.831202046035806
3077819,3,B00125WASW,"An indie film that feels more like Sienfeld the movie. The main character Jeff Garlin plays an overweight comic who's life is on a slippery slope down. The movie takes place in Chicago, but feels more like its cameo city. There are a few laugh out loud moments from quirky characters, but no one really sticks around from beginning to end. Like a day in the life of a comic, he gets dumped, meets a slew of crazy characters, gets fired, and so on. Not much really to say about the movie, there's no real plot. This is more like a vehicle for Jeff Garlin to get more work, because he shows off accents, improv and other things (but not tap dancing).

This is supposedly a finding romance comedy and he never really finds romance so much as it finds him. It never felt like he was actually looking for love, instead they were just more quirky characters that made brief appearances or cameos.

Most of the time its just 2 people talking with no real action. Either talking and walking or just flat out talking. Good thing they take a walk through so many city streets. The movie never really feels like Chicago. There is only 1 scene from a famous location and when they play up Chicago so much, it would have been nice to see more of it.",1286496000,,1236,4.346320346320346
3077820,2,B00125WASW,"I love Sarah Silvermans comedy, but I am not about to rate this any higher then two just because she is in this. It's a dull and boring story of a fat guy who loses his girlfriend and realizes he just wants love. All while he has boring conversations with his mother, his friend and whatnot. He is a struggling actor and loses his job... along the way he meets a pretty girl in an ice cream shop who sleeps with him and and another woman who likes some album he liked.

Thats the whole damn plot... it sounds as boring as it really is. I think I laughed, or should say, kinda lightly chuckles maybe 2 or 3 times during the whole movie. And the ending of the whole thing is just terrible. It's a movie that is aiming at some kind of ""comedians showing they have a heart"" but fails to bring somewhat of an interesting story to this drawn out snore fest of nothingness.",1271548800,2,866,4.18562874251497
3077821,4,B00125WASW,"I am always amazed at how well good dialogue can carry an otherwise familiar theme in a film. 'I Want Someone To Eat Cheese With' is just such a movie. The film is about an overweight man who wants to find his soul mate. He comes across several quirky characters and it is his encounters and the witty dialogue that keep this film rolling along. It's an amusing and sweet tale, but it does seem to end rather abruptly and may not fully satisfy every viewer. I kind of liked it for being different.",1265155200,2,497,4.297872340425532
3077822,1,B00125WASW,"I can't imagine why anyone would say anything positive about this self-indulgent drivel by Jeff Garlin.  Not at all funny, it is incomprehensible how he was able to get so many talented performers to completely waste their talents on this terrible film.  Contrary to the review quotes on the DVD cover, this film was the complete opposite of ""hilarious"" and ""sweet.""  This is the story of a fat, unattractive man who whines through life and makes poor choices.  None of his various encounters are at all humorous - just boring.  I am just annoyed that I was tricked by reviewer comments into thinking that somehow the film was going to get better or redeem itself at the end, which never happened.",1263600000,4,697,4.7272727272727275
3077823,3,B00125WASW,Not a great movie. They suck you in with the Sarah Silverman name but she's hardly in it and the movie had a terrible plot. Was a middle of the road movie...wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Have already given it to the library for a donation.,1258329600,,242,4.282608695652174
3077824,4,B00125WASW,"Nice, sweet independent movie by Jeff Garlin (written/directed/starred). I guess he's a regular on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm', but I haven't seen that show. Here he plays a lovable comedian who lives in Chicago (with his mom) and performs regularly as part of the Second City troupe. He's also looking for love (maybe with the wild Sarah Silverman? maybe with milder Bonnie Hunt?), and trying to figure out what's next in his life.

Reminds me a lot of the John Candy movie 'Only The Lonely', which I also liked a lot. This isn't a movie that's gonna change your life, but you won't regret the 90 minutes you give to it. Oh, almost forgot - there are a lot of references in this film to 'Marty', and old movie with Ernest Borgnine. Unfortunately I've never seen it, so I don't get all the in-jokes. I'll have to check it out some time...",1242518400,,833,4.516556291390729
3077825,5,B00125WASW,"This film is refreshing. I discovered it in previews on another dvd.
Just the title made me want to buy it. If you need to be slammed on the head with less than funny humor like a watermelon being tossed off a building than this film is perhaps not for you. It is subtle and perhaps too subtle for some but that's the charm. It's a quiet small film. There is more than enough need for films people find as I did this one by quirk of fate. Jeff Garlin worked hard to get 'I Want Someone To Eat Cheese With' made. I for one am amused and happy with the presentation. I especially like audio commentaries on films and this has a dandy one...one of the best I've run across. I even tried rice pudding because I enjoyed this film. I have spent many more dollars on films that have delivered much less entertainment.
Thanks Jeff.",1238284800,,823,4.248407643312102
3077826,5,B00125WASW,"The title and the synopsis on the DVD cover may make ""I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With"" sound like another lame rom-com, but it's far better than that. Having seen some episodes of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", and finding Jeff Garlin's character to be much more interesting than that of Larry David, I was curious enough to look further.

Quite often, said curiosity leads me to some real turkeys, but I'm pleased to say that isn't the case here. Though it gets off to a meandering slow start at first (which Garlin's character James explains is ""kind of like his life""); it's got a lot of heart, and in ways that stand up to and even improve with repeat viewing. That's all the more fortunate because it's rare.

Briefly, James is an overweight and out-of-work 39 year-old actor who lives with Mom as he sort of moseys his way thru life. The ""plot"" does not involve high drama; rather, it is a character study, or series of character studies, as James interacts with various people - store clerks, best friend, bosses, and potential love interests among them. OK; I know that doesn't sound very compelling, but nevertheless there is a great deal of humor and grace and wit in these interactions. It is NOT the usual eye-rolling, cliched stuff. Sarah Silverman is perfect as something of a she-devil soda-jerk. Bonnie Hunt as a school teacher and reputed ""chubby chaser"" is hilarious. Also, I very much enjoyed Amy Sedaris' brief appearance as the somewhat goofy counselor.

Additionally, I don't understand others' criticism of the way the movie ended, or those who labeled the film ""depressing"". I thought the ending was uplifting and most appropriate; a gentle coup de grace for Jeff Garlin's first effort. I hope there will be more.",1237248000,2,1732,4.785953177257525
3077827,2,B00125WASW,For his directorial debut Jeff Garlin tells an all too familiar story. The tale is of the shy and sensitive loner who is hopeless in his search for love. In Jeff's case the guy is a fat guy who still lives with his mom. Garlin is doing what many other writer/directors have done before which is writing themselves a sympathetic character and then casting a hot actress to fall for them and adore them. In the film Jeff has a strange hobby of going to the convenience store late at night and stocking up on his favorite junk foods. He lays on the hood of his car wishfully looking up at the stars as he stuffs his face with the fattening foods. He works for a hidden camera show that plays cruel jokes on it's unsuspecting marks. His heart isn't in it so one day he quits. In his spare time he performs with the legendary Second City in Chicago. (There are some fun cameos from Second City alums.) He enrolls in a support group for over eaters but he ends up walking out of his first meeting and heads to a nearby ice cream shop. Behind the counter is the beautiful Beth (Sarah Silverman). As a conversation starter she asks him sexually risque questions that catches him  off guard. He reads her forwardness as interest on her part. The two start hanging out together after Beth gets off work. On their first date they go for a walk in the park. After their walk they sit on some steps and talk about how lonely they are. There is a couple having a picnic who are feeding cheese to each other. Seeing this Beth tells Jeff that she wants someone to eat cheese with. After this touching moment she invites him to go underwear shopping with her. Silverman is very sexy and funny but her acting isn't as good as her stand up. This is her first romantic lead in a film as opposed to playing the sassy best friend in so many other movies. She makes the most of the opportunity and captures everything you could see yourself wanting in a woman like this. The romance between the two of them doesn't unfold as you would expect and it's  disappointing to watch how the Silverman character handles things. I thought this part of the film was too underdeveloped and that things ended abruptly. You don't much care for the Silverman character by the end either. That isn't her fault though it's Garlin's for not coming up with a better way to end things between Jeff and Beth. Perhaps he chose to go that route so that you would feel more sympathy for his character. Bonnie Hunt gets a lot of laughs as a kindergarten teacher who Garlin meets shortly after ending things with Beth. Garlin is an extremely likable and funny guy and this film has some clever writing on his part. There are some fun performances but just as the premise is familiar the film turns into another wistful story about a romance that didn't pan out.,1221696000,2,2812,4.416184971098266
3077828,4,B00125WASW,"In this off-kilter movie Jeff Garlin creates something special and different with a great supporting cast.

If you enjoyed movies such as, 'You, Me and Everyone We Know', 'Junebug', 'Mind The Gap' and even, 'Little Miss Sunshine' you might want to see, 'I Want Someone To Eat Cheese With'.

While it's more of a comedy than any of the afore-mentioned, it shares certain traits - an interest in regular people and their lives, wry observations about the rapport that familial relationships and old friendships are founded on and a quiet feeling of abundance, even when things are going 'wrong'.

Jeff Garlin's character, James, has many things happen to him, such as losing multiple jobs in what seems to be the space of a day, but I was stuck how the possibility of money problems or 'survival issues' never played any role in the story - which in this culture is quite refreshing. It was also interesting that, in the end, James found the answers to his 'problems' from within his own life. There were no dramatic additions to his life or convenient solutions. His lack of need to control allowed his life to sort itself out. Like 'Groundhog Day' I think this movie would be of interest to psychologists.

There were many times while watching that I laughed out loud. Mr. Garlin is excellent - I don't know if much acting was required and it doesn't matter because he's so likable being himself. He's supported by an equally competent cast, some familiar some not. The actress who plays his mom is particularly funny - but again, in an understated way.

Having read other reviews here I was frankly surprised at the reaction, or lack of, to this movie. All I can assume is that many people expected Mr. Garlin to appear in something exactly like 'Curb You Enthusiasm' or have seen 'The Dark Knight' too many times. It does have the subtle, observational wit of 'Curb' but not the outrageous situations and certainly not the high volume dialog.

Finally, I'd like to thank the reviewers who panned this movie, they've enabled me to buy the DVD in 'like new' condition for under $5.00.",1219104000,,2084,4.7272727272727275
3077829,3,B00125WASW,"I too have to agree with the reviewer who points out how cute Sarah Silverman is (admittedly a strong point that lead me to get the movie) - - in addition, how similar Jeff Garlin looks to George Wendt (not a factor in renting the movie... However, his acting in CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM was.)  Ergo... I got the film...

Although not well directed, the movie does have that Larry David/CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM style of quirky observational humor... and the film has a charm...  All in all, a nice film to watch one time, though not sure I'd want to see it over and over - - My guess is that had Garlin stuck to writing and acting and the script and cast were virtually the same, but a Christopher Guest or Woody Allenesque director were pulled in, it really would have worked...

As for the story, its about an aspiring actor/compulsive overeater who at age 39 still live with his mother...
His life is falling apart, until he meets Beth (Silverman's character)... a cheerfully yet somewhat mentally ill/sexually uninhibited chubby chaser who work's at her sister's ice cream parlor.  The film unfolds at its own pace, but is held together by Garlin, Silverman and company...  (Most interestingly, Garlin pretty much plays a character similar to the one in CURB, and Silverman is definitely herself, so fans of both will enjoy, though sometimes its a bit awkward.)

OK, now that I've gotten that off my chest, I'll admit I enjoyed ""I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With.""

""Cheese"" communicates in a very innocent, direct and quirky method, that is entirely endearing.  Its difficult not to develop some affection for Jeff Garlin.  This movie is essentially a ""stream of experience"" about Jeff's life as an nice, aimless, affable, funny, fat jewish guy.

Sarah Silverman delivers a performance that could (or will) be right out of ""The Sarah Silverman Program.""  Bonnie Hunt is wonderful as the school teacher, and Dan Castellaneta is great as the store owner.

I'm going to watch it again to make sure I don't miss any of the great humor, like when the homeless guy refuses to wear the pirate costume saying, ""I'm a homeless guy.  All I have left is my dignity.""

This would have been five stars, but as the movie begins to build toward what I thought might be the most important scenes, it suddenly ends.  Perhaps demonstrating my interest in the film, I felt ripped-off, like someone had just deleted a huge chunk somewhere in the second half of the DVD.  The last scene, which was supposed to be very meaningful, was probably set up by the missing material, so it just seemed to appear out of nowhere.

Its as if the producer of the movie, like Jeff Garlin's character, full of talented self-doubt, got off to a great start but suddenly loses his nerve just before closing the deal with the audience.

Still, you can't discount the good intentions and honesty of this little film.  Basically, Jeff is someone I'd like to meet, I think he'd be a lot of fun.

The writer, director, star has alot of very good friends who acted in and contributed the funds to produce this film. Don't expect entertainment, romance or comedy. The story is largely autobiographical and depressing. Sarah Silverman's character seduces and then dumps the protagonist. She was just curious because she had 'never made it with a fat guy'. I enjoyed the commentary much more than the film. There are many familiar faces among the cast and the acting is good. There was nothing lacking in the technical aspects of the film.

3312303,2,B00125WASW,"There isn't a lot of occasion to use the word ""twee"" these days. But that word, with its connotations of forced cuteness, does seem to fit this movie as a whole. Furthermore, each scene is like the movie's title - overly long and wandering, and ending with a weak-kneed preposition.

Jeff Garlin, costar of the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" TV comedy series, wrote and directed ""Cheese,"" apparently using the same improvisational techniques that Larry David uses to distinguish ""Curb."" However, the results here are the opposite of the loose-limbed, double-jointed results in ""Curb"" where everyone seems cocked to take a jab in an unexpected direction. Here we just end up with a rambling and lame series of unfortunate events. If you like ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" you probably won't like this - a wistful kite of a film that is simply let loose to rise into thin air.

Garlin uses the theme of ""Marty"" as the one hook that might have snagged the action. As he wanders through different Chicago settings, he tries to cast himself as a Marty character, an unpopular, somewhat unattractive (or so we are asked to presume) fellow, looking for love. He in fact hopes to audition for the lead in a re-make of Marty, the role he was born to play. However, even this promising theme ends in pointless improbability.

All the action here is too improbable to be funny or to allow us to identify with Garlin. For example, he shops at a large, surreally empty grocery store where the clerk/owner only stocks foods he likes - which means none of Garlin's favorite rice pudding goes on the shelves. In another scene, Garlin accompanies his would-be girlfriend as she strips bare in a boutique dressing room and tries on underwear. I don't know of any clothing store that would allow that. So again, the scene dissolves into ridiculous kookiness.

There's another moment where some edginess might have entered the picture - the moment when Garlin gets rejected by a young woman who had previously encouraged his affections. We might have gained some insight here into the games people play in their drive to exercise malicious power. But once more, this potential for something truer and deeper evaporates. The film cuts and disconnects to yet another wandering scene.

As a further disappointment, Garlin, who can be a colorful conversationalist, didn't provide any director's/writer's commentary on the DVD to help fill all these voids.

It all adds up to a lot of lost potential. The film could have been a chance to portray sweet, lovelorn yearnings - something the world needs to see again. In the end though, it's not so much about a man who wants someone to eat Swiss cheese with, as it's simply a slab of something full of holes.",1212969600,2,2716,4.83010752688172

For those who have watched Garlin on Curb Your Enthusiasm, you'll see many of that show's actors here. Also, he has a fling with Sarah Silverman, a restaurant worker whose character doesn't do anything particularly funny. Garlin acts in the movie as he is, I think, in real life: a passive, likeable, sweet guy. Silverman acts as I think she is in real life: a smiling she-devil. Together, they don't have much chemistry, which is probably why Garlin doesn't go for the easy Hollywood ending.

While taking a ...(read more)much sweeter tone than ""Curb"", it tries to explore similar themes of failure of people to relate to each other in anything but superficial or selfish terms.
Garlin who wrote, directed, and co-produced this film could have benefited from rewriting many scense to make them seem more natural. Another round of edits could improve the pacing and flow of the movie, giving it a consistent rhythm.
While relying on many actors from ""Curb"" (Jeff's wife Marla Garlin is casting director for both) the film is unevenly cast .
Most the dialog is forced and unnatural. The actors appear to be reciting lines that have been memorized rather than internalized.
What a difference from the spontaneity of ""Curb"" where much of the dialogue has been improvised. The exception is when Sara Silverman appears as a freaky soda-jerk. Ms. Silverman brings much needed attitude and freshness to the movie.
In fact the only time the movie truly comes to life is in the convenience store scene in which Jeff and Sarah Silverman improvise dialogue between ordinary people who have a chance encounter in the ailses of the store.

3312309,4,B00125WASW,"Any movie that offers Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching, and comic actor Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut, a sad-sack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. Familiar as Larry David's manager Jeff on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curb-Your-Enthusiasm/dp/B000GEIRSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, Garlin plays James, a still-struggling, 39-year old Chicago actor who lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but he's a likable guy and it's the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving. If the storyline sounds a bit familiar, that's because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 Ernest Borgnine classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marty/dp/B00005AUKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marty</a>, about a lonely Bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother.

Naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version, and Silverman plays Beth, an off-kilter, sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree. Their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles. Hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz saxophonist Ben Webster. They meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of first-graders, including his best friend Luca's pert daughter Penelope (played by Dakota Fanning's look-alike baby sister Elle). In a wedged-in cameo and looking quite a bit like Jerri Blank, Sedaris plays the school's counselor who speaks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a retirement home manager, and his scenes with Garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe. Almost stealing the movie is character actress Mina Kolb, who plays James' pixilated mother with pluck and heart.

There are also unexpected cameos from teen idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (don't ask...but the set-up is funny), as well as sharply played bits by director Paul Mazursky as the snaky director of a candid-camera-type show, ""Smear Job""; Tim Kazurinsky as the unsuspecting victim of that show; Roger Bart as the play's ignorant casting director; and Dan Castellaneta as the tough-love convenience store owner. With his rueful bouts of insecurity and self-loathing, Garlin's comic sensibilities resemble those of Albert Brooks, and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Modern-Romance/dp/B000C20VTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Modern Romance</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Defending-Your-Life/dp/B000056WRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Defending Your Life</a>. The one persistent problem I had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary. The problem is more evident in the first half when Garlin is trying to establish the right tempo, and the lack of real conflict adds to the sluggishness. Regardless, what he does well is capture that gnawing sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be, that a significant other may be out of reach, and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification.",1202256000,17,3983,6.110714285714286

I was expecting it to focus all on his love life, so it's a breath of fresh air to see some variety. It is very dry, but I love dry movies and comedies. It plays a lot like a Christopher Guest movie.

For me Sarah Silverman made the movie. She dropped her potty mouth humor for this role and played a crazy, seductive ice cream lady. They have a confusing relationship, and what happens between them is hard to predict until the scene near in the end when he takes a taxi to her apartment. Without spoiling the plot, I will just say that the movie is realistic. No happily ever afters here (although it does end in a happy way). The movie doesn't exactly have an ending.

Sort of a fictionalized version of Kevin James or Drew Carey, James Aaron (played by Jeff Garlin of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" fame, who also wrote, produced and directed the film) is a portly, wisecracking actor/comedian who lives with his mother in Chicago, is a member of The Second City comedy troupe (probably the one bright spot in his life), and is seemingly destined never to meet the girl of his dreams - mainly due to his lifelong battle with food and weight (like many of his fellow human beings, he always seems to be on the verge of starting a brand-new diet, then finding reasons to renege on it).  James struggles to find decent roles for a man of his girth, and he feels he'd be perfect for the remake of ""Marty"" that a casting-director friend of his is currently at work on. On a personal level, all James really wants is to find a woman who will be able to look beyond his physical appearance and to see him for the good guy that he is - and, of course, to eat cheese with him (though he admits ice cream would be even better). In an effort to attain that goal, James hooks up with several women throughout the course of the film, including comedienne Sarah Silverman, who plays one of those flighty, free-thinking, free-spirited young women who seem to exist only in independent comedies.

Indeed, ""I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With"" has virtually all the hallmarks of the traditional indie comedy: minimal plotting; an emotionally detached, slightly cynical protagonist who makes wry observations on the world around him; a bevy of eccentric, offbeat secondary characters; countless ""in"" movie references; a droll tone. As such, the movie doesn't always seem as innovative and fresh as it might have had it arrived at the vanguard of this now over-tapped genre instead of the after-guard. That being said, there's much that is likable in the film, starting with the performances, which are all spot-on and amusing, and the writing, which is frequently insightful, offbeat and clever. James, with his body issues and inability to connect with that one special someone in his life, is an effective everyman character whom the audience can certainly relate to, and Garlin's low-keyed, understated approach to the role makes the character all the more appealing.",1293753600,,2282,4.831202046035806

Like a day in the life of a comic, he gets dumped, meets a slew of crazy characters, gets fired, and so on. Not much really to say about the movie, there's no real plot. This is more like a vehicle for Jeff Garlin to get more work, because he shows off accents, improv and other things (but not tap dancing).

This is supposedly a finding romance comedy and he never really finds romance so much as it finds him. It never felt like he was actually looking for love, instead they were just more quirky characters that made brief appearances or cameos.

Most of the time its just 2 people talking with no real action. Either talking and walking or just flat out talking. Good thing they take a walk through so many city streets.

3312323,5,B00125WASW,"The title and the synopsis on the DVD cover may make ""I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With"" sound like another lame rom-com, but it's far better than that. Having seen some episodes of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", and finding Jeff Garlin's character to be much more interesting than that of Larry David, I was curious enough to look further.

Quite often, said curiosity leads me to some real turkeys, but I'm pleased to say that isn't the case here. Though it gets off to a meandering slow start at first (which Garlin's character James explains is ""kind of like his life""); it's got a lot of heart, and in ways that stand up to and even improve with repeat viewing. That's all the more fortunate because it's rare.

Briefly, James is an overweight and out-of-work 39 year-old actor who lives with Mom as he sort of moseys his way thru life. The ""plot"" does not involve high drama; rather, it is a character study, or series of character studies, as James interacts with various people - store clerks, best friend, bosses, and potential love interests among them. OK; I know that doesn't sound very compelling, but nevertheless there is a great deal of humor and grace and wit in these interactions. It is NOT the usual eye-rolling, cliched stuff. Sarah Silverman is perfect as something of a she-devil soda-jerk. Bonnie Hunt as a school teacher and reputed ""chubby chaser"" is hilarious. Also, I very much enjoyed Amy Sedaris' brief appearance as the somewhat goofy counselor.

Additionally, I don't understand others' criticism of the way the movie ended, or those who labeled the film ""depressing"". I thought the ending was uplifting and most appropriate; a gentle coup de grace for Jeff Garlin's first effort. I hope there will be more.",1237248000,2,1732,4.785953177257525
3312324,2,B00125WASW,For his directorial debut Jeff Garlin tells an all too familiar story. The tale is of the shy and sensitive loner who is hopeless in his search for love. In Jeff's case the guy is a fat guy who still lives with his mom. Garlin is doing what many other writer/directors have done before which is writing themselves a sympathetic character and then casting a hot actress to fall for them and adore them. In the film Jeff has a strange hobby of going to the convenience store late at night and stocking up on his favorite junk foods. He lays on the hood of his car wishfully looking up at the stars as he stuffs his face with the fattening foods. He works for a hidden camera show that plays cruel jokes on it's unsuspecting marks. His heart isn't in it so one day he quits. In his spare time he performs with the legendary Second City in Chicago. (There are some fun cameos from Second City alums.) He enrolls in a support group for over eaters but he ends up walking out of his first meeting and heads to a nearby ice cream shop. Behind the counter is the beautiful Beth (Sarah Silverman). As a conversation starter she asks him sexually risque questions that catches him  off guard. He reads her forwardness as interest on her part. The two start hanging out together after Beth gets off work. On their first date they go for a walk in the park. After their walk they sit on some steps and talk about how lonely they are. There is a couple having a picnic who are feeding cheese to each other. Seeing this Beth tells Jeff that she wants someone to eat cheese with. After this touching moment she invites him to go underwear shopping with her. Silverman is very sexy and funny but her acting isn't as good as her stand up. This is her first romantic lead in a film as opposed to playing the sassy best friend in so many other movies. She makes the most of the opportunity and captures everything you could see yourself wanting in a woman like this. The romance between the two of them doesn't unfold as you would expect and it's  disappointing to watch how the Silverman character handles things. I thought this part of the film was too underdeveloped and that things ended abruptly. You don't much care for the Silverman character by the end either. That isn't her fault though it's Garlin's for not coming up with a better way to end things between Jeff and Beth. Perhaps he chose to go that route so that you would feel more sympathy for his character. Bonnie Hunt gets a lot of laughs as a kindergarten teacher who Garlin meets shortly after ending things with Beth. Garlin is an extremely likable and funny guy and this film has some clever writing on his part. There are some fun performances but just as the premise is familiar the film turns into another wistful story about a romance that didn't pan out.,1221696000,2,2812,4.416184971098266

If you enjoyed movies such as, 'You, Me and Everyone We Know', 'Junebug', 'Mind The Gap' and even, 'Little Miss Sunshine' you might want to see, 'I Want Someone To Eat Cheese With'.

While it's more of a comedy than any of the afore-mentioned, it shares certain traits - an interest in regular people and their lives, wry observations about the rapport that familial relationships and old friendships are founded on and a quiet feeling of abundance, even when things are going 'wrong'.

Jeff Garlin's character, James, has many things happen to him, such as losing multiple jobs in what seems to be the space of a day, but I was stuck how the possibility of money problems or 'survival issues' never played any role in the story - which in this culture is quite refreshing. It was also interesting that, in the end, James found the answers to his 'problems' from within his own life. There were no dramatic additions to his life or convenient solutions. His lack of need to control allowed his life to sort itself out. Like 'Groundhog Day' I think this movie would be of interest to psychologists.

There were many times while watching that I laughed out loud. Mr. Garlin is excellent - I don't know if much acting was required and it doesn't matter because he's so likable being himself. He's supported by an equally competent cast, some familiar some not. The actress who plays his mom is particularly funny - but again, in an understated way.

Having read other reviews here I was frankly surprised at the reaction, or lack of, to this movie. All I can assume is that many people expected Mr. Garlin to appear in something exactly like 'Curb You Enthusiasm' or have seen 'The Dark Knight' too many times. It does have the subtle, observational wit of 'Curb' but not the outrageous situations and certainly not the high volume dialog.

Finally, I'd like to thank the reviewers who panned this movie, they've enabled me to buy the DVD in 'like new' condition for under $5.00.",1219104000,,2084,4.7272727272727275
3312326,3,B00125WASW,"I too have to agree with the reviewer who points out how cute Sarah Silverman is (admittedly a strong point that lead me to get the movie) - - in addition, how similar Jeff Garlin looks to George Wendt (not a factor in renting the movie... However, his acting in CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM was.)  Ergo... I got the film...

Although not well directed, the movie does have that Larry David/CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM style of quirky observational humor... and the film has a charm...  All in all, a nice film to watch one time, though not sure I'd want to see it over and over - - My guess is that had Garlin stuck to writing and acting and the script and cast were virtually the same, but a Christopher Guest or Woody Allenesque director were pulled in, it really would have worked...

As for the story, its about an aspiring actor/compulsive overeater who at age 39 still live with his mother...
His life is falling apart, until he meets Beth (Silverman's character)... a cheerfully yet somewhat mentally ill/sexually uninhibited chubby chaser who work's at her sister's ice cream parlor.  The film unfolds at its own pace, but is held together by Garlin, Silverman and company...  (Most interestingly, Garlin pretty much plays a character similar to the one in CURB, and Silverman is definitely herself, so fans of both will enjoy, though sometimes its a bit awkward.)

In conclusion... quite a few laugh out loud scenes, but don't expect to be blown away...

Includes a cameo by Amy Sedaris as well as many other recognizable faces.",1218758400,,1523,4.720754716981132
3312327,4,B00125WASW,"Or like the French (and some ugly Americans like me) say, ""Qui couper le frommage?""

OK, now that I've gotten that off my chest, I'll admit I enjoyed ""I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With.""

""Cheese"" communicates in a very innocent, direct and quirky method, that is entirely endearing.  Its difficult not to develop some affection for Jeff Garlin.  This movie is essentially a ""stream of experience"" about Jeff's life as an nice, aimless, affable, funny, fat jewish guy.

Sarah Silverman delivers a performance that could (or will) be right out of ""The Sarah Silverman Program.""  Bonnie Hunt is wonderful as the school teacher, and Dan Castellaneta is great as the store owner.

I'm going to watch it again to make sure I don't miss any of the great humor, like when the homeless guy refuses to wear the pirate costume saying, ""I'm a homeless guy.  All I have left is my dignity.""

This would have been five stars, but as the movie begins to build toward what I thought might be the most important scenes, it suddenly ends.  Perhaps demonstrating my interest in the film, I felt ripped-off, like someone had just deleted a huge chunk somewhere in the second half of the DVD.  The last scene, which was supposed to be very meaningful, was probably set up by the missing material, so it just seemed to appear out of nowhere.

Its as if the producer of the movie, like Jeff Garlin's character, full of talented self-doubt, got off to a great start but suddenly loses his nerve just before closing the deal with the audience.

Still, you can't discount the good intentions and honesty of this little film.  Basically, Jeff is someone I'd like to meet, I think he'd be a lot of fun.

Oh well.  I'd be inclined to try a Jeff Garlin production again, hoping for some of the same quirky honesty.",1218499200,5,1785,4.60126582278481
3312328,1,B00125WASW,"When the movie ended I asked myself ""Who wrote this and how did they ever get the financing to make it?"". I found my answer in the director's commentary. The writer, director, star has alot of very good friends who acted in and contributed the funds to produce this film. Don't expect entertainment, romance or comedy. The story is largely autobiographical and depressing. Sarah Silverman's character seduces and then dumps the protagonist. She was just curious because she had 'never made it with a fat guy'. I enjoyed the commentary much more than the film. There are many familiar faces among the cast and the acting is good. There was nothing lacking in the technical aspects of the film. The story isn't even interesting.",1217808000,6,726,4.862903225806452
3312329,3,B00125WASW,"There were two things that keep coming to mind while watching this film;

 1- How cute Sarah Silverman is and
 2- How much Jeff Garlin looks like a young George Wendt (Cheers).

After pondering those two perceptions for about 80 minutes the movie came to an end and I was left to wonder what I had missed. According to my wife and daughter I didn't miss a thing. On well maybe next time I'm in the mood for cheese I'll try again.",1217721600,2,429,4.195121951219512

8244216,3,B00125WASW,"I first found this movie while on vacation, stuck indoors on a rainy day. I wasn't able to finish watching it, so, I bough it on DVD. I chose the movie because of funny man Jeff Garlin and Sarah Silverman as part of the cast. That really seems to be the only high light of this move. The constant hammering the viewer of the head with ""We're an homage to Marty"" so much so that James(Garlin) and I are going to have a falling out. The back story to some of the other characters is non existent, and the acting form the support cast is so bad that I want to turn the movie off and put it in my lettuce crisper for no other reason then I don't use the crisper for anything else.
The movie isn't completely devoid of merit. There is Sarah Silverman's introduction scene and James interaction with his best friend, and also his mother. This few things lend to delivery from the main cast that allows for some empathy to the story of a man down on  his luck and make you hope that it all works out for him.",1437868800,,1001,4.133333333333334

8244220,3,B00125WASW,"This independent, fairly low-budget and small-scale movie was clearly intended as a relationship comedy.  Sarah Silverman is at times screamingly funny, and Jeff Garlin who wrote, directed and starred in this piece, has a natural gift for comedy too, so I had hopes it would be both romantic and amusing.  I was a little disappointed on both counts; the movie is funny and serious in equal parts.  There were no belly-laughs here, although there are some amusing lines and dialog.  Lastly I was somewhat disconcerted by the ending, which came so abruptly it made me wonder if he had suddenly ran out of budget or time.  I assume there was a more artistic concept: that life is an ongoing story and any ""end"" is in some sense artificial.  C'mon: if you want to entertain, package it up with a nicely designed ribbon at the end, please?  Go ahead, sell out!  Pander to your audience!!
I suppose I should mention that although no rating is provided, you can rest assured that there is no real nudity (nothing more than you would see on a beach in the summer time) and the language is also kept tame.  To me, this would qualify for a PG-13 rating if it were given one.",1406937600,,1164,4.5311004784688995
8244221,3,B00125WASW,"I bought this because I watched part of it on television but was never able to watch the whole thing.  I like Jeff Garlin and Sara Silverman, however this movie plays somewhat like a long episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" with the same Italian music playing in the background.  There are some funny original scenes that are executed okay, but could be funnier. The story has an interesting premise but the scenes in the movie don't really pull it altogether.  Jeff's character just sort of exists in a fantasy world where starving actors somehow have money for food and rent.  There is a scene where Jeff is going to move out from his mother's apartment.  I just kept thinking, if this character is such a loser, how does he have the money to get into an apartment.  Sara Silverman plays an attractive 30 something ice cream parlor worker with who likes sex talk, but her character seems a little unbelievable. Other characters just appear out of nowhere as for no other reason that just to say a couple of lines and get a scene in the movie.  Oh well despite the deficiencies it was better than a lot of romantic comedies that are out there.  I gave it 3 stars because although it was an original idea was only mildly amusing.",1406764800,2,1227,4.520361990950226
