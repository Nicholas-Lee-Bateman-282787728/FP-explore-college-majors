8201752,5,B000ROA0BS,"Love Bolek and Lolek. I used to watch it as a child at my grandma's in Poland. I purchased it for my children and they love it. Cute adventure stories with sounds/music only (no talking), which can be watched by any nationality. My children are now 3 and 7 years old and still love to grab that DVD once in a while.",1439164800,,315,4.096774193548387
8201753,4,B000ROA0BS,"It's ""Tom and Jerry"" without voilence and more diversed. Good music in the background.
Characters and situations are simple but clever. My 6 yrs/2 yrs old grandsons love it.
Highly recommanded.",1321228800,,193,5.258064516129032
