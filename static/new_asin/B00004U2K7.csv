1354040,5,B00004U2K7,"What a wonderful way to time travel.  I thought that it was very interesting and informative.  When you see Victorian times portrayed in the movies, it is quite misleading.  It's portrayed as a quiet and gentler time, where women had a lot of time to learn to play the piano, visit friends or do needlepoint.  Maybe this was true of the wealthy, but for most women, the Victorian era was much more difficult.  There was much illness and disease and death especially amongst the children and many Victorian women were obsessed with death because it permeated their daily lives.  Housekeeping was time consuming and would start from sunrise to sunset. I truly enjoyed how the family really slipped into their roles as a Victorian family.  It was interesting to see the growing resentment in Joyce because she had to bear the brunt of living in the 1900 House.  I felt that many women of the era probably felt the same way, which is why women began to enter the workforce at that time.  Paul seemed to easily slip into his role as Master of the House as he orders the maid around the house.  This was a great history lesson to remind us that women and household appliances have come a long way since 1900.  This show made me appreciate many of the modern conveniences that I usually take for granted.  I will never look at the year 1900 the same again!",971740800,10,1349,4.528925619834711
1354041,4,B00004U2K7,"The turn of the century, life moving at a simpler pace without the fears and stresses of our modern world, elegantly dressed ladies, dapper gentlemen, horse drawn carriages and luxerious steamships. Who hasn't  wished they could find a way back to those times to escape the pressures of  our own? Well, an English family called the Bowlers did just that as part  of an experiment conducted by a television station to see just how far  domestic life has changed in the past 100 years. A period house was retored  to 1900 condition and the Bowlers lived there for three months as  Victorians. Their experience proves an eye opener for them and us as we  discover the ""Good Old Days"" were anything but.  Mrs. Bowler  discovers that doing laundry is an all day job, suffers a meltdown three  days into the experiment when the coal fired stove malfuntions for the  umpteenth time, she and 16 old daughter Kathryn get first hand experience  with female sanitation of the Victorian era, and Kathryn discovers that  being a teenaged girl in the year 1900 was quite a dull existance. Father  Paul revels in the Victorian role of father as Lord and Master of the  house. Elizabeth the girl Mrs Bowler hires breifly as a ""Maid of all  work"" gives us insight of what life for a domestic servant of the era  was really like. (Upstairs Downstairs this aint!) To really get an idea of  what it was really like to live back in the early years of the 20th  century, watch this video and hear it firsthand from people like you and me  who actually did it, the Bowlers.",963964800,15,1550,4.567272727272727

1354044,4,B00004U2K7,"The Bowlers, an everyday British family, were selected from 400 families who applied to star in what would become the most popular series on England's Channel 4 that season.  The Bowlers agreed to spend three months  living the life of a lower middle-class family of the late 19th century,  without modern conveniences, in an authentically reconstructed Victorian  house.  In the premiere, we see the producers' search for an appropriate  house, the hunt for authentic furnishing and housewares, and a construction  crew's removal of electricity, central heat, indoor toilet, etc., as they  turn a London row home of 1999 into The 1900 House.  We also see various  families' auditions.  In episode 2, the Bowler family is outfitted with  their 1900 clothing, and is greeted at their new home by the museum curator  in charge of the house's restoration.  We witness their first week in The  1900 House.  By part 3, Victorian life is starting to wear down the  family's composure -- especially the women's -- so the mother places an  advert for a housemaid.  The maid agrees to abide by the rules: cleaning  will be done using late-19th-century technology.  In need of a break, much  of the family visits a public baths -- except the women, who are not  welcome there.  Part four presents the end of the Bowlers' stay in the  house, and sums up.  Utterly fascinating and always entertaining.  It's  sort of what you'd get if you crossed THE REAL WORLD with UPSTAIRS  DOWNSTAIRS.  This American video release has an advantage over the video  that was sold in the UK, in that the PBS video contains the complete  four-hour series.",960768000,55,1626,4.885608856088561
1354045,5,B00004U2K7,It was wonderful. I am so grateful I have a VHS Player too. Wonderful play. The tapes were in amazing condition for the age they are. I,1383523200,,135,4.037037037037037
1354046,5,B00004U2K7,"If you are interested in history and sociology, how people really lived, you'll like this show. The producers made a smart choice in finding a warm, funny, tight-knit family that can work together and laugh together in all sorts of different circumstances. It's fun to imagine how you would have felt, trying to live the 1900 lifestyle.

Some of the things I got a kick out of is explanations of the complicated women's clothing (dresses, corsets, garters, etc.), trying to find entertaining things to do, trying to cook with the range, coping with hiring and having a maid, trying to get away with breaking the rules, and how long it took to do washing! It took days!

It's too bad they didn't try this with a few families, so that the family had other people to interact with. There's a lot of boredom felt by the oldest daughter and the mother, which is partly due to the time period and their restricted lifestyle, but probably also due to the fact that they had no one else to interact with. (Though the viewer doesn't feel bored watching this--it makes you ponder how you would have dealt with these problems.)

In the end, a really interesting piece following the lives of a caring and funny family trying to make the 1900 experience work.",1370131200,,1246,4.6289592760181
1354047,5,B00004U2K7,"The 1900 House works so well for two reasons. The first is that the producers really invested in making the house realistic and the terms of the ""experiment"" X. Everything was beautifully thought through, from the (surprisingly difficult) task of finding a working turn-of-the-century range to the less tangible work of figuring out how to handle money, purchasing, and leisure activities beyond the house itself.

The other is that the producers chose such a personable, genuine and modern family. They respond to the challenges of their ""time machine"" not just entertainingly but authentically; their responses often surprise them as much as they surprise us. Mrs. Bowler in particular is delightful--smart, quirky, thoughtful, and never prone to taking herself too seriously. Her moments of self-questioning don't just reveal the differences between life today and life in 1900; they help us understand what it is to be a mother, woman, and functional human being in any culture. Her experiences with the extremely labor-intensive house and the most obvious solution, a ""maid of all work,"" are just one example, speaking to the ways we must all negotiate issues of power and convenience. Virtually none of us will ever have that kind of maid today, but many of us will struggle to find a balance between work and self, self and family, what is fair to another and what is fair to ourselves.

In addition to those interested in late Victorian life and changing times more generally, I recommend the DVD for writers and other artists working on nineteenth-century subjects and themes. The chance to see what period homes ""lived"" and not just looked like is tremendously informative, a really useful supplement to the plethora of available books and images on the subject.",1346803200,2,1772,5.1280276816609
1354048,5,B00004U2K7,"There have been so many changes in the world in the last 112 years so a series attempting to have a modern family really experience what it was like living as a typical middle-class family in England in 1900 was extremely interesting.  Things we take for granted today did not exist in 1900 and it is no wonder that the family experienced culture shock in the three-month social experiment.

The 1900 House along with Frontier House are my favorites in the genre of having modern people live as people did in past generations.  Life was hard, confining and held dangers that no long exist due to improvements in sanitation, diet, safety regulations and improved knowledge.  Modern conveniences enable people, especially women, pursue other interests and activities outside cooking and cleaning.

I certainly don't believe that living in the 1900s takes one back to a simpler time; there is a reason our life expectancies are much better today and people are healthier and happier.

If you missed this British Channel 4 production when it was shown on PBS, I recommend you try to locate either a VHS or DVD of the series.  The producers and experts did a wonderful job attempting to make the experience as realistic as possible for the family.",1345680000,,1242,4.85781990521327
1354049,5,B00004U2K7,"I video recorded this series many years ago when PBS broadcast it and was looking forward to the release on DVD.  Its clearly the best of the ""house"" series public television did.  But $147.00 for a series nearly 19 yrs old is ridiculous!  I think $50.00 would be much more fair price.

1354052,5,B00004U2K7,"Although this standard of living was an improvement at the time, of course for we moderns it is a big step down. The family is very real as they attempt to live out the struggle. The details are so interesting, no matter how you choose to view it!!! For history buffs, not for critics. I loved the girls running out for shampoo, which one couldn't buy back in the day. Loved it.",1312761600,2,378,4.263888888888889
1354053,5,B00004U2K7,"The film starts by showing a house being selected, stripped of its modern amenities, and then refurnished with genuine furniture, appliances and accessories from the 1900s.  After interviewing 400 volunteers, the Bowlers are selected to live there (not a surprise since they're shown in the trailer).  The Bowlers enter this project with a romantic view of the Victorian era, but soon realize the details of daily life are quite unromantic.

Laundry is an all-day long ordeal that's even dangerous. The stove is also dangerous and won't heat up without constant supervision. Basically anything we do today with a press of a button, they have to do manually, which takes twice as long. Adding to the frustration, the wife has to wear a  a corset that makes breathing a chore.

I wasn't surprised the wife wasn't mentally stimulated by the monotony of chores or in serving her husband.  I was surprised, however, that she was allowed to make a play about modern day woman's values.  Such boldness wouldn't have been allowed then.  What's also interesting is that during the play, the mom and daughter shout about women's rights while the maid is slaving away for them.  The wife did eventually own up to the hypocrisy of this, though.

There's one scene that gave me chills. It's the scene where the family tour a museum featuring pictures of real Victorian women. At this point, I really got a sense of what life was like for a Victorian woman, so when the camera pans over their pictures, I felt like I saw into their souls.

The film ended a little too quickly for me. I would've liked to hear more about how the Bowlers adjusted to modern life after leaving the 1900s house. But overall, I found this film entertaining and informative.",1312675200,3,1737,4.775919732441472
1354054,3,B00004U2K7,"In order for something like this to work you really need to find a more isolated setting and enlist people who are thoroughly disillusioned with modern society and have minimized their ties with it.  They do exist, and I think the best place to start looking for them are with people who already ""re-enact"" certain periods; among them there will always be a few diehards.  So the way that this show was structured should from the beginning make one expect that it will come nowhere near to being an authentic depiction of life during this period.  Nevertheless, it would have been nice if certain members of the family would have given it a better attempt--namely the lady of the house and the eldest daughter.  In the end I think the most interesting part of the program was the first section where the house is renovated and all of the period furnishings were tracked down (sometimes at extraordinary lengths).  When on day three the mother had a serious, almost juvenile meltdown in front of her children who she should have been serving as an example to, it was clear this was going to be a difficult show to watch.  Sure enough there was much whining and bickering, obstinate refusals sometimes to play the roles expected in a turn of the century household.  Not surprisingly the focus began to narrow down on the (""oppressed"") position that women found themselves in.  This became most intense when the servant Elizabeth was ""hired"".  After awhile she began to actively try to better understand her role by conducting her own research; simultaneously Joyce became more concerned about her own hypocrisy in having hired another woman to be her servant.  So Elizabeth was unexpectedly let go--in other words, while Joyce thought she was ""liberating"" Elizabeth, back in 1900, she would essentially have deprived her of a job and sent looking for another (perhaps worse) position, or a life on the streets.  Moreover, she deprived Elizabeth of her own experience in 1900 House--since she seemed to really be the most keen and authentic disposition of the bunch, this really was a shame.  Much of the last section of the program saw dad and the youngest child (who I suspect was removed from the house for a length of time) completely disappear from the picture, and therewith any sense that 1900 House was an accurate portrayal of the period.  We have absolutely no discussion about what it was like for a middle class head of the household to earn a living during this period--evidently we're supposed to believe that because he could actually leave the house to work he led a carefree and privileged life...  And what about religion?  For many in this period it was still an over-riding influence in their home and social lives; I don't remember it ever being mentioned, and they certainly did not attend church once during the entire three months.  I give this program a three star rating because it does satiate to a certain degree an ""I wish that was me"" desire, but as for authenticity and entertainment it deserves only a two star rating.",1305244800,6,3047,4.797323135755258
1354055,3,B00004U2K7,"This was the first of the ""House"" series of period living experiments. It is very interesting and engaging on many levels. The idea of ""transporting"" a modern-day family back into the midst of a Victorian home, with all the ""conveniences"" of that time period, is a very compelling idea.

For a first effort, the show is not bad. (The other house installments are much better - especially the 1940's house, superb!) The producers obviously learned lessons from this one, and that increased the effectiveness of the others.

What is most problematic for the modern-day family is trying to get used to ""primitive"" circumstances while having been raised on contemporary appliances. Its really a no-win situation, while the participants reflect the difficulty of adapting/adjusting, (no shampoo or laundry detergent, uncomfortable undergarments, lack of hot water for baths, etc.) One would think the Victorian era was an unbearable existence for everyone.

But what's completely unexplored is how the Victorians were LUXURIATING in the conveniences the Bowlers sniff and sneer at, compared with what had come before! The emergence of the middle class, with significant disposable income, was a relatively new status; being able to afford a large house with indoor plumbing, carpets, kitchen appliances, and even a scullery maid! These people had it good, and they knew it.

You'll never get that impression from watching this documentary. To them, the Victorian era was dull, dark, dank, repressive, socially uninteresting, misogynistic, primitive, and worst of all BORING. But that is simply the impression of one very spoiled, contemporary family, not able to move much past their  initial fantasies. This show is much more a commentary on our contemporary values than anything, (which is rather ugly and wasteful in comparison.)

The whole ""House"" concept leaps from the minds of a few curious academicians, eager to recreate and foist their imaginations upon these initially wistful people. This is also a major theme of the House series - all the situations and conditions are engineered much like laboratory scientists create artificial environments for their mice experiments. You really get the feeling these people are being subjected to a low-grade form of torture - like, ""Things were TOUGH back then."" (Something like Python's Four Yorkshiremen [...])I really found that aspect very irritating. The later House shows scale this back much better.

All in all, this show is very watchable, though disturbing and ultimately unsatisfying. 1940's House is the one you want to watch to really see how well done this genre can be.",1286928000,4,2631,5.310096153846154
1354056,5,B00004U2K7,"You either hate this kind of film or love it.  I loved it.  After years of reading about Victorian history and wishing that I could experience what it was like to actually live in those times, I finally got a good idea of what it was like.  There is absolutely no way I could ever live like this and I admire the Bowler family for sticking it out. It was like a visual history book not about great men and battles but about the ordinary men, women and children of the time.

There are really two parts to the DVD: the restoration of the house and the family's story of living in it.  I was fascinated by both and the loving attention to detail.  An added dimension was Elizabeth the ""scivvy"" who made us realize that however hard life was for the Victorian upper classes, it was down right brutal for the lower.",1262649600,3,811,4.26797385620915

The show does a good job of indicating how the family lives their day-to-day lives and the kinds of technologies and gadgets they had in those days. But one draw back is that the show tends to degenerate into a 'call to action' for feminism which detracts from the entertainment value of the show.
If you like history, you'll enjoy this show, but if you are annoyed at being preached at about the role of women in society, the last episode might annoy you.",1235865600,2,615,4.451327433628318
1354060,5,B00004U2K7,"I see that some other reviewer had a difficult time with the complaining of the Bowler family, but to me that wasn't a problem (perhaps I'm so used to hearing people complain, it doesn't make much of an impression anymore).  I'm currently watching ""Manor House"", and conclude that ""complaining"" is part of the appeal of this series.  Deep down inside many people enjoy hearing complaints (perhaps a touch of schaudenfreude).  It keeps an emotional attachment going to watch people become worn down from overwork and lack of physical comfort waiting to see how long they can endure.

I enjoyed this show completely and would gladly see it again and again.",1232409600,,654,4.918181818181818
1354061,4,B00004U2K7,"The biggest issue I had is the same that other reviews have stated. I think the Bowlers were the wrong choice for this project. As a reenactor, I enjoy using past techniques as learning tools on how things have changed in daily living. I heard from someone who had auditioned for Colonial House that the producers of the shows prefer people who would be ""fish out of water"" instead of people more inclined to adapt to the new environment. The belief is that it would make for interesting television with the learning curve involved. Of course, I still got tired of the whining from the oldest women here, if you didn't want to wear a corset then a viable option at the time was the new uncorseted new natural line but it didn't catch on. There are ""working"" corsets also without at much boning but with proper support and ""modesty"" as needed.
I would have loved to see Mrs. Bowler try to make her own soap as my Grannie used to do with a big iron pot out in the back yard. I would love the chance to try this for a few months, especially with the safeguards of local health care/fire department within reach. No television or computer but I could manage with a telephone (they were around).",1215043200,3,1190,4.438356164383562
1354062,2,B00004U2K7,"I am not the kind of person to let a negative review really be a deciding factor when purchasing an item.  I had read the reviews of this DVD set, and though ""It can't be all THAT bad.""  So being full of optimism I went forth, and purchased! In hindsight, I should have listened to the reviews.

I have been collecting the entire ""House"" series, and must say that this is my least favorite OF THEM ALL.  All the family did was complain the whole time.  It was like spending 220 minutes listening to a child complain endlessly.  The family CLEARLY didn't think their decision to go into the 1900 house through.  It should be OBVIOUS to ANYONE that the work was going to be harder, corsets were going to be worn, sexism was going to be practiced, as would other customs of the time.

The reality of the concept was totally lost on this family. All they did was moan about how it wasn't the same as their normal lives. No kidding! That was kind of the whole point!  To honestly LIVE as if you were in that time!  It's what they signed up for...

The family's endless belly aching takes away from the hard work that had been put into the setting, so you no longer enjoy the visual aspect of it.  You learn hardly anything about the period because the family themselves hardly take an honest interest in doing it properly.  It's as if their goal was to go in there and test the bounds of how close they could get to cheating.  I was so disappointed in their lack of willingness to stick to it when they were sneaking to buy shampoo.

I got SICK TO DEATH of listening to that blasted Mother rant and rave about everything.  The food, the clothes, the work, and then the maid they got to do the work..NOTHING was good enough for her. She is too weak, & goes on a screaming rant only one week into the project.  It's quite uncomfortable to watch.

The only reason why I didn't get up and turn the disk off was because I had spent good money on it, and I was determined to finish it. Unless your goal is like mine, to have the complete House Series, avoid the purchase of this particular DVD set.  I suggest you spend a couple more bucks and get the Manor House DVD.

1354063,5,B00004U2K7,"This started to be a story about how a modern family would cope in the 1900 to show how much life has changed. It ended up being a real leasson on Women's Lib during that time.
In 1900 women were harshly restricted to the home not only cause of morality, but because there was so much work to do. Aplliances and new inventions like the washing mashine helped to liberate women all over the wold. They need to put THAT on a coin.",1193529600,,428,4.168674698795181
1354064,4,B00004U2K7,"The idea is to find a modern British family, restore a house to Victorian middle class condition, and make the family live there for 3 months. Will it be fun, like camping? Like being in a play? Or will it be a drag?

From the beginning, the producers make it clear that this is more of a thought experiment than research. It was impossible to find a really accurate, correctly working coal stove. They couldn't make everything in the house accurate to 1900, or modern health laws would have to be flouted.  They coudln't take the younger kids out of school, and the husband had to continue his job.

So the only ones with a complete 1900's experience are the wife and the teenaged daughter.  (Did anyone else notice that she was 16 and NOT in school? That, as I understand, is normal for Britain but weird for an American middle class family.) Wait a minute, the wife and daughter didn't have an authentic experience either, cuz in real life they would have had people next door to talk to, relatives to visit, etc. etc.  The situation was set up perfectly for the two of them to go bananas over the course of 90 days.

I read with puzzlement the reviews that complained about their complaining. Well, of course the wife and oldest daughter complain! They are the only ones whose lives have changed completely, all day and night! The twins, in particular, had very little change. They had each other to talk to, never had to wear corsets, and got to go to school each day. They didn't have to give up socializing as the eldest daughter did and got to see outside friends every day when they changed into 1900's outfits.  As to why they are complaining about corsets, haven't you ever had on an outfit that looked comfy but wasn't after 8 hours? What if you had to wear it for three months more after finding that out?

I very much enjoyed watching the degrees of struggle to 1900 s life. If you only have three outfits and wash them once a week, the romance is bound to fade fast. (Thank goodness no one in the house spilled anything or got the flu!)Chamber pots, chickens with black feathers so that they blend with the sooty air, lack of refrigeration and brushing your teeth with straight baking soda also don't fit the image of modern Victoriana.

This show cured my hang up with all things Victorian and more than that I cannot ask of any TV show.",1188172800,6,2353,4.466200466200466
1354065,1,B00004U2K7,"The location was scouted.  The stage was set.  The players were interviewed and chosen.  The show looked promising at first.

When will PBS ever learn?  You can not place modern people who are brainwashed with modern principles and expect them to follow the rules without bickering, whining, complaining and crying.

The females are too bossy and pushy to be ladies of the house.  The males are too wimpy and henpecked to be the masters of the house. PBS must interview these people better and ask them questions about the household structure and how they feel about it.  That's the only way that they will ever find a suitable family for these shows.

All that the mom did was whine and complain.  Nothing ever made her happy.  First she complained that there was too much housework.  So, she hired a maid.  She did not supervise her maid very well.  She said that she did not know how to reprimand her for being late on more than one occasion. Rather than doing the right thing and handling it properly and directly , she wrote her a letter firing her.  Then she went back to complaining that she had too much housework to do and that she was bored with it.

The husband/dad did not even have enough guts to stand up to his wife and daughter and tell them that they could not perform that silly feminist song at the theater.  Any real man would have stood up to them, so as to not ruin the reputation of the family.  In those days theater people were considered lowest of the low.  No self respecting man would put up with such nonsense from his wife and daughter.

The family whinged throughout the documentary especially the mother and eldest daughter, and there wasn't any focus at all the the young boy. The family also didn't always do things authentically which made watching it annoying and slightly disappointing.

Having said that, it is interesting to see how the average-income family would have lived in the 1900's with their furniture, their household budget and income, and entertainment.",1171929600,3,582,5.191489361702128
1354067,3,B00004U2K7,"I love the concept of being able to ""time travel"" - to live (as close to possible) as people did in a certain time period.  While I realize that too much of history has been rewritten and whitewashed, I am still fascinated by Victoriana.

Bottom line: The Bowler family was *the* wrong choice for this project.  I was very interested in the first half of the first videotape where we were shown how the project came together and how health and safety inspectors almost shut down the project for safety concerns.  But my interest faded once the family got inside of the house.

From Day One, it was non-stop whining on the part of Mrs. Bowler.  Even though she's a vegetarian, that lifestyle severely hampered the ability of the viewing audience to see Victorian cuisine in the present day (the local butcher laughed at how she was going to life such a lifestyle in accordance with Victoriana).

Another thing regarding Mrs. Bowler's being a vegan: WHY, after the project ended and the family was driven to a highway service station on their way home, did she go to a Burger King and order Whoppers?  A bit hypocritical, eh?

And perhaps I shouldn't say the entire family were a bunch of whiners.  The twins - Hilary and Ruth Bowler - were the only level-headed ones in the house.  I do believe the son, Joseph, was too young to have taken part in this project.

The fact that the family did not go out to theatres or engage in anything outside of the house until the very end of the project was another pitfall of the show.  There were plenty of ways people amused themselves back in 1900 - besides the local music hall (which, as it was pointed out, was not a place where Victorian parents took their children).  I'm sure such places were still around (or the equivalent of such) in 1999 England.

I was especially disappointed with the way the project influenced the Bowlers.  Instead of expressing gratefulness at being able to get to know each other better (unless that was edited out), all the family did was express gratefulness that there are numerous cleaning solutions on the market and that they had their choice of cosmetics and clothes.  How incredibly shallow!

The only good to have come out of this was, as Paul and Joyce themselves pointed out, that no one got hurt or sick for the duration of the project.

I give credit to the organizers of the project for a great and innovative idea.  It's too bad the wrong family was selected to execute the project.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1166659200,16,2491,4.565315315315315

The heating, plumbing, bedrooms, furnishings, lighting and all else are exactly to the standards of that long-ago year. The family must do everything as they would have had they truly lived in the final year of Victoria's reign, from cooking and cleaning, dressing, entertaining themselves and even working, all by 1900 standards. It sounds like a fun sociological experiment, but the problem is, not a lot happens in this long run-time. It's not a disappointment, but it's also not the sort of TV that makes you want to see it more than once.

It's not nearly as grand in scope as my favorite, ""Manor House"" series. While Manor House was isolated in the country, the 1900 house is situated in the middle of a modern neighborhood with cars visible out any window. People dressed in modern clothes stop by and the family shops at a present-day market. While the interior of the house is accurate to the last teacup, the outside world intrudes too much and breaks the illusion of living in the past.

1354071,3,B00004U2K7,"Okay, riddle me this? Why would you volunteer to be a part of a reality tv show where women wear corsets, didn't have the right to vote and treated their servants poorly, and then whine about it when you get on TV? Better yet, why would you want to watch it? After enjoying 1940's house I rented 1900 house only to find it not quite up to par. The problem with the series was not the setting...It was the Bowlers themselves. The Bowlers, particularly the wife and the eldest daughter were a bunch of whining wimps. Instead of throwing themselves into their roles, they continue to whine, complain and grouse about the things they 'do not have' and how 'unfair' everything is. Of course its unfair, this is the 1900's!

I was disappointed in Mrs. Bowler. Her vegetarianism and distaste for meat, cooking, and the hiring of a maid, meant we missed out on seeing some interesting Victorian era cuisine and we also missed seeing her develop some proficiency in creating meals from that era. There is only so much I could listen to her anti-meat ranting and see the insipid meatless dishes she cooked up. (To be fair, one time she made sausages, but only after whining about 'how disgusting' the meat provided by the butcher was). What's the point of watching a show about the Victorian era if all we get are dishes anyone can make in the modern era? (Spaghetti, vegetable soup etc.)

Ms. bowler's anti-corset rantings also took up at least twenty-minutes of screen time. Yes we know corsets are awful, unhealthy etc.  The teen daughter's whining and complaining also got on my nerves. Oh my god! I have to share a room with my two sisters! The sky is falling! Get over yourself and take advantage of the opportunity to learn something new- such as piano, writing, sewing, quilting etc.

The husband character was absent a lot, and the best character, I felt was the maid.

3 stars. Would be greatly improved by a cast who was actually INTO what they were doing. Also, the ending, and listening to how many of the participants disliked their experience annoyed me. Yes, I realize not everyone would like the experience, but I felt the participants could've been more positive.",1150329600,15,2171,4.672774869109948
1354072,5,B00004U2K7,"I'm not sure how they could have made 1900 House better.  When the participants break the rules they point out how things would have really been in 1900.  It's ludicrous to suggest that the producers could have created more context for the show.  To do so - to create lavish social conditions (more participants, social gatherings, etc.) - would have been well beyond the scope and budget of the project.

Viewer response to this show versus Colonial House is also revealing. 1900 House participants broke the rules all the time - they bought shampoo, they treated the maid better than a Victorian family would have, etc.  More importantly, the father and the children had lives outside the home in the modern era.  Essentially, these people had it easy compared to Colonial House who were mandated to have zero contact with anything remotely modern.

It seems that critics of Colonial House have a political agenda.  Any and all criticisms about participants breaking the rules and this somehow ruining the show is mindless.  Living as they did in the past, whether it be the US colonial era or 1900 Victorian London, would be misery for the vast majority of people living in the western world.  People aren't robots.  If you want a show where all the actors appear to follow the rules watch a fictional drama.  But then, all you'll be watching are professional actors playing a part.  You won't be seeing people live, suffer and even enjoy the lifestyles of the past - which is the whole point of making these programs in the first place.

Last word: 1900 House, like Colonial House, is a great television for adults and children alike.  It's our loss that more programs like this aren't produced.",1110326400,8,1699,4.790378006872852
1354073,3,B00004U2K7,"If I am counting correctly, we have been treated to four houses now.  ""Frontier House"" and ""Manor House,"" while entertaining in their own right, do not contain many elements to which the modern-day viewer could relate.  ""1900 House"" and ""1940's House"" by contrast, portray hapless modern-day families attempting to cope with situations & technologies that are quite familiar to us, even though the technology is much more primitive.
The Victorian era, for some strange reason, is an era that romantics on both sides of the Atlantic seem to long for.  We have all seen those dreadful ""Victorian Christmas"" and ""Victorian Wedding"" books.  It is an era that just oozes nostalgia.
""1900 House"" should kill any feelings of nostalgia once and for all.  Even though the technology looks familiar, it is clearly a struggle for this family to cope for any length of time.  The family was equipped with what was close to cutting-edge technology, but found every-day life to be tough sledding.  All this without showing the amazingly constricting moral constraints of the Victorian & Edwardian eras, which probably would have put the Bowler over the edge once and for all.
As other reviewers have correctly observed, there is a conspicuous lack of context in this show, as the very crucial aspects of social life & religious life are simply absent.  The Bowlers might as well have been living on a desert island, because there is precious little indication of life outside the house itself.
What we are left with is not so much a lesson in history as an anti-nostalgic smack upside the head, as we are reminded regularly that we, as modern-day people, could not cope with life in 1900, no matter how familiar that life may appear.
Just as nostalgia distorts history by emphasizing only the good stuff, this show similarly distorts history by presenting 1900's life as a non-stop struggle, but without putting it in its proper context.  This is not to say that the program was not extremely entertaining, but it was not as instructive as it might have been.",1074211200,12,2045,4.904347826086957
1354074,4,B00004U2K7,"I thought The 1900 House well done, overall; it revealed both the more elegant aspects of the era (home decor and clothing) and the more awkward aspects (everything painfully basic and time consuming).
However, I was startled to see that an intelligent, well-educated family of the 21st century could not function well with mere books, board games, and conversation for entertainment.
Perhaps this is because two absolutely central aspects of Victorian life were not included in their lives at all (and perhaps could not have been in this context): Church and social life, which often intersected, were vital to Victorians.
Unless you were a very disfunctional Victorian family indeed, this important community connection not only lightened some of the more dreary aspects of life, it was also seen as a moral obligation.  (This could be why the ""reality"" family found so little to converse about. Was life so boring because this was 1900 or because there was no social interaction at all for this family? That would be boring in any period.)
Another point (which the program addressed briefly but perhaps not quite accurately) was domestic service:  Many families in this economic catagory quite often seem to have had one live-in and one ""daily"" or to have sent their laundry out.  Various memoirs and autobiographies from this period also indicate that some servants, at least, took pride in their profession and were treated with respect by their sometimes struggling employers (Agatha Christie's excellent autobiography would be a good example).  Not all, but some.
This program did show us the down side of ""the good ol' days"" and kept us from romanticizing the period; but it is perhaps also true that we, as modern individualistic people, are losing the ability to appreciate a more community-oriented and simplified life (but who could not immediately empathize with the joyful return to a modern washing machine?!).
Thus, The 1900 House seems to have been quite as revealing about the pro's and con's of The 2000 House as it was about the very late Victorian era (when many modern conveniences were only ten or fifteen years away; had this been even The 1913 House, life perhaps would have been more bearable).",1060041600,20,2220,5.057377049180328

Unlike other reality shows, the presence of the family makes the atmosphere loving and supportive, not nasty and backstabbing. Everyone?s in it together, and that?s really nice to watch. But if you are, like myself, interested in history and specifically Victorian history, this movie is a rare gem. You get to see what we have glossed over in our interpretation of the period. I can say that I did over glamorize the lack of technology, and have never even pondered the constraints on diet and hygiene. The documentary truly opens your eyes to living history in a way no book or movie could. It is a little disappointing that all but one family member rejoined modern life for work and school, as I?m sure that somewhat lessened the full force of the experiment. But the experiment is still very forceful and, more importantly, fun to watch.

1354079,5,B00004U2K7,"For those of you who are interested in the reality-based programs out there, this documentary is more educational than the regular programs out there today.  With the romanticism of the Victorian Era, we expect that life during the turn of the century was more simple and more calm.  The family that decides to live life this way for a few months end up with some surprising discoveries.
The Bowlers are given an assignment to live life exactly like people did 100 years ago for approximately three months.  Mrs. Bowler openly admits during their experiment that in the beginning they were simply ""having fun dressing up"" but after awhile they realized that they had to do much more than wear costumes.
The Bowlers discover that life is a bit more difficult to handle while living in their alter-egos.  For instance, Mrs. Bowler has difficulty keeping her vegetarian lifestyle as she is subjected to the staple diet of 1900 (let alone a very bland diet back then that her fussy son refuses to eat.)  Also, cleaning alone can take ten times the effort as well as the laundry being a three-day job.  They have to get used to using bedpans and an outhouse as well as the daily stringing of the corset (to which two of them suffer shortness of breath) and if they get sick, they have to use only medications provided back then -- nothing modern.  Everything and anything they encounter has to be from 1900 and when it comes down to simple haircare, Mrs. Bowler gets literally fed up with the shampoo of that time and in a moment of weakness, grabs a bottle of modern conditioner at the store (which she gets in trouble for later.)
The whole family is able to record their personal opinions in what I refer to as the ""venting cabinet.""  It's basically a camera in a closet that they open up and talk to about their opinions, wishes and desires.  We see Mrs. Bowler use it quite a bit as she is genuinely frustrated with her older lifestyle.  Her husband, who has an easier time (being that he is the male bread-winner of the family and isn't expected to help clean) still helps out with housework and seems as if he's genuinely having a good time figuring out the stove and making the stove keep burning to keep the family warm for the night.  Still, little things are taken for granted, such as swimming during menstral periods are very taboo and lack of fresh eggs in the morning are soon remedied by obtaining a small coop of chickens in the backyard.
A very interesting portrayal of how it was back in the Victorian age and a must-see for those of you who are interested in that time period as well as anyone who loves those reality shows.  Quite an eye-opener",1008892800,3,2659,4.551362683438155

1354082,5,B00004U2K7,"Take a modern London house.  Remove all the modern appliances.  Rip out the electricity.  Take out the indoor bathroom.  Any products that weren't around in 1900 has to go.  Install gas lights, a range, old fashioned laundry facilities and furnishings from 1900.  Now, have a family move in live there for three months.  For those three months, they can only use appliances that were available in 1900, eat foods that were available in 1900 and engage in activities that were popular in 1900.  That's the premise of the 1900 House.
Just from watching this video set, you will be amazed at the conveniences that we take for granted.  You won't beleive the amount of work that went into maintaining a house in 1900, from the laundry (a never ending task -- you can't just throw it in the machine), to the cooking (on a range that didn't always work right and with a limited selection of foods), to the cleaning (it's difficult keeping the place clean without an electric vacuum cleaner -- especially with all the rugs).
On this tape you watch the Bowler family of London live in the 1900 house for three months.  Mr. Bowler (a marine), must learn to shave with a cutthroat razor.  Mrs. Bowler has to learn how to run the household.  The twin girls must learn to work around the house.  And the youngest boy has problems of his own when the family finds he doesn't like any of the foods available in 1900.
Little things that we take for granted are sorely missed in the 1900 House.
Sheets cannot be just thrown into the washing machine.  There is none.  They have to be boiled and pressed using an old fashioned hand presser.
Of course, there being no refrigerator in the house, the shopping must be done daily.  You can't keep perishables in the house very long.
Needless to say, cooking was a major headache.  No microwaves, not even a normal oven.  Controlling the temperature on the range they had was an incredible task.
While they did have a flush toilet out in the back, there was none in the house.  That meant keeping a chamber pot by the bed (Ugh!)
Boredom was even a factor.  Many of the things you and I like to do for entertainment weren't available.  You couldn't read a book printed after 1900, since they weren't available yet (that would really reduce Amazon's inventory!).  No television, no radio, very few periodicals.  The only form of contact with anyone outside was by the daily mail delivery.
This series was a real eye-opener to me.  It gave me a greater awareness of how far we have come technologically in the last hundred years, and gave me a better understanding of the life that my grandparents and great-grandparents lived.
I can only hope that if PBS does a series a hundred years from now called ""The 2000 House,""  we don't seem as technologically backward to the viewers then as the 1900 House seems to us.",978998400,7,2837,4.592445328031809
1354083,5,B00004U2K7,"This program entertains and instructs.  The principal lesson is that the wealth that ordinary people today enjoy in capitalist societies is gargantuan by historical standards.  This fact is true even when those standards are set by history as recent as a century ago.  A related lesson - one that points to the very reason that ""The 1900 House"" is an entertaining program - is that this gargantuan wealth is so widespread that we today take it for granted.
Wealth is to modern Americans and western Europeans what water is to fish: it's noticed only on those very rare occasions when it's absent - or when we see demonstrated vividly, as in ""The 1900 House,"" what life was like without much of the wealth that is widely available today.
The middle-class British family featured in this documentary had no idea just how difficult, tedious, dangerous, and dull life was for middle-class families only 100 years ago.  We see the family struggle with these hardships.  What we don't see - what we today cannot see - is how middle-class families truly of 100 years ago perceived their lives.  We look back on daily life of a century ago and marvel that our ancestors possessed the fortitude to deal with such hardships.  But I suspect that those same ancestors in 1900 looked at their daily world as one of marvels and conveniences unimaginable to their own parents and grandparents.
The audiences most appropriate for this documentary are those people today who self-righteously, but ignorantly, decry material wealth.  One open-minded viewing of ""The 1900 House"" will persuade anyone that, while not producing heaven on earth, the continuing expansion of material wealth makes everyone's life safer and longer, easier, and much richer in experiences.

The 1940 house is also a great experience just like this show.",1425254400,,694,4.17910447761194

High praise for those that designed the 1900 House as the attention to details was amazing. A very good movie to watch with your family -- especially when they say they're ""bored"" and that there's ""nothing to do"". I'll never complain about my modern appliances again! I wish this was in DVD format instead of VHS, but ... I'm not complaining!!!",1409875200,,497,4.659090909090909
