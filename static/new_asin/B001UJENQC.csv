3801875,5,B001UJENQC,"This is the greatest wildlife documentary ever, period. If you love Yellowstone, wolves, or wildlife you owe it to yourself to own this DVD.",1294617600,,140,4.875
3801876,5,B001UJENQC,I have been a collector of books and videos on wolves my whole life. Without a dout one of the greatest wolf films I own and have ever seen. Amazing story that anyone would love.,1290384000,8,178,4.114285714285714
3801877,5,B001UJENQC,I thought both programs were great. An amazing look inside our nations oldest National Park.,1289174400,,92,5.2
3801878,5,B001UJENQC,"I got this recently for my gf, and we both loved it! The special on wolves is very interesting and shows off any high def theater. This program is absolutely and completely different from the wolves in the Planet Earth series. The wolves featured in this series are primarily the druid pack in Yellowstone Park's Lamar Valley and the program focuses on their hunting in the winter, among other differences. The wolves are referred to by number, rather than by name (a little annoying to follow at times). Their stories are also well documented at [...]

I will admit that the Christmas in Yellowstone is fairly worthless. But one can't complain too much at 1080p video of one of the nations best parks in winter.",1257465600,10,712,4.696
3801879,5,B001UJENQC,"[My recent review for the standard definition version of this title-before I bought the Blu-ray]
I have always felt a spiritual companionship with wolves, and this DVD is one that I will cherish forever. Nature: Yellowstone takes an intricate look at the lives of a few packs of wolves in the Yellowstone region of North America. The way in which these various packs of wolves were depicted, and the time and energy it took to follow them from season to season, really gave me the impression that whoever worked on this piece really cared about what they were filming (creating), and they were willing to take the time to make sure that their footage contained emotional content, and that it was also carefully orchestrated. Christmas in Yellowstone (program two on this DVD) was also very good, and it proved to be a good accompanying piece to program one. Another great DVD about one wolf in particular is Nature: The Wolf That Changed America",1253750400,13,945,4.803680981595092
3801892,1,B001UJENQC,More wolves and less patronizing people would have gone a long way in this documentary. I would have been better served watching a wolves documentary on National Geographic than this weak effort!,1364947200,,195,5.125
3801893,5,B001UJENQC,"In The Valley Of The Wolves; is about a rivalry between two wolf packs, one pack is called the Druids Pack, and the other is called the Slough Pack. The location they focus on is in Yellowstone's Lamar Valley. The climax of the documentary is the battle between the Druids, and the Slough's. The Sough's are victorious and takes over the Druid's territory as their own.

Another interesting part is where the Sough Pack chased down, and kills a coyote that had intruded into their territory, and tried to feed on their kill. The music is good and the picture quality is crystal clear. The next movie is Yellowstone in Winter, this film is also educational, and more about the landscape than the inhabitants.",1363996800,2,707,4.701612903225806
3801894,5,B001UJENQC,"We watched a triple header with this one, the IMAX blu-ray on wolves and the IMAX blu-ray on Bears last night. The bears were a little too scary for Monkey. She liked the two wolf movies but didn't know they were wolves. She thought they were German Shepherds like the ones that walk by our house on a leash. We will have to invite our neighbor's cat Joey for a screening soon. Maybe he'll like the bears (their cubs are really cute).
As for me, I like all three.",1363305600,,463,4.213483146067416
3801895,5,B001UJENQC,"Fantastic wildlife films about our nations first national park. These films not only do they show the grand beauty of Yellowstone, but they leave you wanting more. For any nature lover's these movies are a must have.",1361232000,,216,4.864864864864865
3801896,3,B001UJENQC,"We watch ""Christmas in Yellowstone"" every year - it's become a tradition. It's a great family feel-good doc showing the beauty of Yellowstone around the holiday season. But ""In the Valley of the Wolves"", although beautifully shot and interesting, is definitely not for all family members. The 'harsh realities of nature' may be fine to witness for adults, but may be too intense and downright depressing for younger or more sensitive viewers. Several killings (and eating of carcasses) are portrayed, and wolf/coyote deaths are rampant. Bummer. 5 huge Stars for ""Christmas in Yellowstone"", maybe 3 for ""In the Valley of the Wolves"", with a bit of warning. Both features shot in High Def.",1354492800,3,687,5.088495575221239
3801897,5,B001UJENQC,"I have watched Christmas In Yellowstone on PBS many times.  It is so beautiful.  Can't wait to have the DVD so it won't have the logo at the bottom of the screen and, hopefully, it will be complete.  Sometimes when they show it, they cut parts of it out.",1347062400,,254,4.142857142857143
3801898,5,B001UJENQC,"What can I say?  This was entertaining and about wolves!  Raw, too - they don't hide the brutal realities of nature.",1344384000,,116,4.476190476190476
3801899,5,B001UJENQC,"You will remember ""In the Valley of the Wolves"" for years.

This is a very different kind of wolf film.  As an astute document of the tribal life of wolves, it delivers a visual message that is devoid of obtrusive, controversial theory about the impact of restoring wolves to their role as top predators.

Further, it is neither about wolf life-cycles, nor their behavioral and physiological adaptations.  Rather, it paints a long, sober portrait of the ever-present quandaries of wolf tribes.  Filming spanned three years -- more or less equivalent to the natural life span of a wild wolf -- and it becomes glaringly obvious why their lives are so brief in the wild.  Even with human protection and monitoring, they face their own overwhelming and often totally unexpected struggles in survival -- daily struggles that are compounded seasonally by stark rates of generational turnover.

Along the way, this film takes a look at the parallel lives of species that literally follow wolf packs in the very traces.  Landis makes especially poignant juxtaposition to coyote lives, canids who are subjugated by wolves primarily to scavenging and foraging along the fringes of wolf territorial claims.

Bob Landis is the eye behind the lens, and he is featured in conversation in a 15-minute DVD extra.  Christmas in Yellowstone is a wonderful, worthwhile complement to the main film.",1309996800,,1378,5.084444444444444
3801900,5,B001UJENQC,Great video.  Everyone needs to see this and understand the wolves!  They need protecting and this is one way to understand why we fight to save them.  This DVD was purchased as a gift.,1302048000,,185,4.382352941176471
3801901,5,B001UJENQC,I got this movie as iam currently training my dog and Iam learning about dog behaviour. Thus wolves behaviour is a great way to understand your dog. This movie was so good every minute is filld with great images and has a great story to it. I wasn't bored for a second. If you want to see wolves live in there natural environment this movie will not disappoint you.get it no question about it. The blue ray is of very good quality considering that most shots are using top of the art zoom lenses.,1299369600,,496,4.287234042553192
8343985,3,B001UJENQC,I cannot give a good review to a $20 BD disk that DOES NOT HAVE SUBTITLES!  The photography is beautiful but the narration is not OK without subtitles.,1452556800,,151,4.392857142857143
8343986,5,B001UJENQC,Great story - real but not gory images - solid reminder for all of us that we share this world.,1427673600,,95,3.8
8343987,5,B001UJENQC,"""In the Valley of the Wolves"" is definitely a top-quality nature video.  Beautifully filmed and composited, with an intelligent, coherent narrative, it is a film to be enjoyed over and again.  The kids were especially enthralled to view it before our Yellowstone trip.  The main focus is on wolves, but there are also great shots of coyotes and foxes.",1425600000,,351,4.915254237288136
8343988,5,B001UJENQC,"In the valley of the Wolves - Great filming of the wolves, liked it a lot! Simple story, but touching, worth watching.
Christmas in Yellowstone - ehh, take it or leave it.",1421193600,,171,4.375

8343992,5,B001UJENQC,An enjoyable DVD,1405641600,,16,4.666666666666667
8343993,5,B001UJENQC,Our family enjoyed following the wolves in Yellowstone. The scenery was fantastic. We are looking forward to more. Go Druids!!,1401753600,,126,5.35
8343994,4,B001UJENQC,"I thought both of these nature documentaries were fantastic - especially Christmas in Yellowstone - but if you're looking for blu ray picture quality as astounding as the Planet Earth series, it's not nearly as good. Not bad by any means, but certainly missing some of the vertigo-inducing crisp sharpness that 1080p fanatics like myself obsess over. For the great price, I still give it a high recommendation. Great for wintry nights, or in my case, a cheap way to beat the July heat when the air conditioner is on the fritz.",1373155200,2,526,4.728260869565218
