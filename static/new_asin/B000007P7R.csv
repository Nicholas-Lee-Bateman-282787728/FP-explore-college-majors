The movie itself not bad and done in D'Amato style.",1441065600,,149,4.481481481481482
7905116,2,B000007P7R,"Well... I remember this movie being broadcast on cable years ago. This was the uncut version of the film. It was broadcast at least 3 times a day. I bought this DVD because it claimed to be the uncut version of the film. It is NOT.  I know there is at least 8 minutes of the film that is missing. I don't understand why it is so hard to find the original version of this movie. The adult parts are pretty tame by todays standards. After my tedious efforts to research and find this movie, I am very disappointed.",1420848000,,512,4.171717171717172
