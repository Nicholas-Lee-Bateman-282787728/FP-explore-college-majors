8117194,2,B000F48DBY,No color and details about planes and/or pilots is very sketchy.  Not worth the cost.,1521331200,,85,4.666666666666667
8117195,4,B000F48DBY,lots of footage I hadn't seen before,1485648000,,36,4.285714285714286
8117196,5,B000F48DBY,This is a good addition to your war library.  I learned a few new things and saw some new footage.  I would recommend this.  Especially for the price.,1370390400,,150,4.285714285714286
8117197,4,B000F48DBY,"Most of the program centers on the Messerschmitt Bf-110, which first flew in 1936.

Ironically, the heavy fighter was doomed from the start:  ""The whole notion of such an aircraft (the long-range heavy fighter) is flawed inasmuch as it is a compromise in all things. To attain the range, the plane has to be fairly large. If so, then it becomes unmaneuverable, and unable to dogfight with the lighter and more nimble fighters it is seeking to destroy. A heavy airframe needs powerful engines which raises the weight. The concept of the Zerstrer (heavy fighter) was to military aviation what the battle cruiser was to warships.""

This program, Luftwaffe Nr. 3 in the series, has a good mix of technical details, history, and some human interest, like images of Wolfgang Falck, or Major Lenz, or Hauptmann Walter Ruebensdorfer. The Kammhueber Line, and the development of radar, with the back and forth, between the British RAF and the German Luftwaffe, is shown with drama.

In spite of the inherent shortcomings of the night fighter design, the destruction of 5881 British heavy bombers by the German night fighters attests to their  effectiveness-- or at least to the inadequacy of the British Lancasters and other bombers.",1369526400,3,1224,5.009852216748769
8117198,3,B000F48DBY,"As a previous reviewers has noted, this video is much more on German Heavy Fighters than night flyers. About two-thirds of the film is on these and only one-third on night flyers. The video covers the ME 110, ME 210, ME 410, Arrow, JU 88, and Dornier Bomber night flyer versions. The footage is roughly broken out by the percentage of aircraft manufactured in Germany, like most of the other videos in this series (ie, about half is dedicated to the ME 110 and the rest to the other aircraft).

If the viewer has more than introductory knowledge on these aircraft (i.e., has read even an brief introductory book on the aircraft), the video has little in the way of information to offer. For those who know next to nothing, however, the video would be quite informative and would be a good introduction to the aircraft. In other words four stars for those who need an intro and only 2 for those with decent knowledge of the covered aircraft.

With respect to film footage, it is quite good, especially regarding the ME 110. There is footage from nearly all fronts this aircraft served during nearly all periods of the war (even in Finland where there was quite a surprising amount of dust in the summer) and in a variety of uses (i.e., fighter, ground attack, recon, etc.). With respect to the ME 410 the footage was also quite good, especially the close-ups showing the bays where ""pod"" weapons could be attached. You rarely see this even in short books dedicated just to the aircraft. Again, coverage of the non ME 110 aircraft is from a variety of fronts, periods of the war and differing roles (ie., recon, fighter, fighter-bomber, etc.).

All and all not a bad expenditure of an hour of time.",1259798400,4,1696,4.6092715231788075
8117199,5,B000F48DBY,"This video is actually ""Zerstorers"" (Destroyers) so it encompasses more than just night fighters of WWII Germany.

This is an excellent DVD on the ME110 and other aircraft Germany created during WWII that fit the ""Destroyer"" classification. The video does a fairly good job of explaining the origins of the type. The Zerstorers were designed to serve as escort fighters for the Luftwaffe's bombers. Since this required long-range, the fighters were almost as large as the bombers and having two engines to accomodate the required fuel.

It turned out to be a misguided solution to the problem because the Zerstorers were too big and not maneuverable enough to 'mix it' with smaller, defending fighters.

But, they were not without worth. They could serve as fighters in Russia where their disadvatages were less pronounced, as ground-attack weapons and also as night fighters that had enough room and carrying capacity to mount airborne radar and other passive systems that came into use throughout the war.

The video concentrates on the ME110 but does not ignore the ME210/410, the JU88 (in night fighting role), and others that player much smaller parts in the German war effort.

The video does a very creditable job of covering the specifics of night-fighting against RAF Bomber Command as well as daylight attacks on USAAF bomber formations where the Zerstorer played a smaller part in Germany's defense.

The combat footage is excellent! Usually, combat footage of German aircraft is restricted to their aircraft being blasted out of the sky by allied fighters. This video has very good and enlightening footage from 'the other side of the hill'. We see an ME110 stalking and shooting down an Ilyushin Sturmovik (you can also tell how much punishment the Sturmovik could take!) as well as British ground targets being strafed in North Africa.

This is an excellent video in an excellent series and I do recommend it!",1243900800,5,1923,5.0664556962025316
