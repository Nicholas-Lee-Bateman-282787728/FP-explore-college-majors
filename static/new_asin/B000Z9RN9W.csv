8235126,5,B000Z9RN9W,"I believe the people not rating this DVD Good haven't been widely awake in thier lives or while watching this DVD, because
1) The material he's talking about, well if you've had ups and downs in life, you know he makes a lot of sense and he backs it up with hardcore scientific evidence.
2) Its only towards the end he talks about people signing up for his harmonic wealth event because this was just less than 2 hours of information. THAT is more than a weekend.
So 5 stars for this DVD, do yourself a favour, drink one less coke and eat 1 large pizza less, and get this DVD (OK probably 2-3 cokes and a pizza, but you get the 'drift').
Or probably the people not giving this a GOod rating are just stuck in their comfort zones... Whatever...",1279843200,,743,4.276595744680851
8235127,1,B000Z9RN9W,I do not see that he presents any statistically valid evidence that his techniques produce significantly more wealth for people who have purchased this CD.,1245110400,2,155,5.24
8235128,2,B000Z9RN9W,I believe that Mr. Ray is teaching some great stuff thru his books and CDs but this video is what you would experience if you went to his free seminar workshop.  I agree with other reviewers.  Mr. Ray needs to call this DVD what it is ... a promotional tool.... or offer it for free (minus S&H).  I felt as if someone went into my pocket and took [...] bucks from me.  Bottom-line:  Like James. Don't Like the DVD!!!,1209081600,8,416,4.215189873417722
8235129,3,B000Z9RN9W,"I agree with the other reviews so far - he is FULL of enthusiasm and really gets you going...but the whole time watching this I felt like ""what's the catch?"" And so at the end - you do indeed realize that it is a long form pitch for his weekend long seminar. That said, there IS still a great deal of info to be gained from this video - so it is NOT a total waste at all!!  When it was over I wanted to watch it again. Just realize that you're not going to get 'all' that you think he'll be presenting to you as you go along.",1207094400,5,525,3.81651376146789
8235130,3,B000Z9RN9W,"His enthusiasm and energy are quite contageous.

I loved his message and you can feel the passion spilling out of the video and into your living room.  Fascinating implications are present
throughout the entire video.

I wish that he had a more detailed explanation on ""how to"" use the information on the 4 scientific break-throughs he discussed.  I was
under the impression that the DVD had a practical aspect in addition
to the informational one presented.

You may also ""rent"" the video as I did by logging onto his website,
[...] for $9.97 and downloading the material.  Should you
desire to purchase the video and have it shipped, the $9.97 will be applied towards the final cost.

He really does offer fantastic information.  He has many years of esoteric studies behind him and presents the material in a
spell-binding manner.  I will purchase more of his other products
and get to one of his live events one of these days.

The two draw-backs were:
1.  Not enough info on practical applications.
2.  Too promo at the end.  He's selling his Harmonic weekend.
  I appreciate having this information, but feel that he could
  have sent out an email (or several) with a brief (free) video
  offering details on this event.  Perhaps he would consider
  the possibility of applying the charge for the video towards
  the cost of the seminar for those who are considering attending
  this weekend?",1206316800,5,1398,4.817796610169491
8235131,3,B000Z9RN9W,"The DVD is informative and entertaining.  At the end he has less than 5 minutes of promotional information and testimonials.

I will watch the DVD about 5 to 6 times to comprehend the almost 90 minutes.

I enjoyed and recommend the DVD.

Thanks for the opportunity to share my opinion.",1206144000,3,285,4.64
8235132,1,B000Z9RN9W,"This was like a great movie with an awful ending!  He's a good speaker with a lot of good things to say, but come to find out what a used car salesman he is -- this was a come-on to invite you to his $1297.00 Harmonic Wealth Weekend to find out 'how to...""!  I was so disappointed at the end.  Isn't this called bait and switch?  James, ugh, I'm appalled.",1200355200,30,355,4.0285714285714285
8235133,1,B000Z9RN9W,"After attending James Ray's Harmonic Wealth Weekend, I was excited to see he had a new DVD out.  Unfortunately, while watching this DVD I realized this was nothing but a promotional tool to get people to sign up for the Harmonic Wealth Weekend.

  I highly recommend the Harmonic Wealth Weekend Seminar, however, this DVD is nothing but a recording of his sales pitch to get people to sign up for the Seminar.  The quality of the DVD is also very bad, I had to fast forward through about 30 minutes of the video because the quality of the recording was so bad.

  James, please don't try to sell this DVD as anything but a promotional tool.  You should also personally watch this DVD.  I am amazed you would associate your name with such a poor quality DVD.",1198800000,47,757,4.45985401459854
