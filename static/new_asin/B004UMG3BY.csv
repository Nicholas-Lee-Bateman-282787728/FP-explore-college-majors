8441836,1,B004UMG3BY,This video consists of someone driving around in a car and stopping randomly for wine tasting. There is nothing cycling related about it. It is supposed to be in bluray but presents as less than dvd resolution with a drunk person holding the camera. I don't recommend it.,1331337600,,271,4.666666666666667
