1331762,5,B00003M5FJ,"My son was a baby when I bought the whole series of Hap Palmer's songs, he loved them!  Even though he is 18 now, I still remember the words to the songs, and find myself singing them now!",1261872000,,188,3.9473684210526314
1331763,5,B00003M5FJ,"I have two boys with autism, now ages 14 and 21. Both are obsessed with Baby Songs Rock & Roll and have been for years. We've gone through multiple copies in VHS.

Today I am purchasing the first of what will no doubt be many DVD versions. Come Monday, my oldest will move to a group home, and he will be taking ""Baby Rock"" with him.",1237420800,,333,4.045454545454546
1331764,2,B00003M5FJ,"Amazon includes the DVD BABY SONGS ROCK AND ROLL under my name Hap Palmer. I just want  to make it clear that I have nothing to do with this DVD. You can look at the box to confirm this.

My songs are used in many other Baby Songs DVDs but I have nothing to do with the DVD BABY SONGS ROCK AND ROLL. It does not use my songs, I do not sing on it and I had no involvement in the production.

1331765,1,B00003M5FJ,"I agree 100% with ""busapp.""  The production value is very low and the videos are 'scripted' in a ridiculously cheesy fashion.  The cover suggests that little kids are playing instruments (or at least playing along with toy instruments); that's not the case at all.  It also says it was produced in 2004.  But it's quite obvious that the music videos were shot in the 1980's (maybe they burned the DVD in 2004).  My daughter loves watching other kids dance and sing and play along to music videos (like Jack's Big Music show on Noggin).  But this video couldn't keep her interest for more than a few seconds.  Had the cover art been a little more honest, I wouldn't have purchased this DVD.",1186876800,2,689,4.598360655737705
1331766,1,B00003M5FJ,"The video has very little to do with the songs.  The video is a type of poorly produced and poorly directed series of sketches of people doing things.  However, what they are doing has very little to do with the music.  There is a connection, since the video has items similar to what the songs are considering, but the connection is not in rhythm and misses the point of rock and roll altogether.  The video does not rock to the music.  So, watching the video does not inspire the little one to dance.  This is a cheaply made and cheaply put together video that is way below standard.  It is not worth the price.",1181692800,,613,4.324561403508772
1331767,5,B00003M5FJ,"Ok, to begin with I had no idea who Hap was.  I just knew that I didn't want my triplets hooked on broadcast TV stuff that was full of marketing, commercials, etc. So we ordered BabyFirstTV (kinda like HBO for babies) and during the programming they would show these videos.  It didn't take long for me to notice that my kids were MESMERIZED by Palmer's music videos.  I quickly recognized the prints and hairstyles from my own childhood (80's kid) and went on a search until I found the DVD's here.  The kids LOVED them and now that they are almost two they actually ask for them by name.  I would HIGHLY recommend these DVD's to anyone who is interested in exposing their children to music, rhyming, social skills, development skills, sillyness and laughter via your DVD player.  I am not saying they take the place of actual experiences but they sure do enhance them.  You don't know how handy it is to get your triplet toddlers to quickly cooperate and follow instructions by just singing a simple song to them. Anyway, long story short....  WE LOVE HAP PALMER AND THESE DVDs!",1180742400,,1080,4.588541666666667
1331768,5,B00003M5FJ,"My cousin gave me a Baby Songs VHS tape that she had from 14 years ago that was pretty worn out, but my kids loved it so I bought 5 of the Baby Songs series DVDs for my twins (now 17 months old).  They cannot get enough of these DVDs, from the time they wake till the time the finally crash, they are asking to watch 'moooo' which is 'movie' in their language!  This Rock & Roll one is their 'least' favorite of the five I purchased right now, but I think it will hit the spot when their closer to 24 months old. I highly recommend the Baby Songs Original, Baby Songs Babies Busy Day, Baby Songs Animals, and Baby Songs ABC,123 also! A++++",1168819200,,639,4.104
1331769,5,B00003M5FJ,I may not be a child psychologist but I also have a 2 year old as well as 15 nieces and nephews. My daughter has loved this video from 11 months old and is now 2 and it is still one of her favorites. She has learned the words to the songs and mimics the dance steps. She has a great time dancing with her dad to the songs. I love watching her have so much fun. Whenever her cousins come to visit they have a ball dancing to this video. I highly recommend it from ages 10 months to 6 years.,998265600,8,489,3.803921568627451
1331770,5,B00003M5FJ,"This is one of the first videos that we bought for our daughter when she was about a year old.  I picked it up at a garage sale for a buck (sorry Amazon).  For a while this was her favorite - although now she's into The Wiggles.  The tape contains many classic rock and roll songs done by the original artists.  For adults this is a plus and a minus.  At first, I enjoyed hearing these classic tunes again.  After hearing them about 1000 times they are starting to irritate me - I never thought I get to the point where hearing ""Blue Suede Shoes"" would get on my nerves.
The video portion of the tape holds our daughter's attention. For each song there is a skit or series of shots that have something to do with the words of the song.  Examples: With Woolly Bully they show a kids playing with someone in a bull costume.  Blue Suede Shoes has a skit taking place in a shoe store.
The version of the tape that I bought came in one of those cheap cardboard slip cases.  Kids tapes get dropped or banged around a lot (at least ours do) and this doesn't really protect them.  It appears as though the version on Amazon comes in a plastic case.  I think that this is a better way to package them.
If your kids like music and live-action videos (as opposed to cartoons) then I think that they will enjoy this tape.",970185600,3,1309,4.196

7919095,2,B00003M5FJ,"Although this movie arrived on time and was nicely packaged as well as works great, I have nothing but good things to say about the seller it is the video itself that stinks.

As a parent with many many Baby Songs videos as my daughter loves loves loves them.  This is by far the worst.  It is old and has very old music.  It is nothing like the other Baby Song videos.  THe quality stinks and it does not have the original singing and/or little videos.

Do not spend your money on this video. you could make a better one in your backyard.",1333670400,2,539,4.184466019417476
7919096,5,B00003M5FJ,"My mom bought this for me when I was a baby. This video always kept me occupied and I'd watch it over and over. I searched high and low for this video all over the internet and finally found it! (Currently waiting for it to be shipped). Yes I'll admit, as a adult I Still watch it to this day. It is really cheesy and old but it has always been one of my favorites! Great for any child, I definitely recommend!",1323475200,,410,4.012195121951219
