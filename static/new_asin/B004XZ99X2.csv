8447769,3,B004XZ99X2,"Like many of the other Grindhouse collections in this line, there has been no real attempt to restore these films.  All three show years of film damage and fading to various degrees, with the third film being in the worse condition.  Depending on your aesthetic preferences on the subject, this could be desired or despised.  Other than the film damage, the transfers are acceptable; they are not too dark, clipped or overly compressed.

When I got my disc, I found that it was off balance, and would vibrate loudly in the player during loading, menus and the third film, ""Kathy's Graduation"" (the movies are listed in reverse order on the cover).  By loud, I mean it's annoying even from across the room, and in all likelihood, damaging to the player.  At about halfway through the third film, the noise subsided, but was still audible.  It wasn't present during the first two films, suggesting that these were recorded further out toward the edge of the disc, and the player was spinning the disc slower for these. (DVDs, like CDs, use a Constant Linear Velocity (CLV) playback method, where the speed of the disc surface in relation tot he laser is the same, from center to edge, which means the disc spins faster when content near the center is being played and slower at the edge.)

I returned the disc for a replacement.  The replacement has a similar problem, though it's not nearly as loud, and is really only noticeable across the room during loading for a few seconds.

I've posted a private video of this noise on YouTube at http://youtu.be/1pDHfY_lygs

The disc itself played fine in both cases.",1405468800,6,1607,4.765342960288809
