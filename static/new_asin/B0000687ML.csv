My daughter, 16 months at the time, clapped and danced to the zoo song and when the puppets came on screen. The puppets are not sock puppets but look more like muppets (with different colored faces like purple and yellow) and one puppet is a monkey.

The animals shown in Jungle tot are zebra, giraffe, bears, elephant, lions, monkeys, camel, parrots, wallaroo and a sea lion. Between each animal segment are the puppets on a zoo train. The music each time the puppets are on the train is ""Oh Suzannah"". The puppets are looking all around while the music plays and the train moves. This part, with the puppets riding the train, is a bit long. Each time it's about 20 seconds, but they do it 9 or 10 times....so that does get a bit old fast. For each animal they follow this same format:

1. Live action shots of the animal at the zoo and they give an interesting fact or two

2. A question is asked (for the monkey segment the question is: what animal loves bananas?)

3. A baby in the animal costume

4. A song with the puppets

5. A puppet plays a musical instrument with a window behind him. After his song the bamboo-looking window shade rolls up and you see the baby in the costume again

6. Lastly, some decorated animal cookies on a stick (shaped like the animal for that segment) bounce up and down. They could have done without this part; kind of lame, if you ask me.

Then they go back to the train with the puppets who are going to see the next animal. Then this same sequence is repeated for the next animal.

I like that it is closed captioned so you can put the words on the screen so you can sing the songs. When they showed the male and female lions they called them the King and Queen of the jungle. I don't know where I have been but I never heard a female lion called the Queen of the jungle. Have you? Other then a few little things like this the video is good. The other videos in this series, Your Tiny Maestro and Your Tiny Artist, aren't nearly as good. Please read my other reviews.",1116374400,,2117,4.2725
