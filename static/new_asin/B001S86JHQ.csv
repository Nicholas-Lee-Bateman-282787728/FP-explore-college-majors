8339521,5,B001S86JHQ,"My wife and I have purchased Rick's books on Dublin & Edinburgh and found them to be excellent primers on the cities. We have also purchased his videos and have found them to be very good on the cities tourist attractions. We have booked a 9 day escorted tour of Rome, Tuscany and Venice and purchased his book to read ahead of what to expect. The chapters are well divided into the major cities with great information on the major tourist attractions, hotels and restaurants. I particularly liked the 2 or 3 self guided walks which were very informative. There is very practical information in the back regarding, history, using the Italian phone system, weather and transportation. There are even 2 pages with commonly used phrases and communicating in an Italian restaurant. Rick lists books and videos on Italy also. I have purchased his Italian phase book because it is very nice to be able to say a few phrases to communicate. We will take this book along with us on the trip and hope to be better informed on our trip.",1363392000,,1025,4.637362637362638

Rick Steves is the best guide, he is humorous, gives us just enough information about the area he is visiting and has a genuine flair about him that makes you very comfortable.  I would highly recommend any of Rick Steves travel videos.",1304553600,3,394,4.184210526315789

8339526,5,B001S86JHQ,"Okay if you've read my other review on Rick Steve's Greece & Turkey DVD your probably thinking I work for Rick but I don't. In case you haven't read my other review here goes... it's also rated 5 stars, very similar to this one.

This DVD covers every major Italian city you'll visit or wish you could visit if your pressed for time. Milan, Lake Como, Naples and Pompeii are in wide screen. Florence, Rome and Venice are in standard mode. DVD provides a insider's perspective with lots of practical tips. Excellent commentary and cinematography. I highly recommend that you purchase one of Rick's guidebooks either softback or ebook version. All of his guidebooks answer everything you could possibly want & need to know in order to plan your trip effectively.  Lastly, I recommend that you download all of his Italian destination podcast as well.",1280707200,23,847,4.834482758620689
