1409953,4,B000059ZXS,"This movie is informative with fiction added. The suspense of the movie is portrayed by the facts presented. It's the closest thing to what is likely the truth about J.Edgar Hoover's life you'll find---especially given the onslaught of one-sided written and movie attacks on one (Hoover) who gave a great deal more than most to the country he loved. While many did their best to destroy Hoover's reputation in the aftermath of his death,here,Broderick Crawford portrays Hoover as a great American but human--with his own skeletons in the closet (no pun intended) and who made his share of mistakes. The movie also touches on the lives of other great Americans--John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. One sees that they,just as Hoover,were human,made mistakes and had their skeletons just as we all do. (See the movie's version of the Kennedys and Marilyn Monroe). Although much of what we would like to know went to their graves with Hoover,King,the Kennedys and others,this movie is,in many respects,the closest to the truth about Hoover and,to a lesser extent,the Kennedys and King that's been attempted. It will probably anger all who see it,whatever their political slant,to some extent at least,and that fact alone points to the best reason to get this movie and watch it with an open mind.",1013644800,19,1304,5.041666666666667
1409954,4,B000059ZXS,"Casting Broderick Crawford as Hoover was a stroke of genius on the part of the casting director of this film. He's perfect for the part. He brings out the gruffness and arrogance of the character, while simultaneously showing the insecure, low self-esteem inner man that Hoover is portrayed as being.
We see him first as a young idealist, working in the Justice Department, wanting to protect the legal rights of immigrants and fighting the internal corruption of the FBI in the 1920's. Then he becomes the ""Top Cop"" of the nation and a publicity seeker with the help of Walter Winchell. And finally as an old man jeolously guarding his power and firmly entrenched in the political system. But more importantly, we see the dual nature of his morality: on the one hand, his fastidious approach to sexuality and his ego crushing sensitivity to his own unattractiveness; and on the other hand, his sessions-------bottle in hand--------listening to the sexual encounters on FBI surveillance tapes.
The film is not without humor, however. Look for a scene about disposing of a fly in Hoover's office.
In some ways, a waxworks of a film with actors looking and sounding like famous political leaders, but more importantly a record------part fact, part fiction------of a very complex man, who's personality and inner demons helped to form the concept of justice in the American public's mind from the 1930's until his death.",983664000,16,1417,5.034042553191489

It did, however, play on my computer using Realplayer.  So be advised.  The only other disc that ever gave me this problem was a Brazilian ""all regions"" disc.  for a 1977 TV movie, this is surprisingly good.  But that's only to say that it exceeds very limited expectations.  The movie tries to dish dirt at the same time it also presents a sympathetic view of a defective human in power.  The dirt is the same old dirt and they try to downplay it by having characters repeat it as hearsay.  They make a point of showing his original office and home, but they are not integrated into the action.

1409969,5,B000059ZXS,"The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover, 1977 film

The story begins with machine guns shooting at targets. Next we see empty rooms. ""I know what to do about the files."" Hoover died. Can Nixon get those files and use them? No, they shredder does its job. There was fear of ""radicals"" after WW One. Suspects were rounded up and put in jail, political repression. Young Hoover asked about conditions and was told to go away. Rule 22 was suspended! We see a romantic event; Hoover is suspicious. [Was this a test?] Attorney-General Stone picked him as the successor to the Bureau of Investigations. Hoover promises to reorganize and select personnel on quality (lawyers and accountants). Publicity helps in their crime fighting. Melvin Purvis shot Dillinger, them became a commercial celebrity (""Junior G-Men""). Hoover arrested Karpis, the last member of the Barker gang. Hoover engineered the arrest of Louis Lepke as a Federal prisoner. We see more about his personal life.

FDR assigned subversive investigations to Hoover. Hoover had to be careful about any romantic involvement, or the lack thereof. Earl Warren rounded up Japanese in California and put them into reservations. [Would they get their property back?] Organized crime replaced the small gangs. After the war Communism became the main menace. Hoover gave information to Senator Joseph McCarthy (who bungled the facts). We see the arrest in New York of a wanted man. Hoover gives a tip to his favorite waiter. ""Its been taken care of."" The election of JFK brought change, RFK became Attorney-General. The Director goes to RFK's office for a meeting. The FBI doesn't recognize Organized Crime. Hoover is well-informed. There is an airline hijacking; the FBI ends it. Hoover wants authority to wiretap M. L. King. Hoover denounces King as a ""liar"". Anonymous letter writers are traced and punished. RFK sends twenty lawyers to a voter registration project. He finds Hoover napping. One agent is punished for being friendly with an employee.

Hoover talks to a widow about Dillinger. She is friendly towards Hoover. ""There are no secrets in Washington."" Hoover listens to tape recordings. JFK arrives in Dallas, and is shot. Hoover tells RFK the news. LBJ (like FDR) loved to read about the personal details of his friends and enemies. Hoover is exempted from the mandatory retirement age of 70. Hoover meets with M. L. King. Hoover hits his target. RFK runs for President and goes to Los Angeles. Can a writer smear Hoover and Tolson? The ""New Left"" became a new target for wiretapping. A man explains how it was done. Is there a trick here? This agent complains about the operations. Giving guns and explosives to radical to create crimes? People demonstrate in Washington. Hoover objects to the ""Huston Plan"" from Nixon. Will they put it in writing? Will Nixon do something about it?

Nixon orders wiretaps on his staff. ""Trust no one?"" But can they do that without Hoover? Who is listening? Hoover finds records missing, and learns who turned them over to Nixon. He acts to remove this assistant. Later that night Hoover become ill. Nature decided it is time to retire. What will happen after Hoover? More scandals? The next minutes tell about the resignations of Agnew, Nixon's staff, then Nixon as well. Who or what caused this? [Could it be Hoover's records?]
The best book on Hoover was written by Curt Gentry. This movie is only an introduction to this once powerful man. It doesn't tell about the support from many corporations.",1327017600,2,3496,4.970940170940171

1409971,5,B000059ZXS,"I went into this film with somewhat diminished expectations.  J. Edgar Hoover's reputation in recent years has been somewhat sullied by our perceptions of what law enforcement should be in this day and age.  I was nine years old when Hoover passed in 1972 so I don't have a first hand opinion of the man.  My image of Hoover was burnished by the foppish turn of Bob Hoskins in Oliver Stone's excreable ""Nixon"".  Clint Eastwood's new film withstanding, which I have yet to see, director Larry Cohen's depiction of the man to me seems even-handed and sympathetic.  Hoover, like all men, was the product of his times.  He had preconceived notions of enforcing the law and he utilized it as he saw fit.  Early in his career as an F.B.I. attorney he saw the greatest threat to the nation's security to be Communism and to his deathbed he never wavered from this conviction.  During the Prohibition when his agents were besieged by thugs with firearms he began employing the tommy gun as a means of keeping the peace.  Post World War II when red paranoia was rampant electronic wiretaps and other means of surveillance were used to maintain order or as popular belief goes to keep his position as the nation's ""top cop"".  His tenure spanned eight administrations though the film focuses primarily on his strained relationship with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and a somewhat testy one with the Nixon White House.  The film stands and falls on the performance of Broderick Crawford and the power of his turn here recalls his Willie Stark in ""All the King's Men"".  Crawford's Hoover is at once tough and hangdog that you are led throughout to believe that he grasped the nation's top law enforcement agency in his pudgy iron fist.  I also liked Michael Parks' take of Bobby Kennedy whose views on civil rights ran counter clockwise to Hoover's.  Like any historical film certain liberties are taken, my main gripe would be the film let's Lyndon Johnson off the hook, otherwise it isn't a bad reference point for those who want to know more about the man whose name is emblazoned on a building that was his personal fiefdom for forty-eight years.",1320969600,2,2143,4.741239892183288
1409972,4,B000059ZXS,"Talk about absolute power corrupting absolutely.  The story of J. Edgar Hoover is the epitome of this saying.  Hoover was a young man when he was tabbed to clean up the corrupt and ineffective ""Bureau of Investigation"" during the Coolidge Administration. His reforms made the FBI the premier law enforcement organization in the world.  But over the years---as he came to accumulate information on many public figures, he became entrenched as head of the Bureau which he considered his personal domain.  Some say that he ""blackmailed"" his way into this position, preying on the moral failings of politicians and entertainment people----all very public people with very private failings.  The irony of course (as many now suspect), was that Hoover himself was gay----but his public stance on such an issue was quite different---some say hypocritical.

If there is a signficant professional failing--it was that Hoover refused to believe that there was organized crime- instead, he focused after the war on fighting communism, even to the extent of assuming that Civil Rights groups (including Martin Luther King) were communist front organizations.  With the impending new Clint Eastwood movie on Hoover, there is renewed attention on the man's life and more attention will be paid on revisiting his actions.

As far as this film, Broderick Crawford is excellent as Hoover and the story told is surprisingly even handed.  It was made only five years after Hoover's death--right on the heels of the Watergate Scandal.  But the movie does give due credit to Hoover's accomplishments---as well as his failings.",1319932800,3,1605,5.258823529411765
7934522,4,B000059ZXS,"PLOT: the rise of J Edgar Hoover~ FBI director for 48 years.

This starts with Hoover (JAMES WAINRIGHT) as a young man. He has a mother fixation. He best skill is organizational and works his way up at the FBI and at age 29 was appointed the head. He quickly makes some rules that everyone has to follow. Men are hired based on skill and merit. Most are lawyers or law enforcement back grounds. He uses his own men to give the FBI a positive slant in the press. The term G Man (Government Man) and Top Cop (Hoover) become every day slang. The FBI quickly develops into a first class investigative force under Hoover. But Hoover loves keep ""secret"" dossiers on every one. Information is power. Rip Torn is an FBI agent who gets on Hoover's bad side and moved from town to town nearly destroying his life. Clyde Tolson (DAN DAILY) is second in charge of the FBI and rumor has it Hoover's lover. A Middle age Hoover (BROADRICK CRAWFORD as the gruff~ cranky~ overbearing Hoover is excellent. His head to head confrontations with Bobby Kennedy his Attorney General Boss, has Hoover using blackmail to keep his job.  Cagey Hoover makes sure Bobby Kennedy signs orders for ""wire tapping"" everyone from the black panthers, to JFK,  Martin Luther King and any one Hoover deemed ""subversive"". The dossiers and tapes keep Hoover in power for 48 years and under 8 presidents. After his death many of his ""private"" files were shredded and destroyed so many  secrets died with Hoover. Interesting, full of stars, This was a TV movie made in 1977. Jack Cassidy, June Havoc, Celeste Homes, Rip Torn, and Lloyd Nolan. The scene stealer here is Crawford as the cagey old ""unbendable"" Hoover and Bobby Kennedy (MICHAEL PARKS) as the pot smoking, beer drinking, liberal Attorney General. Dated, but over all a good entertaining look at Hoover. Based on a bio. 4 STARS~ADDED bonus is watching the crafty Hoover (Broadrick Crawford) manipulate everyone around him.",1493424000,,1942,4.753709198813056

7934531,5,B000059ZXS,"Okay, a little trivia you may enjoy about the film which is FIRST HAND from ME, not Gossip, NOR posted anywhere, but going into MY book not even written yet, and which I lived personally  lol.  In the 70's, I owned, decorated, and ran with Ed Wynn [NOT that little ugly comedian but the famous Cafe Society Icon who was called Duke because he looked just like John Wayne and over 6 feet tall] the NEW """"Stork Club"""" at 112 Central Park South on the ground / street floor of the elegant Navaro Hotel next to the Barbizon, down the block from Plaza hotel, my having bought the rights to the original from Sherman Billingsley's family after he died, when I was going with the man Wynn who was a manager of the Origial Stork, MUCH older than I lol and long before I even knew him yet.... about 35 years older than I, and then he left the Stork because Sherman was a Racist.  My guy opened his OWN """"Harwyn"""" Club which was the FIRST Club in Manhattan or ANYWHERE to allow African American's in because of HIM, which is also in Sammy Davis' book ""Yes I Can"".  Sammy Davis always sang at the Harwyn for FREE, in appreciation for what Wynn did for the entire  United States Cafe Society.  People DESPISED Billingsley.... and that's WHY The Original world famous Stork CLub finally closed, everyone went to the Harwyn.  Wynn also threw Grace kelly and the Prince's Engagement party, being personal friends of Wynn's and later of mine as ell, and also Liz and Eddie's Engagement party too, and many more.  Trying to get through this quickly but seems hopeless  lol...>

I hadn't finished Decorating the NEW Stork yet and they wanted to film scenes in it, so they used the Copa at FIRST, that's WHY you see the RED bankets around the tables.  LOL  My Wynn WAS in that scene, shaking hands with Broderick Crawford as you got up from the table, Ed was the host.  On the table very tiny, was the ORIGINAL Stork wooden BIRD ornament, that I had made from THAT sample, for my club that I had left over from the ORIGINAL Stork which Sherman himself gave me in the 60's along with all the Sortilege perfume, lipsticks and tons of favors he gave out at that time when I used to go there with an ex fiancee, NOT Wynn, Wynn was in his Harwyn by then, I never knew hom yet...>

Jack Cassidy [Known to some as only Shirley Jones' husband,David Cassidy's Dad] IN that scene at the table, playing Damon Runyan with Crawford, took the Stork figure when filming was done, and as someone told me he was leaving, I ran to very charmingly GET it, saying i was the only Prototype i had to reproduce them, and he was darling handing it back.  It was after that last scene that day, that he died.  We were ALL horrified....>

By the NEXE scene, I had finished Decorating my STORK CLUB, and we shot THERE.  But Wynn couldn't appear in it, because he had been in the FIRST Night CLub scene at the Copa  lol not knowing I'd be finished in time to do that scene in the NEW Stork in time but we were.  Where Broderick sat was my famous replica of the Stork's CUB ROOM looking nothing like the OLD one of course, I made this one glamorous where Grace Kelly always sat with the prince, who was there all the time when in NY, [she only ate club sandwiches and beer and took half hom in swan shaped doggie bag  lol, also up in my home often afterwards when the prince wasn't with her in NY.  My parents where in the table in CUB ROOM, whe in black just there for the shooting and other friends... Eddie Duchinn played at the piano most nights but didn't get into the filming.... nor did I walk across the room in my white chiffon floor length gown becasue too shy  lol, NOW I could kill myself.... and that's the story....>'

When the actor who played Ed Wynn's part as the Host ran out of the Stork crying, that was my REAL Canapy.  SO MUCH was NOT printed that they filmsd, which was so depressing.  They sent me a copy of the Video after film was done, now I got the DVD and still love it.  But the scene with my club went too fast.  So sad.  Wyn died decades ago, about 2, in nursing home, we spent 30 years together.  Grace was in love with him before Oleg Cassini and the Prince, which was well known.  Also when Lucy divorced Desi, she called Ed from Vegas to marry HER  lol, he was also involved with Sogne Henni, [sp?].  Everything was in love with my ED, before and AFTER we met.  So sad  This is a mess above, laptop on the brink Ignore mistakes spelling, grammar etc.  OOOOPZ CORRECTION..... """"PETER"""" DUCHIN, NOT Eddie.... Eddie was Peter's FATHER and had been long dead already  lol  Easier to correct downn here than go back all the way up there trying to find it  lol",1399248000,3,4642,4.304147465437788
