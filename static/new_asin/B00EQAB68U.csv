5934187,5,B00EQAB68U,Hot VERY SEXY MOVIE......LOVED IT....!!,1408752000,,39,7.0
5934188,4,B00EQAB68U,"I saw this movie and despite a weak start, it turned interesting and funny for me with the introduction of the character Marco (played by Carlos Luque who made an outstanding performance of the role). He was handsome, hot and funny -maybe you have to be a native mexican spanish speaker to find the fun singularities of the colloquial dialogue, since it gets lost by translation. I think it DOES have a story, but although it's a simple story, it tells about how a trip can change your life. The movie is rated as gay because a kiss between the two characters and in fact we don't need to have nudity or explicit sexual images to understand the background of the story and how this attraction changes everything. Don't expect a movie in Hollywood's or other American ways. It's more like an European independant movie style and you'll love it if you like anecdotic movies.",1402617600,,872,4.632258064516129

5934193,4,B00EQAB68U,"Peyote (2013). Not rated. Running Time: One hour, 11 mins.
Directed by Omar Flores Sarabia. His first independent feature film.

The movie begins with a seventeen-year old, Pablo (Joe Diazzi) playing with his food, a pickle and a tomato. Sitting in his underwear, he then gets bored with social media on the computer. He decides to take his camcorder and goes to the park. At the park, he eats corn-on-the-cob and with his camcorder, records Marco (Carlos Luque) sitting in his car. Marco has a small mirror and reflects sunlight at Pablo. Pablo quits filming him, but Marco is happy about it and goes to Pablo to meet him. He lets him record him again on the swings. Marco is being friendly with Pablo, but Pablo has an edge to him. Then out of appreciation, Marco invites Pablo to have tacos with him. Marco is full of questions. He likes Pablo and invites him to Real de Catorce to find peyote.

No one else is in the cast, but Joe Diazzi and Carlos Luque.

 Carlos Luque certainly has film chemistry and would like to see him in more films.
 The holding for the kiss scene and the long hug was perfect direction. I wish the ending were different. I would like a part 2.

From a gay point of view, don't we all want a friend like ""Marco""?

Language in Spanish with subtitles in English.
The white subtitles sometimes can not be seen because of the scenery. They should have had the subtitles in yellow.

Filmed in Real de Catorce, San Luis Potosi, Mexico.

Come on guys, Please make a Part 2.",1389225600,17,1495,4.466911764705882
5934194,2,B00EQAB68U,"Sad this film deserves so few stars. Actually, it has potential, but all is lost. The two actors are attractive enough, the younger beautiful, and the older, both handsome and sexy as hell, but there is NO story here.

More importantly, on the surface, this is not a gay film, unless you settle for a passing kiss between the two male leads. At the end of the film, in a flashback, I think, the two have a sexual encounter...it's only implied.

The production, the scenery, and the music deserve at least two stars if not more, but no tale is told.

Forget-about-it ! Save your money...",1389052800,7,586,4.509433962264151
5934195,5,B00EQAB68U,"The world of Omar Flores Sarabia's Peyote is a place where vision is at the least double-sighted.  One looks through windows, cameras, computer screens, in and through other's eyes.  Peyote in this movie is not so much a psychedelic as it is the elusive goal of vision, of change.  Like most stories about trips, whether a road trip or a psychological one (this movie, in a sense, contains both), the journey is more important than the goal.  Its value lies in what one sees along the way.  What holds one's attention throughout this film is, first, the clarity, and beauty, of the director's eye.  He does not flinch from staring.  He does not mind being still or moving slowly.  He looks carefully at color, at the design of what (seemingly) is there.  Though there are touches of magic realism in the film, the magic of the film lies in the reality of what is seen, its strange, almost uncanny naturalism.  Yet it is a naturalism always delayed, suspended:  the naturalism of desire.

Marco and Pablo are in many ways opposites, in looks, class, demeanor, manners, attitude.  Yet that is only half true.  They are both alone.  They are both almost wildly (if silently) uncertain of who they are.  This is a two character film.  Save for a couple of instances (the number depends upon on how one reads an image and words on a computer), there is no one else on screen.  They talk about their family, their pasts, though Marco tells Pablo more than Pablo says to Marco.  But how much of what they say is true?  Marco may or may not be lying much or at least some of the time.  They play child-like games, alone or with one another, like keep-away.  They taunt each other, though, again, Marco does more of the mocking than Pablo.  But this is more than games.  Through it all both are being changed in more than just a psychological sense, whatever that phrase might mean.

In the film, place, bleak in some senses, in others brilliant, in many ways stunning and beautiful, is transformative.  For Pablo, in particular, the world into which he rides, walks, runs is an elsewhere, a world outside the confines of his room and his own, in some way, still childhood-bound imagination.  The strangeness of the world to him is what expands him.  Because, at least as Marco tells the story, that world is his own past, it is not so strange to him; it is a world to which he is returning.  Yet sometimes what is new and what is repetition are not that dissimilar when the world, this town, this landscape, pushes back against who you would claim to be.  Both are made more strange to themselves because of where they find themselves.

Do either of them actually ingest peyote?  There is no evidence of it.  Yet there is the experience of it nonetheless.  This, too, is part of the doubling of visions in the film, the unreached goal nonetheless experienced.  Do they make love?  The scene in which they kiss, the long, slow delay of it, the gradual movements of their lips toward one another, is one of the most sensual moments I have ever seen in a movie.  But the fuller realization of their love making is shown only later, when they are apart, in memory, the past and the present enfolded and perhaps, therefore, necessarily imagined, though not (and this is equally important) only imagined.

When Marco shows Pablo where his, Marco's father wanted to have his store, filming it with Pablo's filched camera, is the shot evidence that the story he told to Pablo earlier is true?  Is the image meant to ascertain its reality?  Or does it just add to the fib?  I am not sure such more or less commonplace post-modern reflections (in that word's several senses) are much to Sarabia's point.  Rather, it would seem to be more about how such images themselves are the source of desire, the love between them which, by film's end, seems almost heightened, made more passionate, by their separation.

This is a beautiful film to look at, especially the desert and the old town to which they go.  But both of those places are far more than picturesque.  The two young men, in a nearly archetypal way, travel back and out, stripped down to what changes them.  Both hurt themselves and each other, both bleed, both lie and love.  Through it all, it is a complex visual imagination which watches, filming with an acute sense of detail, clarity, and complexity, nearly always seeing with more than just one pair of eyes.  The young men film each other and are filmed.  In this interplay, together and apart, they come to themselves and back again to each other, at least as far as memory, and imagination, can take them.",1387324800,15,4606,4.599508599508599

5934225,5,B00EQAB68U,"For those of us unfamiliar with Colonial Mexico and its scenery, this terrific little movie offers an extra bonus - gorgeous cinematography. There are only two characters in this movie - no extras, no other people - just the two. Which makes for a tightly focused story with little distraction but the settings and scenery. Pablo comes from a middle class family with money and seems a little spoiled and self-indulgent and seems fixated on his digital camera. Marco's story unfolds a little more slowly, a guy to trust...or not? On a whim the two decide to take a road trip on a search for peyote cactus (the city of Real, where they're headed, is famous for its peyote and the city itself is known as a mystical place, similar to Flagstaff, AZ). The core of the movie is how a simple road trip changes them both forever. Yes, it's a quiet movie, the dialogue is simple, but for me - that was the point of the movie. Life changing events sometimes happen in a whisper. The two leads, Joe Diazzi and Carlos Luque are excellent - they have a really cool chemistry that morphs and changes throughout the movie. For a small indie film, it has the feel of a much larger budget film. If you are familiar with the quietly romantic movies of the popular Argentine director Marco Berger, you'll find a similar feel here - with just a little more color and a little more intensity.",1446249600,,1372,4.514056224899599

I like Pablo's innocence and explorative view on life, and I like Marco's jokester take on everything even though he's hurting inside. They both also had great chemistry.

It did provide some nice images of the countryside, and the two lead characters did a good job of holding your attention in spite of not having much of a script to work with. In the end, however, it wasn't much of a story, and I was left wondering what it's point was.",1434153600,,351,4.253731343283582

5934279,5,B00EQAB68U,filed with metaphors that point to what a conservative hood kid can adventure with an opened mind liberal classy kid. The  expression of manhood. Moral blocked with the assumption of mutual acceptance. Yes I have problems with how my dad is. But also I share emotions with you that feel that there is more beyond a girlfriend.

The story took a little while to reveal itself, but by the end, it had a certain charm. I was also glad the film-makers didn't get too gratuitous with sexual scenes, as it would have served no particular purpose in this film. Some reviewers seemed to imply that any sort of gay-themed film must somehow include explicit sexual scenes. Please. A nice little film. I plan to watch it again.",1433376000,6,512,4.457446808510638

5934293,5,B00EQAB68U,"I have been a bit cynical about Mexican movies in the past but with Peyote I've changed my mind.  The  story is simple but not shallow, the setting in a hot Mexican colonial town is perfect, the two actors who have to carry the weight of the storyline are remarkably talented and the directing is extremely professional.  It is difficult to choose between these two actors as regards their screen persona, etc.  Story-wise, I did not know what to expect,  but as the story unfolds the mingling of these two different lives (one a rather beautiful rich kid, the other a rather greasy in his way attractive but penniless bum), changes them.  The script writer and director have placed them in an emotional cage; neither can escape the harsh reality of their individual lives that they make each other face up to through their emotional battles.  And for God's sake who was the translator of the subtitles?  Whoever he/she may be, this person is a first-class professional with an unusual understanding of modern Spanish-Mexican slang.  I am bilingual and was just awed by the way the translator can get the right nuances and the right English slang equivalent for each and every line.  Just amazing.  This movie is an experience rather than just entertainment that most definitely deserves  five stars.",1420070400,25,1300,4.859090909090909
5934294,5,B00EQAB68U,Very good movie. Joe diazzi and carlos luque gave a great performance.  There's good chemistry between the actors. The storyline is spontaneous.  Great scenery.
