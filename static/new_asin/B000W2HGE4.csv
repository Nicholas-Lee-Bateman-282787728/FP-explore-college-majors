8221057,5,B000W2HGE4,"Great film.  It is not a documentary in the strict sense of the word.  The wonderful Welsh actor, Kenneth Griffith, does more than narrate. He delivers a tour de force in a dynamic and powerful way, changing character before your very eyes, intoning the words of Winston Churchill in his voice and then slyly impersonating Eamon de Valera.  It is clear that Griffith has more than 1916-1922 as his cunning political observations apply as much to the occupied six Counties of northeast Ireland in the years the film was made as they do to the earlier time period. Great historical footage. Loved it.",1426032000,,598,4.786407766990291
8221058,2,B000W2HGE4,"I have long admired Michael Collins' career, and hoped that this video would provide some new insights into the man's life--or at least be entertaining. The fact that the video was ""banned by the BBC"" seemed like a recommendation to me.

If this video was not banned for political reasons, then it should have received a thumbs-down for sheer bad movie-making. The director seems to have used this project to showcase himself--for it consists almost entirely of him speaking intensely, often shouting, into the camera. Clearly, he's very worked up about his subject matter. However, this emotion did not translate into a work that is either illuminating or entertaining.",1251072000,,670,5.146788990825688
