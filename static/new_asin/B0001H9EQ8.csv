8453702,4,B0001H9EQ8,"William Petersen is the reason I ordered this movie. He does not disappoint in this role. The monologue he delivers flawlessly and intensely , and by this point in the movie you are truly invested in his ,slightly psychopathic, mob capo character. He's not in it very much but steals the movie. The rest of the movie was well acted but was a bit drawn out. I thought this was an excellent find, and was impressed .",1489536000,,414,4.3896103896103895
8453703,2,B0001H9EQ8,"Two stars may be a slightly generous rating for this movie, but I'm erring on the side of caution in the event I missed something important in the movie.  Never have I been so suprised a script so weak and confusing could make it all the way to our homes.  I thought Hollywood used test audiences.  My only thought is that maybe most of the movie accidentally ended up on the cutting room floor.

The opening sequence showed great promise - until you realized that none of the dialog had anything to do with the movie and that none of the characters were ever seen again.  As far as I could see, it had no connection at all.  There was lots of emotion, and that emotion was well played by the actors throughout, but they gave you the emotion and later you got the story behind it, so you couldn't understand the emotions at the time they're occuring.  And the worst fault of this movie is that there really is no point or plot.  It was really quite frustrating to watch.

There was one bright spot to the movie and that was William Petersen's performance.  Granted, the point of the character wasn't well established, nor important, but it was a character unlike any other I've seen him play and frankly, if I wasn't looking right at him the whole time, there is no way I could have realized it was him.  As a contrast to the rest of his work, it was the best display of the versatility and talent William Pertersen has to offer as an actor.  He is truly underrated.  I'm just suprised he would be involved in a project this weak.",1145750400,4,1530,4.345070422535211
8453704,2,B0001H9EQ8,"I bought this video as I am a Michael Biehn fan. He is superb in his role, but was gutted when he is only in the long opening sequence. The film itself does have messages in it, mainly about forgiveness and healing. Quite violent, and with average performances from Peterson and Rossi. The great Paul Winfield is great, but again, only in one scene. The film has a great cast, but some what wasted.",1000857600,6,398,4.391891891891892
