8203747,5,B0002XRZ4E,"A Sword and Sandal epic movie centers about Amenhotep IV (Amadeo Nazzari) son of Amenophis III who reigned Egypt . Amenhotep IV was crowned in Thebes and there he started a building program and a new religion , taking on the traditional priests (Vincent Price in one of his most unknown movies) . He married Nefertiti (Jeanne Crain) who loved Tutmes (Edmund Purdom) , sculptor who made the famous bust from her . Amenhotep IV-Akhenaten tried to bring about a departure from traditional religion, yet in the end it would not be accepted . After his death, traditional religious practice was gradually restored .

It's a slice of ancient history set in 1300 B.C. : Amenophis IV is known as Akhenaten or Akhenaton , he was proclaimed maximum priest imposing a sole and , only one , great God : Aton or God Sun , pitting the priests (Vincent Price) followers to Amon Ra . Marriage between Amenophis and Nefertiti would born Tutankhamon . Amenophis created a new city called Ajetaton or Amarna . This is a Peplum style movie with impressive images but including factual errors , as Amenhopis IV changed his name to Akhenaten after converting to the worship of the Aton , and his capital was Akhet-Aton , not Thebes . Jeanne Crain is beautiful , Vincent Price , as always , plays very well a villain person . There are several secondaries and good Italian actors seen in Peplum or Sword and Sandals genre , Musclemen movies and Spaghetti Westerns : Alberto Farnese , Liana Orfei , Umberto Raho, Ralph Baldasarre , among others . Spellbound color cinematography by Massimo Dallamano ensure the glowing spectacle . Set design is breathtaking and Carlo Rustichelli's musical score is excellent . The picture was professionally directed by Fernando Cerchio . The movie gets likeness to 'Sinuhe the Egyptian' but lack luster and budget . Rating: 8 points/10",1525219200,,1846,4.80503144654088

8203749,2,B0002XRZ4E,"A sword and sandal epic that pretty much falls flat across the board. The idea was great and was looking forward to a movie about one of Egypt's greatest queens, but the film is dated in all the wrong ways and Jeanne Crain doesn't make for a particularly memorable ruler of Egypt.",1503273600,,280,4.403846153846154

8203753,3,B0002XRZ4E,"If you're looking for historical accuracy or the grand epic of a Cecil B. De Mille,  you might be disappointed.  A great deal of artistic license has been taken, which is understandable since the archaeological records that refer to Nefertiti's life are very scant.  Therefore, they produced a highly romanticized, highly fictionalized story of a love thwarted by sheer political interests.  Emphasis is made on the troubled romance between

Nefertiti and Thutmose ( the artist who carved her portrait bust now in Berlin ). But I found particularly vulgar the way they portrayed Akhenaten as a religious fanatic to the point of madness,  and the violent confrontation between the Crown and the religious establishment ( both highly Improbable).

I guess this also reflects the understanding of Ancient Egypt in the 1960's when the film was produced. Or perhaps they thought

that would make the film more intense, to balance the slow moments. Likewise, most of the influential characters in Nefertiti's times are not represented. I think they could have written a better, more profound script for this movie.

Still, this movie has its assets, the first of whom is Jeanne Crain, who portrays a lovely, passionate and dignified Nefertiti. Both she and Edmund Purdom ( Thutmose) give a good, if not melodramatic performance considering the quality of the screenplay. Vincent Price was cunning as Benakon, the high

priest of Amun. Amadeo Nazzari played a mentally disturbed Akhenaten effectively, although this character is not given accurate development. But all these actors will be remembered for better roles. There are several nice shots throughout the movie, especially outdoor scenes.

Now the costumes and set designs look good, though not always accurate, as some 60's look is too evident in a few hairstyles

and make-up (was it so costly to make more Egyptian-style wigs??)

This being the scenario, we have Nefertiti ( formerly called Tanit ) as Thutmose's girlfriend. But due to the political ambitions of her father Benakon ( Vincent Price ) she is given in marriage to Akhenaten, heir to the throne of Egypt... but Nefertiti and Thutmose keep seeing each other privately despite all disillusions. Their passion is never to be consummated, for Nefertiti comes to realize the self-sacrifice that comes with being a queen. Not a very unconventional movie, but you may buy it if you are a true fan of Jeanne Crain, or if you really enjoy epic films regardless of its historicity. It certainly is the only film made about NEFERTITI.",1122163200,5,2540,5.106280193236715
