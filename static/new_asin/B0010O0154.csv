8238055,1,B0010O0154,"This looks like an awesome set, but I would NEVER pay 500 dollars for 7 movies!! It has every movie I want, but I wouldn't pay more than 120ish for it. That's like 70 dollars for each movie when I can buy the new 3 disc sets for no more than 30 each. Ridiculous.",1385251200,,262,3.8703703703703702
8238056,5,B0010O0154,"I got this Hayao Miyazaki Box Set back about 4 or 5 years ago for christmas.  My mom picked it up for about $80 at a lcal Blockbuster.  I have watched them over and over again to the extent that I can no longer count.  I can garentee that this is the OFFICIAL LEGAL and ONLY Miyazaki Box Set there is.  It is a Region One and all 7 DVDs come in a metallic silver box.  I wouldnt recomend buying this item from any other users, only from AMAZON itself.  There are many ""Studio Ghibli/ Miyazaki Box Set"" that you can find on sites such as BigTimeMarket.com for like $50 but the quality is poorer than any you will ever see.  If you are willing to go so low as to pay a buck a disk from sites like that then maybe you should just go and illegaly download them off of torrent sites because the quality on many of those downloads are better than any pirated/bootleg movies you will find and sometimes enhanced to better qualities than the disks they were ripped off of.",1293753600,,964,4.178378378378379
8238057,2,B0010O0154,"Don't get me wrong, each of the movies in this set are fantastic, beautiful movies, however, after looking at the price, I noticed that something was amiss.  This is the real reason why I rated this item 2 stars.

Rather than getting this box set (which appears to be of questionable nature, as evidenced by some of the other reviews) for the listed price of $294.31 , I would like to mention to potential buyers that they can get the *SAME* films, purchased individually from Amazon for only $185.92.  That is MORE than $100 cheaper!",1242777600,28,534,4.6
8238058,1,B0010O0154,"Although the picture shows it as a box set and the item description lists this as a ""7 DVD Box Set"", it is NOT a box set.  The seller just sent me all seven movies, still individually-plastic wrapped!
The whole point to getting the box set was to give it as a nice space-saving gift, and now it seems kind of ridiculous to wrap seven different movies.
I contacted the seller (rockyourlife) and am waiting for a reply to the false item description.",1232582400,4,447,4.385542168674699
8238059,5,B0010O0154,"Aside from talk of bootleg copies, Hayao Miyazaki films are enchanting for adults and children.  The story lines are not too complex, but are fraught with dangers and trials that allow the heroines and heros to have wonderful adventures while triumphing over evil and putting the world to rights.  The artwork, especially the scenery, is beautifully detailed, and the characters are not only well drawn, but they also move properly and fluidly, unlike some other anime cartoons that are badly drawn with unnatural movement.  I and my children have enjoyed watching these films many times and I would recommend them to any open minded, artistic families.  Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro are best suited for younger children, as the other films have some violence.  Princess Mononoke is quite gruesome in parts but still a captivating film.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all of these movies.",1221696000,5,902,5.1438356164383565
8238060,5,B0010O0154,"I happen to own this collection, and I just looked it up by typing the exact UPC into the search bar. These are all region ONE dvds, and they are all official releases. It's sad to say, but the person who wrote the one star review calling them bootlegs was most likely ripped off by some dishonest clod.",1209254400,10,303,4.241379310344827
8238061,3,B0010O0154,"As the other review has pointed out, most of the non-Amazon sellers are selling bootleg copies of Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki Box Sets.

However, there IS an official Miyazaki Box Set which is offered through Borders and can be purchased in their stores.  (I don't know how long it will be available, but it was in stores during Christmas 2007).",1206576000,16,340,4.844827586206897
8238062,1,B0010O0154,"There has been no box set offering of region one/english miyazaki/studioghibli DVDs as of 3/2008
There has only been a box set of japanese DVDs and there are even many bootleg copies of that release.
Besides youou could buy all of these DVDs cheaper seperatly and the quality of bootleg DVDs is always poor.
The positive reviews above are almost certainly left by people trying to sell this definite rip off and almost definitley ilegal bootleg.",1205020800,13,445,4.868421052631579
