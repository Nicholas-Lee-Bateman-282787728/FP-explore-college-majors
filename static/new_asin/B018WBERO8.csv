8743174,3,B018WBERO8,"As a person who didn't enjoy the final book, as two films MockingJay did a fairly decent job as a film. I had mentioned to many that the third book in the popular series was hard to follow due to the twist in the story and that it was much more visual. The film gave me the visual aspects that I needed as well as stick close to the story. Of course there are moments that people disliked in the book that the film didn't chance but, what really made me happy was the ending. The reason behind that statement is because unlike the book,, the ending didn't make me feel like all hope was lost.

The cast and the crew did a very good job bringing this popular YA series to the big screen and with so many of these popular book series becoming films it is great to know that the more popular ones are getting the royal treatment.",1486598400,,826,4.130434782608695
