6474338,5,B00L8IDAVE,"Such a crazy, silly old television comedy that makes me laugh almost the whole show!  But, at the same time, this a marvelous period-piece that does an amazing job of show-casing the trade-offs of city- and country-life, which endures even today.  And, even better yet, before our current Trumpist age, this series reveals the tensions between outstanding, amazing immigrants and accomplished, innocent Americans.  When you get tired of watching the real news and the late-night comic sarcastic commentaries, try Green Acres!  It takes me away to an innocent time when America looked at wealth and immigrants in a very different and much healthier way!",1487548800,3,652,5.240384615384615

8664321,3,B00L8IDAVE,"We like Green Acres but we just ordered Season 2 and haven't watched it yet - we are wondering why it says ""For Mature Audiences"" on the cover!  We are a rather conservative family and we do not have TV - but we do watch some old shows like this on DVD.  When we saw that sticker warning we were wondering - what on earth is in this season that would make them say that?  Anyone know?",1508284800,,384,3.961038961038961

8664323,5,B00L8IDAVE,I'm a big fan of the Green Acres show so my wife bought me season 2 and 3 as a gift. (We already had Season 1.) We are both enjoying watching them from time to time. It's interesting how much some things have changed and some haven't in the 50 years since the shows were aired.,1503619200,,277,3.9642857142857144
8664324,5,B00L8IDAVE,"One-sided discs packaged satisfactorily. Audio  and video excellent. Lisa just as charming, Oliver just as perplexed, as I remember them from 50 years ago.
Speaking of being perplexed, ""Donald (?) I love you, but give me Park Avenue"".",1497830400,2,234,5.157894736842105
