8288271,5,B001CNGPF8,"This book must be read at least 3 or 4 times to appreciate it's greatness. With life changing ideas like: ""Life doesn't bring you joy, you bring joy to life"" and insights such as: "" Don't confuse fame with greatness, fame is about what you do for yourself, greatness is about what you do for others.""

This book is also perfect for anyone who has been burned by a church before. Erwin shares what a real church would look like if people can just get out of their own way.

Amazing read!",1352937600,,486,4.271739130434782
