the air.",1364256000,,117,3.875
1844997,1,B00008G8P3,"Since all the episodes of BONANZA in this cut-rate release are now available officially from CBSHE (CBS Home Entertainment) and Paramount distribution (and ""cut"" is the right word, as the original theme song is missing from all episodes and the picture quality is sub-par), there's absolutely no reason to buy this unauthorized set! (This is NOT a ""Best of"" collection. It's the exact same limited number of episodes from the first and second seasons that bootleggers have been floating around for years.) Buy instead -- if you haven't already -- the ""Real Deal,"" with digitally remastered and restored picture and sound (from the original 35 mm film elements), the ORIGINAL music plus tons of extras not available elsewhere.

1844998,5,B00008G8P3,My husband is a big fan and I got him a few different DVD's of the old western shows that used to be on TV.  He was thrilled!,1359331200,,125,3.4642857142857144
1844999,5,B00008G8P3,I purchased this DVD for my husband's birthday who is a HUGE western fan.  He stated he is very satisfied with this DVD!,1359158400,,120,4.217391304347826
1845000,4,B00008G8P3,"I have always liked Bonanza! And who wouldn't with little Joe :) haha. Was happy with the shipping, and the item arrived in perfect condition. It wasn't packaged like I thought it was going to be. The dvd's were in individual dvd slip covers and slide securely in a pocket-type square place in the dvd case. I'm not thrilled with how it is just because it's more of a bother to get to the bottom dvds, you have to take out the others to get to it but it's not bad. Just personal opinion. Overall I'm happy with it.",1357689600,3,514,4.202020202020202
1845001,5,B00008G8P3,Wish it were a complete season but not a bad deal for 32 episodes.  Overall i give it 5 stars bc it really was a great price and i enjoyed the episodes,1356480000,,151,3.71875
1845002,4,B00008G8P3,"First of all this is a good Bonanza dvd set.  I deducted one star because it's not perfect.  The picture is sort of grainy and it's not the original theme song which I knew beforehand.  However, for the price and it being 32 episodes, it's a great price and sort of a ""why not"" purchase.  As you long as you know those things, it's a good set.  I can see if you are hardcore fan and wanting the original season sets but for a casual watcher, etc, this is great.",1349481600,8,461,4.0777777777777775
1845003,5,B00008G8P3,This is a fantastic collection of Bonanza!!  I have enjoyed sitting back and relaxing with the more gentle era of hour long shows.  The quality of the dvd and the quality of the sound is great.  I feel like I'm watching Bonanza on the color portable tv of  days gone by.  I LOVE IT!!!,1330041600,8,284,4.185185185185185

1845097,1,B00008G8P3,"This collection does not even deserve one star. The theme song at the beginning is missing, and the picture quality is very poor. It doesn't seem like the Bonanza we all know and love. It is a total waste of money.",1430784000,,214,4.2439024390243905

1845131,5,B00008G8P3,I really enjoyed watching these old television shows. Brings back good childhood memories as soon as I hear the music. The entire family squeezed together on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and Bonanza. Just can't beat it!,1424649600,,227,4.7

1845136,4,B00008G8P3,"Bonanza: Adventures With The Cartwrights is a re-release DVD set of The Best Of Bonanza, put out by Mill Creek Entertainment, an entertainment company that puts out all sorts of great releases at affordable prices. Adventures With The Cartwrights features all 31 episodes of Bonanza (The last 17 episodes of Season 1 and first 14 episodes of Season 2) that are public domain. Due to music copyright, these episodes have a generic Western tune used in the opening/conclusion instead of the classic Bonanza theme. In addition, these public domain episodes have decent picture quality at best and may have some very slight edits compared to the original broadcast versions. This release also features some bonus material, which includes an episode of Wagon Train and a Bonanza documentary. (The original Mill Creek release The Best Of Bonanza has three episodes of Wagon Train and no documentary.)

For five bucks, this is a very affordable and recommended collection of classic Bonanza episodes and an ideal way to get all 31 public domain episodes in one case. I found the episodes to be completely watchable/enjoyable with good SD picture/sound quality. I've watched them on a regular SD tube TV and a HDTV with no problems whatsoever. Each disc is kept in a sleeve which is stacked inside the case, which helps preserve the center of the discs. This is a great purchase for the casual Bonanza fan or someone looking for an affordable deal on 20+ hours of classic Western television.

If you are interested in seeing these episodes in their original broadcast format, be sure to check out the Paramount releases, which have the original theme music and more. Either way you watch it, Bonanza is a true American classic and one not to be missed!",1416873600,2,1744,4.928571428571429

1845139,5,B00008G8P3,Bonanza is my favorite of the old TV westerns.  This included some good eps from the first seasons.  Fun to watch.,1402444800,,114,4.380952380952381
1845140,1,B00008G8P3,"Read all the 1 & 2 star reviews before buying.  They are all correct.  The picture quality is subpar.  The theme song is some old 50's western guitar song.  Some of the transitions between scenes & acts overlap or jump around.  The best comment I've read is ""if you're happy with VHS to DVD quality, spend the $4.98"".  I suggest you won't be.",1400544000,4,342,4.349206349206349

1845165,4,B00008G8P3,I enjoy looking at these old western movies of Bonanza. I can look at these movies for over and over.,1389830400,,101,4.1
1845166,1,B00008G8P3,"Took a chance (found for $5 in Menards' bargain bin) but useless at ANY price; refund, here we come.

I see another reviewer praises Mill Creek Entertainment (distributor) for their work in compiling such bargain sets and explains the legality (evidently these 32 episodes are now in public domain - unlike the missing music, still copyright protected).  That was helpful info, for at least they're not illegal ...  yet ... no interest in hanging onto these pebbly, edited vids that lack even the famous Bonanza theme music.

Missing music and multi-generation loss were not disclosed in product packaging, so it didn't even occur to me they would lack the original music.  Wow!",1389484800,,678,5.017857142857143
1845167,3,B00008G8P3,"By the looks of the front cover you might be led to believe the episodes also have good sound and pic quality. Not so! Most of the set has a grainy picture and sound quality is inferior. If you don't like the ""Trasferred from vhs to disc look"" do not buy it. There is only 1 disc that has  decent picture and sound however you do get 32 episodes and it's dirt cheap so it's a trade off in my opinion.",1379894400,,400,3.9382716049382718
1845168,5,B00008G8P3,"I have loved this series since I was a child!  When I first remember hearing of this series, it was one that my parents watched on TV every Sunday evening.  My brother and I were sent to bed first, though.  :>(  The box and video labeling are great!  The duplication process produced a quality product.  All of the menu items work.  I just wish there were more episodes to purchase.  If there were, I would purchase them.  When I get tired of these, I will tuck the DVD away and bring it out again in six months or so.  Then I'll enjoy watching them all over again.",1378166400,2,565,4.196261682242991
1845169,5,B00008G8P3,"I loved these episodes. You can tell from some of the earlier ones that the actors were still finding their take on these classic characters but still, I loved them, every one. You will enjoy.",1377216000,,192,4.514285714285714

1845172,1,B00008G8P3,The music wqasn't even from the original program.  A BIG disappointment for me....I would never order anything like this again.  A poor copy of something I would never order again....,1374278400,4,183,5.066666666666666

7983283,3,B00008G8P3,"This collection consists of season 1, episodes 19 to 32 (The Gunmen to Death at Dawn) and season 2, episodes 1 to 17 (Showdown to The Spitfire).  I don't know why the distributor decided to take a snapshot of these particular episodes, but I am happy they had the good sense to provide 32 episodes in order by air date rather than some random selection of episodes.  Also included are a Wagon Train episode called The Dr. Denker Story (from season 5, episode 18) and a 22 minute special called, The Story of Bonanza.  I received this 32 episode set as a gift. I would suggest purchasing the episodes by season so you have everything leading up to episode 19 as well as everything after season 2 episode 17.",1522454400,,706,4.457364341085271
