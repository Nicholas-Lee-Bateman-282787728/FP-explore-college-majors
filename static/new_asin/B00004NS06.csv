8388154,5,B00004NS06,"This fabulous concert video is all the more special and valuable now that Smokey Montgomery has ""gone home..."" This is a Light Crust Doughboys' concert, full of ad-libs and surprises and no ""set"" play list---just like their famous shows! It features Smokey at the end of his life, as fantastic of a picker as ever! As an instructional video, this could be a $60. import, but it's not, it's not! The video also features the famous styles of super-bassist Art Greenhaw, best-in-the-west fiddler John Walden, and the rest of the heroic Doughboys. As an added bonus, we get to see and hear Art's musical mentor, James Blackwood, plus a fine set if performed by the gospel Bob Wills Family. Wonderfully-professional camera work, filming, video, and audio makes you feel like you're front row center. Smokey and The Light Crust Doughboys are as close to you ALWAYS as your ""play"" button with this video. This video, FULL CIRCLE, was actually my first Light Crust Doughboys purchase, and then I just had to have their CDs as soon as they come out on Amazon.comThis music is the most contagious I've ever heard! The Light Crust Doughboys are...FOREVER!",997488000,,1144,4.871794871794871
