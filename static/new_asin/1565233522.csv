7796473,4,1565233522,"Watching this DVD is like spending an hour with a master craftsman, sitting in his shop while he shows off his tools, talks about joinery and his time in the trade, and shows you a thing or two. That is wonderful. Kingshott demonstrates the basic aspects of his particular method, including layout, marking, sawing and paring. He has super sharp tools, as is evidenced by the effortless way he pares through mahogany end grain.

Now the downside: Kingshott does not go into great detail on exactly HOW he uses his tools effectively, so beginners will have to closely examine the video and most likely look elsewhere for basic sawing and paring fundamentals. Also, Kingshott only demonstrates a half-blind dovetail joint, explaining that if you can do a half-blind dovetail, the through-dovetail will be easy. IMHO, it would have been better to have BOTH of these common types of dovetail joints demonstrated. An extra 15 minutes are all that would be needed to include a second demonstration.

Side note: The cover photo of the Dovetail joint on my DVD case is quite ironic, since it appears to be a machined dovetail joint and looks nothing like Kingshott's refined ""cabinetmaker"" pin style layout that is demonstrated.",1365984000,2,1220,4.9754901960784315
