7891175,5,6305435421,"This is an excellent video for the competing karatekas out there.

The video is professionally produced -- footage is of excellent quality for a VHS and the camera work is superb.

The instructors have several years of competing and coaching under their (black) belts and it certainly shows.

This part of the series focuses on the counterattacks with punches, kicks and combinations. You will learn how to dissipate the power of the opponent's attack and even how to use it against him. The variety of combinations and drills is sure to keep you busy for a while.

I recommend getting the entire series:

""Winning Competition Karate"" - VHS

""Winning Counterattacks"" - VHS

""Winning Kicking Techniques"" - VHS

I also strongly recommend DVDs by Alexandre Biamonti, WKF World and European Champion:

""Karate - The Art of Fighting""

""Competition Winning Techniques by Alexandre Biamonti""",1162425600,,884,5.161971830985915

7891177,4,6305435421,"I purchased this tape after buying the sister tape on kicking.  The first one was pretty good but this one is better.  The techniques are not new by any stretch of the imagination and are taught in many a dojo, but the  demonstrations are clear and clean and I was able to sneak a few ideas  under my belt after watching them.  The naration is marginal but thankfully  limited since the pictures tell the story.",960422400,,411,4.413333333333333
