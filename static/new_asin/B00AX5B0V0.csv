5524978,4,B00AX5B0V0,"I have always liked Adam-12.  I remember watching it in the original in the 60s and 70s before it got all cut up to add more commercials.  Imagine a 30 minute show with actually 25 minutes of show (including the opening/closing credits)!

However, this is not the ""collection"" implied in the name ""Classic Collection"".  That implies what some one or some group has decided to be either the best or the most popular 13 episodes from among all 7 seasons.  What we have, in actuality, is the first 13 episodes of the 3rd season -- that's it!  It's just the first 2 disks of the Season 3 set.

The nice part is it does include my all time favorite of all the episodes -- Log 105 - Elegy for a Pig.  That is the one episode without the music or standard opening credits.  It starts with ""Adam-12"" on a black background. I ordered this set on the hope it would include that one episode after finally finding a negative review that it was only the one season.  I had already determined that the episode I wanted was third season.

What I could NOT find anywhere was a list of the 13 episodes included on this set. So, to help other potential buyers, I am listing those 13 episodes.

Disk 1:

Log 174 - Loan Sharks
Log 35 - Easy, Bare Rider
Log 95 - Purse Snatcher
Log 45 - Bright Boy
Log 65 - Cigarettes, Cars and Wild, Wild Women
Log 55 - Missing Child

Disk 2:

Log 75 - Have a Nice Weekend
Log 105 - Elegy for a Pig
Log 25 - Indians
Log 135 - Arson
Log 96 - Pilgrimage
Log 85 - Sign of the Twins
Log 175 - Con Artists

One other negative -- The tin is nice but the ""velvet"" holder for the disks sheds and leaves little black lint on the disks.  That is not usable.  I took my own slim double-disk case to hold the two disks and I'll use the nice tin (embossed with the name and the figures of Malloy and Reed) for something else.",1439251200,18,1825,4.092957746478874

Something the newspapers never discuss or Suburbanites ever think about living in what they believe is a safe world.
