Daddy Warbucks has Annie at his huge estate with Sandy, her big dog,  It seems Daddy is more like Scrooge this season.  He is irrated and crabby---so cranky that Annie runs off into the night with her beloved Sandy.  Punjab tells Warbucks Annie is gone!!  and that this event is unlucky and will upset the Grand Order of things.  So, Warbucks and Punjab  take off searching for missing duo.  An adventure begins and the rest you must find out for yourself because I don't want to give the plot away!!!  This is a super-duper Christmas VHS and not easily found.  Originated in Canada.  Definitly worth buying for the family!!!",1389225600,,698,4.733333333333333
