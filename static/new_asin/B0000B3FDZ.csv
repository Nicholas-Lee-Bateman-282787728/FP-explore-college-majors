7998045,3,B0000B3FDZ,"I have seen a lot of Dragonball, Dragonball Z, and now I have seen everything released (legally) of Dragonball GT. All three series have changed (Dragonball has Roshi being a pervert, Z has more blood, etc. etc.), but GT doesn't really seem to be a big change from the other two. There aren't really many perverted jokes (if any), and the violence isn't worth putting the 13+ sticker on it.
What is this series worth, then? I think the plot as a whole is a little more mature than the other series have been, not just people running around and taking seven episodes to charge a spirit bomb. Baby is a worthy enemy, even though he is defeated the same as all of the other enemies in the past. The moustache episode is great, for those who know what I'm talking about. Basically, when the series is good, it's great; and when it sucks, it sucks.
Back to things I have issues with about the series. The DVDs are overpriced for how many episodes are on a single DVD, and the episode titles and numbers are not listed on the front or back of the DVD cover, so if you didn't know what you were doing, you wouldn't know what you were getting. Perfect example would be myself: I have browsed through stores for the past year or so, and spotted DBGT DVDs, and havn't bought any. Over the past couple of months, I decided to get one to start with. I was in the store and didn't do my online research, so I didn't know exactly what I was getting (episode wise). I made a prayer and bought the DVD (Annihalation), and came home to realize it had episodes 20-22. Attempting to jump into the episodes didn't work, so I decided that in order to understand, a couple other DVDs would be needed. Personally, I didn't feel the Affliction DVD was necessary and did a poor compilation of episodes 1-16 (Japanese) into episode 1 (English). It was almost a waste of time to see Goku battle Rilldo. Once Baby is brought into the series is when it is worth buying (Baby comes into play in episode 7). Rilldo and Dr. Myuu should have all been crammed onto one DVD, so fans wouldn't have to suffer through it, or maybe just catch them on tv or rent them. All of this confusion was overwhelming, so I broke down and bought the other 7 DVDs, ranging in price. ($14.97 Salvation and Annihalation at Walmart...thank you Walmart, $19.97 for Ramifications and Preparation at some other department store, and $24.95 for Affliction, Incubation, Creation and Proliferation in the mall because no other store carried them.) As you can see, this was a costy affair, and also throwing a lot of money around. (Hell, I may just sell them to someplace for at least some of the money back.) It could all be put on 3 discs for at most $60 and I would have been much happier.
Also a big factor: Where is the gore??!! Five year old children could watch this and think it as the same stuff they show on Cartoon Network. My first DVD didn't have the 13+ sticker on it, and after one episode, I immediately thought it to be edited. I guess the only parts that would be worht editing would be nudity, but kids think asses are funny! They always show asses in cartoons, so why would it be edit-worthy in this series? It's not, to tell you the truth. There is other anime that doesn't even have the sticker that actually should (i.e. Eva...bless you Evangelion). When you go in buying these things, you think you are going to get some great unedited stuff here. That's what I find annoying about the whole affair.
So, after all my rambling, to sum up...
  Baby, in itself, is a great saga. Gen. Rilldo and Dr. Myuu, however, were a waste of time and money. (Rilldo was uncannily similar to Cell.) The DVDs don't show the episodes on it, and they are severely overpriced. Dragonball GT also follows the fighing ""formula"" as its predecessors:
Goku meets enemy + Goku punches enemy rashly and enemy lets it go by + enemy takes on a new form and beats the crap out of Goku + Kais and others watch and go ""OH MY GOD, WILL GOKU LIVE?"" + Goku goes to another Super Saiyan form + Enemy is surprised + the enemy and Goku are evenly matched and fight for a while = eventually Goku wins and there is a pointless episode or two following the defeat of the enemy.
That's the formula. Repetitive, yet addicting.
Suggestion: Watch them on tv, rent them, or borrow them and watch the series. See which episodes you like, do your research, and buy the DVDs with the episodes you liked most on them (from a Used place hopefully). You will find more money in your pocket, and a bigger smile on your face knowing you saved a lot of money. OR, get hooked on another anime series...try Tenchi Universe, Cowboy Bebop, Evangelion, Trigun or Hellsing.",1069545600,11,4675,4.428571428571429
