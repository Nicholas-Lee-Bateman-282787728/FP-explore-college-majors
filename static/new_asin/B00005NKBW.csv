7947528,5,B00005NKBW,"When I started collection anime back in the 1990s, there wasn't a whole lot out on the market at the time, but I started with Animego with their release of Bubblegum Crisis and worked my way to an insane series called Urusei Yatsura.  Like with their releases, you get a lot of linear notes which explains a good deal of the jokes and cutural differences which helps a Westerner such as myself to understand the humor better.

Nothing finer than to spend a quiet afternoon with your favorite snack and a few episodes of a classic.  Give UY a try.  :)",1402963200,,550,4.415841584158416
7947529,4,B00005NKBW,"I've been a huge fan of Lum from the very first episodes. It's so silly and wacky but what's enduring is Lum's relentless love for Ataru and how he grows into it..

Beware if you are remotely into rom coms. This one is very, very long and ridiculously satisfying.",1352073600,,263,4.36734693877551
