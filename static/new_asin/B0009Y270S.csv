2337918,5,B0009Y270S,This DVD is excellent. It teaches very important lessons to kids of all ages. The kids are going to learn through catchy songs that you will be singing in no time and with visiual aids. As a Hispanic father with a kid growing with both the American and Hispanic culture this is your best buy. The DVD is all in Spanish. It gets 4 and 3/4 of star from me just because it doesnt have the number or letter of day.,1143244800,50,410,4.074074074074074
2337936,2,B0009Y270S,I tried this for my 2 yo who promptly became bored and picked up a book (a good thing).  I was hoping to use it for a trip but ended up leaving it at home.,1392422400,,155,3.4285714285714284

2337938,5,B0009Y270S,"What can I say? This is a Sesame Street Workshop productions, and to find one that showcases Spanish was a struck of luck. There aren't many out there, which is a shame. I grew up with Plaza Sesamo, the Spanish version, and I am glad I can give my child wonderful memories too.",1388275200,,277,4.245283018867925
2337939,5,B0009Y270S,"I purchased this for my 1 year old son, and he LOVES it! All of the words written AND spoken are in Spanish and it is LONG! I am looking forward to purchasing the other Plaza de Sesamo videos. I would recommend this to ANY child trying to learn Spanish. Even my older children that are 11 and 12 enjoy it.",1382572800,,305,4.016393442622951

2337941,5,B0009Y270S,"Interesting stories for the small ones, and well written.
Many songs, dances and characters. Made with the same quality of Sesame Street in English.
Sesame Street conveys values in children than other TV shows do not.
Presenting children of all races, nationalities and physically different.
We must teach our children diversity and tolerance at an early age, and if besides learning they have fun, even better!!
My 2 year niece loved it!",1376611200,,438,5.097222222222222

2337944,5,B0009Y270S,"So far, my English speaking daughter has only attempted to sing the tagline ""Me Gusta, Me Gusta Ser Yo!"" but since she's pretty young, we're thinking this is a good sign. Although the DVD is poor quality, it's still a production that catches her eye.",1366156800,,250,4.5777777777777775
2337945,3,B0009Y270S,But we expected the dialog to be more clear. The action is engaging and the DVD works fine.  Thank kyou.,1364688000,,104,4.2
2337956,4,B0009Y270S,Wish it had english subtitles.  I shared it with her spanish speaking daycare and all of the kids really enjoyed it.,1363651200,,116,4.523809523809524
2337957,5,B0009Y270S,We have to watch some of this every night. My son learned his body parts in just a few days.,1360108800,,92,3.65
2337958,5,B0009Y270S,My daughter is 2 and she loves this video. She imitates everything while she is watching it and he laughs a lot. I wish they will have more Elmo or new version of sesame street in spanish.,1358294400,,188,4.108108108108108
2337959,4,B0009Y270S,"Like any Sesame Street episode, this video is split up into short skits.
Some of them are re-used material from old Sesame Street episodes from the 1980s and they just dubbed Spanish-speaking music over it.
Other skits that have puppets (Cookie Monster) are also old skits with the voices dubbed over in Spanish.
The only skits that appear to be original content have low production values on cheap-looking sets.
However, it's still the same quality content you'd expect from Sesame Street, so it gets four stars.
Due to its low price, it's a good value for an immersion Spanish video.",1356825600,,585,4.86
2337960,3,B0009Y270S,"It all depends of what you are looking for as to whether this product is good for you.  My granddaughter is 12 months and is not yet speaking.  I am interested in teaching her Spanish even though I don't speak Spanish.  I am learning along with her.  This DVD is for native speakers or for older children, at least 3 or 4.  I wanted simple vocabulary development, learning basic words and simple sentences, etc.  This is full blown conversation and skits - typical Sesame Street fare.  One day, we will be there, but not yet, so it all depends on what you are looking for.  For sure, the price is right:0)  Madison's Grammy",1355875200,3,623,4.442477876106195
2337961,5,B0009Y270S,my son loves this video. He is bilingual and he has learned so much from this video I only wish I would have bought this earlier,1354838400,,128,3.9615384615384617
2337962,5,B0009Y270S,The video is exactly like Sesame Street in english the program is great for introducing new vocabulary and understanding the words in Spanish.  I bought this for my five year old son.  Although I recommend getting the alphabet because knowing the sounds of each letter is important in Spanish pronuncation.,1353628800,,306,5.1
2337963,4,B0009Y270S,"Great DVD - just wish it had subtitles at bottom of the screen.  I'm trying to teach my 28 month old Spanish.  This is a Great DVD.  but wish were Enlgish Or Spanish subtitles at the bottom, so I can help my child (and myself figure out what's being said).  I've been learning Spanish for a while now, so I'm getting good, but not that good, and I'm still learning myself. And he knows alot hiself - but we are both still learning. However, this DVD is one of my child's favorite's, because we have over 30 Seaseame Street Dvd's and he loves all the characters, so even though he/we don't understand everything it's still a favorite.  I've given it 4 stars because It would have been nice to have subtitles.  Great for a Toddler in a Spanish speaking household!!",1350086400,,762,4.4071428571428575

2337965,5,B0009Y270S,"My child is 8 months old in a bilingual home. This video is perfect for those who know at least a little spanish. If you are a parent, trying to teach your child spanish; this is not for you. Your child, before the age of one, can learn virtually any language you throw at them. stay persistent and keep speaking spanish, even if you don't know alot of it, learn commands, colors, and numbers etc for your child. This video will capture their curiousity and they will pay attention. Great songs as always :)",1339977600,,507,4.404255319148936

2337987,3,B0009Y270S,"My son is annoyed by this DVD :( he won't even watch it. Got him to watch it once, but no luck :(

he LOVES Spanish for Kids: Adentro y Afuera though.

I must say, my intent for purchasing these is to help reinforce the Spanish I speak to him, since my husband doesn't speak it.",1335657600,2,278,3.9464285714285716

2337990,5,B0009Y270S,"We have a series of Plaza Sesamo episodes, many of which I downloaded from itunes and are more recent. However, we keep going back to this one. My son LOVES it. The main song is a classic and we find ourselves (parents, grand parents, nanny) signing the "" Me Gusta Ser Yo"" song.  It's one of the most educational shows, teaches about the parts of your body and more importantly, it's all about how happy you are with your self and your looks.

2337992,5,B0009Y270S,"My toddler loves this DVD! As a warning, this is not a DVD that teaches Spanish. For that, try their ""Fiesta"" DVD. This is geared towards toddlers who already understand Spanish. I love the positive self-esteem theme of this entire DVD. As with a lot of Sesame Street products, we see kids of all different shapes, colors, and abilities and they all sing all to ""me gusta ser yo!"" (I love to be me!). I love hearing my toddler say this at such a young age.",1308182400,7,456,4.313953488372093
2337993,4,B0009Y270S,"A fun DVD for a review of basic body parts - I used it in PreK - 3rd grade intro Spanish classes - broke it down to 15-20 minute showings - some skits were a hit, some were not - it did keep the students' attention - even though they did not understand all of the espanol.",1304640000,,272,3.789473684210526
2337994,5,B0009Y270S,"Me Gusta Ser Yo was such a hit at my home that when we misplaced the DVD for several months (someone decided to put it in ""the basura""?), we went and bought another copy.

Most bits last only a couple of minutes at most, so kids don't lose focus. Parts of the body and diversity are taught. My boys love this, especially clips with the muppets. I can't think of any reason not to give it 5 stars! So much better than Barney or Teletubbies!",1231891200,,439,4.1647058823529415
2337995,5,B0009Y270S,"Plaza Sesamo is my daughter's absolute favorite, in fact, it is the only show she gets excited for as soon as she hears the Intro music.  She has been this way for the past 9 months.  When I finally found Me Gusta Ser Yo online, a DVD about 55 minutes whereas all of the others, with the exception of Vamos a Cantar which I also purchased, are about 25 minutes.  As she gets older her attention span needs to be longer so this is perfect.  The music is cute and from what I understand of the message, it is important to instill the concept of liking yourself from such a young age.  I recommend this DVD to all children, Spanish speaking or not.  The DVD also shipped quickly and my daughter watches it almost every morning for the past month so it is holding up well.",1231632000,,768,4.226027397260274
2337996,5,B0009Y270S,"We're a Hispanic family doing our best to raise our 1 year old son bi-lingual. To help us do this, I've researched and purchased several different Spanish children's DVD's such as some of the A La Vibora De La Mar and from the Osmosis line. This one ranks #1 out of all for me and our son. He adores it. Great translations. Great lessons for his age. Very entertaining and educational. Absolutely perfect. My only complaint is that they don't have more like it for his age. I also purchased the Bienvenidos Primavera, but I don't think he's quite ready for it. It's probably for a slightly older child. - So if your torn about which Spanish videos to get, go with this one first. I should have known that you can't really go wrong with Sesame Street.",1214265600,36,750,4.442028985507246
2337997,5,B0009Y270S,"For an adult studying Spanish at a beginner's level, I loved this video.  So much that I ordered 3 more Plaza Sesamos.

First, these shows are not intended to teach Spanish to anyone.  Just like Sesame Street, they're intended to teach children.  For this video, they concentrate of teaching the different parts of the bodies.

But because they're intended for children they don't speak too quickly or use extremely difficult words.

I found this video very enjoyable and educational.",1204848000,9,484,5.063291139240507
2337998,4,B0009Y270S,"It's Sesame Street. What can I say. I like it. My baby likes it. Most importantly, the Spanish they use is good Spanish and that's what I want my daughter to learn, so I'm a satisfied customer.

2337999,3,B0009Y270S,"English-speaking parents note: Plaza Sesamo not designed to teach Spanish. Like English Sesame Street, it engages and entertains kids who already speak Spanish. (Grover is HILARIOUS in any language.) This DVD focuses on body parts. Good for vocabulary reinforcement. The videos of actual kids show a diversity of Latino images. My boys shout each others' names when they see a child that looks like their brother.  (One has blonde hair, blue eyes, pale skin. The other has brown hair, eyes and skin.) The live-action studio segments have very scripted, somewhat unnatural child actors - my kids don't seem to relate to them. The animated segments like the Spider Picasso and Teeth Brushing Orchestra are really fun for our toddlers. Gracias Plaza Sesamo",1198800000,22,753,5.172131147540983
2338000,3,B0009Y270S,"I rated this item in the lower range because I though my 2 1/2 year old could learn more spanish with this video. Definitely is designed for kids that are already fluent in the language. The conversation is quite difficult to follow for a 2 1/2 year old who is just learning spanish. Perhaps is for older kids 4 or 5. However, it does entertain my toddler and she likes all the characters in the video.

8070209,5,B0009Y270S,"It is good as a Spanish resource.
The Spanish is Mexican and it is not dubbed.
The main goal is to teach the body parts and feeling good about yourself how you are.
For non fluent Spanish speaking children it is better to watch with someone that knows Spanish to ask questions during the video and make sure the child is getting the body parts vocabulary (if they are at that age stage).  Because it is a regular sesame street episode, characters speak fast for a non Spanish speaker.
It is still funny and entertaining even if the child can not understand everything.",1476057600,,568,4.514563106796117
