8250985,4,B0013H86L4,"Typical Aussie kids interacting at school and with family members. In constant fear of being embarrassed by classmates or parents. The main character, Taylor Fry is a pleasant 12 year old girl who believes all her family to be a constant embarrassment. Of course THEY do not realize that they are whacky nor do THEY realize each OTHER to be weird. Taylor is the only one who sees them for what they truly are ... crazy.

A diverse cast of family and friend characters with unique quirks and odd traits and professions allow for some wild fun and hilarity. If only Taylor could chill out.

Very family friendly plots and dialog. No profanity, violence, nudity, gore or disturbing imagery. Safe for all ages. A lot of fun to watch. Interesting. Not sappy. Plots are not predictable.",1371600000,,780,4.727941176470588
8250986,5,B0013H86L4,"This season 1 box set was released by Madman Entertainment, Australia in 2006. Getting the two region 4 DVDs to play on my computer took some time, but finally I managed. The DVDs are rated PG, mild incidental coarse language.

Mortified is a series for teens that also adults will enjoy. Taylor Fry, a vivid 11 year girl with shining eyes and flamboyant imagination, has to face her often quite embarrassing parents, her beautiful (and sexy) older sister Layla and her perfect neighbours. Taylor is accompanied by the neighbour's daughter Brittany and her loyal friend Hector. The reasonable and calm Hector often has to suffer because of Taylors extraordinary ideas. He secretly is in love with Tayor and reminded me a lot of Freddie in ICarly.

Taylor's family lives right next to the sea, people walk around barefoot most of the time. The 13 episodes are filmed at the beach, at the Fry's home and in School, where the children all are wearing blue uniforms.

Fans of Hanna Montana, Zoey101 or ICarly will love Mortified! It is strange that this set has not been released in the US or Europe yet...

In the first episode ""Taylor's DNA"" Taylor tries to prove that she is not related to the rest of her embarrassing family.

Through out the first season Taylor is learning to surf to impress her crush Leon, trying to prevent her mother to display a nude self portrait, avoiding ""the talk"" with her parents, attending a martial arts class because of the handsome master, becoming member of the children's soccer team, trying to escape from earth, turning bad to get more attention, finding out that just being herself is the best way to go through life.

The last episode ""Leaving Primary"" is one of the best. On the beach Taylor, Hector, Brittany and Leon swear to stay friends forever even though they will all visit different high schools. Taylor holds a touching goodbye speech at primary school. The children applaud to their teacher Mr. McClusky, who is portrayed in a very positive way throughout the whole first season. I guess it was the influence of the Australian Children's Television Foundation (ACTF) that resulted in making Mr. McClusky a respectable person and not as wacky as the other grownups.

The season 2 box set is available too:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortified-Episodes-14-26-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-4-Import-Australia/dp/B0013H86L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortified - Episodes 14-26 [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 4 Import - Australia </a>] I can't wait for the postman to ring at my door with a parcel from Australia!",1249257600,4,2597,5.183770883054892
