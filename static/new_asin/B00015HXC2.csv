Film moves along briskly and doesn't take itself seriously- its all for entertainment. You won't be disappointed if you approach it from that viewpoint.",1442016000,4,276,5.021739130434782
8006722,4,B00015HXC2,"Well, it isn't Citizen Kane, but it is a fun B picture. Don't expect anything original here, but if you want a fun, relaxing evening without many demands on your gray matter, this is a great film to watch. The girls are cute the guys are strong and manly, and the chemistry is there. This is a film about basic emotions and urges. Strong, handsome guy meets sweet innocent, blond who happens to have been raised in the jungle. She needs help. He responds with manly vigor. She responds with feminine charm. Attraction is mutual, he wins the day and the girl. It is all an old, old story but one we seem to enjoy, because it forms the basis of most films.

The plot is very improbable, but what makes the film enjoyable is that the chemestry is strong between the stars. You like the characters and you know what is going to happen but you want it to happen, so even though there is no supprise there is pleasue in seeing it all come out the way you wanted it to. Plus, there are just enough thrills to keep you interested and wondering if it will come out the way you hope. Taken for what it is, this film is very good. So get out the chips or whatever else it is that you like to munch, get comfy on the couch and enjoy.",1107561600,32,1221,4.173728813559322
