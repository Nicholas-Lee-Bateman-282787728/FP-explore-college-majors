8525386,5,B0085A9KE4,"Very interesting and sad documentary, about the lack of humanity shown by the Police in Vienna, the world capital of bureaucratic officialdom. I was born there and it's over 50 years since I left that homophobic hellhole and it looks like nothing has changed. Now they have ""Gay Vienna Festivals"" because they realised there is a buck in it, but in reality nothing has changed.",1454112000,,377,4.815384615384615

8525388,3,B0085A9KE4,"GONE is a sad and ultimately frustrating movie about a woman's struggle to learn what happened to her son Aeryn. Aeryn worked for the UN in Vienna, Austria. He was also gay. One night, he went missing. From the start of her search, Aeryn's mother - a police woman for over 30 years, but now retired - realizes that the Viennese police have been lying to her, manufacturing or manipulating evidence, denying access to witnesses and doing everything and anything to put roadblocks in her way. They humiliate her as the mother of a gay son, as a police woman, as an incompetent, as crazy. The movie is essentially one long studio interview with Aeryn's mother, interspersed with photos of Aeryn, hand-held shots of airports, Vienna streets, the canal where Aeryn's body was said to have been seen, of monuments, government buildings, etc., with her voice-overs. It is really almost a non-film. There are no actual interviews, only the mother's account of interviews. None of Aeryn's friends, none of the police, none of his co-workers. We assume that Aeryn was murdered and we sense that the police hate and revile gays today, just as they did during the Third Reich. Stonewall has yet to happen in Vienna, which apparently is why nobody will talk. They're too scared. But ultimately, nothing is learned and the film goes nowhere.",1438128000,,1327,4.850220264317181
8525389,3,B0085A9KE4,"A retired police officer, Kathy Gilleran, had plans to sell her home in Cortland NY, and move to Vienna (Austria) to join her gay son, Aeryn, who had relocated there a few years earlier, had a good job, and loved the area and the people.  About a month before she was to visit him there and discuss details, she received a call from the U.N. with the devastating news that Aeryn was missing, and police believed he had committed suicide, though no body was found.

Kathy flies to Vienna, and finds that the police there work a lot differently than they do in the States.  The details of their investigation prove to be fabricated, and there is an overwhelming feeling that there is some kind of cover-up involved.  From the homophobic comments made to her by investigators, it seems likely that a lot of it has to do with the fact that Aeryn was a very visible American gay man (had actually won the ""Mr. Gay Austria"" competition) in their country.  Kathy pushed the investigators every way that she could, enlisting the help of locals who knew him, the proprietor of a sauna he frequented, a gay police liaison, and even Austria's Parliament. She even walked the length of a canal that snaked through downtown, where the police had assumed he jumped to his death, even though there was no search made of the murky waters.

Obviously, this is a very emotional and disturbing documentary, though I feel it was a wee bit overdone with the extreme detail given on facts that have nothing to do with the disappearance, including videos of lots of Vienna tourist attractions that he reportedly liked.  A worthwhile warning to those planning to tour foreign countries, that things are not always as safe as they might seem on the surface.  Not rated (would be PG). I give it three stars out of five.",1349654400,,1793,4.616352201257862
8525390,5,B0085A9KE4,"Indeed, who can you trust in this world today?  Police? Politicians?  Government? Media?  This fascinating documentary is a MUST SEE for everyone - straight and gay alike.  Read the synopsis above for details, but once you have seen it you'll remember it for a long time.  It's a timely warning that not everything is as it seems, especially if tragedy strikes a gay son like Aeryn Gillern, an American young gay man living and working Vienna. Anamorphic widescreen/good transfer.",1343952000,3,480,5.025316455696203
