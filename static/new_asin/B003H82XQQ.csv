8396822,5,B003H82XQQ,I never saw any of these DVD's. I asked a question and it was misunderstood. I love the show and watch it on Dishnetwork on German Television and I am thinking of buing some DVD's. I read something about Australia in one of your comments and did not understand why. Surely these movies were not done in Australia. They were made in Vienna and Rome. My name is Sonja not Katja. Katja is the name of my German Shepherd. Please correct all that and remember this is not a review. I have not as of yet bought any of the DVD's. Thank you !,1346371200,,534,4.144230769230769
