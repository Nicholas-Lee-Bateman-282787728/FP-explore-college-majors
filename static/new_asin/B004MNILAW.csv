8436170,4,B004MNILAW,"This is an incredible performance, as there is loads of chemistry between Larry and Tak, and the band cooks too. These are truly great instrumentals played by musicians who, line-after-line, effortlessly ooze elegant melodies...they are more than top-shelf guitarists, Carlton and Matsumoto are true artists. I think that compositionally, each tune sparkles with inspiration and enthusiasm, living in a parallel universe with Carlton's best recent work on ""Fire Wire"" and ""Sapphire Blue""...I really see this collaboration with Tak Matsumoto as a high water mark for Carlton's already remarkable career. Carlton and Matsumoto should definitely continue this fertile musical partnership.

The camera work and sound is terrific throughout...the bad news is that unfortunately, the reproduction quality of this DVD is highly suspect as the disc I received from Amazon seems like a cheap copy! It does not have a menu to select individual songs. And one cannot skip from song to song either, as hitting the select button simply moves into random areas of the perfomance in the middle of tunes. I assume that this has nothing to do with Amazon, and is either a reproduction error or was a choice to cut maunufacturing costs...so you get a DVD with no menu, which is essentially like having a VHS copy (i.e., in order to find a specific song that you're looking for one has to fast forward -or-rewind  through the performance)...either way its VERY disappointing! Thankfully the music, the performance and sound/video quality is great.",1318204800,5,1528,5.258196721311475
8436171,5,B004MNILAW,"Loved The Larry Carlton/Steve Lukather DVD.

But sometimes, even with  great artists, one DVD may still be enough to get the main idea of what they have to offer/say.  Doesn't seem to be the case with Larry.

This DVD is absolutely phenomenal.  What a pairing.  Who put these guys together? Perfect. Tak is one of the best guitarist you'll ever see.  This is not Larry and an up and coming shredder.  This guy has taste, touch and class. Tak is a phenom.

Michael Rhode's bass playing is not to be missed.  Great drumming and keyboard, John Ferraro & Billy Steinway.

If you have some Larry Carlton, this is ""NOT"" more of the same.

Great, great material....and new.

Also, Larry's Saphire Blues Band DVD is not to be missed either.  Larry and a four piece horn section. New material.  Again, not more of the same.  If I had to choose though, this DVD is tops. But don't choose.

Please don't peg me as a Larry freak, I just love great concert DVDs.",1312243200,3,949,4.456140350877193
