8229992,1,B000XV6ZE6,I should have paid attention to the other reviews. This DVD is so poorly made as to be unbelievable. Christopher Lee was great as always. But there was almost nothing in the way of content to the video. The makers made big promises and delivered very little. I am just glad I bought the cheapest DVD available.,1289692800,,310,4.456140350877193
