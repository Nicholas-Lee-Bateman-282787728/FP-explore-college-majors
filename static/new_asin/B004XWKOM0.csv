8707060,1,B004XWKOM0,"Huge waste of money.  This video is under 15 minutes longs.  There is no breakdown of the choreography nor is there any explanation on how to use the implements.  You may be able to use this is if you are a hula dancer but not if you are a beginner.  Video is also very poor quality, obviously taken from a VHS tape and everything about this DVD is just dated.",1436832000,,360,4.1
