I remembered liking it, but not much else about it. It's still funny! Alec Guinness does a great job with this farce about a man descended from a long line of mariners, but who suffers from sea sickness. His attempts to uphold the family tradition lead to fun for all!",1402617600,2,400,4.346666666666667
3966162,5,B002Q0E544,"Guinness' performance in this biting satire is sensational.  It is a  ""MUST"" for any cinephile, whether you like comedy or not.",1396742400,,127,5.0
3966163,5,B002Q0E544,"This was released in the U.S. as ""All at Sea.""  Guinness portrays Captain William Horatio Ambrose, an unsuccessful Royal Navy officer who suffers from seasickness.  All of his ancestors have been mariners, and he wants to uphold the proud tradition.  He purchases the Sandcastle Pier for 5000 lbs, registers it as a ship, and is immediately at loggerheads with the town council who oppose his plans to spruce up the place, add dancing and booze, gambling, shuffleboard and bingo.  How to stop him?  They try to stick him for harbor dues for berthing the ship, so he essentially detaches a portion of the pier.  Don't wish to spoil the fun, but this is an absolute delight, with a wonderfully bubbly script by T. E. B. Clark (he also wrote ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" and the ""Lavender Hill Mob"") and first-rate direction and performances.  All hands are truly on deck for this one -- a classic.",1396483200,,893,4.72258064516129
3966164,4,B002Q0E544,"I first saw this on TV over 35 years Ago. I always wanted to see it again but didn't remember the title only the actor. Earlier searches of the internet for Alec Guinness films failed to turn it up. I found it with ""Admiral gets seasick""  on a Goggle search. Though a minor Alec Guinness film I always enjoyed it. No spoilers here. If you like British comedy buy this overlooked gem.

3966165,5,B002Q0E544,"Witty, delightful!  Why is this never shown on TV?  If you look sharp, you can see Joan Hickson (Miss Marple) among the ship's passengers.",1377216000,,138,4.708333333333333
3966166,5,B002Q0E544,"I first saw this delightful film when it was on VHS under the title of ""All At Sea.""  For those who love English comedy, this is a must purchase.  Guinness is at his best, and the script is hilarious.  One need say no more.",1362268800,,223,4.0227272727272725
3966167,5,B002Q0E544,"I have a VHS copy of this film, taped from a Public Television broadcast many years ago. I would kill for a US-format DVD.

I can't understand why this film is not available. Alec Guiness in a Ealing comedy?

For those who have not seen it, it's about a British naval officer -- the scion of a famous line of British admirals -- who has to quit the service due to chronic seasickness. The officer -- Guiness, of course -- winds up commanding an amusement pier on the Channel Coast. When he runs into trouble from the town busibodies, he takes some drastic action (no spoilers, but a quite brilliant solution to his problem). Very much in the mode of Passport to Pimlico in that the comedy comes from the unconventional efforts of some wacky characters to escape the postwar British austerity.

Great performance by Guiness -- it should not be lost.

BRW: My copy of this film is titled ""All at Sea"". I'll take a DVD copy under either title.",1353628800,5,940,4.47953216374269
3966168,5,B002Q0E544,"I have never seen the film, ""Barnacle Bill,"" except for a short clip many years ago. And, yet, from that little clip, I could tell it must be an excellent movie. After all, the star is Alec Guinness, and it is an Ealing Studios production. The Golden Gong almost never lets one down. I would love to see this fine film, I have heard so much about, and hope someone will finally put it out in U.S.A Format. I'm sure it will do well in the American market, and it will be saving a classic film for future generations. Please do something good and bring this film to the American market.",1345248000,3,584,4.27027027027027
3966169,5,B002Q0E544,"A great Alec Guinness movie that isn't well known.,  Guinness plays a British naval officer named Barnacle Bill,  who gets sea sick, so he retires from the navy and buys an old pier with ready made entertainment possibilities.  The town council wants the pier torn down for developments that will enrich the council members, and much of the story involves the creative and humorous ways that Bill and his allies thwart the council's plans.  I recommend this movie to all Guinness fans.",1464134400,,485,4.878048780487805
3966170,5,B002Q0E544,"Remember this one when I was a kid. Alec Guiness movies are all very good. Lavender hill gang, the Lady Killers, The Man in the White Suit.",1446854400,,139,4.185185185185185

3966172,2,B002Q0E544,"Of course, the great Sir Alec Guinness has several masterpiece performances to his credit.  My favorite is, ""The Horse's Mouth,"" but there are many others.  Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.  It's just plain silly.  Go ahead and watch it if you want to honor his memory but I think you'll be disappointed.",1433289600,,310,4.7924528301886795

3966174,4,B002Q0E544,"Pretty good early Alec Guinness film. Although he names his 'ship' Arabella after a lady he's just met. No build-up to the love interest angle, it was just 'instant'.
If I had to guess, I think the pier is in Clevedon in North Somerset, UK.",1427500800,,240,4.355555555555555
3966175,4,B002Q0E544,"Very cute, lighthearted comedy.  Alec Guinness is great, as always.  Very much a product of the time in which it was made, with beatniks, dancing, music, etc.  Not one I'd want to own, but it was fun nevertheless.",1427155200,,213,4.552631578947368

8377411,5,B002Q0E544,"What a great find. Alec Guiness delivers yet another quirky character. A retired naval officer suffering from sea sickness purchases a pier to run For profit. He runs it like it is a ship and soon has the entire town and beyond clamoring to take a ""cruise"" I bought this film having searched for it for a while. It was as good as I remembered. A classic",1478995200,,353,4.2835820895522385
8377412,4,B002Q0E544,"A goofy Alec Guinness movie about a seasick sailor who buys an amusement park pier and refashions it into a non-moving cruise ship for fellow mal de mer sufferers. There're subplots about a venal local council, a resentful former employer and all sorts of hi-jinks and complications. It's droll, slight, entertaining comedy, kept from sliding into complete fatuousness by the deft hand of that old pro Guinness. If you need a quick pick-me-up, this may be for you.",1472860800,,464,4.961538461538462
