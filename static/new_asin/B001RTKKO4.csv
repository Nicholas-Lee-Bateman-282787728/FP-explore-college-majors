3780511,5,B001RTKKO4,"For those of a certain age, the unexpected DVD release of this fine series in America will be a joy. It's family entertainment in the best sense of the phrase: suitable for all ages, but not overly saccharine or dumbed down in the least. The English landscape is lush & beautiful; the period flavor is just right, transporting the viewer into another time, when an adventure was always waiting just over the next hill.

The setup is classic: a widowed doctor, compassionate & strong; his warm but no-nonsense housekeeper; and his two children, full of life & curiosity. And of course, Black Beauty, the magnificent horse that becomes a beloved member of the family as well, especially for young Vicky Gordon.

Here we get to one of the show's most appealing aspects: the stunning Judi Bowker, who provided a lovely, spirited role model for girls, and was deeply & hopelessly adored by any shy, sensitive boy who watched each week. She was the daughter every parent wanted, and the girl every child wanted to befriend -- or become. She made Vicky Gorden plucky, thoughtful, and genuinely good & decent without ever being bland.

While the picture quality can be a little dark in places, that's a minor quibble. The important thing is that this wonderful series is available at last. And while longtime fans will enjoy seeing it all over again, their children & grandchildren could easily discover a new viewing treasure themselves -- highly recommended!",1242950400,9,1452,4.894308943089431
3780512,5,B001RTKKO4,"i've been trying to find a reasonably priced copy of this dvd for ages,  was getting ready to purchase a multi region dvd player, just so i could watch a pal format version from europe!  now i won't have to.  i used to watch this series years ago on a very fuzzy reception canadian channel.  [i live in michigan]  how awesome to be able to watch the whole first season, uncut in clear pefect color!  i loved judi bowker,  she was totally my idol.  what an icon to look up to as a teenage girl!  she was SO classy.",1235174400,2,513,4.101010101010101

This is the original that starred Hammer star Willian Lucas,Peter Seller ex' girlfriend Charlotte Mitchell,future Clash Of The Titans star Judi Bowker,and Roderick Shaw!!!

Many of these episodes are directed by none other than Charles Crichton,director of the classic films The Lavender Hill Mob and A Fish Called Wanda!!! Revised 5/03/09 The PQ and audio on this DVD is little rough,but so is the source material,this was most likely shot on 8 or 16 MM,The running order is different from the vastly superior Network 4-DVD Collection(which also has much better PQ and sound also,I have both seasons) which is available as only a PAL import which can be played only on certain machines! But waht really upsets me is that some episodes are edited,the pilot ""The Fugitive"" has scene with Mrs. Allingham totally cut out here(the scene where she tells Vicky and Kevin that her husband has died is completely AWOL),IT is on the Network DVD I'll update the review with any other edits as I watch the rest of the set!!!,I'm pretty dissapointed with this set overall,I mean the price is pretty good but if you have a PAL comaptible player get the Network sets,there complete,Image usually make quality products,not the case here,a real shame(the transfers are pretty bad too)!!! ,SEASON 2 IS IN THE WORKS(according to the inner artwork) AS IS SEASONS 1 and 2 of THE NEW ADVENTURES OF BLACK BEAUTY(The set from Questar is now out of print!) The five stars is for the classic series,not this set!!! The could have made this incredible,in my opinion it's just so-so,theres a chance that Image used what masters were available,but the missing scenes etc,there's no excuse for that,they were more complete when I watched them on Nickelodeon ions ago(in broadcast order as well!),glad I kept my Network sets!!! Yes todays youngters watching would not care about PQ and mising stuff,but us people who grew up with this stellar show expect more!!!",1235088000,9,2642,5.430656934306569

8338872,5,B001RTKKO4,"I love Judi Bowker and this dated little gem is well-worth the purchase.  Now that it is Autumn, soon to be winter, this is the perfect series (season 1) to watch while drinking tea and sitting by the fire all bundled up with blankets.  I really enjoyed season 1, though did not care for season 2 as much (Judi was not in it at all!)",1386547200,,333,4.107692307692307
8338873,4,B001RTKKO4,"This is a nice to watch series.  I recommend it for young age viewers.  The picture is a little grain-y but adds to the time period of the story.  There are some sad parts, but problems are solved in kindly ways.",1385164800,,212,4.121951219512195
8338874,5,B001RTKKO4,"My daughter was not even a thought in the universe when I watched this series on TV as a teen. So I was not quite sure how it would go over with her. She took to it like a duck to water, she loves horses and now she also loves this series.",1384560000,,239,3.6153846153846154
8338875,5,B001RTKKO4,"In 1974, I was in the fourth grade and hopelessly horse-crazy.  ""Black Beauty"" came on just before ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" on Sunday nights, at least for a brief time.  I only got to see a few episodes and then it disappeared from the TV listings in the Green Sheets, which were the TV program listings in the Charlotte Observer.  I was bitterly disappointed when ""Black Beauty"" was removed from the lineup.

All these years I've thought about this show and wanted to get my hands on it.  Recently, I thought to look again on Amazon and here it is!  All I'd remembered was the episode about the Viking helmet and the haunting theme music and how the few episodes I saw made me feel.  Thanks to Amazon, I got a do-over of some special and formative viewing memories!  ""The Adventures of Black Beauty"" seems quaint; much like 'The Waltons' does now:  simple and dated, yet earnest and wholesome.  TV shows like this were plentiful in the 1960's and 70's; at least on the four channels that existed back then.

Other people have complained that the video quality on these discs is poor.  I watched them on my computer and I honestly didn't mind.  I'm just glad to have them, after all these years.  I suspect that people are so accustomed to high definition that everything else seems dull.

Thank you, Amazon, for offering obscure titles such as this!  I'm thoroughly enjoying this time capsule from my past, along with the trip down memory lane that each episode offers!",1380931200,,1477,4.623076923076923

8338877,1,B001RTKKO4,"I've owned the UK version from Network DVD and I now own this Image release. The UK DVD isn't great but at least it's from original film!

This disgusting release from Image is from a Video tape source off the 16mm print. The Image frame is missing information on all sides, you can even see the ""blue warping"" on the top edges of the frame! There are video tape glitches all over the place, and why they licensed the series and not the original masters, much less attempt to restore the original 35mm negative, is beyond me.

Completely disgraceful release of a wonderful series with excellent acting and would SHOULD BE beautiful cinematography.",1326499200,4,647,4.716814159292035
8338878,5,B001RTKKO4,I LOVED watching this show back when it was on Nickelodeon. I remember i couldn't wait to rush home to see this show.  One of the great classics!,1268697600,3,145,4.178571428571429
8338879,5,B001RTKKO4,"I used to watch the Black Beauty television series on PBS as a child and my family always loved it.  I was so happy when it was recently released on DVD.  This is a great series for kids and adults alike, the acting and production are of very good quality, and it is clean and portrays good moral values.  I highly recommend it for families and especially for people who love horses!",1245628800,2,383,4.291666666666667
