1843351,4,B00008G7JA,"Hi,I am from Australia my family and I sat down to watch your version of Frontier House set in 1883 and how your ancestors lived, we to have an aussie version its called ""outback house"". What I found with your version is that 21st century people will find it hard to live like our ancestors because we all have become very soft and rely on to many gadgets, thats made us lazy. The Clunes where trying to take the easy way but I was pleasantly suprised to see how Tracey wept at the end of the project which showed maturity. I was sad to see Mark and Karen split, I think the kids from both families would survive very well as they would adapt to that life style easier, but for the adults it's going to be a long road ahead to change the comforts they so enjoyed in 21st century life, but on a whole my family enjoyed seeing how other countries pioneers lived to our pioneers. Although I would love to know how all the casts are doing now, if anybody can tell me I would love to hear, signed an aussie",1142208000,7,1001,4.164948453608248
1843352,5,B00008G7JA,"This series is incredible! It has enlightened me so much on how difficult and wonderful it must have been for some of my own early family.  To witness the metamorphosis of those participating was difficult to watch at times, but fascinating as they grew through their pain, their pre-conceptions, their modern hang-ups and grew to be more than they thought they could be.

The family bonding in some, reality of marriages without the busyness of our modern world, kept challenging me to wonder how I would handle all of it, how would my family have grown or fallen apart?  I challenged myself throughout the film and in my mind became a part of that era.  The authenticity of the clothing, household tools, all of it was such a wonderful journey to watch.

I recommend everyone to watch this film, it will challenge the

""real stuff"" that lies within each of us.  Children also must see

what it was like, w/o busy stuff of our current world, these kids

became very content with so little, worked harder than most adults of this day, but showed such a pride in their accomplishments.  It will touch your hearts, and what an awesome and easy way to step into another time, the world that was our ancestors.  I saw my own family in so many of these people, and felt good in knowing we could have won the first place, that is the stuff of our own family.  This is a gem of a movie series.

1843356,5,B00008G7JA,"I have seen the series but I must confess, I do not yet own the DVD. Even without whatever extras might be featured on DVD this is a very worthy view. They take 5 families, some with kids, and they all must live by the rules of a different era for nearly a year, in an isolated area of Montana. So for a year, all these families, these people from the 21st century, must live like pioneers. They build cabins, dig outhouses, chop wood, plant and tend gardens, raise and harvest animals & try not to starve to death. They can only go for supplies as time and money allows; these trips take a day each way and they shop at a recreated general store, only allowed to buy things possible to obtain in the 1800's. They follow them around with cameras, documenting their lives and struggles. Except for the cameras, everything else is pretty much authentically from the pioneer era. Also, perhaps best of all, in addition to the documenting cameras, each person involved is filmed in more private, confessional-type settings, and they often say whatever they want; personal opinions, feelings about other pioneer community members, all kinds of interesting things.
 The reasons I like this: It seems to unfold in a very real and natural way, never seems contrived. You get to see first hand, get a first-hand feeling of being there without becoming soiled personally, in a more detailed, more personal way than ever before, how it must have been for our brave pioneering forefathers. It gives you a better understanding and a bigger appreciation for aforementioned forefathers. You get deeply inside these people's lives for a year, feel almost acquainted with them. Like with any show or movie with many characters, you choose favorites, discover one or two with whom you can relate, yet by the end you like even those you at first were not fond of, at least a little. These families struggle and grow as we watch, some growth is in ways that we might imagine and that we could all likely benefit from, other growth is in ways none of us could really imagine, ways none of us in this century are prepared to deal with; all grow stronger in sense of individual strength and discipline, family connectivity, and community values.  You get to see these people transformed as you watch in the course of their year, and in some ways you are transformed right along with them. As they live for a year in the past, we watch as they struggle, squabble and form strong bonds with themselves and with one another. By the time they leave, even the worst enemies among them hug tearfully goodbye, and we are right there with them.
 In the end a panel of experts on the era come in and evaluate each family, rate their chances of survival if they really had been living in that time and had to live through the coming winter based on how they had done so far and how much they had prepared. These are the same experts who were consulted right along, and who set everything up authentically. Their final findings are surprising, and eye-opening.
All in all an excellent view, which offers a little bit of everything. You get drama, comedy, suspense, some action. You get the struggles man faces when living in the wilderness, living as in an era gone by, trying to make it on his own, and all while trying to coexist in a small community not of his choosing or particular liking.
Good stuff.",1075939200,24,3372,4.607321131447588
1843357,5,B00008G7JA,"Rarely have I heard so much whining in a PBS series.  My god, the Clunes --- everyone I knew who watched this had pretty much the same thing to say about them.  Rich, privileged and delusional, the Clunes drove us all crazy with their whining and self-serving rationalizations.  They were like a car accident --- they sickened you, but you couldn't help but watch them.

Watching the Glenns on the other hand was pure agony, as you witnessed the disintegration of a marriage that appeared to be cracking up even before the Frontier House experiment.  Although they proved to be quite equal to the task (the Clunes, by contrast, would have had to resort to cannibalism to survive the winter), the Glenns might have ended up killing each other somewhere along the way.  I suspect that the Glenns, unfortunately, depicted all too accurately many a domestic situation on the historical frontier.

If you have photographs of your 19th-century ancestors, particularly those who were sod-busters, take a good look at those faces.  They are the faces of weathered, hardened people who have looked adversity in the face.  Watching this series will make you understand why they looked so hardened.  Of course, the Clunes never would have gotten a chance to get their portraits made, because they would be dead.",1074729600,50,1300,4.922018348623853

1843374,5,B00008G7JA,"I watched this during it's original run on PBS and it is still my favorite reality television show. One of the best parts is that it's clear all involved wanted to get as close as possible to an 1880s frontiersperson's life. Initially. But pretty quickly it became pedantic and feud-driven and family melodramatic. This is probably very similar to what it was like for many Americans who tried and failed to settle across the West. Smartly, the show does its best not to shy away from or wallow in all the personal travails. (I'm sure it was far more tense and petty in person.) The participants were very thoughtful and reflective in their video diaries and in their interviews, and it's evident they all learned a great deal about each other and themselves. They were out there for a very long time by reality t.v. standards, so it's not surprising.

Most importantly, Frontier House benefits from perfect timing. Filmed over the Summer of 2001, it beats the influx of reality programming that changed not just television but people. Some of the participants are vain and delusional, sure, but all of them behaved that way earnestly. Filmed a few years later, and the same people might have been overly self-conscious of how they'd be characterized/branded. (See: Texas Ranch House, and even Colonial House.) The public television association likely helped relax them in front of cameras as well.

I'm sure there was enough footage for the producers to craft a more instructional type of series that centered more on the logistics of daily life and farming and all of that. Instead they gave us compelling human stories. Nate Brooks for Congress.",1485302400,7,1648,4.903225806451613

the historical accuracy is absolutely staggering, and you could tell it wasn't smoke and mirrors and that the families and the people that were involved in this project were enduring a hard time and actually struggling to adapt initially. i think the most surprising thing about this show was how comfortable the people involved had become, and when the experiment was over it was amazing that when they provided feedback on the experience how much they missed pioneer life.

i would recommend this TV series to a kid wanting further information for a history assignment, or even an adult just wishing to expand their knowledge on American history. i think it was terrific, and i'm even contemplating buying another series :)",1447200000,,1046,4.9714285714285715

However, through reruns on PBS and GAC (Great American Country) channel which I taped off TV, I was eventually able to see this series in its entirety.

""Frontier House"" follows three families consisting of the wealthy Clune family from Malibu, California, and the middle-class Glenn family from Tennessee & Brooks family from Massachusetts as they spend five months on the ""Montana frontier"" during the spring, summer and fall (autumn) of 2001.

The Clune family consisted of Gordon (age 40), the owner of an aerospace and defense manufacturing firm, his wife, Adrienne (age 39), their daughter, Aine (age 14), son, Justin (age 12), son Conor (age 8) and Gordon's niece, Tracy (age 15). The Glenn family consisted of Mark (age 45), the chair of the department of medical and pharmacy technology at Draughons Junior College in Nashville, Tennessee, his wife Karen (age 36), a school nurse, and her two children from a previous marriage/relationship, daughter Erinn Patton (age 12), and son Logan Patton (age 8). Finally, the Brooks family consisted of Nate Brooks (age 27), a student activities coordinator, his fiance, Kristen McLeod (age 27) a social worker, and for the first 3 episodes of the series, Nate's father Rudy (age 68). Rudy was not originally intended to be part of the series. He was brought in on the show only at the last moment, leaving his wife behind in Massachusetts. Kristen joined Nate and Rudy in the third episode of the show, at which point Nate and Kristen were married and Rudy left the series & returned home.

The participants spent two weeks in classrooms and kitchens, learning about the history of the period and gaining expertise in animal husbandry, carpentry, chopping wood, clothes washing, cooking, farming, gardening, harvesting skills, personal hygiene (without the use of toilet paper), sewing, soap making, and other skills which the average person in 1880s Montana would have known. The participants spent their days learning skills in Virginia City, Montana--a restored ghost town, open air museum, and National Historic Landmark, and agreed to abide by a set of rules, which included the following:

** Wearing period-appropriate clothing.
** Preparing and eating period-appropriate food.
** Using period-appropriate equipment, and using it in period-appropriate ways.
** Communicating with the outside world (including series consultants) only through the postal service at the remote country store, or via telegraph.
** Buying initial goods and supplies based on a period-appropriate budget set by series consultants, and then using the barter system during occasional visits to the country store.
** Using only period-appropriate medicines. (For a serious medical emergency, participants could talk to a member of the production staff and seek the assistance of the show's physician.)

BEFORE I saw ""Frontier House"", I really thought I would LOVE it, and was all prepared to give it 5 stars and a glowing review. Because as I'm not only a history buff with an especially deep interest in the pioneer/frontier (as well as the Holocaust) era but ALSO I'm an extremely strong supporter of the ""back-to-the-land"" movement, and very interested in homesteading, organic & eco-friendly ""green"" living, small-scale farming, alternative energy and living ""off-the-grid"" and as close to the land and nature as possible, I  the premise of this PBS ""reality TV"" series in which modern, 21st century families, move to homesteads in Montana to live under 19th century rules & standards (as if it really was the 1880s instead of 2001) and see how they'd fare (and, in particular, if they'd amassed enough food for themselves & their livestock, and enough firewood/fuel for heat, to last & survive through the winter) if they'd been pioneers living & homesteading ""on the frontier"".

However, though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontier-House/dp/B00008G7JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontier House</a>&nbsp;is definitely a THOUSAND TIMES better than the other ""reality show"" crap on TV over the past decade or two or so, unfortunately, for the most part, this show was still a HUGE letdown! :(

First and foremost, while this PBS ""reality TV"" series claims to be true to history, in all honesty, it is SELECTIVE history! While everyone gripes about the Clune family's ""bending of the rules"" from what I've seen, NOBODY bothers to criticize how the show only follows (or NOT follows!) the rules/customs/standards of the 1880s only AS & WHEN IT SUITS THEM!!!!!!!

For example, they are so busy obsessing over how to prevent the teenage Clune girls from using forbidden makeup or modern personal care products or Mrs Clune from bartering/trading with neighbors for extra provisions (which in fact has been quite common throughout history -- including & especially in the 19th century. Its only been in the past 50-100 years, since industrialization & corporatization, that bartering/trading became less common, though recently it has been making a comeback with Craigslist, online bartering websites and local barter networks) by claiming that it ""brings the modern conveniences of the 21st century into the 1880s"" -- and meanwhile, in such blatant hypocrisy, they have no problem bringing the modern world into the 19th century by so cowardly abdicating the participants freedom & liberty and meekly following the fascist, corporate-backed, profit-driven ""nanny state"" 21st century laws prohibiting or restricting hunting & fishing (which people were FREELY able to do in the 1880s) instead of  just filming the series in an area, and/or time of the year when hunting & fishing are allowed, or even challenging the Constitutionality of laws banning or limiting hunting & fishing. Because the fact is,  that in the era BEFORE supermarkets (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walmart/dp/1932857249/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walmart</a>), BEFORE pizza delivery, and BEFORE drive-through fast-food joints, frozen TV dinners, pre-packaged ramen noodles & other ""food"", when the majority of people were living ON the land and feeding (and even clothing) themselves from the fruits of their land & their labor, people used to HUNT & FISH for their food. That is a simple fact dating back to the hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic times. They did not drive to the nearest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walmart/dp/0385513577/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walmart</a>&nbsp;to pick up a couple pounds of ground chuck wrapped in plastic on a styrofoam tray, derived from one of THOUSANDS of sick & diseased grain-fed (cows should be ONLY pasture-raised & grass-fed) cows in a filthy Big Ag ""factory farm"" hundreds or thousands of miles away. No, they took a fishing rod or a stick, or a fishing spear & net and went caught their meal or they took a bow & arrow, or their shotgun or rifle, and went hunting for bear, or buffalo, or elk, or deer, or rabbits or wild turkeys or whatever!

Yet the producers of ""Frontier House"" conveniently omit this aspect of history, by claiming that the modern laws prohibit hunting, when they very well could have just chosen to film in a location and/or time of the year when hunting IS allowed. Not only do they use the fascist ""nanny-state"" 21st century laws as an excuse, but I also read that the producers refused to allow the participants to hunt on the show because they were worried about the safety issues of giving the participants access to weapons -- which is another ridiculous & laughable excuse considering that in the 1880s, especially living on the frontier, PEOPLE HAD WEAPONS!

They had weapons to hunt for food, and they had weapons for self-defense and defense of their home/property and family from wild animals or occasionally unwanted human intruders (its not exactly like they could call 911 in those days, and have armed police there within seconds or even minutes!) and people were taught from a very young age about proper respect for weapons. Often they made even made their own ammunition from hand (like in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-House-in-the-Big-Woods/dp/0060581808/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little House in the Big Woods</a>&nbsp;book in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-House-on-the-Prairie/dp/0060754281/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little House on the Prairie</a>&nbsp;series by Laura Ingalls Wilder) and learned almost from the cradle, that guns and other weapons are not a toy, but a tool for survival, especially on the frontier.

If the creators of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontier-House/dp/B00008G7JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontier House</a>&nbsp;were really true to history, they would teach the participants about the historical period-appropriate weapons & weapon safety -- the SAME WAY that they gave them classes in animal husbandry, and farming, and sewing and making soap, and candles, and other skills/tasks common & often necessary for survival in the 19th century................AND THEN give them period-appropriate hunting weapons (meaning no modern automatic assault weapons, or the like!) and allow them to hunt like they would have been free to do in the 1880s!

Unfortunately, the ban on hunting was far from the only inaccuracy in this series. For example, in one episode, Tracy Clune, the 15 year old niece of Gordon & Adrienne Clune, was experiencing intense homesickness, so the producers brought Tracy's parents for a visit -- and in another episode, the producers bring Karen Glenn's mother to visit for Logan's 9th birthday celebration. NONE of that would have ever happened, or, at the least, it would've been very unlikely, had it actually happened in the 1880s! In those days, traveling by covered wagon to frontier homesteads took days or weeks, if not MONTHS! So pioneer families who moved West, rarely (if ever!) saw their relatives again after they left, or at least, not for years at a time. The only communication homesteaders had with those living elsewhere was postal mail which took weeks or months to arrive. Meaning that if it were really 1880s Montana, and Tracy was feeling homesick or Logan wanted Grandma to visit for his birthday, their only option would be to write a letter -- and if they wrote it in the spring, then, the earliest the recipients would get it would be sometime in summer or fall, and even if they (Tracy's parents & Logan's grandmother) replied right away, Tracy & Logan still wouldn't get those response letters until the next spring. Or even if Tracy's parents & Logan's grandmother immediately decided to visit Tracy & Logan (which itself would be highly improbable!) since they would not be able to travel by covered wagon during winter, by the time they got Tracy & Logan's letters, it would be too late in the year for them to leave, and they'd have to wait until early the next spring (like April) and they wouldn't reach the homesteads until the following fall!

So if these producers of the show were really ""true to history"", they would let the modern 21st century families FULLY EXPERIENCE the feelings of homesickness for the 5 months of filming, especially since the real homesteaders had no choice but to just endure it -- and for YEARS at a time, with NO ""quick fixes"" (such as allowing Tracy's parents and Logan's grandmother to come for a visit). In 1880s Montana, if homesteaders were homesick and missing their Mom & Dad or their Grandma, there'd be NOTHING they could do about it, other than suffer while still going on with their lives & their chores, responsibilities and activities of day-to-day living-- as in those days, putting Mom & Dad or Grandma on a Boeing 747 jet airplane & flying them in for a couple days visit, wasn't yet even considered to be in the realm of possibility! In those days it took weeks, even months to travel across the country by covered wagon, and even traveling by train (which was often too expensive for the average person) took days at a time, so people couldn't just drop by for a quick trip -- if they ever even came to visit, they'd stay for months, or at the least, they'd usually arrive in summer or fall and stay through the winter and then leave the following spring when it was possible to travel again. So the quick visits by Tracy's parents and Logan's grandmother is yet another hypocritical (along with the ban on hunting) and blatant departure from historical accuracy & reality on ""Frontier House""!

Also, with a few exceptions (the Brooks family, the Clune children, and occasionally, the Glenn/Patton children, Erinn & Logan Patton) the rest of the characters were usually unbearably annoying!

I suppose the producers thought that the competition & animosity between the characters, especially the rivalry between Gordon Clune & Karen Glenn, and the marital discord between Mark & Karen Glenn (who eventually divorced very soon after the show -- as ultimately, also did Gordon & Adrienne Clune who divorced several years later) would be enjoyable to 21st century viewers who've gone completely brain-dead from constantly (even daily) being fed vapid ""reality TV"" media like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survivor/dp/B0001ZDKXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survivor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fear-Factor/dp/B000FDE5TY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fear Factor</a>. However, quite frankly, I thought the tension between the characters was not only an irritating turn-off, but not entirely true to history either. I mean, yes, of course there were conflicts & tensions between pioneers living on the frontier in the 1880s, but UNLIKE in this series, where the three families are no more than a 15 minute walk away from each other's homesteads, in those days, the pioneers often lived so far apart, that it would take HOURS to walk to the nearest neighbor.

So if it were really the 1880s, the homesteaders would be too busy tending their fields, caring for their livestock, and cooking & cleaning to care (or even notice) what kind of mattress (sometime during the series, Gordon & Adrienne Clune snuck in a prohibited modern box-spring mattress) their neighbor was sleeping on, or whether forbidden makeup & personal care cosmetics were being used. They just did NOT have the time or opportunity to get in those kinds of quarrels -- and even when/if they DID get the chance to meet their ""neighbors"", they probably wouldn't have cared or even noticed if their neighbor was sleeping on a mattress of pure solid gold, because they were just so thankful for the companionship and a break from the loneliness and homesickness, living all alone on the frontier, separated from their relatives, and often even miles & miles from the nearest neighbor. Even the TV series ""Little House on the Prairie"" despite its many changes & dramatized storylines for television audiences (like the fact that UNLIKE in the TV series, in real-life, Mary Ingalls never got married or ran a blind school and the characters of Albert, Cassandra & James Ingalls never existed) was MORE realistic than ""Frontier House""! At least ""Little House on the Prairie"" showed Charles Ingalls (and other characters) going hunting for food from time to time!

On the other hand, there were *some* entertaining scenes in ""Frontier House"". I really enjoyed seeing the kids (especially the Clune girls) and hearing their insightful thoughts about living as 19th century kids in a 21st century world.

In other words, if you are looking for a semi-entertaining but factually erroneous, pseudo-educational ""reality TV"" show from PBS, then ""Frontier House"" is a better choice than ""Survivor"" or ""Fear Factor"". However, if you are looking for a truly educational show about the pioneer era, that is historically accurate, you'd be better off looking elsewhere, preferably in books about this period and staying AWAY from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontier-House/dp/B00008G7JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontier House</a>!!!!",1400889600,5,16639,5.514700117600941

If you are going to watch with kids, my one warning  is that the adults on the show talk at length on several occassions about their sex lives (or lack thereof) on the frontier.  By no means do I think the creators should have omitted this.  However, just be prepared if you're going to watch with young people.  Either have ""the talk"" beforehand or hit fast-forward when an adult is interviewed on the subject, because it'll be more than a passing remark.

Overall, the show provided us with highly engaging historical information as well as many vivid illustrations of basic human psychology.  To me, that far outweighed the times I sat uncomfortably beside my child while the adults talked about using pig intestines as condoms or how they weren't having sex.

1843469,4,B00008G7JA,"Everyone has already described this show well - my comment is only re: the people.

First, I feel sorry for Karen Glenn and all the terrible things people are saying about her.  She is gossipy and judgmental (she's southern!), but I admired how hard she worked - and, her kids are fantastic! So much better adjusted than the Clune children, so she must be doing something right.  in the show, the Clunes say they were more focused on each other than their kids in ""2001', whereas Karen talks about being so bonded with her children she misses them when they leave for school.  she is pretty insensitive to Logan's feelings about the animals, though, and I felt very sorry that his mother couldn't acknowledge his feelings. (logan was such a cute, sensitive and yet capable kid- i hope she hasn't squelched that as he has grown.) She did not relate well to her husband, but he seemed liked an idiot and would have driven me crazy.  bottom line - she's bad but not the witch everyone makes her out to be.

The Clunes were intolerable - with the exception of the older son, who somehow ended up a mellow, hard working kid amongst a group of brats that should not be unleashed in society.  The family did stick together, but the children were obviously not raised by anything resembling a good parent.  the other great thing about the Clunes was the mother cranking out fantastic baked goods that would be hard to make in a 2001 kitchen. she was phenomenal.  the husband was totally obnoxious (the still was brilliant, however.) my favorite part was how he was convinced he was deathly ill and needed to protein-load, but when the doctor visited him, he was told that he actually came into the project fat & out of shape and the only thing going on with his health, which had actually improved from his weight loss, was he wasn't drinking enough water!  the Clunes were the text book example of fat, grubby, whining, self-absorbed Americans (although not native)

so, the Glenns and the Clunes both need extensive therapy.

 everyone loves the Brooks, of course.

the bottom line is this is mostly a show about the personality dynamics of these people with some frontier stuff thrown in!  a guilty pleasure, for sure.",1324684800,6,2213,4.652956298200514
1843470,4,B00008G7JA,"This series is very interesting to watch, and the historical aspects are fascinating.
The positives are: Good image quality, good sound, good narration, interesting throughout, with no boring parts.
The negatives are: Bad character choice (mostly) for such an experiment. Considering over 5000 families applied, there should definitely be families available that would have made the experiment a better project. The only ones that I believe made real solid characters for such an experiment were Nate Brooks, and his father Rudy.

To clarify my sentiments, let us look at the families & characters:

The Clunes (Gordon, Adrienne, their sons and daughter and their niece)
A Beverly Hills millionaire family who actually came closer together as a family, and learn a lot about themselves, and their physical abilities. This is positive. The bad part is that they are not able to make the real mind-shift to being self-supporting for the period. They come to the table with the modern mind-set that money is what is needed to survive. Many of Gordon's schemes revolve around making enough money so that they could stock up on food from the general dealer, instead of producing it himself. He made some valid points on the production not being realistic, because they were not allowed to hunt, which was a major way to supplement ones pantry on the true frontier. As a family, the Clunes made it for the better, but as for the required mind-set to be self-supporting, they did not. For a millionaire's wife that was used to getting pampered, and getting things done for her, I must say that Adrienne impressed me. Though she was at times depressed in the small cabin, she knuckled down and always tried to remain positive, and do her best for her family. She was never whining or complaining about the other people, and did not make a difficult life more difficult for her husband, and did not make him feel inadequate. She was very inventive with her baking, and really put love and effort into what she made. Of the women on the series, I found her the most admirable.

The Glenn's (Mark, Karen, Karen's son and daughter)
A family that mustered the skill and mind-set to actually make survival possible, but being torn apart by a forever critical, headstrong Karen who thinks that she is the head of the house, and the centre around which everything revolves. She is opinionated, critical and outspoken about everybody, and constantly degrading and sarcastic towards her husband, Mark. This, in my opinion, is the biggest negative about this whole series. What makes it worse, is that Karen purports to be the most serious about her Christian faith, but in actuality portrays a picture of a wife who degrades and wants to control her husband - the antithesis of a Christian wife. Mark, on the other hand, being relegated to the periphery of the family, discovers a personal journey and a deep satisfaction in the life on the frontier. Had he had a supportive wife who believed in him, they could have made a real good team, and would have probably made a resounding success of the project. Karen's daughter Erin is fantastic in the series. She has adapted so well to this new life that she was thoroughly enjoying it, especially the outdoors, and the animal husbandry (the constant  parental tensions in the cabin were probably driving her out anyway) and she did not want her old lifestyle back. She is a real plus on this set. Of the children on the scene, I found her the most admirable.

The Brooke's (Nathan, and his father Rudy - later joined by his new bride Kirsten)
The relationship between Nathan and his father is truly admirable. They were faced with the biggest challenge of all the families, since he had to build a cabin from scratch. The way they set about the task, accepting difficulty as part of life, and their calm, steady characters are simply commendable. Their characters make this real. They even make time to help the other families, regardless of the fact that they have the most difficult start. Never one word of complaint, never a flare of anger or irritation, calm, stable, steady solid, hardworking. They really have the character that it would have  taken to build the frontier. Of the men on the set, I find Nate and Rudy most admirable. I guess the compliment goes to Rudy, as it is his character that he has reproduced in his son, and even in Nate's older brother who came for a visit, who displayed the same kind of character. Rudy's wife, Kirsten does not seem to fit in so well, she complains about trivial things...dirty fingernails, hair, acne, mice, constant cooking etc. I think that despite the fact that Nate really loved her, she did not turn out the positive support and moral encouragement that a man needs under these circumstances.

Conclusion:
I think this series could have been fantastic had the character selection been given more attention. Surely among 5000 families there should be some choice? Running a few psychological and psychometric tests during shortlist screening would have quickly red-flagged people such as eg. Karen Glenn as self-willed, self-centered, critical, and unsuitable for such an experiment. Conversely, it would have confirmed Nate and Rudy Brooks as ideal characters.
The bottom line is that pioneering required not just skills and knowledge that are almost lost, but required a solidness of character which is rare to find among modern mankind.",1318291200,8,5425,4.883821932681868
1843471,5,B00008G7JA,I have seen the entire series probably close to 10 times. I love this show and the cast! The production company did such a thorough and wonderful job of creating a 1840s atmosphere. It has been PBS's triumph.,1317168000,,208,4.5
1843472,4,B00008G7JA,"This film shows how 3 modern families - the Glenns, the Clunes, and the Brooks - cope with frontier life as it would've been in 1883.  Any romantic notions that frontier life will resemble Little House on the Prairie are shattered as the families are faced with backbreaking labor, monotonous chores, and kids put to work early with little playtime left over.  There's also livestock to watch over, bears to contend with, and harsh winters demanding early preparation or else you would've survive them.

From the start, the Glenns and the Clunes clash.  The Glenns are hard workers and believe in playing by the rules.  The Clunes, in contrast, continuously break rules, at first with remorse but later without.  There's one scene where Mr. Clune defends his unethical behavior and his wife looks up at him proudly.

Karen Glenn wonders aloud why the Clunes bothered participating in an authentic, historical experiment if they're just going to modernize the experience. I wondered this, too.  However, I also sensed a competitive side to Karen as well.  She later fesses up to this, which I thought demonstrated good character and self-awareness.

Instead of focusing so much on the Clunes, though, Karen probably should've focused more on her marriage, which slowly unravels during this 5 month stay. Going in, their marriage seemed shaky.  Adding a stressful pioneer life widened the cracks. It didn't help that husband Mark Glenn had unrealistic and unfair expectations of their marriage, especially concerning her kids from a previous marriage.

The bright light among all this bickering were the Brooks, especially Nate. Nate is a remarkable human being. He starts the show drawing the short end of the stick, being penniless and having to start his home from scratch....yet never complains about his misfortune.  Instead, he remains focused on the work ahead with a positive attitude throughout. I wish more people had his work ethic.

At the end, the families move back to their modern life and are interviewed one last time to compare the homestead life to modern day life. I was fascinated listening to these differences. The families also get the results telling them if they would've survived the winter or not, based on how much prep they did.

The Frontier House is a fascinating show on three levels. On one level, it's learning how life was really like on the homestead. On another level, it's watching how humans react in close quarters and what decisions they make to survive. And on another level, it's examining our modern day life and challenging our beliefs that bigger and faster are always better.",1312848000,2,2621,5.020785219399538
1843483,5,B00008G7JA,"My mother introduced me to the different PBS ""house"" shows and I've seen all of them except for Ranch House. Frontier House is my favorite by far, with Manor House a close second. I first picked up Frontier House from the public library and was so captivated by the show I watched both discs straight through! I rarely do this with ANY program. I rented it a handful of times before finally adding it to my personal DVD collection.

FH provides a (mostly) historically accurate step back in time, where three modern day families are ""transported"" to Montana in the 1800s. The series shows the hard work, skill, tools, and everyday tasks of the homesteader during that time. It candidly shows the struggles each family has while trying to adjust to their new lives.

I am such a fan of Frontier House that I bought the accompanying book of the same name, by Simon Shaw. I also contacted PBS about any ""10-yr anniversary-where are they now"" programs or sequels in the making, to which they responded neither are being considered at this time. :[

I would rate the series as ""PG"" because there are a few candid discussions about contraception and intimacy on the frontier, but overall I feel it is a great show to watch with your family. Hope this review helps!",1312243200,2,1258,4.632286995515695
1843484,5,B00008G7JA,"All in all a fascinating program, but way too short.

I would have liked to learn more about what the family members did all day and how exactly they did it. For example, in the last episode, during the evaluation, we learn that Adrienne Clune made curtains and pickled vegetables, yet we never see her do it. We are shown the home-made wire on one of the chicken coops (the Brooks'?) but we don't learn how the wire was made. Along a similar line, it would have been interesting to hear more about how they dealt with the sanitary conditions (or lack thereof). How did they brush their teeth? What did they use for dish detergent? How did the women feel about using sanitary belts?

I also would have liked to know what happened to the homesteads after the end of the experiment, especially to the animals and the supplies the families had stored.

Instead of focusing so much on the inter- and intra-family bickering, more time could have been spent explaining the evaluation of their winter preparations. It all seemed a bit rushed. - And speaking about bickering: it never became clear to me why the Glenns had such a hard time getting along (especially since they had it easiest of all the families insofar as they moved into an existing home). What exactly in Karen's behavior or role did Mark resent so much?

Something else I'm wondering about: Was Gordon Clune charged for the doctor's visit (like Karen Glenn) or did he whine and play the drama king until the producers became seriously concerned and sent a medical expert out to investigate?",1307232000,4,1552,4.653284671532846
1843485,5,B00008G7JA,"This was an excellent show on how adults should NOT influence their children! The history and the lifestyle is PBS Gold as usual, but I wonder what the family decider-type-people were thinking when they picked these three! It wasn't really reality either because they didn't have to make it through even one week - or two weeks in the winter. I know people who live in Montana, and that's the hardest part of that beautiful state - winter lasts a long time.

I agree with the reviewer who said the Homestead era was great for men, not so much for women. And I don't like admitting this at all, because I consider myself an independent and capable female. But, the females from the CA family made me embarrassed to be female. Really? You are going to live as a pioneer in the year (small clue here...) 1833!!! There's no make up! Also, who would pick a wealthy beyond measure family for this type of gig? At the end, when dad came out of his newly finished mansion overlooking the sea in Malibu - he just looked ridiculous. We just saw the type of life our ancestors lived - toughing life out and doing with what really mattered, and here comes Bob Bitchen who in reality lives in a house that just made him look like the puffed up, look-at-me, I make my own rules personality he truly is. Why did PBS allow this family to continue on when they cheated every single step of the way?? That's not right. And, teaching your kids how to make moonshine?? Really? People chide the Glenn's because of their breakdown in communication, but it's my opinion that the only reason the C. marriage is together, is because the wife is a total doormat to her husband. He is the KING and she follows him around like the newborn colt they decided to sell - because they didn't want to chop more hay for the animal's survival, and because he bought up the store because his family was ""starving"" and went into the red and had to step up and pay the bill. I can't stand liars. And cheaters - who know they're cheating - are the worst kind of liar. Pops just absolutely had to have his way. Which is why he didn't get along with Ms. Glenn. She is exactly like him.

I felt sorry for the poor Glenn children. Watching their parents fight and argue and slap each other with words in the home is bad enough, but these kids witnessed the many arguments knowing this was ON CAMERA. Hello, mom and dad??? Who's the adult here? I hate to label people and places, but when I lived in the South, I saw the same type of behavior: gossip, gossip, gossip, but go to church every Wednesday and Sunday doncha know. And what is it with 21st century women? Especially the younger 20-something women?? Some of them need to step OFF of their men already! Why do these women feel the need to ride their husbands like Zorro - never letting them just...breathe!?! It's funny, the people pickers picked a family where the guy was a chauvenist with the most whiniest kids on this earth, to the family who has Mrs. Cravettes and won't leave her husband alone. He was kind of a bent fender anyways, and the remark about ""I should never have became a stepfather."" That was beyond not cool. Forget the separation dude, just get the divorce. That attitude should never be allowed around children already suffering from one marital breakup. And Karen could do to appreciate those children of hers. Those kids were the best kids out of all the youngsters on the show. They really lived the life and didn't complain. Even when they suffered losses common to the pioneer family in farming - they still didn't complain.

The Brooks were by far the most entertaining - in a positive way. I learned so much from the way they loved each other and tried to be positive and get along. It was sad how lonely it was for them because the other two were acting like the Hatfields and the McCoys. But, I don't think it was fair to include a family that had no children with others who did. It was very much harder for the families with children - so much more work. But, it was tipping the scale a bit too much. Plus, the wife coming in two months into the project - was just too wierd. She didn't have to do much at all except cook and dishes. Her husband had already prepared the hardest work. But, it was sweet how she tried because she saw how badly he wanted the experience. And she did step up to the plate.

Nice touches - Adrienne can cook! Her menus were fabulous looking. Because this was in 2001, they heard news of the Terrorist attack at the farms. Adrienne made a flag from scratch. I was a bit jealous because they were so sheltered out in the West with no electronics. They didn't have to experience the attack as the rest of us did. The Glenn children riding their horse to school and how well they took care of the animals. Just awesome. And last, but definitely the best: Mr. Brooks gets a white dress and beautiful veil for his bride. How awesome is that guy???",1305331200,4,4917,4.394072447859495

1843487,3,B00008G7JA,"Being a huge fan of the House series, I was excited to find one that I had overlooked.  However, it just isn't the same - it seemed too much like your typical American reality show (very little substance, lots of whining).  I loved the other series because, even though the participants were miserable at times, they all seemed to at least make an effort to take it seriously.  However, the Clune family didn't even try, and that ruined it for me.  I was kind of worried when the Clune mom and 2 teenage daughters spent the entire first episode getting upset about how they weren't allowed to bring any make-up.  Seriously, I can imagine that the lack of toilet paper and soap would be pretty gross and worthy of complaint, but freaking out because you can't bring mascara or lipstick with you?  What did they think they were signing up for?

After the first episode I was still hopeful that they would come around and prove themselves to be better than the spoiled Malibu snobs that they were initially portrayed as, but no suck luck.  In other episodes the fact that they continue to cheat is alluded to, but what isn't included in the show (but is mentioned in a companion book) is that the Clunes continued to use modern toiletries, had their modern-day neighbors bring them food and mail, watched tv, used the phone, etc.  Also, throughout the show they continually break the rules of 19th century frontier society, but nobody seems to care.

I'm not saying that everyone else in this show is perfect, but they at least seemed to make a genuine effort.  I'm not sure why the Clunes were chosen.  Did the producers think that they would add drama to the show (they certainly did, but not in a good way), or did they just not realize what putzes they were until it was too late to replace them?  I would have given this 1 star, except the other participants were (mostly) great and, as with the other House series, the creators did an impressive job of trying to make the setting authentic.",1278374400,11,1993,4.549019607843137

I just wonder if Frontier Valley is still there, if it's open to the public and if you can visit the place where it ""experiment"" took place.  I think it would be fun to try it. That kind of life is not for the weak.  I just wish they would have shown more about the actual daily life and not so much of the drama from the twentith century.  The Frontier House website is also an excellent source of information for those of us who were born in the wrong century.",1270425600,2,637,4.056

I have to disagree with many of the other viewers though. While I found the Clunes tough to watch in the beginning, I really came to respect them for what they were open to and what they allowed themselves to learn.

The Glens seemed like a family that had major issues before they began. While their children were wonderful, Karen seemed very immature in her ability to relate and get along with others. Her husband seemed very closed off, but mostly just broken. Karen on the other hand seemed at times to be very angry. I feel badly for her because I don't think she realizes how she comes across.

The Brooks are as wonderful as all the other reviewers wrote. Good example of people who are kind.

1843491,5,B00008G7JA,"This is about people.  Summery - Three families - well two families and a family to be - are given two weeks training on how to live as 1883 settlers on the frontier for five months.  They have to use only items, tools, equipment from the time period and only have so much in supplies and credit at the general store.  It is amazing, wonderful, funny and, sometimes, sad.  They learned how to use the tools, they learned about cooking, animal care, keeping clean, building the houses and riding horses.  They found out that there was no toilet paper, no makeup and no tampons.
I think, at first, people kind of attach themselves to one of the families.  I found myself leaning towards the Glenn Family.  They seem spirited and strong while the Clune Family seemed spoiled and complained A LOT.  But as I got to see how the Clune Family got together, used their resources, and, even in the harsh times, showed some humor I started to lean towards them.  Of course the Glenn Family also kind of imploded.  There is a thin line between micro-management and nit-picking.  Yes there was some cheating, breaking of the rules.  Or is it trading baked goods with the natives?
The Brooks Family REALLY impressed me.  They were loving, supportive, even of the other families, seemed to take tiny, careful, steps in deciding how to expand their homestead and building up their resources.  It was a major event in their lives.  They really focused on the basics - food, their animals and their long term future.
It was also interesting to see how the kids handled the problems of life on the frontier and how they kind of bonded during their last few weeks while in school.  It was also interesting to see them two months after it was all done.  The girls in the Clune Family, for example, seemed to be uncomfortable in their string bikinis while in front of the camera.  Had their old fashion outfits, which sometimes covered them from neck to ankle, awaken in them a sense of modestly?
I don't want to say too much but the two DVDs, even without the extras in the form of special features, could be used in classes of history or even team management classes.
Many of the reviews you have seen talk about the breaking of the rules and, frankly, I think you have to decide about that on your own.  Did the settlers have rules?  At least 19th Century settlers could hunt, which gave them a good supply of food, furs and skins to trade, and maybe a sense of protection that these modern settlers did not have.  Given, for example, deer skins and salted meat every few weeks, could they have focused more on chopping wood and bring in the hay?  Maybe?
Would they have survived the winter?  If they had known they would be facing a winter would they have tried harder?  Worked together?  Eaten each other?  Maybe.",1238889600,7,2797,4.544

1843503,5,B00008G7JA,"PBS is excellent at providing quality entertainment and slipping education into the equation. With the success of 1900 House, a realty mini-series where one family was transported to the Victorian Era, executives decided to send three families to the frontier of Montana with only the supplies that families would have had in 1883. Meet The Clunes, The Brooks', and The Glenns. The Clunes are a wealthy family from California, accustomed to frequent business trips and luxury. The Brooks family begins with Nate and his father Rudy and ends with Nate and his new wife Kristen. They are a biracial family, which was not uncommon in the west at the time. The Glenns are a family of four from Tennessee with a domineering mother and and a passive stepfather.

There are six hour-long episodes on two disks which include behind the scenes and making of featurettes. Since only one third of the families that ventured to the west survived the five years it took to win their land claims, it is interesting to speculate on which family would have been best suited for the task.

The casting is great. The Clunes can be annoying because they are the most apt to cheat and then cover their tracks. However, they work hard and are a loving family. It is particularly interesting to see how the opinions of the two teenaged girls, Tracy and Aine, change over the course of the five months. The Glenns are arguementative with each other, mainly because of Karen Glenn's strong personality. She can provide interesting commentary though, which is often in direct contrast with the others'. Her children are fun to watch, although son Logan gets the most air time. The Brooks are filmed the least, possibly because they have the least amount of troubles. Nate is well adapted for the west, and his loving bride Kristen endures it to please him. They provide rational thought to the equation when the Clunes and the Glenns have their fights. The community becomes like a real family; the transition is believable because it is real.

This miniseries documents a fascinating journey that proves that reality TV can be worthwhile. One only wishes that there were more to see.",1193270400,6,2159,4.845528455284553

1843505,5,B00008G7JA,"The most important thing about this type of experiment (the House series, and this is obviously the best one) is the interactions of the family members, to find out what is the basis of a family, what are more exactly the roles we members (male, female, child, adult) have to play. It is absolutely not (even if from the producer's point of view it may be) to see how we, modern day city slickers can make it in an 1883 Montana environment. At least not for me. I don't care for that: lack of comforts, no tv, no refrigerator, no shower, no shampoo... so what? you can go on a mission trip to Per today for that.

But when it comes to surviving, physically, and there's a wife and kids involved that depend on you, what do you do Mr.? Do you decide to play the role of the old-fashioned head of the family, and risk being labeled 'machista' by the feminists (like the 2 times married lady in the episode)? Or would you compromise, or what? Of course you could do no more than what your wife permits; and that's the trick that makes it so interesting. How would you, ladies, take your role? When it comes to surviving, would you give up feminist quarrels just as you would have to give up your make up? The film shows us pretty clear that it was rougher for the females. The males loved it, pure and simple.

Another great thing about this is that we witness three very different families, by the way they interact, and the way they see  their own roles as members of the family.

The question therefore is not: would they have made it through the winter? But... Would they have made it as a family? And the answer differs. One family is much stronger, from the wife and husband to the kids. Another, since they have no kids and have just got married, plays no significant role in this experiment. And the third comes out broken. If they ever thought they were a family their view must have broken into pieces like a shattered glass. They did not know how to function as a family because they (and I leave it to the viewer to put the names) took their 21st century notions of family with them. Sad, to see at the end each one living separately after all they had to go through. And their kids did not get a positive impression from their adults either.

Moral: You'd better know well before you marry a woman with two kids. Oh, and the landscapes are gorgeous. A beautiful thing to watch.",1188172800,4,2387,4.34304932735426
1843506,5,B00008G7JA,"This series features six hour long episodes involving three 21st century families attempting to live as homesteaders in the Montana Territory of 1883. Historically speaking, the original homesteader families were required to farm the land for 5 years in order to gain ownership. But in ""Frontier House"" the families are only here for 6 months, with the major goal being to become prepared to survive the upcoming winter. In the end, the relative success or failure of each family is evaluated by a group of historical experts.

The Clunes are a wealthy family of six from California. They definitely  come across as the least likable family. Gordon is an arrogant jerk who attempts to disrupt the authenticity of the project through various forms of ""cheating"". His wife whines about not being able to wear makeup and the kids are rather spoiled. But still I do have to give the family credit for toughing it out for the entire six months instead of quitting the project altogether. The wife and two teenage girls clearly don't want to be there. But even they admit, after coming home to California, that participating in this project did help them to become better people and to have more appreciation for the luxuries of modern life.

The Glenns are a middle class family from Pleasant View, Tennessee, just 10 miles down the road from where I now live. They have more of a background in ""country living"" and are generally more successful in adapting to the frontier than are the Clunes. Karen is an extraordinarily determined woman with a strong personality. Mark seems dissatisfied in his role as step father and there is alot conflict between Karen and he. But, unlike some other reviewers, I saw Mark as a basically decent guy. He clearly loves the frontier lifestyle and works very hard to keep things going. I think he and Karen just have incompatiable personalities. The Glenn kids are terrific, doing a great job with the animals and never complaining about the modern conviences they have to do without.

Nate Brooks is a great guy and it is terrific to see he and his father bonding so intensely while working together to build a cabin for Nate's fiancee, Kristen, who is arriving from Boston. The episode that ended with the wedding of Nate and Kristen is excellent. But afterwards it becomes evident that Kristen is a ""city girl"" who is not really prepared to endure the hardships of frontier life, especially her ""woman's role"" assigned tasks of cooking and cleaning. Still Nate keeps a great attitude throughout and even tries to serve as a peacemaker between the feuding Glenns and Clunes.

Sometimes their fights are with their neighbors, their families, or even within themselves.  It is remarkable to see how the families change during their stay in the Montana wilderness.  It is interesting to see the individual families follow the rules to their own interpretations.  It is difficult to review this without containing spoilers.

1843508,4,B00008G7JA,"The PBS historical ""House"" shows are such a great concept - involving, educational, and often beautiful to look at. It's the real day-to-day history of people, something we didn't really learn in school when we were memorizing which year a certain war started or a certain leader rose to power, etc.

I would have given the show five stars if not for the producers' focus on the complaints of many of the show's participants. It seemed like the producers chose participants that they knew would complain in order to heighten the drama. It was more annoyingly overdone than dramatic though. (And conversely, the people who didn't complain, like Nate and his dad, weren't boring or anything -- they were great to watch.)

The producers' official reasoning for focusing on this aspect was that the show wasn't just about the 1880s, it's about modern day people and how they'd react to the frontier life. But if PBS really wanted to make this about the typical modern person's reaction, they could've included a family from a working class or poor background. Modern people that have to deal with things like: standing at a snowy or sweltering bus stop in order to get to work every day; working two low-paying jobs; living without a dishwasher or air conditioner; lugging clothes to the laundromat; trying to keep your kids safe in a dangerous neighborhood. PBS could've at least included a participant who makes their living via manual labor in the modern world. There are more construction workers in this country than people who are as wealthy as the Clunes -- if PBS wants to claim the show is about modern Americans and their reaction to 1880s hardships, it would be nice if they acknowleged that some modern Americans still work hard physical labor jobs, wash all their dishes by hand, live on a tight budget, etc.",1155859200,21,1817,4.82051282051282
1843509,5,B00008G7JA,"I've seen all of the DVD's in PBS's The House series. Out of all of them, I'd say that Manor House and Frontier House are the best of them.

Frontier House is pretty realistic in terms of the clothing, the setting and scenarios follow the lives of the original pioneers as closely as possible. Seeing modern day families try and relive that style of life is entertaining and highly engaing and educational. We forget how far we've come from those days in the past and how much we rely on modern day technology. My favorite example is TOILET PAPER!! Not only do these poor folks have to build their own outhouses, they have no toilet paper, only a small tin of water, some leaves or a small rag that has to be cleaned then reused. We forget how lucky we are to have indoor plumbing!

Although the families are not the most engaging because they seem  reluctant to give up modern day conviniences and complain about the harsh lifestyle and hard work, you understand their struggles  and hardships. Watching these familes become more closely knit and work as a team is facinating, and shows just how hard our pioneer ancestors struggles to build lives for themselves.

As the show progresses, we watch new challenges arise, such as running out of food, dealing with livestock, building log cabins and other buildings such as outhouses and chicken coops. Learning how to slaughter and butcher animals is another task that has to be mastered, along with learning to farm.

PBS did a wonderful thing introducing this series of ""time travel"" shows. Not only do we learn about different periods in history, but we learn how modern day people interact and live in these settings.

Ms. Clune really starts the show off on the wrong foot with her belly-aching about makeup even before they hit the trail to go to their homesteads. The two teen girls also were very anachronistic. They wander around in the equivalent of underwear half the time, and refuse to participate in women's work. What's the point of joining a project like frontier house and then acting modern? I was embarrassed when they were dancing around at the fair towards the end in their chemises. I also thought stealing the mattress was a cheap trick.

I liked the Glen family more and sympathized with the wife a great deal. Her husband was a loser and the moment he said he liked Karen but didn't want her kids, I felt he was a complete Jerk. I'd be asking for divorce right then. Karen was one tough Cookie, and I really respected her a great deal. I think Karen was a great character and would be like a frontier wife from those times.

We grew up poor and it was tough, sometimes painful, but you really had to use your wits and try to pull together and work harder than some others but overall my siblings and I had a great and adventurous childhood we wouldn't trade for an easier one. Had to do a lot for ourselves which I'm reminded of whenever I watch this series.
If you love Frontier House and wish you could take your family to Montana and give it a try a real alternative would be to simplify, move into a small house or cabin (even a rental), start a garden, bake your own bread, cook from scratch, get everyone involved in chores, ditch TV, video games, the internet and if you can, cell phones (recommend keeping one landline) and do things together as a family: recreation, work, chores, school/homework, learning traditional crafts and skills, games, vacation/travel (if it's in the budget), use your imagination. But put your family first every day -kids and marriage.
We can actually come close to the FH experiment in modern life, we just have to be less selfish and do things for others without expecting payback and not be so easily dazzled by flickering little devices that go blip-blzzzz in our faces day and night.
