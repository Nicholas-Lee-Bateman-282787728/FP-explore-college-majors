7827066,4,6302530105,"This is definitely not as good as the original, and I also wouldn't say it's as good as part two, but it's still a pretty good movie.  The story is good and Tim Thomerson does a great job as Jack Deth (as he always does).  I was disappointed that Helen Hunt had such a small part and that Art Le Fleur was absent, and I was expecting a little more action.  But if you're a Trancers fan it's still worth adding to your collection.",1487289600,,429,4.083333333333333
7827067,5,6302530105,"First off, Full Moon Entertainment has really done its fans well with the Blu-ray releases of the Trancers series.  As with the previous two movies, the transfer of the third movie is BEAUTIFUL!  Seeing one of my favorite childhood series' in such detail has been enough to bring tears of joy to my eyes.  The sound is top-notch as well, especially with a good sound bar.  One minor criticism is the lack of a subtitle option for the hearing-impaired.  Other than that, this is as close to perfect as you can get with this movie.",1465344000,,529,4.526315789473684

7827069,4,6302530105,"TRANCERS 3 finally comes to blu-ray by Full moon features ALL REGIONS aswell
not a bad 3rd sequel in terms of storyline, the original and the sequel were the best
and then you got Trancers 4 & 5 which get very pathetic, the series was getting run into the Ground by the 4 & 5th sequels
anyway a new HD transfer has been given in new 1:78:1 ratio for the first time ever
the picture quality looks amazing very nice sharp & clear quality much much better than the full screen dvd version
plus the sound quality has been boosted up to new 5.1 surround sound mix again much better audio boost
there's new special features aswell
a new 15min retrospective featurette just for this blu-ray
which is new interview with first time Director Courtney Joyner who talks in Great detail about the making of the film
no other interviews in this featurette, just Courtney Joyner
there's a new Audio commentary with Tim thomerson & Courtney Joyner
very informative commentary about the cast & the production so yes worth listening to
there's also the Videozone behind the scenes featurette from 1991-92 when the film was made
must've been filmed/shot 1 year after trancers II was released in Cinemas
there's Photo stills Gallery & Theatrical trailer
so definitely worth upgrading to this new blu-ray which is ALL REGIONS, so U.K. fans can buy this aswell
much better than the old dvd version
4 stars based on new HD transfer in new 1:78:1 ratio & new extras",1457395200,3,1441,4.654901960784314
7827070,4,6302530105,"Naturally, all SIX of these TRANCERS movies were low budget films with
that zombie-theme. I missed Helen Hunt in later films in the franchise, but
THIS one---half way through---is probably my favorite.",1453593600,,201,5.3125

7827073,5,6302530105,"Trancers III is the best of the Trancers series. A time-traveling cop,Jack Deth(Tim Thomerson)is taken back hundreds of years in the past. He is given the tak of destroying the Trancer program before it has a chance to get out of control which could sent the whole world into a state of chaos and destruction.
You may remeber him in Trancers 1 and II and in Dollman but this movie is one of Tim Thomerson's best ever!
LOOK FOR HIM IN OTHER FULL MOON FILMS!",1013644800,4,456,4.376470588235295
