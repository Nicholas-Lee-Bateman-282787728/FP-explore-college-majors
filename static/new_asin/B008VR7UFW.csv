5186333,3,B008VR7UFW,"When I was 4, the ""Sesame Street Special Christmas"" was horrifying to watch. Where's most of the cast? Where are Ernie and Bert, Grover and Snuffy? Where's Gordon and Susan? Why is everyone singing Broadway style tunes? Who's Leslie Uggams and why should I care about her? Like the ""Star Wars Holiday Special,"" which George Lucas had nothing to do with, the ""Sesame Street Special Christmas"" was a CBS network special that had nothing to do with the Children's Television Workshop...and it shows. This is a dated slice of '70s network TV akin to the types of variety specials routinely being produced at the time, with disparate stars like Anne Murray (lip synching one of her chart topping hits), Michael Jackson, Henry Fonda, Imogene Coca and Ethel Merman all showing up at various points in their efforts to cheer up Oscar and make him find the meaning of Christmas.

Watching it as an adult, it's not the total embarrassment that the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" was -- but it still completely lacks the charm of, say, the classic ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street."" All that's missing is a laugh track to cement it as a product of its time. That said, it still holds a certain fascination for Sesame Street and Muppet fans, mainly for its curiosity value. While most of the human cast appears (Bob, Mr. Hooper, Maria and David), the Muppet involvement begins and ends with Carol Spinney. Big Bird and Oscar are the only muppets to appear here (other than Barkley the dog), presumably because of cost concerns. Producer Bob Banner spent most of his cash on the guest cast list and the show's soundtrack. Speaking of which, in addition to a few Christmas carols and Merman belting out ""Tomorrow"" from ""Annie,"" the special offers a number of original tunes from Broadway composers Larry Grossman and Hal Hackady. They're actually not terrible, either, with the lovely ""Just One Person"" closing tune from their ""Snoopy: The Musical"" making an appearance here at the end. It's just jarring to see this kind of thing inserted into the middle of Sesame Street!

Though apparently licensed and taken right from the broadcast master (the picture quality is immaculate for a videotaped 1978 TV special; not sure what other reviews here were expecting), the show HAS been altered for DVD: the ""Sesame Street"" theme song originally made an instrumental appearance over the beginning and end credits. Apparently for licensing purposes (go figure it's the one aspect this independent label didn't want to spring for), it's been replaced here by a modern-sounding synthesizer ""Christmas"" track, and is especially evident over the end credits.

Overall, this is the kind of thing us grown-Sesame Street viewers will find of interest, and it's fascinating to see it making an appearance on DVD. Despite its shortcomings, it's not as awful as you might remember, especially if you view it less as a Sesame Street production (which it really isn't) and more as the network TV special that it is.",1356048000,,2978,4.9282868525896415
5186334,5,B008VR7UFW,"Are you wondering about the quality of the show? It's not very good. It's a mediocre 1970s TV variety special. However, it is so great that it has been released for the sheer nostalgia factor!",1355443200,,192,4.514285714285714
5186335,4,B008VR7UFW,"This isn't Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, and it isn't the world's greatest Sesame Street special. I burst out laughing at parts that aren't supposed to be funny, because this DVD is just special. There's comments that would not fly on today's Sesame Street, such as Ethel telling people they look like idiots, and people being glad Oscar is apparently gone. I lost it at the part where Ethel randomly bursts into ""Tomorrow"" from Annie, because it's just so random. And then right after that? With Michael Jackson just POPPING UP OUT OF NOWHERE (note: if you have an irrational fear of MJ, this might be a bad choice for you) with his 'fro and everything, you'll laugh at parts that aren't supposed to be funny. But there are redeeming parts of it: the WHOLE version of ""Just One Person"" is sung, not the abridged version that is usually preformed on Sesame Street and the Muppet Show, which is extremely well preformed and my favourite non-Muppet original song that has been preformed for it. And then hey NEWSFLASH: OSCAR HAS A HEART. OSCAR LOVES THE KITTY. Oscar ISN'T a total grouch! Imagine a Christmas Sesame street movie having that!

But oh, the bonus features. There's a ""grooving"" Michael Jackson with DJ Oscar. It looks like something that was made circa 1991 via Windows Movie Maker,  complete with cheesy graphics and godawful music. And ""song mode"" and ""sneak peaks"". Really? This DVD is kind of awesome. Really only for hardcore Muppet/Sesame fans but really? It's kind of special. And awesome. And worth it for the lulz.",1355011200,,1537,4.796226415094339
5186336,5,B008VR7UFW,this sesame strret movie is an old one but its another great sesame street movie. My two little toddlers just love watching sesame street and they loved watching this movie as well. I highly recomend this movie to anyone that has kids that love sesame street!,1354579200,,259,4.6521739130434785
5186337,2,B008VR7UFW,"Let's get this straight: I did NOT buy this because it's a great family Christmas movie that should be ranked up there with the likes of Rudolph and Frosty. I bought this because I am a die-hard Muppet fan and merchandise like this is something I should be in possession of. This movie is actually notorious for being awful and Sesame Street at its lowest. Low-budget, poorly written, not staying true to the characters, and chock-full of pointless celebrity cameos and songs are the terms to accurately describe this movie. Anne Murray singing a random love song (not related in ANY way to Christmas) to Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch out-of-nowhere shredding the electric guitar to ""Yakety Yak,"" and taking a big chunk of time devoted to Leslie Uggams singing ""Accustomed to Your Face"" from a distant window to Oscar are not vital or even relevant to the story, and yet there they are. Not all of the Sesame Street cast (Muppet or human) is used, and filling the rest of the slots is a slew of forced and boring cameos (Michael Jackson probably appears for a span of one minute... if that. I don't know why he is so large on the cover) adding nothing to the storyline (Ethel Merman stands and sings ""Tomorrow"" from Annie after declaring that Imogene Coca looks like an idiot). The writing does not stay true to the character's personalities, with Oscar lovingly adopting a wounded kitten off the street and Maria being nothing more than Leslie Uggam's butt-kisser (for lack of a better term).
It's not just the film itself that is low-budget. The actual DVD case design too, is like that of an illegal bootleg. With reviews like ""MJ and Oscar... Priceless!"" from myvidnow.com (I'm not kidding) and a bland, anything-but-pleasing-to-the-eye, handmade logo, the case itself is almost laughable. So, sure, if you are a Muppet fan and want to own this awfully awful Christmas special, go nuts. For everyone else looking for just a good family Christmas movie, keep searching.",1352592000,24,1969,4.811209439528024
5186338,5,B008VR7UFW,"While I may love Christmas music during the Holiday Season, I've grown tired of some of the classics and was in need of a fresh batch of Christmas Music. Once I listened to this CD, I was instantly hooked on some of the classic songs sung by old school favorites like, Anne Murray, Leslie Uggams and a new original song by Oscar the Grouch and Michael Jackson. A fun, new, and exciting Christmas CD for everyone!",1352332800,,412,4.434210526315789
5186339,5,B008VR7UFW,"This special Sesame Street Christmas special aired in 1978 and was nominated for an emmy.  What makes it so special is that it has NOT been seen since its original air date and was the only Sesame Street special ever made that wasn't produced by the childrens television workshop!  It was produced by legendary variety show producer, Bob Banner and featured a TON of huge stars including Michael Jackson and Henry Fonda!  It also has an incredible new Michael Jackson bonus track on it.  I would highly recommend getting the soundtrack as well which is available on CD.  Anne Murray sings her classic hit YOU NEEDED ME to Big Bird, Ethel Merman sings TOMORROW, and much more.  Very cool, very nostalgic, very fun to watch for the whole family!  Got me in the Christmas spirit!",1352246400,,776,4.703703703703703
5186340,1,B008VR7UFW,"I bought it because it showed Michael Jackson on the cover.  He only had a minor roll with Oscar The Grouch.  He did not sing any, maybe bedause he was a Jehovahs Witness and they do not celebrate Christmas.  I was very disappointed with the video.",1381190400,,248,4.3478260869565215
5186341,5,B008VR7UFW,"Oh my gosh...this was such fun to see ""old"" friends from Sesame Street !
What I enjoyed the most (my kids and granddaughter as well) was that Oscar had a staring roll. When my son was little we found out that Oscar and I have the same birthday...June 1. So Oscar is a favorite in our house.
 Thank-you Sesame Street for putting this production on dvd !
We tend to watch Christmas movies in the summer...keeps you cool in the ""dog days"" of a MI summer. (:-)",1377043200,2,456,4.241379310344827
5186342,4,B008VR7UFW,kinda disappointed. i was hoping michael was going to sing too. they should have release it as a special bonus feature on the dvd.,1368144000,,130,4.458333333333333
5186343,5,B008VR7UFW,"Michael Jackson is the special guest on this Sesame Street program. Both Michael and Sesame Street are timeless, and I grew up with both Michael and Sesame Street in my life. I had to have this dvd and I'm so glad I do. You should have it too. It's adorable and very enjoyable for anyone, at any age.",1362960000,,300,4.189655172413793
5186344,1,B008VR7UFW,"Only if you enjoy something so bad it's good could I ever recommend this.  It is jaw-droppingly awful, and all the other reviews that criticize it are dead on.  Two quick additions to these reviews to emphasize what a shoddy production this was:  Couldn't a hairdresser at least have made an attempt to comb poor Ethel Merman's rat's nest of a hairdo?  And Henry Fonda??  He comes out for a 16-second non sequitor.  WTF???

Secondly, the DVD is a complete ripoff.  The ""Special Features"" of a still picture of Michael Jackson rocking back and forth are downright insulting.

And to the people who gave this a positive review - no, on second thought, there is nothing I can say.",1360454400,2,677,4.621848739495798
5186345,2,B008VR7UFW,"Although I was a Sesame Street devotee when this was first on television, I had never seen it.  Had I seen this as a child, I would have been disappointed.  Even bored.  My favorite Muppets were not there, the pacing and timing of Sesame Street was not there, and the storyline was rather drab.  Even a child of 5 or 6 could have sensed that something other than creativity, community, and diversity were at stake in this ""special.""  Perhaps a 5 year old would not have known enough about utility to grasp that people were simply making money with Sesame Street in this awful show, but a 5 year old would have felt the difference between this and, say, other Christmas specials on Sesame Street.

What I now find interesting in this DVD, though, is not so much a silent cameo of Michael Jackson (who apparently cannot even be *named* in the episode without violating contract agreements).  And it is certainly not the singing of some forgotten diva.

Rather what I find interesting is the fact that this episode can serve as an object lesson for how the Sesame Street of Jim Henson and Joe Raposo is different from the Sesame Street of today.  With Henson and Raposo, and with the writers and editors of the previous Sesame Street, creativity, intelligence, humor, and diversity leaped off the screen and into the thoughts and actions of children and adults.  The rhythm, music, and laughter was infectious and contagious.  Without them, this Christmas special was an object lesson for what we have now on PBS under the same name.  Boredom, repetition, the teaching of very basic skills, the continuous churning out of sub-par music, the soulless embodiment of an ever more colorful (yet empty) cast of characters.

People matter.  And creative genuiuses matter.  When the greatness turns completely to commercialism, great talent stays away.  Thank goodness Henson and Raposo had the foresight to stay away from this Christmas special.  Their memory would be tarnished.

I really wish they were both still with us.  I miss them.",1360281600,3,2029,4.84593023255814
5186346,1,B008VR7UFW,"Others have covered the main points, so I'll keep this short.  As a DIE-HARD, life-long SS fan (we're even the same age, both debuting in '69), I didn't even REMEMBER this ""special"" special.  After watching it, I know why; obviously, I BLOCKED it from my memory.  Just like the dreaded ""Star Wars Holiday Special"", this undertaking is long, drawn-out, chok-ful of 70's stars (Leslie Ugghams; what WAS she famous for, anyway?), and INCREDIBLY, MIND-NUMBINGLY BORING.  And the biggest offense?  This IS Sesame Street, so, WHERE ARE THE MUPPETS?!?  NO Grover, Cookie, Bert & Ernie, Kermit...just Big Bird and Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, and Oscar.  Oh, and Oscar.  Did I mention this focuses on Oscar?  Stick with the EXCELLENT ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street"", and AVOID this train-wreck like the PLAGUE.",1359244800,3,795,5.10077519379845

5186348,3,B008VR7UFW,"Having read the plot of this movie online, I knew how lame it was and didn't expect anything great from it. The bonus features were more disappointing. Bad versions of Christmas songs and a remix of Michael Jackson's lines in the movie? We could have just done without a bonus.",1357430400,,277,4.56
5186349,2,B008VR7UFW,"In viewing ""A Special Sesame Street Christmas,"" I just have seen perhaps the only strikeout involving ""Sesame Street"" that I ever have before.

Those who are true longtime Star Wars fans are familiar with the embarrassment that was ""The Star Wars Holiday Special."" It never has seen the light of day on home video, and for good reason.

I'm afraid that this is the Children's Television Workshop's version of that. It's only now making it to video release, and the story behind it is that it was a prime-time network ""Sesame Street"" Christmas special released in the same year (1978) as ANOTHER ""Sesame Street"" Christmas special, ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,"" which aired on PBS. THAT special is gorgeous, memorable and certainly among the top 25 Christmas specials of all time.

THIS special is a desolate wasteland of cameo walk-throughs and horrible writing that I have trouble watching without falling asleep. The script is bad; the music is bad; the singing is bad; the production values are DEFINITELY not up to typical ""Sesame Street"" standards.

Clearly the network producers involved felt that they needed to shoehorn as many names into this mess as possible in order to get people to watch, so now you've got this weird hodge-podge of strangers meandering through the familiar neighborhood: Anne Murray lip syncs ""You Needed Me"" to Big Bird (which is THE song that I'd choose to sing to an 8-foot yellow bird with the mentality of a second grader); Ethel Merman pops in to split everybody's eardrums; Henry Fonda reads a newspaper; Dickie Smothers shows up without his brother.

The largest bit of charlatanism involved with this DVD's distribution is putting Michael Jackson on the front cover and mentioning him prominently on the back. Jackson, original nose intact, literally walks through one scene. His entire portion of the production clocks in at around 27 seconds. He doesn't sing, doesn't dance and doesn't even really break stride as he moves across the stage.

Other highlights:

-A cat with a bandaged leg that may or may not have been drugged but definitely was mishandled, meowing consistently and uncomfortable to watch;

-A big fat total of three Muppets (Oscar, who gets the lion's share of screen time; Big Bird; and Barkley, whom I didn't even realize was around as far back as 1978);

-Leslie Uggams (no idea who she is) with her two visible Uggams;

-Several child actors who appear to be as enthusiastic about this special as I am--one boy in particular looked as though he'd rather have been at a dental appointment.

It's a stinker and a giant disappointment. Clearly there is a good reason why this thing hasn't been released for all these years. Pass on it.",1356220800,3,2698,4.920704845814978
