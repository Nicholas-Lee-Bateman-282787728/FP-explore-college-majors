4577731,1,B0055HK6V6,"This series is flawed in so many ways that I am surprised that the makers would actually air its segments. It is so inaccurate in so many ways that one can only assume that the producers have not done any serious researchers into the battles depicted. North Africa, France 1940, Barbarossa, Normandy, the Ardennes, Stalingrad, and on and on and on,... it is terrible. Save your money for a properly researched book and pass on this series. The series is not even worth watching for free on the various history networks much less owning these.",1327449600,5,542,4.71578947368421
4577732,3,B0055HK6V6,"Interesting DVD - The battles were detailed and informational, but the animations were not as good as I expected, far below the quality of todays games and cgi movies. A few of the tanks were not dimensionally accurate, especially the M4 Sherman.",1325462400,,246,4.880952380952381
4577733,3,B0055HK6V6,"I have watched this series on the Military channel. I find it very interesting and like the use of CGI animation to illustrate various scenes. I am not sure of the accuracy of this series. I watched the program about the destruction of part of the Republican Guard but it only dealt with one armored cavalry regiment whereas in reality the 3rd armored and the 1st infantry divisions fought numerous battles over a three day period- including the Battle of Norfolk a day or two after Easting 73. At Norfolk much of the fight took place in a series of Wadi's. In this TV series everything is handled by the one armored cavalry regiment and that's just not accurate. Moroever, in one scene illustarting via CGI Captain McMaster's Troop moving into a ""tanks lead"" formation nine M-1s move forward and pass four Bradley M-2s so that the M-2s are protected by a wedge of heavy tanks.... Armored Cavalry Regiments are organized into three armored Sqaudrons  with each Sqaudron has three Troops- but the Troops are composed of Nine M-1 tanks and *twelve* M-2 Bradleys... so what happened to the other eight M-2s?",1324857600,2,1104,4.75
4577734,5,B0055HK6V6,"This is a fascinating dvd set. It uses great quality computer images, very realistic most of the time. It covers the Battle of the Bulge, 2 from Kursk, a Canadian unit in Rhineland, Gulf War, 1973 Israel, and D-Day. Highly recommended for a fan of this type of thing.",1323734400,3,267,4.469387755102041
4577735,5,B0055HK6V6,The first reviewer totally nails how CGI makes this documentary so good and I agree with him 100%. It takes info many of us WWII history buffs already know about tanks & battles and 'fills in the gaps' that exisisting film of the events can't provide. If you are a fan of Military History--you will love this DVD!,1321660800,25,313,4.413793103448276
4577736,5,B0055HK6V6,"When CGI came around, it was impressive to see space battles and giant alien robots, but what really thrilled me were movies that recreated history in a way not possible until this new technology. With grim scale, ENEMY AT THE GATE showed us the Battle of Stalingrad. Hokey as it may be, even Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR delivered a view of World War II unimaginable to the epic filmmakers of the 1960, who had to shoot THE LONGEST DAY, THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, or A BRIDGE TOO FAR on a grand scale, with casts of thousands and every refurbished airplane, tank and half track they could gather together (and repaint) from Spain and Eastern Europe.

GREATEST TANK BATTLES, a Canadian production that mimics the DOGFIGHTS series, shows us another brilliant use for computer generated imagery. As informative and nearly as exciting as a video game, GREATEST TANK BATTLES delivers stories of armored combat told by the participants and recreated with amazingly impressive CGI. The First Gulf War is covered, along with the Arab-Israel conflict, but most of the action occurs during World War II and is told from both sides of the European front, by former US, Canadian, Russian, and German soldiers in their onw vivid words.

Highly recommended, and the best tank fighting you will ever see--until Michael Bay decides to remake THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, anyway.

2013 ADDENDEM: Why, oh why has Season Two of this tremendous show not been released on DVD??? That's a crime!",1320624000,65,1489,4.854330708661418

4577760,4,B0055HK6V6,"This is a great documentary series produced in Canada. Beginning with WW 2 tank battles, the series later explored early tank battles/tank employment in WW 1 as well as later armored engagements in Korea (1950-53), Vietnam (1961-75), the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War of October, 1973, and the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91.  Well-done CGI graphics are blended with documentary film footage and interviews with living veterans. The series also uses passages from narratives written by commanders and soldiers who fought in these battles, and commentary  from military historians who have studied armored warfare and its key campaigns.

4577793,5,B0055HK6V6,"OH MY GOODNESS!!!! I absolutely LOVE this DVD series! Since I'm familiar with Dogfights(of which I have all the episodes on DVD), it's obvious to me that this is the exact same thing as Dogfights, minus the focus on planes. I got this for Christmas and I'm HOOKED!! It's realistic, hugely entertaining, and just plain awesome, this series delivers a tankfist full of action. Like Dogfights, there are interviews with the people who piloted/drove certain military vehicles, CGI animation, narration, war footage, and analysis of military vehicles(in this case, tanks). It shows you how much armor a certain tank has( For example, Sherman 2 inches and Tiger 4 inches), the weight(the King Tiger weighing at 77 tons), firepower(75mm gun and 88mm gun, as examples) and speed. As a military lover, I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in military weaponry. However, if there's one complaint I have about this series, it's that Season 2 has STILL not come out yet. The only way you can watch Season 2 is by watching it via amazon video(by streaming of course), but I don't want to do that because I'm old-fashioned when it comes to purchasing videos, so I prefer having the entire DVD in my hands. Although it's a shame that Season 2 still has not come out yet, this is definitely worth the buy, and is well worth the money. GREAT Christmas present!!",1419811200,,1358,4.832618025751073

Yeah, I know that's a personal choice, but watching these via a PC instead of a 60"" HD television with mega-watt amps and sub-woofers simply isn't the same.

4577817,4,B0055HK6V6,"I watched those series with interest and I don't regret buying them, but they are not as good as I hoped.

PRECISION : this is only the Season 1 of the series; as of April 2014, to the best of my knowledge the season 2 was not yet released on DVD

Generally speaking, those series are a well done thing and an interesting viewing, but nowhere nearly as good and as well done as ""Dogfihts"" or ""Battlefield 360"" about USS ""Enterprise"". CGIs, albeit honest, are here less good as those in two series mentioned before. Narration is somehow simplified and ""dumbed down"" - something that I think was not necessary.

In some episodes the real war time footage is poorly used - like in the episode about the Battle of Bulge in which we can see... some Panzer III with short 50 mm gun (a model phased out already in 1942) and even some Panzer II tanks (I am not kidding!). In the same episode in fact we can see German infantry advancing through wide fields illuminated by brilliant sun and covered with wheat ready to be harvested (clearly some footage from Russia) - when this battle took place in a snowy, freezing December...

An annoying thing is that almost every single shot fired hits its target - and the target immediately explodes in flames! That allows to speed up the action, but in the same time it diminishes greatly the realism of the series. Also, in some episodes, German tanks and assault guns are butchered by bushels incredibly easily - which I think was not entirely the case. OK, granted, Germany of course lost the war - but Panthers, Tigers, Stug-IIIs and other Jagdpanzer IVs were NOT easy meat!

There are 10 episodes in this season:

1. ""The Battle of 73 Easting"". A 1991 Gulf War's battle between American 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment equipped with M1A1 Abrams and one of Iraq's elite Republican Guard units which used T-72s. A GOOD, interesting episode, even if the fight was really one sided.

2. ""The October War: Battle for the Golan Heights"". In 1973 Israeli reserve tank units equipped mostly with WWII vintage Centurions face the main force of Syrian Army equipped with more modern T-55 and T-62 tanks. A VERY GOOD episode!

3. ""The Battle of El Alamein"". This episode describes in fact almost all the 1942 campaign in Nort Africa, including the Gazala battle and of course culminating in October-November 1942 when an exhausted Rommel's Afrika Corps faces freshly re-equipped Montgomery's Eighth Army. Many tank types are shown, including M3 Lee and Crusaders. A GOOD episode, even if by necessity superficial and at the end the fight is very one sided.

4. ""The Battle of the Bulge: Race to Bastogne"". In December 1944, German forces launch a surprise attack through the Ardennes Forest in Belgium. This is the story of the American tankers who helped defend the American line against Hitler's final gamble on the western front. A GOOD episode.

5. ""The Battle for the Hochwald Gap"". In February 1945, the First Canadian Army launches an attack to cross the Rhine and enter the German heartland. This is the story of the struggle for the Hochwald Gap  an obstacle Germans, even at that stage of war,  were determined to hold at any cost. A GOOD episode.

6. ""The Battle of the Bulge: SS Panzers Attack!"". In December 1944, an SS tank force leads Hitler's final offensive in the west. This is the story of the 6th Panzer Army's and especially of the Kampfgruppe Peiper incredible breakthrough of the American line and subsequent encirclement and defeat. A GOOD episode.

7. ""The Battle of Normandy"". On June 6, 1944, the Allies land on the northern coast of France. This is the story of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade as they fight their way inland. Although containg a couple of good scenes, that episode is not as good as previous ones and I think that the excruciatingly difficult fight in the infamous Normand ""bocage"" is not shown here as well as it should be.

8. ""The Battle of Arracourt"". By September 1944, Patton's hard-charging Third Army threatens to breech the German border. This is the story of the largest tank-vs-tank clash of the Western Front, as Hitler masses hundreds of panzers in a desperate bid to halt Patton's advance. A honest episode, even if in reality the quickly raised ad-hoc Panther brigades (devoided of anti-aircraft protection) were more savaged by allied aviation than by Patton's tanks...

9. ""The Battle of Kursk: Northern Front"". In the summer of 1943, Hitler launches a massive armoured offensive in an effort to regain the upper hand on the Eastern Front. This is the story of the formidable Russian defense that stalls a massive panzer onslaught on the Northern shoulder of the Kursk salient. This was a monumental fight - and it is shown here in a disappointing way...

10. ""The Battle of Kursk: Southern Front"". The Battle of Kursk comes to a climax at the Battle of Prokhorovka on July 12, 1943. This is the story of the largest tank battle in military history, as elite SS troops face off against Russian defenders determined to stop them whatever the cost. This episode is again a disappointment - the monumental battle of Prokhorovka deserved much better than that...

Now, don't get me wrong - those are good series, I liked them and I do intend to purchase the second season as soon as it is available. However, they are not as good as the amazing ""Dogfights"". Still, a must for all military history freaks. Enjoy!",1398297600,2,5396,4.740661686232658

The battles are depicted using operational maps, CGI animations of tank combat graphics that would stand proudly alongside even the best video games, and either interviews with actual participants or narrations of written, firsthand accounts.

Anyone who is well versed in tank battle history would take note of inaccuracies and some have posted their reviews here to point that error out.

History is subject matter many people are not that interested.  I think the producer did admirable job to make it visually entertaining.  Using computer graphics you get see and hear what it is like to sit and fight on a tank from various tank battles.

If this series can make history interesting enough for a viewer to want to research more then I think it has accomplished its job.",1381017600,,699,4.688524590163935

While it is interesting and often exciting to watch war films that sometimes include an overabundance of fictitious drama, such is not the case here.  The animation of these tragic and incredibly destructive events is extraordinary, and often shows the ""tragedy and destruction"" through the eyes of those who participated in the battles.  I am sure that many members of ""Our Greatest Generation"" who actually participated in the conflicts own the series.  This is definitely a good investment for those viewers who like both the drama and reality of ""how battle really is.""",1373155200,2,703,5.140350877192983

This show, with its detailed descriptions of armor and weaponry has encouraged my 7 year old to draw and design his own tanks.",1370476800,,291,4.471698113207547
4577845,3,B0055HK6V6,"What we have here is ten hours of Tank History, dealing with mostly the World War Two period, but also touching on other tank battles of post-war period.  Post-war of course being post-World War Two.
While there are a lot of veterans and first person accounts, which is awesome, we have to remember that their memories are flawed by time and their own age.  Also, the show is known for its inaccuracies.  For example, I agree that the Battle of Kursk should have two episodes about it, as it is likely one of the biggest and most important battle on the Eastern Front, if not the whole war in Europe.  And as a American my military history books on World War Two barely cover it.  But we have to understand we getting two view points of the same events, both from the German and the Russian troops and histories, which were than crushed together for entertainment.  So you have to take it with a pinch of salt.
Also some people would look at the Battle of Alamein as a battle, mostly, between units of artillery and infantry, with armor in minor roles.  If I remember right, a lot of the battles in Africa were decided by supply issues and air power.  That does not decrease the importance of tanks, their speed and firepower in a mostly flat terrain, but many times they were not as major a factor as we would like to think.
The show also repeats itself, a lot, and of course being made for TV it has those blank moments where the commercials were meant to go.  So a lot of that ten hours is repeating the same information and the same computer effects.  Seems to have been made for the Military Channel and a tad on the cheap side.  Kind of like watching a tank game for the Play Station Two.  On one hand it seems to work and I would got really into the battle scenes.  Other times I noticed the lack of any ground troops and I felt a tad cheated, thinking how weird it was to see guns aim themselves, and instead of enjoying the show I felt disbelief.  Still, at the price it is not that bad and should join your DVD library.  May I also suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Panzers/dp/B000V6LTA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Panzers</a>&nbsp;if you have a interest in the development of the German Tank during World War Two?

4577848,4,B0055HK6V6,"Before getting this set I was impressed with the occasional snippet of an episode I caught on History Channel. Greatest Tank Battles endeavors to show us what tank engagements were like at Normandy, the Ardennes, Kursk, the Golan, and so on. The episodes feature men who took part in these battles as tank crewmen, as well as historians who put the ""big picture"" in perspective. Using computer-generated images the show does a good job, but it has its limitations.

For one thing, the commercial break sequences are still in. I question the need to sum up what happened during the segment before the break in such detail when IT WAS ONLY FIVE MINUTES AGO. We're not talking about something we saw last week. But if that's not bad enough, why leave it in the collected series version? The effect is a virtual repeat of what was on the screen only a minute ago. You constantly feel as if you are having an attack of deja vu. Couldn't the producers have edited the cuts out so it would be a smoother product? I especially think that the two Kursk episodes could have been combined into one slightly longer episode which would have done a much better job of telling the story.

Also, once you start watching you realize that it has been very sanitized. There are rarely any people portrayed, dead of otherwise. This is especially bizarre in the case of antitank guns, whose crews would have been VERY visible. I'm not saying actually show a tank commander get decapitated, but certainly there would be bodies around destroyed artillery pieces. CGI has problems with highly dynamic events, such as fires and explosions which sometimes distracts.

Overall though, a good product. If you just view CGI as an illustration tool and not necessarily the feature itself it is very eye-opening.",1362787200,2,1781,4.775974025974026

4577852,5,B0055HK6V6,These historical tank battles were well done. They had a great narrator with insight from real veterans who fought in these battles.

Yes there are some errors in the CGI films in terms of the tanks' details but they are still entertaining and give a good sense of what took place during the battles.

4577856,2,B0055HK6V6,"Interviews with veterans are great but that is where the good news end. This is pop history with serious errors, incomplete research, inaccurate CGI, etc. Still, it is enough to spark interest and imagination so that's a plus. Watch it to get some perspective on the horrors of war from people who were there, but then do your own research.

Another, rather annoying fact, is that the documentary literally repeats itself endlessly every 10-15 min or so, because it was designed for commercial breaks. So, multiple times during one episode, the screen goes blank momentarily (where the commercials would be) and then, immediately starts summarizing the entire episode up to that point, to allow for short span of an average viewer who must have ""forgot"" everything over the commercial break! So, there is actually a lot less material than the length of the episodes may lead you to believe.",1335052800,8,890,4.973154362416107
4577857,4,B0055HK6V6,"First off, I'm glad someone made this series, but they could have made it better.  The most glaring thing is the music is way too loud.  They are trying to have music, battle sounds and interviews with veterans all going at the same time, and the music drowns out everything.  In my opinion they shouldn't even have music while the guy is talking.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, it's kind of weird with no humans at all in the recreated scenes.  Third, sometimes their scale is way off, with what should be 300 yards seeming more like 25.  One other thing, it gets kind of irritating when they repeat things as if you forgot what they just said five minutes ago.  This may have to do with my watching it on the Military Channel.  They repeat what they just showed you after every commercial break.  I don't know if this is present in the DVD series, but it seems like they are trying to stretch an extra fifteen minutes into the program.  That said, they did a good job with the graphics and I found the interviews with the veterans very interesting.  I am also pleased that someone can somewhat bring to life battles that I had to envision in my head before, without knowing exactly what the terrain looked like, etc.  I highly recommend this series, but it does have its faults.",1333497600,6,1287,4.476394849785407

4577860,4,B0055HK6V6,"I don't know what the one star reviewer is complaining about. In fact the battles depicted in this series are accurate. The complaints about the effects are a waste of time too. This is a canadian show that is also shown on the Military Channel and they don't have the budget for supergreat effects. One could complain about the bloodless nature of the show. The do show real pictures of dead bodies and burning tanks. But in the recreated scenes you don't see humans at all. Which wasn't the case mostly. So this is a cleaned up version of the battles. However it really does give you a idea of the terrible battles that people have gone through! It's engaging and awesome in spite of the fact that it's cgi. It also includes interviews from people who were actually at these battles.  I would say that anyone interested in tanks or military history should be pleased with this series. I hope they make a series 3 , at this point there is only 20 episodes.
