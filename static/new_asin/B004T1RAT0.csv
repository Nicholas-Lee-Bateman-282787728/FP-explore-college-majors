8440463,5,B004T1RAT0,Great show on DVD. Watching something that was filmed in the mid 80's that reflects the beginning of the rock n roll era. Well choreographed dancing and a good documentary as well.  The music is great.,1436400000,,201,4.583333333333333

8440467,5,B004T1RAT0,"I originally taped this off the old late nite TV show Night Flight. Watched it faithfully all these years and have always enjoyed it and the little plot that is woven in. Yes, it's a music video but it's a great one and if you are a fan of this kind of swinging music it's well worth it. One thing to be aware of is that even tho Charlie Watts, Ron Wood and Bill Wyman are making music it's not Rolling Stones music by any means.",1392422400,,429,4.0
8440468,5,B004T1RAT0,"I remember this music and the videos from the 1980's and had always been a huge fan of all of the great artists involved in this stellar group project. Bill Wyman, Ronnie Woods, Charlie Watts from the Rolling Stones, Ronnie Lane, Andy Fairweather Low, Chris Rea, Paul Rodgers and Jimmie Page, just to name a few. The music is wonderful and it brings back such great memories of a gentler time!",1390780800,,393,4.549295774647887
8440469,5,B004T1RAT0,"a really truly terrific roll and roll album...if you like R & R, this is a must album....old time original R & R....Willie is Bill Wyman form the Rolling Stones.",1350345600,3,161,4.4
8440470,2,B004T1RAT0,"Judge Victor Valdivia, DVD Verdict-- Don't be misled by the packaging: this is not a concert DVD. It's a longform music video in which the core of the Poor Boys band, mainly Wyman, Watts, Jones, and Wood, accompanied by singer Chris Rea and session musicians such as guitarist Andy Fairweather-Low, pretend to perform for a '50s audience in a small dance club as they lip-sync to songs from the album. There's a very loose storyline in which the club's owner holds a dance contest and ends up patronizing the club's janitor, played in a very brief cameo by Ringo Starr (thus making hash of the DVD's claim that this marks ""a collaboration between members of the Beatles and The Rolling Stones""). There's elaborately choreographed dancing and bad acting, but no actual live performances.

Clocking in at a mere 30 minutes, this is as slight and forgettable visually as you might expect. By the standards of music videos of the era (this was released only four years after the launch of MTV), Willie and the Poor Boys is a nice supplement but it adds nothing to the album. At least a documentary about the recording of the album would have interesting, partly to hear these major artists talk about the music they grew up with and also to hear more about Lane and his battles with MS (he eventually died of the disease in 1997). Even a tribute concert might have been worth seeing, if only for a song or two. This, on the other hand, is just pointless. Maybe back in 1985, this would have been a decent extra but given that the album ultimately had a negligible commercial and artistic impact means that this is hardly worth an entire DVD release to itself.

8440471,1,B004T1RAT0,"i'm not sure what to think about this release and why it was even released.first of all, the quality of this movie/concert isn't that great. it's like they were trying to make a 50's dance hop complete with 50's garb etc. i can't tell if the band is really playing or acting.secondly the whole movie is about 25 minutes long with a 30 minute making of video on the back end to fill the space.not worth the money.bill wyman should have just kept this for his own private collection.",1309478400,,481,4.415730337078652
