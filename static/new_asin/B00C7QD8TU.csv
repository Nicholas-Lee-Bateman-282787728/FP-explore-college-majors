8578385,3,B00C7QD8TU,"This 60 minute DVD asks many questions and presents many theories and is not really able to come up with definitive answers.

In 1994 a group of people find bones in a cave that at first are assumed to be 60 or 70 years old from the Spanish Civil War. After examination there are questions if there was Neanderthal cannibalism. They are able to discern that there are bones of adults, teenagers and children. There has not been evidence of cannibalism in Neanderthals before and it is not known how this group died.

The film takes us through attempted DNA investigations and to other locations on the Iberian Peninsula.
The story is not a smooth one. Scientists talk on screen about their theories and we see their work in laboratories. At many points it is really not clear what their goals are...to show if there was cannibalism or why the Neanderthals died off or what new vision of Neanderthals they come up with.
There are English subtitles and video description.",1386288000,4,969,4.694117647058824
8578386,2,B00C7QD8TU,"Scientists find a cave with many bones, including those of neanderthal, close together.  They ask if this means the beings associated with each other or if their bones just got smushed together by chance.  While I hate when separate doc topics repeat the same old stuff, this one didn't spell out enough who and what neaderthals were.  This reminds me of an ""American Experience"" episode in which they covered an 18th-century midwife, but didn't contextualize her outside of her diaries.  This looked at one site and didn't get enough general information.  I just was not satisfied.",1371340800,5,582,5.020833333333333
