8099704,5,B000CNGC8E,"Film Review: `The Orchestra'
by Zbigniew Rybczynski

Throughout my life, I have consistently nourished and humored the fond belief that I am an intellectual of some substance. Today, however, after more than 64 years of life on the planet and confronted at every turn by the ineluctably obvious mediocrity of my own life's events, I am so well versed in the limits of my relatively modest merits and so mindful of my substantial failings that I must now finally concede that mine is actually a very pedestrian, second rate pseudo-intellectual awareness at best (boo-hoo!).

 The clear evidence of this has been with me since my earliest days, since standard IQ testing in academic years (secondary school) produced a disappointing intelligence quotient of about 130, a rating far from qualifying as anything of extraordinary merit or exceptional substance. Following true to demonstrated form and regardless of these blunt and impartial assessments, my ego has persisted in its myopic self-regard as being something special (or at least more special than the norm). Naturally enough, and in keeping with several social psychology studies done in the past decade or so that demonstrate avalid inverse relationship between IQ and true intellectual self-regard (the lower the intelligence, the higher one's regard for one's true cerebral capabilities), I seem to have refused to accept my inherent limitations of potential and have blithely maintained the gratuitous self-deception until very recently.

One of the limitations that a pseudo-intellectual often must cope with is the inability to carry volumes of facts and knowledge entirely within one's head. To rationalise that glitch in my unfailing regard for self, I have frequently maintained in defense that there are actually two types of superior human intelligence in evidence among most groups of people: those individuals who know a great many things without having to refer to outside sources of factual data, and those who, lacking that skill, are still able to identify outside data sources and access them appropriately on a PRN (medical shorthand 'as needed') basis. In other words, there are those who have so many specially polarized brain cells that they are able to carry their resource library almost exclusively and entirely within their heads; in contrast, there are those (like myself) who are merely skilled at finding the requisite data when and when they need to. These two groups are well removed from the 'average' individual in contemporary American society who confuses 'opinions' for 'facts', and who routinely enshrines emotionally reactive and highly personalised feelings as unassailable documentation of the first order (in my opinion...a bit of irony here, perhaps?...a good example of this last group may be found in those delightfully uncomplicated `Tea Party Patriot' populists we hear so much about these days).

At any rate, if you are by now wondering where this ruminative soliloquy is headed, I reference all the above as an excuse for having all too frequently failed to be aware of certain basic nuances of contemporary culture that are so startling (when finally encountered) in their significance as to constitute a failed awareness process of disturbing magnitude in their omission.

One such recent example of this is my tardy recognition of a brilliant contemporary Polish experimental film maker named Zbigniew Rybczynski (pronounced 'Rib-shin-ski'). So great has been this nave personal oversight of mine that I am reminded of that humorous slam against conventional lower-class economic medicrity that goes (more or less), ""A year ago I couldn't even pronounce `rocket scientist'; now I are one!""  If you are yourself not aware of exactly who Rybczynski is, or what form his particular genius has taken, let me enlighten you, but first, a bit of retrospective stage-setting.

Back in the early 90s, I was an expatriate American living and working for the Saudi Arabian Government. The 'living' part of this undertaking usually consisted of sharing a flat with a number of other expatriates of many different nationalities. Over the course of my decade of so of work among the Saudis, this found me quartered with Egyptians, French, Germans, English, Filipinos, Australians, PRC Chinese, an occasional Scandinavian or two, and more than a few fellow Mercans (a southern style English dialectical idiom for 'Americans'). At one point, I was living with two Ozzies (from Australia, or 'Oz') and a Brit (who gave regular evidence of feeling vaguely put-upon, having to share living facilities with former colonials). Thus it was that a particularly hot Riyadh summer evening (that's akin to saying the Arctic winter is cold, of course) found us all home at the same time. The weather outside the compound was gusty, with the threat of an impending sand storm hanging over us like a Kite (the bird, not the flying airfoil) rising in a simoom (a characteristic sere desert wind) and we were predictably bored, yet again.

The compound, maintained for us by the Saudi Government was actually quite nice, all considered, with large, spacious rooms, an air conditioner in every window, wall to wall carpets, and all the furnishings of an upscale American home for the most part. We even had a super-size television that was linked to an international orbital satellite relay, offering us an almost incomprehensibly broad range of television programming from all parts of the planet. There was even an `in-house' TV studio serving the entire compound that would feature a daily program of illegally copied movies from the USA and other Western nations. Many of these films had been simply recorded directly off American television channels on a VCR complete with commercials and with no effort made to edit out the advertisements. Perversely, since life in the Kingdom was so 'different', because of this fact small reminders of American culture (like ads) were more often valued as welcome reminders of the 'home' culture we had been away from for so long.

So there we were, all of us sprawled on various divans and sofas, unmotivated even to go downtown to cruise the large Saudi shopping malls to gawk at the cane-toting Muttawa'ain (religious police) and hunkered down to wait out the gathering sandstorm with bored resignation. Someone switched the TV on then and started flipping through the channels in the time-honored manner with the remote control when suddenly a passing channel's fare caught my eye. Framed in the tube's all-seeing luminous eye was a curious mix of visual and auditory inputs that met my puzzled gaze, seeming to consist of a sound-track of classical (western) music with what struck me as superimposed avant-garde visuals. Since I have long been a fan of classical music, I suggested to my sidiyks (Arab word for 'friends') that we hold on this channel to get a better feeling for what it offered. The channel turned out to be the previously referenced 'house movie channel' and a check of the scheduled programming for it revealed that this was a PBS 'Great Performances' program selection that someone back in the states had recorded a few weeks earlier and flown over via courier flight.

For me, it was another one of those moments similar to the one I mentioned in an earlier review of the sci-fi themed 'FINAL APPROACH' film, and to say the visuals were somewhat unusual would be understating things considerably.  As my flat-mates and I watched this surprising program, we initially struggled to understand exactly what it was and what was being said by the director. Lacking any knowledge of Zbigniew Rybczynski's film work at that point in my life, I was at a complete loss for some sort of defining meaning, but as the 57 minutes of this film gradually played through I was sublimely captured by the whole experience. My most immediate impression was that here was something that required greater analysis, closer focus and more leisurely study, so I contacted one of our local studio techs and asked him to make me a VHS copy of the program. He did this and it was delivered a short time later. Due to the fact that there were some various bits of nudity in the film, the copy delivered to me had all the explicit shots of breasts and genitals `fuzzed' out (Saudi Islamic culture is austerely conservative, of course), sadly enough, but at least I had a copy of my own that I could view at my leisure.

The film in reference, titled 'The Orchestra', was (as I later found out) a cooperative PBS high definition production initially produced for the Japanese domestic market that might be described as (in its simplest definition) a 'music video'.  Since Japan had high definition television programming for almost 15 years before it came to the United States, the version shown on Public Broadcasting stations (WNET) lacked the astounding clarity of the HD original, but it was an early and tantalising glimpse of what cutting-edge media technology promised to deliver to American audiences. [Note: Although HD television technology has been in use in other parts of the world for many years, the United States deliberately delayed adopting it for a number of reasons that had more to do with maintenance of existing commercial profit-making paradigms and the existing technology infrastructure than with technological advancement potential. Had American commercial visual media broadcasting companies elected to adopt HD standards when it first became available, HD would have been established in the United States more than a decade and a half ago.]

Zbig Rybczynski, the visionary creator of 'The Orchestra' (and number of equally stunning experimental video pieces) was born in Poland in the year 1949. Although he expressed an early interest in cinema, the main body of his experimental video work did not begin until shortly before 1972, after graduation from the Lodz (Poland) Film School. Ten years of creative work in the film medium by Rybczynski in Communist-controlled Poland ended at about the same time as the declaration of the Polish 'Solidarnosc' (Solidarity) labor union movement came into being ( founded at the Gdansk Shipyard and initially led by Lech Lawensa). Efforts by the Communist Polish government to quash the movement led, as is today well documented, to declarations of martial law (continuing from about 1981 through 1989) and in 1981 Rybczynski fled his native Poland with wife Wanda and a son. Immediately before his departure, he had been a teacher at the Lodenz Film School and had also been active in an avant-garde film group as a cinematographer and directing assistant. Four major film efforts completed during that time included Plamuz ('Music Art', 1983), Zupa ('Soup', 1974), Nowa Ksiqzka ('New Book', 1975), and Tango (1980). It was this last film that gained him a measure of international acclaim, with the subsequent bestowal of an Oscar Award for 'Best Animated Short Subject' in 1983.

In 1990, coincidentally concurrent with the establishment of the Republic of Poland and the election of a free government there, he produced 'The Orchestra'  and was also awarded an Emmy in that year for 'Outstanding Achievement in Special Effects' associated with this film. From that time onward, Rybczynski's creative output has simply escalated, taking form in a number of further creative film efforts of singular uniqueness (they include, in part, 'KAFKA' and 'STEPS'). Rybczynski's academic background includes professorial status at several renown institutions (Columbia University in NYC, the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, Germany, and the Lodz Film School in his native Poland).

After leaving Poland in 1981, he first sought political asylum in Austria, shortly thereafter relocating to New York City and began work for the new MTV music video group, completing over 30 of these music videos between 1984 and 1988. In 1988 his experimental film efforts expanded to include the then new medium of high definition broadcasting technology, using a prototype system pioneered by the SONY Corporation. This led to the 1990 production of his classic 'The Orchestra', as a cooperative effort with New York's WNET (PBS), France's CANAL+, and Japan's NHK Corporation in Tokyo. As mentioned earlier, the original production was first aired in Japan, since HD television would not be available in the US for a number of years to come. The first presentation in the US would take form as part of the PBS 'Great Performances' series of programs (1990), although in standard (non-HD) video broadcast format. As such the PBS version lacks the stunning clarity and brilliance of the HD original, but now that the HD standard has been adopted by the United States' telecommunication broadcast media, Rybczynski's creative masterpiece of classical music, combined with startlingly inspired modern dance and cinematic direction may finally be viewed in its intended form.

As an 'experimental' film, the 57 minutes of 'The Orchestra' are like nothing seen before or after its production. It consists, in the main, of the music of 6 classical era western composers' music (Mozart, Chopin, Albioni, Rossini, Scubert, and Ravel) set to a backdrop panorama of fluidic scenes that together comprise a music-video interpretation of the rise of modern 21st Century civilisation. It has been remarked that this film was specially created, in part, as an intentionally unique expression of the genre for those who appreciate avant-garde experimental film. As I remarked earlier, the film's impact on me was such that I was immediately filled with a sense of speculative and interpretative wonder that I have seldom before experienced. The film was produced at Rybczynski's Hoboken, New Jersey, studio.

Among Rybczynsky's numerous credits are a number of not well known contributions to music-video productions such as those for John Lennon's IMAGINE, and other productions for Mick Jagger, the Alan Parsons Group, Chuck Mangione, Yoko Ono, and many well known names in American pop music. Zbigniew Rybczynski has received a great number of awards and special recognition from all over the world over the past decades and has become particularly noted for his early, pioneering work in computerized high-definition television media and special effects technology. He is presently living in the Los Angeles area of California, engaged in blue and green screen video technology research, and has been said to be working since 2007 on an extensive production in collaboration with Israeli writer and journalist Eli Barbur, tentatively titled `A Short History of White People'.

An internet search for a copy of 'The Orchestra' can often be somewhat  frustrating and unrpoductive; therefore I was personally startled to find three copies of this particular work in DVD format available through AMAZON. I was all set to buy all three of them, figuring their availability to be a fluke, until I stumbled into Mr. Rybczynski's personal internet website where new DVD copies of this film and his other two major works (STEPS and KAFKA) may be acquired directly from him for only US$ 22 each. A special set of all three of these major works (including 'The Orchestra') is available for a flat US$ 60 (my preference). He is apparently no longer producing them, however, so once the remaining supply is gone, there would appear to be no more new copies available.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough, considering it to be both seminal and inspiring for its frank artistic treatment of the ironies and failed promise of Communism and all human attempts to explain existence by means of religious interpretation. You will not be disappointed in this film, even if all you are interested in is an entertaining fifty-seven minute music-video diversion to while extra away hours in the middle of the great Saudi Arabian high desert.

8099705,1,B000CNGC8E,"This film was originally done using High Definition TV technology before HDTV came to the US.  The film was shown in Japanese HDTV broadcast like a decade before HDTV is standardized in the US. Since the original source was done in HD, you would expect a good master when the DVD was produced.  No, you will be totally disappointed.  It looks like they copied a VHS tape onto a disc and then sell it as DVD.

The original film was done in 16:9 aspect ratio.  The producers converted it into letterboxed 4:3 format before making it into DVD.  Almost all modern widescreen DVDs are done to take advantage of widescreen HDTV, not letterbox. If you play this DVD on a HDTV, you have two choices, view the letterbox in pillarbox with black bars all around top bottom left and right.  Or you can zoom the letter box to fill your 16:9 screen.  You get blurred video due to the zoom.  In any case, you don't get the HD imagery this film was originally made in. It simply shows that this director could make movie, but he does not know how to produce a DVD.  He or his producer is totally out of touch with what technology is current in the market.

When this film becomes available in BluRay, wait for reviews before buying one because the producers may not know how to do a BluRay disc properly. A VHS quality BluRay would be a rip-off.  If the original HD source is transferred properly to BluRay, then it would be a nice disc to keep.  How often do you get to see early stage HD technology pioneering works in action?",1260403200,7,1512,4.376344086021505
8099706,5,B000CNGC8E,"I remembered seeing this weird film on public television years ago, and something jogged my memory to make me want to see it again. It took several hours of web surfing to even find out what the film had been that I had seen; finally found it by typing into Google several of the composers and their compositions that are featured in the film. I was quite amazed that it was actually available to purchase. It arrived quickly and exactly as promised (new in original packaging). It is as weird and oddly enjoyable as the first time I saw it.",1257379200,4,541,4.42
8099707,4,B000CNGC8E,"This video is a superb visual accompanied by well played pieces.  However the transfer was not well done.  The original is in high definition widescreen.  The video resolution of the transfer is not much better than standard VHS.  It was probably transferred from broadcast tapes rather than from the original  This could have been transferred with a wide screen option, but instead it is in a cheezy letterboxed format.  The sound is excellent.  In addition it has no chapter markers, so it is difficult or impossible to find sections you would like to replay.

While high definition will give a much better picture, standard DVDs can produce excellent results.  We may have to wait quite a while to see a good resolution version because it may take a while for the format wars to subside, and the price of players come down.

The quality of the video only partly eclipses the poor processing.",1162944000,10,894,4.784313725490196
8099708,5,B000CNGC8E,"Zbigniew Rybczynski started his experimental work with film in 1972, after graduating from the Lodz film school in Poland.  Close to ten years worth of work was created before he emigrated from his native country, in 1981, due to the declaration of Marshall Law by the then-communist government.  By 1984, Rybczynski was living in New York City and making his living directing music videos for the newly established MTV.  Over 30 different music videos were completed by him between the years 1984 and 1988.

In 1988, Mr. Rybczynski started work on his pioneering special-effects productions using SONY's prototype High-Definition Video equipment. This 1990 piece, ""The Orchestra"", was created using High-Def technology in association with WNET, New York, Canal+, Paris, and NHK, Tokyo.  It reflects a maturity of vision that is the result of close to twenty years of work with special effects methodologies.

""The Orchestra"" is a fifty-seven minute ""music video"" that weaves six short pieces by the composers Mozart, Chopin, Albinoni, Rossini, Schubert and Ravel, into a seamless imaginative parable for twenty-first century man.  The work helps to establish a new relationship between sound and moving image, by working to unite the music of the past with the video technology of the future.

Since the art of special effects is unfamiliar to many, this DVD also includes a twenty-five minute ""making of"" documentary by Pierre Oscar Levy. ""The Making of the Orchestra"" introduces us to Rybczynski and his intriguing philosophy of creativity. It also gives us a tour of his Hoboken, New Jersey studio and provides us with generous behind the scenes footage of the actors, dancers and crew at work.

Since interesting visualizations of classical music are indeed rare, ""The Orchestra"" stands out as a special offering to fans of experimental film.  Though the work was produced using High-Definition technology, this standard-definition NTSC DVD will serve as a tantalizing foretaste of the true impact of the piece.

Hopefully, when the High-Definition DVD format wars have finally been won, we will be able to see Mr. Rybczynski's mesmerizing vision as he intended it to be experienced.  Till then, this offering is a welcome one, for those interested in classical music, post-modern dance and the Eastern European creative spirit.",1142899200,31,2333,5.2926829268292686
