6389107,5,B00JQHOB30,"There is no need for a review here. Despite the fury and uproar of society , the spirit constantly changes and adapts, with alarming alacrity. Through the years, our lives and ears change to interpret man's evolution to His creator. But as I watched Charles , I couldn't help but notice his horn as an extension of his soul. Its shape , every part used, nothing is wasted. The deep bell, the clicky register keys, the supple reeds and every picture and influence running through his mind ,concurrently. He brandishes his sax like a fat man, or concealed weapon , or a gazelle. The solidarity of his brothers is always sincere ,and he plays from that sincerity. If you ever loved jazz, this movie will inspire you to hear more of this humble master of saxes and flute. But I feel,that certainly was not the message. The message is the silence between the music.",1409356800,16,860,4.590909090909091

8653294,5,B00JQHOB30,"Arrows Into Infinity is an excellent documentary that looks closely at the musical, personal and spiritual journey of Charles Lloyd, one of the most significant musicians of our time. Co-directed and produced by Lloyd's wife Dorothy Darr the film has an intimacy that is clearly the result of their relationship and her deep knowledge and understanding of the man and his music after a forty year intimate relationship. That she has shaped this knowledge into a formidable film is a testament to her own skills as a filmmaker and artist.

Those who know Lloyd's music and career well will find much to like about this film as it delves deeply into the different stages of his life and music, including the decade between the early 1970s and 1980s in which he stopped performing publicly and disappeared from public view, though he continued to record. If you are interested in a beautifully crafted and intimate look at the life of a most significant artist, you will enjoy this film as well. It is a watershed film in the genre of music documentaries.",1434412800,2,1052,4.8121546961325965
8653295,5,B00JQHOB30,"Very well-done documentary featuring fantastic old footage as well as interviews with critics, sidemen, and Lloyd's take on his career.  This would be of interest to anyone interested in music, and not necessarily Charles Lloyd or jazz.  As a longtime Lloyd devotee (one of my first five jazz albums was Moon Man), I still learned quite a bit about the man and his music.  For fans of Charles Lloyd this is an absolute must own.",1425772800,2,428,4.68

8653297,5,B00JQHOB30,"Great documentary and a magical Jazz legend.  Everything about this video is excellent, exploring history of Charles Lloyd, his influences, the spiritual side of the man, in a very well made film.",1423526400,,196,5.125
8653298,5,B00JQHOB30,"Michael Cuscuna's comment expresses the essential feature of Charles Lloyd's music. His music is always searching, but is really at peace with itself. His music makes us feel much light and compassion. Charles Lloyd speaks to KIyoshi Koyama his unique tender sound comes from Lester Young. Inspired by Coltrane and Rollins, he moved to tenor to step him up more. Since then he continues transmitting energy and joy through his creation. He isn't looking for fame and fortune. He is looking for the zone, the Holy Grail in the music. He realizes there is a great deal of sadness sometimes, but he has a great deal of optimism at the same time. Charles Lloyd thrusts us forward saying the wind of grace are always blowing. We must set our sails high.

""Arrows Into Infinity"" sheds light light on Lloyd's contribution to turbulent decades we lives and his continuing trajectory as a musician. Dorothy Darr edits both archival and contemporary footages and photos into a gentle but soulful 113 minutes film with a warm insider's eye. Interpolated image of sea water and the scenery of the Big Sur suggests saxophonist's origin, who is brought up in the Mississippi River basin, and his resurrection. When he felt becoming a product, he temporally moved back from the music scene. But, Lloyd isn't finished with his explorations. He says, I got off the bus. I became quiet. It's high thinking. It's about elevation. You can't shoot an arrow into infinity if you're always in motion. You have to pull the bow back. Then the arrow can fly.

For Charles Lloyd, it's always the last night of the play. He sings his song in whatever manifestation. You will enjoy a spiritual journey of Charles Lloyd with liquid phrasings and fluid lyricism of his music. You also feel a pleasure to find films and photos from his past album covers.",1418688000,2,1822,4.7993630573248405
