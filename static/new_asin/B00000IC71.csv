1221011,5,B00000IC71,I've been a fan of dragon ball for about 3 years now. there show has heat. We need more dubbed and uncut versions!,913939200,2,114,4.0
1221061,1,B00000IC71,"This makes me laugh. First, because the show is so ungodly terrible, and second because the DVD gives you only the English dubbed censored version. That just makes me crack up, especially since most viewers are ages 6-12 who believe themselves to be cool watching a show that has violence. The funniest thing about it is that some of them are actually under the impression that Dragonball Z is an adult show. Message to any and all children who believe they are watching an adult series: Dragonball Z is not nor has it ever been intended for adults. In Japan it is enjoyed by little children no different than yourselves except that they get to enjoy the completely uncensored versions of these episodes. So if you're upset that they edited all profanity, blood and similar content, don't worry. It's a show for little kids one way or the other.",1035936000,2,845,4.677852348993288
1221062,5,B00000IC71,"This is such a phenomenal anime that has gained popularity since 1996 here in the u.s. but here in America on TV, it has been edited for younger viewers.
Now on DVD, it's fully uncut for your pleasure and in Japanese with subtitles. This show tells the adventures of Goku, a married man with his tough son Gohan with friends who seek out to find the mystical Dragonballs from tons of powerful enemies.
An awesome show with lots of spectacular fight scenes and good animation, one of the best anime shows with Sailor Moon, Tenchi Muyo, Digimon, Transformers, Ranma 1/2, Outlaw Star, and Samaurai Pizza Cats. Plus there is a ton of hotties on this show including the green haired beauty "" Bulma"", she is every animation lover's dream come true.",1035849600,,742,4.67175572519084
1221063,3,B00000IC71,"Goku introduces his co-star for Dragonball Z, his son Gohan.  Gohan is named after Goku's grandfather, who you saw in the last few episodes of Dragonball.  Throughout DBZ you'll find Goku and Gohan stealing the show from each other.  Goku goes to rescue Gohan, and Gohan beats the bad guy.  Gohan is in trouble and Goku shows up to save him.  You'll see this happen a time or two per season.
The reunion between the friends is a bit anti-climactic, but the pace quickly picks up when Goku's brother is introduced as well!  Piccolo joins the party, and you just get swept away in the story.
This is horrible in english.  This is not because I like hearing Japanese or reading subtitles; it is because the dialog is beyond bad.  The fact that this is edited for children is even worse.  Do they not realize that the subject matter in Dragonball and Dragonball Z is for adults?  Goku pulls Bulma's underwear off, Bulma flashes the turtle hermit to acquire his dragonball...  Apparently marketing this dumbed-down adult show towards children has paid off.  Funimation is rolling in money!  True fans don't appreciate the lack of support.  Imagine reading your favorite book - paraphrased for the kids!  Yuck!",1024099200,3,1204,4.776699029126213

If your a fan of english dbz , no hard feelings , buy the vhs version it is cheaper and the same thing . This dvd has 4 episodes . The first episode is really two epps .

This is where they are introduced to Gohan, the son of Goku.  Goku's long lost brother shows up shortly after and ruins the party.  I would advise anyone who has been following the story on TV to pick up this dvd to see where everything started from.  My only complaint about it would be that the little Gohan can be a little too whiny and annoying at times.  Overall a great purchase!",1018742400,,558,4.3173076923076925

Fact is, I found the first 4 episodes very interesting and entertaining. Here, we most importantly come to know of Goku's origins; hence explaining in full many gaps found in the first Db series (Goku's tail and his transformation into Oozaru to mention one). Goku and Piccolo joining allies in order to defeat the enemy was also a really cool idea. Overall, the first 4 episodes are a must have for every Dragonball fan.",1015027200,,539,4.74468085106383

Great starting point for someone who is not familar with DBZ.  My sister never watched it before, and when watching this first DVD, she was instantly hooked.

If you think this series is going to be similar to the comical Dragonball, your in for a surprise. Goku is grown up to an adult and married to Chi Chi. He has a son named Gohan who is about 4 years old. Bulma has matured in to an adult. Krillin has grew, but not that tall. Yamcha hasn't changed much and neither has Master Roshi. Sadly, Launch is not included in this series. Would have made some good comedy moments. It starts out with a spaceship landing on Earth. A new enemy named Raditz emerges. Raditz soon reveals to Goku that Goku is a legendary warrior of the Sayians. Raditz kidnapps Gohan, Goku's son, and won't give him back until he is fought. Piccolo decides to team up with Goku in a furious brawl against Raditz. And it does not turn out the way you would expect it to.
The action on this disc is extremely cool, even for the first four episodes. It is still rather a dissapointment that there is no Japanese dialogue, but it's still a good disc. Worth watching for long time DBZ fans and newcomers alike.",1006300800,,1275,4.452991452991453
1221090,5,B00000IC71,"Hey everyone! I recently got hooked on Dragon BallZ and Tenchi from cartoon network.  I tell you what, this is one of the best set of episodes made by Dragon Ball-Z. It is the beginning first 4 episodes of Dragon Ball-Z where Goku the main character fights his evil brother Raditz. To all who have never seen this and are kind of puzzled about buying it because of the editing done when the episode appeared in the U.S., don't worry. You are not missing a heck of a lot. I have seen the original version in Japanese and it is not all that important.  The scenes lost are usually unimportant and are often sick minded if you are a parent , concerned about what your kid watches.  But, don't worry these episodes are awesome.  Hey im 20 years old and I can't get enough of Dragon Ball Z and Tenchi, and yes i have a life.  Anyways buy it you won't regret it.

Unfortunatly, this DVD doesn't have  subtitles nor is Closed Captioned, but the english dub works well. A Nice  plus about the DVD is that it also gives you the previews for all of the  Episodes on the Next DVD.

I purchased this primarily out of nostalgia, and it does serve that purpose.  The reason for the average rating is because the quality of the video is analagous to that of what you would get if you recorded it on a VHS off of TV.

7910159,3,B00000IC71,"I know there are a lot of people who prefer reviews to be short and to-the-point, while there is another set that prefer a larger, more elaborate explanation. So, in the interest of doing that, I'll provide both a short review and a long review. I'll also include a ""What You Should Buy Instead"" section at the end.

SHORT REVIEW: This DVD only contains the edited English dub as it first aired on TV back in 1996 with the original Ocean Studios voice cast. Unless you understand that last sentence, you probably don't want to get this.

LONG REVIEW: Dragon Ball Z has a very long, complex, and complicated history in the English-speaking world (which includes the U.S., Canada, the U.K., New Zealand, and Australia). The English dub was one of the first foreign language dubs of this anime(the first being the European French dub), and our dub has gone through a roller-coaster of changes. When DBZ first started out in 1996, it was being handled jointly by FUNimation Entertainment (then called FUNimation Productions) and Saban Entertainment (the people responsible for ""Power Rangers""). Saban determined that if DBZ was ever going to be successful in the English-speaking world, they had to make a lot of changes and edits to the series in order for it to be a family-friendly show. For those of you who don't know, Dragon Ball Z originated as a show in Japan and, while kid-friendly by Japanese standards, it had a lot of scenes that most modern English-speaking people would find objectionable. There's a lot of violence, blood, some cursing, and a little bit of small-scale nudity (although the nudity was always used for comedic effect). Saban basically said that unless these were changed, the show would never see the light of day in the English-speaking world.

So, DBZ began in 1996 using a voice cast based in Ocean Studios in Vancouver, Canada, then led by voice actor Ian James Corlett as the voice of the main character Goku. The show was, in accordance with Saban's demands, very heavily edited. Blood was digitally painted out, overly violent scenes were cut, objectionable sound effects such as gun shots were changed, and the entire original orchestral score by Shunsuke Kikuchi was replaced by an electronic score by Shuki Levi (the guy who does the music for Power Rangers). The changing of the music was one of the more controversial aspects given that of all the other foreign-language dubs that came before and after, the English dub was the ONLY dub to replace the music. Perhaps most controversially, however, the English scripts were toned down in intensity to be more kid-friendly, with then-producer Barry Watson admitting in an interview that they had a writer whose job it was to ""punch up the comedy"" of the scripts. These script changes also changed certain Japanese terms such as the names of places, characters, and attacks. It was not completely rewritten, but it was rewritten significantly enough that many people who were already familiar with the changes found them infuriating.

That's the dub that's on this DVD. The first three episodes of it, anyway.

Over the years, though, Saban lost interest in DBZ and FUNimation took this as an opportunity to make more of their own creative decisions with the series. Starting in 1999, they began offering uncut DVDs with two different audio channels--an ""uncut"" English dub and the original Japanese audio track with professionally-translated English subtitles. This new English dub featured a new voice cast based in Dallas, Texas, led by voice actor Sean Schemmel as the voice of Goku. You may have noticed, though, that I put the word uncut in quotation marks. That's not an error. While this new dub was uncut visually on the DVDs, that was about it. The orchestral score by Kikuchi was again replaced with an electronic score by Bruce Faulconer, and the scripts were still significantly toned down, with some people arguing that they were actually even worse than before. It basically went from a corny, edited dub to a corny dub with blood. Furthermore, although the visual edits were no longer in place for the uncut DVDs, the edits still continued for the show's airing on Cartoon Network (although there was not quite as much of it as before due to different network restrictions).

I wrote that last paragraph only to give people an idea of what they should expect when they get this DVD, and differentiate it for newer fans of DBZ who might be a little confused. If you grew up with the English dub voices of Sean Schemmel, Chris Sabat, Sonny Strait, and Stephanie Nadolny, that version is NOT on here. The version on this DVD only has the edited English dub with the Ocean Studios voice cast of Ian James Corlett, Scott McNeil, Brian Drummond, Terry Klassen, and Saffron Henderson. The music here is also Shuki Levi's music and not Bruce Faulconer's. I'm only interested in getting this DVD as a nostalgic item, because this is the dub I started out with and I thought it might be fun to revisit the old days.

WHAT YOU SHOULD BUY: That depends on what kind of fan you are. Kind of a cop-out answer, but it's the truth. So I've broken it down for you.

If you want the ""uncut"" English dub of DBZ with Bruce Faulconer's music, you want.......the ""orange brick"" Season Box Sets. They're cheap and the whole series has been released that way. Kikuchi's music is actually available on these DVD box sets as well, along with Bruce Faulconer's music and the original Japanese audio track, but the video quality is not that great because the ""remastering"" process that FUNimation put DBZ through for these box sets is lackluster at best.

If you want the ""uncut"" English dub of DBZ with Shunsuke Kikuchi's music, you want......the ""Dragon Boxes,"" which are still being released. The video quality and audio quality of these sets are BEAUTIFUL, because they were remastered frame-by-frame by Toei Animation itself. Bruce Faulconer's music is nowhere to be found on these sets though, if that matters to you.

If you want the uncut original Japanese version of DBZ, you want.....the ""Dragon Boxes."" The Dragon Boxes also have the option of the Japanese audio track, but unlike the orange brick Season Box Sets, both the audio and the video look absolutley beautiful here.

If you want a wonderful, truly uncut English dub of DBZ, you want.....the DVD (or Blu-Ray) box sets for Dragon Ball Z Kai. Kai is a whole different matter in and of itself, and I don't want to put too much down here to confuse people, so I'll keep this short. The dub for Dragon Ball Z Kai is absolutley WONDERFUL. The scripts are fantastically loyal. Japanese attack names are retained, swear words are retained, and the original dialogue is maintained. The music is also the original music for the show by newcomer Kenji Yamamoto. As far as loyalty is concerned, this is how DBZ should have been dubbed in the first place. Please note that the DVD and Blu-Ray box sets for this show are uncut--the version of DBZ Kai that you are watching on Nicktoons and the CW4Kids is, like DBZ was with Toonami, edited for content. So all of the people complaining about the lack of blood and violence in that show are clearly unaware that uncut DVD and Blu-Ray box sets for this show have been released. It's also got the FUNimation voice cast that started in 1999 (with one or two recasts). THIS is how DBZ should have been dubbed.

I certainly hope that helps!",1284940800,25,7414,4.801724137931035
