If you like to pump up your ego and challenge your perception and your left and right brain arrangement-- by all means try this film. The analogies are quite simple. But, there are some which I realized after watching a few more times. Appreciation of life, gaudy provincial governors, power and control, imaginative legends of a few thousand years ago (actual historical legend). People who are down and out of money need only friendship and a little bit of assistance is one of the analogies used, but only once. The rustic 8MM Film makes use of the non pure qualities that analog exhibited. I'm not a particular fan of analog but the higher quality digital tools are quite expensive. This film captures the relative consequences of a greedy, patriarchal influenced, and menial population. The brisk vastness of non populated areas of the Armenian or Persian landscape are reason enough to purchase the film. If you wait or fast forward the movie to almost when the ending credits are finishing, you will get a special features section. At least in the version of Ashuk Kerib Russian Version only.",1268006400,,1210,4.878640776699029
2098450,5,B0002HCHU2,"Now I know there are too many reviews on Amazon that give 5 stars to every worthless item like your favorite sci-fi book the one you read in 3rd grade with the neat kinds of invading alien vehicles years later you discovered was copped right out of H.G. Wells . . . but sincerely, REALLY, this is a film unlike any you have seen before or since.... I first saw the beginning 15 minutes of this film in art school stupidly high after lunch break and was completely blown away. Most of the shots have this uniquely flat compostion to them which combined with the colorful costumes and general extravagance in everything make this less of a movie than a puppetshow or moving painting. And so much of the effect would be less without the incredible music . . . it is almost like watching a silent movie there is so little dialogue.  --Of course my teacher only had the KINO copy, which if you read the reviews for their version you will get an idea how bad it is. Well, let me tell you, the difference cannot be overstated. Here I have finally gotten a hold of the RUSICO DVD and it is everything I hoped it would be. First of all, you now actually have the option of subtitles. And the colors before were so basic everything was in primaries -- now the picture is so much more intricate and detailed. My only complaint is to the Special Features, where the documentary on Paradzhanov (the director) lacks the option of English. But the film is even more fantastic than ever. I can't begin to single out one favorite scene. The part where Kerib's mother thinks he is dead and goes blind, and the camera moves back until it rustles the bushes is just as fine choreography as Fellini or Tarkovsky, who are much better known. But then, nearly every shot is literally ""picture-perfect"", -- as I said, every frame worthy of a painting. The part where Kerib faces the strange tiger with the spinning head . . . is surprising, funny, disturbing, surreal, all at the same time, -- perfection. All this is not to give the impression this is a ""highbrow"", utterly inaccessible film either. There's nothing intellectual or aloof about this, -- in fact I'd try to summarize by calling it eye-candy without the guilt.",1146700800,9,2200,4.513784461152882
2098451,5,B0002HCHU2,"Visually, this is the most stunning film I have seen. It conflates the art of narrative and the art of the tableau--like the friezes Keats describes in ""Ode on a Grecian Urn."" Of course, the figures move--the  subject is a romance, a quest. But the plot seems less important than the  lyricism--a lyricism which includes, and yet extends beyond the visual. One  feels the heartbreaking love of the director for a world half imagined,  half real. The real basis of the world portrayed was largely destroyed by  the Soviet Regime (and the general march of modernity). This too is  present--a portion of the mysterious emotional impact. ""Ashik  Kerib"" is an Oriental fairy tale, an esoteric protest, a song, a  poem--an unforgettable work of art.",951609600,9,743,4.935483870967742
8027996,4,B0002HCHU2,"Here's something I have definitely never seen before ... a film adapted from Azerbaijan folklore.  Ashik Kerib is a troubadour who falls in love with Magul-Megeri.  His offer of marriage is rejected by her father because Ashik has no money.  Ashik vows to wander for 1000 days to make enough money and come back to marry ... she agrees to wait.  However, a rival fakes Ashik's death, hoping to get Magul-Megeri to marry him.  No dice ... she vows to mourn 1000 days.  Oh, and Ashik's mother goes blind.  Meanwhile Ashik wanders and encounters a variety of strange people and circumstances.  This is a visually stunning film that will probably offer a steep curve to many viewers since the story is told in a deliberately exaggerated style with a lot of singing, dancing and very very broad acting.  I loved it.  Any movie that features an emu kicking a pomegranate around in the corner of one scene is fine by me. The film is dedicated to the memory of Andrei Tarkovsky.",1484870400,,970,4.619883040935672
8027997,3,B0002HCHU2,A very strange movie. Disjointed and not beautifully photographed as advertised. Ok for late night view.,1458000000,,104,5.5625
8027998,4,B0002HCHU2,Interesting!,1446422400,,12,12.0
8027999,5,B0002HCHU2,impossible to find words. this movie speaks for itself,1444348800,,54,5.111111111111111
8028000,5,B0002HCHU2,"An visual feast.  The man is beyond all the famous names in the West (Pasolini, Cocteau, Fellini, Antonioni or Brackage).  This is my all time favorite and video quality in amazon's streaming was pretty good too.  Don't try too hard to understand the film, take it easy while watching it.  It is a series of vignettes.",1433030400,,318,4.625
8028001,5,B0002HCHU2,It is so beautiful! I loved it!,1428537600,,31,3.5714285714285716
8028002,4,B0002HCHU2,"Colors, costuming and music were
amazing. The acting seemed off,
almost a caricature. Perhaps this
was intentional. However, despite
these limitations, this is an extremely
important piece of experimental film
history. Parajanov should be honored
for the risks he took both creatively and
politically, which resulted in his being jailed
by the soviets.",1401321600,,352,5.660377358490566
8028003,4,B0002HCHU2,"First off, the film is not Russian. It was produced in Soviet occupied Georgia by an Armenian filmmaker. The language is primarily Georgian with some Azeri. As others have noted, this isn't a linear story and is not your regular entertainment. It's basically short segments drawn from ancient history played out with some dancing and music. You will know by 15 minutes in whether or not this is for you....",1396656000,3,406,4.814285714285714
8028004,4,B0002HCHU2,"OK I admit it, I think that I enjoyed this weird thing.
What the heck it was? I'm really not sure.
They had me at the emu in the corner knocking pomegranates around on the floor.
This was visually mesmerizing and compelling thing. I think there was a plot. I'm not sure if it was
a parody or if it was serious. Sometimes I had to force myself to keep watching it.
BUT, it sure took my attention away from everyday life as I know it.
I'll probably have to watch this thing a few more times. There's a story in there somewhere I know it.
I mean no offense to anybody, but after watching this I feel like I just returned home from another planet.
Which is kinda cool because no matter what, this flick is, imo,  entertaining..
Weird is OK sometimes..",1393632000,,747,4.223776223776224
8028005,2,B0002HCHU2,.... but not really tenable as a work of entertainment.  We watched this for 20 minutes or so and we laughed but it was... pretty unwatchable.  Others may have better results and I wanted to like it but it just ... wasn't.  So sad.,1391212800,2,231,4.204545454545454
