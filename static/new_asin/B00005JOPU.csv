RELEASE IT ON DVD!!!!",1485820800,,120,4.95
7942058,5,B00005JOPU,"I've never forgotten the laughs from this 1984 Lorne Michaels ""The New Show,"" that was much like SNL but in primetime, and consistently funny.  GREAT sketch comedy, musical guests and retro-America graphics.  I especially loved ""The Frightened Family,"" with John Candy, Steve Martin's Billie Jean Video spoof, Roy's Food Repair (John Candy w/Paul Simon!) and...The Naughty Lady with the Quaid brothers.

7942059,5,B00005JOPU,"This was one of the best new comedies of 1984.  I still can't believe it was not continued.  From Steve Martin's excellent sendup of Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" to John Candy in ""Roy's Food Repair"" to the ""Frightened Family.""  This should be a cult classic except nobody seems to know about it.  A ""cryan' shame!""",1196899200,3,313,4.636363636363637
