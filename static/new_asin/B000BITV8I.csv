8087209,2,B000BITV8I,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now.  They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it.  However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors.  Also the sound is very bad.  Some of the plots are a little boring.  But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality.  I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't.  I just wish it was easier to watch.",1169337600,,505,4.040404040404041
8087210,5,B000BITV8I,"I purchased from Amazon.co.uk each of the four seasons of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" - all 143 episodes - for about $20 per season.

Digital transfer was excellent and our entire family has enjoyed the series. Packaging involved sturdy plastic cases, each containing 2 DVD's, with 8 episodes per disk. I found this a great value and wanted to recommend it to others interested in the Robin Hood series.",1147219200,5,406,4.8
8087211,4,B000BITV8I,"4 More episodes of that first rate 50's TV show from England.  This DVD gets less stars for three reasons:

The Frightened Tailor:  One of the lower quality episodes of the series concerning a list of those loyal to King Richard.

Too Many Earls:  One of the silliest episodes of the series and that isn't said in a happy way concerning a fanatical nature lover and a land dispute.

The third reason is the three of the 4 episodes on this DVD have been available in other formats.  Most of the other DVD in this series contained at least 2-3 shows that I had not seen since they were on TV, but when I purchased this one I only got one new  show.  THE PATH OF TRUE LOVE, an interesting yarn about trouble at Robin Hood's old estate.

The final episode THE MAY QUEEN is a first rate story about an attempt to swindle a young Lord out of his estate after the death of his father.  This is certainly an episode that you will enjoy again and again.

Although the number of quality episodes is low you do need it to complete the set and unlike a VHS where I had to either sit through TOO MANY EARLS to get to the better ones you can select a chapter so it is still worth having.",1144022400,,1173,4.1415929203539825
