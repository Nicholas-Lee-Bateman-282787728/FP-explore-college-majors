8408092,2,B003XFOOJC,"First, I found this drama very dated.  I've seen several Kdramas from this time but this one shows its age.  As for the story, I was initially drawn in to the first few episodes but after a while the story got very drawn out.  I think it could have definately been better if it wasn't so long.  I did like the adorable ""gangster"".  He totally stole my heart!  Now, the description of this product refers to a gripping ending.  Ah...the ending!  If I could I would add a spoiler here but I won't ruin it for those who want to be surprised.  All I can say is, didn't like it!!!!!  It wasn't because of what happened, necessarily, but because I didn't like the female lead's reasons for doing what she did.  Anyway, after watching I felt as if I wasted my time.",1352160000,,758,4.267605633802817

The subtitles are good, very few mistakes anywhere and the condition of the disks was great.",1338768000,2,240,4.714285714285714
