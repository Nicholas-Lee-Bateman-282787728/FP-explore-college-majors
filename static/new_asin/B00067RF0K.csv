As with so many of the adventures of Doctor Black Jack the unlicensed surgeon, this is an extreme case... A very well-told story.",1475539200,,400,5.1692307692307695
8039863,5,B00067RF0K,"Because I've purchased all of the Black Jack anime that one can get their hands on I cannot write a review for all of them.  Overall I am very pleased with every title; all of them arrived well packaged, no scratches or shipping problems, exactly as described.  The stories I've watched several times an love them each time.  The impact of multiple genres inside the Black Jack titles is a great mix of horror, drama, comedy, suspense and more - each with their own storyline, well followed and ending perfectly.  Not a lot of ""left in the dark"" from the ""BJ"" series / OVAs, etc.  Highly recommended to any anime watcher, though most I believe should be over 13 at least.",1370563200,,671,4.512396694214876
8039864,4,B00067RF0K,"This is a very exciting episode of Black Jack.  The face-shaped carbuncle is a pretty interesting problem, but it is also one of the things that makes this different from most of the rest of the series.  The first half of the series is very believable, but there is no way this could ever happen.  A tumor that has a face and can think, talk, and move loses that feel of reality.",1112745600,,379,4.236111111111111
