It is particulary funny if you've ever been privy to those (arts related persons) with  inflated self-worth or self-esteem.  One of my favorite visual parts is  during the group softball game when you get a look at the makeshift  uniforms the arts community has come up with-- I guarantee you won't be  able to stop laughing during parts of this scene... Also, Bernadette  Peters' Broadway acting legacy shines throughout the flick. I'm about to  sound like an Imposters perfume box, but....

334037,2,6301415841,"As I understand it, ""Slaves Of New York"" is based on a series of short stories, with Bernadette Peter's character having the task of sewing it all together.  It's no small coincidence that her character can't sew well.  The basic premise of the film is that he who has the lease owns the people who come to live with him.  It sounds like a line out of ""Dune"" but soon reveals itself to be a way the characters rationalize their weak behavior;  they can't afford a place on their own, so in one way or another they prostitute themselves to someone who has a place, be it as a friend or lover, or..., and having to put up with that person's bad behavior and maltreatment of them, they refer to themselves as slaves.  Not quite the same thing, but let's keep moving.

While this may very well be based on short stories, it comes across more as an idea hatched over dinner, where Mess'rs  Merchant and Ivory and friends all recounted their experiences in New York, in the 80's and someone said ""That would make a great movie!""  which might be true, but not by Merchant Ivory.  It's something of a relationship movie, running beneath a collection of period images;  images that for no good reason show up on multiple screens (long before the computer made that common place) and occasionally as an overlap.  The movie wants to look artsy, but it isn't.

One of the main problems is the choice of Bernadette Peters as the lead character, a young hat designer who's sharing the flat of a selfish, domineering, and manipulative male artist of some local note.  Ms. Peters is a one note actress, whose performance hovers between stressed and melt down;  suggesting a character in an Woody Allen movie, except that she can't even convincingly evoke a neuroses well enough for that.  When she achieves her first flash of success, and gets her own place, her ""boyfriend"", comes back to ""let her make up with him""  for their break up, and in a scene that lasts only a couple of minutes, the best she can manage is ""You're a Jerk!"".  We knew that, but that's all you can say?

Merchant Ivory was a film company that not only produced a number of classic films, but became a title for a genre of films; the lush productions of costume dramas set mostly in Britain or the US a century or so ago.  To that end, while this was filmed as a contemporary piece, enough time has passed to see it as a period film, and the costumes, especially those worn by Ms. Peters, evoke a truncated, punkish interpretation of the Edwardian costumes in their bigger films.  Also of anthropological interest is the hair.  Oh my!  ""Big Hair"" doesn't quite do it justice, this 1980's penchant of the indigenous tribeswomen of the NYC/NJ area for overwrought, massive hair-do's.  ""White woman's 'fro"" would be one suggestion, but the construction of these monuments to bad taste are far more contrived than organic.  Not since the Sun Kings partied at Versailles has women's hair looked this ridiculous.  The hair in this film makes even the period 'dos of ""Moonstruck"" look conservative.

I read that this has become a cult film in the Gay Community, for the scene of the drag queens playing the Supremes, which I must admit is a rather memorable scene, especially as it interplays with a messy argument between Ms. Peter's character and her ""boyfriend"".

Still, unless you came of age in the '80s, and can't leave it behind, or have an inexplicable attraction for the period, the way I did, back then, for the '30s and '40s, I can't see wasting the time on this unfortunate film.

If, on the other hand, you've recently watched ""Take This Waltz"" and ""Tiny Furniture"", two films of adult children struggling in the Real World, this might be a worthy piece to add to your study.  It is interesting to note how childish, ""Childishness"" has become since the 1980's!",1363132800,3,3824,4.615384615384615

I used to have this film, ""Slaves of New York""  in VHS and lost it.  My sister reminded me of it again, so I got it in  DVD.  It is darn quirky and fun and it feels inspiring to me.

334039,3,6301415841,"Slaves Of New Yotk is based upon the book of the same name by Tama Janowitz, who is also in the movie as Elenore's friend, Abby. This book would have been hard to film since it was a collection of short stories Janowitz wrote for Interview magazine at Warhol's request. In my honest opinion Merchant Ivory pulled it off, theone whoare famous for Edwardian dramas, this could be in fact an Edwardian type of drama. I do like the soap opera style, the 60's split screen style when it goes from one storyline to the other, the music(love the music!), and ths is also Steve Buscemi's film debut as an homage to clothing designer Stephen Sprouse(who also designed much of the outfits in the movie). This movie was released druing my senior year in art school, a bunch of us in theater, music and art departments went to a midnight showing(after the theater closed) to see it. One of the group members had an uncle who owned a theater, so he would do this for her, also got to see Fatal Attraction and Hairspray that way. My only disappointment is with the soundtrack, two songs are not included, Joe Leeway's, and say Hello To Your Man(the performance artist's song) is not included.
SO....having said all thqat, do I reccomend this movie, yes quite simply, for the reason that is takes a book of seperate unrelated stories in a book where the characters do not cross each others paths to a soap opera style of film making. And then makes it appealing to the eye as a music video.",1301270400,,1475,4.507462686567164

334061,5,6301415841,"Since 1989, this quirky and original little movie amused me and fed my inner Bohemian.

334062,1,6301415841,"This film with it's enormous cast of talented actors portraying and poking fun at the Bohemian life of artists and their world in 1980's New York City is a totally not-funny, misdirected dull and completely annoying piece of pretentious story telling. It is a total waste of 125 minutes of life. Perhaps in the hands of Robert Altman, this film might have moved cleverly,but James Ivory is totally out of his or any element trying to make this film breathe with any form of artistic life or sensibility. This film fails as a comedy, a drama AND as a stinging indictment on the artistic world and it's view on relationships . The sight gags fall flat. The characters  go no where as they drift along from person to person and place to place in the concrete jungle where life is cold and heartless for the starving artist. Even Eleanor,(Peters), in her attempt to get a life and have a fulfilling relationship is bogged down and unsympathetic in it's portrayal.  This film has no soul whatsoever and trying to find anyone with which this artist/musician could identify was impossible. Bernadette Peters' genius is wasted. Actors such as Chris Sarandon,Stanley Tucci,Mercedes Ruehl and Steve Buscemi are total throwaways in this avant-garde portrayal of social climbers and pretentious self-seekers in New York. We are left with one conclusion: relationships probably are not ever going to be what you want or need them to be! Sorry...but I don't agree with that conclusion no matter how great or bad a film is. I understand what Tama Janowitz the author is attempting to convey, but James Ivory did not do it for her material in my opinion. Her work is hip and intellectual. This film is not.

SEX IN THE CITY ,COMPANY and even RENT are far more effective and interesting in portraying the craziness and supposed cold-fishiness of New York.",1182988800,5,1838,4.828571428571428

334064,5,6301415841,"I first saw Slaves of New York when it was originally released quite some time after reading the book. I was drawn into the world of the 80's NYC Art Scene. The film is a bit austere, but I think that helps viewer's relate to Eleanor's (Bernadette Peters)struggle in life as an outsider-that she never gets the joke. Bernadette gives a rich and nuanced performance as Eleanor. She is the reason for seeing the film. She vacillates between giddy joy, depression, heartbreak, and triumph. Her introverted Eleanor is a joy to watch.

The colorful peripheral characters add spice and contrast, but it is Eleanor's story of finding her identity in an environment where everything is a facade.

This film is definitely not for everyone. Many talented people worked on this film and I found it charming on so many levels. It is definately unlike anything you have ever seen. If you love anything about the 80's culture, fashion, or pop world this is a must see. The fashion alone is a hoot. There are several priceless scenes.",1126137600,14,1019,4.751412429378531
334065,2,6301415841,"Hopelessly stiff in some parts, and unfunny in others, ""Slaves of New York"" doesn't have any center. James Ivory was perhaps a poor choice as a director;  there is a restrained quality to the movie and nothing seems spontaneous.  Ivory seemed to be trying for his own Altmanesque collage; the truth is, Altman should have been the one to direct this in the first place.

The casting isn't much better: Bernadette Peters does what she can with the role of Eleanor but she's too old for the part.  Mercedes Ruehl is barely believable as an East Village bohemian;  she looks as though she's playacting.  Adam Coleman Howard is more whiny than anything as Stash and Nick Corri's character, while likeable, lacks the bite of the character in the original stories.

The one scene that really stands out is the three cross dressers lip synching to the Supremes' ""Love is Like an Itchin' in my Heart"" on the street at 6 a.m. That's a fantastic moment and one that really gives the movie any life, and will perhaps be the ticket to the movie not being forgotten entirely.

The extras are bittersweet. The late Ismail Merchant is interviewed, looking fit and healthy, and an unsmiling Tama Janowitz discusses the transition from book to film.  Bernadette Peters looks exactly the same as she always has.",1124236800,12,1293,4.762331838565022
334066,5,6301415841,"I have to admit. This is the movie that made me want to drop everything and move to NYC to become an artist/writer/hat designer/club kid. Of course, I was 16 when I first saw it and wasn't going to be leaving my Colorado suburban abode anytime soon. But it still inspired me to one day visit NYC and run into the same characters in this movie. Not only is the story entertaining, but the movie style is indeed unique.
My only request: PLEASE MAKE THIS AVAILABLE ON DVD!
I would love to see bonus DVD material including a documentary on NYC in the '80s and commentary with the director and Bernadette Peters. Maybe Criterion will take this one on.

334068,3,6301415841,"Big hair, loud colours, 80's music, and funky hats. Slaves To New York captures the essence of the eighties in a New York party circuit kind of way. I marveled more at the clothes and the hair, and turned a deaf ear at  the soap opera that was unravelling before my eyes. Watching all those  artists play bed tag with eachother didn't seem to phase me. It's all so  passe in the art world.
I loved Bernadette Peters and her constant array  of feathered and bowed hats, and the film did supply some awe inspiring  shots of New York city skyline. Steve Buscemi provides a cameo as a fashion  designer, that was kind of interesting.  But like i said before, the hats  took center stage in this spectacle.

7812589,5,6301415841,"More than 27 years now, this small, iconic film still dazzles and resonates with Manhattanites everywhere. Released during one of the most acclaimed periods of film-making, Slaves of New York captured what was the bold truth of 1989's colorful, downtown social scene, combined with witty writing and edgy imagery. Tama Janowitz's observation about the city's real estate market, narcissistic artist class, and ruthless social scene were fresh then and, due to modern day gentrification, have become far-flung, telescopic memories of days gone by. If Slaves of New York does seem a little faded, it's not because it's become dated but because it's become timeless!

Eleanor (Bernadette Peters), an inspiring hat designer, strives to live the mid-class life in what is known as the ""homeless"" privileged class of lower Manhattan. Scratching and clawing to survive in the Big Apple almost seems like an unrealistic concept for a woman who constantly wears her heart on her sleeve, but Eleanor greets each day with her head held high and her pet Dalmatian at her side. Bernadette Peters gives a heartfelt performance, full of joy and bubbling with excitement! Granted, her character has an abundance of insecurities and often feels unsure about the trials of life, but these issues slowly fade once she discovers her own identity and breaks free from the mental abuse inflicted by her roommate, Stash! An independent artist in downtown NYC, Stash resides in a high-rise loft, where he shares living quarters with Eleanor and takes her on one hell of an emotional roller coaster ride! I say this with extreme conviction: the character, Stash, literally makes my skin crawl! This man is a monster! I find myself uncomfortable as I watch his performance and, quite frankly, it shocks me to witness such self-centered, narcissistic behavior; foul behavior that mutates from beginning to end! Every spoken word, every sneaky step, his rancid attitude and lack of compassion are all too much to register. Stash's friend/new lover, Daria, is what many people would consider to be a heartless maneater! In fact, she was a slithering snake who cheated death during what I like to call: the ""Ladder"" scene! I am familiar with every aspect of downtown NYC and I've closely examined every second of this scene, so I can say with certainty that if she fell backwards off the escape ladder, in the air, as high up as she was, then she would have just missed the pile of garbage that sat directly under the ladder and would have died instantly from the impact to the concrete! Both Stash and Daria carry themselves with zero respect and hold little to absolutely no accountability for their self-loathing, self-destructive behavior. It's one thing to behave recklessly toward each other, but when you make it a personal crusade to destroy the lives of your dear friends, companions and acquaintances, well, there's just only so much that a human being can take until they explode! What I find most distasteful is the fact that Daria has chosen to finagle her way into the lives of 2 close friends, only to belittle and undermine another female, then completely phase her out. Certainly sisterhood should have prevailed. I guess it just goes to shows that when it comes to rivalry, we women can be more brutal than men. Not only are Stash and Daria selfish and vicious, but each feed off of the other's negative energy like a pair of slimy leaches; the two absolutely deserve each other! The climax is quite exhilarating and occurs during the fashion show, when Stash discovers Eleanor on the runway as she's greeted for her work by Wilfredo. That moment was, in my opinion, the bitchslap that Stash desperately needed all along. The pain and heartache endured from her recent past becomes a mere memory now because she's finally made a name for herself and, in her words, is ""busy celebrating being single and successful.""

In film, progression is inevitable, and fashion comes and goes with the blink of an eye. So when it comes to retro vs modern cinema, the one thing that I really enjoy is watching the evolution of my favorite actors and actresses, from one movie to the next. This dynamic comedy has a few of my faves as well, including Nick Corri (Jsu Garcia) who plays Marley, a struggling artist/painter, with aspirations of fame and wealth, as well as the hope of securing a grant to build his artistic chapel in Rome. His good friend, Sherman (Charles McCaughan), also paints and values his friendship with Marley. Both characters maintain a solid relationship, even after Marley sleeps with his girlfriend, Daria. I am a fan of Nick Corri, so I'm aware of his work and his appearance in this project is most prominent: tall, tanned-skinned, with beautiful long black hair...aaahhh! Steve Buscemi has a great deal of appeal as Wilfredo Sylvain, a designer/big time buyer who runs his very own clothing shop in midtown Manhattan. Wil is a laid back, consummate professional with fashions that run the gamut from leather jackets to aquatic-themed fur coats. He serves somewhat as a savior to Eleanor in the sense that he simply discovers her and shapes her future. I'm in complete awe of Steve's performance and I can't imagine this film without his presence! Chris Sarandon is the suave, slick, handsome Victor Okrent, a no-nonsense art promoter, who operates his own art gallery and often clashes with the childlike attitude of Stash and his lack of principles and respect. Samantha (Mercedes Ruehl) and Darryl (Stanley Tucci) are lovers and soon-to-be expectant parents. Sam is a recovering drug addict and has been clean for 2 months but, at the neighborhood softball game, she reveals to Eleanor that she's relapsed and has recently contacted her dealer. She also reveals that she's pregnant. Yes, this film is a situated comedy with its fair share of reality, but I think that the portrayal of a newly pregnant, drug-addicted ""party girl"" was awfully gutsy for its time, not to mention a real tragedy! Of course this does not affect my appreciation for the actress herself. Mercedes Ruehl won me over in 'Gia' and stole my heart in the 'Gwen Arajo' story. My loyalty to her as an actress was established years ago and is firmly set in stone. Jan (Michael Schoeffling) is Eleanor's new love interest and shows up at approximately 15 minutes toward the end of the film, but he makes up for lost time by dominating every remaining minute on screen. It appears as though Eleanor upgraded her taste in men to a stud who rides a snazzy motorcycle and makes a living selling racehorse semen. I mean what more could you ask for in a boyfriend?!Joking! In the spirit of art and fashion, I think it's important to point out that Michael was in fact a fashion model in the early '80s. He then made a jump to acting, starring in his first featured film (and one of my all-time faves): 'Sixteen Candles.' Michael then went on to star in another gem: 'Vision Quest.' Mr. Schoeffling happens to be one of my favorite actors and I own most of his cinematic work. He has a mystique that's beyond comprehension. And even though he decided, decades ago, to leave Hollywood in his rear view mirror, his legacy will forever carry on in the hearts and minds of fans near and far. His strong masculine features, dark hair and charismatic charm elevate him at eye level with Hollywood's golden era of leading men, such as: Rock Hudson, Carey Grant, Marlon Brando and James Dean. Michael Schoeffling has left a lasting impression on my heart and I'll continue to wish him peace, love and prosperity.

I don't think it's an easy task for any major film fanatic to claim one scene as their ""sole"" favorite. This includes myself for I know that it's impossible. However, I can list several personal faves that I find positively remarkable. For starters, the scene when Eleanor visits Wilfredo's studio for the first time to attain her dress. I mainly adore the music and the style of his shop. Both Peters and Buscemi have undeniable chemistry together on film! Then comes the sidewalk scene, with what I like to call the 3 Supremettes. It touches my heart when I watch that particular scene, and when you factor in the cold temperature and flawless lip-syncing, you really have no choice but to consider the entire scene legendary! Also, the coat-signing scene at the art show, when several attendees decide to tag Eleanor's plain pink vinyl jacket with black and silver permanent markers. Surprisingly enough, the jacket turned out great and looks totally wearable! The ultimate scene takes place outside after the runway show, when Eleanor finally decides to bite back and gives Stash a piece of her mind. Basically any scene with the pint-sized beauty herself, Bernadette Peters. This talented actress packs a punch on screen! There's a cutesy, charming essence to her style of acting, her articulation and appearance that are all impossible to deny. I have the utmost of admiration for her.

The soundtrack, at the time, was just as profound as the film itself. Public Image's 'Warrior' is rather fitting for the overall atmosphere of this movie, but we only hear a 5 minute sample during the fashion show. 'Good Life' by Inner City represents the hunger one has for the finer things in life and the determination to maintain such a lifestyle. Neneh Cherry's 'Buffalo Stance' (one of my favorite songs from my early childhood) plays precisely as Eleanor and Stash are exiting a party. And Joe Leeway, from Thompson Twins, makes an appearance with what I think was the debut song from his '89 solo project. The beat is actually very infectious, but I'll always prefer Joe as one third of the Thompson Twins.

Every aspect of this film is visually stunning: the striking sets of artists' studios, the dance clubs, wild fashion shows, even the meat-packing district has significance for it is simply nonexistent in 2017. While it's true that it failed to connect with audiences and critics at the time, the movie has gone on to find new life with younger generations of fans. So do not concern yourself with negative reviews because I proclaim not one second of boredom while watching the entire 124 minutes! Although I must admit my discontent with the ending; I refuse to spoil the finale, but the way the scene plays out leaves you to ponder Eleanor's immediate future with herself and her new beau. With that said, I now have developed, to a degree, a sedimental attachment to this movie, and anyone living here in New York City could easily appreciate the raw honesty from the script and the genuine depiction of what's known as the last days of good ol' Manhattan. Slaves of New York makes me feel incredibly thankful for the past and that much more grateful for the digital era of today!",1497830400,,10764,4.854189336235038

7812596,5,6301415841,"This was first a wildly popular book written by Tama Jamowitz who had lived the life depicted in the book. This is the New York City 1980s art scene and in both book and film we get an insider's look at being a member of this community of oddballs. This scene no longer exists in New York because the artists of this ""just hanging on variety"" can no longer afford to live there. New York has so gentrified its neighborhoods that in 2015 only a work about a rich, successful artist would be realistic.  But it would be so much less interesting.

Bernadette Peters, who is more identified with plays on Broadway today, did a marvelous acting job in this film. She is a fiber artist who makes hats. She also has trouble sewing. Peters also made a lot of movies with Steve Martin as his leading lady prior to this. Then she jumped to the Broadway stage and rarely jumped back into film again. She is so closely identified with Martin when it comes to film that it was a great opportunity for her to extend herself by taking on this non-Martin like film.

Some viewers bill this as a Merchant-Ivory ""miss"". I thought it was about time Merchant-Ivory took a risk too and made something contemporary and not rooted back at least a century ago written by Forester or James. This is exactly the last movie you would expect to see them make which is why they needed to do so.
