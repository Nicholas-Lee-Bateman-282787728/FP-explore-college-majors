8639410,5,B00I5I1QB6,"""Banana Ridge"" is a gem of a movie!
I don't have much to say good or bad about ""Aren't Men Beasts,"" but I think ""Banana Ridge"" is one of the funniest British films I've ever seen.  It is entirely devoid of slapstick, slipping on banana peels or falling pianos, for instance, but dishes out British farce from start to finish.  This is done entirely by spoofing British upper class manners and morals, with plenty of ""wink-wink, nudge-nudge"" content and sexual innuendo, and with characters in uncomfortable situations jockeying for position.  Written as a play by Ben Travers, famous for his British farces, it gives us a rollercoaster ride through one embarrassing situation after another while who-knows-what is going on behind the scenes with wives and daughters.  Proper and ridiculous at the same time, I wish I had a dollar for every time the words ""Mr. Pound"" or ""Mr. Pink"" is uttered.  I have no intention of giving away anything about the story; just see it and laugh your sides sore.
One of the players, Adele Dixon, is one of the most striking women I've seen in films.  As Mrs. Pound with her beautiful, toothy smile in a Carol Channing sized mouth and her impeccable British accent and manner, she steals scene after scene.  And watch her walk -- she glides as if she's dancing.  An accomplished stage actress and singer, her film repertoire is sadly small.
The principal male characters are played by the comedy team of Robertson Hare and Alfred Drayton.  They fit their characters in this film better than in ""Aren't Men Beasts,"" in my opinion.  Isobel Jeans plays the other female character who starts the whole thing rolling with one simple visit to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Pound.  The other major players are the Pound's daughter Cora, charmingly played by Nova Pilbeam, and Mr. Jones (or ""Jonesy to those who know him""), played by Patrick Kinsella.  Throw in a rubber plantation in Malaya and you've got a little masterpiece of a movie.",1456617600,,1956,4.771513353115727
