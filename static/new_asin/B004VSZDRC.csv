4484426,5,B004VSZDRC,I wish there were more outings for Vampire Diaries because it is quite entertaining the dynamics on the show and hope there are more in the future...,1363824000,,149,4.555555555555555
4484427,4,B004VSZDRC,It was a fun panel. I liked how the cast and producers and writers played off each other. Great show,1361836800,,100,4.05
4484428,4,B004VSZDRC,"I found the dvd really funny actually and as a fan of the vampire diaries it suited me perfectly. I was suprised about the fact that it didn't have a menu and just played by itself so maybe something to work on is have a menu with like extras or something like that. But overall, a great dvd interview with the cast and it only took like 14 days to get to Britain so I was please with that.",1359849600,2,390,3.949367088607595
4484429,3,B004VSZDRC,"Many of the questions were well thought out. Many of the responses were wonderful and gratifying. But the producers allowed anyone to jump in at any time, and a couple of them did, drowning out the others' responses frequently. You barely get to hear Nina Dobrev at all.",1359676800,2,270,4.645833333333333
4484430,4,B004VSZDRC,"Great dvd and amazing quality!! :-)
I think every vampire diaries fan should own it. It's that awesome and great :-)",1357257600,,116,4.571428571428571
4484431,5,B004VSZDRC,"I absolutely enjoyed this DVD.  The host asked some wonderful questions of the cast, writers and producers.  I do wish that Ian and Paul would let Nina talk though!!  Audience participation was priceless and the stars reactions were so heartwarming.  You get to see just how different they are from their characters and how talented they are as actors.  Ian Somerhalder will be in office one day, take my word for it!",1341964800,,417,4.736111111111111
4484432,5,B004VSZDRC,"This show is so good and I'm officially obsessed with Nina Dobrev. Although I enjoy Vampire Diaries more than True Blood or Twilight, I always wondered if the show was taking their outside ideas and just adapting them...well, in this discussion Producer Kevin Williamson actually talks about how his show is NOT a knock-off!

Everyone in Vampire Diaries is gorgeous, so it was awesome to hear the cast discuss everything that goes in to vampire make up and sexy abs :)  Now that I know just how much work goes into the make up, I don't feel quite as bad about myself! If you're a fan of the show at all, this DVD is a perfect supplement for those annoying days in-between episodes.",1303603200,2,681,4.528455284552845
4484433,5,B004VSZDRC,A genuine cast and writers!  Truly enjoyed watching and listening to everyone of them.,1416528000,,86,5.142857142857143
4484434,3,B004VSZDRC,"The ""TV Series"" itself, I love.. & if I were rating the show opposed to this ""Meet & Greet"" I'd be giving 5 stars. This Q&A format with some cast members, however, was mildly interesting.. & I'd say it's worth watching. I've a strong background in psychology & a few actor/actress(s) were exact opposite than I'd envisioned based on looking into each characters starting point & the journey onto the character in which they've now evolved. Looking at the behaviors each character seems to act most comfortably in & whenever they seemed most natural in their element. Of the few I feel I inaccurately analyzed as ""a person"" & not as ""a character,"" one I was pleased to find myself incorrect.. the other, was a big upset & now near an annoyance to me which I hope doesn't impede how I view the character in future episodes. ""Nina Dobrev"" was the pleasing surprise. I felt strongly given her character ""Elena"" was most highly favored within the entire narrative of the story & given the fact that she plays 2 characters which both capitalize on her natural appearance.. the friends, family, villains & entire community of ""Mystic Falls"" ALL revolve around her central character as she is loathed upon at the center of the attention of the dynamic duo of the ""Salvatore Brothers,"" ..that it would translate through her personality into superior.. almost bratty personality, self-centered.. arrogance personified, but I'm pleased to find that I don't pickup on ANY of those qualities in her. Instead, the idea I had of her as I just mentioned seemed to fit ""Ian"" to a ""t.""  Except I'd add that these attributes all mixed together came across as just plain ""nerdy"" on stage.. seeming often desperate to hang at minimum ""a word"" into every sentence another spoke that resulted in many of the things he crammed in there as sounding one or more of any the following: distasteful, out of context, competing for spotlight, random, or pure cheesy. I don't expect to see the same individual within the series to appear in a Q&A session like this, otherwise they're not very good actors/actresses.. but I'd say that all the cast from the entire series are superior in acting. While I don't expect to see much, if any similarity between who they are in real life opposed to who they are on camera, there's still a common tendency for directors/producers to find some natural shared elements of personality between the off-screen & the on-screen person. ""Damon's"" often man-of-few-words, while witty & often in a comical, smirking way.. calm, cool, collective, smooth..& wise.. But ""Ian"" showed zilch of these qualities in this Q&A. Bonnie, Stefan, Alaric, & Caroline were right in line with how I imagined them to be.. but Ian was a total let down. It's easy for me to imagine that behind the scenes most the rest of the cast secretly looking one to the other often rolling eyes at ""Ian the Know-It-All.""  Stefan or ""Paul"" seems to have an almost magnetic affect on the remaining cast members.. making it easy to see that his company is often enjoyed or even admired. If I could say one short recommendation to Ian, I'd say:  ""The blatant, bad guy with the inflated ego sits very well with ""Damon's"" character; but the empirical, seeming desperate, needy stroke of ego in ""Ian"" at face value.. does a great disservice to you as an actor.""",1411344000,,3323,4.775652173913043
4484435,3,B004VSZDRC,"I never watched VD till recently, like it because there is no nudity or graphic  sex, the characters are fully developed, & the  story line, plot is interesting. I liked getting to meet the main actors and creators on the show, they all have sweet personalities & are very talented & therefore have made the show very entertaining.",1402531200,,331,4.689655172413793
4484436,4,B004VSZDRC,Strangely enough when you hear the cast respond to questions it is almost as if they are in character on set.,1401148800,,109,4.238095238095238
4484437,5,B004VSZDRC,I enjoyed this because I like to see the actors and what they are really like outside of their character roles.  They seem to really like working together and get along well.  It was entertaining.,1399334400,,196,4.571428571428571
4484438,5,B004VSZDRC,"I attended the 2014 TVD PaleyFest show - it was fantastic (except for all the screaming it was hard to hear the actor's respond to the questions) so that is why I like to purchase the DVD's --- they somehow are able to edit out all the screaming so you can actually hear what the actors are saying!  If you like the TVD I would definitely recommend buying these DVD's - they are quite entertaining.  This particular show was when the show was still relatively new, but it was still enjoyable.",1398729600,,492,4.395604395604396
4484439,5,B004VSZDRC,I love the Vampire Diaries! It was great to watch them all interact! I especially love the character of Damon!,1395446400,,110,4.55
4484440,5,B004VSZDRC,"My daughter is in love with this show. She loves the characters and their personalities. It's like a soap opera, a lot of drama but it's vampires.",1389139200,,146,4.444444444444445
4484441,3,B004VSZDRC,I saw a majority of the Paley fest on Hulu so it was nice to watch it all in one sitting again :),1388534400,,97,3.260869565217391
