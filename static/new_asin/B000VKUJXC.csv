2944795,1,B000VKUJXC,"Imagine some guy (whose uncle pretty much has to own a tv network) gets the bright idea of putting a kind of high action Chuck Norris with guns thing in post Katrina New Orleans. Ok, well that could be kinda ok. Imagine he then hires all his stoner, loser, good for nothing friends friends to write shoot and produce this ""concept"". Imagine those friends really are good for absolutely nothing, and the sum is less then their parts.  That is K-Ville.

It is kind of sad that the pilot probably is going to be nothing like the rest of the ill fated series. After all they spent a lot of money to produce one of silliest shows on television, and it isn't even being sold as a comedy.

It might be very amusing to watch as a drinking game or really really stoned. It has some wonderfully (unintentionally) funny bits:

Police do not in general fire weapons at cars, particularly when both cars are moving in a high speed chase, ... in a populated area, ... in broad daylight. When they do open fire they generally don't fire like ammunition is 10 for 1 minimum 100.

Cops running after a suspect driving away at high speeds are not generally able to run to their car (off screen) get in their car (off screen) start their car (you guessed it), and then get up to a speed (yes yes) so they can be almost caught up to the car in the very next moment (oh on screen).  They generally lose the car and other cars find it.

Bullet proof Suvs do not produce 2 foot wide spark explosions when hit by bullets.

Every once in a while bullets hit something other then the windshield, like the seat or the dash or even the people they are aimed at.

As for the plot? Nonsensical. The camera work? Profoundly confusing. The character development? laughably done.",1190246400,8,1746,4.39751552795031

2944798,1,B000VKUJXC,"All those hyped up commercials and advertisements did not meet my expectations to this show. maybe it is just the pilot, but it really did not appeal to me. I knew within the first 5 minutes I was not going to like this show. I looked at my husband and he said, ""give it a chance"". By the end we both agreed we would not be watching it again. The story basically revolves around hurricane Katrina and a handful of cops hanging in there trying to clean up the area and rid the city of crime. I did not think there was any attention grabbers in the episode to make me think to myself "" i'm hooked, or i can't wait to see the next episode"". so i give this show a thumbs down and am really not gonna bother persuing it further. maybe if it comes out on dvd i'll give it another shot. as for the cast, i can say there were many recognizable actors/actress.",1190160000,3,851,4.1017964071856285
2944799,3,B000VKUJXC,"So many cop shows, so little new about them. But the setting elevates K-Ville, giving familiar elements like an officer on the edge, mismatched partners and car chases a new twist. I'm interested in Anthony Anderson's character (he's the angry one, about to break from Katrina wounds that won't heal despite his physical and internal labors). And Cole Hauser's character managed to surprise me at the end, with a twist I didn't expect. It's worth checking out, for sure.",1190160000,5,470,4.962025316455696

No Season Pass for this one!!  The writing was terrible with a plot that was just plain silly.  It is beyond me, how any story set in New Orleans with its rich cultural heritage can't manage even one interesting character, but the whole thing was completely formulaic.  Check out ""Life"" on NBC for a much better series with really interesting, quirky characters.",1190160000,6,520,4.931034482758621
2944802,1,B000VKUJXC,"Eight minutes into this pilot, my husband and I looked at each other and knew we wouldn't be adding this show to our Season Pass list. The premise of New Orleans cops trying to return to normal life post-Katrina is interesting, but not enough time has passed since the disaster to pull it off. Plus, the acting is horrible, the action sequences are laughable, and the plot twists were obvious. I'd be surprised if this shows lasts another week on Fox.",1190160000,2,451,4.580246913580247

8219225,4,B000VKUJXC,"I was a big fan of Miami Vice when I was in High School, and I remember the uproar surrounding it because of the negative light it cast upon that rebuilding city, so K-Ville appealed to me on a number of levels when I first saw the previews. Like Miami, New Orleans has always been one of my favorite cities -- both the fantasy and the reality -- and as a setting for a compelling drama, there's simply no better backdrop than the post-Katrina NOPD, and K-Ville has loads of potential because of it.

Anthony Anderson and Cole Hauser quickly establish themselves as strong leads capable of carrying the series on their charisma and chemistry alone, and if the writers don't quickly find a distinct voice to match the show's setting, that's exactly what they'll have to do. While the pilot episode's formulaic main plot is a bit outlandish, failing to do enough with its intriguing premise while being resolved way too easily, a strong supporting cast -- including Derek Webster as an NOPD deserter trying to get his job, and his dignity, back -- and several intriguing character-driven sub-plots bode well for future episodes.

UNBOX NOTE: I viewed this episode on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creative-Zen-4-GB-Black/dp/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a>&nbsp;and both the audio and video were impressively crisp and clear. Transferring via the Unbox player was quick and easy, too.",1192320000,3,1465,5.3652173913043475
8219226,1,B000VKUJXC,"plan and simple this show was BAD...hoakie sad humor
better off switching to reruns of ""Naked Gun"" @ least you know
they arn't trying to be serious.",1191024000,,148,4.518518518518518
8219227,5,B000VKUJXC,"I enjoyed the show. I thought it was interesting, action packed and very entertaining. It sort of reminded me of the old days when you had the rough cut cop shows like Hill Street Blues.
And sure some of the timing was off and some things were a little unbelievable, but get over it, it's a TV show, nobody ever said it had to reflect real life or portray every single effect with scientific precision. If you expect it too, then you take TV way too seriously!
I thought why not ask a real cop his opinion, so I asked my uncle and my cousin. My uncle is an Asst. Chief and my cousin is resource officer who also works SWAT. They both watch almost every cop show they can. And they both said pretty much the same thing...they enjoyed it, it was something they would be watching again...and yes they said you won't see half of that stuff happening in real life, but that is what made it entertaining to them...because it did not reflect their everyday life...why watch it if you live it? And honestly in most cities...if it were to portray real life cops, then it would make for one enormously boring TV series!
If you want to see a police chase portrayed as it is in real life...go watch a reality cop show...if you just want some entertaining rough cut cop TV to watch....then watch K-ville and keep an open mind to FICTION!",1190937600,2,1324,4.364372469635628
