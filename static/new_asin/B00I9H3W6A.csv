6254423,4,B00I9H3W6A,This is a good movie. Will want to know what happens at the end. A certain female is very funny with her character. She played her part well. Glad to see John Amos still acting. Good Sunday evening movie  to watch after dinner.,1403654400,,227,4.27906976744186
6254424,5,B00I9H3W6A,I enjoyed this film. It's nice to see John Amos still making good films. The entire cast did a good job. Paula Jai Parker and Tamala Jones made the movie interesting. Each character is fully developed and they have their own problems. I liked how each person helped out their friends. This shows the importance of cultivating friendships in life. Your true friends can change your life for the better. Highly recommended for fans of comedies featuring an African American cast.,1403568000,,477,4.901234567901234

6254446,5,B00I9H3W6A,"It was a good and entertaining movie. Glad to see John Amos acting. Music was not so good that was the theme song for the movie,, same string of notes.  But the gospel song was great, never heard it before

Heart warming movie with our people, but some makeup was a bit over, purple lips.  The ending did not make any sense when Torry said the boss man was coming when the man died.  I was surprised to see that and the girl called him  Dad. But it is a good Christian movie with a lot of laughter and helping messages of people trying to help each other when they all are in trouble.  It just followed them, but in the end, they all came out with success.  I liked that.",1419292800,,671,4.076335877862595
