Don't expect something that makes you cry, or distraught, or any of the hollywood emotions that pull you to fascination. Expect to see bits of yourself reflected in every corner of the movie. Expect to see bits of the ones you love, and the confusion they face when just trying to find their happiness.

Well done.",1361923200,,586,4.416666666666667
8553327,5,B000X1Z0HY,"A friend of mine from college recommended this film to me the other
day. It's a gem of a film that I'm sure most people in their twenties
can relate to. The performances are heartfelt and genuine. The issues
the characters face are real and the message of letting go of fears
and embracing life resonated with me. I totally enjoyed this film and
will recommend it to all my friends!",1219795200,,382,4.394366197183099
