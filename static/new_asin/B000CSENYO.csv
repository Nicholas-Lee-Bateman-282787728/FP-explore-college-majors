8101735,3,B000CSENYO,"Ok, there sure is a mystery at Nabda Playa.  It is somewhat interesting to know about.  Then we talk about tar pits and cycles of time.  This is kind of a kitchen sink episode and is relatively weak in terms of the delivery of insights.  And it's really weak to non existent on delivering an understanding of Ancient Egypt.  It fits only barely into the series.  If you had to skip one or two episodes this would be a skip.",1391644800,,423,4.225
8101736,4,B000CSENYO,"Unlike the first two episodes in this symbolic tour of ancient Egypt, Volume 3: Descent wanders away from the ancient knowledge and archeological sites themselves onto an increasingly esoteric road that may well become somewhat boring to average viewers.  My attention certainly kept wandering toward the end.

The contention here is that ancient Egyptian culture basically appeared overnight, with all of its science, religion, writing, etc., in place, and then declined over the next 3000 years.  Oddly enough, the video really doesn't talk about the Middle or New Kingdoms or how this decline manifested itself directly.  The video is more concerned with the idea of a cyclical nature to historical development and spends its first half hearkening back to the pre-ancient civilization West believes existed thousands of years prior to ancient Egypt as we know it.  Compelling evidence for such a pre-ancient Egyptian civilization was offered in the previous two episodes, but now West adds yet another intriguing piece to the puzzle - the Nabla Playa complex that was discovered in the Nubian desert in 1974.  What academics regard as a ritual gathering place is something much more significant to West.  This monolithic stone structure dates back as far as 11,000 years, and it is more than just a collection of stones.  It represents, West tells us, an observatory with which the pre-ancients were able to track the celestial movements of the heavens, demonstrating that, long before civilization is said to have begun, a civilization actually existed - and understood the nature of the precession of the equinoxes.  An expert named Thomas Brophy then comes on to explain the findings of his research of Nabla Playa.  Dubbing the site a calendar circle that was used around 6000 BC, he explains how the large stones were oriented to the equinoxes, particularly the vernal equinox heliacal rising point, with six inner stones corresponding to stars in the constellation Orion.  More amazingly, stones located outside the circle itself accurately reflected the distance to each of these stars.  Obviously, such a finding turns not only Egyptology but history itself on its ear.

If such a scientifically advanced, pre-ancient civilization existed, what happened to it?  West believes it was basically destroyed in the wake of whatever catastrophic event brought about the end of the last Ice Age.  Paleontologist Robert Dunlap discusses the nature of this catastrophic event.  He wanders a little at times (informing us, among other things, that the catastrophe that killed the dinosaurs over 64 million years ago took place in June - and, yes, he explains how scientists could possibly know this), but the upshot of all this is that a Great Flood, which ancient cultures all over the globe speak of in their traditions, following the end of the Ice Age could have wiped out any civilization then existing in northern Africa.  West conjectures that some humans managed to survive this Great Flood, along with a repository of their advanced knowledge.  These people would have passed their knowledge down over the generations until such time as climactic and human conditions would allow for new civilizations to form.  As we know from archaeology, between 4000 and 3000 BC, civilizations suddenly sprang up all across the globe, including ancient Egypt as we traditionally know it.

The video ends with an extended talk by Walter Cruttenden about the cycles of history.  Drawing largely on the Yuga cycles spoken of in the Vedas, he covered ground that was completely new to me, but the upshot of his argument is that human history has four phases which keep repeating themselves in a cyclical manner.  As you can see, we've wandered a little far afield of Egypt by this point, but Cruttenden's ideas can be applied to pre-ancient and ancient Egyptian history.  As enlightening as this kind of information is, it does take us away from the ancient sites themselves, and for that reason this episode is a little less exciting than its predecessors.",1152662400,11,4050,5.1308980213089805
