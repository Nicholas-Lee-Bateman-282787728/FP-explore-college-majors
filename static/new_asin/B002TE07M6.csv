Taken from the writings of Helene Tursten, this crime thriller series lends its way to film very well. Set in Gotenberg, Sweden, gritty seaside port city, the crimes are varied and some quite unusual. The star of this series is Angela Kovacs, who plays Irene Huss. A more natural actor you will not find. She lends herself to the simplicity of intelligent thought and careful mastery of detective work. She is a wife, mother of twin daughters, and a full time detective. From the get go, we can tell she is the go to detective of her department. The others are all intelligent, but have some sort of personality quirk. Irene is quick to pick up clues, quick to win trust of the victims and quick to go off on her own into unsettled and violent areas. However, with her quick wit and physical acuity she is able to sidestep most of the problems she runs into. We are privy to her family life with her chef husband and teenage daughters. Irene is a real person, a real woman with wants, desires and the ability to manipulate her environment. Angela Kovacs is this series, and it is apparent to everyone.

I have not read any of Helene Tursten's books, but I will be on the lookout for them. This is a series of an intelligent and attractive woman, and often that is an enigma.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-12-17",1489276800,,1495,4.488970588235294

(English)
Gothenburg is struck by a series of fires. Irene Huss starts investigating an arson case that may be connected to an event that occurred fifteen years ago, a tragic unsolved case that challenged Irene when she first came to the Violent Crimes Unit.

The population is unnerved by the thought of an arsonist on the loose, and the pressure on Irene and the rest of her team is immense.

In the midst of everything else, a woman has been stabbed to death. The victim, a reclusive old lady, seems to have little in common with the fires that ravage the mainland. But Irene digs deeper into the case and reveals secrets from the past.
