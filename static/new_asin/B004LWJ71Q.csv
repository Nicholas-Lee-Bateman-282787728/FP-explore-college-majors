4405346,5,B004LWJ71Q,"I recommend purchasing season 2 of The Real Housewives of Atlanta. This version of the empire is the most fun to watch in my opinion because the ladies are much more sassy and say the funniest things.

This season we see the gals try and patch up their relationships after several fights at the season one reunion show. Lisa and Kim attempt to mend fences, as do Nene and Kim as well. There is also the new addition of Kandi Burress, (ex member of Xscape) who is smart, sophisticated and ready to hit the world with her new solo project.

Kim and Kandi also get into Kim's music ""career"" with the launch of ""Tardy for the Party""...Nene's none too pleased as she thought she would be singing on the song as well. (Surprise, Nene!) :)

My favorite scene is when Sheree Whitfield goes to her party planner and they get into a fight. ""Who gon' check me boo?"" :)

If you are a fan of the show, you will not be disappointed!",1304121600,4,918,4.319767441860465

4405394,3,B004LWJ71Q,"I find season 2 to be just like my review on Season 1.  Trifling!  It makes me sad and a fair bit stressed to see so many successful women behaving the way they do.  But the luxury!  It's so amazing to look at all of the amazing luxury they live in.  Life styles of the rich and self declared fabulous!!!  Honestly, this group of ladies are totally amazing.  They just need to stop getting hung up on petty issues.  But I guess the show wouldn't sale.  Living not too far from the Atlanta area (Amazon keeps posting Dallas, Gabon!!!), I like looking at this show and seeing all of these really nice stores and restaurants that I didn't even know were in Atlanta and surrounding areas.  It's totally interesting to find out what's in your back yard on television.",1358640000,,762,4.41726618705036
4405395,4,B004LWJ71Q,GREAT ENTERTAINMENT AND MARATHON SESSION FOR A RAINY OR COLD DAY OF LAUGH OUT LOUD REAL ITY TELEVISION AT HOME..,1356134400,,112,4.65

4405397,5,B004LWJ71Q,"I must confess that the Atlanta Housewives and New Jersey Housewives are my guiltiest pleasures.  The ladies from both franchises are most enjoyable and most endearing. That being said, I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would want to put themselves and their families on display this way.  But, that's what makes them even more intriguing, I suppose.

The second season of the Atlanta Housewives marks several milestones: 1) the welcome addition of the amazing Kandi Burruss; 2) the last season with Lisa Wu Hartwell; 2)the last season in which NeNe Leakes still had flashes of not being so completely consumed with self and image; 4) and of course (drum roll), the HAIR PULL!

What made me want to buy this season was Kandi Burruss - talented, funny and most of all she gives the appearance that what we viewers see is who Kandi is in her downtime.  Her reaching out to Kim, her struggles with the situation with AJ and her mother and her having to deal with AJ's passing were the heart of this season.  The way Kandi consistently handles herself often makes the other ladies looks so frivolous and shallow.  Additionally, Kandi appears like someone who would be great fun to hang out with!

For me, the last ATL season when the ladies where still somewhat real.  Subsequent seasons saw their BRANDS take center stage.",1340582400,2,1334,4.740259740259741
