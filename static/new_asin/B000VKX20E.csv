8219252,3,B000VKX20E,One of the authors said it all when he complained that the church is largely irrelevant to the needs of the people.  The church is just not producing what it says it produces:  Disciples for Christ Jesus Our Lord..,1438214400,,214,4.461538461538462
8219253,1,B000VKX20E,"I am a (non-traditional) bible college student with plans on working with unchurched culture and issues the world faces today.

I admit, the video description sounded very interesting. It captivated my attention and was quickly added to my shopping cart.

Three days later, the package arrives with ""Rebellion of Thought"", I was thrilled to watch it. I had just finished about a 13 hour work day and homework for the following day.  It was almost 11:30PM when I made the determination to watch it.

As a student in media arts and video I am a bit picky when it comes to finalized video projects, however I am flexible with independent productions.

Ok, it was about 10 minutes into the film and the shaky, very strange (horror film )introduction was still playing. I had to speed things up to get to the content.

Wow! Holy smoke! The film started off with two (unknown) fat guys in a motel room, mumbling about ""post-modernism"". The main character talking was laying prostrate across a cheap motel bed, dirty socks and all talking with the other dude about ""post-modernism"". It seriously looked like two guys on a road trip, simply ""shooting the crap"" about the idea of ""post-modernism"". While the main guy was talking, the other guy has a look like, ""when is the pizza dude going to get here?""

The next scenes were the same dudes munching on chips at a Mexican restaurant still mumbling on about their theology. The camera was shaking as though it was a kid or very unexperienced camera operator managing the shot. One of the guys was actually talking low as though he didn't really want anyone to hear what he was saying out loud.

More time went on, and I was still anticipating actual useful content from this film. The next few scenes were other guys who were like private college philosophers rattling on with personal theories.  I will mention, maybe a few lines from the professors and such was good information.

This poorly produced film moved on with no promising content. It actually lost the whole theme and starting playing ""tulipy"" Presbyterian music with more scenes of the two guys standing around different water fronts. Yawn! Yawn! I kept trying to endure this film with good intentions.

The subtitle of ""Rebellion of Thought"" is ""post-modernism, the church and the struggle for authentic faith."" For me, it was a struggle for my attention.

Overall, the film was horribly produced. The theme was not amplified nor followed through with a sense of remedy to the whole problem with ""post-modernism"".

Not one time during this poorly produced film did anyone reach out to anybody and offer a remedy for the idea of post-modern culture, etc.

I feel very disappointed with this film and less informed about how the 21st century church can be effective with a generation, who abandoned Christianity and church.

Christian produced films should not be in the category of crap, just cause it's Christian. All this does is keep adding more reproach on churches, etc.

I do not recommend this film at all. It will be hard to follow and very odd with the strange music and unknown characters ""theorizing"" from a lazy stupor.

Be warned!",1299283200,,3149,4.812615955473098
8219254,2,B000VKX20E,"I am very disappointed in this film.  Mostly because it seems like it is talking about two different subjects at the same time.  On the one hand, the film interviews some experts in the field of philosophy and theology, who fairly effectively trace the history and progression of postmodern thought.  On the other hand, there are the two film makers who simply discuss their unhelpful and sometimes irrelevant to the discussion ideas.

The brothers Williamson are asking questions that have little to do with postmodernism and more to do with their own personal dissatisfaction with the church.  It's like they made this film to throw out their own ideas and advertised it as a film on postmodernism.  While some of the interviews with the experts are helpful in clarifying trends in postmodern thought, this video as whole is unhelpful as a whole.",1240963200,4,848,4.936619718309859
8219255,1,B000VKX20E,"Arrogance is awash in this video.  The 'postmodern' style in which it is filmed is really nothing more than self promotion.  It's extremely annoying and distracting to the point of not being able to follow what's being said.  Is there any real point to having three people involved in the speaking of the same sentence, other than to show how cutting edge the editors are?  The only reason I bought this was because of D.A. Carson's name, but don't be fooled. The video is just about how avante garde and in tune with God's purpose for the church are the makers of the film.  If only we had their spiritual discernment we could join them in looking down on the rest of the church.  As it is, I think there is enough of that condescending, un-Christlike attitude already. I wonder if they think Jesus has given up on his church as well. Now there's a thought.",1212364800,6,858,4.467948717948718
8219256,5,B000VKX20E,"I recommend Rebellion of Thought with no reservations.  It puts forth a very clear understanding of the general mindset of our postmodern world.  It is not about whether you like postmodernity or not, but its reality and how is surrounds us and the fundamentally different way that the western culture arbitrates what we accept as true and not true.  It is critical of the institutional church denominations because our pews are filled with people who might have orthodox belief systems but don't live their lives congruent with the claims of Jesus.  Veith is one of my favorite authors on the subject.  This would be tremendous to view either with a group of secular Genxers, or with those who are entrenched in modernity and totally committed to our traditional church structures.  The video production is totally postmodern-styled editing as well and the video communicats about as much as the audio track does.  In all cases the video reinforces what is being said with strong clear immages.  The discussion about relativism in morality being the only way to approach life is incapable of addressing the reality of objective evil that we see.  All voice are not worthy of a seat at the table of discussion and are not of equally compelling morality and just contextualized.  Scenes from Hitler reinforce this point dramatically.  Get a copy of this to watch if you care about authentic Christian faith and want to challenge your thinking outside the traditional boxes.",1202947200,4,1472,4.991803278688525
